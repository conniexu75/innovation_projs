https://openalex.org/W2152381343,"The proteins encoded by the classical HLA class I and class II genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are highly polymorphic and are essential in self versus non-self immune recognition. HLA variation is a crucial determinant of transplant rejection and susceptibility to a large number of infectious and autoimmune diseases. Yet identification of causal variants is problematic owing to linkage disequilibrium that extends across multiple HLA and non-HLA genes in the MHC. We therefore set out to characterize the linkage disequilibrium patterns between the highly polymorphic HLA genes and background variation by typing the classical HLA genes and >7,500 common SNPs and deletion-insertion polymorphisms across four population samples. The analysis provides informative tag SNPs that capture much of the common variation in the MHC region and that could be used in disease association studies, and it provides new insight into the evolutionary dynamics and ancestral origins of the HLA loci and their haplotypes."

Mutations in the gene encoding OPA1, a protein required for fusion of mitochondria, are associated with hereditary autosomal dominant optic atrophy type I. Here we show that mitochondrial fragmentation correlates with processing of large isoforms of OPA1 in cybrid cells from a patient with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers syndrome and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts harboring an error-prone mitochondrial mtDNA polymerase γ. Furthermore, processed OPA1 was observed in heart tissue derived from heart-specific TFAM knock-out mice suffering from mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and in skeletal muscles from patients suffering from mitochondrial myopathies such as myopathy encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. Dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential leads to fast induction of proteolytic processing of OPA1 and concomitant fragmentation of mitochondria. Recovery of mitochondrial fusion depended on protein synthesis and was accompanied by resynthesis of large isoforms of OPA1. Fragmentation of mitochondria was prevented by overexpressing OPA1. Taken together, our data indicate that proteolytic processing of OPA1 has a key role in inducing fragmentation of energetically compromised mitochondria. We present the hypothesis that this pathway regulates mitochondrial morphology and serves as an early response to prevent fusion of dysfunctional mitochondria with the functional mitochondrial network.

Mitochondria fulfill a number of essential functions in the eukaryotic cell. One such process is oxidative phosphorylation, a process that generates the vast majority of cellular ATP. Therefore, it is not surprising that many muscular and neurological disorders, various forms of cancer, diabetes, obesity, and aging, are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (1Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 6DiMauro S. Schon E.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2656-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in many of these diseases or conditions aberrant mitochondrial morphologies are observed (1Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev.

Neurol. 1985; 17: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Mitochondria in numerous cell types form a large network of interconnected tubules that is maintained by a balance of fission and fusion events (8Nunnari J. Marshall W.F. Straight A. Murray A.

Deficiencies in mitochondrial fusion and fission play an important role in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A and 4A, and optic atrophy type 1 (10Alexander C.

Genet. 2001; 28: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Fusion of mitochondria, in particular of the inner mitochondrial membrane, depends on the presence of a mitochondrial membrane potential (23Malka F. Guillery O. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Guillou E. Belenguer P. Lombes A. Rojo M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Legros F. Lombes A. Frachon P. Rojo M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4343-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Still it is unclear how mitochondrial dysfunction and fragmentation of mitochondria are linked on a molecular level. Here we report on a major molecular player, namely OPA1, in this process. Mutations in the OPA1 gene are known to cause hereditary autosomal dominant optic atrophy type I, the most prevalent hereditary neuropathy of the optic nerve occurring with a prevalence of 1:12,000 to 1:50,000, depending on the population (10Alexander C.

The OPA1 protein is required for mitochondrial fusion (27Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol.

Overexpression of OPA1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts promotes tubulation of mitochondria (28Cipolat S. de Brito O.M. Dal Zilio B. Scorrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Down-regulation of OPA1 leads to fragmentation of mitochondria, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered mitochondrial inner membrane morphology, and increased propensity for apoptosis (15Lee Y.J.

Eight alternatively spliced mRNAs transcribed from the OPA1 gene and several tissue-specific isoforms of the OPA1 protein were described (31Satoh M. Hamamoto T. Seo N. Kagawa Y. Endo H. Biochem.

The ortholog of OPA1 in bakers' yeast, Mgm1, is essential for mitochondrial fusion (33Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J.

Vogel F. Bornhövd C. Neupert W. Reichert A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27781-27788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Formation of s-Mgm1 depends on an ATP-dependent mechanism termed alternative topogenesis (36Herlan M. Bornhövd C. Hell K. Neupert W. Reichert A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, the bioenergetic state of mitochondria was proposed to be linked to their morphology. Here we report that in mouse and human the orthologous protein OPA1 has a key role in linking the bioenergetic state of mitochondria to mitochondrial morphology, albeit in a mechanistically distinct manner. Cell Culture and Reagents—HeLa cells, human fibroblasts, immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast from control (mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines 13 and 14) and mutator mice (mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines 2 and 7) (37Trifunovic A.

The plasmid pMSCV-Opa1, encoding a mouse variant of OPA1 corresponding to human spliceform 1, was a kind gift of Luca Scorrano (Padova, Italy) (28Cipolat S. de Brito O.M. Dal Zilio B. Scorrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The DRP1K38E N-terminally fused to cyan fluorescent protein (pECFP-C1-DVLPK38E) and mitochondrially targeted GFP plasmids (pcDNA3-OCT:GFP) were kind gifts of Heidi McBride (Ottawa Heart Institute, Canada). Transient transfections of HeLa cells were performed using Metafectene (Biontex Laboratories, Germany) or FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). Tissue Samples—Heart tissue was obtained from heart-specific TFAM knock-out mice as described earlier (40Hansson A. Hance N. Dufour E. Rantanen A. Hultenby K. Clayton D.A. Wibom R. Larsson N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3136-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle biopsies were derived from patients diagnosed with respiratory chain disorders (patients 1-10) or control patients (control patients A-D) with no such defects. Informed consent was given by all patients. Patients 1-10 included in this study were previously diagnosed with respiratory chain disorders suffering from mitochondrial encephalomyopathies or isolated myopathies on the basis of clinical, biochemical, morphological, and, in some cases, genetic findings. The activities of the respiratory chain complexes of all control patients were within the normal range. Measurements of rotenone-sensitive NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complexes II and III). and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) were determined spectrophotometrically in skeletal muscle homogenates according to Fischer et al. (41Fischer J.C. Ruitenbeek W. Gabreels F.J. Janssen A.J. Renier W.O. Sengers R.C. ter Stadhouders A.M. Laak H.J. Trijbels J.M. Veerkamp J.H. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1986; 144: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Activities were expressed as units per gram of noncollagenous protein and related to the mitochondrial marker enzyme citrate synthase. Homogenates from skeletal muscle biopsies were analyzed by Western blotting, and band intensities were determined densitometrically from the immunoblot. Antibodies—Anti-OPA1 antibodies were affinity-purified from a rabbit polyclonal serum raised against the C terminus of human OPA1 using the synthetic peptide CDLKKVREIQEKLDAFIEALHQEK (Pineda Antikörper-Service, Berlin). Antibodies against human MIA40 were raised in rabbits using purified MIA40 fused to maltose-binding protein. Polyclonal rabbit sera against hTim23 and hTim44 were raised as described previously (42Bauer M.F. Gempel K. Reichert A.S. Rappold G.A. Lichtner P. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mouse anti cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12; BD Biosciences), anti-DRP1 (DLP1 clone 8; BD Biosciences), and anti-β-actin (clone AC-15; Sigma) monoclonal antibodies were used for immunoblotting. The goat anti-AIF (D-20) and rabbit anti-Fis1 sera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and IMGENEX, respectively. The anti-Mfn2 serum was a kind gift of Antonio Zorzano (University of Barcelona, Spain). Fluorescence Microscopy—Live cells were fluorescently labeled with MitoTracker® Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for mitochondria or with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Molecular Probes) for the nucleus after fixation and permeabilization. Immunostaining was carried out with mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (clone 6H2.B4; BD Biosciences) and chicken anti-GFP antibody (Aves Lab Inc.). The following secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent dyes were used: Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-chicken IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were mounted with Prolong® Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). All treatments were done according to the manufacturers' instructions. Mitochondrial morphology was analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) equipped with a ×63 objective. For all imaging, 512 × 512 pixel images of single confocal planes were acquired and processed with the Bitplane Imaris 4 software. At least 100 cells were analyzed for each slide of each condition or cell line. Error bars represent standard deviations calculated from three to five slides. Pulse-Chase Experiments—HeLa cells were seeded on 6-well plates (105 cells per well). One day later, the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and starved for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without sodium pyruvate, l-methionine, and l-cystine (Invitrogen). Pulse labeling was started by addition of the metabolic labeling reagent (Tran35S-label, MP Biochemicals Europe), and cells were incubated for 2 h 30 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and either harvested at that time point or incubated further with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, harvested, lysed in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm EDTA, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture purchased from Roche Applied Science), and submitted to immunoprecipitation with OPA1 antibodies and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Preimmune serum was used in control experiments. The elution fractions of the different immunoprecipitation experiments were analyzed by Western blotting and digital autoradiography after SDS-PAGE using the same membrane. Subcellular Fractionation of Cells—Cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, and resuspended in 1 ml of RSB buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were broken by six passages through a 26-gauge needle fitted to a 5-ml syringe. Cell pellets from low speed centrifugations (2,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) were resuspended in RSB buffer and passaged again through a needle as described. This step was repeated 3 to 4 times. The supernatants from low speed centrifugations were pooled and centrifuged again (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to obtain a crude mitochondrial pellet and a cytosolic supernatant. MERRF Cybrid Cells Show Fragmentation of Mitochondria and Alterations in OPA1 Isoforms—In a first approach to study the molecular mechanism of fragmentation of mitochondria in human diseases, we investigated the role of fusion-promoting OPA1 in a cybrid cell line derived from a MERRF patient suffering from severe myopathy (39Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The mtDNA in the cell line contained the A8344G mutation in the tRNALys in a nearly homoplasmic manner leading to a substantial impairment of mitochondrial function (39Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The cells from the MERRF patient, but not control cells, showed highly fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 1, a and b). The pattern of the five detected OPA1 protein isoforms was altered in the MERRF cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1c). It appears that in the MERRF cells the larger isoforms are reduced compared with the smallest isoform of OPA1. As OPA1 is required for mitochondrial fusion, the observed loss of large OPA1 isoforms may explain the fragmentation of mitochondria in this model system of mitochondrial dysfunction. Mutator Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts Show Fragmentation of Mitochondria and Alterations in OPA1 Isoforms—To further substantiate this, we analyzed immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from the so-called “mutator mouse” (37Trifunovic A. Wredenberg A. Falkenberg M. Spelbrink J.N. Rovio A.T. Bruder C.E. Bohlooly Y.M. Gidlof S. Oldfors A. Wibom R. Tornell J. Jacobs H.T. Larsson N.G. Nature. 2004; 429: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar, 38Trifunovic A. Hansson A. Wredenberg A. Rovio A.T. Dufour E. Khvorostov I. Spelbrink J.N. Wibom R. Jacobs H.T. Larsson N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17993-17998Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). This mouse was generated by a homozygous knock-in of a variant of mtDNA polymerase γ resulting in a phenotype of premature aging. The variant enzyme has much reduced proofreading activity, and mtDNA accumulates random point mutations at a 3-5-fold higher rate than normal leading to severe mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria were extensively fragmented in mutator but not in control cell lines (Fig. 2, a and b). The levels of the larger OPA1 isoforms were strongly reduced, whereas the levels of the smaller forms were increased in the mutant cells (Fig. 2c). These findings suggest that mutations in mtDNA are causative to changes in OPA1 isoform levels and mitochondrial fragmentation. Patterns of OPA1 Isoforms Are Altered in Tissue Samples Exemplary of Mitochondrial Dysfunction—TFAM is an essential mitochondrial transcription factor also required for mtDNA maintenance. A heart-specific knock-out of TFAM in mice led to a severe depletion of mtDNA in the heart, resulting in cardiomyopathy and altered mitochondrial morphology (40Hansson A. Hance N. Dufour E. Rantanen A. Hultenby K. Clayton D.A. Wibom R. Larsson N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3136-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The pattern of OPA1 isoforms in heart tissue of these mice was changed as compared with controls; the abundance of larger OPA1 isoforms was reduced, whereas that of smaller isoforms was increased (Fig. 3a). This was even more pronounced at 8 weeks compared with 4 weeks of age (Fig. 3a), consistent with the progression of the cardiomyopathy in those mice (40Hansson A. Hance N. Dufour E. Rantanen A. Hultenby K. Clayton D.A. Wibom R. Larsson N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3136-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This shows that mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from mtDNA depletion is linked to the reduction of larger OPA1 isoforms in the affected tissue. Moreover, the alterations of mitochondrial morphology observed earlier by electron microscopy (40Hansson A. Hance N. Dufour E. Rantanen A. Hultenby K. Clayton D.A. Wibom R. Larsson N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3136-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) are likely because of the shift in the levels of OPA1 isoforms. In addition, we checked whether alterations in the OPA1 isoform pattern are detectable in patients diagnosed with respiratory chain defects. Indeed, an increase of smaller OPA1 isoforms was observed in skeletal muscle from these patients but not from controls (Fig. 3b). This was quantified by determining the ratios of the amounts of the smallest OPA1 isoform (arrow in Fig. 3b) to the total of all OPA1 isoforms (Fig. 3c). Besides the shift patients exhibited a much broader variation compared with controls. The patients with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes or harboring a MELAS mutation were among those with the highest ratios (Fig. 3c, patients 1 and 7 and Table 1). In none of the controls did we observe such a shift. We conclude that OPA1 isoforms are altered in patients with mitochondrial disorders, in particular those with depletion of or mutations in mtDNA.TABLE 1Genetic and biochemical analysis of mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle biopsies from patients and controlsSamplesRespiratory chain enzyme activitiesGeneticsRelative amount of smallest OPA1 isoform of total%ANormal6.7CNormal7.5BNormal10.7DNormal14.75I, 10%Unknown14.79I, 80%II/III, 40%IV, 20%Unknown16.32IV, 20%Unknown17.38I, 70%II/III, 60%IV, 10%A1541G mutation in SCO218.76I, 30%Unknown22.14I, 30%IV, 30%mtDNA depletion22.73I, 30%II/III, 80%IV, 30%Unknown22.910I, 50%II/III, 50%IV, 20%mtDNA depletion23.57I, 50%II/III, 50%IV, 80%MELAS A3243G mutation in tRNA-Leu(UUR)39.71I, 50%II/III, 50%IV, 20%mtDNA depletion51.2 Open table in a new tab Dissipation of the Membrane Potential Leads to Mitochondrial Fragmentation and to Proteolytic Conversion of Larger into Smaller Isoforms of OPA1—Next we asked whether dissipation of the membrane potential is sufficient to trigger changes in the abundance of OPA1 isoforms and whether this coincides with fragmentation of mitochondria. Indeed, treatment of HeLa cells or fibroblasts with the uncoupler CCCP led to fragmentation of mitochondria (Fig. 4a; data not shown) consistent with earlier reports (23Malka F. Guillery O. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Guillou E. Belenguer P. Lombes A. Rojo M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Ishihara N. Jofuku A. Eura Y. Mihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 26Legros F. Lombes A. Frachon P. Rojo M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4343-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this coincided with a dramatic shift of OPA1 isoforms toward the smaller isoforms (Figs. 3c and 4b). A similar behavior was reported recently in another study performed in parallel (43Ishihara N. Fujita Y. Oka T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2966-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Processing is specific to OPA1 as other known fusion and fission components such as Mfn2, Drp1, and Fis1 are not processed (Fig. 4c). To test whether the two larger OPA1 isoforms are converted into the smaller ones upon dissipation of the membrane potential, we performed metabolic, radioactive pulse labeling of HeLa cells followed by a chase in the absence or presence of CCCP for 1 h. We could confirm that indeed the two larger OPA1 isoforms (L1- and L2-OPA1) are converted into the smaller ones (S3-, S4-, and S5-OPA1), in particular into S3- and S5-OPA1 (Fig. 4d). This is apparently because of proteolytic cleavage of the larger forms because this process was blocked in the presence of the protease inhibitor o-phenanthroline (Fig. 4e). Processing of OPA1 occurs within mitochondria because all OPA1 isoforms detected remain in the mitochondrial fraction and are not released to the cytosol after subcellular fractionation (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, the smaller isoforms produced could be extracted from mitochondria with detergent-free buffer with a higher efficiency than the larger forms suggesting that the larger forms are integral membrane protein isoforms, and the shorter ones are only peripherally attached to the membrane (Fig. 4g). Other mitochondrial proteins, including three intermembrane space proteins (cytochrome c, AIF, and hMIA40), are not processed supporting further that processing is specific for OPA1 (Fig. 4, f and g). Fragmentation of mitochondria occurred rapidly within 15-30 min after addition of CCCP (Fig. 5, a and b). This is because of a block in mitochondrial fusion as shown earlier (23Malka F. Guillery O. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Guillou E. Belenguer P. Lombes A. Rojo M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Legros F. Lombes A. Frachon P. Rojo M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4343-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Processing of OPA1 took place within the same narrow time frame (Fig. 5c). Impairment of fusion of mitochondria may therefore be due to rapid inactivation of OPA1 by proteolysis of larger isoforms. Moreover, upon removal of CCCP, normal mitochondrial morphology was recovered, and this coincided with the reappearance of larger isoforms of OPA1 (Fig. 5, a-c). Mitochondrial fragmentation and OPA1 processing are not accompanied by cytochrome c release in this or in any of the investigated models of mitochondrial dysfunction (Figs. 1a, 2a, and 4e and data not shown). This suggests that mitochondrial fragmentation per se does not result in apoptosis consistent with an earlier report (15Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5Proteolytic processing and resynthesis of large OPA1 isoforms parallel dynamic changes of mitochondrial morphology. Cells were treated or not (Control) with CCCP (20 μm) for 30 min, washed, and incubated with medium lacking CCCP for the indicated time periods, or CCCP (20 μm) was left for 6 h.

Lombes A. Frachon P. Rojo M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4343-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). We asked whether OPA1 processing and resynthesis of OPA1 isoforms, respectively, could explain these earlier observations. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) did not interfere with fragmentation and OPA1 processing (Fig. 5, a-c). This indicates that fragmentation of mitochondria and activation of OPA1 cleavage are independent of protein synthesis. However, recovery of a tubular mitochondrial network as well as the parallel reappearance of larger OPA1 isoforms was impaired in the presence of CHX (Fig. 5, a-c). Therefore, mitochondrial fragmentation and the shift of OPA1 isoforms are not reversible without ongoing protein synthesis consistent with the explanation that a proteolytic inactivation of OPA1 causes mitochondrial fragmentation. To show the causal and specific role of OPA1 in this process, we decided to check whether OPA1 overexpression can block uncoupler-induced fragmentation. Indeed, fragmentation of mitochondria after CCCP treatment was largely prevented upon overexpression of OPA1 (Fig. 6, a and b). This suggests that OPA1 is directly involved in the fragmentation of mitochondria induced after loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. A similar effect was observed after the expression of a dominantnegative variant of DRP1 (DRP1K38E) that prevents fission of mitochondria (Fig. 6, a and b). To check whether overexpression of OPA1 or of a dominant-negative variant of DRP1 (DRP1K38E) affects the rate of uncoupler-induced conversion of large OPA1 isoforms into smaller OPA1 isoforms, we performed a pulse-chase experiment. Indeed, overexpression of OPA1 slowed down the processing of OPA1 as indicated by the prolonged presence of L1- and L2-OPA1 when compared with the control overexpression of GFP or of DRP1K38E (Fig. 6c). This effect may even be underestimated also because endogenous OPA1 from about 50% of nontransfected cells contributes to the signal. Thus, additional expression of large isoforms of OPA1 blocks CCCP-induced mitochondrial fragmentation consistent with the proposed fusion-promoting activity of a large but not a short OPA1 isoform (43Ishihara N. Fujita Y. Oka T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2966-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative variant of DRP1 (DRP1K38E) does not affect the rate of OPA1 processing but blocks mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 6, a-c). Thus, the fragmentation that occurs by a block of mitochondrial fusion depends on the normal DRP1-dependent fission pathway. However, processing of OPA1 appears to occur independently from ongoing mitochondrial fission. The processes of mitochondrial damage leading to dysfunction, breakdown of mitochondrial bioenergetic competence, and mitochondrial fragmentation are linked through a cascade of reactions. Here we have identified a central molecular player, namely OPA1, that links changes in mitochondrial morphology with mitochondrial dysfunction. Our conclusions are based on a wide variety of established model systems and patient material exemplary for MERRF, MELAS, mtDNA depletion syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy, diseases with respiratory deficiencies of unknown origin, and aging. We put forward an hypothesis that describes how this cascade is organized. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to impairment of bioenergetic competence of mitochondria. This results in reduced membrane potential and ATP production. In such compromised mitochondria, a proteolytic processing of large to small isoforms of OPA1 is activated. As a consequence, fusion of mitochondria is blocked, and due to ongoing mitochondrial fission dysfunctional mitochondria are segregated from the network of intact mitochondria. A key element of the mechanism proposed here is the regulatory inactivation of fusion-promoting OPA1 by proteolytic cleavage. In the case of the homolog of OPA1 in yeast, Mgm1, lack of either of the proteolytically generated large or small isoforms leads to impairment of mitochondrial fusion (35Herlan M. Vogel F.

Commun. 2003; 308: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We propose that, in a similar way, loss of the two larger isoforms of OPA1 in humans leads to a deficiency in mitochondrial fusion. This is strongly supported by the following observations. 1) OPA1 is required for mitochondrial fusion (27Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 29Chen H. Chomyn A. Chan D.C. J. Biol.

Guillery O. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Guillou E. Belenguer P. Lombes A. Rojo M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Ishihara N. Jofuku A. Eura Y. Mihara K. Biochem.

Nunnari J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 3) Both OPA1 processing after uncoupler treatment as well as resynthesis of OPA1 after removal of uncoupler occur in the same time frame as fragmentation and refusion of mitochondria. 4) Overexpression of OPA1 blocks uncoupler-induced fragmentation of mitochondria and slows down processing of large OPA1 isoforms. 5) In particular, the large isoform of OPA1 but not the short isoform was shown to promote mitochondrial fusion (43Ishihara N. Fujita Y. Oka T. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2966-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In yeast, mitochondrial dysfunction causes a deficiency in the import of the Mgm1 precursor. Consequently, formation of the small isoform and mitochondrial fusion are impaired (36Herlan M. Bornhövd C. Hell K. Neupert W. Reichert A.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In humans, mitochondrial dysfunction is sensed in a different fashion, which is independent of protein synthesis and consequently protein import into mitochondria. Still, this leads to the specific, rapid, and intramitochondrial inactivation of the orthologous effector protein, OPA1. We propose that this fast and sensitive molecular mechanism that connects mitochondrial functionality and morphology separates dysfunctional from functional mitochondria. This serves mainly two purposes highly relevant to the progression of mitochondrial diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. First, it would reduce further damaging of mtDNA by reactive oxygen species by the spatial separation of damaged mitochondria from the intact tubular network. Second, it would enable the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy or more specifically mitophagy. In principle, mitophagy was shown to be increased in some systems of mitochondrial dysfunction (46Priault M. Salin B. Schaeffer J. di Vallette F.M. Rago J.P. Martinou J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 48Skulachev V.P. Bakeeva L.E. Chernyak B.V. Domnina L.V. Minin A.A. Pletjushkina O.Y. Saprunova V.B. Skulachev I.V.

OPA1-dependent counter-selection of damaged mitochondria is an intracellular process that does not depend on cell division-based selection. It is therefore of particular importance in the aging process and in post-mitotic tissues. Indeed, predominantly these tissues are affected in myopathies and neurodegenerative disorders caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, mutations in OPA1 are known to be causative to hereditary optic atrophy type 1 (10Alexander C. Votruba M. Pesch U.E. Thiselton D.L. Mayer S. Moore A. Rodriguez M. Kellner U.

Therefore, impairment of OPA1 function may result in impaired separation of damaged mitochondria contributing to the pathomechanism of this neurodegenerative disorder. This, however, does not exclude that impairment of mitochondrial fusion leads to a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, low respiration rate, slow cell growth, and increased susceptibility to apoptosis by other mechanisms as proposed earlier (29Chen H.

In addition, the large intestinal loops were distended, with colonic mucosa exhibiting an aberrant growth pattern and the colonic crypt proliferative zone being greatly expanded in slc26a3-null mice.

Deletion of slc26a3 results in chloride-rich diarrhea and is associated with compensatory adaptive up-regulation of ion-absorbing transporters. The SLC26A3 or DRA (down-regulated in adenoma) gene was originally identified in a subtractive hybridization screen comparing the mRNAs expressed in colon cancer and normal colon tissue (1Schweinfest C.W. Henderson K.W. Suster S. Kondoh N. Papas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4166-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). DRA is expressed in normal colonic epithelium, but is absent or reduced in adenomas and adenocarcinomas (1Schweinfest C.W. Henderson K.W. Suster S. Kondoh N. Papas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4166-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies identified SLC26A3 (DRA) as a member of a large conserved family of anion exchangers (SLC26) that encompass at least 10 distinct genes (2Bissig M. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Koller T. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Xu J. Henriksnas J. Barone S. Witte D. Shull G.E. Forte J.G. Holm L. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C493-C505Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Except for SLC26A5 (prestin), all function as anion exchangers with versatility with respect to transported anions (2Bissig M. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Koller T. Meier P.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2005; 289: C493-C505Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies localized SLC26A3 on the apical membrane of colonic mucosa, with lower levels in the small intestine (4Hoglund P. Haila S. Socha J. Tomaszewski L. Saarialho-Kere U.

In humans, SLC26A3 encodes a 764-amino acid protein and is located on chromosome 7 in a head-to-tail arrangement with SLC26A4 (pendrin), indicating ancient gene duplication. Genetic analysis studies linked mutations in DRA (SLC26A3) to congenital chloride-losing diarrhea (CLD 5The abbreviations used are: CLD, chloride-losing diarrhea; ES, embryonic stem; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; KO, knock-out. ; OMIM accession number 214700), a disease manifested by enhanced chloride loss in the stool and volume depletion (4Hoglund P.

Functional studies in vitro have demonstrated that SLC26A3 can mediate multiple anion exchange modes, including Cl-/HCO3- , Cl-/oxalate, and Cl-/hydroxyl, and possibly sulfate/hydroxyl exchanges (6Melvin J.E.

Purif. 1998; 12: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similar anion exchange activities have been described previously in apical membranes of the colon (27Rajendran V.M. Binder H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G132-G137PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tyagi S. Kavilaveettil R.J. Alrefai W.A. Alsafwah S. Ramaswamy K. Dudeja P.K. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2001; 226: 912-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the site of abundant DRA expression. To initiate an investigation into the role of DRA in an in vivo model, we created slc26a3 (dra) gene-targeted mice that are null for expression of the slc26a3 gene. This mouse model closely resembles the clinicopathological presentation of human CLD. Functional studies demonstrated that slc26a3-null mice have significantly reduced levels of apical chloride/base exchange activity in the colon and display unique and distinct adaptive regulation of ion transporters in the proximal and distal colon. In addition, the loss of slc26a3 produces an expansion of the proliferative zone of the colonic crypt epithelium, suggesting a role for loss of slc26a3 expression in colon tumor progression. Isolation of Mouse slc26a3 Genomic Clones—A mouse 129S6/SvEv strain genomic library in the vector Lambda Dash II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened by plaque hybridization using human DRA cDNA as a probe. A 19-kbp fragment containing at least exons 2-9 was isolated. The identity of the clones was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization and partial sequencing. Targeting Vector Construction—Restriction enzyme mapping revealed the presence of an AgeI restriction site on exon 2 of the mouse dra genomic DNA that was suitable for insertion of the neo cassette. The neo cassette contains the neomycin phosphotransferase gene under the transcriptional control of the RNA polymerase II promoter and the last exon and polyadenylation signal of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene for termination. In addition, the neo cassette is flanked by the loxP/Cre recombinase recognition sequences (kindly provided by K. Thomas). The AgeI site of the neo cassette insertion is located 39 bp downstream of the ATG start codon of the dra gene. The targeting vector contains 5.6 kbp of isogenic genomic DNA upstream and 8 kbp of isogenic genomic DNA downstream of the AgeI site. The targeting vector was linearized with SfiI, which cleaves the vector backbone, prior to electroporation into embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES Cell Electroporation—TC1-10 ES cells (kindly provided by Dr. P. Leder) were grown on feeder layers of mouse fibroblasts in knock-out Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% serum replacement medium and made complete as described previously (29Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). ES cells (2 × 107) were electroporated with 68 μg of linearized vector using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 600 V and 25 microfarads. Transfected cells were treated with G418 (230 μg/ml) for positive selection. Drug-resistant ES cell clones were expanded and screened for homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis of their genomic DNA (see Fig. 1A). Three of 40 drug-resistant clones were generated and identified by this method. Generation of slc26a3 (dra) Knock-out Mice—The ES cells from three of the positive colonies were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts and implanted in the uteruses of pseudopregnant female mice. Chimeric males that demonstrated significant agouti coat color were mated with BL6 females to generate heterozygotes, which were initially identified by the same Southern blot strategy used to identify targeted ES cell lines. Subsequently, the slc26a3 genotyping was conducted by PCR using two slc26a3 exon 2-specific primers and a primer specific for the RNA polymerase II gene (see below). Genotyping of Mice—Genotyping was performed on tail DNA obtained from mice at weaning and placed directly into 250 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, and 0.45% Tween 20). PCR was performed with the following primers: mouse slc26a3 exon 2, 5′-GGCAAAATGATCGAAGCCATAGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATGGTCCAGGAATGTCTTGTGATGTC-3′ (reverse); and neo cassette RNA polymerase II, 5′-GGAAGTAGCCGTTATTAGTGGAGAGG-3′ (reverse). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 32 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 3% low melting point agarose (see Fig. 1B) in 45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Luminal Chloride, Sodium, and pH Measurement—The chloride assay was performed using a diagnostic kit obtained from Sigma (catalog no. 461-3) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, stool samples from the animals were collected, weighed, lyophilized, weighed again, resuspended in water at 5-100 mg/ml, and then heated to 65 °C for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge, and the supernatant was removed and assayed for chloride. The sodium assay was performed by flame photometry. The pH of the intestinal content was assayed using a pH microelectrode. Histopathological Examination of Mouse Tissues—Mice were killed, and tissues were harvested within 10 min. Tissues were fixed in Amsterdam solution and then processed and embedded in paraffin blocks using standard methods. Sections were cut and stained using hematoxylin/eosin or subjected to immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence labeling as described (13Wang Z. Petrovic S. Mann E. Soleimani M. Am. J.

RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Hybridization—Total cellular RNA was extracted from various mouse tissues, including ileum, proximal and distal colon, duodenum, and kidney, according to established methods; quantitated spectrophotometrically; and stored at -80 °C. Total RNA samples (5-30 μg/lane) were fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to Magna NT nylon membranes, cross-linked by UV light, and baked. Hybridization was performed according to established protocols (30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed, blotted dry, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare). The following DNA fragments were used as specific probes for Northern hybridization: for NHE3, a fragment encoding nucleotides 1883-2217; for SLC26A6, a fragment encoding nucleotides 51-488; for colonic H,K-ATPase, three pooled PCR products from rat (nucleotides 135-515, 2369-2998, and 3098-3678); and for ENaCα, ENaCβ, and ENaCγ, fragments encoding nucleotides 1197-1890, 58-671, and 135-790, respectively. Each Northern hybridization was performed on separate samples from three different animals. Immunoblotting and/or Immunohistochemical Labeling of slc26a3 and nhe3 in Mouse Intestine—slc26a3+/+ and slc26a3-/- mice were killed with a sodium pentobarbital overdose and perfused through the left ventricle with 0.9% saline, followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Intestinal segments were removed, cut into tissue blocks, and fixed overnight in formaldehyde solution at 4 °C. The tissues were frozen on dry ice, and 6-μm sections were cut with a cryostat and stored at -80 °C until used. Immunohistochemical labeling was performed as described (13Wang Z. Petrovic S. Mann E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G573-G579Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) using SLC26A3-specific antibodies. For immunoblot analysis, microsomal membranes from the proximal colon were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and membranes were blotted with anti-SLC26A3 or anti-NHE3 antibodies. Each blot was performed on three separate samples from three different animals. 36Cl and 22Na Transport Measurement—The uptake of 36Cl or 22Na by luminal membrane vesicle suspensions, pooled from the proximal colons of three mice and prepared according to established methods (17Wang Z.

The reaction was stopped by ice-cold medium. The radioactivity in each filter was assayed by scintillation spectroscopy. Vesicles and all experimental media were continuously gassed with 100% N2 or 5% CO2 and 95% N2. The uptake of 4 mm measured under three different conditions: no pH gradient (pHi/pHo 7.5/7.5 without CO2/HCO3- ), outward pH gradient (pHi 7.5/pHo 6.0 without CO2/HCO3- ), and outward pH and bicarbonate gradients (pHi 7.5/pHo 6.0 with CO2/HCO3- ). The bicarbonate concentrations were 25 mm at pH 7.5 and 0 mm at pH 6.0. The uptake of 1 mm 22Na was measured under two different conditions: no pH gradient (pHi 7.5/pHo 7.5) and inward pH gradient (pHi 6.0/pHo 7.5) without CO2/HCO3- . Each radioactive uptake experiment was repeated on three different samples. Materials—[32P]dCTP, 36Cl, and 22Na were purchased from Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences. Nitrocellulose filters and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The RadPrime DNA labeling kit was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-SLC26A6 antibodies was raised in our laboratories (13Wang Z. Petrovic S. Mann E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G573-G579Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Antibodies against SLC26A3 peptides were custom-generated by Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) as described (33Byeon M.K. Westerman M.A. Maroulakou I.G. Henderson K.W. Suster S. Zhang X.K. Papas T.S. Vesely J. Willingham M.C. Green J.E. Schweinfest C.W.

Statistical analysis was examined using Student's t test or analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. An slc26a3 gene-targeted allele was generated in ES cells using a targeting vector containing the neo cassette inserted into exon 2 of an isogenic 129 strain dra genomic clone as shown in Fig. 1A. Three germ line chimeric founder males were generated from dra gene-targeted ES cells and were used to breed in a C57BL6 background. Genotype analysis of offspring was performed by a three-primer PCR using the strategy shown in Fig. 1B. The targeted allele produced a 220-bp PCR fragment, whereas the wild-type allele produced a 115-bp fragment. Fig. 1B shows a typical genotyping demonstrating wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous knock-out (KO) animals. DRA is expressed in a limited subset of tissues, including small and large intestines, intraprostatic seminal vesicles, and eccrine sweat glands (4Hoglund P. Haila S. Socha J. Tomaszewski L.

However, the intestines express DRA to the greatest degree (4Hoglund P. Haila S. Socha J. Tomaszewski L. Saarialho-Kere U. Karjalainen-Lindsberg M.L. Airola K. de la Holmberg C. Chapelle A. Kere J.

Therefore, to test for generation of a null allele via gene targeting, we performed Northern blot analysis on RNAs from the ilea and colons of wild-type and homozygous animals (Fig. 1C). The results showed that the homozygous individuals were completely devoid of DRA mRNA expression. Heterozygous intercross mating was performed to determine whether the dra KO allele is transmitted to the subsequent generation in Mendelian ratios. Table 1 shows the results of genotype analysis of 409 such offspring at weaning and reveals a non-Mendelian distribution of genotypes (40.6% wild-type, 43.8% heterozygous, and 15.6% KO). The deviation from Mendelian ratios is highly significant (p < 0.0001) for both heterozygous and homozygous animals, suggesting a dra gene dosage affect on viability, albeit at reduced penetrance. Table 2 shows the results of mating between heterozygous and homozygous KO littermates. Again, the weaned offspring demonstrated a non-Mendelian distribution that is a highly significant departure from expected Mendelian ratios (p = 0.0002).TABLE 1Distribution of genotypes among 409 progeny of dra heterozygotous matingsGenotypeNo. of offspringϰ2p valueObservedExpecteddra+/+166102.25dra+/−179204.50dra−/−64102.25Total40940957.235aϰ2 was calculated as Σ(observed - expected)2/expected.<0.0001bThe p value was determined from an unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed).a ϰ2 was calculated as Σ(observed - expected)2/expected.b The p value was determined from an unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed).

Open table in a new tab To determine whether dra disruption affects the gross morphology of the developing embryo, we examined the intestinal morphology during embryogenesis. We have shown previously that dra gene expression commences in the gut at embryonic day 16.5 postcoitus (33Byeon M.K. Westerman M.A. Maroulakou I.G. Henderson K.W. Suster S. Zhang X.K. Papas T.S. Vesely J. Willingham M.C. Green J.E. Schweinfest C.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 387-396PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we harvested embryos at day 18.5 postcoitus. There were no detectable differences in the gross morphology or architecture of the intestines of dra-deficient mice and their normal siblings (data not shown). The expected Mendelian ratios for heterozygous mating was observed among the embryos (data not shown), suggesting that postpartum lethality is responsible for the non-Mendelian ratios observed later. Surviving dra-deficient mice exhibited diarrhea with elevated chloride content. Fig. 2A shows that the chloride level of stool specimens from dra-deficient mice (mean ± S.D. of 28.37 ± 6.66 μg/mg (dry weight)) was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than that from wild-type and heterozygous animals (mean ± S.D. of 1.87 ± 0.79 μg/mg (dry weight)). In addition, stools from the dra-deficient mice had a higher water content compared with those from their control littermates (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2B), although the stools were not as watery as described in human CLD. In addition, homozygous animals occasionally developed prolapsed rectums. Finally, dra-deficient mice were smaller compared with agematched heterozygous and wild-type animals (p = 0.0007) (Fig. 2C) and had greatly shortened life spans (mean ± S.D. of 121.6 ± 50.8 days). These observations are consistent with the conditions in human CLD, which is characterized by voluminous watery diarrhea with high chloride content and growth retardation in untreated individuals (35Holmberg C. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1986; 15: 583-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patients treated with electrolyte replacement continue to have watery, high chloride content diarrhea, but have normal life spans (35Holmberg C. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1986; 15: 583-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in human DRA are the cause of CLD (4Hoglund P. Haila S. Socha J. Tomaszewski L. Saarialho-Kere U. Karjalainen-Lindsberg M.L.

Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dra-deficient mouse model closely resembles the molecular etiology and clinical manifestations of human CLD. Other morphological and histological aspects distinguished the dra KO mice from normal animals. Upon immediate postdeath dissection, dra-deficient mice presented with distension of the large bowel (Fig. 3I, panels A-C) compared with wild-type mice (panel D). The small intestine was not affected in this manner. Such intestinal dilation is consistent with pre- and postpartum observations of human CLD and is due to increased volume of the bowel contents (35Holmberg C. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1986; 15: 583-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined the morphology of the colonic tissue. Whole mount preparations of colons that were sliced open longitudinally, fixed, and stained with methylene blue revealed a starkly altered mucosal morphology in dra-deficient mice compared with those in heterozygous and wild-type mice. Fig. 3II (panels A-C) shows an abnormal growth pattern of the mucosal surface wherein the crypt orifices were conjoined rather than distinct as in normal mucosa (panel D). This conjoined phenotype was observed in sections from both the proximal and distal colons of KO mice, but not in the ilea (data not shown). Fig. 3II (panel E) demonstrates serial sections (8 μm) down through an example of conjoined crypts. It shows that the conjoined crypt phenotype occurred at the very top of the crypt, which is closest to the lumen (panel E). SLC26A3 functions predominantly as a chloride/base exchanger in vitro (6Melvin J.E. Park K. Richardson L. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

To ascertain the role of SLC26A3 in mediating chloride/base exchange in vivo, apical membrane vesicles were isolated from the proximal colons of wild-type and slc26a3-null mice and assayed for chloride/base exchange using the 36Cl influx method. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, the influx of radiolabeled chloride mediated via Cl-/OH- and Cl-/HCO3- exchange decreased by 76 and 69%, respectively, in apical membrane vesicles from the colons of slc26a3-null mice (p < 0.001 versus wild-type mice). The reduction in apical chloride influx correlated with results from immunoblot analysis demonstrating the complete absence of slc26a3 protein in the colons of KO mice (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Expression and activities of ion transporters in slc26a3 KO mouse colon.

To ascertain the molecular mechanism of enhanced electrolyte absorption in the colon, the expression and/or activities of the apical Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, the electrogenic sodium channel, and colonic H,K-ATPase were examined. NHE3 mRNA expression was increased by 2- and 3-fold in the proximal and distal colons, respectively, from slc26a3-null mice (p < 0.001 versus wild-type mice; n = 4) (Fig. 4C). Immunoblotting confirmed the up-regulation of NHE3 in the proximal colons of slc26a3 KO mice (Fig. 4D). The enhanced expression of NHE3 was associated with increased Na+/H+ exchange activity in luminal membrane vesicles isolated from the colons of slc26a3 KO mice (Fig. 4E). Colonic H,K-ATPase is expressed in the distal colon and is predominantly responsible for the absorption of potassium. Colonic H,K-ATPase mRNA was increased by ∼4-fold in the distal colons from slc26a3 KO mice (p < 0.001 versus wild-type mice; n = 4) (Fig. 4F). In addition to NHE3 and colonic H,K-ATPase, an electrogenic Na+ channel is expressed on the apical membranes of the distal colon and is involved in the absorption of sodium. Northern analysis showed significant up-regulation of the ENaC α-, β-, and γ-subunits in the distal colons of slc26a3 KO mice (p < 0.001 versus wild-type mice; n = 4) (Fig. 4G). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of the colonic crypts further distinguished slc26a3-deficient animals from their normal littermates. By these methods, we determined the expression patterns for dra and the retinoblastoma protein and p53 tumor suppressor genes, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen proliferation marker, and incorporated bromodeoxyuridine. In addition, the expression of cyclins A, B1, D1, E, and H, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory proteins p27, p21, and p16 was examined. Most of these proteins showed similar expression patterns in all three dra genotypes (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 5, several had notable differences that distinguished the homozygous mice from the heterozygous and"

Here we investigate the role of the mitochondrial citrate/isocitrate carrier (CIC) in regulation of GSIS. Inhibition of CIC activity in INS-1-derived 832/13 cells or primary rat islets by the substrate analogue 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) resulted in potent inhibition of GSIS, involving both first and second phase secretion. A recombinant adenovirus containing a CIC-specific siRNA (Ad-siCIC) dose-dependently reduced CIC expression in 832/13 cells and caused parallel inhibitory effects on citrate accumulation in the cytosol. Ad-siCIC treatment did not affect glucose utilization, glucose oxidation, or ATP/ADP ratio but did inhibit glucose incorporation into fatty acids and glucose-induced increases in NADPH/NADP+ ratio relative to cells treated with a control siRNA virus (Ad-siControl). Ad-siCIC also inhibited GSIS in 832/13 cells, whereas overexpression of CIC enhanced GSIS and raised cytosolic citrate levels. In normal rat islets, Ad-siCIC treatment also suppressed CIC mRNA levels and inhibited GSIS. We conclude that export of citrate and/or isocitrate from the mitochondria to the cytosol is an important step in control of GSIS.

Mitochondrial CIC occupies a critical position in intermediary metabolism, serving as a key carbon source for the fatty acid and sterol biosynthetic pathways and for cytosolic NADPH production. Moreover, recent reports indicate that mouse islets lack malic enzyme activity (25MacDonald M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E302-E310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and that siRNA-mediated suppression of cytosolic NADP-dependent ICDc activity strongly impairs GSIS, pyruvate cycling, and NADPH production (18Ronnebaum S.M. Ilkayeva O. Burgess S.C. Joseph J.W. Lu D. Stevens R.D. Becker T.C. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. Jensen M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30593-30602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that CIC could play a particularly important role in regulation of insulin secretion. In the current study, we have tested this hypothesis and demonstrate that inhibition of CIC with the specific substrate analogue 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) or by siRNA-mediated suppression of its expression results in potent inhibition of GSIS, whereas CIC overexpression stimulates GSIS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—The cell line 832/13 (26Hohmeier H.E.

Relative to the start codon, the first nucleotides targeted by each duplex were as follows: 136 (CIC 136; AGT CTT CAC GTA TTC GGT CTT), 233 (CIC 233; CCG AAT ACG TGA AGA CTC ATT), 682 (CIC 682; CCG TGA AGG TGA AAT TCA TTT), and 922 (CIC 922; GCT ACT GTA CTG AAG CAG GTT). A scrambled siRNA sequence with no known gene homology (GAG ACC CTA TCC GTG ATT A) was used as a control. siRNA duplexes were introduced into 832/13 cells at ∼50% confluence by nucleofection, using the AMAXA system and the manufacturer's protocols (Gaithersburg, MD). Experiments were performed 3 days after duplex transfection.The CIC136 and scrambled control siRNA sequences were used to prepare recombinant adenoviruses by previously described methods (28Bain J.R.

The trap system was closed, and then the wells with media were injected with 70% perchloric acid. The trap was incubated on a shaker at 125 rpm for 90 min. NaOH was transferred to scintillation vials containing UniScint BD scintillation fluid, mixed, and then counted. Glucose incorporation into lipid was measured as previously described (33Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

Cells were loaded with rhodamine 123 (2.6 μm Rh123 for 20 min) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Fluorescence was excited at 490 nm and measured at 530 nm. Images were captured and analyzed using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA). Exposure time was 0.2 s, and images were acquired at ∼0.2 Hz. Cells were first treated with low glucose (2.8 mm) for 5 min and then with high glucose (20 mm) for 10 min. Changes in fluorescence were determined by comparison of the fluorescence at 20 mm glucose over the last 5 min of treatment with the average fluorescence over the first 50 s of exposure to 2.8 mm glucose, with the latter value set as 100%. At the end of an experiment, 1 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone was added to assess cell viability and to test the ability of the cell loaded with Rh123 to respond to changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential induced by the chemical uncoupler.Measurement of Citrate by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry—Total citrate levels were measured relative to an added 2H4-citrate internal standard (IsoTec) by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, as previously described (13Jensen M.V.

Cytosolic and mitochondrial citrate levels were measured by the same method, with the following modifications. At the end of the secretion assay, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with saponin (80 μg/ml) for 20 min (30 million cells/ml) to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane of cells in suspension without causing cell death (36Koshkin V.

Supernatant was collected, representing the cytosolic fraction, and the cell pellet, representing the mitochondrial fraction, was resuspended in 650 μl of 0.1 n HCl, and each fraction was used for citrate analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.CIC Immunoblot—Cellular proteins were extracted with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and pepstatin (5 μg/ml). Extracts (40 μg) were resolved on 10% Bis-Tris SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). CIC was detected with a rabbit antibody against CIC (1:1000) (38Capobianco L. Bisaccia F. Michel A. Sluse F.E. Palmieri F.

Islets were incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 medium containing 8 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 20 units/ml penicillin, 20 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.05 μg/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen). Insulin secretion was performed with 20 islets for each condition. Islets were washed and incubated for 1 h in KRBH-bovine serum albumin secretion buffer containing 4.38 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 129 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm NaHEPES (Sigma), 3.11 mm CaCl2, 0.25% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 2.8 mm glucose. Islets were then incubated for 2 h in secretion buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose or 16.7 mm glucose in the presence or absence of 30 mm KCl. Insulin secretion and insulin content were measured as previously described (35Joseph J.W. Koshkin V. Saleh M.C. Sivitz W.I. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Chan C.B. Wheeler M.B. J. Biol.

Cells were treated with 1000 particles/ml of Ad-siCIC or Ad-siControl adenoviruses for 3 days unless otherwise stated.Islet Perifusion—60 islets were loaded onto a Swinnex 13 column containing a nylon filter (Millipore, Burlington, MA). The chamber was perifused with KRBH-bovine serum albumin buffer with or without the addition of 0.5 or 2 mm BTC and containing various secretagogues at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a Gilson Minipuls 3 pump (France). The temperature was maintained at 37 °C using an eight line in-line solution heater (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Islets were perifused at low glucose (2.8 mm) for 45 min prior to each experiment. The solution was gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to achieve a pH of 7.4 and maintained at 37 °C.Statistics—Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test or by one-way or two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures followed by multiple Bonferroni comparisons. All data are expressed as means ± S.E.RESULTSThe CIC Inhibitor BTC Inhibits GSIS in 832/13 Cells—As a first step in evaluation of the potential role of CIC in regulation of GSIS, we used the substrate analogue 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC; Sigma) to inhibit its activity in robustly glucose-responsive INS-1-derived 832/13 cells. 2.0 mm BTC significantly inhibited both glucose-stimulated (16.7 mm) and glucose + KCl-stimulated (16.7 mm glucose + 30 mm KCl) insulin secretion without affecting basal insulin secretion (Fig. 1A). The effects of BTC on the -fold response to glucose were dose-dependent (Fig. 1B). Treatment of cells with 2 mm BTC resulted in reduction of the -fold response of GSIS from 6.5 ± 1.0-fold in control (non-drug-treated) cells to 3.9 ± 0.7-fold. As would be expected of an inhibitor of CIC and mitochondrial citrate export, BTC significantly reduced the incorporation of radiolabeled glucose into the organically extractable lipid fraction (Fig. 1C). Insulin content was slightly decreased in response to 2 mm BTC in 832/13 cells (3052 ± 377 versus 2571 ± 134 microunits/μg of DNA; p < 0.05). None of the aforementioned effects of BTC could be ascribed to cytotoxicity, since treatment of 832/13 cells for 3 h with 2 mm BTC had no effect on cell viability, as assessed either by the ToxiLight cytotoxicity assay or the MTS mitochondrial dye method (data not shown).The CIC Inhibitor BTC Inhibits GSIS in Isolated Rat Islets—We next sought to determine whether BTC inhibits GSIS in primary rat islets. In static incubation experiments, the addition of 2 mm BTC to islets inhibited insulin secretion in response to 16.7 mm glucose or 16.7 mm glucose + 30 mm KCl compared with islets incubated in the absence of the drug (Fig. 2A). To learn more about the effects of BTC on the phases of insulin secretion, we performed islet perifusion studies involving preperifusion with 2.8 mm glucose for 45 min, followed by 2.8 mm glucose for 15 min, 16.7 mm glucose plus or minus BTC (0.5 or 2 mm) for 30 min, and then 15 min with 16.7 mm glucose + 30 mm KCl in the absence of BTC. These experiments revealed that BTC inhibited both the first and second phases of insulin secretion in response to 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2The effect of BTC on insulin secretion in isolated rat islets. A, insulin secretion measured by static incubation (2 h); B, insulin secretion measured by islet perifusion. The islet perifusion studies were performed in the presence or absence of 0.5 or 2 mm BTC, added during stimulation with high glucose (HG; 16.7 mm).

The four CIC-specific siRNA duplexes reduced CIC mRNA levels by 50–77% and caused impairment of insulin secretion in response to high glucose to degrees (25–49%) in proportion to their efficacy for knockdown of CIC expression (Fig. 3, A and B). Treatment of 832/13 cells with CIC siRNA duplexes did not affect insulin content compared with siControl-treated cells (data not shown).FIGURE 3Effects of suppression of CIC expression via four different siRNA duplexes in 832/13 cells. Four distinct siRNA duplexes specific for CIC (siCIC136, siCIC233, siCIC682, and siCIC922) or a control siRNA duplex with no known sequence homology (siControl) were introduced into 832/13 cells by electroporation, followed by 48 h of tissue culture before beginning the experiment.

Treatment of 832/13 cells with Ad-siCIC caused a virus dose-dependent decrease in CIC mRNA levels compared with cells treated with a control adenovirus (Ad-siControl) (Fig. 4A). Treatment of 832/13 cells with Ad-siCIC also resulted in a 53 ± 8% reduction in CIC protein levels compared with cells treated with Ad-siControl or Ad-βGal (Fig. 4B). Based on these studies, two viral doses were selected for further experiments, “low” (100 particles/cell), which caused no significant decrease in CIC mRNA levels, and “high” (500 particles/cell), which caused a suppression of 75 ± 3% relative to Ad-siControl-treated cells. The low dose of Ad-siCIC did not affect glucose- or glucose + KCl-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas the high dose of Ad-siCIC inhibited both glucose-stimulated (47 ± 2%) and glucose + KCl-stimulated insulin secretion (45 ± 2%) compared with cells treated with either Ad-"

The primary structures of COX-1 and COX-2 are very similar except that COX-2 has a 19-amino acid (19-AA) segment of unknown function located just inside its C terminus. Here we provide evidence that the major role of the 19-AA cassette is to mediate entry of COX-2 into the ER-associated degradation system that transports ER proteins to the cytoplasm. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many cells, whereas COX-2 is usually expressed inducibly and transiently. In murine NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, we find that COX-2 protein is degraded with a half-life (t½) of about 2 h, whereas COX-1 is reasonably stable (t½ >12 h); COX-2 degradation is retarded by 26 S proteasome inhibitors. Similarly, COX-1 expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells is quite stable (t½ > 24 h), whereas COX-2 expressed heterologously is degraded with a t½ of ∼5h, and its degradation is slowed by proteasome inhibitors. A deletion mutant of COX-2 was prepared lacking 18 residues of the 19-AA cassette. This mutant retains native COX-2 activity but, unlike native COX-2, is stable in HEK293 cells. Conversely, inserting the COX-2 19-AA cassette near the C terminus of COX-1 yields a mutant ins594–612 COX-1 that is unstable (t½ ∼3 h). Mutation of Asn-594, an N-glycosylation site at the beginning of the 19-AA cassette, stabilizes both COX-2 and ins594–612 COX-1; nonetheless, COX mutants that are glycosylated at Asn-594 but lack the remainder of the 19-amino acid cassette (i.e. del597–612 COX-2 and ins594–596 COX-1) are stable. Thus, although glycosylation of Asn-594 is necessary for COX-2 degradation, at least part of the remainder of the 19-AA insert is also required.

Structural and biochemical studies have shown that COX-1 and COX-2 are unusual integral membrane proteins in that the enzymes associate monotopically with the luminal surfaces of the ER and the contiguous inner membrane of the nuclear envelope (10Picot D.

COX-1 is constitutively expressed in resting cells of many tissues (16Smith W.L. Willis A.L. Handbook of Eicosanoids: Prostaglandins and Related Lipids. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 175-184Google Scholar). COX-2 expression can be induced in fibroblast, epithelial, endothelial, macrophage, and smooth muscle cells in response to growth factors, cytokines, and proinflammatory stimuli and expression is usually transient (reviewed in Refs. 1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 149-182Crossref Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 17Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Differences in the patterns of expression of COX-1 and COX-2 genes have been quite clearly delineated in serum-stimulated NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (19Herschman H.R. Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. J. Lipid Med. 1993; 6: 89-99PubMed Google Scholar, 20DeWitt D. Meade E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Evett G.E. Xie W. Chipman J.G.

COX-1 mRNA and protein levels remain unchanged before and after serum stimulation of quiescent NIH/3T3 cells. In contrast, COX-2 mRNA and protein are barely detectable prior to stimulation, become significantly upregulated shortly after stimulation, and then rapidly decline to basal levels. It is well established that the different profiles of COX-1 and COX-2 expression as observed in serum-stimulated NIH/3T3 fibroblasts are partly attributable to differences in regulation of the isoforms at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 149-182Crossref Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 17Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys.

It is not clear the degree to which COX-1 and COX-2 may also be regulated differently at the post-translational level. However, rapid degradation of COX-2 protein may serve a significant physiological role in regulating the levels of prostanoids whose syntheses occur via this isoform. Previous studies have indicated that COX-2 can be ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome in the cytoplasm (22Shao J. Sheng H. Inoue H. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. J. Biol.

We also confirm that although COX-2 is an ER-resident enzyme, its degradation is proteasome-dependent. In investigating the molecular basis for the different rates of COX-1 and COX-2 degradation, we found that the 19-amino acid cassette unique to COX-2 (Asn-594–Lys-612) and located 6 residues in from the C-terminal end targets the protein for entry into the ERAD pathway (s) (29McCracken A.

Bovine calf serum was from Hyclone. Cycloheximide, puromycin, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were obtained from Sigma. Kifunensine, MG132, epoxomicin, E64, and leupeptin were purchased from Calbiochem. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Cold arachidonic acid was purchased from Cayman Chemicals, whereas [1-14C]arachidonic acid (55 mCi/mmol) and [1-14C]eicosapentaenoic acid (55 mCi/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals.Construction of Plasmids for Transfection—Recombinant ovine (ov) COX-1 cDNA and human (hu) COX-2 cDNA were subcloned into pIND (Invitrogen) and pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen), respectively. pIND is ecdysone-inducible, whereas pcDNA5/FRT/TO is tetracycline-inducible. After subcloning, the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create the following C-terminal mutants: N594A huCOX-2, del595–612 huCOX-2, del597–612 huCOX-2, and ins594–596 ovCOX-1. The COX-1 insertion mutants, ins594–612 ovCOX-1 and ins594–612(N594A) ovCOX-1, were created from the cDNA template for native ovCOX-1 by overlap extension PCR and then subcloned into pIND using HindIII restriction sites. Correct cDNA orientation and mutations were confirmed by sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH/3T3 fibroblasts at early passage (<6 passages) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. To induce COX-2 expression, the cells were first made quiescent by serum starvation for 48 h in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine calf serum and thereafter treated with DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS for 4 h.RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. To stimulate COX-2 expression, the cells were challenged with 200 ng/ml LPS.HEK293-derived cell lines stably expressing native or mutant COX constructs were generated using either the tetracycline-inducible or the ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression systems (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Constructs that were expressed under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter were native huCOX-2, del595–612 huCOX-2, N594A huCOX-2, and del597–612 huCOX-2; those expressed under the control of the ecdysone-inducible promoter were native ovCOX-1, ins594–612 ovCOX-1, ins594–612(N594A) ovCOX-1, and ins594–596 ovCOX-1. Stably transfected HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and the appropriate pharmacological selective reagents. Inducible expression was achieved by a 24-h serum starvation in serum-free medium followed by treatment with 10 μg/ml tetracycline or 10 μm ponasterone A (ecdysone analog) for the appropriate times in normal culture medium.Protein Degradation and Drug Treatments—A cycloheximide (CHX) decay experiment was performed to measure the protein stabilities of COX-1 and COX-2 in serum-treated NIH/3T3 cells. Briefly, quiescent cells were serum-stimulated for 4 h and then incubated for different times with 50 μm CHX in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The protein degradation experiment was performed in the absence or presence of MG132 (20 and 50 μm), epoxomicin (3 and 5 μm), 25 μm leupeptin, and 25 μm E64.HEK293 cells inducibly expressing wild-type or mutant cyclooxygenase constructs were grown to 80% confluency, serum-starved for 24 h, and then treated with 10 μg/ml tetracycline or 10 μm ponasterone A in complete culture medium to induce expression. Afterward, the cells were incubated for various times with 50 μm puromycin to block translation in the absence or presence of 20 μm MG132, 25 μm kifunensine (KIF), or 50 μm KIF.Enzymatic Deglycosylation—For complete deglycosylation of cell proteins, HEK293 whole cell lysates were denatured by boiling in NuPAGE SDS sample loading buffer (Invitrogen) and then treated for at least 12 h with Endo H at a concentration of 0.4 milliunits/μl.Western Transfer Blotting—After the appropriate treatments, NIH/3T3, RAW 264.7, and HEK293 cells were scraped into ice-cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by sonication. Radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was also used for cell lysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The NuPAGE system (Invitrogen) was used to resolve the proteins in the whole cell lysates on a 7% Tris-acetate polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotting was performed with the appropriate primary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunodetection was performed using the Western Lighting chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to x-ray film. Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences).Antibodies Specific for COX-1 or COX-2—A previously generated (12Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), peptide-specific, polyclonal primary antibody for murine (mu) COX-2 against the epitope Ser-598–Lys-612 was used in the current study to detect muCOX-2 by immunoblotting. A polyclonal antibody raised against whole recombinant ovCOX-1 was used to detect muCOX-1. Peptide-specific, polyclonal primary antibodies for ovCOX-1 and huCOX-2 were synthesized by Covance Research Products against the following epitopes: Leu-272–Gln-283 of ovCOX-1 and Pro-583–Asn-594 of huCOX-2.Immunocytofluorescence—Stably transfected HEK293 cells were grown on poly l-lysine-coated coverslips and induced with either 10 μg/ml tetracycline or 10 μm ponasterone A for the appropriate times. After fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, the coverslips were blocked in 0.1% Triton-X-100 solution supplemented with 10% goat serum. Thereafter, the coverslips were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody against either ovCOX-1 or huCOX-2, extensively washed with PBS, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). After three additional extensive washes with PBS, the coverslips were dried and mounted onto glass slides using Prolong antifade kit (Invitrogen). Microscopy was conducted on a Zeiss Atto Arc® 2 HBO 100W fluorescence microscope at a magnification of ×200.Expression and Purification of muCOX-2 and del595–612 muCOX-2—N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged muCOX-2 and del595–612 muCOX-2 were expressed in Sf21 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). The recombinant baculovirus that was generated was used to infect cultures of Sf21 cells. After 72 h of infection, the cells were harvested and used to purify protein. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 5% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Following sonication, whole cell lysates were treated with C10E6 (0.8% v/v) for 1 h, centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min, and further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h to precipitate insoluble material. After adding imidazole to a final concentration of 10 mm, the solubilized supernatant was incubated with fast-flow nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and poured onto a column that was washed extensively with starting buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with 20 mm Tri-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 5% glycerol, 0.1% C10E6, and 200 mm imidazole. Eluted fractions were concentrated with Centriprep-30 centrifugal filters (Millipore) to ∼1 ml after washing twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 5% glycerol, and 0.1% C10E6. The final protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce).Cyclooxygenase O2 Electrode Assay—Cyclooxygenase assays were performed at 37 °C by monitoring the initial rate of O2 uptake using an oxygen electrode as described previously (35Song I. Ball T.M. Smith W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by adding purified enzyme to the assay chamber containing 3 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenol, 1.67 μm hematin, and varying concentrations of arachidonic acid. Km and Vmax values were determined using concentrations of arachidonic acid between 0 and 200 μm.Cyclooxygenase TLC Assay—A radio-TLC assay was performed to examine cyclooxygenase product formation as previously described (36Wada M. Yokoyama C. Hatae T. Shimonishi M. Nakamura M. Imai Y. Ullrich V. Tanabe T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified enzyme (∼23 milliunits) was incubated with a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenol, 10 μm hematin, and [1-14C]arachidonic acid or [1-14C]eicosapentaenoic acid at room temperature for 30 s. The reaction was terminated by adding 300 μl of an ice-cold mixture of ethylether, methanol, 0.2 m citric acid (30:4:1). The organic phase of the reaction mixture, containing the radioactive products, was isolated and applied directly onto a TLC silica plate at 4 °C. The plate was developed in ethyl acetate, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, acetic acid, water (110:50:20:100) and exposed to x-ray film, and radioactive products were visualized by autoradiography.RESULTSRapid, Proteasome-dependent Degradation of COX-2—COX-1 is expressed constitutively in murine NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, whereas COX-2 is expressed inducibly and transiently (19Herschman H.R. Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. J. Lipid Med. 1993; 6: 89-99PubMed Google Scholar, 20DeWitt D. Meade E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Evett G.E. Xie W. Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Simmons D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the protein stabilities of the COX isoforms are different with COX-2 being more susceptible to degradation. A protein decay experiment was performed with serum-stimulated, CHX-treated NIH/3T3 cells to compare the stabilities of COX-1 and COX-2 (Fig. 1, A and B). COX-2 was degraded with a short half-life (t½) of ∼2 h, whereas COX-1 was more stable and did not appear to undergo degradation during the experiment (t½ >12 h).Although COX-2 expression is typically transient, a few tissues and cell types are reported to express COX-2 constitutively (22Shao J.

It is possible that COX-2 protein is stable under these conditions. To address this, we examined COX-2 protein degradation in LPS-stimulated murine RAW264.7 macrophage cells where COX-2 protein expression continues to increase for up to 24 h after initiating LPS treatment (41Mestre J.R.

COX-2 was also degraded rapidly (t½∼2 h) in LPS-challenged RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown), indicating that increased COX-2 protein stability is not responsible for prolonged expression of the enzyme at least in this cell type.We performed experiments with several classes of protease inhibitors to determine the pathway responsible for the selective degradation of COX-2 in NIH/3T3 cells. The 26 S proteasome inhibitors epoxomicin and MG132 (Fig. 1, C and D) significantly slowed COX-2 protein degradation at 4 and 8 h after CHX treatment, whereas two different cysteine protease inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, leupeptin (Fig. 1C) and E64 (data not shown), did not. At the 2-h time point in six independent experiments with 20 μm MG132, there was a trend but not a statistically significant inhibition (Fig. 1D). Accordingly, it is not clear whether a protease other than the 26 S proteasome can also be involved in COX-2 degradation.It should be noted that both 26 S proteasome inhibitors prevented the degradation of the two alternatively glycosylated forms (i.e. 72 and 74 kDa) of COX-2 (Fig. 1, C and D). Overall, our findings and those of others (22Shao J. Sheng H. Inoue H. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33951-33956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23Rockwell P. Yuan H. Magnusson R. Figueiredo-Pereir. M. Arch. Biochem.

Because COX-2 is located on the luminal surface of the ER (12Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19868-19875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Spencer A.G. Woods J.W.

J. Biol. Chem. 2006; : M605206200Google Scholar), our results imply that its degradation must involve transport across the ER membrane to the cytosol.The Unique C-terminal 19-amino Acid Segment of COX-2 Is Involved in COX-2 Degradation—Despite the high degree of structural similarity between the COX isoforms, COX-2 is distinct from COX-1 in possessing a unique 19-AA cassette that is located 6 residues in from the C terminus (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal-most residue of the 19-AA insert is Asn-594, which is one of four functional N-glycosylation sites of COX-2 (43Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (44Nemeth J.F. Hochgesang G.P. Marnett L.J. Caprioli R.M. Hochensang G.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3109-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); COX-1 has the other three N-glycosylation sites in common with COX-2. We used site-directed mutagenesis to test the hypothesis that the unique 19-AA segment of COX-2 affects its degradation. HEK293 cells, which do not have detectable levels of COX-1 or COX-2, were used to stably and inducibly express native or C-terminal mutant versions of the cyclooxygenase enzymes (Fig. 2B). Native human (hu) COX-2 inducibly expressed in HEK293 cells was degraded with a t½ of ∼5 h, whereas native ovine (ov) COX-1 was not degraded at a detectable rate (t½ >24 h) (Fig. 2C). A deletion mutant del595–612 huCOX-2 was prepared that lacks 18 amino acids of the 19-AA cassette segment; additionally, Asn-594 cannot be glycosylated in this mutant as the consensus N-glycosylation sequence is no longer present. This deletion mutant was stable with a t½ comparable with that of native ovCOX-1 (>24 h) (Fig. 2C). Inserting the 19-AA cassette of huCOX-2 near the C terminus of ovCOX-1 yielded a mutant ins594–612 ovCOX-1 that had a relatively short t½ of ∼3 h (Fig. 2C). Degradation of native COX-2 and of ins594–612 ovCOX-1 was retarded by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2D). These observations suggest that the 19-AA segment of COX-2 is involved in the rapid degradation of this COX isoform, perhaps by targeting it for proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome.FIGURE 2Stability of heterologously expressed native and C-terminal cyclooxygenase mutants in HEK293 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2041059768,"Mammalian cell-derived West Nile virus preferentially infects cells expressing the C-type lectin CD209L (dendritic cellspecific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin-related protein; liver- and lymph node-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin) but not cells expressing CD209 (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin). In contrast, Dengue virus infection is enhanced in cells expressing either attachment factor. The West Nile virus envelope (E) protein contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at residue 154, whereas Dengue virus E contains sites at residues 153 and 67. We introduced a glycosylation site at position 67 into West Nile virus E. Reporter virus particles pseudotyped with this E protein infected cells using either CD209 or CD209L. We also introduced glycosylation sites at several novel positions. All sites allowed CD209L-mediated infection, but only a subset promoted CD209 use. As seen for other viruses, mannose-rich glycans on West Nile virus were required for its interactions with CD209. Surprisingly, however, mannose-rich glycans were not required for CD209L-mediated infection. Complex glycans, particularly N-acetylglucosamine-terminated structures, were able to mediate reporter virus particle interactions with CD209L. We propose that CD209L recognizes glycosylated flaviviruses with broad specificity, whereas CD209 is selective for flaviviruses bearing mannose-rich glycans. The location of the N-linked glycosylation sites on a virion determines the types of glycans incorporated, thus controlling viral tropism for CD209-expressing cells. Mammalian cell-derived West Nile virus preferentially infects cells expressing the C-type lectin CD209L (dendritic cellspecific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin-related protein; liver- and lymph node-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin) but not cells expressing CD209 (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin). In contrast, Dengue virus infection is enhanced in cells expressing either attachment factor. The West Nile virus envelope (E) protein contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at residue 154, whereas Dengue virus E contains sites at residues 153 and 67. We introduced a glycosylation site at position 67 into West Nile virus E. Reporter virus particles pseudotyped with this E protein infected cells using either CD209 or CD209L. We also introduced glycosylation sites at several novel positions. All sites allowed CD209L-mediated infection, but only a subset promoted CD209 use. As seen for other viruses, mannose-rich glycans on West Nile virus were required for its interactions with CD209. Surprisingly, however, mannose-rich glycans were not required for CD209L-mediated infection. Complex glycans, particularly N-acetylglucosamine-terminated structures, were able to mediate reporter virus particle interactions with CD209L. We propose that CD209L recognizes glycosylated flaviviruses with broad specificity, whereas CD209 is selective for flaviviruses bearing mannose-rich glycans. The location of the N-linked glycosylation sites on a virion determines the types of glycans incorporated, thus controlling viral tropism for CD209-expressing cells.

Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 2Koppel E.A. van Gisbergen K.P. Geijtenbeek T.B. van Kooyk Y. Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These tetrameric type II integral membrane proteins serve as “attachment factors” that tether glycosylated virions to the cell surface (3Pohlmann S. Baribaud F. Doms R.W. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 643-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Stable attachment can result in greatly increased infection of the lectin-bearing cell or efficient transfer of bound virions to permissive target cells (4Lee B. Leslie G. Soilleux E. O'Doherty U.

A broad array of enveloped viruses is able to exploit CD209 and CD209L for increased infection in vitro. These viruses include members of the Retroviridae (human immunodeficiency virus and simian immunodeficiency virus), Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg), Flaviviridae (Dengue virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C virus), Togaviridae (Sindbis), Coronaviridae (SARS coronavirus), and Herpesviridae (human cytomegalovirus) (5Alvarez C.P.

Increased viral infection mediated by CD209 and CD209L requires interactions between these lectins and asparaginelinked viral glycans (1Geijtenbeek T.B. van Kooyk Y. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Biochemical and crystallographic studies have revealed that both lectins bind tightly to the outer branched trimannose structure common to both high mannose glycans and certain hybrid N-linked glycans (14Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 16Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Recognition occurs via an extended binding pocket that makes contacts with multiple mannose groups in this outer branch point structure, explaining the high overall affinity of the interaction (16Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Currently, mannose-rich glycans are the only reported ligands for CD209L. CD209 likewise binds tightly to these sugars but has an additional ability to bind certain bacteria and parasites bearing fucose-containing glycans such as the Lewisx antigen (15Guo Y. Feinberg H.

Little data are available regarding the importance of these well studied biochemical interactions to infections in vivo, largely due to a lack of a suitable animal model for studying these lectins (18Bashirova A.A. Wu L. Cheng J. Martin T.D. Martin M.P. Benveniste R.E. Lifson J.D. KewalRamani V.N. Hughes A. Carrington M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Park C.G.

However, laboratory and genetic studies have supported an important role for these lectins in Dengue virus (DENV) disease in humans. CD209 is expressed by macrophages and dendritic cells (21Krutzik S.R. Tan B. Li H. Ochoa M.T. Liu P.T. Sharfstein S.E. Graeber T.G. Sieling P.A. Liu Y.J. Rea T.H. Bloom B.R. Modlin R.L. Nat.

Dis. 2004; 189: 1411-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 26Wu S.J. Grouard-Vogel G. Sun W. Mascola J.R. Brachtel E. Putvatana R. Louder M.K. Filgueira L. Marovich M.A. Wong H.K.

In vitro, antibodies to CD209 prevent DENV infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (12Navarro-Sanchez E. Altmeyer R. Amara A. Schwartz O. Fieschi F. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Despres P. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 13Tassaneetrithep B. Burgess T.H. Granelli-Piperno A. Trumpfheller C. Finke J. Sun W. Eller M.A. Pattanapanyasat K.

Recently, a polymorphism in the CD209 promoter region associated with altered transcriptional activity in vitro was linked to a decreased risk of severe Dengue fever in three independent cohorts in Thailand (27Sakuntabhai A. Turbpaiboon C. Casademont I. Chuansumrit A. Lowhnoo T. Kajaste-Rudnitski A. Kalayanarooj S.M. Tangnararatchakit K. Tangthawornchaikul N. Vasanawathana S. Chaiyaratana W. Yenchitsomanus P.T.

CD209L may also be involved in DENV replication, as it is expressed by endothelial cells in the liver and lymph nodes, both of which are known sites of DENV replication in vivo (25Jessie K. Fong M.Y. Devi S. Lam S.K. Wong K.T. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 1411-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 28Rosen L. Drouet M.T. Deubel V. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1999; 61: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We recently examined the interactions of CD209 and CD209L with West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus related to DENV (6Davis C.W. Nguyen H.Y. Hanna S.L. Sanchez M.D. Doms R.W. Pierson T.C. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1290-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We observed that CD209L promoted WNV infection much more efficiently than did CD209, particularly when the virus was grown in mammalian cells. This was unexpected since CD209L is thought to bind only a subset of the carbohydrate ligands of CD209 (15Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Blixt O. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and because preferential binding of a pathogen to CD209L had not been reported previously. Additional studies using virus-like particles (reporter virus particles (RVPs)) produced by trans-complementation of a subgenomic WNV replicon with the three flavivirus structural proteins (29Pierson T.C. Sanchez M.D. Puffer B.A. Ahmed A.A. Geiss B.J. Valentine L.E. Altamura L.A. Diamond M.S. Doms R.W. Virology. 2006; 346: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 33Gehrke R. Ecker M. Aberle S.W. Allison S.L. Heinz F.X. Mandl C.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 8924-8933Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) also showed enhanced infection of CD209L-expressing cells but not CD209-expressing cells. However, RVPs made using the structural proteins of DENV were able to use either CD209 or CD209L for increased cellular infection (6Davis C.W. Nguyen H.Y. Hanna S.L. Sanchez M.D. Doms R.W. Pierson T.C. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1290-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, when produced in mammalian cells, the structural proteins of DENV, but not those of WNV, have the ability to promote CD209 utilization. DENV and WNV virions have very similar structures (34Kuhn R.J. Zhang W. Rossmann M.G. Pletnev S.V. Corver J. Lenches E. Jones C.T. Mukhopadhyay S. Chipman P.R. Strauss E.G. Baker T.S. Strauss J.H. Cell. 2002; 108: 717-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar, 35Mukhopadhyay S. Kim B.S. Chipman P.R. Rossmann M.G. Kuhn R.J. Science. 2003; 302: 248Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Their surfaces consist of a regular array of 180 envelope (E) protein subunits arranged in an icosahedral lattice (36Mukhopadhyay S. Kuhn R.J. Rossmann M.G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The small membrane (M) protein, generated following furin-mediated processing of pre-membrane protein (prM), is also present on the virion surface but is mostly buried in the viral membrane. Although it is not visualized in cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) reconstructions of flavivirus particles, some level of uncleaved prM is generally present in infectious particles (37Keelapang P. Sriburi R. Supasa S. Panyadee N. Songjaeng A. Jairungsri A. Puttikhunt C. Kasinrerk W. Malasit P. Sittisombut N. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2367-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Wengler G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2521-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it can also play a role in CD209L binding (6Davis C.W. Nguyen H.Y. Hanna S.L. Sanchez M.D. Doms R.W. Pierson T.C. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1290-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The major structural differences between DENV and WNV virions stem from the number and location of N-linked glycosylation sites in the DENV viral E proteins (35Mukhopadhyay S. Kim B.S. Chipman P.R. Rossmann M.G. Kuhn R.J. Science. 2003; 302: 248Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Most DENV isolates contain glycosylation sites at residues 67 and 153, although the site at 153 may not always be utilized (39Johnson A.J. Guirakhoo F. Roehrig J.T. Virology. 1994; 203: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, WNV E proteins only contain an N-linked glycan at asparagine 154, although this is absent in many virus strains. The presence of N-glycosylation on the WNV E protein has been linked in some studies to increased neuroinvasiveness in mice (40Beasley D.W. Whiteman M.C. Zhang S. Huang C.Y. Schneider B.S. Smith D.R. Gromowski G.D. Higgs S. Kinney R.M. Barrett A.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8339-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 44Chambers T.J. Halevy M. Nestorowicz A. Rice C.M. Lustig S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2375-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and to altered cellular tropism in vitro (45Hanna S.L. Pierson T.C. Sanchez M.D. Ahmed A.A. Murtadha M.M. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13262-13274Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the glycosylation site at residue 67 of the DENV E protein might be responsible for the ability of this virus to interact with CD209. Indeed, a recent cryo-EM study demonstrated that the isolated carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of CD209 binds preferentially to a subset of glycans present at position 67 on DENV particles (46Pokidysheva E. Zhang Y. Battisti A. Bator-Kelly C.M. Chipman P.R. Xiao C. Gregorio G.G. Hendrickson W.A. Kuhn R.J. Rossmann M.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 485-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed a series of mutant WNV E proteins containing N-linked glycosylation sites at position 67 or at several novel positions. We studied the abilities of RVPs made with these glycosylation mutants to infect CD209- or CD209L-expressing cells. We also examined the contributions of specific N-linked carbohydrates to interactions with these two lectins by treating RVPs with specific glycosidases or by manipulating carbohydrate processing in the RVP producer cells. We show that certain glycosylation locations, including position 67, allow WNV to interact with CD209. These interactions are strictly dependent on the incorporation of “mannose-rich” sugars (Man5-9 high mannose or Man5 hybrid glycans). We also show that, surprisingly, CD209L can recognize flaviviruses bearing either complex or mannose-rich glycans. Binding of CD209L to complex glycans appears to entail the recognition of particular terminal sugar moieties, particularly N-acetylglucosamine. Cells and Reagents—K562 control, K562-CD209, K562-CD209L, Vero, and BHK WNIIrep-REN cells were cultured as described previously (6Davis C.W. Nguyen H.Y. Hanna S.L. Sanchez M.D. Doms R.W. Pierson T.C. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1290-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Note that we previously referred to K562-CD209 and K562-CD209L cells as K562-SIGN and K562-SIGNR cells, respectively. Lipofectamine 2000 was obtained from Invitrogen, and Renilla luciferase substrate was purchased from Promega. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against prM were generated by ProSci (San Diego) by immunization of rabbits with peptides spanning the following three regions in prM: the N-terminal “pr” region, the furin cleavage junction, and the C-terminal “M” region. Antibodies were affinity-purified over peptide columns. Pooled antibodies from immunized rabbits were used for prM/M staining. Deoxymannojirimycin was purchased from Calbiochem. Endoglycosidase Hf (endo H) and protein N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) were purchased from New England Biolabs. A polyclonal rabbit serum against the WNV E protein was generated by immunization of rabbits with two recombinant His6-tagged thioredoxin fusion proteins containing residues 146-249 and 34-137 of the NY99 WNV E protein. β-N-Acetylhexosaminidase (HEXase I) and β(1-4)-galactosidase were purchased from Prozyme. These exoglycosidase enzymes were originally cloned from Streptococcus pneumoniae, whose glycosidase enzymes are active at neutral pH values (47Hughes R.C. Jeanloz R.W. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1535-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 48Hughes R.C. Jeanloz R.W. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is also worth noting that, unlike other commercially available β-N-acetylhexosaminidase enzymes that act upon both GlcNAc and N-acetylgalactosamine (49Robbins P.W. Overbye K. Albright C. Benfield B. Pero J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), HEXase I removes only GlcNAc residues (50Yamashita K. Ohkura T. Yoshima H. Kobata A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Plasmids—We used the following plasmids: furin expression plasmid pcDNA3.1furin (51Binley J.M. Sanders R.W. Clas B. Schuelke N. Master A. Guo Y. Kajumo F. Anselma D.J. Maddon P.J. Olson W.C. Moore J.P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar); DENV serotype 1 (Western Pacific strain) prM-E expression vector pDV1 prM-E VAX (provided by Drs. Wellington Sun and Robert Putnak); DENV serotype I capsid expression vector pDV1Cap (6Davis C.W. Nguyen H.Y. Hanna S.L. Sanchez M.D. Doms R.W. Pierson T.C. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1290-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar); and WNV lineage II capsid expression vector pWNIIcap (29Pierson T.C. Sanchez M.D. Puffer B.A. Ahmed A.A. Geiss B.J. Valentine L.E. Altamura L.A. Diamond M.S. Doms R.W. Virology. 2006; 346: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The WNV strain NY99 prM-E expression plasmid pCBWN (52Davis B.S. Chang G.J. Cropp B. Roehrig J.T. Martin D.A. Mitchell C.J. Bowen R. Bunning M.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4040-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and a derivative of this plasmid lacking the N-linked glycosylation site at E protein residue 154 (NY99-N154Q) (45Hanna S.L. Pierson T.C. Sanchez M.D. Ahmed A.A. Murtadha M.M. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13262-13274Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were used as templates for the introduction of novel N-linked glycosylation sites into the WNV E protein by site-directed mutagenesis. The following amino acid changes were introduced into NY99-N154Q: (i) Ala-54 to Thr (A54T) adds an N-linked glycosylation site at Asn-52; (ii) D67N adds a site at Asn-67; (iii) K84T adds a site at Asn-82; (iv) A173N and P174G (AP173NG) add a site at Asn-173; (v) Glu-182 to NGS (E182NGS) adds a site at Asn-182 by mutating Glu-182 to Asn and inserting two amino acids (Gly-Ser) to complete the sequon; (vi) S230N and V232T (STV230NTT) add a site at Asn-230; (vii) V279T adds a site at Asn-277; (viii) T301N and G303S (TYG301NYS) add a site at Asn-301; (ix) T330N adds a site at Asn-330; (x) K370T adds a site at Asn-368; (xi) G389N and Q391T (GEQ389NET) add a site at Asn-389. Mutants A54T, D67N, K84T, AP173NG, V279T, T330N, and K370T were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis. For mutants E182NGS, STV230NTT, TYG301NYS, and GEQ389NET, the entire mutant prM-E coding sequence was amplified by overlap-extension PCR and TOPO cloned into pcDNA3.1V5/HIS (Invitrogen). Reporter Virus Particles—3 × 106 WNV BHK WNIIrep-REN cells (containing a subgenomic WNV replicon expressing the Renilla luciferase gene) were seeded into wells of a 6-well plate. The following day, the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with 2.6 μg of pWNIIcap, 1 μg of pcDNA3.1furin, and 0.4 μg of prM-E plasmid to produce RVPs. This ratio of capsid, furin, and prM-E vectors was found to allow full conversion of prM to M and to give the highest RVP titers for all WNV prM-E mutants tested in this study (data not shown). After overnight transfection, medium was replaced with 2 ml of RVP production medium (90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, low glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), and RVP-containing supernatants were harvested and filtered with a 0.20-μm filter 48 h post-transfection. Cells, plasmids, and Lipofectamine were scaled up proportionally for larger RVP preparations. For RVPs made without furin, pcDNA3.1furin was replaced with empty pcDNA3 vector. Western Blot—1 ml of RVP-containing supernatant was pelleted through 20% sucrose by centrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 4 h in an SW 28 rotor. Virus particles were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10-20% Tris-HCl gradient gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and analyzed by Western blot with rabbit anti-prM/M polyclonal antibodies or rabbit anti-E polyclonal serum at a dilution of 1:3000. Deglycosylation of Wild-type RVPs—Freshly harvested, undiluted RVP-containing supernatants were incubated overnight at 37 °C with various glycosidases and used for infections the following day. 100 μl of RVP stock was incubated with 1 μl of water (mock treatment), 1 μl of endo H (1000 New England Biolabs (NEB) units), 1 μl of PNGase F (500 NEB units), 2 μl of HEXase I (80 Glyko milliunits), 2 μl of sialidase A (10 Glyko milliunits), or 2 μl of β(1-4)-galactosidase (4 Glyko milliunits). For PNGase F protection studies, 100 μl of RVPs were incubated for 3 h at 37°C with 1 μl of endo H or 1 μl of water, followed by addition of 1 μl of PNGase F or water, and incubation overnight at 37 °C. Deglycosylation of RVPs Containing Glycans at Novel Locations—RVPs glycosylated at position 67 had high titers and survived overnight treatment at 37 °C comparably with wildtype RVPs. Therefore, PNGase F and endo H treatment of these particles was done overnight as for wild-type particles. RVPs glycosylated at positions 182, 330, and 370 showed a dramatic loss in overall titer when incubated overnight at 37 °C in the absence of enzyme. Therefore, for these RVPs, digestion was shortened to 4 h. Time course experiments demonstrated that 4 h was sufficient for endo H treatment to exert maximal effects on RVP infectivity on K562-CD209 and K562-CD209L cells (data not shown). However, 4 h was not sufficient for maximal PNGase F activity or exoglycosidase activity. Infections—5 × 104 K562 control, -CD209, or -CD209L cells were seeded in 96-well plates and infected with RVPs diluted in K562 growth medium in a total volume of 200 μl. Cells were incubated in the presence of RVPs for 48 h followed by lysis and enumeration of luciferase activity as described previously (6Davis C.W. Nguyen H.Y. Hanna S.L. Sanchez M.D. Doms R.W.

For antibody inhibition studies, cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml mAb 120526 (for K562-CD209 cells), 10 μg/ml mAb 120604 (for K562-CD209L cells), or 10 μg/ml control mouse IgG antibody (clone DC72) before addition of RVPs diluted in medium containing the same concentration of mAb. We have demonstrated previously that mAbs 120526 and 120604 are highly effective inhibitors of WNV infection via CD209 and CD209L, respectively (6Davis C.W. Nguyen H.Y. Hanna S.L. Sanchez M.D. Doms R.W. Pierson T.C. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1290-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Inclusion of a Furin Expression Plasmid during Transfection Results in RVPs Devoid of prM—In this study, we wished to focus solely on the effect of E protein glycans on the interactions of flaviviruses with CD209 and CD209L. Immature flavivirus particles contain two envelope glycoproteins, prM and E. During particle egress, prM is cleaved by the cellular enzyme furin, releasing the glycosylated, N-terminal portion of prM from the particle and leaving behind the small, nonglycosylated membrane protein M (36Mukhopadhyay S. Kuhn R.J. Rossmann M.G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). However, furin-mediated cleavage of prM does not always go to completion for WNV, and thus virions may contain both E and prM glycans (38Wengler G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2521-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that these prM glycans may mediate interactions with CD209L, albeit less efficiently than E protein glycans (6Davis C.W. Nguyen H.Y. Hanna S.L. Sanchez M.D. Doms R.W. Pierson T.C. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1290-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To avoid prM-mediated effects in this study, we modified our normal procedure for producing WNV RVPs. When WNV replicon-containing BHK cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the flavivirus structural proteins, an expression plasmid for human furin was also included. Using an optimized ratio of the individual plasmids, this procedure resulted in the production of RVPs devoid of prM as assessed by Western blot (Fig. 1A). WNV Pseudotypes Produced in the Presence of Excess Furin Interact with CD209L but Not CD209, whereas DENV Pseudotypes Interact with Both Lectins—Using this protocol, we produced RVP stocks with the structural proteins of DENV or WNV and used these stocks to infect K562 cell lines expressing CD209, CD209L, or a control message. As we observed previously (6Davis C.W. Nguyen H.Y. Hanna S.L. Sanchez M.D. Doms R.W. Pierson T.C. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1290-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), RVPs pseudotyped with the DENV structural proteins infected both K562-CD209 and K562-CD209L cells much more efficiently than control cells (Fig. 1B), whereas WNV-pseudotyped RVPs showed a strong preference for infecting K562-CD209L cells over K562-CD209 or control cells (Fig. 1C). RVPs made with a “glycosylation knock-out” WNV E protein lacking the single N-linked glycosylation site at residue 154 infected all three K562 lines with equally low efficiency (Fig. 1D), confirming that RVPs made using our optimized transfection procedure require E protein glycosylation to interact with CD209 or CD209L. Addition of an N-Linked Glycosylation Site to Position 67 of the WNV E Protein Allows CD209 Utilization—We next investigated whether the N-linked glycosylation site at position 67 in the DENV E protein could explain why DENV-pseudotyped RVPs were able to infect CD209-expressing cells efficiently, whereas WNV-pseudotyped RVPs were not. We added an N-linked site at position 67 to both the wild-type WNV E protein and the glycosylation knock-out E protein. This resulted in mutant proteins containing N-linked glycans at both residues 67 and 154 or solely at residue 67. Pseudotyped RVPs made with either of these mutants infected both K562-CD209 and K562-CD209L cells more efficiently than controls (Fig. 1, E and F). This suggests that glycosylation at position 67 is sufficient to allow a WNV virion to interact with either CD209 or CD209L. Infection of K562-CD209 cells was somewhat more efficient for RVPs containing glycans at both position 67 and position 154 than for RVPs glycosylated only at position 67. This difference suggests that glycosylation at residue 154 may increase the efficiency of CD209 usage when the glycan at position 67 is also present. Removal of Mannose-rich Glycans from RVPs by Endoglycosidase H Blocks Their Interactions with CD209 but Not CD209L—CD209 and CD209L are both known to bind strongly to high mannose N-linked glycan"

https://openalex.org/W2073986458,"Mutational activation of BRAF is a frequent event in human malignant melanomas suggesting that BRAF-dependent signaling is conducive to melanoma cell growth and survival. Previously published work reported that melanoma cells exhibit constitutive anti-apoptotic nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor activation triggered by proteolysis of its inhibitor IkappaB. IkappaB degradation is dependent upon its phosphorylation by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and subsequent ubiquitination facilitated by beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we report that melanocytes expressing a conditionally oncogenic form of BRAF(V600E) exhibit enhanced beta-Trcp expression, increased IKK activity and a concomitant increase in the rate of IkappaBalpha degradation. Conversely, inhibition of BRAF signaling using either a broad-spectrum Raf inhibitor (BAY 43-9006) or by selective knock-down of BRAF(V600E) expression by RNA interference in human melanoma cells leads to decreased IKK activity and beta-Trcp expression, stabilization of IkappaB, inhibition of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and sensitization of these cells to apoptosis. Taken together, these data support a model in which mutational activation of BRAF in human melanomas contributes to constitutive induction of NF-kappaB activity and to increased survival of melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1982830152,"PII proteins are widespread and highly conserved signal transduction proteins occurring in bacteria, Archaea, and plants and play pivotal roles in controlling nitrogen assimilatory metabolism. This study reports on biochemical properties of the PII-homologue GlnK (originally termed NrgB) in Bacillus subtilis (BsGlnK). Like other PII proteins, the native BsGlnK protein has a trimeric structure and readily binds ATP in the absence of divalent cations, whereas 2-oxoglutarate is only weakly bound. In contrast to other PII-like proteins, Mg2+ severely affects its ATP-binding properties. BsGlnK forms a tight complex with the membrane-bound ammonium transporter AmtB (NrgA), from which it can be relieved by millimolar concentrations of ATP. Immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments identified a novel interaction between the BsGlnK-AmtB complex and the major transcription factor of nitrogen metabolism, TnrA. In vitro in the absence of ATP, TnrA is completely tethered to membrane (AmtB)-bound GlnK, whereas in extracts from BsGlnK- or AmtB-deficient cells, TnrA is entirely soluble. The presence of 4 mm ATP leads to concomitant solubilization of BsGlnK and TnrA. This ATP-dependent membrane re-localization of TnrA by BsGlnK/AmtB may present a novel mechanism to control the global nitrogen-responsive transcription regulator TnrA in B. subtilis under certain physiological conditions.

Most bacteria are able to assimilate nitrogen from simple organic and/or anorganic nitrogen compounds. The utilization of the various sources as well as the activity of the nitrogen assimilatory enzymes is strictly regulated in almost all bacteria. Proteins of the PII family, consisting of the subfamilies GlnB, GlnK and NifI, are central players in sensing and transmitting signals of the cellular nitrogen status (reviewed in Ref. 1Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). They are among the most highly conserved and widely distributed signal transducers occurring in bacteria (1Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), Archaea (2Kessler P.S. Daniel C. Leigh J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 882-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Ehlers C. Weidenbach K. Veit K. Forchhammer K. Schmitz R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1841-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as well as in the chloroplasts of eukaryotic algae and plants (4Moorhead G.B.G. Smith C.S. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1-7Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The GlnK subfamily proteins are encoded by genes arranged in conjunction with genes encoding the ammonium permease AmtB (1Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).The trimeric PII proteins may bind up to three ATP and three 2-oxoglutarate molecules, which are the effectors of PII signaling (5Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding sites were resolved by crystallographic analysis and were shown to be located in the lateral clefts between the subunits (6Xu Y. Chea E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H. Vasudevan S.G. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Binding of ATP and 2-oxoglutarate to PII proteins mutually depends on each other (7Kamberov E.S. Atkinson M.A. Ninfa A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17797-17807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Forchhammer K. Hedler A. Eur. J.

Plant J. 2003; 33: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the γ-phosphate of ATP was shown to be crucial for this interaction (10Benelli E.M. Buck M. Polikarpov I. de Souza E.M. Cruz L.M. Pedrosa F.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3296-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Ruppert U. Irmler A. Kloft N. Forchhammer K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition to binding ligands, PII-like proteins may be subjected to covalent modification in response to changes in the nitrogen availability. In all cases investigated so far, this modification occurs at an amino acid, which is located near the apex of a large, surface-exposed loop (T-loop) (6Xu Y. Chea E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H. Vasudevan S.G. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Different kinds of covalent modification have been identified in diverse organisms. In enteric bacteria, PII proteins are uridylylated at the tyrosyl residue 51 (5Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the actinobacteria this tyrosyl residue is adenylylated (12Hesketh A. Fink D. Gust B. Rexer H.U. Scheel B. Chater K. Wohlleben W. Engels A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Strösser J. Lüdke A. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Burkovski A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By contrast, PII in cyanobacteria may be phosphorylated at seryl residue 49 (14Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in some organisms the PII-like proteins seem not to be modified, such as in cyanobacteria of the genus Prochlorococcus (15Palinska K.A. Laloui W. Bedu S. Loiseaux-de Goer S. Castets A.M. Rippka R. Tandeau de Marsac N. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2405-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or in plants (16Smith C.S. Morrice N.A. Moorhead G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Depending on their states of ligand binding and modification, PII proteins control key processes in nitrogen assimilation through binding to receptor proteins. For example, GlnB in Escherichia coli controls the activity of the transcription factor NtrC via interaction with the histidine kinase NtrB and regulates the activity of the glutamine synthetase (GS) 2The abbreviations used are: GS, glutamine synthetase; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; TOF, time of flight; SMM, Spizizen minimal medium; 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; ESI, electrospray ionization. 2The abbreviations used are: GS, glutamine synthetase; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; TOF, time of flight; SMM, Spizizen minimal medium; 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; ESI, electrospray ionization. through its interaction with the GS-modifying enzyme adenylyltransferase (5Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17Reitzer L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PII proteins may interact with the regulatory proteins NifA or NifL in nitrogen-fixing bacteria (18Dixon R. Kahn D. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) or in the archaeal Methanococcus maripaludis the PII-like NifI protein directly interacts with dinitrogenase (19Dodsworth J.A. Leigh J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9779-9784Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria and plants, PII regulates the key enzyme of arginine biosynthesis, N-acetylglutamate kinase, by complex formation (20Maheswaran M. Urbanke C. Forchhammer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 53: 55202-55210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The PII-paralogue GlnK controls ammonium transport by direct interaction with the high affinity transporter AmtB (21Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recently, it could be demonstrated that AmtB-bound PII is able to sequester the regulatory enzyme dinitrogenase reductase glycohydrolase (DraG) to the membrane following ammonium shock (22Huergo L.F. Souza E.M. Araujo M.S. Pedrosa F.O. Chubatsu L.S. Steffens M.B.R. Merrick M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).In the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation in response to the nitrogen regime involves other factors than those identified in proteobacteria, corynebacteria, or cyanobacteria. Two different transcription factors, GlnR and TnrA, are involved in transcriptional nitrogen control and in the response to the cellular nitrogen status (for review, see Ref. 23Fisher S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Both transcriptional regulators belong to the MerR family of DNA-binding regulatory proteins (24Schreier H.J. Brown S.W. Hirschi K.D. Nomellini J.F. Sonenshein A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Wray L.V. Ferson Jr., A.E. Rohrer K. Fisher S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8841-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). GlnR represses gene expression under nitrogen excess conditions. There are only three known targets for GlnR in the B. subtilis genome, the glnRA operon, consisting of its own and the glutamine synthetase gene (25Wray L.V. Ferson Jr., A.E. Rohrer K. Fisher S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8841-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the tnrA gene (26Fisher S.H. Wray L.V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4636-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and the ureABC operon, encoding urease (27Wray L.V. Ferson Jr., A.E. Fisher S.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5494-5501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, TnrA activates gene expression under nitrogen-limiting conditions, in particular the genes for ammonium uptake (amtBglnK, originally termed nrgAnrgB; see Ref. 28Wray L.V. Atkinson Jr., M.R. Fisher S.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 108-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for assimilatory nitrate reduction (nasDEF; see Ref. 29Nakano M.M. Hoffmann T. Zhu Y. Jahn D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5344-5350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its own gene (tnrA; see Ref. 23Fisher S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and other genes of nitrogen assimilation (30Yoshida K. Yamaguchi H. Kinehara M. Ohki Y. Nakaura Y. Fujita Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, TnrA acts as a repressor for the genes gltAB and glnRA (31Belitsky B.R. Wray L.V. Fisher Jr., S.H. Bohannon D.E. Sonenshein A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5939-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as some other genes (30Yoshida K. Yamaguchi H. Kinehara M. Ohki Y. Nakaura Y. Fujita Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Concerning the mechanism of control of TnrA activity, it could be shown that feedback-inhibited GS directly interacts with TnrA and blocks its DNA binding activity under conditions of good ammonium supply (32Wray L.V. Zalieckas Jr., J.M. Fisher S.H. Cell. 2001; 107: 427-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Compared with other bacterial systems, the only conserved nitrogen regulatory factor in B. subtilis is a homologue of the PII family. It belongs to the GlnK subfamily (BsGlnK), based on the fact that its gene forms an operon with an amtB homologue (28Wray L.V. Atkinson Jr., M.R. Fisher S.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 108-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BsGlnK protein differs from other PII proteins by the lack of potential modification sites in the T-loop (Ser-49 or Tyr-51). Indeed, it has been suggested that BsGlnK might not be modified by covalent modification (28Wray L.V. Atkinson Jr., M.R. Fisher S.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 108-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Detsch C. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, BsGlnK was shown to bind to the cytoplasmic membrane in an AmtB-dependent manner (33Detsch C. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that it regulates the ammonium transporter like other GlnK-proteins do (13Strösser J. Lüdke A. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Burkovski A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).Taking into consideration the apparent unique properties of nitrogen control mechanisms in B. subtilis (23Fisher S.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the function of PII signaling in this organism was poorly understood. This work aimed at the elucidation of the signaling properties of PII in B. subtilis by characterizing its biochemical properties and by identifying potential interaction partners. During our studies, we identified interaction of the transcriptional regulator TnrA with GlnK and characterized its dependence on GlnK-AmtB complex formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—B. subtilis strains used in this study, strain 168 (wild type), the AmtB-deficient strain GP254, and BsGlnK-deficient mutant GP 253, were described previously (33Detsch C. Stülke J. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). E. coli strains XL1 and BL21(DE3) (34Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) were used for cloning experiments and protein expression, respectively. B. subtilis was grown in Spizizen minimal medium (SMM) (35Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing glucose (0.5% (w/v)) as carbon source. Sources of nitrogen were added as indicated. Tryptophan was added to a final concentration of 50 mg liter–1. E. coli was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, and transformants were selected on plates containing ampicillin (100 μg ml–1). LB plates were prepared by addition of 15 g of agar-agar (Carl Roth) per liter of medium.DNA Methods—DNA isolation, restriction analysis, and cloning procedures were performed according to standard procedures (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs or MBI Fermentas; oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotec. DNA sequence analysis was performed on an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Overproduction and Purification of Proteins BsGlnK, BsGlnK-ST, TnrA, and GS-ST—Construction of plasmids for overproduction of proteins used in this study and detailed purification protocols are given in the Supplemental Material.ATP Binding to BsGlnK—Determination of ATP binding in the presence or absence of 2-oxoglutarate was initially performed by the ultrafiltration method described previously (8Forchhammer K. Hedler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) or [8-14C]ADP (Moravek Biochemicals, Inc.) to BsGlnK was carried out as described (20Maheswaran M. Urbanke C. Forchhammer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 53: 55202-55210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7.5 μgof BsGlnK was incubated in 25 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin with [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi/100 μm) or [8-14C]ADP (0.05 μCi/50 μm) in the presence or absence of divalent cations and various amounts of 2-oxoglutarate as indicated. After 10 min on ice in the dark, the samples were exposed for 20 min to UV light (UV-lamp 254 nm, 4 watts; Heraeus) at a distance of 1 cm. The samples were then mixed with 9 μl of 4× SDS-loading buffer, heated for 4 min to 95 °C, and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250, dried, and exposed to phosphor-screens (Bio-Rad) for 72 h in the case of 32P labeling and for 1 week in the case of 14C labeling. The phosphor-screens were scanned with the PhosphorImager system (Personal Imager FX; Bio-Rad) at 200 μm resolution.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC experiments were performed on a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, LLC) in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl at 30 °C with BsGlnK (72–78 μm monomer concentration) in the cell (cell volume = 1.4285 ml) and ATP (2 mm) or 2-oxoglutarate (20 mm) in the syringe. Depending on the experiment, ATP or 2-oxoglutarate was titrated into BsGlnK by injecting 100 times 2 μl or 50 times 4 μl, respectively, with stirring at 450 rpm. Data for ATP binding to BsGlnK were fitted to a single site binding equation as well as to a model assuming three independent binding sites using the MicroCal ORIGIN software.Immunoblot Analysis—Purified nontagged BsGlnK (550 μg) and TnrA (250 μg) and Strep-tagged GS (630 μg) were used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (Pineda Antikörper-Service). For immunoblot analysis, B. subtilis cell-free extracts were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry electroblotting. Antibodies were visualized by using anti-rabbit IgG-POD secondary antibodies (Sigma) and the LumiLight detection system (Roche Diagnostics). For control experiments, the presence of GS was assayed using polyclonal antibodies directed against B. subtilis GS.Nondenaturing PAGE Analysis of BsGlnK—To reveal a possible modification of BsGlnK, the electrophoretic mobility of the native BsGlnK protein was determined as described previously by immunoblot analysis of nondenaturing gels (37Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J.

Cells were harvested at late exponential phase of growth at an OD600 of about 0.8 by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 500 μl of disruption buffer A and broken in the RiboLyser (Hybaid). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (3,500 × g, 2 min, 4 °C), and the fractions of the cell-free extract were separated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The supernatant was divided into equal parts in an upper (S1) and a lower (S2) fraction. The sediment (P1) was resuspended in the initial volume of buffer A, and a part of P1 was centrifuged again as before. The supernatant was fractionated once more in an equal upper (S3) and lower (S4) part, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A in the same volume of P1 as it was used for the second centrifugation step. The fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against BsGlnK or TnrA, respectively. GS-specific antibodies were used as a control.Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitation experiments, cultures of B. subtilis were grown in SMM with 20 mm NaNO3 to an OD600 of 1.5 by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer I (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 100 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm benzamidine), and broken by using the RiboLyser. After centrifugation (3,500 × g, 2 min, 4 °C) to remove debris and unbroken cells, the supernatant was subjected to a 1-h ultracentrifugation step (100,000 × g, 4 ° C). The pellet was washed once with buffer I and finally resuspended in the same buffer. 1.5 mg of the total protein amount of the cellular fractions was used for immunoprecipitation. The extracts were diluted with detergent-containing buffer (NET buffer I: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to a total volume of 1.5 ml, and following a 15-min incubation at 24 °C, the sample was briefly centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 30 s) to remove debris. After addition of 20 μl of polyclonal antibodies against GlnK or TnrA, respectively, and a 1-h incubation at 24 °C, 20 μl of protein A-agarose was added. An incubation of 1 h at 4°C followed. After centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 30 s, 4 °C), the sediment was washed twice with NET buffer I, once with NET buffer II (NET buffer I with 500 mm NaCl), and once with buffer IP (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The immunoprecipitations were analyzed both by immunoblot analysis and by Coomassie Blue G-250 staining of the gels.Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS)—MALDI-TOF-MS was carried out in cooperation with the Department of Analytic Chemistry (D. Kirsch, University of Giessen). Coomassie Blue-stained spots were isolated from the SDS gel, and the excised gel pieces were destained for 20 min at 30 °C with 500 μl of 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, in 50% acetonitrile under permanent shaking. Digestion buffer D (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 10% (v/v) acetonitrile) was added, and after 30 min at 30 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the gel pieces were dried under vacuum to 20% of the initial gel volume in a speedvac concentrator (Savant). Tryptic in-gel digestion was started after addition of 12.5 ng/μl (375 ng) trypsin (sequence grade, Promega) in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm acetonitrile, and 6 mm acetic acid. The gel pieces were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The digestion was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 75% (v/v) acetonitrile and 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and the tryptic peptides were eluted and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS using an ALADIM II mass spectrometer (constructed by the Department of Analytic Chemistry, University of Giessen) equipped with an N2-UV laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse length) and a two-stage reflector. External mass calibration was performed close to each sample spot using calibration mixtures. The search criteria for the received molecular masses were set to a mass accuracy of ±0.15 Da and preferably none (maximum of one) mis-cleaved peptides per protein. Proteins were considered as identified when more than 30% of the amino acid sequence was covered by the identified peptides and four or more peptides matched the search criteria.RESULTSPurification of BsGlnK and BsGlnK-ST and Determination of the Molecular Weight—The B. subtilis glnK (nrgB) gene was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE), and the resulting BsGlnK was purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity (see Supplemental Material). The purified protein was used for determination of native molecular weight as well as for the production of antibodies. The size of the native BsGlnK was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration experiments on a Superdex 200 column (see Supplemental Material), revealing an apparent size of about 34 kDa. With a subunit size of 12.68 kDa, calculated from the glnK coding sequence, this is consistent with a trimeric structure of BsGlnK.Binding of [32P]ATP or [14C]ADP to BsGlnK—Based on the highly conserved amino acid sequence and subunit composition, binding of ATP and 2-oxoglutarate was suggested as a common property of proteins of the PII family (5Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7Kamberov E.S. Atkinson M.A. Ninfa A.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 244: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Initial attempts to detect ATP binding of BsGlnK by using the buffer conditions (including MgCl2) and the ultrafiltration procedure that was used to measure ATP binding of E. coli and Synechocococcus elongatus PII proteins (7Kamberov E.S. Atkinson M.A. Ninfa A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17797-17807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Forchhammer K. Hedler A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) failed to reveal binding. Therefore, ATP binding at higher ligand concentrations and with different buffer conditions was tried using UV photolabeling experiments with [32P]ATP or [14C]ADP, a method that was successfully employed previously (20Maheswaran M. Urbanke C. Forchhammer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 53: 55202-55210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, an appreciable amount of ATP binding to BsGlnK could be detected in the absence of divalent cations, and binding was slightly enhanced in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate. In the presence of 2 mm MgCl2, the amount of [32P]ATP that bound to BsGlnK was strongly reduced. However, 2-oxoglutarate partially rescued ATP binding to BsGlnK. By contrast, in the presence of 2 mm MnCl2, ATP binding was not affected by 2-oxoglutarate. Binding analysis using [14C]ADP revealed no detectable photoaffinity labeling (data not shown).To gain further insights into the ligand binding properties of BsGlnK, ITC experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, BsGlnK exhibits high affinity toward ATP in the absence of Mg2+ ions, irrespective of the absence or presence of 2-oxoglutarate. When the data are fitted according to a model assuming three independent binding sites, the Kd value for ATP binding by BsGlnK is about 17.3 μm in the absence and 20.3 μm in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate, with a respective stoichiometry of 2.07 or 2.1 per PII trimer. According to a binding model assuming three sequential bindings, all three sites may be occupied, irrespective of the presence or absence of 2-oxoglutarate (data not shown). In contrast to ATP, 2-oxoglutarate is bound much less strongly (Fig. 2C) with an estimated dissociation constant in the millimolar range, and its binding is apparently not affected by ATP (not shown). As already observed by UV cross-linking, the presence of MgCl2 strongly affected ATP binding. In the presence of 1 mm MgCl2, addition of ATP did not yield calorimetric signals, neither in the absence (Fig. 2D) nor in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate (not shown). Experiments with submillimolar concentrations of MgCl2 showed that already 0.1 mm MgCl2 strongly reduced the signals detected by ITC. In the presence of 0.1 mm MgCl2, 2-oxoglutarate favored ATP binding (compare Fig. 2, E and F). Fitting these data according to a model assuming three sequential binding sites, one site would be occupied in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate, whereas three sites may be occupied in its presence. Calculating the thermodynamic constants for ATP binding in the absence of Mg2+ ions results in a ΔH of –11,070 cal/mol, a ΔS of –14.7, and a ΔG of –6.61 kcal/mol, whereas in the presence of 0.1 mm Mg2+ ions, the apparent values indicate a ΔH of –2284 cal/mol, a ΔS of +16.9, and a ΔG of –7.41 kcal/mol. This suggests that Mg2+ ions strongly affect the enthalpy (ΔH) of the reaction, whereas the entropy (ΔS) rises. Thus, ATP binding in the presence of Mg2+ ions might cause conformational changes, which consume the free energy and increase the entropy. Together, these data show that the ligand binding properties of BsGlnK, albeit principally conserved, are quite distinct from that of other PII proteins characterized so far, most notably, the strongly reduced affinity toward ATP in the presence of Mg2+ ions.FIGURE 2ITC. ATP (2 mm in the syringe) was injected (100 times 2 μl) into 78 μm BsGlnK in the absence (A) and in the presence (B) of 1 mm 2-oxoglutarate. In the absence of Mg2+, ATP binds strongly to BsGlnK exhibiting nearly similar dissociation constants of Kd = 17.3 μm (absence of 2-oxoglutarate, 2-OG) or Kd = 20.3 μm (presence of 2-OG), respectively. C, 2-OG (20 mm in the syringe, 50 times 4-μl injections) itself is bound only weakly by BsGlnK, irrespective of"
https://openalex.org/W1991335880,"Cell migration and angiogenesis are key steps in tumor metastasis. However, the mechanism of migration regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent regulator of angiogenesis, is not completely understood. This study examined the relationship between VEGF and migration, along with the mechanism involved in the VEGF-regulated migration of human gastric cancer cells. The level of cell migration was increased by recombinant human (rh)VEGF-165 in the VEGF receptor-2-expressing SNU-601 cells. Interleukin (IL)-18 is associated with the malignant progression of tumors. Accordingly, this study examined the effect of IL-18 on the migration of cancer cells in order to identify the factors involved in VEGF-enhanced migration. Inhibiting IL-18 markedly reduced the level of VEGF-enhanced migration, and IL-18 increased cell migration directly through filamentous-actin polymerization and tensin downregulation. It was confirmed that rhVEGF-165 increased IL-18 production significantly. An antioxidant and an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2-specific inhibitor blocked rhVEGF-165-enhanced IL-18 production. Accordingly, rhVEGF-165 increased the generation of region of interest (ROI) and activated the ERK1/2 pathway. These results suggest that rhVEGF-165 enhances IL-18 production via the generation of ROI and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which results in the increased migration of gastric cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980499191,"DNA-hypermethylation of SOCS genes in breast, ovarian, squamous cell and hepatocellular carcinoma has led to speculation that silencing of SOCS1 and SOCS3 genes might promote oncogenic transformation of epithelial tissues. To examine whether transcriptional silencing of SOCS genes is a common feature of human carcinoma, we have investigated regulation of SOCS genes expression by IFNγ, IGF-1 and ionizing radiation, in a normal human mammary epithelial cell line (AG11134), two breast-cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HCC1937) and three prostate cancer cell lines. Compared to normal breast cells, we observe a high level constitutive expression of SOCS2, SOCS3, SOCS5, SOCS6, SOCS7, CIS and/or SOCS1 genes in the human cancer cells. In MCF-7 and HCC1937 breast-cancer cells, transcription of SOCS1 is dramatically up-regulated by IFNγ and/or ionizing-radiation while SOCS3 is transiently down-regulated by IFNγ and IGF-1, suggesting that SOCS genes are not silenced in these cells by the epigenetic mechanism of DNA-hypermethylation. We further show that the kinetics of SOCS1-mediated feedback inhibition of IFNγ signaling is comparable to normal breast cells, indicating that the SOCS1 protein in breast-cancer cells is functional. We provide direct evidence that STAT3 pathways are constitutively activated in MCF-7 and HCC1937 cells and may drive the aberrant persistent activation of SOCS genes in breast-cancer cells. Our data therefore suggest that elevated expression of SOCS genes is a specific lesion of breast-cancer cells that may confer resistance to proinflammatory cytokines and trophic factors, by shutting down STAT1/STAT5 signaling that mediate essential functions in the mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W1986856373,"We have shown that one of the principle mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance involves the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). In an effort to identify NF-κB-regulated chemotherapy response genes, we performed a microarray assay and observed that heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) was significantly upregulated by SN38 (a strong inducer of NF-κB activity) in colon cancer cells. Further studies revealed that HB-EGF was rapidly induced following a variety of chemotherapy treatments. Using RNA interference, we demonstrated that the chemotherapy-induced HB-EGF was largely dependent on activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB activation. Constitutive HB-EGF expression rescued AP-1/NF-κB small interfering RNA (siRNA) cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, we found that the enzymatic shedding of HB-EGF was also regulated by chemotherapy treatment, resulting in the elevated release of soluble HB-EGF from the cellular membrane. Induction of HB-EGF expression and ectodomain shedding synergistically led to robust epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of HB-EGF expression by use of the HB-EGF inhibitor (CRM197) or siRNA resulted in the suppression of chemotherapy-induced EGFR phosphorylation. These results suggest that the chemotherapy-induced EGFR activation is regulated by HB-EGF. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpression of HB-EGF led to apoptotic resistance to chemotherapy, whereas suppression of HB-EGF expression by siRNA resulted in a dramatic increase in cell death. In summary, our study suggests that chemotherapy-induced HB-EGF activation represents a critical mechanism of inducible chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, therapeutic intervention aimed at inhibiting HB-EGF activity may be useful in cancer prevention and treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2051328830,"The shikimate pathway, including seven enzymatic steps for production of chorismate via shikimate from phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate, is common in various organisms for the biosynthesis of not only aromatic amino acids but also most biogenic benzene derivatives. 3-Amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-AHBA) is a benzene derivative serving as a precursor for several secondary metabolites produced by Streptomyces, including grixazone produced by Streptomyces griseus. Our study on the biosynthesis pathway of grixazone led to identification of the biosynthesis pathway of 3,4-AHBA from two primary metabolites. Two genes, griI and griH, within the grixazone biosynthesis gene cluster were found to be responsible for the biosynthesis of 3,4-AHBA; the two genes conferred the in vivo production of 3,4-AHBA even on Escherichia coli. In vitro analysis showed that GriI catalyzed aldol condensation between two primary metabolites, l-aspartate-4-semialdehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, to form a 7-carbon product, 2-amino-4,5-dihydroxy-6-one-heptanoic acid-7-phosphate, which was subsequently converted to 3,4-AHBA by GriH. The latter reaction required Mn2+ ion but not any cofactors involved in reduction or oxidation. This pathway is independent of the shikimate pathway, representing a novel, simple enzyme system responsible for the synthesis of a benzene ring from the C3 and C4 primary metabolites."

These Cl− channels play a central role in diseases such as secretory diarrhea, polycystic kidney disease, and cystic fibrosis. The family of bestrophins has been suggested to form calcium-activated Cl− channels. Here, we demonstrate molecular and functional expression of bestrophin-1 (BEST1) in mouse and human airways, colon, and kidney. Endogenous calcium-activated whole cell Cl− currents coincide with endogenous expression of the Vmd2 gene product BEST1 in murine and human epithelial cells, whereas calcium-activated Cl− currents are absent in epithelial tissues lacking BEST1 expression.

Although this type of channel has been studied extensively, the molecular identity of CaCC in epithelial tissues remains a mystery (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol.

These proteins are involved not only in chloride conductance and epithelial secretion but also in cell-cell adhesion, apoptosis, and cell cycle control. However, detailed structure-function analysis is still missing, and these proteins have a surprisingly low Ca2+ sensitivity (1Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol.

For the first time, we will provide evidence that endogenously expressed BEST1 causes Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance in epithelial tissues. Mice (C57BL/6, Charles Rivers Laboratories) were killed under CO2 narcosis by cervical dislocation. Tissues were put immediately into an ice-cold buffer solution containing 145 mmol/liter NaCl, 3.8 mmol/liter KCl, 5 mmol/liter d-glucose, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5 mmol/liter HEPES, and 1.3 mmol/liter calcium gluconate (pH 7.4). After mounting into a perfused micro-Ussing chamber, apical and basolateral surfaces of the epithelium were perfused continuously with buffer solution at a rate of 5–10 ml/min (chamber volume of 2 ml). All experiments were carried out at 37 °C under open circuit conditions. Transepithelial resistance (Rte) was determined by applying short (1 s) current pulses (I = 0.5 μA), and the corresponding changes in transepithelial voltage (Vte) and basal Vte were recorded continuously. Vte values refer to the serosal side of the epithelium. The equivalent short circuit current (Isc) was calculated according to Ohm's law from Vte and Rte (Isc = Vte/Rte). Cell culture dishes were mounted on the stage of a Zeiss IM35 inverted microscope and kept at 37 °C. The bath was perfused continuously with Ringer's solution at ∼10 ml/min. Patch clamp experiments were performed in the fast whole cell configuration. Patch pipettes had an input resistance of 2–4 megaohms when filled with a solution containing 30 mm KCl, 95 mm potassium gluconate, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 4.8 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.758 mm calcium gluconate, 1.034 mm MgCl2, 5 mm d-glucose, and 3 mm ATP. The pH was 7.2, and the Ca2+ activity was 0.1 μm. The access conductance was measured continuously and was 60–140 nanosiemens. Currents (voltage clamp) and voltages (current clamp) were recorded using a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7, List Medical Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany), an LH1600 interface and PULSE software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany), and Chart software (ADInstruments, Spechbach, Germany). Data were stored continuously on a computer hard disc and analyzed using PULSE software. In regular intervals, membrane voltages (Vc) were clamped in steps of 10 mV from −50 to +50 mV relative to the resting potential. Membrane conductance (Gm) was calculated from the measured current (I) and Vc values according to Ohm's law. Total RNA was isolated from freshly isolated tissues and cell lines studied using NucleoSpin RNA II columns (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). After reverse transcription of total RNA (Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, Promega, Mannheim, Germany), reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to detect expression of mRNAs for bestrophins.

Oligonucleotide primers for both human β-actin (ACTB, NM_001101) and mouse β-actin (Actb, NM_007393) were designed: 5′-CAACGGCTCCGGCATGTG-3′, 5′-GTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAGC-3′, 576 bp. PCRs were performed at 94 °C for 2 min, for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and at annealing temperatures of 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were visualized by loading onto agarose gels and were verified by sequencing. Duplexes of 25 nucleotides of small interfering RNA (siRNA) were designed and synthesized by Invitrogen. The sense strand of the siRNA used to silence the VMD2 gene was 5′-UGUCCCUGUUGGCUGUGGAUGAGAU-3′, corresponding to position 1038 of the VMD2 mRNA relative to the start codon. A scrambled sequence siRNA double-stranded oligomer not homologous to any known gene (BLOCK-iTTM fluorescent oligonucleotide) served as a control. Transfection of HT29, T84, and 16HBE cells was carried out 1 day after seeding (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I. After 24–48 h, cells were used for patch clamping and protein isolation. pRK5 vector carrying cDNA for human BEST1 was kindly provided by Dr. Hugh Cahill (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The plasmid was cotransfected (Lipofectamine 2000) in Opti-MEM I into HEK293 cells together with pEGFP-1 (Clontech) at a ratio of 10:1. One day after transfection, the cells were replated on 4-cm2 glass coverslips. Transfected cells were identified by enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fluorescence and used for patch clamp experiments within 3 days. Affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum were produced in rabbits immunized with the peptide carrying either mouse BEST1 (AESYPYRDEAGTKPVLYE) or human BEST1 (KDHMDPYWALENRDEAHS) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Davids Biotechnologie, Regensburg, Germany). Tissues were fixed for 2 h with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Tracheas and colons were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded tissues were cut at 4 μm on a rotary microtome (RM 2165, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were dewaxed and rehydrated. In tracheal sections, endogenous peroxide activity was eliminated by incubation in methanol with 3% H2O2 for 20 min. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-mouse bestrophin-1 antibodies diluted 1:10,000 in Tris buffer containing Triton X-100 (0.8%) and goat serum to prevent nonspecific binding. Subsequently, sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and the ABC (avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex) technique was used to visualize labeling with 3,3-diaminobenzidine. The ABC technique involves application of a biotin-labeled secondary antibody, followed by the addition of an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (17Greenberg N.M. DeMayo F. Finegold M.J. Medina D. Tilley W.D. Aspinall J.O. Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Matusik R.J. Rosen J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 3439-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Protein was isolated from mouse nose, trachea, and kidney epithelium and from cultured cells using buffer containing 150 mmol of NaCl, 50 mmol of Tris, 100 mmol of dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Equal amounts of total protein (20 μg) were separated on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), which was blocked with 3% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 (0.1%) buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with a rabbit anti-mouse or rabbit anti-human BEST1 antibody (1:5000) overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were visualized using a horseradish peroxide-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:30,000; Acris Antibodies GmbH, Hiddenhausen, Germany) and an ECL Advance Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Signal detection was done using a Fluor-STM MultiImager system (Bio-Rad). 9HTE and 16HBE-14o cells (bronchial epithelium; kindly provided by Prof. D. Gruenert, California Pacific Medical Research Institute, San Francisco), Calu-3 cells (pulmonary adenocarcinoma), H441 cells (lung adenocarcinoma; kindly provided by Dr. S. Wilson, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom), HT29 cells (colorectal carcinoma epithelial), T84 cells (colorectal carcinoma), and M1 cells (mouse collecting duct; kindly provided by C. Korbmacher, Physiologisches Institut, Universität Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1). HEK293 cells (embryonic kidney; kindly provided by Dr. Ralph Witzgall, Institute of Anatomy, University of Regensburg) and 9HTE/16HBE cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and minimum Eagle's medium, respectively. H441 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. All media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Media were substituted with 2 mm glutamine (Calu-3, H441, T84, and 9HTE), 20 mg/ml galactose (HT29), 10 mm HEPES (Calu-3), and 10 μg/ml insulin, 5.5 μg/ml transferrin, 6.7 μg/ml selenium, and 0.1 μm dexamethasone (H441 and M1). Cells were seeded on plastic dishes or glass coverslips coated with bovine plasma fibronectin (Invitrogen) and bovine dermal collagen (Cellon, Bereldange, Luxembourg). All compounds used were of the highest available grade of purity and were from Sigma or Merck. All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Student's t test (for paired or unpaired samples as appropriate) and analysis of variance were used for statistical analysis. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. In mouse trachea, stimulation of luminal purinergic P2Y receptors by ATP (100 μm) increases intracellular Ca2+ and stimulates Cl− secretion (18Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Mall M. Gonska T. Thomas J. Schreiber R. Seydewitz H.H. Kuehr J. Brandis M. Kunzelmann K. Pediatr. Res. 2003; 53: 608-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ATP induced a negative voltage deflection in Ussing chamber experiments and activated a short circuit current (Isc) (Fig. 1). Application of a CaCC inhibitor, DIDS (100 μm) or niflumic acid (10 μm), inhibited ATP-induced transport in the trachea (Fig. 1, A and B). Activation of Cl− secretion was suppressed by the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (10 μm) or by depletion of intracellular endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores with cyclopiazonic acid (10 μm) (Fig. 1, C and D). CaCC have been found in primary murine nasal cell cultures and in cystic fibrosis nasal epithelium but not in normal murine nasal tissue (20Grubb B.R. Rogers T.D. Diggs P.C. Boucher R.C.

We occasionally detected a small Cl− secretory response upon ATP stimulation, which was insignificant, however (Fig. 2, A and B). mRNA analysis demonstrated the presence of mouse bestrophin-1, -2, and -4 in both the trachea and nose (Fig. 2C). However, Western blot analysis detected BEST1 protein only in the trachea but not in the nasal epithelium (Fig. 2D). Expression of BEST1 was further demonstrated by immunohistochemistry using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit IgG. BEST1 was detected in the tracheal epithelium at lower and higher magnifications, whereas control stains without primary antibody were negative (Fig. 2, E and F). Thus, expression of BEST1 correlates with the appearance of Ca2+-activated Cl− currents in mouse trachea.FIGURE 2Expression of BEST1 in mouse trachea but not nose. Shown are Ussing chamber recordings of the transepithelial voltage (Vte). A and B, ATP (100 μm) induced a negative voltage deflection and a short circuit current (Isc) due to activation of CaCC in mouse trachea but not nasal epithelium. The asterisk indicates significant difference compared with the control (paired Student's t test). The number of experiments is indicated in parentheses. C, shown are the results from RT-PCR analysis of mRNA (with (+) and without (−) reverse transcriptase) isolated from mouse tracheal and nasal epithelium. The mRNAs of all three mouse isoforms of bestrophin are expressed in both the trachea and nose. D, expression of BEST1 protein could be detected only in the trachea but not nasal epithelium. The actin band is shown to indicate equal loading. E and F, shown is the detection of BEST1 expression in the tracheal epithelium at two magnifications using horseradish peroxidase. Arrowheads indicate expression on the apical side of the tracheal epithelium. Controls were obtained without primary antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined CaCC in different human airway epithelial cell lines. In patch clamp experiments with human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE), a whole cell Cl− current was activated by 100 μm ATP, which was inhibited by 100 μm DIDS (Fig. 3). Expression of BEST1 protein in 16HBE cells was verified by Western blotting (data not shown). We suppressed expression of BEST1 in 16HBE cells by incubation with BEST1 siRNA. Successful suppression was verified by semiquantitative RT-PCR, BEST1 immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting (Fig. 3E). ATP-induced whole cell conductances were significantly reduced in siRNA-treated cells compared with control cells or cells transfected with scrambled RNA (Fig. 3D). Ca2+-activated whole cell conductances were compared in four different human airway epithelial cell lines grown on glass coverslips (Fig. 4). Because both Cl− and K+ currents may be activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+, we stimulated the cells in the presence of the K+ channel blockers Ba2+ (5 mm) and tetraethylammonium (10 mm). RT-PCR analysis of the four human bestrophin isoforms demonstrated expression of BEST1 in 16HBE and Calu-3 cells but not in H441 and 9HTE cells (Fig. 4). Accordingly, ATP-activated Cl− currents were found only in 16HBE and Calu-3 cells but not in H441 and 9HTE cells. This further suggests that expression of endogenous BEST1 allows for Ca2+-activated Cl− currents in airway epithelial cells.FIGURE 4Expression of bestrophins in different human airway epithelial cell lines. Shown are the results from RT-PCR analysis (with (+) and without (−) reverse transcriptase) of the four human isoforms of bestrophin (BEST1–4) in four different human airway epithelial cell lines (left panels). Whole cell conductances were measured before and after stimulation of airway epithelial cells by 100 μm ATP in the presence of the K+ channel blockers Ba2+ (5 mm) and tetraethylammonium (TEA; 10 mm) (right panels). ATP activated a whole cell current only in respiratory cell lines that express BEST1. The asterisks indicate significant difference compared with the control (paired Student's t test). n.s. indicates no significant changes upon ATP stimulation. The number of experiments is indicated in parentheses. nS, nanosiemens.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also detected expression of BEST1 along with BEST4 in the human colonic cancer cell line HT29 (Fig. 5A). These cells activated a Ca2+-dependent Cl− conductance upon stimulation with ATP (Fig. 5B). Similar results, e.g. expression of BEST1 mRNA and protein along with Ca2+-activated Cl− currents, were obtained in the colonic cancer cell line T84 (data not shown). We suppressed expression of BEST1 in HT29 cells by BEST1 siRNA. BEST1 knockdown was 61–78% according to densitometric analysis of Western blots (Fig. 5D). Incubation of the cells with scrambled unrelated RNA showed no effects. Whole cell patch clamp analysis demonstrated largely reduced Ca2+ (ATP)-activated whole cell currents in siRNA-treated cells compared with control cells or cells transfected with scrambled RNA. Of 23 siRNA-incubated cells, none showed a current similar in size to control cells (Fig. 5, C and E). We further examined expression of BEST1 in native mouse colonic epithelium. To this end, we isolated proximal and distal colonic epithelia and determined ion transport activated by carbachol stimulation (100 μm) of basolateral M3 receptors. In the proximal colon, carbachol induced a fast and negative voltage deflection due to activation of a transient Cl− secretion. In contrast, stimulation of the distal colon activated a delayed luminal K+ secretion (Fig. 6, A and B). Expression of both BEST1 mRNA and protein was more prominent in isolated colonic crypts of the proximal colon (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry clearly detected BEST1 expression in the mouse proximal colon, whereas only a few cells stained positive for BEST1 in the distal colonic epithelium (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results suggest that BEST1 also participates in Ca2+-dependent Cl− secretion in the proximal colonic epithelium. In mouse collecting duct cells, ATP activated a whole cell conductance, which was inhibited by 100 μm DIDS but not by 5 mm Ba2+ (Fig. 7A). The corresponding I/V curves were linear (Fig. 7B), probably due to high intracellular Ca2+ levels induced by purinergic stimulation (data not shown). We added an anti-mouse BEST1 antibody (1:500) to the patch pipette filling solution, which binds to the C-terminal end of BEST1. Inclusion of this antibody significantly reduced the whole cell conductance activated by 100 μm ATP (Fig. 7, C and D). M1 cells expressed mRNAs for the two isoforms BEST1 and BEST2 (Fig. 7E). Expression of BEST1 protein was detected in lysates from M1 cells and mouse kidney (Fig. 7F). In mouse kidney, immunohistochemistry detected expression of BEST1 throughout the medulla and cortex, with the strongest expression in the region of the papilla. However, not all cells within a tubular segment expressed BEST1, and thus, a rather spotted staining was obtained. Fig. 7G shows co-staining of the cytoskeleton (red) and BEST1 (green). In agreement with this result, CaCC have been found in cells from almost all renal tubular segments (4Hartzell C. Putzier I. Arreola J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 719-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). To further confirm a role for BEST1 as a CaCC, we expressed human BEST1 in HEK293 cells. Expression was verified by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry (data not shown). HEK293 cells coexpressing BEST1 and EGFP activated a whole cell conductance upon stimulation with 100 μm ATP. This was not observed in HEK293 cells expressing only EGFP (Fig. 8, A and B). Coexpressing cells demonstrated an enhanced base-line conductance and a reduced membrane voltage, probably due to enhanced base-line Cl− conductance. Membrane voltage was further depolarized, and the whole cell conductance was inhibited by reducing the bath Cl− concentration to 30 mm (Fig. 8, B and C). The ATP-activated whole cell conductance was inhibited by 100 μm DIDS (Fig. 8D). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Ca2+-dependent Cl− currents in epithelial cells from airways, colon, and kidney are due to expression of BEST1. CaCC are fundamental for fluid secretion in acini of exocrine tissues, such as lachrymal, parotid, mandibular, and pancreatic glands (23Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1996; 432: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In airways and in the colonic epithelium, electrolyte secretion is dominated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channels (24Kunzelmann K. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 137: 1-70PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from CFTR, Cl− secretion is activated through stimulation of CaCC present in the apical membranes of airways and other organs. Previous studies showed that (i) application of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin also activates Cl− secretion; (ii) in the presence of low (1 μm) extracellular Ca2+, activation of Cl− secretion is very transient; (iii) after inhibition of phospholipase C, purinergic Cl− secretion is reduced; and (iv) DIDS inhibits Ca2+-activated Cl− secretion in mouse airways (18Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 444: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These and other experiments (19Mall M. Gonska T. Thomas J. Schreiber R. Seydewitz H.H. Kuehr J. Brandis M. Kunzelmann K. Pediatr. Res. 2003; 53: 608-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that secretion occurs through Ca2+-dependent activation of Cl− channels. Outwardly rectifying Cl− channels are unlikely candidates because Ca2+ activates small conductance Cl− channels in HT29 and 16HBE cells (25Kubitz R. Warth R. Allert N. Kunzelmann K. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1992; 421: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Kunzelmann K. Kubitz R. Grolik M. Warth R. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1992; 421: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both CFTR and CaCC control airway surface liquid, which is essential for mucociliary clearance (27Tarran R. Button B. Boucher R.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 543-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Purinergic activation of CaCC in the airways resembles an important therapeutic principle for cystic fibrosis (28Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Grubb B.R. van Heusden C.A. Okada S. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36855-36864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Am. J. Respir. Med. 2003; 2: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cl− secretion in mouse airways is dominated by CaCC, which explains why CFTR knock-out animals do not develop a cystic fibrosis lung disease (21Grubb B.R. Boucher R.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S193-S214Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a functional relationship exists between CaCC and CFTR (30Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Briel M. Hipper A. Nitschke R. Ricken S. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 434: 178-181Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Wei L. Vankeerberghen A. Cuppens H. Eggermont J. Cassiman J.J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 438: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and Ca2+-mediated Cl− secretion is enhanced in cystic fibrosis airways (19Mall M. Gonska T. Thomas J. Schreiber R. Seydewitz H.H. Kuehr J. Brandis M. Kunzelmann K. Pediatr. Res. 2003; 53: 608-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+-activated Cl− secretion is found in cystic fibrosis but not normal murine nasal epithelium (21Grubb B.R. Boucher R.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S193-S214Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). After pre-stimulation of CFTR, CaCC was also activated in normal nasal epithelium. However, this is probably due to activation of basolateral K+ channels rather than activation of luminal CaCC (32Clarke L.L. Grubb B.R. Gabriel S.E. Smithies O. Koller B.H. Boucher R.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although transcripts for BEST1 were detected in the nasal epithelium, no significant levels of BEST protein were found. This is probably not explained by mRNA instability because no AU-rich elements could be detected. In the human colonic epithelia of older infants and adults, CaCC-mediated Cl− secretion is less important. Thus, no Cl− secretion is found in the absence of functional CFTR, e.g. in the colonic epithelia of cystic fibrosis patients (33Berschneider H.M. Knowles M.R. Azizkhan R.G. Boucher R.C. Tobey N.A. Orlando R.C. Powell D.W. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2625-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34Mall M. Bleich M. Schürlein M. Kühr J. Seydewitz H.H. Brandis M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Am. J.

Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 278: G617-G624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, younger infants may express CaCC in the colonic epithelium and therefore be susceptible to virus-induced diarrhea. In fact, age-dependent diarrhea was induced in mice by the rotavirus toxin NSP4 in a previous study (36Ball J.M. Tian P. Zeng C.Q. Morris A.P. Estes M.K. Science. 1996; 272: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). NSP4 increases intracellular Ca2+ and activates Cl− secretion in newborn mouse pups (37Dong Y. Zeng C.Q. Ball J.M. Estes M.K. Morris A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3960-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the present study, we detected Ca2+-activated Cl− secretion in the proximal but not distal colon. Accordingly, BEST1 was well detected in the proximal but not distal colon. The role of CaCC in the kidney is controversial (38Schlatter E. Greger R. Schafer J.A. Pflügers Arch. 1990; 417: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Leipziger J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 284: F419-F432Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, in studies with primary and permanent cultures of proximal and distal tubules, thick ascending limb, and collecting ducts, CaCC was identified (40Barrière H. Belfodil R. Rubera I. Tauc M.

Renal Physiol. 1996; 271: F940-F950Crossref Google Scholar). Also in the present experiments with M1 collecting duct cells, CaCC was detected. Thus, renal epithelial cells may retain the ability to induce Ca2+-activated Cl− transport. Sulfhydryl scanning enabled structure-function analysis and demonstrated that bestrophins form bona fide Cl− channels (44Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 45Tsunenari T. Sun H. Williams J. Cahill H. Smallwood P. Yau K.W. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41114-41125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Direct activation of BEST4 by Ca2+ was demonstrated in excised membrane patches (46Tsunenari T. Nathans J. Yau K.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been proposed that BEST1 is a regulator of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels rather than a Ca2+-regulated Cl− channel (47Rosenthal R. Bakall B. Kinnick T. Peachey N. Wimmers S. Wadelius C. Marmorstein A. Strauss O. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 48Marmorstein L.Y. Wu J. McLaughlin P. Yocom J. Karl M.O. Neussert R. Wimmers S. Stanton J.B. Gregg R.G. Strauss O. Peachey N.S. Marmorstein A.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Purinergic increase in [Ca2+]i was augmented in retinal pigment epithelium cells of Vmd2−/− mice. In this study, the [Ca2+]i increase was remarkably slow. This is in sharp contrast to Ca2+ responses observed in the epithelial tissues used here: the [Ca2+]i increase occurred within <1 s and was typically 4–10-fold (data not shown). Moreover, the ATP-induced Ca2+ increase is due to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (peak) and Ca2+ influx, probably through transient receptor potential-related Ca2+ channels (plateau) (49Nilius B. Voets T. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Preliminary unpublished measurements show only insignificant changes in Ca2+ signaling upon manipulation of BEST1 expression. The present data show endogenous expression of BEST1 in mouse and human epithelial cells from airways, colon, and kidney. BEST1 expression clearly correlated with the appearance of CaCC. Rectification of the Cl− currents varied between the different cell lines. I/V curves were almost linear for M1 and HEK293 cells but were rectifying for 16HBE cells. Rectification depends on the level of [Ca2+]i and disappears at high (>1 μm) concentrations (3Kuruma A. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 59-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 42Qu Z. Wei R.W. Hartzell H.C. Am. J. Physiol.

Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). ATP increased [Ca2+]i to values above 1 μm in M1 cells but to values below 1 μm in 16HBE cells (data not shown), which may explain the variability. In HT29 and 16HBE cells, suppression of BEST1 by siRNA inhibited CaCC. These results clearly indicate that BEST1 is necessary for Ca2+-activated Cl− secretion. However, they do not rule out the possibility that BEST1 is a regulator of a still unidentified CaCC or that it is part of a Cl− channel complex. Only a fraction of BEST1 appears to be localized in the plasma membrane, whereas most is found in the cytosol, probably bound to vesicular membranes (15Stanton J.B. Goldberg A.F. Hoppe G.

The spotted expression of BEST1 in some tissues suggests that CaCC is not equally present within the epithelium. Thus, expression may depend on additional factors, which should be the subject of subsequent studies. We gratefully acknowledge the supply of human BEST1 cDNA from Prof. Dr. J.

https://openalex.org/W1978530652,"Here we tested the role of calcium influx factor (CIF) and calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) in activation of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels and store-operated Ca2+ entry in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. We demonstrate that 1) endogenous CIF production may be triggered by Ca2+ release (net loss) as well as by simple buffering of free Ca2+ within the stores, 2) a specific 82-kDa variant of iPLA2β and its corresponding activity are present in membrane fraction of RBL cells, 3) exogenous CIF (extracted from other species) mimics the effects of endogenous CIF and activates iPLA2β when applied to cell homogenates but not intact cells, 4) activation of ICRAC can be triggered in resting RBL cells by dialysis with exogenous CIF, 5) molecular or functional inhibition of iPLA2β prevents activation of ICRAC, which could be rescued by cell dialysis with a human recombinant iPLA2β, 6) dependence of ICRAC on intracellular pH strictly follows pH dependence of iPLA2β activity, and 7) (S)-BEL, a chiral enantiomer of suicidal substrate specific for iPLA2β, could be effectively used for pharmacological inhibition of ICRAC and store-operated Ca2+ entry. These findings validate and significantly advance our understanding of the CIF-iPLA2-dependent mechanism of activation of ICRAC and store-operated Ca2+ entry.

Store-operated channels (SOC) 2The abbreviations used are: SOC, store-operated channel; SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry; iPLA2, calcium-independent phospholipase A2; rec-iPLA2β, recombinant iPLA2β; CIF, Ca2+ influx factor; CRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+-conducting channel; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; BEL, bromoenol lactone (formula name, 6E-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one); CaM, calmodulin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; (R)-BEL, (R) enantiomer of bromoenol lactone; (S)-BEL, (S) enantiomer of bromoenol lactone; TG, thapsigargin; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine; pF, picofarad(s). and Ca2+ entry (SOCE) are triggered by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in a wide variety of cell types (for review, see Ref. 1Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Recently we discovered Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) to be a crucial determinant of SOCE (2Smani T. Zakharov S. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3Smani T. Zakharov S. Leno E. Csutora P. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11909-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and a physiological target for a mysterious Ca2+ influx factor (CIF) that is produced by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) upon Ca2+ store depletion. We proposed a mechanism (2Smani T. Zakharov S. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) that mediates not only activation but also termination of SOCE. We demonstrated that CIF displaces inhibitory calmodulin (CaM) from iPLA2 leading to its activation and production of lysophospholipids that in turn activate SOC and SOCE in vascular smooth muscle cells. Upon refilling of the stores and termination of CIF production, CaM binds to iPLA2 and inhibits it, and the activity of SOC and SOCE is halted. Consistent with a major role of iPLA2, a growing number of studies demonstrated that its irreversible inhibition impairs SOCE in different cell types (2Smani T. Zakharov S. Csutora P. Leno E.

However, no detailed study of CIF-iPLA2-dependent mechanism has been done in the cells in which SOCE is mediated by a highly Ca2+-selective SOC (historically called CRAC) (10Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). The whole-cell current through CRAC channels (ICRAC) remains a golden standard for the studies of SOC and mechanisms of its regulation (for review, see Ref. 1Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Our present studies were designed to test the validity and functionality of the CIF-iPLA2-dependent pathway in CRAC channel activation, to obtain new important information related to the signal that triggers CIF production, the specific isoform of iPLA2 that may be involved as well as the functional regulation of ICRAC through regulation of iPLA2 in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, one of the well established models for CRAC channel studies. CIF is known to be produced in the cells when their Ca2+ stores are depleted after either active Ca2+ release (usually as a result of agonist-induced Ca2+ discharge from the stores) or as a result of passive Ca2+ loss (when Ca2+ back-sequestration into the stores is prevented). Although the molecular identity of CIF remains a mystery, its presence and biological activity was detected in numerous cell types, from yeast to humans (11Thomas D. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6429-6432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26158-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For a complete review of the present knowledge related to CIF we will refer the readers to specialized reviews (1Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar, 14Bolotina V.M. Csutora P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 378-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here we will concentrate on some new questions, such as what is the physiological signal that triggers CIF production, how ubiquitous is production of CIF, and how interchangeable is its biological activity between different species. It is generally thought that activation of SOCE is triggered by a net Ca2+ loss from ER (for review, see Refs. 1Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar and 15Elliott A.C. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, another attractive possibility exists that a simple reduction in free Ca2+ concentration within the stores (without physical Ca2+ loss) may be enough for triggering SOCE in a dose-dependent manner (16Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It is presently unknown what kind of changes in intraluminal Ca2+ may be sufficient for triggering CIF production; does it necessarily need to be a Ca2+ loss (as widely believed), or could it be a simple reduction in free Ca2+ concentration in the stores. If the later is true, CIF production and SOCE activation may be a natural response of the cell not only to agonist-induced discharge of Ca2+ from the stores but also to variations in free Ca2+ in the stores due to pathological changes in the expression levels of intraluminal Ca2+ binding proteins, such as calsequestrin and calreticulin (for review, see Refs. 17Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar and 18Ma J. Pan Z. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here we tested if simple Ca2+ buffering in the stores may or may not trigger CIF production and how it may relate to CIF produced upon physical Ca2+ loss. We also tested if CIF produced by different types of cells and species could be interchangeable and if exogenously applied CIF can mimic the effects of endogenous CIF in activating iPLA2 and SOC. It is now well established that iPLA2 (group VI encoded by PLA2G6) is not a single, but a growing family of enzymes (19Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 20Winstead M.V. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48968-48975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Two major isoforms of iPLA2 have been identified and intensively studied (for reviews, see Ref. 20Winstead M.V. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar and 22Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar): iPLA2β (group VIA) and iPLA2γ (group VIB). The signature feature of iPLA2β is that it contains CaM binding domain, making it possible for CaM to bind and inhibit its activity (23Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20989-20992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Jenkins C.M. Wolf M.J. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7129-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This unique feature discriminates iPLA2β from other iPLA2s and provides a perfect design for its specific role in the SOCE pathway (2Smani T. Zakharov S. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Another prominent feature of some variants of iPLA2β is multiple ankyrin repeats in the N terminus, which may be important for their cellular localization and assembly into specific signaling domains. In vascular smooth muscle cells we found that iPLA2β remains functional at the inner leaflet of excised plasma membrane patches (2Smani T. Zakharov S. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which was consistent with its plasma membrane localization reported in some cell types (25Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Zhang S. Jin C. Bohrer A. Song H. Bao S. Ma Z. Turk J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 918-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Larsson Forsell P.K.A. Kennedy B.P. Claesson H.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, in numerous studies iPLA2β was found in cytosol (27Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yang H.C. Mosior M. Ni B. Dennis E.A. J.

J. 2002; 362: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and nucleus (25Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Zhang S. Jin C. Bohrer A. Song H. Bao S. Ma Z. Turk J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 918-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). There is also some evidence for its possible translocation to perinuclear and plasma membranes (25Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Zhang S. Jin C. Bohrer A. Song H. Bao S. Ma Z. Turk J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 918-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Tay H.K. Melendez A.J. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: 186-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of multiple splice variants of iPLA2β isoform (33Turk J. Ramanadham S. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2004; 82: 824-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as well as their post-translational modifications (34Song H. Hecimovic S. Goate A. Hsu F.F. Bao S. Vidavsky I. Ramanadham S. Turk J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1780-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) may be some of the reasons for inconsistence in iPLA2β localization. Further studies are necessary to determine which splice variant of iPLA2β is required and sufficient for activation of plasma membrane channels and SOCE. Here we test the main steps in the CIF-mediated iPLA2-dependent SOCE pathway and unveil new important details in CIF production, iPLA2 specificity, and CIF-iPLA2-dependent mechanism of activation of ICRAC and capacitative Ca2+ entry in RBL-2H3 cells. Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 IU/10,000 μg/ml). Cells were passed every 3 days at a ratio of 1:5 and used for up to 12 passages. For Ca2+ imaging and patch clamp experiments, RBL cells were grown on small coverslips (∼5 × 5 mm) placed into 6-well plates. For CIF preparations, Western blots, and iPLA2 activity measurements, RBL cells were grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Bromoenol lactone (BEL), thapsigargin (TG), N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), and most other drugs were purchased from Sigma. Fura-2 and fura-2 AM were from Invitrogen. Anti-iPLA2β, a polyclonal antiserum against a 19-amino acid peptide (NQIHSKDPRYGASPLHWAK) specific to the ankyrin region of iPLA2β (24Jenkins C.M. Wolf M.J. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7129-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was a generous gift of Dr. R. W. Gross. Human recombinant iPLA2β (rec-iPLA2β) was expressed in and purified from Sf9 cells as previously described by Dr. Gross (21Jenkins C.M. Mancuso D.J. Yan W. Sims H.F. Gibson B. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48968-48975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 35Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus harboring the human recombinant iPLA2βHis6. After lysis of the cells, iPLA2β was purified from the cytosol using Co2+ affinity chromatography followed by ATP-agarose chromatography. Column fractions in each step were assayed for iPLA2 activity as described below. The final rec-iPLA2β concentration was typically 0.15–0.18 μg/μl. Chiral enantiomers of BEL ((S)- and (R)-BEL)) were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) utilizing a Chirex column of 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl-(R)-phenylglycine attached to a silica matrix (Phenomenex) as previously described (22Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is important to notice that BEL and its enantiomers are suicidal substrates for iPLA2; inhibition is irreversible, requires basal activity of this enzyme, and strongly depends on temperature, duration of treatment, and concentration used (3Smani T. Zakharov S. Leno E. Csutora P. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11909-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In experiments with intact cells the optimal conditions for BEL treatment (to ensure complete inhibition of iPLA2) are the following; intact cells need to be pretreated (in bath solution not containing bovine serum albumin or serum) with 10–25 μm BEL for 30 min at 37 °C, and then BEL can be washed away before the beginning of the experiments. In cases where iPLA2 is already active, significantly shorter (1–5 min) treatments may fully inhibit the enzyme. CIF extracts were purified from human platelets and from RBL-2H3 cells. Human Platelets—Crude CIF extracts were obtained as described before (13Trepakova E.S. Csutora P. Marchase R.B. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26158-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, resting (unstimulated) platelets (obtained from the local Red Cross) were kept at room temperature and used immediately for preparation of the control CIF extracts that contained no or very little CIF activity (control extract). Extracts containing high CIF activity (CIF) were prepared from platelets with depleted Ca2+ stores, which was achieved by exposing them to cold (4 °C) overnight, with subsequent application of TG (2 μm for 20 min). To prepare crude extracts, platelets (50 ml per platelet pack, about 1011 cells) were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (20 ml) and resuspended in 0.85 ml of the same solution. The suspension was extracted with 0.2 ml of 1 m hydrochloric acid for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant was neutralized (10 m NaOH), and BaCl2 (10 mm) was added to precipitate compounds containing vicinal phosphates, including inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. After centrifugation the supernatant was lyophilized, and the residue was extracted with methanol (0.8 ml) with continuous mixing for 15 min. The methanol extract was loaded on a Sep-Pak Vac C18 cartridge (Waters), and the cartridge was washed with methanol (0.8 ml). The combined methanol elutes were dried at 30 °C under N2 gas and resuspended in 200 μl of 100 mm acetic acid. The reconstituted extract was clarified by centrifugal ultrafiltration through a Ultrafree-MC 30-kDa filter (Millipore). To obtain fine extracts, the crude extracts were further subjected to anion exchange HPLC followed by reversed-phase HPLC. Unless specified, all the experiments in this study were done with crude CIF extracts. RBL Cells—RBL cells grown in 10-cm culture dishes were washed with serum-free media and then treated with either 1 μm TG or 1 mm TPEN for 5 min at 37 °C to initiate CIF production. CIF was prepared from the cells exactly as described above for human platelets; however, the final dried methanol elutes were reconstituted in 50 μl of 100 mm acetic acid instead of the 200 μl used for platelets. Stage V and VI oocytes were harvested from albino Xenopus laevis frogs (Xenopus Express) under anesthesia with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (MS-222, Sigma). After defolliculation in 2 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Applied Science), oocytes were maintained for up to 5 days in standard ND-96 oocyte media of the following composition: 96 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.5) supplemented with 2.5 mm pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 5% horse serum. CIF activities were assayed by microinjection of extracts into fura-2-loaded albino oocytes (12Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Oocytes were transferred to Ca2+-free oocyte Ringer (OR-2) buffer solution (82 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl (pH 7.5)) and microinjected with 14 nl of fura-2 free acid (1 mm in 125 mm KCl) using a Nanoject-II injector (Drummond). Injected oocytes were allowed at least 2 h of recovery and kept at 4 °C until used for the bioassay. Next, an individual oocyte was transferred into a homemade imaging chamber containing Ca2+-free OR-2 solution, mounted on the stage of a Nikon Eclipse TS-100 inverted microscope. Changes in intracellular free Ca2+ were measured through a Nikon 20× Super Fluor objective (NA = 0.75) using a rapid excitation filter changer alternating between 340 and 380 nm (Sutter Instruments) and a CCD camera (Cooke PixelFly) and analyzed using the InCyt IM2 software (Intracellular Imaging). A micropipette containing CIF extract was inserted into the oocyte around the equatorial plane before the beginning of the recording. After obtaining a stable recording base line, CaCl2 (5 mm) was added to the extracellular bath solution to first test the oocytes for nonspecific Ca2+ leak and to verify that the membrane seal around the pipette was tight and Ca2+ was not leaking in. About 1 min later CIF extract (28 nl) was injected to trigger Ca2+ influx across the oocyte membrane. CIF activity was determined based on the changes in intracellular Ca2+ (expressed as ΔRatio), which was calculated as the difference between the peak F340/F380 ratio (6 min after injection), and its basal level right before injection. RBL cells were transfected using Nucleofector II (Amaxa Biosystems). Batches of 1.5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution R at room temperature followed by the addition of 2 μg of antisense or sense DNA together with 2 μg of green fluorescent protein. A 20-base-long antisense (5′-fluorescein-CTCCTTCACCCGGAATGGGT-3′) and sense (5′-fluorescein-ACCCATTCCGGGTGAAGGAG-3′) specific to iPLA2β was used as in our previous studies (3Smani T. Zakharov S. Leno E. Csutora P. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11909-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transfection was done at the T-20 setting of the Nucleofector II device. Immediately after transfection, the RBL cells were transferred to minimum essential medium and plated on the coverslips. Cells showing green protein fluorescence (excitation at 480 nm, emission at 515 nm) were used for experiments 38 ± 4 h after transfection. RBL cells were homogenized on ice by sonication in the absence or presence of 1% Triton X-100 in the homogenization buffer containing 300 mm sucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The cell homogenate was centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 14,000 × rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate membrane and cytosol fractions. The membrane fraction was resuspended in the same homogenization buffer. The total protein amount in each sample was determined using the Bio-Rad protein dye reagent (Bradford method). The protein samples were incubated with Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C for 2 min, and then one-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis was performed in 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels in a Mini-Protein system (Bio-Rad) with 30 μg of total protein loaded in each lane. Rec-iPLA2β of 84 kDa was used as a standard (0.5–1.0 ng) in all Western blots. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose membrane in a Mini Trans-blot system (Bio-Rad). Blots were incubated for 1 h with 5% (w/v) skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) to block residual protein binding sites. Blocked membranes were then incubated with primary anti-iPLA2β (1:2000 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. The primary antibody was removed, and blots were washed 3 times for 10 min with milk/PBST. Then blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling) diluted 1:2000 in milk/PBST, washed 3 times in PBST, and treated with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Super ECL, Pierce) for 1 min. Blots were then exposed to photographic films, and the optical density was determined using the Un-scan-it analysis software (Silk Scientific). The activity of iPLA2 was determined as previously described (2Smani T. Zakharov S. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, after each experimental treatment, RBL cells were homogenized as described above. The activity of iPLA2 was determined in either total cell homogenate or in membrane and cytosol fractions, as specified in the figures. The iPLA2 activity was measured using a modified commercial assay kit originally designed for the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (Cayman). To detect the activity of iPLA2 instead of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), the assay buffers were modified to contain no Ca2+ (Ca2+ is needed for cPLA2 but not for iPLA2 activity). Phospholipase activity was assayed by incubating the samples with the substrate, 1-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoylthio-2-deoxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine for 1 h at room temperature in a modified Ca2+-free assay buffer of the following composition 300 mm NaCl, 60% glycerol, 10 mm HEPES, 8 mm Triton X-100, 4 mm EGTA, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). The generated free thiols were visualized by the addition of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-dinitrobenzoic acid) for 5 min, and the absorbance was determined at 405 nm using a standard microplate reader. The background iPLA2-independent component of basal lipase activity was determined in control samples when all specific iPLA2 activity was inhibited with (S)-BEL (10 μm for 5 min) and was subtracted from all the readings. The presence of 4 mm EGTA in the assay buffer (which was crucial for suppressing the contaminant Ca2+-dependent cPLA2 activity) did not by itself cause any significant activation of Ca2+-independent BEL-sensitive iPLA2. The specific activity of iPLA2 was expressed in absorbance/mg of protein units. RBL cells were transferred to minimum essential culture medium without serum and loaded with fura-2 AM (2 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Then the cells were washed for 10 min and transferred to the bath solution of the following composition: 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA (pH 7.4). During the experiment, CaCl2 (2 mm) was added to the cells to observe Ca2+ influx following different treatments as described under “Results.” Ca2+ measurements were done at 20–22 °C. A dual-excitation fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging, see description above) was used for studies of individual RBL cells. The changes in intracellular Ca2+ were expressed as ΔRatio, which was calculated as the difference between the peak F340/F380 ratio after extracellular Ca2+ was added and its level right before Ca2+ addition. Summary data are shown without subtraction of the basal Ca2+ influx. Data were summarized from the large number of individual cells (20–40 cells tested each in 3–6 different experiments from at least 3 cell preparations). Whole-cell currents were recorded in RBL cells using the standard whole-cell (dialysis) patch clamp technique as we previously described (3Smani T. Zakharov S. Leno E. Csutora P. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11909-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Axopatch 200B amplifier was used; data were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Pipettes were used with tip resistance of 2–4 megaohms. After breaking into the cell, the holding potential was 0 mV, and ramp depolarizations (from –100 to +100 mV, 200 ms) were applied every 3 s. Amplitude of the current was expressed in pA/pF. The time course of current development was analyzed at –80 mV for each individual cell, and summary data for 5+ cells are shown in the figures. Average I/V relationships are shown during ramp depolarization after the current reached its maximum. Passive leakage current with zero reversal potential (at the moment of breaking into the cell or after CRAC inhibition with 10 μm diethylstilbestrol) was subtracted. Intracellular (pipette) solution contained 145 mm cesium glutamate, 10 mm BAPTA, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2). In some experiments concentration of BAPTA was reduced to 0.1–1 mm. Extracellular solution was 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 3 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgC"

The process may involve a swinging mechanism in which the same face of the FMN module accepts and provides electrons during catalysis. Crystal structure shows that this face of the FMN module is electronegative, whereas the complementary interacting surface is electropositive, implying that charge interactions enable function. We used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the roles of six electronegative surface residues of the FMN module in electron transfer and catalysis in neuronal NOS. Results are interpreted in light of crystal structures of NOS and related flavoproteins. Neutralizing or reversing the negative charge of each residue altered the NO synthesis, NADPH oxidase, and cytochrome c reductase activities of neuronal NOS and also altered heme reduction. The largest effects occurred at the NOS-specific charged residue Glu762. Together, the results suggest that electrostatic interactions of the FMN module help to regulate electron transfer and to minimize flavin autoxidation and the generation of reactive oxygen species during NOS catalysis.

NOS enzymes have unique characteristics, and their protein structure-function relationships are of current interest. All mammalian NOS enzymes are comprised of an N-terminal oxygenase domain and a C-terminal flavoprotein domain, with a calmodulin (CaM)-binding site connecting the two domains (3Masters B.S. McMillan K. Sheta E.A. Nishimura J.S. Roman L.J. Martásek P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). During NO synthesis, the flavoprotein domain transfers NADPH-derived electrons through its FAD and FMN cofactors to a heme located in the oxygenase domain. This enables NOS to catalyze heme-dependent oxygen activation and a stepwise conversion of l-Arg to NO and citrulline (4Andrew P.J. Mayer B. Cardiovasc.

CaM binding to NOS activates NO synthesis by triggering electron transfer from the FMN to the heme (6Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All are comprised of a ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) module that contains FAD and that binds NADPH, a connecting subdomain that is inserted into the FNR module, and an FMN module. All transfer NADPH-derived electrons to native hemeprotein acceptors (NOS and cytochrome P450BM3) or to artificial hemeprotein acceptors like cytochrome c. In nNOS, the electron transfer process appears to involve a conformational equilibrium of the FMN module (9Newman E. Spratt D.E. Mosher J. Cheyne B. Montgomery H.J. Wilson D.L. Weinberg J.B.

The FMN module must dock with the FNR module in an “FMN-shielded” conformation to receive electrons from FAD. Thereafter, the FMN module must swing away by means of a flexible linker to populate an “FMN-deshielded” conformation to interact with electron acceptors like the NOS oxygenase domain and cytochrome c. The crystal structure of nNOSr (15Garcin E.D. Bruns C.M. Lloyd S.J. Hosfield D.J. Tiso M. Gachhui R. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. J. Biol.

For nNOS, the equilibrium between the FMN-shielded and FMN-deshielded conformations appears to have an intrinsic set point that can be influenced by several factors. For example, CaM binding shifts the equilibrium toward the FMN-deshielded conformation (16Konas D.W. Zhu K. Sharma M. Aulak K.S. Brudvig G.W. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Shifting the conformational equilibrium of the FMN module in nNOS directly impacts its cytochrome c reductase activity and, in some cases, alters the susceptibility of its reduced flavins to autoxidation (16Konas D.W.

Charged residues at the FMN module interface are prominent in the crystal structure of nNOSr (15Garcin E.D. Bruns C.M. Lloyd S.J. Hosfield D.J. Tiso M. Gachhui R. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D.

Acta. 1998; 1387: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Six acidic residues create an electronegative patch on the surface of the FMN module in nNOSr (Fig. 3A). This electronegative patch interacts with a complementary electropositive patch on the surface of the FNR module (Fig. 3B). A closer view of how these residues interact is shown in Fig. 3C. Similar electrostatic complementation is present to varying degrees in related flavoproteins, suggesting that it may be a general means to control subdomain interactions. NOS oxygenase domains also contain an electropositive surface patch (Fig. 3D) in an area considered to be a potential docking site for the FMN module (28Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Thus, electrostatic interactions could conceivably regulate both the electron import and export reactions of the FMN module during NOS catalysis. We therefore employed point mutagenesis to neutralize or reverse the charges of the six acidic residues that create the electronegative patch on the FMN module, along with the interactions of one residue in the complementary electropositive surface patch of the FNR module, as listed in Table 1. The results obtained with these mutants support a role for electrostatic surface interactions in controlling electron transfer, O2 reduction, and catalysis in nNOS and reveal which residues are the most important.TABLE 1Mutations used in the studynNOS mutationsFMN moduleGlu762 to Asn, Arg, or AlaGlu789 to Asn, Arg, or AlaGlu790 to Asn, Arg, or AlaAsp813 to Asn, Arg, or AlaGlu816 to Asn, Arg, or AlaGlu819 to Asn, Arg, or AlaFNR moduleArg1229 to Asn, Glu, or Ala Open table in a new tab Reagents—All reagents and materials were obtained from Sigma or sources reported previously (29Adak S.

The ferrous heme-CO adduct absorbing at 444 nm was used to measure hemeprotein content with an extinction coefficient of ϵ444 = 74 mm-1 cm-1 (A444-A500). Measurement of Flavin Content—Bound FAD and FMN were released from nNOS proteins by heat denaturation of the enzyme (95 °C for 5 min in the dark) in sealed and light-protected tubes. The samples were then cooled to 4 °C and filtered to remove denatured protein. Filtrates were injected onto an Alltech Partisil ODS-3 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) and subjected to binary gradient elution with 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.8) and 100% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. FAD and FMN had retention times of 4.1 and 7.6 min, respectively, and the peaks were completely resolved. Flavins were detected by fluorescence emission (λex = 460 nm and λem = 530 nm) and quantitated against freshly prepared FAD and FMN standards.

Cuvettes contained 0.2 μm nNOS, 40 mm EPPS (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, 10 μm (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin, 10 mm l-Arg, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8 mm Ca2+, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.9 μm CaM, 100 units/ml catalase, 25 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and 5 μm oxyhemoglobin. The reaction was initiated with 300 μm NADPH in a total reaction volume of 500 μl and was run for 3 min at 25 °C. The NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin was monitored at 401 nm and converted to a rate of NO synthesis using a difference extinction coefficient of ϵ401 = 38 mm-1 cm-1. NADPH oxidation rates were similarly measured at 340 nm in the presence of oxyhemoglobin under identical conditions, and the rate of NADPH oxidation was calculated using an extinction coefficient of ϵ340 = 6.2 mm-1 cm-1. Cytochrome c reductase activity was determined at 550 nm (ϵ550 = 21 mm-1 cm-1) using an assay mixture containing 40 mm EPPS (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml CaM, 0.6 mm EDTA, 10 units/ml catalase, 25 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and 0.1 mm cytochrome c. In the cytochrome c reductase assays, the concentration of added NaCl in the buffer was either 0 or 150 mm as indicated. The reaction was initiated by addition of 0.1 mm NADPH. Heme Reduction—The kinetics of heme reduction were analyzed at 10 °C as described previously (30Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Model SF-61) equipped for anaerobic analysis. Ferric heme reduction was followed by formation of the ferrous heme-CO complex at 444 nm. Reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing an anaerobic, buffered, CO-saturated solution containing either 50 μm NADPH or 5 mm CaCl2 with an anaerobic, buffered, CO-saturated solution containing wild-type or mutant nNOS (5 μm), 100 mm EPPS (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin, 5 mm l-Arg, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μm CaM, and either 1 mm Ca2+ when triggered with NADPH or 50 μm NADPH when triggered with Ca2+. Signal-to-noise ratios were improved by averaging 8-10 individual mixing experiments. The time course of the absorbance change was fit to single or multiple exponential equations using a nonlinear least-square method provided by Hi-Tech Ltd. Overall Properties of the FMN Module Mutants—In general, the mutations incorporated at the interface of the FNR/FMN modules did not alter protein expression or content of bound FAD, FMN, and heme (data not shown). The only mutant with aberrant properties was R1229E nNOS, which bound poorly to the 2′,5′-ADP affinity column during its purification. Because of this, we did not utilize R1229E nNOS in this study. However, the properties of the other mutants indicated they could be used to evaluate roles for the charged surface residues in nNOS function. Cytochrome c Reductase Activity in the Absence or Presence of Bound CaM—The cytochrome c reductase activity of NOS is repressed in the CaM-free state, and the repression is relieved upon CaM binding (34Stuehr D.J. Ghosh S. Mayer B. Nitric Oxide. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 33-70Google Scholar). We compared the steady-state cytochrome c reductase activities of each mutant in the absence and presence of bound CaM. All assays contained superoxide dismutase to ensure we detected only superoxide-independent cytochrome c reductase activity, i.e. that which involves only a direct electron transfer from the FMN hydroquinone (FMNH2) of nNOS to cytochrome c (8Klatt P. Heinzel B. John M. Kastner M. Bohme E. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11374-11378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Craig D.H. Chapman S.K. Daff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33987-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Under CaM-free conditions, most of the mutants had higher cytochrome c reductase activities relative to wild-type nNOS (Fig. 4, left panel). The most prominent increases were in the Glu762 and Glu816 mutants. The relative effect of charge neutralization versus charge reversal depended on the acidic surface residue being considered. For example, at Glu762, the rank order of mutational effect was Asn > Ala > Arg, whereas for Glu816, the rank order was Arg > Ala > Asn. Our results show that the electronegative patch residues of the FMN module (particularly Glu762 and Glu816) help to repress the cytochrome c reductase activity of nNOS in the CaM-free state. To investigate the importance of charge interaction of each of the six acidic residues, we determined how the two charge-neutralizing mutations (Ala and Asn) at each residue might impact the salt effect on nNOS cytochrome c reductase activity. In CaM-free nNOS, a change in salt concentration from 0 to 250 mm is known to double the activity (35Roman L.J. Martásek P. Miller R.T. de la Harris D.E. Garza M.A. Shea T.M. Kim J.J.P. Siler Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29225-29232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), consistent with charge interactions playing a role in repression of the activity. In our hands, the cytochrome c reductase activity of CaM-free wild-type nNOS increased by 150 ± 8% (n = 3) in going from 0 to 150 mm added NaCl. The charge-neutralizing mutations resulted in a lesser salt effect in at least 7 of 12 cases (supplemental Table S2). A lesser salt effect was observed for both charge-neutralizing mutations at Glu762 and Asp813 and was observed for at least one of the two charge-neutralizing mutations at Glu790, Glu816, and Glu819, which together represent five of the six charged FMN surface residues that we studied. Charge neutralization did not clearly impact the salt effect in only one case, Glu789 (supplemental Table S2). These results suggest that the charge interactions of five of the six acidic surface residues of the FMN module contribute to the overall salt effect on the cytochrome c reductase activity of CaM-free nNOS. The cytochrome c reductase activities of the CaM-bound mutants are shown in Fig. 4 (right panel). Each FMN domain mutant had an increase in activity relative to the CaM-free condition, indicating that they all still responded to CaM. Most of the mutants achieved activities that were similar (±20%) to those of CaM-bound nNOS. The exceptions were the E762A, E762N, and D813N mutants, whose activities were 130%, 180%, and 160%, respectively, that of CaM-bound wild-type nNOS, and the E762R, E819R, and D813R mutants, whose activities were about 65% that of CaM-bound wild-type nNOS. The latter three mutants had normal Km values for cytochrome c (data not shown), suggesting that their lower activities were not due to an impaired interaction with cytochrome c. Together, the data indicate that charge neutralization at Glu762, Asp813, and possibly Glu819 increases the activity of CaM-bound nNOS, whereas charge reversal at these same sites diminishes activity. Fig. 4 also reports the cytochrome c reductase activities of the Arg1229 mutants. The CaM-free R1229N and R1229A mutants had only slightly higher activities compared with CaM-free wild-type nNOS, suggesting that Arg1229 is not so important for repressing activity in the CaM-free state. However, the activities of the CaM-bound R1229A and R1229N mutants were only 20% that of CaM-bound wild-type nNOS, indicating that Arg1229 enables nNOS to increase activity in response to CaM. NADPH Oxidase Activity of the CaM-free Mutants—Almost all of the CaM-free mutants oxidized NADPH at rates that exceeded wild-type nNOS (Fig. 5), despite their not synthesizing detectable NO under this circumstance (data not shown). The NADPH oxidation rates of the CaM-free E762N, E762A, and E816R mutants were highest and were 12-18 times faster than the wild-type value. The NADPH oxidation rates of the CaM-free R1229N and R1229A mutants were also four to seven times faster than that of wild-type nNOS (Fig. 5). Because the NADPH oxidase activity of CaM-free nNOS is directly linked to the autoxidation rate of its reduced flavins (35Roman L.J. Martásek P. Miller R.T. de la Harris D.E. Garza M.A. Shea T.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14533-14536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), our results establish that electronegative charged residues at the FNR/FMN module interface are required to minimize flavin autoxidation and the consequent generation of reduced oxygen species by nNOS. NO Synthesis and NADPH Oxidation by the CaM-bound Mutants—Eleven of the 18 FMN surface mutants had a 30% or greater reduction in their NO synthesis activities relative to the wild-type activity (Fig. 6, left panel). The mutants with the lowest NO synthesis activities were, in decreasing order, E762R and E816A (40% of the wild-type activity), E816R and E819A (32% of the wild-type activity), and E762A (21% of the wild-type activity). Substitution of three of the residues (Glu762, Glu816, and Glu819) with Ala or Arg diminished NO synthesis activity, whereas substitution with Asn either had little effect or, in one case (E762N), doubled the NO synthesis activity relative to the wild-type activity. The NO synthesis activities of the complementary FNR surface mutants R1229N and R1229A were 23% and 34% that of wild-type nNOS, respectively. Thus, charged residues at the FNR/FMN module interface are important for maintaining NO synthesis activity in nNOS. Fig. 6 (right panel) reports the NADPH oxidation rates during NO synthesis from l-Arg by the mutants and wild-type nNOS. Several mutants had higher rates of NADPH oxidation despite their lower rates of NO synthesis. Wild-type nNOS oxidized 2.0 molecules of NADPH/molecule of NO formed, which is close to the theoretical minimum of 1.5 (1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Andrew P.J. Mayer B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The E819A, E819R, and E762A mutants had NADPH:NO stoichiometric ratios of greater than 3.5, indicating an NADPH consumption significantly beyond that required for NO synthesis. The NADPH oxidation rates of the R1229N and R1229A FNR surface mutants were also in excess of that required for NO synthesis. Thus, the electrostatic charge of these residues appears to be important for coupling NADPH consumption to NO synthesis. Rates of Heme Reduction—To examine mutational effects on electron transfer, we measured the rate of heme reduction in single turnover reactions that were run in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer at 10 °C. Reactions were initiated by mixing CaM-bound enzymes with excess NADPH under a N2/CO atmosphere. For comparison, we also ran reactions in which heme reduction was triggered by mixing Ca2+ and CaM with each NADPH-reduced enzyme. The rates of heme reduction were determined by following the absorbance increase at 444 nm versus time, which tracked formation of the ferrous heme-CO complex. As shown in Fig. 7, all of the mutants had slower heme reduction rates compared with wild-type nNOS, consistent with many of them having lower NO synthesis activities. In some cases, the heme reduction rate did not correspond well with the NO synthesis rate. This was most prominent for the Glu762 mutants, which had slower than expected rates of heme reduction and, to a lesser extent, for the Glu816 and Glu790 mutants. The heme reduction rates for the R1229A and R1229N FNR surface mutants were also slower than that of wild-type nNOS, consistent with their lower NO synthesis activities. Our results indicate that the electronegative surface patch of the FMN module plays a significant role in controlling electron transfer and catalysis in nNOS. Mutations that neutralized or reversed the electronegative charge of six surface residues on the FMN module altered cytochrome c reduction, flavin autoxidation, heme reduction, and NO synthesis by nNOS. In general, the largest effects were seen in the Glu762 mutants, followed by the Glu816, Glu819, and Asp813 mutants and then the others (Glu790 and Glu789), with the exact rank order often depending on whether CaM was bound or not and what aspect of catalysis was being considered. Structure-Function Relationships—The six acidic residues are only partly conserved among NOS enzymes and related flavoproteins (Fig. 8). Remarkably, Glu762 is conserved among NOS enzymes but is replaced by neutral residues in related flavoproteins. Thus, Glu762 appears to"

Strikingly, animals lacking NCAM and the polysialyltransferases appear normal, suggesting that the presence of polysialic acid is critical for down-regulating NCAM-dependent adhesion at specific times during brain development (15Weinhold B.

The limited number of polysialylated proteins suggests that polysialylation is protein-specific and like other post-translational modifications of this type may require the polysialyltransferases to recognize their substrates by engaging in an initial protein-protein interaction. For example, the phosphotransferase, which catalyzes the first biosynthetic step in the synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate tag for enzyme trafficking to the lysosome (23Dahms N.M. Lobel P.

NCAM140 is a transmembrane protein that contains five immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and two fibronectin type III (Fn III) repeats in its extracellular domain (Fig. 1, FL-NCAM) (32Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Sem. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis demonstrated that the first Fn III repeat of NCAM (FN1) is necessary for the polysialylation of the N-glycans on the adjacent immunoglobulin (Ig) domain (this is the fifth Ig domain-Ig5) (31Close B.E.

We found that the second Fn III repeat (FN2) cannot replace the first, suggesting that the polysialyltransferases recognize unique features of FN1 (30Mendiratta S.S. Sekulic N. Lavie A. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32340-32348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Modeling the structure of FN1 using the NMR structure of rat NCAM FN2 revealed a putative acidic patch on the surface of FN1 (Asp511, Glu512, Glu514) that is not present on FN2 (30Mendiratta S.S. Sekulic N. Lavie A. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32340-32348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Replacement of these negatively charged residues with positively charged arginine residues eliminated polysialylation of a truncated NCAM protein consisting of Ig5, FN1, the transmembrane region, and cytoplasmic tail (NCAM4) and full-length NCAM (FL-NCAM) (see Fig. 1 for a description of these proteins) (30Mendiratta S.S. Sekulic N. Lavie A. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32340-32348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, replacement of the acidic residues with alanine residues eliminated the polysialylation of NCAM4, but not of FL-NCAM. Additional experiments suggested that the absence of the FN2 domain in NCAM4, and the resulting change in positioning of the NCAM4 Ig5-FN1 unit relative to the membrane-associated polysialyltransferases, lead to a weaker and/or less extensive polysialyltransferase-NCAM4 interaction (30Mendiratta S.S. Sekulic N. Lavie A. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32340-32348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As a result, even alanine replacement mutants were able to impair polysialylation of NCAM4. These studies suggest that the FN1 acidic patch may be part of a larger interaction region that is critical for the polysialyltransferase-NCAM interaction and subsequent NCAM polysialylation. In this work we sought to determine the structure of the FN1 repeat from human NCAM in an effort to confirm the existence of the acidic patch and to determine whether other unique features of this domain contribute to recognition and polysialylation of NCAM. We have solved the x-ray crystal structure of human NCAM FN1 and found that in addition to an acidic surface patch consisting of Asp497, Asp511, Glu512, and Glu514,it possesses a unique α-helix that links strands 4 and 5 of its β-sandwich structure. Replacement of this eight-amino acid linker with an analogous linker from another Fn III repeat does not eliminate polysialylation, but changes the sites of polysialylation from N-glycans modifying Ig5 to O-glycans modifying FN1. Our data are consistent with a model in which an Ig5-FN1 interaction involving the FN1 α-helix is necessary for the correct positioning of N-glycans on Ig5 for polysialylation.

Construction of FN1 Bacterial Expression Construct—A PCR fragment of FN1 cDNA encoding amino acids 487-590 was cloned into the pET14b bacterial expression vector (Novagen) in the NdeI and BamHI sites. This expression vector inserts a His6 tag and thrombin cleavage site at the N terminus of the FN1 domain. After cleavage of the His6 tag, our constructs contained 4 additional N-terminal residues (Gly-Ser-His-Met). Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of Human NCAM FN1—BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli were transformed with the above vector, grown to an optical density of 0.6-0.8 at which time the culture was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow overnight at 22 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. Ultracentrifugation yielded the supernatant that was loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap™ Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) charged with nickel ions. The protein was cleaved from the His6-tag on the column with thrombin, collected, and concentrated to 4 mg/ml. Crystallization experiments conducted with several Hampton Research screens provided multiple hits. One of those hits was optimized to produce small cubic-shaped crystals (50 μm to an edge) at 0.3 m CaCl2, 17% PEG 3350, 10% PEG 400 (the latter only present in the drop). X-ray Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Modeling of the ΔHelix-TT Protein—Diffraction data to 1.7-Å resolution were collected from a single crystal frozen in liquid nitrogen using beam line A1 at CHESS. Processing was accomplished with XDS (33Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). Initial molecular replacement using several Fn III repeat crystal structures as search models was unsuccessful. A second attempt for a search model was done with a BLAST experiment as implemented in the Protein Similarity Search module of the DS Modeling 1.1 program (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). This search indicated that the first Fn III repeat of human Roundabout homolog 2 (KIAA1568 protein, Protein Data Bank ID 1UEM) had the lowest Expectancy value at 3.2e-003 and hence the best sequence alignment hit. A molecular replacement search was done with all 20 NMR solution structures after truncation of the first 13 and last 4 residues for all structures. Molecular replacement was done automatically using the AMoRe software (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. 1992; A50: 157-163Google Scholar) as implemented in the HT-XMR module of DS Modeling 1.1. From the molecular replacement search of all 20 solution structures, 7 NMR structures gave the correct orientation, but the molecular replacement search using structure number 13 gave the highest quality solution. Full model building and refinement of the FN1 protein was done using the XBUILD (35Oldfield T.J. Acta Crystallogr. 2001; D57: 82-94Google Scholar) and CNX (Accelrys) modules, respectively, as implemented in DS Modeling 1.1 (Table 1). A final round of refinement done using REFMAC5 (36Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

We could model all residues present in our FN1 construct, plus three additional N-terminal residues that remain after cleaving of the His6 tag with thrombin. In addition, we modeled 97 water molecules and a single sodium ion observed to bridge two crystallographically related FN1 monomers. The accuracy of the model was verified by inspecting simulated annealing omit maps as implemented in CNS (37Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

This loop substitutes the residues that form the helix (residues Asp543-Gly550) with a tandem of threonine residues as is present in the Roundabout homolog 2 protein. Construction of FL-NCAM Mutant cDNAs—NCAM(AAA) and NCAM7(AAA) mutants were generated by simultaneously replacing Asp511, Glu512, and Glu514 with alanine using the primers 5′-GCAGTTTGCTGCACCAGCGGCCACAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTGGCCGCTGGTGCAGCAAACTGC-3′. NCAM(RRR) and NCAM7(RRR) mutants were generated by using the primers 5′-GCAGTTTCGTCGACCACGGGCCACAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGTGGCCCGTGGTCGACGAAACTGC-3′. The Δhelix-TT change was generated in FL-NCAM and NCAM(AAA) by replacing Asp543-Gly550 with two threonine residues using the primers 5′-CAAGTGGTATGATACTACTATCGTCACCATC-3′ and 5′-GATGGTGACGATAGTAGTATCATACCACTTG-3′. The Δhelix-AA proteins were generated in FL-NCAM, NCAM(AAA), NCAM(RRR), and NCAM7 by using primers 5′-CAAGTGGTATGATGCTGCTATCGTCACCATC-3′ and 5′-GATGGTG-ACGATAGCAGCATCATACCACTTG-3′. The Δhelix-AA-T505/516A and Δhelix-AA-T505/516/553A proteins were generated by replacing Thr505, Thr516, and Thr553 sequentially with alanine in the Δhelix-AA protein using primers 5′-CCATACTCCAGCGCAGCCCAGGTGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCACCTGGGCTGCGCTGGAGTATGG-3′ for T505A, 5′-GAACCAGAGGCCGCAGGTGGGGTG-3′, and 5′-CACCCCACCTGCGGCCTCTGGTTC-3′ for T516A, and primers 5′-GATGCTGCTATCGTCGCCATCGTGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCACGATGGCGACGATAGCAGC-ATC-3′ for T553A. All mutation reactions were performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Transfection of COS-1 Cells with NCAM and PST or STX cDNAs—COS-1 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum were plated on 100-mm tissue culture plates and grown in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until 50-70% confluent. Lipofectin transfections were performed according to the protocols provided by Invitrogen. Transfections were done in 3 ml of Opti-MEM 1 using 30 μl of Lipofectin and 10 μg each of FL-NCAM or NCAM mutant cDNAs cloned in the pcDNA 3.1 (V5-His B) expression vector that places the His6 and V5 epitope tags at the C termini of the protein, and PST or STX cDNA that were cloned in the pcDNA 3.1 (no tag) expression vector. Cells were harvested 18-24-h post-transfection for analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis of NCAM Proteins—COS-1 cells were co-transfected with untagged polysialyltransferase cDNA and V5-tagged NCAM cDNA at a 1:1 ratio, as described above. Following transfection, 7 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the cells. After incubation for 18 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, cells were washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS). NCAM proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using 3 μl of anti-V5 epitope tag antibody and 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose, as previously described (30Mendiratta S.S.

PNGase F treatment was performed following immunoprecipitation and while the immune complexes were still bound to the protein A-Sepharose beads. Briefly, two identical samples were resuspended in 77 μl of dH2O, 10 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μl of 10× reaction buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5). PNGase F (3 μl, 1500 units) was added to one sample of the pair and both were incubated for 18 h with shaking at 37 °C. The samples (including the protein A-Sepharose beads) were then resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, heated for 10 min at 65 °C (to preserve polysialic acid), and directly loaded into the gel wells. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (5% separating gel, 3% stacking gel). To evaluate protein expression, a 30-μl aliquot of each cell lysate was removed before immunoprecipitation. Following the addition of Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, the sample was incubated at 110 °C for 10 min to remove polysialic acid and electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5% separating gel and 5% stacking gel). Following electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 16 h at 500 mA. To detect polysialylated proteins, membranes were incubated with the OL28 anti-polysialic acid antibody (IgM) in blocking buffer 1 (2% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM diluted 1:8000 in blocking buffer 2 (5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20). For immunoblotting of the cell lysate aliquots, the anti-V5 epitope tag antibody was diluted 1:5000 and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was diluted 1:8000 in blocking buffer 2. Immunoblots were developed using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak Bio-Max MR film at room temperature. NCAM FN1 Possesses a Unique α-Helix That Links Strands 4 and 5 of Its β-Sandwich Structure—Fn III repeats contain ∼100 amino acids and adopt the Ig-like β-sandwich fold (38Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). This domain is present in proteins with diverse functions such as cell adhesion proteins, extracellular matrix proteins, cytokine receptors, and muscle proteins. The Fn III repeat superfamily has 9037 members in the current Pfam data base (39Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nuc. Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar), and members share as low as 5% sequence identity. Our interest in the FN1 of NCAM originates from its critical role in mediating the specificity of NCAM polysialylation. We propose that interactions between the polysialyltransferase and the NCAM FN1 domain lead to the correct anchoring of the enzyme and subsequent polysialylation of N-glycans modifying the adjacent immunoglobulin domain (Ig5). Previously, we built a homology model of FN1 that revealed an acidic patch composed of three carboxylic acid residues on its surface (Asp511, Glu512, Glu514) (Fig. 1b, FN1) (30Mendiratta S.S. Sekulic N. Lavie A. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32340-32348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Replacement of these three residues with alanine or arginine slightly decreased or eliminated the polysialylation of FLNCAM, respectively (Fig. 1b, Acidic Patch Mutants) (30Mendiratta S.S. Sekulic N. Lavie A. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32340-32348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To verify the existence of this structural feature, we solved the crystal structure of this domain to 1.7-Å resolution. Our experimentally derived structure confirmed the presence of the acidic patch, and showed that it includes a fourth carboxylic acid residue (Asp497) (Fig. 2). In an additional experiment, we found that replacing all four acidic patch residues with alanine did not further decrease the recognition and polysialylation of FL-NCAM (data not shown). This suggested that sequences beyond the acidic patch play a role in enzyme recognition and polysialylation. The structure of NCAM FN1 also revealed an α-helix that links strands 4 and 5 of the β-sandwich fold (Fig. 2). Analysis of our model using the DALI server (40Holm L.-E. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) indicates that this helical segment is unique among known Fn III repeats. Being in close proximity to the acidic patch, we surmised that the α-helix could be a structural element important for recognition of NCAM by the polysialyltransferases. To test this, we designed a mutant where we replaced the α-helix with the short loop (Thr-Thr) that links strands 4 and 5 in the Fn III domain of the Roundabout homolog 2 (Protein Data Bank ID 1UEM), which is the model we exploited for obtaining the molecular replacement solution (Fig. 1, Δhelix-TT). Overlay of the two Fn III domains indicated that these two residues would suffice as a linker between strands 4 and 5 without perturbing the FN1 β-sandwich fold (Fig. 2d). Replacement of the FN1 α-Helix Does Not Eliminate Recognition or Polysialyla"

The RNA transport element (RTE) identified in mouse retrotransposons is functionally equivalent to constitutive transport element of Type D retroviruses, yet does not bind directly to the mRNA export receptor NXF1. Here, we report that the RNA-binding motif protein 15 (RBM15) recognizes RTE directly and specifically in vitro and stimulates export and expression of RTE-containing reporter mRNAs in vivo. Tethering of RBM15 to a reporter mRNA showed that RBM15 acts by promoting mRNA export from the nucleus. We also found that RBM15 binds to NXF1 and the two proteins cooperate in stimulating RTE-mediated mRNA export and expression. Thus, RBM15 is a novel mRNA export factor and is part of the NXF1 pathway. We propose that RTE evolved as a high affinity RBM15 ligand to provide a splicing-independent link to NXF1, thereby ensuring efficient nuclear export and expression of retrotransposon transcripts.

Splicing changes the mRNP protein composition, allowing NXF1-p15 to bind and export to occur, whereas the pre-mRNPs are normally retained in the nucleus until completely spliced (10Huang Y.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). In particular, a set of proteins known as exon junction complex (EJC) is deposited onto mRNP as a result of splicing (14Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), providing critical determinants for the subsequent metabolic steps, including nuclear export, quality control, cytoplasmic trafficking, and translation (15Tange T.O. Nott A. Moore M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). EJC consists of a stably bound core composed of eIF4AIII, Y14-Magoh, and MLN51/Barentsz that serves as a platform for a multitude of other EJC and EJC-associated factors that are bound more transiently. EJC is thought to commit the spliced mRNPs to nuclear export by providing binding sites for the NXF1-p15 export receptor. In one scenario, the EJC factor UAP56 recruits Aly/REF proteins, which bind directly to NXF1-p15, which in turn tethers the export substrate to the NPC (16Le Hir H. Gatfield D. Izaurralde E.

Alternatively, NXF1 may assemble with the spliced mRNP via interactions with non-EJC factors such as SR proteins: SRp20 and 9G8 (22Huang Y. Yario T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Upon NXF1-p15-dependent targeting to NPC, such complexes are translocated to the cytoplasm by a yet unknown mechanism. NXF1 is a conserved export receptor for cellular mRNAs (1Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Bear J. Patenaude D.J. Felber B.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1762-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Herold A. Teixeira L. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2472-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Proteins of the NXF family can act on nuclear as well as on cytoplasmic mRNA trafficking (26Sasaki M. Takeda E. Takano K.

According to the current model, general mRNA metabolism requires the acquisition of an export signal as a result of splicing, whereas pre-mRNA is generally retained in the nucleus due both to the lack of active export and to factors retaining the pre-mRNA in the nucleus. Retroviral transcripts are a notable exception from this rule, because the unspliced transcript encodes the Gag-pol polyprotein and also serves as viral genomic RNAs, and, therefore needs to be exported prior to splicing. To overcome the general requirement of splicing before export, simian Type D retroviruses and some retroelements utilize the constitutive transport element (CTE) (29Bray M. Prasad S. Dubay J.W.

RTE is functionally analogous to CTE, yet structurally unrelated, and does not bind to NXF1 with high affinity. In this work, we report the identification of the factor that directly promotes RTE function. We report that the RNA-binding motif protein 15 (RBM15) recognizes RTE RNA specifically in vitro and activates export and expression of RTE-containing reporter mRNAs in vivo. RBM15 also binds to NXF1, and these factors act cooperatively in promoting RTE-mediated expression. Thus, RBM15 is a novel component of the NXF pathway.

RBM15 C-terminally tagged with HA was cloned into cDNA3. RBM15 C-terminally FLAG-tagged was cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma). N-tagged RBM15 proteins were generated by replacing NXF1 cDNA in pN-TAP plasmid (39Wiegand H.L. Lu S. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11327-11332Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). RBM15-S was obtained from S. Morris, and the FLAG tag was removed. RBM15-L and the isoforms initiating at the AUG residue 45 were generated by PCR. All RBM15 plasmids were verified by sequencing. Isolation of Proteins Binding to RTE RNA—Biotinylated RTE and CTE RNA bound on streptavidin beads (Dynal) were used as pull-down bait (50Zolotukhin A.S. Michalowski D. Bear J. Smulevitch S.V.

The immobilized RNAs were incubated with micrococcal endonuclease-treated nuclear HeLa cell extract in buffer RBB (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100) with 300 mm NaCl (RBB-300) supplemented with 4 μg/ml rRNA and 2 μg/μl tRNA in 400-μl reactions at 30 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed 6× in RBB-300, and the bound proteins were eluted from the RNAs in 1 m NaCl, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by silver staining. In-gel Tryptic Digestion, Nano-HPLC Separation, and NSIMS Analysis—Protein bands were excised from gels and digested with trypsin as described (51Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal.

The peptides were separated by nano-HPLC (LC Packings), introduced through a nanospray ionization source to an ion-trap mass spectrometer (LCQ-Deca, ThermoFinnigan) and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry, as described (51Hellman U.

Default score values used as cut-off parameters during TurboSequest searches were as follows, Xcorr > 1.0, ΔCn > 0.1, Sp > 500, and Rsp < 10, and the peptide mass tolerance was 1.0. RNA Transcription and Gel-mobility Shift—The 32P-labeled RTE and CTE RNAs (34Nappi F. Schneider R. Zolotukhin A. Smulevitch S. Michalowski D. Bear J. Felber B. Pavlakis G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4558-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were prepared as in a previous study (53Lindtner S. Felber B.K. Kjems J. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and unlabeled RNAs were synthesized using MEGAScript-T7 (Ambion, Austin, TX). 10 nm cold RTE or CTE RNA was added to 10 fmol of radiolabeled RTE or CTE RNA, respectively, to keep the RNA concentration constant for the different probes. Binding reactions were performed in 10 μl of RBB-250 in the presence of 2 μg of tRNA. After 30 min at room temperature, 1 μl of a solution containing 0.2 mg/ml heparin and 0.05% bromphenol blue was added to the reactions, following 10 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded onto a 6% (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 50 mm Tris-Borate, pH 8.8, 0.5 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C, and complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Microscopy—Human 293 and 293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate technique. Human HeLa-derived HLtat cells were transfected with SuperFect (Qiagen). For indirect immunofluorescence, the fixed cells (54Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were incubated with murine anti-HA antibody (Covance) at a 1:1000 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 0.2% bovine serum albumin, followed by Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For the shuttling assay, transfected HeLa cells were mixed with an excess of untransfected cells, and, after pretreatment with cycloheximide, the cells were fused using polyethylene glycol (54Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For cotransfection experiments, reporter plasmids were used at 1 μg, in the absence or presence of 0.5 μg of plasmids expressing export factors. All transfections contained 0.2 μg of GFP (pFRED143 or pFRED25) or SEAP expression plasmids serving as internal control for efficiency of transfection and poly-A RNA preparation. Two days later, Gag (HIV p24gag antigen capture assay, Zeptometrix), SEAP (Phospha-light kit, Applied Biosystems), CAT, and GFP fluorescence (54Bear J. Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tabernero C. Hudson E.A. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6306-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were measured. Nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA was prepared (25Zolotukhin A.S. Tan W. Bear J. Smulevitch S. Felber B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3935-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The RNAs were analyzed on Northern blots (42Zolotukhin A.S. Felber B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11356-11360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using probes spanning the GFP or CAT coding regions. For RNA interference experiments, 2 × 105 HeLa cells were transfected with 10 mm SMART pool siRNA (Dharmacon) targeted to RBM15 (GGACAGAGGTGATCGAGAT, GAAGATAGAAGCTGTGTAT, GGACACCACCCTTACTATA, and GGTGATAGTTGGGCATATA) or non-targeting siRNA control (Dharmacon) using HiPerFect (Qiagen). One day later, the cells were re-transfected with the reporter plasmids using SuperFect (Qiagen). Culture media were collected 48 h later, and Gag and SEAP were measured. To control for the efficiency of RBM15 knockdowns, the cells were transfected with an RBM15-FLAG-expressing plasmid on day 1 and then transfected with either RBM15 siRNA pools or siRNA control pool on day 2. Cells were harvested in RBB-400 buffer on day 4, and the lysates were analyzed on immunoblots using murine anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-murine antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). RNA interference pool-treated untransfected cells were analyzed using anti-RBM15 antiserum (ProteinTech Group, Inc., Chicago, IL) and anti-β actin antibody (Sigma). The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL plus Western blotting Detection System, Amersham Biosciences) and autography. Reverse transcription-PCR of the endogenously expressed alternatively spliced RBM15 mRNAs was performed on total poly-A containing mRNAs isolated from HeLa and 293 cells using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Applied Science), and the PCR products were sequenced. Recombinant Protein Expression and Protein Analysis—Human RBM15 was produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) from pGEX-6P-3-RBM15. Recombinant soluble GST-RBM15 protein was isolated after freezing the bacterial pellets in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 160 mm NaCl and protease inhibitor (Pi, Roche Applied Science) at -70 °C for 30 min. The lysates were treated with DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and cleared by centrifugation. Glutathione-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) were added, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times, and the recombinant protein was eluted using a standard glutathione-containing buffer. Protein concentrations were estimated on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. RNA Export from Xenopus Oocyte Nuclei—The preparation of capped RTE and CTE-containing adenovirus precursor RNA, U1ΔSm RNA, and U6Δss RNA, unlabeled RTE, CTE, and CTEm36 RNAs and oocyte nuclei microinjections were described previously (34Nappi F.

RNA was extracted from a pool of five oocytes after proteinase K digestion, and equivalents of one-half oocyte were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. In Vitro Protein Binding Assays—Metabolically labeled reticulocyte-produced proteins were synthesized in a coupled transcription/translation system (TnT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega) and used in binding reactions containing ∼0.5 μg of E. coli-produced GST-tagged proteins (27Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Tretyakova I. Bear J. Lindtner S. Smulevitch S.V. Felber B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3855-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The binding was performed in 200 μl of RBB-400 buffer in the presence of 100 μg of RNase A. Following incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the beads were washed three times with binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation Assays—Complexes of epitope-tagged proteins were immunopurified from transiently transfected 293 cells. Typically, ∼3 × 106 cells were extracted with 500 μlof RBB-400 buffer. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C for 30 min in 200 μl of RBB-400 buffer in the absence or presence of RNase A using anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). The precipitates were washed six times in RBB-400 buffer supplemented with 2 m urea and analyzed on Western immunoblots using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated HA-antibodies (Roche Applied Science), and the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL plus Western blotting Detection System, Amersham Biosciences) and autography. Identification of RBM15 as an RTE Binding Factor—Immobilized, biotinylated RTE RNA was used to identify putative binding factors from HeLa nuclear extracts in pull-down experiments. CTE RNA was included as control in a parallel experiment (Fig. 1A). These binding conditions enabled the specific pull-down of NXF1 with CTE RNA but not with inactive mutant CTEm36 RNA, lacking the NXF1 binding sites (3Grüter P. von Tabernero C. Kobbe C. Schmitt C.

Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5998-6011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), confirming the binding specificity (data not shown). Four candidate RTE-specific binding factors were identified by microsequencing (Fig. 1A), which are RNA helicase A (SwissProt accession number: O70133), RBM15 (Q96T37), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (P38159), and U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein A (P09012). An additional band at ∼100 kDa could not be identified because of contamination with bovine serum albumin and was not further studied. Subsequent experiments did not support specific interactions of RNA helicase A, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G, and U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein A with RTE RNA (data not shown). In contrast, RBM15 showed specific and functional interaction with RTE as detailed below. RBM15 belongs to the spen (split end) protein family and is conserved in eukaryotes from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans (57Ariyoshi M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but its function had not been investigated previously. Characteristic of this gene family is the presence of three conserved RNA recognition motifs at the N terminus and the SPOC (spen paralogue and orthologue C-terminal) domain at the C terminus. Preferential Binding of RBM15 to RTE in Vitro—We expressed recombinant RBM15 (isoform AE+S, see Fig. 2A) in bacteria and employed electrophoresis mobility shift assays to examine binding of RBM15 to RTE RNA (Fig. 1B). Radiolabeled RTE (left panel) or CTE (right panel) RNAs were incubated with increasing amounts of bacterially produced GST-tagged RBM15. Approximately 50% binding of RTE RNA was observed at 15 nm of RBM15 (left panel, lane 6), whereas no complex formation with CTE RNA was detectable (right panel, lanes 9-15), except for a weak band detectable by using the highest concentration of RBM15 tested (50 nm, lane 16). These data show that recombinant RBM15 binds directly to RTE RNA, in agreement with the finding from the pull-down assay (Fig. 1A), and demonstrate that RBM15 interacts preferentially with RTE.

https://openalex.org/W1964984245,"Mutations in Drosophila neuralized (Dneur) result in a variety of developmental defects that closely resemble those of Notch mutants and other Notch pathway mutants. However, mice with disrupted neur1 do not show any aberrant cell fate specifications in neurogenesis and somitogenesis. Thus, we speculated that other vertebrate neur homolog(s) might compensate for loss of the neur gene. Here, we report the paralog of mouse Neur1, named Neuralized-2 (Neur2), which is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) that interacts with and ubiquitinates Delta. Both murine Neur1 and Neur2 have similar degrees of homology to DNeur, and neur2 is expressed in patterns similar to those of neur1 in embryos, suggesting potential functional redundancy. Interestingly, two distinct classes of E3 ligases, Mind bomb-1 (Mib1) and Neur2, have cooperative but distinct roles in Delta endocytosis to Hrs-positive vesicles, i.e. Mib1 functions in the initial step of Delta endocytosis, and Neur2 is required for targeting endocytosed Delta to Hrs-positive vesicles. Thus, our study provides a new insight into how distinct E3 ligases work together in the endocytic pathways for Notch signaling.

Thus, our study provides a new insight into how distinct E3 ligases work together in the endocytic pathways for Notch signaling. The Notch pathway is a signaling module that is conserved in all metazoans and has been implicated in a variety of developmental processes (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). It is best known for its role in selecting cells to become neuroblasts or sensory organ precursors in Drosophila by the process of lateral inhibition, in which cells adopting a neural fate inhibit their neighbors from adopting a similar fate (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 2Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Simpson P. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The core components in Notch signaling include the ligands, the receptor (Notch), and the transcription factor (Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H))) in Drosophila. Notch signaling is initiated by the interaction of the Notch receptor with its ligands (3Lai E.C. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 4Schweisguth F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R129-R138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions induce proteolytic cleavage (S2) of the Notch receptors, which results in membrane-bound Notch fragments (5Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israel A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). After the S2 cleavage, the remaining receptor fragments are cleaved at a third site (S3) within the membrane by γ-secretase complexes (6De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 7Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The released intracellular fragments of Notch (Notch intracellular domain) translocate to the nucleus to form transcriptional activator complexes with Su(H)/CBF1/RBP-J. These complexes activate Notch target genes such as Hairy/E(spl)-related basic helix-loop-helix repressors (8Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Although much is known about Notch signal transduction after the receptor undergoes the ligand-dependent S2 cleavage, the mechanism by which the Notch ligands engage Notch receptors and trigger their cleavage is less understood. Recent studies demonstrated that the endocytosis of Notch ligands in the signal-sending cells is required for the effective activation of Notch signaling (9Parks A.L. Klueg K.M. Stout J.R. Muskavitch M.A. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Key components for the endocytosis of Notch ligands have been identified in Drosophila, zebrafish, and mice; these are Neuralized (Neur), Mind bomb (Mib)-1/2, Liquid facets/epsin, and auxilin (10Pavlopoulos E.

Recent studies have suggested that DNeur is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) that promotes the internalization and degradation of Delta to activate the Notch signaling pathway (10Pavlopoulos E.

However, mice with a disrupted neur1 (neur1 was heretofore known as neuralized in mice) gene are viable; they do not show any Notch-related phenotype during embryogenesis but do exhibit defects as adults, including impaired olfactory discrimination, hypersensitivity to ethanol, and abnormalities both in axoneme organization in the spermatozoa and in mammary gland maturation during pregnancy (25Vollrath B.

Thus, we speculate that other vertebrate neur homolog(s) might compensate for loss of the neur gene in mammals based on the conservation between Drosophila and mammalian Notch signaling. Here, we report two Neuralized ortholog/paralogs, Neur1 and Neuralized-2 (Neur2), both of which have similar degrees of homology to DNeur. We show that Neur2 is another E3 ligase that ubiquitinates the Notch ligand Delta. The expression patterns of neur2 in embryos were similar to those of neur1, suggesting a possible compensatory role of Neur2 to Neur1. In contrast to DNeur, which promotes the internalization and degradation of Delta, Neur2 alone does not induce the endocytosis of Delta. It is intriguing that Neur2 readily leads to the endocytosis of Delta to the Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate)-positive vesicles in the presence of Mib1, suggesting that Mib1 and Neur2 work cooperatively in the endocytic pathway of Delta. Our results indicate a novel functional relationship between the E3 ligases of Delta, Mib1, and Neur2. Cloning of the Mouse neur2 Gene and Generation of Mutations in the Neur2 RING Finger Domain—PCR was carried out using mouse brain cDNA as the template and oligonucleotide primers designed to obtain the open reading frame of the mouse neur2 gene. The PCR for neur2 yielded a product of ∼1641 bp, which was cloned into the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged pcDNA vector (Invitrogen) or the pEGFPN3 vector (Clontech). The neur2 mutants with mutations in the RING finger domain were generated using DpnI-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. All cloned cDNA vectors were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. In Situ Hybridization—For whole-mount in situ hybridization, mouse embryos were isolated in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and processed following previously described procedures (16Koo B.-K. Yoon K.-J. Yoo K.-W. Lim H.-S. Song R. So J.-H. Kim C.-H. Kong Y.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22335-22342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In situ probes for mouse neur1 and neur2 were cloned into pBluescript II KS vectors and synthesized with EcoRI-cleaved vectors by T7 RNA polymerase (Fermentas). The PCR primers for the mouse neur1 probe were GCCGAGACCATCTTCATCA and CAGGAGTAGCACAGGCACAT. The PCR primers for the mouse neur2 probe were CTTCGCTGACACGCTGAC and ATTCTGATGCTGAGGACGAC. For in situ hybridizations with zebrafish embryos, zebrafish ath1 (zath1) was linearized with BamHI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase for the digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe (27Kim C.-H. Bae Y.K. Yamanaka Y. Yamashita S. Shimizu T. Fujii R. Park H.C. Yeo S.Y. Huh T.L. Hibi M. Hirano T. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 239: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as described (28Thisse C. Thisse B. Schilling T.F. Postlethwait J.H. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 1203-1215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Two probes were generated to detect the N- and C-terminal regions of Neur2. The PCR primers for the N-terminal probe (5′-probe) were Neur2NL (TCTGCAACGGAGTCACCT) and Neur2NR (GTCGATGAGTGCCCAGAGT). The PCR primers for the C-terminal probe (3′-probe) were Neur2CL (AGGATGACAGCGATTCAGAC) and Neur2CR (CTACGGCCTGTAGATCTTG). For expression analysis in adult mouse tissues, the MTN™ mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was hybridized with both probes. Transfections and Western Blotting—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with appropriate amounts of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). At 24-48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Western blotting was performed as described (16Koo B.-K. Yoon K.-J. Yoo K.-W. Lim H.-S. Song R. So J.-H. Kim C.-H. Kong Y.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22335-22342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—HEK 293A cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA/10-cm plate and then resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (16Koo B.-K. Yoon K.-J. Yoo K.-W. Lim H.-S. Song R. So J.-H. Kim C.-H. Kong Y.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22335-22342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-ubiquitin (Ub) antibody (clone P4D1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Promega Corp.) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). In Vitro and in Vivo Ubiquitination Assays—In vitro ubiquitination assays were carried out using ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1; 250 nm; Calbiochem), glutathione S-transferase (GST)-UbcH5a (2 μm; Calbiochem), and N-terminally His-tagged ubiquitin (100 μm; Sigma) in ubiquitination assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm creatine phosphate, and 15 units of creatine phosphokinase). The purified GST-fused Neur1 and Neur2 RING finger domains and their mutants were added to the reactions. After incubation at room temperature for up to 90 min, the reactions were analyzed by Western blotting to detect ubiquitinated proteins. To detect ubiquitination activity in vivo, HEK 293A cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA/10-cm plate. MG132 (2 μm) was added 24 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested 24 h later. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (16Koo B.-K. Yoon K.-J. Yoo K.-W. Lim H.-S. Song R. So J.-H.

Subcellular Localization Analysis—Three COS-7 cell lines were analyzed: one natural and two engineered. Of the engineered cell lines, one line overproduced Xenopus Delta (XD), and the other line did not. These were generated by infecting cells with murine stem cell virus carrying XD and murine stem cell virus that did not, respectively, and then using puromycin for 6 days to select for stable integrants. The three cell lines were transfected with various plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 3% sucrose for 30 min at 4 °C. The fixed cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution (3% skim milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) and stained with mouse anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in 3% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated with either Alexa 546- or Alexa 350-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and stained with Hoechst dye (10 μg/ml) for 2 min. After three washes, the cells were mounted on glass slides and analyzed with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. All images were collected using an Olympus DP70 camera. Retro-virus-mediated gene transfer was accomplished using a retroviral expression system (Clontech) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Zebrafish Maintenance and mRNA Microinjections—Zebrafish were raised and maintained under standard conditions. The allele of mibta52b was used as the mib1 mutant (13Itoh M. Kim C.-H. Palardy G.

The mouse neur2 cDNA was subcloned into the pCS2+ vector, and the sense RNA encoding full-length mouse neur2 was transcribed in vitro using an SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The synthesized neur2 mRNA was microinjected into one- or two-cell stage embryos. The amount of mRNA (∼100 pg/embryo) injected into the embryos was estimated visually from the injection volume using a hemocytometer. Neur2 Is a Neur1 Paralog—The Drosophila and Xenopus Neur proteins are E3 ligases that are essential components of Notch signaling (10Pavlopoulos E. Pitsouli C. Klueg K.M.

By searching the expressed sequence tag and genomic data bases, we identified a neur paralog, neuralized-2 (neur2; GenBank™ accession number DQ839448), in mice. To investigate the function of Neur2, its cDNA was cloned and amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse brain RNA. Mouse Neur1 and Neur2 have 40% base pair identity and 53% similarity in their amino acid sequences, and they also have remarkable resemblance in their domain organization (Fig. 1, A and B). Mouse Neur1 and Neur2 both have two Neuralized homology repeat (NHR) domains and a RING finger domain (25Vollrath B. Pudney J. Asa S. Leder P. Fitzgerald K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7481-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Ruan Y. Tecott L. Jiang M.M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, comparison between mouse Neur1 and Neur2 subdomains showed a higher degree of homology, with 49, 42, and 70% identities in the NHR1, NHR2, and RING finger domains, respectively (data not shown). Drosophila has a neur gene without known paralogs. Xenopus Neur has 27% identity to DNeur (Fig. 1D) and shares functional similarity (29Deblandre G.A. Lai E.C. Kintner C. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 795-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that Xenopus Neur might be a DNeur ortholog, albeit we cannot exclude the possibility of unidentified Xenopus Neur ortholog(s). To test whether Neur1 and Neur2 are the ortholog and paralog of DNeur, respectively, we compared sequence identity and similarity. The protein sequence identities of Neur1 and Neur2 to DNeur are almost equal: 26% over the full length and 33-48% within domains (Fig. 1B), which raises the question of whether Neur2 is a paralog or another ortholog of DNeur. In examination of other species, we found a putative neur2 gene in zebrafish and in human by a genome BLAST search (supplemental Fig. 1), but not in Xenopus because of incomplete genome sequence (Fig. 1C). In the comparison of sequence similarity between species, murine Neur2 has higher homology to the putative zebrafish and human Neur2 proteins than to zebrafish Neur1, Xenopus Neur, and human Neur1. Furthermore, Xenopus Neur has very high homology to Neur1 from zebrafish and humans, suggesting that Xenopus Neur is the ortholog of Neur1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Intriguingly, DNeur has similar identities to both Neur1 and Neur2 in all species examined, suggesting functional similarity of Neur1 and Neur2. Further functional analysis will determine whether Neur2 is a paralog or an ortholog of DNeur. To test the expression patterns in embryos, we analyzed the spatial distribution of neur1 and neur2 transcripts by wholemount in situ hybridization. At embryonic day 10.5, neur1 transcripts were detected in the limb buds and dorsal root ganglia, as reported previously (30Pavlopoulos E. Kokkinaki M. Koutelou E. Mitsiadis T.A. Prinos P. Delidakis C. Kilpatrick M.W. Tsipouras P. Moschonas N.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neur2 was also expressed in the same regions where neur1 transcripts were detected (Fig. 1E). These similar expression patterns of neur1 and neur2 suggest that both Neur1 and Neur2 might be functionally redundant during embryogenesis. Northern blot analyses using 5′- and 3′-probes revealed a 7.5-kb neur2 transcript, which could include its open reading frame (∼1.6 kb). neur2 was expressed at high levels in the brain and kidney and at low levels in the heart (Fig. 1F), whereas neur1 was expressed at high levels in the brain and skeletal muscle (25Vollrath B. Pudney J. Asa S. Leder P. Fitzgerald K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7481-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Ruan Y. Tecott L. Jiang M.M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9907-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The different expression patterns of these two genes suggest distinct roles of Neur1 and Neur2 in adults. Neur2 Functions as an E3 Ligase—Because the Drosophila and Xenopus Neur proteins function as E3 ligases (10Pavlopoulos E. Pitsouli C. Klueg K.M. Muskavitch M.A. Moschonas N.K. Delidakis C. Dev.

Cell. 2001; 1: 795-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we tested whether murine Neur1 and Neur2 also possess similar biochemical activity. Many RING finger domain-containing E3 ligases can mediate auto-ubiquitination, which facilitates degradation by the proteasome (31Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the protein levels of Neur1 and Neur2 in HEK 293A cells using transfection assays. As expected, both HA-Neur1 and HA-Neur2 were hardly detectable (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4). However, when transfected cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (2 μm) for 24 h, the expression levels of both HA-Neur1 and HA-Neur2 were dramatically increased (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 5), suggesting proteasome-dependent degradation of both Neur1 and Neur2. To test whether this degradation is caused by self-ubiquitination through the RING finger domain, HA-Neur1 or HA-Neur2 was expressed in HEK 293A cells in the presence or absence of MG132 and then immunoprecipitated from the lysates with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody to detect Neur1 and Neur2 as well as with anti-Ub antibody (clone P4D1) to detect ubiquitin chains. Although polyubiquitinated Neur1 and Neur2 proteins were observed compared with the mock-transfected control (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5), the ubiquitination was dramatically increased in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 6), suggesting proteasomal degradation of these ubiquitinated proteins. Neur2 contains a RING finger domain that may confer E3 ligase activity. To test this possibility, we generated a RING finger domain deletion mutant (Neur2ΔRING) and two mutant proteins (Neur2 mut1 and mut2) by inducing point mutations of critical residues in the RING finger domain (29Deblandre G.A. Lai E.C. Kintner C. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 795-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The mutations were C494S/C497S in Neur2 mut1 and C509S/H511N in Neur2 mut2 (Fig. 2C). When HEK 293A cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding two HA-tagged Neur2 mutants and Neur2ΔRING, these mutant proteins were expressed at higher levels compared with full-length HA-Neur2 (Fig. 2D, lanes 3-5). These results suggest that the degradation of Neur2 depends on the RING finger domain, which may be important for E3 ligase activity. Next, to investigate the intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity of the Neur2 RING finger domain in vitro, bacterially expressed and purified GST-Neur2 RING finger domain fusion proteins were incubated with E1, ubiquitin carrier protein (E2; UbcH5a), ubiquitin, and ATP. The presence of ubiquitinated substrates was detected by Western blotting. As expected, a typical reaction mixture containing GST-Neur1 RING resulted in a smear of high molecular mass polyubiquitinated substrates (Fig. 2E, lane 2), whereas a similar reaction containing GST was devoid of such activity (lane 1). When GST-Neur2 RING was tested in this assay, we observed robust ubiquitination in an E1- and E2 (UbcH5a)-dependent manner (Fig. 2E, lanes 3-5), indicating that the Neur2 RING finger domain possesses E3 ligase activity. To confirm the E3 ligase activity of the RING finger domain of Neur2, we generated a GST fusion with Neur2 bearing either the C494S/C497S or C509S/H511N mutations and then performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay as described above. These mutant proteins showed no ubiquitination activity (Fig. 2F). Neur2 Interacts with the XD Ligand—DNeur interacts with Delta and ubiquitinates it to target it to the cellular endocytic machinery (10Pavlopoulos E. Pitsouli C. Klueg K.M.

Cell. 2001; 1: 783-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To test whether murine Neur1 and Neur2 also interact with Delta, HA-Neur1 and HA-Neur2 were cotransfected with either Myc-tagged XD or XD without its intracellular domain in HEK 293A cells. HA-Neur2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody to detect the coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged ligands. The results showed that both Neur1 and Neur2 interacted with XD, but not with XD lacking its intracellular domain (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that both Neur1 and Neur2 bind to XD and that the intracellular domain of the Delta ligand is essential for the interaction with murine Neur proteins. To identify the domain of murine Neur2 that interacts with the Delta ligand, XD-Myc was cotransfected with HA-Neur2 or a truncated form of Neur2: the NHR1 domain (amino acids 1-202), the NHR2 domain (amino acids 201-487), the combined NHR1 and NHR2 domains (amino acids 1-487), or the Neur2 RING finger domain (Fig. 3B). All of the Neur2 forms were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody to detect the co-immunoprecipitation of XD-Myc. All of the Neur2 forms except the Neur2 RING finger domain were co-immunoprecipitated with XD-Myc (Fig. 3C), whereas DNeur lacking the first NHR domain failed to interact with Delta (11Lai E.C. Deblandre G.A. Kintner C. Rubin G.M. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 783-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that Neur2 interacts with the intracellular domain of Delta through each NHR domain. Neur2 Interacts with and Ubiquitinates Deltalike-1—Because murine Neur2 binds to XD through its NHR domains and has ubiquitin ligase activity, we tested whether Neur2 also binds to murine Deltalike-1 (Dll1) and ubiquitinates it using the RING finger domain. As expected, both HA-Neur1 and HA-Neur2 interacted with Dll1-Myc (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that Dll1 could be a natural ligand of Neur1 and Neur2. We next examined whether Neur2 promotes ubiquitination of Dll1. Dll1-Myc and the candidate E3 ligases were cotransfected into HEK 293A cells. Dll1-Myc was"

Of the seven different isoforms (designated P2X1-P2X7), P2X5 occurs in humans primarily as a non-functional variant lacking the C-terminal end of the ectodomain and the outer half of the second transmembrane domain. We show that this truncated variant, which results from the splice-skipping of exon 10, is prone to subunit aggregation because the residual transmembrane domain 2 is too short to insert into the membrane. Alleviation of the negative hydrophobic mismatch by the addition of a stretch of moderately hydrophobic residues enabled formation of a second membrane-spanning domain and strictly parallel homotrimerization. Systematic mutagenesis identified only one transmembrane domain 2 residue, Asp355, which supported homotrimerization in a side chain-specific manner. Our results indicate that transmembrane domain 2 formation contributes 2-fold to hP2X5 homotrimerization by tethering the end of the ectodomain to the membrane, thereby topologically restricting conformational mobility, and by intramembrane positioning of Asp355. While transmembrane domain 2 appears to favor assembly by enabling productive subunit interactions in the ectodomain, Asp355 seems to assist by simultaneously driving intramembrane helix interactions. Overall, these results indicate a complex interplay between topology, helix-helix interactions, and oligomerization to achieve a correctly folded structure.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8903-8910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that a trimeric architecture driven by non-covalent intermolecular interactions is a structural hallmark of functional homomeric and heteromeric P2X receptors. The three subunits are thought to arrange circularly, contributing one or both transmembrane domains to form a central cation-conducting pore. The assembly pathway leading to this trimeric structure is not well characterized. The question of which molecular determinants lead to the assembly of subunits into P2X receptors has so far been addressed by examining the ability of deletion mutants and chimeric constructs to associate with full-length P2X subunits in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (7Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22359-22365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Neither the N-nor C-terminal cytoplasmic domain was found to be important for assembly. However, a deletion mutant terminating 25 amino acids before the start of the TM2 domain was unable to interact with either of the wild type subunits or with itself. This suggested that either TM2 or a region immediately upstream of TM2 carried a critical determinant of specific subunit-subunit interactions, although the possibility that the lack of co-assembly was the result of an inadequate secondary or tertiary structure was not ruled out (7Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22359-22365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of both TM2 and the pre-TM2 region in P2X receptor assembly, we utilized the P2X5 isoform, which occurs in humans predominantly as a natural deletion mutant (designated hP2X Δ328-3495) and lacks much of the TM2 and pre-TM2 regions as a result of the splicing-out of exon 10 (8Le K.T. Paquet M. Nouel D. Babinski K. Seguela P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The hP2X Δ328-3495 cDNA does not encode functional channels, but a receptor chimera consisting of the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the human and the rat P2X5 subunits, respectively, has been expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and is functional (8Le K.T. Paquet M. Nouel D. Babinski K. Seguela P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A full-length hP2X5 subunit generated by incorporating a sequence corresponding to exon 10 (as identified by a TBLASTN search of human genomic DNA) was expressed well in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and provided robust ATP-dependent currents (9Bo X. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. Kim M. Burnstock G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this report we sequentially generated a full-length hP2X5 subunit cDNA by progressively and repeatedly inserting codons for 4-8 amino acids of the spliced-out exon 10 and then determined the assembly state of the resultant constructs by blue native PAGE. We also challenged homotrimerization of the full-length P2X5 subunit by block replacements of amino acids throughout the pre-TM2 and TM2 regions to test for the presence of residues important for P2X5 subunit-subunit recognition. Our results are consistent with the view that TM2 supports homotrimerization in a relatively sequence-unspecific manner by tethering the C-terminal end of the large ectodomain to the membrane; thus, by defining the overall shape of the ectodomain, TM2 spatially constrains folding events in a productive way. We detected a specific role in assembly recognition for only one TM2 residue, Asp355, which is fully conserved among P2X family members and may stabilize helix-helix interactions by satisfying hydrogen bonding groups in the membrane. P2X cDNA Constructs—To indicate the species origin, P2X subunit names are preceded by “h” or “r” for human or rat, respectively. Constructs from previous work include His-rP2X1 (2Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and His-rP2X5 (4Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which encode the rat P2X1 and P2X5 subunit with N-terminal His tags. The original rP2X5 clone was kindly provided by Dr. Florentina Soto (10Garcia-Guzman M. Soto F. Laube B. Stühmer W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the hP2X5 subunit (GenBank™ accession number AAC51931 (8Le K.T. Paquet M. Nouel D. Babinski K. Seguela P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) was isolated by PCR from a human brain cDNA library (Invitrogen) using sequence-specific primer pairs (forward, aaagaattcCATGGGGCAGGCGGGCTGCAA; reverse, aaagaattcGAGGCAATTCACGTGCTCCTGTGGGGCT; EcoRI cloning sites are underlined) subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pNKS2 (11Gloor S. Pongs O. Schmalzing G. Gene. 1995; 160: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and entirely sequenced. Codon insertions and replacement mutations were introduced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). P2X Receptor Expression in X. laevis Oocytes—Defolliculated X. laevis oocytes injected with capped cRNAs as described previously (12Schmalzing G. Gloor S. Omay H. Kröner S. Appelhans H. Schwarz W. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were kept at 19 °C in sterile frog Ringer's solution (ORi: 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Two days after cRNA injection, ATP responses were measured by two-electrode voltage-clamp recording at a holding potential of -60 mV as described previously (13Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Capping the N-terminal end of the rP2X5 subunit with a His tag for one-step affinity purification had virtually no effect on the electrophysiological phenotype of the corresponding receptor in X. laevis oocytes (results not shown). Radiolabeling and Affinity Purification of P2X5 Receptor Constructs—For metabolic radiolabeling, cRNA-injected oocytes and non-injected controls were incubated overnight with l-[35S]methionine (>40 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) at about 100 MBq/ml (0.4 MBq per oocyte) in ORi at 19 °C and then chased for 24 h. His-tagged receptors were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) chromatography from digitonin (1.0%) extracts of oocytes as detailed previously (2Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 14Rettinger J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33542-33547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted from Ni2+-NTA-agarose with non-denaturing buffer consisting of 250 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.4, and 1% digitonin (buffer 1) and then kept at 0 °C until analysis, which was carried out on the same day as purification. P2X5 receptor constructs at the plasma membrane were selectively labeled by incubating oocytes 2 days after cRNA injection with 125I-labeled sulfosuccinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, a membrane-impermeant derivative of the Bolton-Hunter reagent (15Thompson J.A. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) exactly as described previously (2Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 4Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified from digitonin extracts of the oocytes by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography as detailed above. Trypsin Resistance Assay—P2X5 receptor constructs, purified by non-denaturing Ni2+ affinity chromatography, were treated with 10-1000 μg/ml of bovine trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min on ice in buffer 1. Reactions were terminated by the addition of a 5-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Digested samples were then analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE with PhosphorImager scanning (see below). Blue Native PAGE and SDS-PAGE—Blue native PAGE (16Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 17Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) was carried out as described (2Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) using gradient gels (4-20% acrylamide). For partial dissociation of natively purified P2X receptors into lower-order complexes down to monomers, samples were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.1% SDS or 4-8 m urea as indicated. For SDS-PAGE or Tricine-SDS-PAGE (18Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar), proteins were supplemented with the appropriate SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol followed by heating to 56 °C for 15 min and electrophoresed in parallel with 14C-labeled molecular mass markers (Rainbow™, Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments samples were treated before SDS-PAGE for 2 h at 37 °C with either endoglycosidase H or peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40 to decrease inactivation of PNGase F. Both SDS-PAGE gels and blue native PAGE gels were fixed, dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and scanned using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Individual bands were quantified with the ImageQuant software. Functional Rat P2X5 Receptors Possess a Homotrimeric Architecture—All P2X5 constructs in this study were N-terminal-tagged with a hexahistidyl sequence to allow for protein purification by metal affinity chromatography after expression in X. laevis oocytes. Oocytes expressing WT rP2X5 subunits or His-rP2X5 subunits responded to ATP with a non-desensitizing inward current of similar shape and magnitude. A typical current trace in response to ATP from His-rP2X5 subunit-expressing oocytes is shown in Fig. 1A. The shape of the current trace was notably changed when rP2X5 receptors were repeatedly challenged with ATP. We observed the development of a slowly activating inward current, which was most likely mediated by secondary activation of oocyte endogenous channels since it was greatly reduced by flufenamic acid, an inhibitor of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (19White M.M. Aylwin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 720-724PubMed Google Scholar). Flufenamic acid did not affect the shape of the current component attributable to the ATP-activated rP2X5 channel (results not shown). We have previously demonstrated that the blue native PAGE technique has the capacity to correctly display the quaternary state of receptor channels and transporters. These include the known pentameric structure of Cys-loop receptors (2Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 39505-39512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which has also been visualized by x-ray crystallography (24Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Like other oocyte-expressed P2X receptors except for hP2X6 (4Aschrafi A. Sadtler S. Niculescu C. Rettinger J. Schmalzing G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the plasma membrane-bound rP2X5 receptor migrated on the blue native PAGE gel as a distinct protein band (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Treatment with urea (lanes 2 and 3) resulted in a ladder-like pattern of three bands, each separated by the approximate mass of an rP2X5 monomer. Using this ladder as a mass marker, a trimeric state can be assigned to the non-denatured rP2X5 receptor. Plasma membrane-bound rP2X5 subunits bear three N-glycans, which add ∼10 kDa of carbohydrate to the protein core (Fig. 1C). The mass calculated from the protein sequence is 52 kDa including the His tag, which is in good agreement with the experimental mass of ∼54 kDa of the fully deglycosylated protein. The different glycosylated states obtained by combined deglycosylation with endoglycosidase H and submaximally effective concentrations of peptide:N-glycosidase F indicate that all three predicted N-glycosylation sites (77NTT, 157NST, 202NFS) were occupied, one with a high mannose-type glycan and two with complex-type glycans (Fig. 1D). Human P2X5 Subunits Lacking Exon 10 Are Trimerization-defective—Using gene-specific primer pairs, we PCR-amplified an hP2X5 cDNA from a human brain cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence was identical to a previously reported hP2X5 splice variant that lacked exon 10 (8Le K.T. Paquet M. Nouel D. Babinski K. Seguela P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We refer to this splice variant as hP2X Δ328-3495 to indicate that codons 328-349 of the full-length P2X5 subunit are missing. The location of the exon 10-specified sequence relative to the membrane is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2A. Consistent with previous studies (8Le K.T. Paquet M. Nouel D. Babinski K. Seguela P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), expression of hP2X Δ328-3495 in Xenopus oocytes did not lead to the formation of an ATP-gated cation channel. Because trimerization is essential for P2X receptor function, we performed a blue native PAGE analysis to investigate the assembly status of this splice variant. Fig. 2B, lane 1, shows that the [35S]methionine-labeled His-hP2X Δ328-3495 protein was poorly expressed and migrated on the blue native PAGE gel as an amorphous mass of protein (indicative of aggregates) rather than as a distinct band. In contrast, full-length His-rP2X5 subunits migrated largely as homotrimers (Fig. 2B, lanes 10 and 11). We conclude that the lack of exon 10 results in a severe assembly defect that prevents the formation of functional homotrimeric hP2X5 receptor channels at the level of subunit assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum. Not All Exon 10-Encoded Residues Are Necessary for the Tri-merization and Plasma Membrane Localization of hP2X5 Subunits—To examine which of the 22 amino acids encoded by exon 10 were necessary for proper trimer formation and ion channel function, we progressively rebuilt exon 10 by inserting codons for 4-8 consecutive amino acids at a time, thus generating by stages a full-length hP2X5 subunit cDNA (Fig. 2B). The inserted codons correspond to those previously identified by a TBLAST search of human genomic DNA corresponding to exon 10 (9Bo X. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. Kim M. Burnstock G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Expression of the various hP2X5 constructs in X. laevis oocytes revealed that insertion of a minimum of 11 amino acids (residues 328-338; construct 3) from the total of 22 amino acids encoded by exon 10 was required to mediate significant homotrimer formation. Trimerization was associated with increased protein stability and with plasma membrane localization of properly assembled trimers (Fig. 2D) but not with the formation of a functional receptor channel (Fig. 2C). ATP-gated inward currents could be elicited only from oocytes expressing the full-length His-hP2X5 subunit (Fig. 2C, lane 8). The trimerization-defective constructs His-hP2X Δ328-3495 and His-hP2X Δ335-3495 were neither functional (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2) nor exported to the cell surface (Fig. 2D, lane 2). Accordingly, once the span of inserted residues specified by exon 10 is of adequate length to allow for trimer formation, the resultant protein complex must have a sufficiently native-like conformation to be no longer recognized and retained by the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system, which retains malfolded proteins. Insertion of Alanines, but Not Serines, Supports Trimerization as Efficiently as the Insertion of Genuine Exon 10 Residues—Insertion of seven residues, 335PTIINVG341, into the His-hP2X Δ335-3495 construct resulted in a polypeptide that efficiently assembled into homotrimers (cf. Fig. 2B, lane 4). To determine whether this effect was sequence specific, we inserted a stretch of seven alanine or serine residues instead of the genuine 335PTIINVG341 sequence and examined whether any of these substitutions was able to support oligomerization (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, the polyalanine stretch (lane 5) supported trimerization equally well as the 335PTIINVG341 sequence, whereas the polyserine stretch (lane 6) did not. Trimerization Parallels the Formation of a Second Membrane-spanning Segment—A possible explanation of these results is that alanine but not serine residues are capable of complementing the missing outer portion of TM2, thus allowing for membrane anchoring of the C-terminal end of the ectodomain. To address this possibility, we tried to exploit the fact that the hP2X5 subunit carries an N-glycosylation sequence, 430NGS (numbering refers to the full-length hP2X5 subunit), which is normally topologically inaccessible because it resides on the C-terminal endodomain (cf. topology model in Fig. 2A). This site may be expected to be N-glycosylated when TM2 is excluded from the lipid bilayer, thus forcing the C-terminal tail to remain aberrantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Deglycosylation analysis, however, provided no evidence for hyperglycosylation of the hP2X Δ328-3495 polypeptide, which could be shown to carry two N-glycans (results not shown); this is fully consistent with the occurrence of two N-glycosylation sites in the ectodomain. 430NGS may remain unused as an acceptor site because of its short distance of only 15 residues to the C-terminal end (25Nilsson I. Von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17338-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, we mutated the normally cytoplasmic Glu380 to Asn, thus generating an artificial glycosylation reporter sequence (380NDS; numbering refers to the full-length hP2X5 subunit) located at a more distal position of 65 residues from the C-terminal end. Fully efficient glycosylation has been shown to occur if 60 or greater residues separate the glycosylation acceptor site from the C terminus (25Nilsson I. Von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17338-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, the corresponding hP2X Δ328-3495 mutant migrated with a 2-3-kDa higher mass (Fig. 3A, lane 2) than the parent construct (lane 1), demonstrating glycosylation of Asn380 and, hence, a luminal orientation of most likely the entire C-terminal tail (cf. model in Fig. 3B). This result can best be reconciled with the exclusion of the incomplete TM2 sequence Gly350-Ile362 from the membrane as a result of a negative hydrophobic mismatch that occurs when the length of a hydrophobic transmembrane segment is too short to span the thickness of the hydrophobic bilayer (26Killian J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that the identical acceptor site remained unused when engineered into the trimerization-competent hP2X Δ339-3495 construct (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Evidently, pre-TM2 residues Ala328-Ile338 can combine with the TM2-authentic residues Gly350-Ile362 to form a hydrophobic domain of sufficient length to be integrated into the membrane. The concurrency of correct transmembrane threading and appearance of homotrimers on the blue native PAGE gel suggests an important role for TM2 in P2X5 subunit homotrimerization. Hydrophobicity of TM2 and of TM2-embedded Aspartate 355 Contributes to Stable hP2X5 Homotrimer Formation—To further examine the contribution of amino acid side chains specified by exon 10 and more distal sequences to trimerization in the context of the full-length hP2X5, we carried out a systematic mutagenesis. Five consecutive amino acids were replaced by single alanines throughout the sequence Lys330-Leu361 (except for one double alanine mutation,328AGKF331 to 328AGAA331) of the full-length His-hP2X5 construct, comprising all exon 10-specified residues plus the subsequent 12 residues of the inner half of TM2 (Fig. 4). Overall, alanine block mutations were well tolerated. Only one of the mutants, 330AA331-hP2X5, was more likely to aggregate than to homotrimerize (Fig. 4A, lane 3). The ATP-gated inward current amplitude was similarly reduced to ∼one-third of that mediated by the WT hP2X5 receptor (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Cell surface radioiodination verified that the 330AA331-hP2X5 mutant appeared exclusively as properly assembled trimers at the surface, albeit at lower levels than the WT hP2X5 receptor (Fig. 4C). Strikingly, none of the pentaalanine block mutations covering the entire span of TM2 affected either subunit homotrimerization (Fig. 4A) or export to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4, B and C). Robust inward currents in response to ATP were mediated by most of the mutants. Only penta-alanine substitutions in the inner third of TM2 (residues 352-361) abolished channel function, but these mutants also appeared as homotrimers at the cell surface (Fig. 4, B and C). To examine if trimer formation is also possible when bulkier residues than alanine are substituted, we performed a similar mutagenesis of TM2 with penta-leucine and penta-glutamine substitutions. Results obtained by leucine replacements of residues 337-361 resembled those obtained by equivalent alanine replacements except in one respect; the 352FFCDL mutant trimerized only weakly (Fig. 5A, lane 5). All the other leucine replacement mutants assembled into homotrimers as efficiently (lanes 2-4 and 6) as the parent hP2X5 subunit (lane 1). Even when 15 consecutive residues constituting the N-terminal two-thirds of TM2 (residues 337-351) were simultaneously replaced by leucines, homotrimers formed and appeared at the cell surface (Fig. 5B). However, inclusion of the 352FFCDL sequence to replace 20 consecutive residues by leucines virtually abolished trimer formation (results not shown). Responses to ATP could be elicited from mutants carrying leucine replacements at the membrane entry (residues 337-341) or exit sites of TM2 (residues 357-361), but penta-leucine replacements in the center of TM2 resulted in non-functional trimers (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-6, lower panels). Penta-glutamine block replacements of the same TM2 residues resulted in all cases in severe assembly defects, as judged by the inability of these mutants to migrate as defined oligomers on blue native PAGE gels (Fig. 5A, lanes 9-13). Moreover, all the penta-glutamine replacement mutants were non-functional in terms of mediating ATP-gated inward currents (lanes 9-13, lower panels). Introducing the same glycosylation reporter sequence 380NDS as described above (cf. Fig. 3B) into two of the glutamine mutants resulted in a 2-3-kDa increase in molecular mass (Fig. 5C). This mass shift indicates usage of Asn380 and, accordingly, exclusion of the penta-glutamine block-containing TM2 sequence from the membrane. To address the impaired trimerization of the 352FFCDL leucine replacement mutant in more detail, single, double, and triple mutants were generated. All of the mutants that included the D355L mutation trimerized very weakly even if singly mutated (Fig. 6A, lanes 2-4). In contrast, leucine replacement of 352FFC alone, thus excluding Asp355, did not lower the trimerization efficiency (Fig. 6A, lane 5). Quantification of radioactivity showed that about 10-fold fewer trimers were formed from the D355L-containing mutants than from the WT hP2X5 subunit or from the 352FFC leucine replacement mutant. In addition, a subset of the D355L-containing mutants migrated as dimers. This can best be seen in the quantitative scans of the various protein lanes (Fig. 6B). None of these mutants was capable of mediating ATP-gated inward current in oocytes, as assessed by two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements. The Entire TM2 Domain Is Required for Subunit T"
https://openalex.org/W2168107793,"Amplification of the 8p11-12 region occurs in 15-20% of breast cancers, but the driving oncogene at this locus has yet to be definitively identified. We mapped the 8p11-12 amplicon in breast cancer cell lines and primary human breast cancers and identified the candidate oncogene human Sm-like protein (hLsm1, LSM1) based on increases in copy number and expression level relative to human mammary epithelial cells. To examine the oncogenic role of LSM1, we overexpressed this gene in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells and inhibited its production in the SUM44 breast cancer cell line, which has a natural amplification and overexpression of LSM1. Our data confirmed that LSM1 is an oncogene from the 8p11-12 amplicon by showing that hLsm1 overexpression induced growth factor-independent proliferation and soft agar colony formation in MCF10A cells, and hLsm1 inhibition in SUM44 cells dramatically reduced soft agar growth. Little is known about hLsm1 function other than its involvement in mRNA degradation; therefore, we used expression microarray analysis to investigate how hLsm1 affects cell transformation in MCF10A and SUM44 cells. We identified numerous genes altered following hLsm1 overexpression common to SUM44 breast cancer cells that play important roles in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation and other cancer-promoting processes. Future work will continue to characterize these important changes to achieve a more complete understanding of the mechanism of hLsm1's effect on cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2019180408,"We report here that ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 regulates amino acid transporter ATA2 activity on the cell surface. We first found that a proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased the uptake of alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric acid, a model substrate for amino acid transport system A, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as the preadipocytes. Transient expression of Nedd4-2 in Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells down-regulated the ATA2 transport activity induced by injected cRNA and transfected cDNA, respectively. Neither the Nedd4-2 mutant with defective catalytic domain nor c-Cbl affected the ATA2 activity significantly. RNA-mediated interference of Nedd4-2 increased the ATA2 activity in the cells, and this was associated with decreased polyubiquitination of ATA2 on the cell surface membrane. Immunofluorescent analysis of Nedd4-2 in the adipocytes stably transfected with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged ATA2 showed the co-localization of Nedd4-2 and EGFP-ATA2 in the plasma membrane but not in the perinuclear ATA2 storage site, supporting the idea that the primary site for the ubiquitination of ATA2 is the plasma membrane. These data suggest that ATA2 on the plasma membrane is subject to polyubiquitination by Nedd4-2 with consequent endocytotic sequestration and proteasomal degradation and that this process is an important determinant of the density of ATA2 functioning on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1984032158,"Isothermal titration calorimetry has been applied to characterize the thermodynamics of ligand binding to wild-type lactose permease (LacY) and a mutant (C154G) that strongly favors an inward facing conformation. The affinity of wild-type or mutant LacY for ligand and the change in free energy (ΔG) upon binding are similar. However, with the wild type, the change in free energy upon binding is due primarily to an increase in the entropic free energy component (TΔS), whereas in marked contrast, an increase in enthalpy (ΔH) is responsible for ΔG in the mutant. Thus, wild-type LacY behaves as if there are multiple ligand-bound conformational states, whereas the mutant is severely restricted. The findings also indicate that the structure of the mutant represents a conformational intermediate in the overall transport cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2162131537,"The recently suggested antiparallel topology of EmrE has intriguing implications for many aspects of the biology of ioncoupled transporters. However, it is at odds with biochemical data that demonstrated the same topology for all protomers in the intact cell and with extensive cross-linking studies. To examine this apparent contradiction we chemically cross-linked dimers with a rigid bifunctional maleimide using Cys replacements at positions not permissible by an antiparallel topology. A purified cross-linked dimer binds substrate and transports it in proteoliposomes with kinetic constants similar to those of the non-cross-linked dimer. The cross-linked dimers do not interact with non-cross-linked dimers as judged from the fact that inactive mutants do not affect their activity (negative dominance). The results support the contention that EmrE with parallel topology is fully functional. We show that the detergents used in crystallization increase the fraction of monomers in solution. We suggest that the antiparallel orientation observed is a result of the arrangement of the monomers in the crystal.

Recent publications describing high resolution structures of transporters are changing a field that has been waiting avidly for such advancements (1Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G.

This welcome revolution provides fundamental insights for designing new biochemical/biophysical approaches and will deepen understanding of transport mechanisms.However, in some cases, as for the channel-forming peptide Gramicidin, for the ABC transporter MsbA, and for EmrE, an Escherichia coli ion-coupled multidrug transporter, different structures have been reported for the same protein, and it is not evident that these purportedly different conformations are physiologically relevant (5Andersen O.S.

The question is raised whether these are proteins with multiple conformations that fulfill functions yet unknown to us or whether the reported conformations are an experimental artifact created by the different milieu the proteins face when removed from their native environments. This may turn out to be especially critical for membrane proteins where we can only feebly mimic the original conditions after solubilization with detergents. A leading criterion at this stage should be whether the protein has some measurable function in the detergent-solubilized state.Two x-ray structures of EmrE have been published, and they are very different from each other (7Pornillos O. Chen Y.J. Chen A.P. Chang G. Science. 2005; 310: 1950-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Ma C. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2852-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The presence of substrate in the second one may be responsible for the large differences between the two structures, although similar substrate-induced conformational changes were not observed in two-dimensional crystals (9Tate C.G. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Baldwin J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Baldwin J.M. Schuldiner S. Tate C.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6175-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure shows an asymmetric dimer with the protomers in an antiparallel topological orientation. This finding has obvious and exciting similarities to the internal structural repeat found in several membrane proteins such as aquaporins, ClC channel, and the neurotransmitter transporter homologue LeuT (11Murata K.

However, it is at odds with biochemical data that demonstrated the same topology for all protomers in the intact cell and in membrane vesicles (14Ninio S. Elbaz Y. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and with extensive cross-linking studies (15Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Because an apparent antiparallel topology of a homodimer has many intriguing implications regarding biogenesis, insertion, and evolution of ion-coupled transporters, the topic has already attracted much attention (16Pornillos O. Chang G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Bowie J.U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Rapp M. Granseth E.

To investigate the apparent contradiction between our previous work and the proposed antiparallel topology we reevaluated our cross-linking studies. We chemically cross-linked dimers using Cys replacements in transmembrane 4 (TM4) 2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment; EmrE, EmrE tagged with Myc epitope and six His residues; CAMY, a cysteine-less EmrE that was built with alanine replacements; MV2+, methyl viologen; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-maltoside; OG, octyl-β-glucoside; NG, nonyl-β-glucoside; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-glycine. 2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment; EmrE, EmrE tagged with Myc epitope and six His residues; CAMY, a cysteine-less EmrE that was built with alanine replacements; MV2+, methyl viologen; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-maltoside; OG, octyl-β-glucoside; NG, nonyl-β-glucoside; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-glycine. at positions not permissible by an antiparallel topology. To test whether the cross-linked proteins reflect a physiologically relevant conformation, we purified one of them and showed it is fully functional. The cross-linked dimers bind substrate and transport it in proteoliposomes with kinetic constants similar to those of the noncross-linked dimer. The cross-linked dimers do not interact with non-cross-linked dimers as judged from the fact that inactive mutants do not affect their activity (negative dominance). In addition, the cross-linked dimers are remarkably more stable to heat treatment. The results support the contention that EmrE with a parallel topology is fully functional. We cannot rule out the existence of an antiparallel arrangement outside of the crystal world, but if it exists its functionality remains to be characterized. Our work with the detergents used for crystallization of EmrE shows that they weaken the interaction of the monomers in the dimer. We suggest that the monomers generated are the ones that crystallize and the antiparallel arrangement in the crystal is, most likely, a crystallographic dimer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and MutagenesisE. coli DH5α (Invitrogen) and TA15 (19Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) strains were used throughout this work. TA15 strain was previously transformed with plasmid pGP1-2, which codes for the T7 polymerase under the inducible control of the λ PL promoter (20Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). The plasmids used for EmrE gene expression are pT7-7 (20Tabor S. Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar) derivatives with a His6 tag (EmrE-His, for simplicity will be called EmrE throughout this report) (21Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The construction of the mutants was as previously described (22Steiner Mordoch S. Granot D. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19480-19486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The template used for mutagenesis was pT7-7 CAMY (a cysteine-less EmrE with alanine replacements) (23Gutman N. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16082-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All of the PCR-amplified products were sequenced to ensure that no other mutations occurred during the amplification process.Overexpression and Purification of EmrETA15 cells that bear plasmids pGP1-2 and pT7-7 containing His-tagged EmrE constructs were grown and induced for EmrE expression as previously described. For specific labeling with [35S]methionine the procedure was as described (24Rotem D. Sal-man N. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48243-48249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For purification, cells were resuspended in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15 μg/ml DNaseI, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 ml of buffer/g of wet weight cells). Cells were disrupted using a Microfluidics microfluidizer processor (M-110EHi) (25Elbaz Y. Tayer N. Steinfels E. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7369-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For protein solubilization, 1% of DDM and 50 mm imidazole were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 240,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The solubilized protein was loaded on HiTrap™ chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) mounted on Akta Explorer (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with 0.08% DDM, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, and 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, till A280 of the flow-through decreased below 0.05. EmrE was eluted with a gradient of up to 300 mm imidazole. Major peak fractions were pooled, and the protein solution was brought to ∼1 mg/ml EmrE (according to A280). The protein stock was aliquoted, frozen in liquid air, and stored at -70 °C. In the case of the D84C mutant, after solubilization the β-mercaptoethanol was removed by desalting on a G50-Sephadex column equilibrated with 1% DDM, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, and 50 mm imidazole. The cross-linking reagent o-PDM was immediately added (0.5 mm) and incubated for 1 h at 65 °C following 5 min at 75 °C.o-PDM Cross-linking and Purification of the Cross-linked ProteinProtein stock stored at -70 °C was rapidly thawed at 30 °C, and 1% DDM and 0.5 mm o-PDM were added to the protein solution. After 1 h at 45°C followed by 10 min at 60 °C, the mixture was diluted 15-fold with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.6, and 0.02% DDM and loaded on a HiTrap Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column mounted on Akta Explorer (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 5 column volumes of the above buffer, and the cross-linked protein was eluted by stepwise elevation of the NaCl concentration to 220 mm. The peak fractions were pooled, and the protein solution was brought to ∼1 mg/ml EmrE (according to A280). The protein stock was aliquoted, frozen in liquid air, and stored at -70 °C.Reconstitution of EmrEReconstitution was performed essentially as described (26Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were diluted with 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 (sodium buffer), and 0.08% DDM to lower imidazole concentration below 20 mm (if needed) and allowed to bind to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with at least 4 ml of sodium buffer containing 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Glycon GmbH), 30 mm imidazole, and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted with 500 μl of the same buffer containing 200 mm imidazole and mixed with 375 μl of E. coli phospholipid mix (10 mg of E. coli lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), 1.2% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl). Eluted protein and phospholipids were sonicated together in a bath-type sonicator to clarity and diluted in buffer containing 0.15 m (NH4)2SO4, 15mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After 20 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 60 min and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer, frozen in liquid air, and stored at -70 °C. Prior to the transport assay, the proteoliposomes were thawed at room temperature and sonicated lightly to clarity.To determine the protein concentration in the proteoliposomes, they were solubilized in buffer containing 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 6 m urea, and 2% SDS (SDS-urea buffer) for 15 min. The solubilized proteins were immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads for 1 h at room temperature. The unbound material was discarded, and the His-tagged protein bound to beads was washed twice with SDS-urea buffer. The protein was eluted from the beads using a buffer containing 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 450 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The intensity of the staining was quantitated using Image Gauge 3.46 Fujifilm software. The results were calibrated to protein amount after staining of the same gels with Coomassie staining, scanning, and quantitation using the same software. Each experiment was performed at least three times.[3H]TPP+ Binding and [14C] Methyl Viologen Uptake AssaysTetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) binding was assayed essentially as described (21Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Uptake of [14C]methyl viologen (MV2+) into proteoliposomes was assayed at 25 °C by dilution of 2 μl of (NH4)2SO4 containing proteoliposomes into 200 μl of an ammonium-free solution (26Yerushalmi H. Mordoch S.S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12744-12748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Yerushalmi H. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6856-6863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The latter contained 20 μm [14C]MV2+ (11.9 mCi/mmol; Sigma), 140 mm K2SO4, 10 mm Tricine, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5. Each experiment was performed at least twice.Monomer-swapping ExperimentsHeat Treatment—Protein at a concentration of ∼0.5 μg/ml was mixed with increasing amounts of purified EmrE E14C protein in 300 μl of 0.08% DDM-sodium buffer. After 10 min at 80 °C the samples were allowed to cool down and subjected to pulse centrifugation.Octyl Glucoside Treatment—EmrE mutants E14C and CAMY were solubilized in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, and either OG 2% or DDM 1% (membrane concentration was adjusted to the equivalent of 30 and 3.8 ng of EmrE/μl) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C on a shaker. After centrifugation for 10 min at 14K rpm, increasing amounts of E14C mutants were added to 50 ng of CAMY protein. DDM (1%) was added to the OG-treated samples, and they were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C.Heat DenaturationPurified protein was diluted to ∼0.1 μg/ml in 900 μl of 0.08% DDM-sodium buffer and incubated at 80 °C for the indicated time periods. After incubation, protein solutions were allowed to cool down and subjected to pulse centrifugation.RESULTSSingle Cysteine Replacements Chosen to Probe Relative Arrangement of the EmrE TM4 Segments within the Dimer—EmrE contains four transmembrane helices (TM), connected by relatively short loops. The relative arrangement of the TM4 segments varies drastically in the published x-ray structures. To reevaluate our data obtained with the use of various cross-linking reagents we focused on two single cysteine replacements at the N and C termini of the TM4, D84C and T108C. Existing EmrE x-ray structures do not permit homo-cross-linking at these positions (Fig. 1). Both D84C and T108C mutations are tolerated by EmrE without any loss of function, reside outside the hydrophobic protein core, and react readily with maleimide reagents.Preparation of Cross-linked EmrE Homodimers—Both T108C and D84C single cysteine replacements of EmrE have shown high (∼ 60-70%) extent of intermonomer cross-linking when treated with o-PDM, a bifunctional rigid maleimide reagent (Fig. 2A). Such high yields suggest that cross-linked pairs correspond to highly populated conformations of EmrE. To eliminate the possibility that these cross-linked species derive from misfolded or inactive protein, we purified one of them (T108C) in quantities sufficient for functional characterization. Scaling up of the protein concentration decreased the cross-linking yield; therefore, optimization of the reaction conditions and purification of the cross-linked species were required. The T108C cross-linked species was enriched up to ∼90% purity by anion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q-Sepharose column as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2,B and C). o-PDM-treated D84C with ∼40% cross-linked content was used throughout this work because we were not able to purify it further. The T108C cross-linked and the untreated proteins behave identically in size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2D), showing that large complexes are not generated by multiple cross-linking between dimers.FIGURE 2Purification of EmrE cross-linked at position T108C with o-PDM. A, EmrE T108C (left lane) radiolabeled with [35S]methionine (15Soskine M. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12043-12048Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was solubilized and cross-linked with o-PDM (right lane) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE, visualized with a Fujifilm LAS-1000 imaging system, and digitally analyzed with Image Gauge 3.46 Fujifilm software. B, elution profile of o-PDM-treated EmrE T108C on a 5-ml Q FF-Sepharose column. For details see “Experimental Procedures.” C, the protein content of the eluted fractions was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie stain. In the pooled peak I, eluted from the column at ∼220 mm NaCl, ∼90% of the protein was cross-linked. In various preparations, homogeneity ranged between 80-95%. D, o-PDM-treated EmrE T108C co-elutes with untreated mutant. The column used was a 20 ml Superdex 200 HR column. Bottom, optical density trace; top, the protein content of the eluted fractions was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie stain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TPP+ Binding Activity of the Cross-linked Homodimers—The cross-linked and purified T108C displays high binding affinity of TPP+ almost identical to that of the untreated protein. KD and Bmax of the T108C and T108C cross-linked protein were measured using radiolabeled TPP+. The KDs were quite similar (3.7 and 6.4 nm, respectively), and the Bmax was even slightly better for the cross-linked protein (0.25 and 0.42 mol TPP+/mol EmrE, respectively), most likely because of the higher purity of the latter achieved by the ion exchange chromatography. TPP+ binding activity of the D84C mutant slightly increases after cross-linking with o-PDM (data not shown). However, because of the relatively lower content of the cross-linked species (∼40%) we cannot reach definitive conclusions about its activity with this assay.MV2+ Uptake Activity of the Cross-linked EmrE T108C—To further test the full functionality of the cross-linked T108C we reconstituted it into proteoliposomes and assayed its ability to catalyze proton gradient-driven uptake of MV2+. Upon generation of a pH gradient, the rates of uptake and the level of accumulation of MV2+ detected in proteoliposomes reconstituted with either untreated or cross-linked T108C were very similar (Fig. 3). These findings allow us to conclude that EmrE cross-linked at position 108 is a fully functional transporter. This result also suggests that no extensive relative movements of the EmrE C terminus take place during MV2+ transport, because the covalent link introduced between cysteines at 108 position has no negative impact on the uptake rate.FIGURE 3Proton-driven methyl viologen transport activity of cross-linked T108C. Ammonium-loaded proteoliposomes reconstituted with cross-linked purified T108C (filled circles) or with control untreated T108C (open circles) were diluted into an ammonium-free medium containing 20 μm [14C]methyl viologen, pH 8.5, and radioactivity incorporated at various times was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Probing Interdimeric Interaction by “Monomer Swapping” with E14C-inactive EmrE Mutant—EmrE dimers solubilized with DDM may be reversibly dissociated by a short heat treatment. If a mixture of two mutant proteins is subjected to this procedure, mixed dimers are formed upon cooling (monomer swapping) (24Rotem D. Sal-man N. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48243-48249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As was shown previously, EmrE E14C does not bind TPP+ but may take part in the formation of mixed dimers with other EmrE mutants. These mixed dimers display ∼20-fold lower affinity toward TPP+, a phenomenon defined as a negative dominant effect of the inactive mutant on the functional one (24Rotem D. Sal-man N. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48243-48249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Elbaz Y. Steiner-Mordoch S. Danieli T. Schuldiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We used this experimental paradigm to test whether the activity of the homocross-linked dimers T108C and D84C is derived from interdimeric interaction. Increasing amounts of EmrE E14C were added to cross-linked and untreated D84C and T108C proteins; the mixtures were subjected to the monomer-swapping procedure and assayed for TPP+ binding activity. At the TPP+ concentration used in the assay (2.5 nm) the contribution of mixed oligomers containing E14C is insignificant due to their lower affinity, and therefore inhibition of binding reflects the formation of mixed dimers (24Rotem D. Sal-man N. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48243-48249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After monomer swapping with a 10-fold excess of the E14C mutant, the binding activity of the protein that was not treated with cross-linker was inhibited >80% (Fig. 4A, open circles). Under the same conditions, binding activity of cross-linked T108C is only barely affected (∼15%; Fig. 4A, closed circles). In a parallel experiment with the cross-linked D84C, activity decreased by ∼40% (Fig. 4B). The degree of inhibition of activity of both cross-linked mutants is in line with the percent of the cross-linked species in the assayed reaction (∼90 and 40%, respectively, for T108C and D84C). The results support the conclusion that in both mutants cross-linking prevents monomer swapping and the activity remaining after addition of an excess of the inactive EmrE E14C reflects the percent of cross-linked fully functional dimer.FIGURE 4Negative dominance does not occur when the functional dimer is cross-linked. Increasing amounts of the inactive EmrE mutant E14C were added to 60 ng of the untreated (open circles) and cross-linked (filled circles) T108C (A) or to 100 ng of the corresponding D84C (B) proteins. After incubation at 80 °C (10 min), the mixture was transferred to 4 °C and assayed for [3H]TPP+ binding as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Comparing Heat Stability of the Untreated and Cross-linked EmrE T108C—EmrE displays rather remarkable heat stability in the solubilized state (24Rotem D. Sal-man N. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48243-48249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TPP+ binding activity is irreversibly lost after incubation periods at high temperatures (80 °C) longer than 30 min (Fig. 5). Assuming that the first stage of the process that leads to the denatured protein is dimer dissociation, we compared the stability of the untreated and cross-linked T108C against the heat denaturation. Cross-linked and untreated 108C were diluted to ∼0.1 μg/ml to encourage dimer dissociation and incubated for increasing time periods at 80 °C. As seen in Fig. 5 the cross-linked dimer (closed circles) lost practically no activity (∼90%) even after 6 h of incubation at 80 °C, whereas the untreated protein was already inhibited by 50% after 1 h. Overnight incubations at 80 °C inhibited practically all the activity of both proteins (not shown). The dramatic stability of the cross-linked protein to heat supports the contention that the first step in the denaturation involves dimer dissociation. The results also suggest that the functional unit is within the parallel cross-linked dimer.FIGURE 5Time course of the thermal denaturation of cross-linked T108C. Purified proteins were diluted to ∼0.1 μg/ml and subjected to incubation at 80 °C. At the indicated times, they were cooled to 4 °C and ligand binding was measured with 2.5 nm [3H]TPP+ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cross-linked T108C (filled circles); untreated T108C (open circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Detergents That Inhibit Binding Activity Also Inhibit o-PDM-mediated Cross-linking—Because our results demonstrate the functionality of an EmrE dimer with the protomers arranged in a parallel configuration, we searched for possible factors that could explain the generation of antiparallel dimers in the crystal structures published. We explored whether some of the conditions used to prepare the protein for crystallization could somehow affect activity and/or the oligomeric state. Because one of the most important factors determining the oligomeric state of a membrane protein is the nature of the detergent used for solubilization, we tested the effect of detergents used for crystallization on TPP+ binding activity, a function that requires an intact dimer. When EmrE was extracted with NG or OG the binding capacity of the protein was significantly diminished (16.7 and 9.6 pmol/μg EmrE, respectively, and Fig. 6A) as compared with the maximum measured with protein extracted with DDM (31.4 pmol/μg EmrE). The results suggest that in the presence of NG or OG only a fraction (53 and 30%, respectively) of the protein binds TPP+. In addition, the remaining functional fraction bound with an affinity 10-fold lower than that detected in the DDM protein, 32 and 41 nm for NG and OG, respectively, as compared with 3.2 nm in DDM.FIGURE 6Octyl and nonyl glucosides influence dimer-monomer equilibrium.

These complexes represent interesting points of chemical intervention for the development of antineoplastic molecules. Here we describe the identification of an all d-amino acid hexapeptide, termed NBI1, that inhibits the kinase activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2)-cyclin A complex through selective binding to cyclin A. The mechanism of inhibition is non-competitive for ATP and non-competitive for protein substrates. In contrast to the existing CDKs peptide inhibitors, the hexapeptide NBI1 interferes with the formation of the cdk2-cyclin A complex. Furthermore, a cell-permeable derivative of NBI1 induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of tumor cell lines. Thus, the NBI1-binding site on cyclin A may represent a new target site for the selective inhibition of activity cdk2-cyclin A complex.

The interactions between proteins represent points of chemical intervention for therapeutic gain in the biological processes associated with disease. Because of the specificity of individual protein-protein interactions the modulation of these complexes is viewed as a putative source of future new highly selective drugs (1Berg T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 2462-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 2Cochran A.G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Cochran A.G. Chem.

The early experience in the design of peptides and small non-peptidic compounds that bind to protein interfaces (2Cochran A.G. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar) encouraged the viability of protein-protein interactions as target for drug discovery. In particular, there has been much progress in the discovery of small molecule inhibitors of the unregulated cell growth that characterize cancer cells (5Arkin M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2005; 9: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Proliferation of eukaryotic cells is under control of a series of concerted molecular mechanisms defined as the cell division cycle whose progression is tightly governed by members of the cyclin-dependent kinase family (CDKs) 3The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CKI, CDK inhibitor proteins; CRM, cyclin recruitment motif; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Ac, acetyl; MCM2, minichromosome maintenance 2. 3The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CKI, CDK inhibitor proteins; CRM, cyclin recruitment motif; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Ac, acetyl; MCM2, minichromosome maintenance 2.

Thus, CDKs mediated phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein pRb is required for inactivation of the protein and for the subsequent release of E2F transcription factors, thus altering the status of E2F-regulated genes from fully repressed to induced and leading progression through G1 to S phases (8Dynlacht B.D. Flores O. Lees J.A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1772-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 9Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). The pRb-E2F pathway is frequently deregulated in cancer cells. E2F transcription factors are the preferential pRb targets, however, their binding to DNA is also regulated by cdk2-cyclin A activity. E2F phosphorylation by cdk2-cyclin A inhibits its binding to DNA leading to the end of the transcription of E2F-regulated genes produced at the beginning of mitosis (10Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8420-8431Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that E2F overexpression increases cell proliferation but paradoxically, it simultaneously also triggers apoptosis (12Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Adams P.D. Proc.

All this information suggests that pharmacologic inhibition of cdk2-cyclin A might be of potential interest as an antineoplastic strategy because cancer cells show an increased activity of the E2F due to pRb inactivation. Furthermore, cdk2-cyclin A complex is also required for S phase progression regulating the pre-replicative complex formation and activation (15Fotedar A. Cannella D. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T.

Moreover cyclin A is revealed as an essential gene because its deletion results in embryonic lethality shortly after implantation (17Murphy M. Stinnakre M.G. Senamaud-Beaufort C. Winston N.J.

The protein-protein complexes formed between different cyclins and cdks (we will refer to the complexes here as CDKs) are central to cell cycle regulation. These complexes and their natural inhibitors defined as CDK inhibitor proteins (CKIs) have been the object of extensive research. Considerable effort has been focused on the development of ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitors of CDKs (19Huwe A. Mazitschek R. Giannis A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 2122-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, in general, these compounds have several alternative protein targets that compromise their demanded selectivity. Then, new strategies for the inhibition of CDKs activity through blocking of substrate recruitment (20McInnes C. Fischer P.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 1845-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Fischer P.M. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov.

The cyclin recruitment motif (CRM) is a binding domain for a large number of cdk2-cyclin A substrates, as for instance, the transcription factor E2F1 (10Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29702-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All these substrates contain a highly homologous region of 12 amino acids, which includes the sequence RXLYY′, where X, Y, and Y′ are any and hydrophobic amino acids, respectively, responsible for the binding to the CRM. We are currently engaged in a discovery program that targets the complex cdk2-cyclin A with the aim of finding new lead compounds that could be developed in safety and selective antineoplasic drugs. Here we describe the identification of an hexapeptide that inhibits the kinase activity of the cdk2-cyclin A complex through selective binding to cyclin A. The characterization of the inhibitory mechanism revealed that the hexapeptide is non-competitive for either ATP or histone H1. A cell permeable derivative of the hexapeptide induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of tumor cell lines. Preparation of Synthetic Combinatorial Libraries and Individual Peptides—The dual defined position library, Ac-OOXXXX-NH2 was synthesized in an iterative format using the process of divide, couple, and recombine in conjunction with simultaneous peptide synthesis. All individual peptides were prepared using simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis. Peptide mixtures and individual peptides were solubilized in H2O or 5% Me2SO/H2O aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. Individual peptides were characterized by laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analyses and purified by preparative reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. Protein Expression and Purification—Cdk2, cyclin A full-length, and cyclin A fragment (A1 amino acids 1-88; A2 amino acids 1-171; A3 amino acids 1-257; A4 amino acids 1-345; A5 amino acids 171-432; and A6 amino acids 257-432) cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-6P plasmid; and a fragment of pRb, fpRb (amino acids 792-928), and p21Cip1 were cloned into pGEX-KG-2T plasmid. All were glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm) to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.8). Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm and the culture was incubated for a further 4 h at room temperature. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in NENT buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Igepal®, Sigma)) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication. The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was incubated on a glutathione-Sepharose column according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). In some cases GST was separated from the GST fusion proteins by digestion with thrombin protease (Sigma) or PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Kinase Assays for the Screening—Kinase assays were carried out in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates that were blocked with 200 μl of blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Tween, and 0.02% sodium azide) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed 3 times with 100 μl of washing solution (PBS containing 0.02% Tween and 0.02% sodium azide). Plates were then dried during 2-4 h at room temperature, and stored at 4 °C. Under these conditions, they are stable for 1 month. Assays were performed in a final volume of 60 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 4 μg of histone H1 (Roche Applied Science), 30 μm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml), 800 nm GST-cdk2, and 800 nm GST-cyclin A. Assays were carried out in the presence or absence of different concentrations of peptide mixtures to be checked. An inhibitory control was performed adding 800 nm GST-p21 to the reaction media. Mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, 50 μl of each mixture were filtered in nitrocellulose membranes placed in a dot blot apparatus. Samples were washed with 35 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and finally with two washes of 100 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by 100 μl of H2O. After this process, membranes were dried at room temperature. The radioactivity associated to the membranes was detected with a Molecular Imager FX; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Determination of cdk1, cdk2, and cdk6 IC50—Assays were performed in duplicate in a 30-μl final volume containing 2 μg of histone H1 or histone H1-derived peptide, pepH1 (PKTPKKAKKL) as a substrate and the CDK complex (25 ng of cdk2-cyclin A, 25 ng of cdk2-cyclin E, 20 ng of cdk1-cyclin B1, or 25 ng of cdk6-cyclin D3), all purchased to Upstate Biotechnology, in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μm ATP, and 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Reactions were incubated 30 min at 37 °C and then were stopped by transferring 25 μl of each on Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. The filters were washed three times with 1% phosphoric acid, air dried, and finally counted in liquid scintillation equipment (Wallac). In the substrate competitive assays the sequence of peptide inhibitor (referred to as pepH1-T3V) is PKVPKKAKKL. In some assays, the GST-pRb protein fragment, fpRb (amino acids 792-928), was used as a substrate. In these cases, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of Laemmli buffer. Samples were solved in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then the gel was dried. The radioactivity associated to the gel was detected with a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). In the assays describing a non-competitive action to the CRM of cyclin A, the pepp21 (FYHSKRRLIFS), derived from p21Cip1 that targets the CRM, was used. Immunoprecipitation and CDK Activity Assays—HCT116 cells were lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/μl aprotinin, 10 μg/μl leupeptin) for 40 min on ice. Lysates (0.25-0.5 mg of protein) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-cdk1 (Santa Cruz sc-54), anti-cdk2 (Santa Cruz sc-163), or anti-cdk4 (Santa Cruz sc-749) overnight at 4 °C. Then, 40 μg of protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce) were added and samples were incubated for 1 h at 4°C. After three washes in IP buffer and two in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2) immunoprecipitates were resuspended in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 15 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 μg of histone H1 (for cdk2 and cdk1) or 3 μg of pRb (for cdk4 assays) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer. The samples were then electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then stained with Coomassie Blue and dried. The radioactivity associated to the gels was detected with a PhosphorImager. Determination of CK2 Activity—Protein kinase CK2 activity was assayed as described previously (27Riera M. Roher N. Miro F. Gil C. Trujillo R. Aguilera J. Plana M. Itarte E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 97-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 4 mg/ml β-casein, and β-casein peptide only phosphorylated by CK2 as substrates. One unit of protein kinase activity is defined as the amount that catalyzes the transfer of 1 nmol of phosphate from [γ-32P]GTP to β-casein per min at 30 °C. Determination of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase II Activity—The activity was measured by the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into myelin basic protein, catalyzed by the active mitogen-activated protein kinase 2/Erk2 (recombinant protein expressed in E. coli, catalog number 14-550 Upstate Biotechnology) following the manufacturer's protocol. Determination of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β Activity—The glycogen synthase kinase 3β, active (recombinant protein expressed in Sf21 cells) catalog number 14-492, Upstate Biotechnology) and the Phospho-Glycogen Synthase Peptide-2 (glycogen synthase kinase 3 substrate), catalog number 12-241 Upstate Biotechnology as a substrate, were used following the manufacturer's protocol. Fluorescence Polarization Assays—Fluorescence polarization measurements were made in black 96-well plates using a WallacVictor2 1420 Multilabel HTS counter with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and observed emission wavelength of 535 nm. The assay was carried out by adding 60 nm of the carboxyfluorescein NBI1-labeled peptide (CF-NBI1) to different concentrations of cyclin A-(171-432) in PBS buffer and incubating the samples during 20 min at 30 °C before reading. Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—All the surface plasmon resonance analysis were performed at room temperature using a Biacore 3000 (Biacore International AB). The TAT (YGRKKRRQRRRG) or TAT-NBI1 peptides were immobilized on a carboxymethylated dextran sensor chip (CM5) using the amine coupling method as described by the manufacturer. Tat peptide was used to construct the reference surface. Purified cdk2, full-length cyclin A, cyclin A fragments, and the NBI1 peptide were diluted to various concentrations with HBS-EP buffer (Biacore International AB) and each sample was injected separately over the flow cells at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for 180 s. Following a variable dissociation time, final regeneration of the surfaces was performed with a short pulse of 0.2% (w/v) SDS. The interaction between proteins and TAT-NBI1 was detected and presented as a sensorgram by plotting resonance units against time. The kinetic results were calculated using BIA Evaluation software, version 3.0.2, and binding curves were fitted to a simple 1:1 Langmuir reaction model. Cell Lines—HCT116 and HT29 are colon carcinoma cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. T98-G and A2780, a glioblastoma and an ovarian carcinoma human cell line, respectively, were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All media contained 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% nonessentials amino acids, 1 mm pyruvic acid, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Viability Assays—Cells were seeded in 96-well dishes at 7 × 103 cells/well. After 24 h Tat or Tat-NBI1 were added at different concentrations and incubated for 24 h. Following incubation, plates were rinsed with PBS and 100 μl of stock 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (0.5 mg/ml in culture medium) was added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h; then 200 μl of Me2SO were added to each well. Plates were read on a MRX (Dynatech Laboratories) reader after a 1-h incubation, at a wavelength of 570 nm. Results shown are from triplicates in at least three independent experiments. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cells were plated in 60-mm2 culture dishes at 5 × 105 cells/plate 24 h prior treatments. Tat or Tat-NBI1 were added for 24 or 48 h. Cells were fixed with 70% methanol for 2 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and finally incubated with 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide (Sigma) and 200 μg/ml RNase for 10 min at room temperature. Analysis of DNA content was carried out in a BD Biosciences FACS Calibur. Results shown are from triplicates in at least three independent experiments. Determination of DNA Synthesis, Thymidine Incorporation—Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/plate and allowed to grow for at least 24 h. Tat or Tat-NBI1 was then added for 24 h and [methyl-3H]thymidine (4 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) was incorporated 1 h before the cells were collected. DNA synthesis was determined measuring the incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into DNA as described (28Cripps-Wolfman J. Henshaw E.C. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19478-19486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Synchronization and Laser-scanning Confocal Analysis—Cells were grown on coverslips for 24 h. G1 synchronization was achieved by maintaining at 80% of confluence the cultures with 0.5% fetal calf serum medium for 24 h. Cells were synchronized at S phase with 1.5 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h. For synchronization in M phase, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazol during 18 h. After synchronization drugs were removed and cells were washed with fresh media and rinsed over 1 h. Treatments with TAT or TAT-NBI1 at 20 μm were then added and time courses were performed. The DNA cellular content in synchronized cultures was analyzed by laser-scanning cytometry. Cells were fixed with 70% methanol for 2 h at room temperature and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Then, they were incubated with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 200 μg/ml RNase for 10 min. The coverslips were seeded onto a slide using mounting medium containing 25% propidium iodide (100 μg/ml in PBS) and 75% glycerol. Slides were scanned using the ×40 objective and 5 milliwatts of Argon laser power. A red fluorescent threshold and a minimum cell size of 100 pixels identified cells for measurement. At least 10,000 cells were analyzed. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Treated cells were washed twice in PBS, scraped, and lysed in lysis buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (v/v) SDS). Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method. Lysates (25 μg) were loaded into a SDS-PAGE gel and after that, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes. Subsequently, membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS buffer for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with different primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: anti-phospho(S32)-MCM2 1:20000 (Abcam ab11897), anti-MCM2 1:50 (Abcam ab6153), anti-PARP 1:1000 (BD Pharmingen 556493), and anti-actin clone C4 1:1000 (ICN Biomedicals). After three washes with TBST, membranes were incubated for 45 min with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies diluted in TBS with 2.5% nonfat dry milk. The filter was then washed two times with TBST and once with TBS, and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Apoptosis Assays—For detection of cellular fragmentation into apoptotic bodies, cells were seeded on coverslips, treated at different times, fixed with 70% methanol, and subjected to DNA staining with propidium iodide. The crystallographic structure of the complex cdk2-cyclin A shows that cyclin A binds to and interacts with both the N- and C-lobes of cdk2 to form a continuous protein-protein interface (29Russo A.A.

Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). The structure of cdk2-cyclin A complexed with the CKI protein p27Kip1 has also been resolved showing the interaction between the CKI substrate and the complex at the CRM (31Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D.

A number of groups have reported the identification of inhibitors of cdk2-cyclin A through the design of molecules that bind to the CRM (20McInnes C. Fischer P.M. Curr. Pharm.

As stated above the goal of this study was to identify inhibitors of cdk2-cyclin A complexes but not targeting the ATP binding site nor the CRM. To this aim we screened combinatorial libraries in the appropriate experimental conditions, thus we adjusted the ATP concentration to be high enough to difficult ATP competition while minimizing the use of [γ-32P]ATP. As substrate we used histone H1 that is phosphorylated directly and without the required binding to the cyclin A CRM that have other substrates as pRb and E2F protein families (32Andrews M.J. McInnes C. Kontopidis G. Innes L. Cowan A. Plater A. Fischer P.M. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004; 2: 2735-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Screening of a Dual Defined Position Peptide Combinatorial Library—We initially screened a diversity oriented positional scanning library of trimers of N-alkylglycines that have previously allowed the identification of lead compounds in different biological assays in our laboratories (34Garcia-Martinez C.

However, we did not find any suitable lead compound that satisfied the initial goals. Thus we decided to focus on a putatively more reliable library that encompasses a more step-by-step definition of the functionalities required by the experimental conditions. Thus, we synthesized a dual defined position peptide combinatorial library as initially proposed by Houghten et al. (38Houghten R.A. Pinilla C. Blondelle S.E. Appel J.R. Dooley C.T. Cuervo J.H. Nature. 1991; 354: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The peptide combinatorial library consisted of 400 separate hexapeptide mixtures having a COOH-terminal amide and an acetylated NH2 terminus. Each mixture (represented by the formula Ac-OOXXXX-NH2) had the first two positions defined with one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids (referred to as “O”) and the remaining four positions are close to equimolar mixtures of 19 of the naturally occurring amino acids (referred to as “X,” cysteine was omitted). The peptide mixtures were screened for the ability to inhibit cdk2-cyclin A activity. As shown in Table 1 a number of peptide mixtures assayed were found to have significant inhibitory activity. From these assays the peptide mixture Ac-RWXXXX-NH2 was selected for further deconvolution. Furthermore, from this initial screening we learned that the presence of positive charges at the NH2 terminus of the peptide mixtures was recognized as one of the characteristic of all of the most active peptide mixtures, thus we decided to proceed with the deconvolution process using a non-acetylated version of the initial library. Moreover, due to the potential interest in performing in vivo studies with the putative inhibitory peptides defined after the deconvolution process, we decided to synthesize the peptide mixtures using the more protease-stable d-stereoisomers of the amino acids (that will be referred here using lowercase letters). Nevertheless, prior to a further deconvolution step we synthesized the peptide mixture rwxxxx-NH2 that was shown to posses an inhibitory activity similar to that of the mixture Ac-RWXXXX-NH2.TABLE 1Iterative process for the peptide combinatorial libraryAc-OOXXXX-NH2rwoxxx-NH2rwioxx-NH2rwimox-NH2rwimyo-NH2SequenceIC50SequenceIC50SequenceIC50SequenceIC50SequenceIC50μg/mlμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlAc-RWXXXX-NH2750rwioxx-NH250rwimxx-NH230rwimyx-NH25rwimyf-NH21.1Ac-HLXXXX-NH2950rwloxx-NH250rwivxx-NH230rwimfx-NH25rwimyc-NH21.0Ac-WRXXXX-NH21075rwfoxx-NH270rwicxx-NH230rwimwx-NH25rwimym-NH21.4Ac-RLXXXX-NH21100rwwoxx-NH2100rwirxx-NH240rwimcx-NH27rwimyi-NH21.8Ac-RMXXXX-NH21150rwnoxx-NH2150rwiixx-NH250Others>10rwimyw-NH21.8Ac-HMXXXX-NH21180rwyoxx-NH2250Others>50Others>2.0Ac-HWXXXX-NH21205Others>250Ac-LKXXXX-NH21280Ac-LHXXXX-NH21470Others>1500 Open table in a new tab To define the third amino acid from the hexapeptide, the library rwoxxx-NH2 (containing 20 different mixtures) was synthesized and screened.

Ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid receptors are primary ligand-gated chloride channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission. Traditionally, these receptors are not considered to be contributors to fluid transport. Here, we report a novel function of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors involving alveolar fluid homeostasis in adult lungs. We demonstrated the expression of functional ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid receptors on the apical plasma membrane of alveolar epithelial type II cells. γ-Aminobutyric acid significantly increased chloride efflux in the isolated type II cells and inhibited apical to basolateral chloride transport on type II cell monolayers. Reduction of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor π subunit using RNA interference abolished the γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated chloride transport. In intact rat lungs, γ-aminobutyric acid inhibited both basal and β agonist-stimulated alveolar fluid clearance. Thus, we provide molecular and pharmacological evidence that ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid receptors contribute to fluid transport in the lung via luminal secretion of chloride.

A functional GABAA receptor is a heteropentamer with at least one α, one β, and one γ or other subunit. The ρ subunit homo- and hetero-pentamers, also known as GABAC receptors consist exclusively of ρ subunits. GABA receptors have been extensively studied in the central nervous system (1Ben Ari Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 728-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar, 2Owens D.F. Kriegstein A.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 3Moss S.J.

However, the functions of GABA receptors in peripheral organs are not fully appreciated. The alveolar epithelium is covered by polarized epithelial type I and type II cells, in which various ion transporters are distributed on apical and basolateral domains. Cl--driven fluid secretion may be required to maintain a thin layer of fluid in the alveoli, which is essential for gas exchange. The Na+-K+-2Cl- co-transporter at the basolateral membrane is responsible for Cl- entry into the cell to accumulate a temporary Cl- gradient for extrusion at the apical side in fetal lung epithelial cells. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has been identified on the apical membrane of adult alveolar epithelial cells and is required for the cAMP-stimulated, but not the basal alveolar fluid clearance (9Fang X. Fukuda N. Barbry P. Sartori C. Verkman A.S. Matthay M.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Brochiero E. Dagenais A. Prive A. Berthiaume Y. Grygorczyk R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L382-L392Google Scholar). However, the Cl- transporters responsible for Cl- efflux in adult alveolar epithelial cells are still unknown. We have previously shown that one of the GABA receptor subunits, π, has a similar expression pattern in cultured alveolar type II cells with the epithelial sodium channel and the CFTR (11Jin N. Narasaraju T. Kolliputi N. Chen J. Liu L. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This suggests that ionotropic GABA receptors may play a role in fluid transport in the lung. In the present study, we showed the expression of functional ionotropic GABA receptors on the apical plasma membrane of alveolar epithelial type II cells. We also provided strong evidence supporting the idea that ionotropic GABA receptors contribute to alveolar fluid homeostasis via luminal secretion of Cl- using freshly isolated and cultured type II cells, as well as anesthetized rats. Taken together, this study supports a novel function of ionotropic GABA receptors in alveolar fluid transport. Cell Isolation and Culture—Alveolar type II cells were isolated from adult rat lungs (∼200 g) as previously described and the purity was ∼85-90% (12Liu L. Wang M. Fisher A.B. Zimmerman U.J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L668-L676PubMed Google Scholar). For the identification of GABA receptor subunits by real-time PCR, highly pure alveolar type I (>90%) and type II cells (95%) were obtained according to our modified methods (13Chen J.W. Chen Z. Narasaraju T. Jin N. Liu L. Lab. Investig. 2004; 84: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For studies in which a confluent cell monolayer was required, cells were plated in transwell collagen-coated inserts at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (14Lee S.Y. Maniak P.J. Rhodes R. Ingbar D.H. O'Grady S.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After overnight culture at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 incubator, non-adherent cells were removed and fresh medium was added only to the outside of the inserts. The cells were cultured in such conditions for an additional 3-4 days until a confluent monolayer was formed. The transepithelial electrical resistance was determined with an EVOM epithelial voltometer and a chopstick electrode (World Precise Instrument, Sarasota, FL). Only those wells that had a transepithelial electrical resistance of >800 ohms cm2 were used for further studies. For studies in which a confluent monolayer was not a prerequisite, cells were plated on 30-mm filter inserts coated with rat tail collagen and Matrigel (4:1, v/v) in a density of 3 × 106 cells/well (15Mason R.J. Lewis M.C. Edeen K.E. McCormick-Shannon K. Nielsen L.D. Shannon J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L249-L258Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DMEM containing 5% rat serum, 10 ng/ml keratinocyte growth factor, 10 nm dexamethasone, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acid, and 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin was used in the culture. Twenty-four h after plating, non-attached cells were removed. Fresh medium, 1.5 and 0.4 ml, was added to the outside and the inside of the insert, respectively. The plates were rotated on a rocking rotator placed in a humidified incubator for 4-5 more days. The resulting cells were used for immunostaining and RNA isolation. Adenoviral RNA Interference Vector Construction and Infection—Adenoviral vectors were constructed as previously described (16Gou D. Narasaraju T. Chintagari N. Jin N. Wang P. Liu L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e134Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Small hairpin RNA sequences were placed under the control of the mouse U6 promoter. After an initial screening of 5 target sequences, the small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequence targeted to rat GABAA receptor π subunit at position 276-294 was found to be the most effective and was used to silence the π subunit. Another siRNA targeted to the 479-497 position had no effect on the expression of the π subunit and was used as a viral control. The titers of the amplified viruses were determined with the Adeno-X™ Rapid Titer Kit (Clontech). Type II cells were cultured on inserts as described above. After overnight culture, non-adherent cells were removed. One ml of fresh media containing adenoviruses (2.5-100 multiplicity of infection or m.o.i.) were added to the inside of the inserts and allowed to slowly leak to the outside by gravity. Twenty-four h later, the virus-containing medium was removed and the cells were maintained at the air-liquid interface with fresh medium. The cultures were continued for 3 more days and the resulting cells were used for immunostaining, RNA isolation, Western blot, and Cl- transport study. Absolute Quantitative Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR was carried out as previously described (11Jin N. Narasaraju T. Kolliputi N. Chen J. Liu L. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from freshly isolated type I and type II cells, cultured type II cells, and whole rat lung and brain tissues. Trace amounts of genomic DNA was removed with DNase I. Thereafter, 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in a total volume of 20 μl with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of 0.5 μg of random hexamers primers. Primers for real-time PCR were designed with Primer Express 1.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). Primer sequences, amplicon Tm, and data acquisition temperature are listed in Table 1. Absolute quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an ABI 7700 system (Applied Biosystems) by using SYBR Green detection. Standard curves were constructed by purified PCR products. The following thermal conditions were used: denaturing at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and data acquisition for 15 s. Data acquisition temperatures were optimized to 2-5 °C lower than the Tm of the amplicon. Dissociation analysis was performed after each run to confirm the specificity of the amplifications. Quantity of mRNA of the GABA receptor subunits was normalized to 18 S rRNA.TABLE 1Primers used for real-time PCR for GABA receptor subunitsSubunitDirectionPrimer sequenceStart baseAmplicon TmData acquisition°Cα1Forward5′–AGAAGTCAAGCCTGAGACAAAACC–3′124878.776Reverse5′–CAAATAGCAGCGGAAAGGCTATT–3′1348α2Forward5′–TCTGGACTCCTGACACCTTCTTT–3′30578.676Reverse5′–CAATGTTCCGTCATCCTGGATT–3′405α3Forward5′–GTGTCAGCAAGGTTGACAAAATTT–3′155178.776Reverse5′–AGCGGATTCCCTGTTCACATAT–3′1651α4Forward5′–CAGGAGTCTTCTGAAACCACTCCT–3′134080.276Reverse5′–GACCTCTTGCTGCTGCAGAGATA–3′1442α5Forward5′–TTTCAATCTAGTTTACTGGGCAACA–3′160476.276Reverse5′–CATTTCTGTGCAAGTATGGTTTCC–3′1704α6Forward5′–CTCTACCCAAAGTGTCCTATGCAA–3′124478.076Reverse5′–GTAGTTGACAGCTGCGAATTCAAT–3′1344β1Forward5′–ATACCCTCTGGATGAGCAAAACTG–3′57877.776Reverse5′–TTACTGCTCCCTCTCCTCCATTC–3′678β2Forward5′–CTTCTGGAATATGCTTTGGTCAACT–3′103478.376Reverse5′–ATCTTCTCGTTGTTGGCATTAGC–3′1134β3Forward5′–TCAACACTCACCTTCGAGAGACTCT–3′93678.478Reverse5′–CAGAAGTGCCAGGAATACAAAGAC–3′1036γ1Forward5′–AGACGGATGGGCTATTTCACAAT–3′90177.276Reverse5′–GCAGGTACAGCATCTTTGTTGATC–3′1001γ2Forward5′–ATGGACTCCTATGCTCGGATCTT–3′136277.576Reverse5′–ATAAAACCCAAACCTCCTCACAGA–3′1462γ3Forward5′–AAAATTCAGTTGAGGCAGCTGAT–3′79078.976Reverse5′–ACCTGCAGATGTTGTCACGATT–3′890δForward5′–ATGCTGACTACAGGAAGAAACGG–3′103180.576Reverse5′–AGCAGAGAGGGAGAAGAGGACAA–3′1131θForward5′–GTCCTGACTACCATCGACTCACAT–3′90178.776Reverse5′–CTTGGCTGAAGAAAAGGTAGTTGAT–3′1051ϵForward5′–CTCAATTTTCCAATGGATTCTCACT–3′207075.073Reverse5′–TTGAGTTTGAAATTCTCCCACTTG–3′2170πForward5′–AAATTTCTGGCGACAATGTCAACTA–3′116077.274Reverse5′–GTAATCAATGATTCTGCCGATCTTT–3′1260ρ1Forward5′–TGGTCATAAAAAGAGCTATTTGCAA–3′299174.673Reverse5′–GAACGGTCATTTTGAAAATCAATG–3′3142ρ2Forward5′–CATCTACCTCTGGGTCAGCTTTG–3′114379.776Reverse5′–GCTTCCGTTCCTTCTGTTCCT–3′1243ρ3Forward5′–TTATCTCAGGCACTATTGGAAGGAT–3′51076.773Reverse5′–GCACCCAAATCTTTTGAATCAATC–3′61018 S rRNAForward5′–TCCCAGTAAGTGCGGGTCATA–3′165580.778Reverse5′–CGAGGGCCTCACTAAACCATC–3′1755 Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitation—This was done using the Seize Classic Mammalian immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). Freshly isolated type II cells (∼107 cells) were homogenized on ice with 100 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% sodium azide). After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, 30 μg of the protein was incubated with goat anti-GABAA receptor γ2 subunit (3 μg) at 4 °C overnight with rotation. The protein-antibody complex was further incubated with protein A/G-agarose gel (35 μl) for 2 h. After being washed with the immunoprecipitation buffer, the protein bound to the beads was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.5, neutralized to pH 7.5 with 1.0 m Tris, pH 7.5, and then analyzed with Western blot to detect α1, α3, β2, γ2, π, and δ subunits. Membrane Protein Biotinylation—To assess the polarity of the GABAA receptors on type II cell membranes, the biotinylation of cell membrane proteins was performed as previously described (17Roux J. Kawakatsu H. Gartland B. Pespeni M. Sheppard D. Matthay M.A. Canessa C.M. Pittet J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18579-18589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, type II cells were maintained on an air-liquid culture system for 5-6 days until a monolayer was formed. After washing the inserts gently with cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer, EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin reagent was added to either the apical or basolateral side of the inserts. The cells were incubated on ice for 1 h, harvested, and resuspended in lysis buffer. The biotinylated proteins were collected by incubating the lysate with streptavidin-agarose beads at 4 °C overnight. The beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. The supernatant containing the biotinylated proteins were analyzed by Western blot using anti-GABAA receptor π subunit antibodies. To make sure that the biotinylation did not occur on cytosolic proteins, β actin was used as a control. Western Blot—This was done as previously described (11Jin N. Narasaraju T. Kolliputi N. Chen J. Liu L. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 321: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were: goat anti-GABAA receptor subunit, α1 (1:100, Abcam), α3 (1:100, Santa Cruz), β2 (1:200, Chemicon), γ2 (1:100, Abcam), π (1:50, Santa Cruz), and δ (1:100, Abcam), anti-GAD65/67 (1:1000, Abcam), anti-GABA (1:200, Abcam), anti-β-actin (1:1000), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:4000). The secondary antibody dilutions were 1:1,000-1:5,000. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. Immunostaining—Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry were performed as previously described (18Narasaraju T.A. Jin N. Narendranath C.R. Chen Z. Gou D. Liu L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L1037-L1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To reveal the localization of GABA, the lung tissue slides were double-labeled with rabbit anti-GABA and monoclonal anti-LB-180 antibodies, followed by incubation with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-goat IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. To show the localization of GAD, the lung tissue slides were double-labeled with rabbit anti-GAD65/67 and anti-LB-180 antibodies, followed by incubation with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-goat IgG and Alexa 633-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. To determine the silencing effects by siRNA, type II cells cultured on the inserts were double-labeled with goat anti-GABAA receptor π subunit and anti-LB-180 antibodies, followed by incubation with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-goat IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. To show whether tight junctions were formed on the siRNA-treated cells, type II cells on the inserts were labeled with monoclonal anti-zonula occludens-1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The dilutions of all the antibodies were 1:200 except for the anti-GABAA receptor π subunit antibody, which was 1:100. 36Cl- Efflux—The Cl- efflux rate from freshly isolated type II cells was assessed as previously reported (19Kemp P.J. Roberts G.C. Boyd C.A. J. Physiol. 1994; 476: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar). The type II cells (12 × 106) were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with 1.2 ml of Ringer's solution (126.4 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.78 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES, 5.55 mm glucose, and 0.075 mm dextran 40, pH 7.4). Then, [36Cl]NaCl (5 μCi/ml) was added and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min. After centrifugation and removing the supernatant, the cells were rapidly washed with cold Ringer's solution 3 times. The cells were then resuspended with warm Ringer's solution with or without various drugs for up to 10 min. 200 μl of the cells were quickly removed every 2 min and centrifuged through 200 μl of silicone oil (40% silicone fluid DC 550 plus 60% dinonyl phthalate) at 1,000 × g for 20 s. The tubes were frozen at -20 °C. The tips containing the cell pellets were cut off from the microtubes and the cells were lysed with 200 μl of 1% SDS. Protein amounts and 36Cl- radioactivity of the cells were determined by a Dc assay and a liquid scintillation counter, respectively. The amounts of cellular 36Cl- (nanomole/mg of protein) at different time points were expressed as a percentage of the 0 time value, and their logarithmic values versus time was plotted. The 36Cl- efflux rate coefficient (nanomole/mg/min) was determined by linear regression analysis. The Cl- efflux studies on cultured cells were carried out as follows. By the end of the RNA interference treatment, type II cells on the inserts were washed with warm DMEM. The cells were loaded with 36Cl- by incubating with DMEM containing 5 μCi/ml of [36Cl]NaCl at 37 °C for 30 min. After removing the “hot” media, the cells were rapidly washed with 3 ml of ice-cold DMEM 4 times. Washing solutions were removed rapidly by aspiration and warm DMEM or DMEM containing GABA was added immediately. After 10 min, the medium was aspirated. The cells were lysed with 1% SDS and specific radioactivity was determined as described above. Unidirectional Cl- Transport—The Cl- transport across the type II cell monolayer was determined on 0.33-cm2 transwell inserts according to the reported method (20Kim K.J. Cheek J.M. Crandall E.D.

[36Cl-]NaCl and [14C]mannitol (1 μCi/ml each) were added to only one side of the insert and incubated for up to 1 h. Fifty μl of solution was removed every 10 min from another side and the same volume of fresh media was added back. Radioactivity of 36Cl- and 14C in the collections was determined and the accumulations of isotopes against time were estimated by linear regression analysis, which represent total 36Cl- paracellular transport. The transepithelial 36Cl- transport was calculated by subtracting the paracellular transport from the total 36Cl- transport. Synthesis of Conjugated GABA—Conjugation of GABA to bovine serum albumin (BSA) was carried out using glutaraldehyde as the cross-linker as previously described (21Meyer K.H. Behringer D.M. Veh R.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). GABA (515 mg) in 3 ml of 1 m sodium acetate was incubated with 2 ml of 25% glutaraldehyde solution at room temperature with slow stirring for 30 s. BSA (500 mg) in 5 ml of 1 m sodium acetate was added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. Fifty mg of NaBH4 was then added to saturate the double bonds and the resulting products were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate at 4 °C overnight with several changes. For the control, BSA conjugate was generated by the same reaction except for omitting GABA. Alveolar Fluid Clearance (AFC) in Anesthetized Rats—AFC was measured as described (22Norlin A. Lu L.N. Guggino S.E. Matthay M.A. Folkesson H.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All the experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Oklahoma State University. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (270-350 g) were housed for 1 week before the experiment. The rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). A tracheotomy was performed and the lungs were ventilated (CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA) with 100% oxygen for 30 min. The tidal volume was maintained at 8 ml/kg by adjusting the flow rate at 1.7-2.5 ml/min. The respiratory rate was 50 times/min. The rat body temperature was maintained at 37 °C with an external heating lamp and a warming pad. After the equilibration period, a 22-gauge catheter was inserted through the incised trachea into the left bronchia and then the ventilation was continued. The rats were changed to a left-side laying position and the bodies were elevated to an upright angle of 45 °C. Pre-warmed 5% BSA in normal saline (3 ml/kg body weight) was delivered through the catheter into the left lungs with a syringe pump (Kent Sciences, Torrington, CT) at a rate of 66 μl/min. In some experiments, drugs were included in the instillate and listed as follows: 100 μm picrotoxin, bicuculine, TPMPA, or glybenclamide, and/or 300 μm GABA. In other experiments, GABA conjugate or BSA conjugate was included in the 5% BSA instillate and their volume was ∼15 μl/rat. In some experiments, 300 μm GABA was injected into the rat tail vein while 5% BSA was instilled into the rat lung. Upon completion of instillation, ventilation was continued for 1 h. The rats were then exsanguinated by transaction of the renal artery. The chests were opened and the right bronchia were tightened. A sample of the remaining alveolar fluid was removed from the left lung with a syringe. The fluid was briefly centrifuged to remove cell debris. Protein concentration of the instillate (Ci) and the final alveolar fluid (Cf) were determined by using the Dc protein assay. The AFC% was calculated by: AFC% = [(Cf - Ci)/Cf] × 100%. Statistics—All the data shown are mean ± S.E. from at least 3 independent experiments. Variance among different groups was analyzed by a Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed with Dunnett's or Fisher's Least Significance Difference multiple comparison methods. Significance was considered when p < 0.05. We first carried out a systematic survey of the mRNA expression of 19 subunits of the ionotropic GABA receptors (α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, δ, θ, ϵ, π, and ρ1-3) in alveolar epithelial cells by using quantitative real-time PCR. The mRNAs of multiple GABA receptor subunits were expressed in rat lungs, type I cells, and type II cells, including α1, α3, α4, α6, β2, γ3, δ, ϵ, π, and ρ1-3 subunits (Fig. 1a). The γ2 subunit was present in type II cells, but not in type I cells. The abundance of the π subunit was ∼10 times higher in type II cells than in type I cells and ∼3 times higher than in the lung tissue. The α2 and β1 subunits were only detected in type I cells. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed to identify the composition of native receptors in type II cells. The α1, α3, β2, and π subunits were co-precipitated with the γ2 subunit; however, the δ subunit was absent in the immunoprecipitate as determined by Western blot using chemiluminescence. This signal was not detectable even after a prolonged exposure of up to 30 min. The immunoprecipitation was specific because pre-immune serum did not pull down any subunits (Fig. 1b). The results suggest that the native GABA receptors in type II cells likely contain γ2, β2, π, α1, and/or α3 subunits. However, we cannot exclude other possible combinations that do not contain γ2 subunit because additional subunits exist in type II cells. The localization of the receptor on cell membrane appears to be on the apical side of type II cell membrane because the π subunit was detected on the apical, but not the basolateral membrane by using biotinylation analysis (17Roux J. Kawakatsu H. Gartland B. Pespeni M. Sheppard D. Matthay M.A. Canessa C.M. Pittet J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18579-18589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The biotinylation was specific to the membrane proteins because β actin was only detected in the whole cell lysate, but not in the biotinylated proteins (Fig. 1c). It should be noted that biotinylation analysis cannot detect the intracellular pool of GABA receptors. Next, we determined whether the physiological ligand of GABA receptors, GABA, is synthesized locally in the lung. Immunostaining revealed that GABA was co-localized with LB-180, the type II cell marker, in the cuboidal cells at the corners of the alveoli (Fig. 2a). The squamous type I cells did not show any positive signals. To further identify the source of GABA in alveolar epithelial cells, we also examined the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in the lung. GAD is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of GABA. As shown in Fig. 2b, GAD was also expressed specifically in type II cells, but not in type I cells. No signals were detected when primary antibodies for GAD or GABA were omitted (data not shown). The GAD expression in type II cells was confirmed by Western blot, in which GAD protein was enriched in type II cells in comparison with whole lungs (Fig. 2c). To examine whether ionotropic GABA receptors in type II cells were functional, we determined the effect of GABA on Cl- efflux in freshly isolated type II cells. At 100 μm, GABA significantly increased the 36Cl- efflux rate from 0.0542 ± 0.009 to 0.099 ± 0.0129 nmol/min/mg (Fig. 3a). Pretreatment of the cells with picrotoxin, an antagonist of GABA receptors, reduced the 36Cl- efflux rate to below the basal level (Fig. 3b). The GABA-mediated 36Cl- efflux was not due to other channels because bumetanide, the Na+-K+-2Cl- co-transporter inhibitor, glybenclamide, an inhibitor of the CFTR, and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, a general inhibitor of anion channels, had no effect on the GABA-mediated 36Cl- efflux (Fig. 3b). The effect of GABA on Cl- transport across the type II cell monolayer was also examined. Type II cells were cultured on an air-liquid culture system to maintain their phenotypes (14Lee S.Y. Maniak P.J. Rhodes R. Ingbar D.H. O'Grady S.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cl- transport from the apical to basolateral side or from the basolateral to apical side was linear within 1 h (Fig. 4, a and b). The basal transport rate of transcellular Cl- was 0.18 ± 0.04 nCi/h from the apical to basolateral side and 0.08 ± 0.04 nCi/h from the opposite direction. The paracellular Cl- transport rate, as determined by [14C]mannitol, was <10% of the total Cl- transport (transcellular plus paracellular) from both directions. The addition of GABA to the apical side of the cells did not change the paracellular Cl- transport; however, the transcellular Cl- transport was inhibited by ∼40% in comparison to the control (Fig. 4c). When the cells were preincubated with picrotoxin, GABA failed to decrease the apical to basolateral Cl- transport. GABA had no effect on the basolateral to apical Cl- transport (Fig. 4b). The addition of isoproterenol, a β agonist, to the basolateral side of type II cell monolayers increased the apical to basolateral Cl- transport by ∼60%. Glybenclamide, the known CFTR inhibitor, blocked the isoproterenol effect, consisten"
https://openalex.org/W2074477598,"Polyhomeotic-like 3 (PHC3) is a ubiquitously expressed member of the polycomb gene family and part of the human polycomb complex hPRC-H. We found that in normal cells PHC3 associated with both hPRC-H complex components and with the transcription factor E2F6. In differentiating and confluent cells, PHC3 and E2F6 showed nuclear colocalization in a punctate pattern that resembled the binding of polycomb bodies to heterochromatin. This punctate pattern was not seen in proliferating cells suggesting that PHC3 may be part of an E2F6-polycomb complex that has been shown to occupy and silence target promoters in G(0). Previous loss of heterozygosity (LoH) analyses had shown that the region containing PHC3 underwent frequent LoH in primary human osteosarcoma tumors. When we examined normal bone and human osteosarcoma tumors, we found loss of PHC3 expression in 36 of 56 osteosarcoma tumors. Sequence analysis revealed that PHC3 was mutated in nine of 15 primary osteosarcoma tumors. These findings suggest that loss of PHC3 may favor tumorigenesis by potentially disrupting the ability of cells to remain in G(0)."
https://openalex.org/W1990484394,"p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is a mediator of downstream signaling from the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. In its inactive state, PAK1 forms a homodimer where two kinases inhibit each other in trans. The kinase inhibitory domain (KID) of one molecule of PAK1 binds to the kinase domain of its counterpart and keeps it inactive. Therefore, the isolated KID of PAK1 has been widely used to specifically inhibit and study PAK function. Here, we show that the isolated KID induced a cell cycle arrest with accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with an inhibition of cyclin D1 and D2 expression. This cell cycle arrest required the intact KID and was also induced by a mutated KID unable to block PAK1 kinase activity. Furthermore, the KID-induced cell cycle arrest could not be rescued by the expression of a constitutively active PAK1-T423E mutant, concluding that this arrest occurs independently of PAK1 kinase activity. Our results suggest that PAK1 through its KID inhibits cyclin D expression and thereby enforces a cell cycle arrest. Our results also call for serious precaution in the use of KID to study PAK function."
https://openalex.org/W2042042150,"Certain chromosome rearrangements display a significant delay in chromosome replication timing (DRT) that is associated with a subsequent delay in mitotic chromosome condensation (DMC). DRT/DMC chromosomes are common in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo and occur frequently in cells exposed to ionizing radiation. A hallmark for these chromosomes is the delayed phosphorylation of serine 10 of histone H3 during mitosis. The chromosome passenger complex, consisting of multiple proteins including Aurora B kinase and INCENP is thought to be responsible for H3 phosphorylation, chromosome condensation and the subsequent segregation of chromosomes. In this report, we show that chromosomes with DRT/DMC contain phosphorylated Chk1, consistent with activation of the S–M phase checkpoint. Furthermore, we show that INCENP is recruited to the DRT/DMC chromosomes during all phases of mitosis. In contrast, Aurora B kinase is absent on DRT/DMC chromosomes when these chromosomes lack serine 10 phosphorylation of H3. We also show that mitotic arrest deficient 2 (Mad2), a member of the spindle assembly checkpoint, is present on DRT/DMC chromosomes at a time when the normally condensed chromosomes show no Mad2 staining, indicating that DRT/DMC activates the spindle assembly checkpoint. Finally, cells with DRT/DMC chromosomes have centrosome amplification, abnormal spindle assembly, endoreduplication and significant chromosome instability."
https://openalex.org/W1987766864,"Gephyrin is an ubiquitously expressed protein that, in the nervous system, is essential for synaptic anchoring of glycine receptors (GlyRs) and major GABAA receptor subtypes. The binding of gephyrin to the GlyR depends on an amphipathic motif within the large intracellular loop of the GlyRβ subunit. The mouse gephyrin gene consists of 30 exons. Ten of these exons, encoding cassettes of 5–40 amino acids, are subject to alternative splicing (C1–C7, C4′–C6′). Since one of the cassettes, C5′, has recently been reported to exclude GlyRs from GABAergic synapses, we investigated which cassettes are found in gephyrin associated with the GlyR. Gephyrin variants were purified from rat spinal cord, brain, and liver by binding to the glutathione S-transferase-tagged GlyRβ loop or copurified with native GlyR from spinal cord by affinity chromatography and analyzed by mass spectrometry. In addition to C2 and C6′, already known to be prominent, C4 was found to be abundant in gephyrin from all tissues examined. The nonneuronal cassette C3 was easily detected in liver but not in GlyR-associated gephyrin from spinal cord. C5 was present in brain and spinal cord polypeptides, whereas C5′ was coisolated mainly from liver. Notably C5′-containing gephyrin bound to the GlyRβ loop, inconsistent with its proposed selectivity for GABAA receptors.

These receptors are clustered in the postsynaptic membrane by the receptor-anchoring protein gephyrin (1Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P.

The gephyrin protein is composed of a N-terminal G-domain that is homologous to the E. coli MogA protein, a central linker region, and a C-terminal E-domain with homology to the E. coli MoeA protein.

The proteins GST, GlyRβ-(378–426)-GST, E-domain-GST, and His-gephyrin-P1 were produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Merck). Expression was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C overnight. Clear lysates were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). His-tagged gephyrin-P1 was purified according to standard protocols (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The GST pull-down procedure was performed at 4 °C as follows: 30-μl bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated with 0.2–0.5 ml of clear bacterial lysate for 2 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the beads were incubated with 7.5 ml of a Triton X-100 extract prepared from rat brain, liver, or spinal cord for 2 h and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. The beads were eluted three times with 30 μl each of 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, for 10 min at 25 °C under vigorous mixing. The eluates were combined. Preparation of Tissue Extracts—Triton X-100 extracts were prepared by adding 5 volumes of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (complete; Roche Applied Science) and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to the tissue followed by homogenization for 3 min at 1000 rpm on ice using a Potter homogenizer (Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany). The homogenate then was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To the supernatant, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and dithiothreitol was added to 1 mm. After 75 min under mild mixing at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used directly in the GST pull-down. GlyR-associated gephyrin was copurified with the glycine receptor from spinal cord using an aminostrychnine column as described (14Pfeiffer F. Graham D. Betz H. J. Biol.

Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry—To the samples, reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added, followed by incubation for 5 min at 48 °C for the GlyR-associated gephyrin or at 95 °C for gephyrin purified via GST pull-down. The samples were resolved on one-dimensional 8–10% polyacrylamide gels. To visualize proteins, gels were silver-stained with a Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad). Gephyrin bands were identified by size (see Fig. 1), cut out, and stored at –80 °C. The protein bands were destained with 100 μl of 15 mm potassium ferricyanide III and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate, followed by two washes with 400 μl of H2O for 15 min and two washes with 400 μl of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, for 15 min. Subsequent preparation of the samples for mass spectrometry was essentially performed as described (22Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7818) Google Scholar). After trypsin digestion, the samples were spun in a table-top microcentrifuge. The aqueous solution was collected, and the gel pieces were extracted once for 45 min with 20 mm NH4HCO3. After brief centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, followed by extraction of the gel pieces for 30 min with 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, 5% (v/v) formic acid. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was combined with the two previous supernatants from the same sample. The combined extracts were dried in a SpeedVac and stored at –20 °C until mass spectrometric analysis. Mass Spectrometry—All MS experiments were performed on the Voyager-DE™ STR (Applied Biosystems, MDS SCIEX). Additionally, MS/MS spectra were acquired with the 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF™ analyzer (Applied Biosystems, MDS SCIEX) to verify the MS data. Prior to analysis, the pellets were dissolved in 5 μl of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid under mixing for 3 h. The sample (0.4 μl) was mixed with 0.4 μl of matrix (5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid; Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid directly on a stainless steel target (Applied Biosystems, MDS SCIEX) and dried in ambient air. The crystals were washed briefly with 1 μl of ice-cold 5% (v/v) formic acid. The acquisition range for the MS analysis was set from 600 to 5000 Da, and the low mass gate was set to 500 Da. The spectra were first externally calibrated using a peptide mass mixture (Peptide Calibration Standard II, Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). Trypsin autolysis peaks and prominent gephyrin peaks were then used for internal calibration. Between 400 and 1000 single scans were accumulated for each mass spectrum. Representative spectra are shown in Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1. Selected peaks characterizing the gephyrin splice variants were fragmented to get sequence information (see supplemental Fig. 3 and supplemental Table 1). Analysis of Mass Spectrometric Data—All MS spectra were smoothed, noise-filtered, and deisotoped using the Data Explorer™ software (Applied Biosystems, MDS SCIEX). Deisotoped peaks were automatically labeled by the software, and the peaks were used for data base search. Gephyrin was identified using Mascot™ (23Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6773) Google Scholar) and MS-Fit (Expasy) via World Wide Web interface. Gephyrin splice variants not present in the NCBI and Swiss-Prot data bases were generated in silico. The presence and absence of the cassettes was determined using the World Wide Web-based FindMod (24Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Gooley A.A. Herbert B.R. Molloy M.P. Binz P.A. Ou K. Sanchez J.C. Bairoch A. Williams K.L. Hochstrasser D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For all cassettes, Aldente (Expasy) was used to identify false positive results due to keratin contamination. Additionally, the cassettes were checked for trypsin (25Harris W.A. Janecki D.J. Reilly J.P. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 16: 1714-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and other common contaminations (26Ding Q. Xiao L. Xiong S. Jia Y. Que H. Guo Y. Liu S. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). FindMod was also used to check for GlyR contamination in GlyR-associated gephyrin and for GlyRβ-(378–426)-GST in case of the other gephyrin protein bands. MS/MS spectra were processed similarly and searched against the NCBI data base. Mass accuracy was set to 50 ppm for the precursor and 0.25 Da for the fragments. Unidentified spectra of splice variants were interpreted manually. Determination of Gephyrin Cassette Boundaries at the Amino Acid Level—The genomic rat and mouse sequences containing the gephyrin gene were obtained from the genome data bases (NCBI). Using the published gephyrin cDNA sequences and the intronexon boundaries described (6Ramming M. Kins S. Werner N. Hermann A. Betz H. Kirsch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the exact sequence of all cassettes, except for C1, could be verified. Since the genomic rat sequence is apparently incomplete, the mouse sequence was used when no published rat sequence was available, such as for C6 and C7. Statistical Analysis—For all bands examined, 10 independent experiments were performed. The statistical significance of differences between gephyrin protein bands for a given cassette was calculated using Fisher's exact test (27Sachs L. Angewandte Statistik. 6. Ed. Springer Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg/New York/Tokyo1984Crossref Google Scholar). GlyR-associated gephyrin (SC GlyR) was copurified with the GlyR from spinal cord extracts on an aminostrychnine column as described (14Pfeiffer F. Graham D. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9389-9393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schmitt B. Knaus P. Becker C.M. Betz H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Additionally, gephyrin able to interact with the GlyR was isolated from detergent extracts of spinal cord, brain, and liver by a GST pull-down approach with the gephyrin binding motif of GlyRβ (16Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This identified in both brain and spinal cord two major gephyrin bands of different apparent molecular weights in one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which we named brain 93 kDa and brain 90 kDa, and SC 93 kDa and SC 90 kDa, respectively (see Fig. 1). Such a separation of gephyrin bands was not seen in liver (see Fig. 1). To reveal whether these gephyrin polypeptides contained different alternatively spliced exons, or cassettes, the individual bands were cut out and subjected to mass spectrometry. For GlyR-associated gephyrin, the observed upper and lower bands were indistinguishable by mass spectrometry. A representative spectrum of a brain 90 kDa band is shown in Fig. 2 in its raw, deisotopized, and simplified form. Mass spectrometry data for the different gephyrin bands were obtained at comparable quality. For the calculation of average sequence coverage, a reference sequence with the following features was used: rat gephyrin containing cassettes C2 and C6′ (GenBank™ accession number CAA47009), methionine at position 1 replaced by an acetyl group, and alanine at position 242. C2 and C6′ were found in all samples analyzed. Gephyrin without N-terminal modification was found in only 3%, but gephyrin with N-terminal acetylation was found in 95% of the experiments. The N-terminal acetylation was confirmed by MS/MS (see supplemental Fig. 3F and supplemental Table 1). At position 242 of the published rat gephyrin sequence (1Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), an arginine residue is present, whereas in all other mammals an alanine residue is conserved. However, in none of the experiments with the rat strain used (Wistar rats) was an arginine 242 found, but rather, an alanine was found in one-third of the experiments. Reexamination of our original clones (1Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) revealed a sequencing error at position 242 in the published sequence. Deviations of peptide masses within one experiment were determined using Mascot™ (23Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6773) Google Scholar) and MS-Fit (Expasy). The average sequence coverage of the peptide mass fingerprints varied from 44 to 49% (see Fig. 3), a value characteristic of in-gel digests with trypsin. The average deviation was ∼20 ppm (see Fig. 3). This indicates that mass spectrometry results were obtained for all gephyrin protein bands with similar reliability. Under the same conditions, the presence and absence of all cassettes was correctly identified in recombinant gephyrin-P1 and the recombinant E-domain (see supplemental Fig. 2, A and B), whereas no false positive results were obtained from actin and myosin heavy chain 9 copurified as nonspecific proteins with gephyrin from liver (data not shown). The amino acid sequences of different peptides were confirmed by MS/MS (see supplemental Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 3). Only a limited number of theoretically possible peaks identified splice variants; presumably, this reflects difficulties with peptide extraction from the gel, unused cleavage sites, etc. Cassettes C4 and C5 were defined by the presence or absence of a single tryptic fragment. C3 could only be detected with a peak at 1056 Da. Cassettes C2 and C6′ were identified easily because multiple peaks were found in the MS spectra; their identities were verified in MS/MS experiments. Supplemental Fig. 3 shows a selection of the acquired MS/MS spectra. All MS/MS spectra resulted in significant data base identifications except for the peak at 1056 Da found for C3; this is consistent with fragmentations in the low mass region frequently creating only manually interpretable spectra (supplemental Table 1). The presence of the fragments at the hyphenation points of peptide 1056 Da (residues P and D) identified it unambiguously in this special chase (supplemental Fig. 3B). The borderline MS/MS data base identification of the tryptic fragment of cassette C4 (1786.8 Da) must be correct, because the MS/MS spectrum contains a satisfactory y-ion series (supplemental Fig. 3C). Additionally, N-terminal acetylation of gephyrin was proven in an MS/MS experiment (supplemental Fig. 3F). No significant differences were observed for the cassettes located in the E- and G-domain. In all experiments, the presence of the cassettes C2 and C6′ was observed (see Fig. 4), indicating that these cassettes are highly abundant. Additionally, they clearly do not interfere with GlyRβ binding, since they were also present in gephyrin obtained from affinity-purified GlyR preparations (SC GlyR). The GlyR binding site of gephyrin resides in the E-domain (12Sola M. Bavro V.N. Timmins J. Franz T. Ricard-Blum S. Schoehn G. Ruigrok R.W.H. Paarmann I. Saiyed T. O'Sullivan G.A. Schmitt B. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. EMBO Journal. 2004; 23: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast to C2 and C6, cassettes C1, C6, and C7 were hardly or not at all detected (see Table 1). For C1, this might reflect the fact that this is a very rare cassette. In the case of C6, there exists an alternative explanation. Since it is located in the E-domain, it might interfere with GlyR binding. The most prominent feature of C7 is that its presence introduces a translational stop codon after amino acid position 463 in rat gephyrin containing C2 and C6′ (6Ramming M. Kins S. Werner N. Hermann A. Betz H. Kirsch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As a consequence, a major portion of the E-domain containing the GlyR binding site is deleted, and the calculated molecular mass of a gephyrin polypeptide containing C7 is ∼30 kDa smaller as compared with the gephyrin bands investigated in this study. Hence, it should not be contained in the 90–93 kDa bands analyzed here.TABLE 1Cassette detection and exclusion ratesCassetteLiverBrain 93 kDaBrain 90 kDaSC 93 kDaSC 90 kDaSC GlyR%%%%%%C11000000C450100408050100C60000100C7000000ΔC5′100100100100100100ΔC4′C4C5000101010ΔC6801001009060100ΔC7304020301020 Open table in a new tab The presence of C5′ was detected only occasionally. Although C5′ was observed more often in liver as compared with the other bands (see Fig. 4), this difference is not statistically significant (p < 0.25 for SC GlyR). Since C5′ has been reported to interfere with GlyRβ binding (9Meier J. De Chaldee M. Triller A. Vannier C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), its presence in affinity-purified GlyR preparations and GlyRβ-(378–426)-GST pull-downs was a surprising finding. However, binding of C5′-containing gephyrin to the GlyRβ loop used in this study has also been seen recently with the purified recombinant proteins. 3T. Saiyed, personal communication. For precise localization of the cassettes, see Fig. 6. Within the central linker region, differences for most of the cassettes were observed. In contrast to the cassettes C1, C2, C6, and C6′ located within the E- or G-domain, most of the cassettes found in the central linker region were differentially distributed between the bands defined above. C3 was abundantly represented in the liver, brain 93 kDa, and SC 93 kDa bands but not detected in brain 90 kDa, SC 90 kDa, and GlyR-associated gephyrin (see Fig. 5). This difference turned out to be highly significant (p < 0.005). Obviously, C3 does not directly interfere with GlyRβ binding. C3 is largely repressed in neurons by NOVA proteins, neuronal regulators of pre-mRNA splicing (28Ule J. Jensen K.B. Ruggiu M. Mele A. Ule A. Darnell R.B. Science. 2003; 302: 1212-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 29Ule J. Ule A. Spencer J. Williams A. Hu J.S. Cline M. Wang H. Clark T. Fraser C. Ruggiu M. Zeeberg B.R. Kane D. Weinstein J.N. Blume J. Darnell R.B. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), indicating that GlyR-associated gephyrin, brain 90 kDa, and SC 90 kDa are indeed derived from neurons, but brain 93 kDa and SC 93 kDa might originate from nonneuronal (e.g. glial) cells. C3 consists of 36 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular mass of 4 kDa. Therefore, the observed difference in the molecular mass of SC 93 kDa versus SC 90 kDa and of brain 93 kDa versus brain 90 kDa can be easily explained by the presence of the C3 cassette in the bands of higher molecular mass. C4 was readily disclosed in all bands, being most prominent in GlyR-associated gephyrin and brain 93 kDa but significantly less abundant in the SC 90 kDa, brain 90 kDa, and liver isolates (see Table 1). This was the most obvious difference observed between GlyR-associated gephyrin and the SC 90 kDa band (see Fig. 5), suggesting a special importance of the C4 cassette for the GlyR-associated variant (SC GlyR). C4 obviously seems not to impair binding to GlyRβ and might in addition provide some functionally relevant features, such as phosphorylation and protein binding sites. Among the splice variants containing C4, those without C5 were detected most frequently. C4 without C5 was found in significantly higher amounts in GlyR-associated gephyrin as compared with the SC 90 kDa and brain 90 kDa polypeptides (see Fig. 5). The results for"
https://openalex.org/W2036427970,"Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a multifocal neoplasm of the skin that can spread to visceral organs, is the most prevalent malignant tumor in acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8) is considered the primary etiological factor of this malignancy, as well as of primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. KS lesions are characterized by proliferating spindle cells of endothelial cell (EC) origin. The action of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has been implicated in many malignancies, and recent data have demonstrated that the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) is required for in vitro growth of the KS-derived KSIMM cell line. To examine whether the IGF pathway is also involved in KSHV-mediated transformation of ECs, we examined the expression and function of the IGF system in KSHV-infected, immortalized dermal microvascular EC (E-DMVEC). The expression of the insulin receptor (IR) was strongly induced in latently infected E-DMVEC, whereas the expression levels of the IGF-IR remained unchanged. Gene knockdown of IR, but not IGF-IR, prevented the characteristic focus formation seen in KSHV-infected E-DMVEC. Similarly, treatment with the IR-specific small-molecule inhibitor HNMPA-(AM3) inhibited postconfluent growth. These data suggest a role for the IR, but not the IGF-IR, in KSHV-induced transformation of vascular ECs."

In this study, we explored the role of Rabip4 and Rabip4′, two Rab4 effector proteins, in migration of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. In these cells, Rabip4 and Rabip4′, collectively named Rabip4s, were partially co-localized with the early endosomal marker EEA1. PDGF treatment re-distributed endogenous Rabip4s toward the cell periphery where they colocalized with F-actin. In cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rabip4 or GFP-Rabip4′, constitutive appearance of GFP-Rabip4s at the cell periphery was accompanied by local increase in cortical F-actin in membrane ruffles at the leading edge. The expression of GFP-Rabip4 induced an increased migration compared with control cells expressing GFP alone, even in the absence of PDGF stimulation. On the contrary, in cells expressing a mutated form of Rabip4s unable to interact with Rab4, lack of typical leading edge was observed. Furthermore, PDGF treatment did not stimulate the migration of these cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of the expression of Rabip4s inhibited PDGF-stimulated cell migration. Endogenous Rabip4s were localized with αv integrins at the leading edge following PDGF treatment, whereas in cells expressing GFP-Rabip4s, αv integrins, together with GFP-Rabip4s, were constitutively localized at the leading edge. In contrast, reduction in Rabip4s expression levels using small interfering RNA was associated with impaired PDGF-induced translocation of αv integrins toward the leading edge.

Cell migration is a fundamental process that is required during embryonic morphogenesis, tissue repair, and regeneration, as well as, in progression of certain diseases including cancer, mental retardation, atherosclerosis, and arthritis (1Vicente-Manzanares M.

The C-terminal cysteine-rich FYVE finger of Rabip4 can bind PI(3)P in vitro and trigger membrane association of Rabip4, although it is unclear whether this interaction targets Rabip4 to the early endosomes (13Mari M.

The two isoforms of Rabip4, Rabip4 and Rabip4′, which originate from the same gene, have been described (21Fouraux M.A. Deneka M. Ivan V. van der Heijden A.

In the mouse, Rabip4 and Rabip4′ differ by 112 amino acid residues that are present only at the N terminus of Rabip4′ (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that Rabip4 and Rabip4′, Rab4a effectors, might be playing a role in some aspect of intracellular trafficking during cell adhesion and migration.In the present study, we characterized the intracellular distribution of endogenous Rabip4 isoforms, collectively named Rabip4s, in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence or absence of PDGF stimulation, and we studied the effects of Rabip4s using cells expressing GFP-Rabip4s or the mutated Rabip4s form that is unable to bind Rab4a. In addition, we examined the effects of inhibition of Rabip4s expression levels using small interfering RNA (siRNA). We provide evidence that Rabip4 is involved in migration of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and propose that Rabip4 may be regulating the trafficking of integrins to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Monoclonal antibodies against EEA1, rat anti-mouse CD51 (integrin αv chain), were from BD Biosciences. Monoclonal antibodies against transferrin receptor were from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal antibody against paxillin was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibodies against Myc (9E10) and polyclonal antibodies against extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PDGF-BB was obtained from Pepro Tech. Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Polyclonal antibody against Rabip4s was produced as previously described (11Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), Texas Red-conjugated, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Monoclonal antibody against tubulin (clone DM1A) was obtained from Sigma. Other chemicals were from Sigma, and molecular biology reagents were from New England BioLabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA), Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), or Qiagen (Hilden, Germany).cDNA Constructs—The construction of pEGFP-Rabip4 and pEGFP-Rabip4Δ-(507-517) was previously described (11Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Mari M. Macia E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Cormont M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42501-42508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These construction vectors allow for the expression of Rabip4 or a Rabip4 form that is unable to interact with Rab4, as a C-terminal fusion with GFP. For the cloning of Rabip4′, a mouse heart cDNA λTRIPLEX phage library (Clontech) was screened using as a probe a cDNA corresponding to the amino acid sequence 401-507 of Rabip4. Positive clones were selected after 3 screening rounds. The corresponding phages were used to infect Escherichia coli strain BM25.8 to transform phages into plasmids, before sequencing the inserted cDNA. The cDNA sequence of Rabip4 with a 5′ extension was subcloned in-frame with the 3′ region of Rabip4 into pcDNA3 and pEGFP vectors. This cDNA encodes for Rabip4′.Cells and Transfections—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 7% CO2. For cDNA transfections, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected once they achieved 70-80% confluence with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) or jetPEI™ (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France), as indicated by the manufacturer. One day following transfection, cells were passaged (50,000 cells per well) onto glass coverslips of a 12-well plate that was pre-coated with 20 μg/ml fibronectin overnight at 4 °C, blocked with 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C, and rinsed twice with PBS. Transfected cells were used 48 h following transfection and the transfection procedures led to 10-30% efficiency. Prior to each experiment, cells were serum deprived for 30 min with DMEM containing 1% FCS and were then treated with 20 ng/ml PDGF for 60 min. For Rabip4s siRNA experiments, cells were transfected by electroporation using the Nucleofector Kit R Solution (Amaxa Biosystems), as indicated by the manufacturer. Cells were transfected using 1.5 μg of non-targeting (control) or siRNA against Rabip4s and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C prior to further analysis. The siRNA sequences against Rabip4 and Rabip4′ were as following: sense 5′-CAAGCAGCTCCTAAGTGAGTT-3′ and antisense 5′-CTCACTTAGGAGCTGCTTGTT-3′.Cell Fractionation—NIH 3T3 cells were harvested and homogenized in 250 μl of cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 5 mm sucrose and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Diagnostics). Cells were broken by 20 passages through a 22-gauge needle and centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g at 4 °C to generate a postnuclear supernatant. A highspeed supernatant (cytosol) and a membrane pellet were obtained following centrifugation of the postnuclear supernatant for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C (Optima X100 ultracentrifuge, Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Proteins from equal volumes of cytosol and membrane-associated fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Rabip4 antibodies.Immunofluorescence Confocal Analysis—Cells grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Following neutralization with 10 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 15 min, cells were washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. To detect GFP fusion proteins, cells were directly mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). To detect endogenous Rabip4s as well as integrins, EEA1, paxillin, or transferrin receptor coverslips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate primary antibodies diluted in permeabilization buffer. Following three washes with PBS, coverslips were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. Coverslips were finally mounted in Mowiol 4-88 on glass slides. Cells were then examined by sequential excitation (MultiTrack option) at 488 (GFP and FITC) and 568 nm (Texas Red) using a scanning confocal fluorescence microscope with a PL APO 63 × 1.40 oil objective (LSM 510, Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). The images were combined and merged using Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Intensity profiles were determined by using LSM Image Browser.Time Lapse Imaging—Cells plated on fibronectin-coated 35-mm dishes and incubated in DMEM containing 1% FCS were filmed for 4 h before and after the addition of 20 ng/ml PDGF under 5% CO2, 37 °C. Cells were observed by phase-contrast optics using a fully motorized Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) and a cooled digital CCD camera (CoolSnap HQ, Roper Scientific, Evry, France) using ×20 lens objective. Images were recorded at 1 frame/30 s and processed using MetaMorph 2.0 image analysis software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) and QuickTime software (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA). Migration tracks of individual cells and their length were determined using the plugging “manual tracking” of the ImageJ software. The nucleus position of a particular cell in a constant field among all the conditions filmed is defined every 10 min.Cell Migration Assay—Cells transfected with siRNA were washed twice with PBS, detached with trypsin, and resuspended (2.0 × 105 cells/ml) in DMEM containing 1% FCS. A suspension (0.5 ml) of cells was pipetted onto a fibronectincoated Transwell insert (8-μm pores) and incubated (24 h) at 37 °C. After incubation, non-migratory fibroblasts were removed carefully from the upper face of the Transwell chambers with a cotton swab. Transwell membranes were fixed in 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and stained with crystal violet. Cells (blue) that had migrated and adhered to the Transwell membrane were microscopically counted. Multiple fields (up to 10) were counted per membrane using a ×20 objective.RESULTSEndogenous Rabip4s Translocate to the Cell Periphery of NIH 3T3 Fibroblasts following PDGF Treatment—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were subjected to fractionation and immunoblotting using antibodies developed previously against the C-terminal part of Rabip4 (11Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The antibodies detected both Rabip4 isoforms in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, Rabip4 and Rabip4′, which differ by the presence of N-terminal 112 amino acid residues within Rabip4′, as observed earlier in other cell types (22Monzo P. Mari M. Kaddai V. Gonzales T. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Cormont M. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 107-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The endogenous Rabip4s were detected both in cytosolic and membrane-associated fractions (Fig. 1A). We next analyzed the subcellular localization of endogenous Rabip4s. Under basal conditions, endogenous Rabip4s were mainly localized in punctuate spots enriched in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1B). Rabip4s partially co-localized with a marker of early endosomes, EEA1 in this region, indicating that, in fibroblasts, Rabip4s are likely localized to early endosomes, as previously reported for the expressed Rabip4 in other cell types (11Cormont M.

Co-localization between Rabip4s and transferrin receptors, the marker of recycling endosomes, was observed only around certain transferrin receptor-positive vesicles. Importantly, following PDGF treatment, in addition to perinuclear localization, Rabip4s were also detected at the cell periphery (Fig. 1C, right panel) in the majority of cells (Fig. 1D).Because previous work reported Rab4a dependence in cell adhesion (8Roberts M. Barry S. Woods A. van der Sluijs P. Norman J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), we next decided to characterize intracellular localization of endogenous Rabip4s during cell adhesion. To do this, we checked co-localization of endogenous Rabip4s with focal adhesion marker, paxillin, and F-actin, after allowing cells to adhere onto fibronectin-coated coverlips in the presence of PDGF for 60 min. Rabip4s were not significantly co-localized with paxillin at the cell periphery although they appeared in close proximity (Fig. 2A, top). However, Rabip4s were significantly co-localized with F-actin at the cell periphery during cell adhesion (Fig. 2A, bottom). The presence of Rabip4s at the cell periphery was observed whether cells were allowed to adhere in the presence (Fig. 2A) or absence of PDGF (data not shown) indicating that Rabip4s-containing vesicles are likely targeted toward the sites at the cell periphery where initial events of cell adhesion occur. Similarly, in adhering cells that were subsequently stimulated with PDGF for 60 min, Rabip4s detected at the periphery of the cell were also co-localized with F-actin, indicating that Rabip4s are present at the PDGF-induced leading edge of migrating fibroblasts (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Rabip4s co-localize with F-actin at the cell periphery. A, cells were trypsinized, plated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips, allowed to adhere for 60 min in the presence of 20 ng/ml PDGF, fixed, and permeabilized. Polyclonal anti-Rabip4s and monoclonal anti-paxillin antibodies were used to detect endogenous Rabip4s and paxillin, respectively. Anti-rabbit FITC and anti-mouse Texas Red conjugates were used as secondary antibodies, whereas Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin was used to detect F-actin. Images were captured using a scanning confocal fluorescence microscope and one confocal section for each labeling is shown. Bar, 10 μm. B, cells plated overnight onto fibronectin-coated coverslips were serum deprived for 30 min, incubated in the presence of PDGF for 60 min, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for endogenous Rabip4s and F-actin, as in A.

In cells expressing GFP-Rabip4 or GFP-Rabip4′, Rabip4s could be observed at the cell periphery both under basal conditions (Fig. 3A, top) and following PDGF treatment (Fig. 3A, bottom). The percentage of cells expressing GFP-Rabip4 or GFP-Rabip4′ that presented Rabip4s at the cell periphery under basal conditions was almost equivalent to that observed following PDGF treatment (Fig. 3B). Under basal conditions, in cells expressing GFP-Rabip4, but not in cells expressing GFP alone, cortical F-actin was present in membrane ruffles at the leading edge, and it was significantly co-localized with GFP-Rabip4 (Fig. 3C) or GFP-Rabip4′ (data not shown). Importantly, GFP was not present in the membrane ruffles at the leading edge (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, under basal conditions, the majority of cells expressing GFP-Rabip4 or GFP-Rabip4′, but not cells expressing GFP alone, had cortical F-actin in membrane ruffles at the leading edge (Fig. 3D). Cortical F-actin in membrane ruffles was also observed at the leading edge of PDGF-treated cells expressing GFP-Rabip4s (data not shown). To study the migration of these cells, we next performed time lapse video microscopy experiments, in which cells were filmed for 4 h in the presence or absence of PDGF. Cells that strongly expressed GFP alone (pointed with arrows in Fig. 4A) or GFP-Rabip4 (pointed with arrows in Fig. 4B) were selected in corresponding phase-contrast time frames. The various frames show the position of cells expressing GFP alone or GFP-Rabip4 at 0, 2, and 4 h of incubation in the presence or absence of PDGF. As expected, the migration tracks of cells expressing GFP alone showed that PDGF treatment stimulated the migration of these cells (Fig. 4C, Table 1, and supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Importantly, the migration tracks of cells expressing GFP-Rabip4 showed that the PDGF treatment stimulated cell migration but also that the cells expressing GFP-Rabip4 displayed an increased mobility under basal conditions compared with cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 4C, Table 1, and supplementary Videos 3 and 4). This result corroborates our results showing the increased presence of Rabip4 and F-actin at the leading edge of cells expressing GFP-Rabip4, and suggests that overexpression of Rabip4 may induce cell migration independently of PDGF stimulation.FIGURE 3Overexpression of Rabip4 leads to constitutive appearance of Rabip4 and actin at the leading edge. Cells transiently transfected with pEGFP, pEGFP-Rabip4, or pEGFP-Rabip4′ cDNA were serum deprived for 30 min, incubated in the presence or absence of PDGF for 60 min, fixed, and permeabilized.

Different combinations of NF-κB subunits not only diverge in timing to induce transcription but also recognize varying sequences of the NF-κB-binding site of their target genes. The p52 subunit is generated as a result of processing of NF-κB2 p100. Here, we demonstrate that the non-canonical IκB kinase ϵ (IKKϵ) directly interacts with p100. In a transactivation assay, IKKϵ promoted the ability of p52 to transactivate gene expression. This effect was indirect, requiring p65, which was shown to be part of the IKKϵ-p52 complex and to be phosphorylated by IKKϵ. These novel interactions reveal a hitherto unknown function of IKKϵ in the regulation of the alternative NF-κB activation pathway involving p52 and p65.

The members of the NF-κB transcription factor family activate defense responses against pathogens and cellular stress. A specific response to a stimulus is achieved through differential activation and dimeric complex formation of the five members of this family: NF-κB1 or p105/p50; NF-κB2 or p100/p52; and the Rel subfamily, p65 (also termed RelA), RelB, and c-Rel. Upon pathway activation, the IκB subunits, which mask the Rel transcription activators, become phosphorylated by the IκB kinases (IKKs) 2The abbreviations used are: IKKs, IκB kinases; IL, interleukin; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; IFN, interferon; IRFs, interferon-regulated transcription factors; MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DBD, DNA-binding domain; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. and then ubiquitinated and ultimately degraded (1Siebenlist U.

The active NF-κB subunits are consequently released, translocate to the nucleus as dimers to bind their cognate target sites, and undergo further phosphorylation, which promotes their ability to transactivate gene expression. p50 and p52 are different from the other factors in that their activation is not controlled by IκB subunits but rather by the inhibitory ankyrin repeats in the C termini of their full-length forms, p105 and p100. These inhibitory domains have to be phosphorylated and processed to produce the respective active p50 and p52 forms (1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev.

Signaling events leading to p100 processing have been subject to intensive studies in recent years. Nuclear shuttling has been linked to regulation of p100 processing (28Liao G. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which has also been described to be a co-translational event (29Mordmuller B. Krappmann D. Esen M. Wegener E. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast to the canonical NF-κB p65 pathway, p100 does not employ IKKβ for activation but has instead been shown to be phosphorylated by IKKα in an NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK)-dependent manner (30Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), which is prerequisite for ubiquitination and processing of p100 into p52. Induced and constitutive/pathogenic p100 processing are mechanistically similar. Processing is suppressed by the formation of a presumptive three-dimensional domain consisting of the C terminus, the dimerization domain, and the nuclear translocation domain (31Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Inducible processing is crucially controlled by NIK, which activates IKKα, causing it to phosphorylate p100 (32Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30099-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Constitutive processing also requires phosphorylation by IKKα and is regulated by nuclear shuttling. Different from physiological processing, these pathogenic processing events are NIK-independent (32Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30099-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 33Qing G. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9765-9768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The non-canonical IKKϵ (IKKi) was first described as a lipopolysaccharide-inducible serine/threonine kinase and was hence thought to be essential in the host response against bacterial pathogens (34Shimada T.

Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Expression of IKKϵ is also induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, with preferential expression in thymus, spleen, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (34Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 35Peters R.T. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Mol.

Med. 2004; 199: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). IKKϵ is closely related to the constitutive and ubiquitous TBK-1 (TANK-binding kinase-1) (37Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M. Nakanishi M. Nature. 2000; 404: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and shows structural and sequence homology to IKKα and IKKβ. Both IKKϵ and TBK-1 are downstream kinases in Toll-like receptor pathways and are crucial for regulation of interferon (IFN)-β and IFN-inducible genes (37Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Takeuchi O. Hemmi H. Akira S. J. Endotoxin Res. 2004; 10: 252-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kravchenko V.V. Mathison J.C.

The two kinases share an overlapping substrate specificity for IFN-regulated transcription factors (IRFs), with IKKϵ, preferring IRF-7 over IRF-3 and TBK-1 having the opposite preference (42Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar, 43Sharma S. tenOever B.R.

J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, studies have shown that mice bearing a deletion of the IKKϵ gene respond normally to lipopolysaccharide and double-stranded RNA challenges with respect to activation of IRF-3 and NF-κB (39Takeuchi O. Hemmi H. Akira S. J. Endotoxin Res. 2004; 10: 252-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). This is presumably due to a functional redundancy between IKKϵ and TBK-1. IKKϵ has therefore been linked to the canonical p65/p50 activation pathway and to the Toll-like receptor-3 and -4 pathways to IRFs and IFN-inducible genes (37Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D.

A defect in CCAAA/enhancer-binding protein-δ-regulated gene expression was noted in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IKKϵ-deficient cells (40Kravchenko V.V. Mathison J.C. Schwamborn K. Mercurio F. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26612-26619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible link between the NF-κB and CCAAA/enhancer-binding protein pathways. Here, we demonstrate that IKKϵ can be found in a complex with p52 and p65 and is required for transactivation of gene expression by this complex. We have therefore found a role for IKKϵ in the activation of an NF-κB complex containing p52 and p65. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Reagents—HEK293 and HeLa cell lines were purchased from the Centre for Applied Microbiology & Research (Salisbury, UK). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with a deletion of p65 and the corresponding wild-type MEFs were kindly provided by Ron Hay (University of St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland, UK). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were seeded at 0.5–1 × 105/ml and incubated overnight for experiments. Cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends. Lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli serotype O26:B6 and TNFα were purchased from Sigma. Constructs bearing FLAG-tagged IKKϵ and the construct encoding the kinase activity-impaired mutant IKKϵ(K38A) were kindly provided by Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The TBK-1-encoding plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Makato Nakanishi (National Institute for Longevity Sciences, Aichi, Japan). The constructs encoding IKKα and IKKβ was kindly donated by Tularik (San Francisco, CA). The construct comprising hemagglutinin-tagged p65 was provided by GlaxoSmithKline (Stevenage, UK). The plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged p100 (pRSV-p100) and p52 (pRSV-NF-p52) and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs GST-p65-(1–306) and GST-p65-(428–551) were a kind gift from Neil Perkins (University of Dundee, Scotland). The NF-κB-luciferase construct was a gift from Robert Hofmeister (Universitaet Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany), and the IFN-stimulated response element-luciferase construct was purchased from Clontech. The Gal4-p65 transactivation construct and the Gal4-dependent reporter construct were kindly provided by Lienhard Schmitz (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). For construction of the p52-Gal4 transactivation fusion protein, we used the pAB vector, which was kindly donated by Oliver Schmidt (University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany). p52 was PCR-amplified with a forward primer containing an EcoRI restriction site (5′-AAGAATTCAAGCTTCACCATGG-3′) and a reverse primer containing a BamHI site immediately upstream of the stop codon (5′-CGGGATCCTTCGCGCCCCGCCC-3′). The amplified DNA was then digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the overhangs were filled with Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs Ltd., Herts, UK) and ligated with the blunted BamHI site of the pAB vector. Correct orientation was confirmed by sequencing. Overexpressed p52-Gal4 fusion protein was detected in immunoblots. For construction of the GST-p100 fusion protein, p100 was amplified from plasmid pRSV-p100 with primers bearing a BamHI restriction site (p100 for, 5′-GCGGATCCATGGAGAGTTGCTACAACCCAG-3′l and p100rev, 5′-TATTTGGCGGATCCTTATTTGTCCCAACTGAGGGGTG-3′). p100 was then subcloned into the BamHI site of vector pGEXKG. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The C-terminal portion of IKK3 (amino acids 541–716) was generated by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and primers 5′-CACCCAGCAGATTCAGTGCTGTTTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAGACATCAGGAGGTGCTGG-3′ (reverse) against a full-length IKK3 clone (GlaxoSmithKline). The resulting PCR product was subcloned into the TOPO-pENTR vector (Invitrogen) using the directional TOPO-pENTR cloning kit (catalog no. K2400-20, Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting entry clones were used in Gateway® LR Clonase™ recombination reactions (catalog no. 11791-019, Invitrogen) with Gateway-converted pYTH9 and pYTH16 destination vectors to clone in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) for yeast two-hybrid studies as described previously (48Fuller K.J. Morse M.A. White J.H. Dowell S.J. Sims M.J. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain Y190 expressing the fusion protein between the Gal4 DBD and the IKK3 C terminus was selected and transformed with a human H9 T-cell cDNA library (GlaxoSmithKline) to give at least a 1-fold representation of the library. Interacting clones were selected with minimal selective dropout medium minus histidine, leucine, and tryptophan and containing 15 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (catalog no. A8056, Sigma), followed by production of β-galactosidase as determined by a freeze-fracture assay. Plasmid DNA was recovered from yeast using the Yeastmaker yeast plasmid isolation kit (catalog no. 630441, Clontech), and the resulting DNA was transformed into E. coli before sequencing. Mass Spectrometry—Anti-IKK3 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate endogenous IKK3 from HeLa cell extracts (25 × 108) as described below. Eluted endogenous IKK3 complexes were then run on 4–12% gels and separated by gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained overnight with Coomassie Blue. Bands were excised and then reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin using a MassPREP workstation (Waters, Manchester, UK). The resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a CapLC and Q-Tof mass spectrometer (Waters) operating in data-dependent MS/MS mode. Targeted liquid chromatography-MS/MS experiments were carried out by creating a list of expected tryptic fragments for selected proteins. Information on the predicted ions was used to direct sampling of particular peptides derived from mixtures in follow-up liquid chromatography-MS/MS analyses. Peptides and proteins were identified by automated searching of all MS/MS spectra against a GlaxoSmithKline non-redundant protein data base. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HeLa cells were seeded in 10- or 15-cm dishes and, if needed, stimulated for 24 h with 20 ng/ml TNFα at 75% confluency. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of low stringency lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Anti-IKKϵ polyclonal (catalog no. ab7891, Abcam), anti-p52 monoclonal (catalog no. 05-361, Upstate), or anti-p65 polyclonal (catalog no. sc-8008, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibody was incubated with cell lysate for 2 h and then for 1 h after addition of protein G-Sepharose. The immune complexes were precipitated, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and subsequently immunoblotted. Anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) was used for detection of expression levels in luciferase assays. In Vitro Kinase Assay—For kinase assays, immune complexes were washed an additional three times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 100 μm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immune complex kinase reactions were carried out by incubating the immunoprecipitated kinases with GST-p100, GST-p65-(1–306), or GST-p65-(428–551) and 30 μl of kinase buffer plus 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.6 μm nonradioactive ATP. Samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Overexpressed and purified GST was used as a negative control. Gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and visualized by autoradiography. Gel Filtration—HeLa cells stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNFα for 30 h and lysed in high stringency lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice for 15 min. Approximately 8 μg of protein from the whole cell extracts was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 50 mm NaHPO2–4. 3-ml fractions were collected for immunoblotting or precipitation. If not used immediately, the samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Transfection-based Reporter Gene Assays—MEFs were seeded at 0.2–0.5 × 105/ml in 24-well plates; incubated overnight; and transfected with GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a total amount of 350–400 μg/well containing 150 ng of p-55UASGLuc and 50 ng of p52-Gal4 fusion construct or of a construct bearing the Gal4 DBD only (used as a negative control). HEK293 cells were seeded at 0.5 × 105/ml in 96-well plates and transfected with a total of 250 ng of DNA containing 100 ng of p-55UASGLuc or 30 ng of p52-Gal4, Gal4-p65, or the Gal4 DBD. The assays also contained the plasmid DNA of interest, an empty vector as filler DNA, and 20–50 ng of Renilla reniformis luciferase construct (used as internal control to determine transfection efficiency). For NF-κB-luciferase and IFN-stimulated response element-luciferase assays, HEK293 cells were seeded at 1–2 × 104/well in 96-well plates; incubated overnight; and transfected with a total amount of 250 ng of DNA/well comprising 100 ng of reporter construct, the plasmid DNA of interest, 40 ng of R. reniformis luciferase construct, and empty vector as filler DNA. The cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega Ltd., Southampton, UK) for 15 min. Cell extracts were monitored 24–36 h post-transfection for firefly luciferase activity following standard protocols. Activities are expressed as -fold activation over unstimulated empty vector controls. The experiments were carried out in triplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Wild-type MEFs were grown in 15-cm dishes and treated as described in the figure legends. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (49Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Avraham A. Gerlitz O. Pashut-Lavon I. Ben-Neriah Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 10,000 cpm double-stranded [γ-32P]ATP and NF-κB binding sequence (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) in hybridization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin) containing 2 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor. Supershift antibodies specific for p65 (catalog no. sc-8008X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and NF-κB2 (clone K-27, catalog no. sc-298, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were added to the nuclear extracts and kept on ice for 1 h prior to hybridization with the oligonucleotide. Protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, and complex formation was detected by autoradiography. IKKϵ Interacts with NF-κB2—To gain insight into the function of IKKϵ and to expand our understanding of the IKKϵ signaling cascade, a yeast two-hybrid screen for IKKϵ-interacting proteins was performed. A schematic representation of the IKKϵ protein and the truncation mutant used for yeast two-hybrid screening is shown in Fig. 1A. Using the C-terminal portion of IKKϵ containing a helix-loop-helix motif (amino acids 541–716) as a bait, we screened an H9 T-cell cDNA library and identified 33 positive clones that were able to activate reporter gene expression. These included IKKϵ-interacting fusion proteins containing portions of TANK (TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator; I-TRAF (TNF receptor-associated factor)) and NF-κB2. The interaction between IKKϵ and TANK has been reported previously by Nomura et al. (50Nomura F. Kawai T. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). More recently, TANK was shown to link IKKϵ with the classical IKK complex (51Chariot A. Leonardi A. Muller J. Bonif M. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37029-37036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of human NF-κB2 (p100/p52) is shown in Fig. 1B, and highlighted in boldface is the sequence incorporated within the positive clone from the yeast two-hybrid screen. The N-terminal region of NF-κB2 contains the Rel homology region (Fig. 1C). As the association with NF-κB2 was novel, additional studies were undertaken to verify the interaction in cells and to investigate the biological relevance in more detail. Confirmation of an IKKϵ Interaction with NF-κB2 (p52)—Based on the interaction in yeast, the association of IKKϵ with NF-κB2 (p100/p52) was investigated and confirmed to occur endogenously in HeLa cells. IKKϵ was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell lysates prepared before and after stimulation with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 24 h. Gel-separated proteins were then Western-blotted with an antibody that recognizes the full-length NF-κB2 protein (p100/p52) (Fig. 2). After TNFα stimulation, an endogenous interaction could be det"
https://openalex.org/W2136831855,"Despite a simple consensus sequence, there is considerable variation of promoter strengths, transcription rates, and the kinetics of initiating nucleotide incorporation among the promoters found in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial genome. We asked how changes in the initiating (+1 and +2) nucleotides, conformation of the promoter DNA template, and mutation of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAP) affect the kinetics of nucleotide (NTP) utilization. Using a highly purified in vitro mitochondrial transcription system, we found that 1) the mtRNAP requires the highest concentrations of the +1 and +2 initiating NTPs, intermediate concentrations of NTPs at positions 5 to 11, and low concentrations of elongating NTPs; 2) the mtRNAP requires a higher concentration of the +2 NTP than the +1 NTP for initiation; 3) the kinetics of +2 NTP utilization are altered by a point mutation in the mtRNAP subunit Mtf1; and 4) a supercoiled or pre-melted promoter DNA template restores normal +2 NTP utilization by the Mtf1 mutant. Based on comparisons to the structural and biochemical properties of the bacterial RNAP and the closely related T7 RNAP, we propose that initiating nucleotides, particularly the +2 NTP, are required at high concentrations to drive mitochondrial promoter opening or to stabilize a productive open complex.

The accessory factor for the yeast mtRNAP, Mtf1, is a 43-kDa protein that interacts directly with Rpo41, creating a functional “holoenzyme” with promoter-specific activity (5Jang S.-H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22671-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the synthesis of a short RNA chain (∼12 nucleotides), Mtf1 is released, and Rpo41 continues elongation of the transcript (6Mangus D.A. Jang S.-H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been demonstrated that Rpo41 alone can initiate transcription in a promoter-specific manner in vitro in the absence of Mtf1 (7Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, this Mtf1-independent activity is only possible on supercoiled or pre-melted “bubble” promoter templates in which the promoter opening stages of transcription initiation have been facilitated or bypassed. Mtf1 alters the ratio of full-length to abortive transcripts on nonlinear templates (7Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) demonstrating that Mtf1 influences both promoter opening and clearance by the mtRNAP. Despite these findings, the mechanistic function of Mtf1 and its homologs in promoter selective transcription is still not well understood. The yeast mtRNAP mediates gene expression in the mitochondrial compartment by binding and initiating transcription at a collection of short, nonanucleotide (consensus ATATAAGTA) promoters encompassing the transcriptional start site (+1) and the eight nucleotides directly upstream. Despite the apparent similarity of promoters, transcription rates of mitochondrial genes can vary over 50-fold in vitro and up to 100-fold in vivo, which in combination with different stabilities results in up to 1000-fold variations in vivo in transcript abundance (8Mueller D.M. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11756-11764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mueller D.M. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11816-11822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of careful in vitro studies looking at the relationship between promoter sequence and mtRNAP activity have characterized the elements of mitochondrial promoters essential for recognition by the polymerase as well as the NTPs that contribute to the efficiency of transcription or promoter strength (10Biswas T.K.

Getz G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Several nucleotides within the consensus sequence are essential, but substitution is tolerated at other positions. Of note, the +1 initiating NTP can be changed with modest affects on promoter strength in vitro, but this position is conserved as an “A” in all yeast mitochondrial promoters (13Biswas T.K. Ticho B. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13690-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the –8 to +1 consensus promoter region, DNA sequences as much as 300 bp upstream, and at least 9 bp downstream of the promoter can affect observed promoter utilization by the mtRNAP. The nucleotide at the +2 position determines promoter strength (12Biswas T.K. Edwards J.C. Rabinowitz M. Getz G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Biswas T.K. Ticho B. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13690-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Biswas T.K.

Specifically, a +2 purine (A or G) results in a “strong” or highly efficient promoter, whereas promoters with a pyrimidine (C or T) in the +2 position are classified as “weak” (14Biswas T.K. Getz G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Wettstein-Edwards J. Ticho B.S. Martin N.C. Najarian D. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2905-2911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro promoter strength and transcription rate correlate well with steady-state mitochondrial RNA abundance (8Mueller D.M. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11756-11764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mueller D.M. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11816-11822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in mtRNAP activity are responsible for the regulation of mitochondrial transcript levels in vivo. Like other RNAPs, the mtRNAP requires higher levels of its initiating (+1 ATP) nucleotide than those used for elongation (10Biswas T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9338-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Biswas T.K. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19053-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Winkley C.S. Keller M.J. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14214-14223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently extended this observation to demonstrate a clear relationship between the in vitro kinetics of ATP utilization (KmATP) and the in vivo regulation of mtRNAP transcription (18Amiott E.A. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This property of the mtRNAP couples mitochondrial gene expression to mitochondrial function. However, in vivo and in vitro responses to fluctuating ATP concentration (KmATP) vary over 10-fold between promoters (18Amiott E.A. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Ulery T.L. Jang S.-H. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1160-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that factors in addition to the +1 NTP influence transcriptional activity and NTP utilization by the mtRNAP. To explore these additional factors we looked more closely at the kinetics of NTP usage by the mtRNAP when both the DNA template and the polymerase itself are altered. We found that the requirement for high concentrations of initiating NTPs was specific for an initiation step prior to or including first phosphodiester bond formation. By altering the initiating (+1 and +2) nucleotides of several promoters we observed that, as for bacterial rRNA promoters (20Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 21Lew C.M. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19481-19485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), both the +1 and +2 nucleotides were very important for promoter utilization. In fact, like T7 RNAP (22Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) we found that the NTP used for the +2 position of the transcript was needed at higher concentration than the +1 NTP. Finally, we found that a point mutation in the mtRNAP subunit Mtf1 specifically raised the Km for the +2 NTP on linear DNA templates but not on supercoiled or premelted bubble DNA. Our results suggest that an open promoter conformation can bypass one of the NTP-dependent steps of the polymerase compromised by the Mtf1 mutation. In Vitro Transcription Templates—COX2, 21 S rRNA, 14 S rRNA, tRNAGlu, ATP9, COX1, and tRNACys linear plasmid DNA templates were as described previously (18Amiott E.A. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). COX2, 14 S rRNA, and tRNACys promoter templates with substitutions at the +1 and +2 nucleotide positions were created by annealing complementary 70-bp oligonucleotides containing WT or the described sequence variations with EcoRI restriction sites on each end (Table 1). The annealed fragments were cloned into the pRS2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and, when linearized, generated run-off transcripts 35 nucleotides in length. Uncut plasmids served as supercoiled promoter templates, and the mismatched 14 S rRNA bubble template was prepared from 70-bp oligonucleotides as described (7Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides for constructing in vitro transcription templates with altered +1 and +2 nucleotidesPromoter+1 +25′ to 3′ sequenceCOX2 (WT)AG(A) 5′-CCGGAATTCAAATTATAAATAAATTTTAATTAAAAGT (AG) TATTAATATATTATAAATAGATAAAAGAATTCC-3′(B) 5′-GGAAATCTTTTATCTATTTATAATATATTAATA (CT) ACTTTTAATTAAAATTTATTTATAATTTGAATTCCGG-3′(+2A)AA(+1G)GG(+1G +2A)GA14 S rRNA (WT)AA(A) 5′-CCGGAATTCATTAATAATTTATTTATTATTATATAAGT (AA) TAAATAATAGTTTTATAATAAGAATTCC-3′(B) 5′-GGAATTCTTATTATATAAAACTATTATTTA (TT) ACTTATATAATAATAAATAAATTATTAATGAATTCCGG-3′(+1G)GA(+2G)AGtRNACys (WT)AU(A) 5′-CCGGAATTCATAGAATAAAGATATAAATAATTATAAGT (AT) ATAAAGTAATAAAGGAGATGTTGAATTCC-3′(B) 5′-GGAATTCAACATCTCCTTTATTACTTTAT (AT) ACTTATAATTATTTATATCTTTATTCTATGAATTCCGG-3′(+2A)AA(+2G)AG Open table in a new tab In Vitro Transcription Reaction Conditions—Recombinant Rpo41 (pJJ1399: His-Rpo41) and WT or mutant Mtf1 (pJJ1286: GST-Mtf1/pJJ1292: GST-C192F Mtf1) proteins were expressed and purified as described (23Matsunaga M. Jang S.-H. Jaehning J.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Karlok M.A. Jang S.-H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28143-28149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Multiple round transcription reactions were performed using 20 μg/ml plasmid DNA template or 1 nmol bubble template. Transcription was initiated by the addition of 0.8 pmol of Rpo41 to a reaction containing 0.8 pmol of Mtf1, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm UTP, [α-32P]UTP (1000 cpm/pmol UTP), 250 μm ATP, GTP, and CTP (as described in figure legends) for a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 7 min, and transcription was terminated by adding 25 μl of stop/loading buffer (90% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol) on ice. Samples were denatured at 70 °C for 5 min prior to loading on 7 m urea, 8% or 10% polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis. Radiolabeled run-off transcription products were visualized on a STORM 860 phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using Quantity One analysis software (Bio-Rad). Statistical analyses, KmNTP calculations, and all graphs were prepared using PRISM® software (GraphPad™ Software, Inc.). The dinucleotide ApA (Sigma) was used at 50 μm. The mtRNAP Requires High Concentrations of Both the +1 and +2 NTPs—Using purified recombinant mtRNAP subunits and varying concentrations of a single NTP, we determined the concentration of ATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP substrate at which half-maximal enzymatic activity was achieved (Km) on several mitochondrial promoters in vitro. The run-off transcripts generated for each ATP or GTP concentration on the COX2 (+1 +2 AG) promoter template are shown in Fig. 1A. The signal from each transcript was quantified and normalized to the maximal signal within each titration (% max cpm), and the Km for each NTP was determined by nonlinear regression analysis using the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 1A, lower panel and Fig. 2). As reported previously (18Amiott E.A. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the Km for the +1 ATP for each promoter is always higher than the Km for the elongating NTP CTP (<5 μm, data not shown).FIGURE 2The Km for the +2 NTP is higher than the Km for the +1 NTP. Promoters and their average KmATP and KmGTP (KmUTP included for the +1 +2 AU tRNACys promoter) are graphed and arranged in groups by +1 +2 NTP sequence as indicated at the bottom of the figure. For KmATP and KmGTP, bars represent the average, and error bars are the standard deviation from at least triplicate experiments. For KmUTP, the bar represents the average, and the error bars represent the range of duplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the high Km values observed are in fact because of a requirement for initiation, we repeated KmATP experiments on the COX1 (+1 +2 AA) promoter template in the presence or absence of the dinucleotide ApA to eliminate the energy barrier of first bond formation and stabilize the initiation complex (10Biswas T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9338-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Biswas T.K. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19053-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that addition of ApA lowers the KmATP on the COX1 promoter nearly 10-fold from 59 to 6.5 μm, indicating that transcription initiation is much less dependent on ATP if the bond between the first two nucleotides in the RNA chain has already been formed. Therefore, the elevated ATP requirement of the mtRNAP on this promoter is specific to initiation events prior to or including bond formation between the +1 and +2 NTPs. Unexpectedly, we observed that on the COX2 promoter the Km for the +2 nucleotide, GTP (57 μm), is higher than the Km for the +1 ATP (12 μm) (Figs. 1A and 2). This suggested that the mtRNAP requires both the +1 and +2 NTPs at higher concentrations for initiation, and that the +2 NTP might be needed at higher concentrations than the +1 NTP. When we looked more closely at the sequence of each promoter, we observed that both 21 S rRNA and COX2, the only transcripts carrying a GTP in the +2 position, required more GTP than ATP (Fig. 2). These are also the mitochondrial promoters with the lowest KmATP (Fig. 2). All other promoters tested have ATP in both the +1 and +2 position except for the weak tRNACys promoter. Synthesis of this transcript requires the pyrimidine UTP at the +2 position, and although transcription from this weak promoter requires very high levels of ATP, the KmUTP (190 μm) is even greater than the KmATP (144 μm). Thus, initiation by the mtRNAP requires high concentrations of both the +1 and +2 NTP, but the +2 NTP appears to be required at the highest concentration. +1 +2 Promoter Sequence Determines NTP Concentration Dependence—To confirm that the Km of the mtRNAP for the +2 NTP is higher than that for the +1 NTP, we created and analyzed promoter templates with substitutions in the +1 and +2 positions. Mutations in the 14 S rRNA (a strong, consensus promoter), COX2 (a strong promoter that varies from the consensus), and tRNACys (a weak, non-consensus promoter) promoters were generated to create various combinations of A, G, and T at +1 and +2 as shown in Fig. 3. The KmATP and KmGTP were determined for each template as described above. For the 14 S rRNA templates we found that the KmATP for the +2 A (AA and GA, 41 and 47 μm) templates was nearly 10-fold higher than for the +2 G (AG, 6.5 μm) template (Fig. 3A). Conversely, the KmGTP was up to 10-fold higher on the +2 G (AG, 28 μm) template than the +2 A (AA and GA, 1.5 and 4 μm) promoters (Fig. 3B). Similarly, in the COX2 promoter context we observed much higher KmATP for +2 A (AA and GA, 63 and 75 μm) constructs than for +2 G (AG and GG, 5 and 26.6 μm) constructs (Fig. 3A). KmGTP was highest for the COX2 GG promoter (>500 μm, Fig. 3B). Not unexpectedly, the KmATP or KmGTP was lowest (<5 μm) when there was no ATP (GG, COX2) or GTP (AA, 14 S rRNA), respectively, required for initiation. Also consistent with this pattern, we saw that the Km for an NTP found only in the +1 position was intermediate. For example, on the 14 S rRNA template, +1 G (GA) raised the KmGTP slightly over that of an AA start (from 1.5 to 4 μm, Fig. 3B) but to a value much lower than when G was at +2 (AG, 28 μm). The same pattern was seen for ATP on the COX2 template (Fig. 3A), where the KmATP for the AG start was much higher than the very low KmATP for the GG template (27 versus 5 μm). Finally, the KmUTP of the weak tRNACys promoter (AU) was very high (190 μm, Fig. 2), but switching the +1 position from ATP to GTP resulted in a switch from a high Km for ATP (163 μm) to a high Km for GTP (98 μm) (Fig. 3). These experiments confirm and extend our observation that the mtRNAP requires higher concentrations of both the +1 and +2 NTPs than the levels needed for elongating positions, with the +2 position needing the highest NTP concentration. Intermediate NTP Concentrations Are Required Prior to Promoter Escape—In Fig. 2 it is apparent that even within the group of promoters that initiate with AA, there is a range of KmGTP. The range is from <5 μm to over 20 μm, similar to that seen for the elongating NTP CTP. Examination of the DNA sequence downstream of the promoters revealed that the higher KmGTPs corresponded to the presence of a G in the transcript shortly after initiation. This relationship is seen more clearly in Fig. 4 where we have plotted average KmGTP relative to the position of the first GTP in the transcript. When the first GTP occurs between 5 and 11 nucleotides of the transcript, the KmGTP is elevated relative to the <5 μm values observed for G at +12 or further. We note that Mtf1 release and the transition of the mtRNAP to an elongating form occurs within this same region (6Mangus D.A. Jang S.-H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This supports the idea that the requirement of the polymerase for NTPs changes as it takes on different conformations, with the most dramatic transition occurring between initiation and elongation as Mtf1 is released. A Mutation in the mtRNAP Subunit Mtf1 Results in a Selective Increase in Km for the +2 NTP, Which Can be Suppressed by Pre-opening the Promoter—Because the association between the mitochondrial accessory factor, Mtf1, and the core polymerase, Rpo41, has been compared with interactions with factors that regulate NTP affinity of other RNAPs (5Jang S.-H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22671-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we asked how Mtf1 might modulate the kinetics of NTP utilization or Km of the core mtRNAP. We have previously reported the effects of an Mtf1 point mutation (C192F) on in vitro transcription efficiency (24Karlok M.A. Jang S.-H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28143-28149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and in vivo mitochondrial transcriptional regulation of the ATP9 transcript (18Amiott E.A. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To extend these findings and determine the effects of the C192F mutation on +2 NTP utilization, we performed in vitro transcription reactions to determine KmNTPs on other promoter templates using purified recombinant WT and C192F mutant Mtf1. As reported for the ATP9 (AA) promoter template (18Amiott E.A. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the mutant Mtf1 dramatically raised the KmATP of the 14 S rRNA (AA) promoter (from 29 to 349 μm, Fig. 5A). However, the mutant Mtf1 had essentially no effect on the KmATP of the COX2 (AG) promoter (16 versus 20 μm, Fig. 5B). To test for the effect of the C192F mutation on the +2 NTP, we measured the KmGTP for the COX2 (AG) promoter. We observed that the C192F mutant raised the Km for the +2 GTP over 10-fold from 54 to 677 μm (Fig. 5C) similar to the over 10-fold change in KmATP observed on the 14 S rRNA (AA) promoter (Fig. 5A). Therefore, the C192F point mutation has the general effect of lowering the polymerase affinity for, or the ability to utilize, the +2 NTP of a transcript. The observation that Mtf1 is required for transcription in vitro, but only on linear DNA templates, suggests that one of the functions of Mtf1 is to assist the polymerase in the promoter-opening step of initiation (7Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because initiating (+1 +2) NTP concentration appears to regulate other RNAPs by affecting the formation and/or stability of the open promoter complex (20Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 22Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 8602-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we asked whether the NTP requirement of the mtRNAP might be altered on “open” or pre-melted promoter templates. Supercoiled templates facilitate promoter melting, and partially single-stranded or bubble templates with mismatched bases in the non-template strand can be used to mimic a melted or open promoter conformation (26deHaseth P.L. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We used both supercoiled (Fig. 5D) and bubble (Fig. 5E) 14 S rRNA templates to measure in vitro KmATP with both WT and the mutant C192F Mtf1. We found that when mtRNAP-dependent promoter melting was reduced (supercoiled template) or eliminated (bubble template), the KmATP in reactions containing WT Mtf1 was relatively unaffected (KmATP of 29, 25, and 46 μm on linear, supercoiled, and bubble 14 S rRNA templates, respectively). However, with the C192F mutant Mtf1, the high KmATP seen on the linear template (KmATP of ∼350 μm, Fig. 5A) was reduced on the supercoiled (Fig. 5D) and bubble (Fig. 5E) templates nearly 10-fold to values near that for WT Mtf1 on a linear or supercoiled template (33–37 versus 25–29 μm). Therefore, the C192F mutation appears to impair +2 NTP utilization during promoter opening, which can be suppressed by providing a partially or fully open promoter. This work demonstrates that the mtRNAP requires high concentrations of the first two NTPs, in particular the +2 NTP, used to initiate RNA synthesis. A similar requirement for high levels of initiating NTPs is shared by other RNAPs including the closely related single polypeptide T7 RNAP (22Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The necessity for high levels of these initiating nucleotides serves as the basis for simple but powerful regulation of these enzymes by changing nucleotide pools and the association with accessory factors that modulate the affinity of the RNAPs for NTPs. The bacteriophage T7 RNAP has a strong preference for initiating with GTP (27Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 29Kuzmine I. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Jia Y. Patel S.S. J. Biol.

Patel and colleagues have presented a model whereby binding of the +2 NTP in the active site of the polymerase drives the ternary complex into a fully open state; a transition not seen upon binding of just the +1 NTP (22Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). They also hypothesize that this open conformation facilitates entry and positioning of the +1 NTP in the active site to create a productive initiation complex. Hence, the efficiency of transcription initiation by T7 RNAP relies on the affinity of the pre-initiation complex for the +2 NTP, which then influences +1 NTP incorporation. Based on the strong similarity of the mtRNAP to the T7 RNAP and our finding that the +2 NTP is required at higher levels than the +1 NTP, we think it very likely that a similar mechanism for initiation pertains for the mtRNAP. Both the +1 and +2 nucleotides of bacterial rRNA promoters are also required at high concentrations to stabilize the initiation complex (35Schneider D.A. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and possibly drive the isomerization of the polymerase into an initiation-competent conformation (21Lew C.M. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19481-19485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36Lew C.M. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12660-12666Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These initiation-specific NTP requirements are responsible for changes in ribosomal RNA transcriptional patterns that are sensitive to fluctuations in intracellular ATP and GTP concentrations (35Schneider D.A. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sensitivity of the bacterial RNAP is modulated by the recently discovered DksA protein, which binds the polymerase and, like T7 lysozyme, reduces the stability of promoter-polymerase complexes and raises the NTP requirement for transcription of the rrnB promoters (37Paul B.J. Barker M.M. Ross W. Schneider D.A. Webb C. Foster J.W. Gourse R.L. Cell. 2004; 118: 311-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Our discovery that a mutation in the mtRNAP accessory factor Mtf1 affects the affinity for the +2 NTP is interesting because the association of this factor with the core RNAP has been compared with both T7 lysozyme-T7 RNAP (7Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and sigma factor-RNAP (5Jang S.-H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22671-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) interactions. In the absence of structural information about the mtRNAP in combination with its accessory factor, it is difficult to speculate about how Mtf1 might modulate nucleotide binding by Rpo41. The fact that the crystal structure of Mtf1 resembles neither sigma factor nor T7 lysozyme, but instead is most like the family of RNA methyltransferases (38Schubot F.D. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) does not facilitate this speculation. However, the knowledge that Mtf1 interacts with Rpo41 in regions shared with T7 RNAP that include residues important for interactions with the open promoter (39Cliften P.F. Park J.Y. Davis B.P. Jang S.-H. Jaehning J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2897-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicates that Mtf1 interaction may modify Rpo41 structure to help stabilize the open promoter. Clearly both high concentrations of the +1 and +2 nucleotides as well as Mtf1 play an important role in the formation and/or stabilization of this critical intermediate in initiation. Our elucidation of the importance of the +2 NTP for initiation also offers an explanation for why promoters with pyrimidines in the +2 position are functional but weak (14Biswas T.K. Getz G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on the model proposed for the T7 RNAP in which the +2 NTP enters the active site first and promotes +1 NTP binding (22Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), if there is a very low affinity between the polymerase and a +2 pyrimidine, this would, by default, raise the Km for the +1 ATP resulting in a very weak promoter. This view is consistent with the very high KmATP and even higher KmUTP we observed for the weak tRNACys promoter (+1 +2 AU). In addition to the high concentrations of the +1 and +2 NTPs required for initiation, we also observed that nucleotides from +5 to +11 are needed at levels higher than those required for elongation. This may reflect a requirement for additional stabilization of the RNAP·DNA·RNA complex prior to release of Mtf1 and entry of the core RNAP into processive elongation. Conservation of ATP at the +1 position of yeast mitochondrial promoters suggests that either the mtRNAP has an intrinsic preference for initiating with ATP or that retaining ATP as the +1 nucleotide is important for regulation. Because the closely related T7 RNAP initiates with GTP (27Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Nierman W.C. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1819-1823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because the mtRNAP can initiate with other NTPs (13Biswas T.K. Ticho B. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13690-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the first possibility seems less likely. Regulation of the mtRNAP by ATP levels in vivo (18Amiott E.A. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) has probably created selective pressure to retain A in both the +1 and +2 positions of most mitochondrial promoters. An A at +1 and +2 creates promoters exquisitely sensitive to changing ATP pools within the mitochondrion. Promoters with nucleotides other than A at the +2 position require lower levels of ATP for maximal initiation, and the levels of their transcripts change less dramatically in response to changes in respiration (18Amiott E.A. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore these deceptively simple changes in the +2 position of the promoter actually have significant consequences for patterns of gene regulation. It will be interesting to determine whether other mitochondrial genomes also demonstrate such sophistication in the organization and information content of their relatively small promoters. We thank Sei-Heon Jang, Michio Matsunaga, and Mark Karlok for strains, mutants, purification protocols, and help with expression and isolation of the mtRNAP, and Christopher Korch and the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center (UCDHSC), Cancer Center Sequencing Core for sequencing the promoter constructs.

https://openalex.org/W1979810396,"Signals induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the major cytokine involved in neutrophil development, are tightly controlled by ligand-induced receptor internalization. Truncated G-CSF receptors (G-CSF-Rs) that fail to internalize show sustained proliferation and defective differentiation signaling. Steady-state forward routing also determines cell surface levels of cytokine receptors, but mechanisms controlling this are poorly understood. Here, we show that WD40 and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) box protein-2 (Wsb-2), an SOCS box-containing WD40 protein with currently unknown function, binds to the COOH-terminal region of G-CSF-R. Removal of this region did not affect internalization, yet resulted in increased membrane expression of G-CSF-R and enhanced proliferation signaling at the expense of differentiation induction. Conversely, Wsb-2 binding to the G-CSF-R reduced its cell surface expression and inhibited proliferation signaling. These effects depended on the SOCS box involved in ubiquitylation and on cytosolic lysines of G-CSF-R and imply a major role for ubiquitylation through the G-CSF-R C-terminus in forward routing of the receptor. Importantly, the Wsb-2 gene is commonly disrupted by virus integrations in mouse leukemia. We conclude that control of forward routing of G-CSF-R is essential for a balanced response of myeloid progenitors to G-CSF and suggest that disturbance of this balance may contribute to myeloid leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2074371416,"We previously reported the identification of HRPAP20 (hormone-regulated proliferation-associated protein 20), a novel hormone-regulated, proliferation-associated protein. In tumor cell lines, constitutive HRPAP20 expression enhanced proliferation and suppressed apoptosis, characteristics frequently associated with malignant progression. Here, we report that highly invasive breast cancer cell lines and human breast tumor specimens express elevated HRPAP20, which in transfection experiments in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, increased invasion. Results from mechanistic studies revealed that HRPAP20 bound to calmodulin (CaM) via a conserved CaM-binding motif. Transfection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with HRPAP20 harboring a mutated CaM-binding motif (HRPAP20K73A) inhibited its interaction with CaM and failed to increase invasion. Other experiments revealed that transfection with HRPAP20, but not HRPAP20K73A, increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Moreover, knockdown of HRPAP20 with small interfering RNA in MCF-7/HRPAP20 transfectants and wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells reduced invasion and inhibited secretion of MMP-9. Together these observations suggest that HRPAP20 may be an important regulator of breast tumor cell invasion by a CaM-mediated mechanism that leads to increased MMP-9 secretion. We conclude that dysregulation of HRPAP20 expression in tumor cells may contribute to the observed phenotypic changes associated with breast cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2143453595,"Spore formation is an extreme response of many bacterial species to starvation. In the case of pathogenic species of Bacillus and Clostridium, it is also a component of disease transmission. Entry into the pathway of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis and its relatives is controlled by an expanded two-component system in which starvation signals lead to the activation of sensor kinases and phosphorylation of the master sporulation response regulator Spo0A. Accumulation of threshold concentrations of Spo0A∼P heralds the commitment to sporulation. Countering the activities of the sensor kinases are phosphatases such as Spo0E, which dephosphorylate Spo0A∼P and inhibit sporulation. Spo0E-like protein-aspartic acid-phosphate phosphatases, consisting of 50-90 residues, are conserved in sporeforming bacteria and unrelated in sequence to proteins of known structure. Here we determined the structures of the Spo0A∼P phosphatases BA1655 and BA5174 from Bacillus anthracis using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Each is composed of two anti-parallel α-helices flanked by flexible regions at the termini. The signature SQELD motif (SRDLD in BA1655) is situated in the middle of helix α2 with its polar residues projecting outward. BA5174 is a monomer, whereas BA1655 is a dimer. The four-helix bundle structure in the dimer is reminiscent of the phosphotransferase Spo0B and the chemotaxis phosphatase CheZ, although in contrast to these systems, the subunits in BA1655 are in head-to-tail rather than head-to-head apposition. The implications of the structures for interactions between the phosphatases and their substrate Spo0A∼P are discussed. Spore formation is an extreme response of many bacterial species to starvation.

The implications of the structures for interactions between the phosphatases and their substrate Spo0A∼P are discussed. Spore formation is an extreme developmental response of many Gram-positive species of bacteria, exemplified by Bacillus subtilis, to nutrient deprivation (1Piggot P.J. Coote J.G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 908-962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It starts with an asymmetric septation, which produces a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore. The mother cell engulfs the forespore and nurtures it during its development into a resistant spore. The spore is released in the final stages upon lysis of the mother cell and can remain dormant in the soil until favorable conditions for growth are restored and it can germinate. Spores are important in the life cycle of a number of human pathogens most notably in the food-borne agents Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus cereus and the anthrax agent Bacillus anthracis (2Piggot P.J. Hilbert D.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Sporulation is energetically expensive, requiring the activation of hundreds of hitherto silent genes at a time when nutrients are scarce. As a result, it is under elaborate control. At the heart of the regulatory system is an expanded two-component signal transduction system, termed the phosphorelay (3Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The phosphorelay consists of multiple sensor kinases (4Jiang M. Shao W. Perego M. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi K. Shoji K. Shimizu T. Nakano K. Sato T. Kobayashi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that, when activated by appropriate environmental, metabolic, and cell cycle stimuli, autophosphorylate on a conserved histidine residue. The phosphoryl group is then relayed via an aspartate on Spo0F and a histidine on Spo0B to an aspartate on Spo0A. Spo0A is a response regulator and the master control element in the initiation of sporulation. If a threshold concentration of Spo0A∼P is achieved, the cell is committed to the sporulation pathway. Attainment of this threshold requires elevated levels of spo0A expression as well as increased flux of phosphoryl groups through the phosphorelay. The latter requires not only elevated activity of the sporulation sensor kinases that feed the phosphorelay but also the inactivity of a number of protein-aspartic acid phosphatases that drain it (7Perego M. Hanstein C. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 9Perego M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Spo0F and the receiver domain of Spo0A have similar tertiary structures (10Lewis R.J. Brannigan J.A. Muchova K. Barak I. Wilkinson A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 11Madhusudan Zapf J. Whiteley J.M. Hoch J.A. Xuong N.H. Varughese K.I. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 679-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Each is capable of reversible phosphotransfer to Spo0B implying a similar phosphorylation site stereochemistry. Despite these similarities, the phosphatases that dephosphorylate Spo0F∼P and Spo0A∼P are quite different. The Rap phosphatases, RapA, RapB, and RapE, which are active against Spo0F∼P, have molecular masses of ∼45 kDa and contain six tetratricopeptide repeats (12Perego M. Brannigan J.A. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Their activities are regulated by peptides derived from downstream Phr proteins following an export-import maturation process (13Perego M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8612-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast Spo0E, YisI, and YnzD, which dephosphorylate Spo0A∼P, are small 50-90-residue proteins, and little is known about their regulation (9Perego M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Structural studies of the components of the phosphorelay have provided important insights of wider significance including (i) the first glimpse of phosphorylated aspartic acid in a protein and the associated stereochemistry that is conserved across the response regulator family (10Lewis R.J. Brannigan J.A. Muchova K. Barak I. Wilkinson A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and (ii) the first view of a complex between a response regulator and a sensor kinasetype phosphotransferase domain, placing studies of the evolution of protein recognition in two-component systems on a firm footing (14Zapf J. Sen U. Madhusudan Hoch J.A. Varughese K.I. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To complement and extend these studies, structures of the kinases and phosphatases that feed and drain the sporulation phosphorelay are needed. We have attempted, without success, to crystallize the Spo0E, YisI, and YnzD proteins from B. subtilis. We therefore extended our study to putative Spo0A∼P phosphatases from B. anthracis. In this organism, the major components of the sporulation phosphorelay, Spo0F, Spo0B, and Spo0A, are essentially identical (15Stephenson K. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), although they may be phosphorylated by as many as nine sensor histidine kinases (16Brunsing R.L. La Clair C. Tang S. Chiang C. Hancock L.E. Perego M. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6972-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two putative Spo0E-type proteins, BA1655 and BA5174, were purified and shown to have Spo0A-phosphate phosphatase activity. With crystals continuing to prove elusive, we used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the structures of both proteins. The structures provide insights into the Spo0E-dependent dephosphorylation of Spo0A, the master regulator of sporulation. Cloning and Expression—DNA fragments encoding BA1655 and BA5174 were amplified by PCR from B. anthracis UM23CL-2 genomic DNA. Sequence alignment data showed that the annotated sequences provided by The Institute for Genomic Research (Rockville, MD) for the loci BA5174 and BA1655 may possess 51 and 18 extra residues, respectively, at their N termini compared with B. subtilis Spo0E. The coding sequences for these “extra” amino acid residues were omitted from the final constructs used in this work. The amplified fragments were digested with the restriction endonucleases NcoI and XhoI and ligated to similarly cut pET-28a vector DNA (Novagen). The ligation products were introduced into Escherichia coli NovaBlue competent cells (Novagen). Restriction enzyme digestion analysis of recombinant plasmids and subsequent DNA sequencing allowed the isolation of desired recombinants in which the coding sequences of the phosphatases are placed adjacent to a sequence encoding a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (LEHHHHHH). Protein Production—Protein expression and purification, as well as sample preparation, were performed as described previously (17Folkers G.E. van Buuren B.N.M. Kaptein R. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For production of 15N-labeled protein, recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of minimal medium (18Jansson M. Li Y.C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione B.T. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) containing 4 g/liter glucose and 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl. At an OD600 of 0.5, protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the culture was incubated with shaking at 30 °C for a further 4 h. 13C/15N doubly labeled protein was prepared in the same way with [13C]glucose at 2 g/liter replacing the unlabeled glucose in the minimal medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl) containing 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml lysozyme, and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science) and frozen at -80 °C overnight. Following cell lysis by sonication, the soluble cell fraction was fractionated by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography using a Poros MC column and a BioCad Vision HPLC 5The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; r.m.s., root mean square; N-Spo0A, the receiver domain of Spo0A; BA, B. anthracis; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; GAP, GTPase-activating protein. system (Applied Biosystems). Samples were loaded in Buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole, and after washing, bound proteins were eluted in Buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole and directed onto a Sephadex G75 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. Protein fractions eluting from this column were buffer-exchanged into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 150 mm NaCl in the case of BA5174 and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl in the case of BA1655. The protein samples were concentrated initially to 0.3-1.0 mm, and sodium azide and D2O were added to the samples to final concentrations of 0.02 and 10%, respectively. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR measurements on U-15N- and U-13C,15N-labeled BA1655 and BA5174 were recorded on Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at 700 and 900 MHz. For the intrinsically dimeric BA1655, the temperature was set to 298 K, whereas a lower temperature of 278 K was chosen for BA5174 to obtain a homogeneous monomeric spectrum (see below). The three-dimensional spectra required for resonance assignment and structure determination were recorded using a standard set of NMR experiments (19Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). To accelerate resolution sampling in the indirect 15N dimension, extensive spectral folding was applied resulting in sweep widths of 13.8 ppm for BA5174 and 7.0 ppm for BA1655. For resonance assignment of both proteins, we recorded slightly different sets of NMR spectra to account for the substantially lower inherent sensitivity of the BA5174 sample (∼0.3 mm concentration at 278 K) compared with the BA1655 sample (∼1mm dimer concentration at 298 K). Thus, for both samples we recorded sequential CO and CA information for backbone assignment in three-dimensional inter-residual (i - 1) HNCO and CBCA[CO]NH and bifurcate (i, i - 1) HN[CA]CO and HNCA experiments as well as side chain information in three-dimensional [H]CCH correlated spectroscopy, H[C]CH total correlated spectroscopy, and [H]C[CCO]NH total correlated spectroscopy experiments. The optional, more sensitivity-limited three-dimensional (i, i - 1) HNCACB (to obtain sequential CB information) and H[CCO]NH total correlated spectroscopy experiments for backbone and side chain assignment, respectively, were only recorded for BA1655. For BA5174, we recorded instead three-dimensional (i - 1) HBHA[CO]NH and (i, i - 1) HN[CA]HA spectra to add sequential HA information to the backbone assignment protocol; we furthermore recorded a two-dimensional H,H total correlated spectroscopy experiment with H[15N] suppression in the direct dimension (20Whitehead B.

All spectra were processed in XWinNMR 3.5 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany), and peak lists were generated by SPARKY (21Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2006Google Scholar). Sequential backbone assignment was performed largely automatically using both PASTA (22Leutner M. Gschwind R.M. Lermann J. Schwarz C. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. J. Biol. NMR. 1998; 11: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and AutoAssign (23Zimmerman D.E. Kulikowski C.A. Huang Y. Feng W. Tashiro M. Shimotakahara S. Chien C. Powers R. Montelione G.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 592-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), whereas manual side chain assignment was supported by in-house software. For structure elucidation we recorded a set of three-dimensional H,NH-, H,CH-, and [H]C,NH-NOE spectroscopy spectra (24Diercks T. Coles M. Kessler H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 15: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) complemented by a high-resolution two-dimensional H,H-NOE spectroscopy spectrum. Automated NOE assignment and structure calculations were performed using the CANDID (25Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar), although NOE spectra were manually checked for i + 3 and i + 4 peaks to identify helical boundaries. Dihedral angle restraints were calculated using TALOS (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Finally, water refinement was performed using CNS (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

Molecular Weight Determination—Proteins were analyzed by gel filtration on a Superdex S75 column (3.2 × 30 cm) equilibrated and run using an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL/I analytical ultracentrifuge using Beckman cells with 12-mm path length double sector six-channel charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces and quartz windows in an AN-50Ti rotor. BA1655 (165 μg/ml) was prepared in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaCl, whereas BA5174 (86 μg/ml) was prepared in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. Serial 2-fold dilutions of the protein were prepared, and 118 μl samples were centrifuged along with buffer samples as references at 25,000 rpm for 17 h and at 35,000 rpm for a further 18 h at 20 °C. The temperature was lowered to 8 °C, and runs at 35,000 rpm for 15 h and 25, 000 rpm for 21 h were performed. Radial absorbance scans were taken at 280 or 230 nm at ∼3-h intervals until sedimentation equilibrium was achieved as judged by the absence of change in overlays of successive scans. The data were analyzed using the Beckman Origin software (supplied with the machine). A narrow range of data points around a series of radial points in the scan were used to estimate midpoint molecular weights using the Lamm equation for a single species. These were then plotted against concentration. The data were also analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting to each set of data assuming a single species model (Beckman Origin software). Protein concentrations were estimated as follows. For BA5174, the protein concentration was determined from plots of A280 versus A230 from scans taken at equilibrium at 35,000 rpm. These gave linear plots that indicated that A280 = 0.109 × A230. Thus, using the calculated A280 for 1 mg/ml protein = 0.563, 1 A230 (in a 1.2-cm path length cell) corresponds to 0.162 mg/ml (20 μm). For BA1655, which lacks Trp and Tyr residues and has a negligible extinction coefficient, the concentration was estimated from interference optical data assuming BA1655 gives a normal response. 1 A230 corresponds to 0.35 mg/ml protein. In Vivo Assays—The BA1655 locus was cloned as a 380-bp fragment obtained by PCR amplification using the oligonucleotide primers BA1655-5′Eco (GAGCCGAATTCTTTTGTAATTAGACACACGC) and BA1655-3′BamII (TAAAAGGATCCAAATTCTTATTTATGTAC). This fragment included 207 bp upstream of the codon for the first methionine residue shown in Fig. 1. The fragment was cloned in the multicopy vector pHT315 (33Arantes O. Lereclus D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). After propagation in the dam- E. coli strain C600, the resulting plasmid, pHT315-1655, was used to transform the B. anthracis Sterne strain 34F2 by the method of Koehler et al. (34Koehler T.M. Dai Z. Kaufman-Yarbray M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 586-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotype of the transformants was analyzed on Schaeffer's sporulation agar plates (sporulation medium) (35Schaeffer P. Millet J. Aubert J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Transcription analysis was carried out by means of β-galactosidase assays on a B. anthracis 34F2 strain carrying a transcriptional lacZ fusion construct generated on plasmid pTCVlac (36Poyart C. Trieu-Cuot P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 156: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The 285-bp fragment containing the promoter region was generated by PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primers BA1655-5′Eco (see above) and BA1655-3′BamI (TATCAGGATCCAATCCATGTCTAGC). Strains were grown in liquid sporulation medium supplemented with 7.5 μg/ml kanamycin. Aliquots were taken at hourly intervals, and β-galactosidase activity was assayed as described previously (37Ferrari E. Howard S.M. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 173-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The incubation at 37 °C with lysozyme was carried out for 1 h and Triton was used at 0.5% final concentration. Activity Assays—The phosphorylated form of the receiver domain of Spo0A from Bacillus stearothermophilus, prepared as described previously (38Muchová K. Lewis R.J. Perečko D. Brannigan J.A. Ladds J.C. Leech A. Wilkinson A.J. Barák I. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was generously provided by Dr. Rick Lewis, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Its dephosphorylation by BA1655 and BA5174 was monitored using a gel electrophoresis assay exploiting the observation that dephosphorylation of N-Spo0A∼P is associated with an increase in gel mobility (39Zapf J.W. Hoch J.A. Whiteley J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2926-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Lewis R.J. Scott D.J. Brannigan J.A. Ladds J.C. Cervin M.A. Spiegelman G.B. Hoggett J.G. Barák I. Wilkinson A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, N-Spo0A∼P at a concentration of ∼30 μm was incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions (3.6 μm to 60 nm) of BA1655 and BA5174. After 1 h at room temperature, a half-volume of sample buffer (1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was added, and the samples were immediately loaded on a 12.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis at 150 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C, the proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The Distribution of Spo0E-like Phosphatases—The spo0E gene of B. subtilis was discovered following the characterization of strains in which sporulation was arrested at stage 0. The mutant phenotype was found to be due to Spo0E hyperactivity (8Ohlsen K.L. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1756-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Perego M. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2514-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of the genome sequence of this organism led to the identification and characterization of two homologous proteins, YnzD and YisI, which dephosphorylate Spo0A∼P and whose overexpression lowers the sporulation frequency (9Perego M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Analysis of the genome sequences of Bacillus species in the Cereus group (B. anthracis, B. cereus, and Bacillus thuringiensis) suggests that there has been an expansion in the number of open reading frames that encode small protein-aspartate phosphatases. In B. anthracis, there appear to be five proteins with sequences resembling the Spo0E, YnzD, and YisI proteins of B. subtilis, although two in the Ames strain may not be functional due to frameshifts (supplemental Table S1). B. cereus also appears to have five spo0E-like genes, and B. thuringiensis may have six (supplemental Table S1). Large plasmids contained in B. cereus and B. thuringiensis also harbor homologous genes. A sequence alignment (Fig. 1) highlights the canonical “signature” sequence, SQELDXL (9Perego M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The first, fifth, and seventh residues are invariant with limited Gln → Arg, Glu → Gln/Asp, and Leu → Ile variations at the second, third, and fourth positions, respectively. These variations become more marked in the homologous proteins of a wider set of Gram-positive organisms that contain Spo0A-like substrate proteins, particularly those that live in extreme environments (supplemental Fig. S1). BA1655 and BA5174 Dephosphorylate Spo0A in Vivo and in Vitro—To characterize further the Spo0E family of aspartic acid-phosphate phosphatases, we expressed and purified a number of Spo0E-like proteins from different Bacillus species. The B. anthracis proteins BA5174 and BA1655 were chosen for extended study because (i) both proteins could be overproduced in good yield and at high solubility from E. coli, and (ii) they are representative of Spo0E-like proteins that harbor the signature sequence SQELDXL (BA5174) and those that contain the most common variation on this motif, SRDLDXL (BA1655). To determine whether these proteins play a role in regulating the sporulation phosphorelay, the genes encoding the BA1655 and BA5174 proteins were cloned on the multicopy vector pHT315 and transformed in the parental B. anthracis strain 34F2. Overexpression of Spo0E-like proteins results in a sporulation-deficient phenotype (Spo-) due to their dephosphorylating activity on Spo0A∼P (9Perego M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The B. anthracis strain carrying pHT315-1655 clearly showed a Spo- phenotype when grown on Schaeffer's sporulation medium compared with the strain carrying the vector alone (Fig. 2A). This result indicated that BA1655 is indeed a negative regulator of sporulation. Transcription analysis by means of β-galactosidase assays on a strain carrying a promoter lacZ fusion construct showed that a 207-bp fragment upstream of the coding sequence is sufficient to promote a relatively high level of expression that appeared to be essentially constitutive throughout the growth cycle (Fig. 2B). Similar in vivo analyses of BA5174 indicated that this gene is not transcribed at sufficiently high levels to result in overproduction of its gene product, thus explaining the lack of a sporulation phenotype when cloned on pHT315. 6C. Bongiorni and M. Perego, manuscript in preparation. Purified BA1655 and BA5174 were each able to promote the dephosphorylation in vitro of the phosphorylated form of the receiver domain of Spo0A (N-Spo0A) from B. stearothermophilus. Phosphorylated N-Spo0A has a lower electrophoretic mobility than the unphosphorylated protein in non-denaturing gels (40Lewis R.J. Scott D.J. Brannigan J.A. Ladds J.C. Cervin M.A. Spiegelman G.B. Hoggett J.G. Barák I. Wilkinson A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, incubation of N-Spo0A∼P with either BA1655 or BA5174 led to an increase in mobility, confirming the capacity of both proteins to dephosphorylate N-Spo0A∼P. BA5174 exhibited ∼8-fold higher specific activity than BA1655 in these assays, an observation we made with two different protein preparations. To gain insights into the mechanism and substrate specificity of these small aspartic acid phosphatases, we determined the structures of these two representative members. NMR Data and Structure Determination—As a step toward structure determination, we expressed and purified a number of Spo0E-like proteins from different Bacillus species in an unsuccessful quest for crystals. In the absence of crystals, we turned to NMR spectroscopy. The initial 15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra for both BA1655 and BA5174 showed limited HN dispersion (∼7.1-8.8 ppm), characteristic of all α-helical proteins (supplemental Fig. S2). The BA5174 heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra, however, revealed remarkable temperature dependence (data not shown) with a second set of signals appearing above 283 K and predominating at higher temperatures (>308 K). The disappearance of this second set of signals, with distinctly larger line widths, upon 10-fold dilution (to ∼50 μm) at 298 K suggested reversible, yet stable multimerization. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that under these conditions aggregation accompanied by partial unfolding is occurring given the appearance of amide resonances around the random coil position together with the decrease in signal intensity for the monomeric species. We therefore chose to simplify the NMR investigations by carrying out experiments at the relatively low protein concentration of ∼0.3 mm and at the lower temperature of 278 K at which a single species was prevalent. Even under these conditions, several heteronuclear single quantum correlation peaks from BA5174 either had shoulders or could be resolved into weak nearby second peaks, indicating the persistence of some conformational heterogeneity. Complete sets of NMR spectra for assignment and structure elucidation were recorded in 15 and 22 days for BA1655 and BA5174, respectively, on spectrometers operati"
