This is in part because the mesoporous TiO 2 used as an electron-transporting layer can photocatalyze unwanted reactions in the perovskite layer. Shin et al. report a low-temperature colloidal method for depositing La-doped BaSnO 3 films as a replacement for TiO 2 to reduce such ultraviolet-induced damage. Solar cells retained over 90% of their initial performance after 1000 hours of full sun illumination. Science , this issue p. 167"

Bardina et al. tested whether DENV and WNV antibodies from humans, or even yellow fever vaccination, could enhance ZIKV infection. In a mouse model, low titers of DENV and WNV antibodies enhanced ZIKV viremia, especially in the spinal cord and testes, whereas high titers remained protective. Generally, WNV antibodies were less disease-enhancing than DENV antibodies, and, in macaques, yellow fever vaccination had very little effect. Science , this issue p. 175"

https://openalex.org/W2597733230,"Intracellular lysosomal membrane trafficking, including fusion and fission, is crucial for cellular homeostasis and normal cell function. Both fusion and fission of lysosomal membrane are accompanied by lysosomal Ca2+ release. We recently have demonstrated that the lysosomal Ca2+ release channel P2X4 regulates lysosome fusion through a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent mechanism. However, the molecular mechanism underlying lysosome fission remains uncertain. In this study, we report that enlarged lysosomes/vacuoles induced by either vacuolin-1 or P2X4 activation are suppressed by up-regulating the lysosomal Ca2+ release channel transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) but not the lysosomal Na+ release channel two-pore channel 2 (TPC2). Activation of TRPML1 facilitated the recovery of enlarged lysosomes/vacuoles. Moreover, the effects of TRPML1 on lysosome/vacuole size regulation were eliminated by Ca2+ chelation, suggesting a requirement for TRPML1-mediated Ca2+ release. We further demonstrate that the prototypical Ca2+ sensor CaM is required for the regulation of lysosome/vacuole size by TRPML1, suggesting that TRPML1 may promote lysosome fission by activating CaM. Given that lysosome fission is implicated in both lysosome biogenesis and reformation, our findings suggest that TRPML1 may function as a key lysosomal Ca2+ channel controlling both lysosome biogenesis and reformation.

Interestingly, cells deficient in phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), the lysosome-specific phosphoinositide, also exhibit trafficking defects in the late endocytic pathway and enlarged lysosomes (10Cheng X.

Cell. 2004; 15: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that TRPML1 is activated by PI(3,5)P2, and the enlarged vacuolar phenotype observed in PI(3,5)P2-deficient mouse fibroblasts is rescued by TRPML1 overexpression (14Dong X.P. Shen D. Wang X. Dawson T. Li X. Zhang Q. Cheng X. Zhang Y. Weisman L.S. Delling M. Xu H. PI(3,5)P2 controls membrane trafficking by direct activation of mucolipin Ca2+ release channels in the endolysosome.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These published results suggest that TRPML1 may regulate lysosome membrane fission by transducing information regarding PI(3,5)P2 levels into changes in juxtaorganellar Ca2+ levels. To explore the mechanism of lysosome membrane fission, we have attempted to directly detect fission events using live imaging. Unfortunately, we failed to obtain convincing data to present. Alternatively, we used the recovery of enlarged lysosomes as a readout of membrane fission. We found that the enlargement of lysosomes induced by either vacuolin-1 or P2X4 activation was suppressed by up-regulating TRPML1. TRPML1 activation also facilitated the recovery of enlarged lysosomes. The effect of TRPML1 activation on lysosome recovery was eliminated by BAPTA-AM treatment, suggesting a requirement of Ca2+ release through TRPML1 for lysosome fission. We also observed that loss of TRPML1 enlarged lysosomes and suppressed enlarged lysosome recovery. Furthermore, the enlarged lysosome recovery was strongly suppressed by inhibiting the prototypical Ca2+ sensor CaM but not the other lysosomal Ca2+ sensor protein, ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene-2), suggesting that CaM acts as the Ca2+ sensor regulating lysosomal membrane fission. Our studies suggest that TRPML1 may facilitate lysosomal membrane fission through a CaM-dependent mechanism. Because cells with deficiency in either TRPML1 or PI3,5P2, the endogenous TRPML1 agonist, display enlarged lysosomes (10Cheng X. Shen D. Samie M. Xu H.

Cell. 2004; 15: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TRPML1 may control lysosome fission. To test this, we first treated Cos1 cells with vacuolin-1, a chemical that enlarges lysosomes (15Dong X.P. Cheng X. Mills E. Delling M. Wang F. Kurz T. Xu H.

The small chemical vacuolin-1 alters the morphology of lysosomes without inhibiting Ca2+-regulated exocytosis.EMBO Reports. 2005; 6: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). If TRPML1 promotes lysosome fission, we expect to see smaller lysosomes in response to vacuolin-1 in cells expressing TRPML1 or treated with the TRPML1 agonist, mucolipin synthetic agonist 1 (ML-SA1, 15 μm) (17Shen D.

Biol. 2010; 17: 135-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this study, we adopted Cos1 cell as a model to study lysosome size because this cell is one of the most commonly used mammalian cell lines possessing high transfection efficiency and good morphology for imaging. Lysosome size was analyzed by counting the percentage of cells containing at least three lysosomes larger than 4 μm in diameter as described in published work (12Cao Q. Zhong X.Z. Zou Y. Murrell-Lagnado R. Zhu M.X. Dong X.P. Calcium release through P2X4 activates calmodulin to promote endolysosomal membrane fusion.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 879-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Indeed, TRPML1-GFP or ML-SA1 significantly reduced the lysosome size induced by vacuolin-1 (1 μm for 2 h) (Fig. 1, A–C). The percentage of cells containing enlarged lysosomes induced by vacuolin-1 was decreased from 74.67 ± 5.69% in cells expressing Lamp1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1)-GFP to 50.67 ± 5.13% in cells expressing TRPML1-GFP. Consistently, ML-SA1 significantly decreased the percentage of Lamp1-GFP-expressing cells with enlarged lysosomes (induced by vacuolin-1) to 33.67 ± 10.60%. Co-application of TRPML1-GFP and ML-SA1 further decreased the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes to 7.67 ± 3.51%. These data suggest that up-regulation of TRPML1 prohibits lysosomes from enlargement. To further examine the potential role of TRPML1 in lysosome membrane fission, we enlarged lysosomes with vacuolin-1 and then evaluated the recovery of lysosome after vacuolin-1 removal. A decrease in lysosome size through time represents lysosome fission. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and E), in cells expressing Lamp1-GFP, the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes (>4 μm) was decreased from 72.67 ± 6.03 to 51.00 ± 1.03% after 1 h of recovery. This might be caused by endogenous TRPML1 activity. ML-SA1 (15 μm) treatment dramatically increased the recovery speed, and the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes was further reduced to 22.00 ± 4.31% (Fig. 2, A, E, and F). This recovery of lysosome size is Ca2+-dependent because BAPTA-AM (10 μm), a fast and membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator, remarkably inhibited the recovery (Fig. 2, B, E, and F). Recombinant TRPML1-GFP also facilitated enlarged lysosome recovery after vacuolin-1 removal, compared with that of cells expressing Lamp1-GFP. The percentage of TRPML1-GFP-expressing cells with enlarged lysosomes was reduced from 56.00 ± 4.58 to 24.67 ± 2.52% with 1 h of recovery, and ML-SA1 treatment further reduced the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes to 4.67 ± 2.52% (Fig. 2, C, E, and F). The facilitation of recovery by activation of heterologous TRPML1 was also Ca2+-dependent because BAPTA-AM pretreatment remarkably slowed down the recovery (Fig. 2, D–F). In addition, ML-SA1 promoted the recovery of enlarged lysosomes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2G). Inversely, inhibiting TRPML1 with ML-SI1 (25 μm) (21Cao Q. Zhong X.Z. Zou Y. Zhang Z. Toro L.

Cell. 2015; 33: 427-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) significantly reduced the recovery speed of enlarged lysosomes after vacuolin-1 removal (Fig. 2, H–J). Smaller vacuoles in cells with TRPML1 up-regulation could be attributed to increased fission or decreased fusion. Because fusion is Ca2+-dependent (7Pryor P.R. Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. The role of intraorganellar Ca2+ in late endosome-lysosome heterotypic fusion and in the reformation of lysosomes from hybrid organelles.J.

Calcium release through P2X4 activates calmodulin to promote endolysosomal membrane fusion.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 879-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that TRPML1-mediated Ca2+ release causes decreased fusion. Supporting this, loss of TRPML1 results in enlarged lysosomes (10Cheng X. Shen D. Samie M. Xu H.

Recently, we have shown that alkalization of lysosomes by methylamine (MA, 10 mm) increases the lysosome size by facilitating P2X4 activity (12Cao Q. Zhong X.Z. Zou Y. Murrell-Lagnado R. Zhu M.X. Dong X.P. Calcium release through P2X4 activates calmodulin to promote endolysosomal membrane fusion.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 879-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, we adopted this model to further study the role of TRPML1 in the control of lysosome size. As shown in Fig. 3A, enlarged lysosomes (>2 μm) induced by MA in P2X4-expressing cells were dramatically suppressed by TRPML1 overexpression. The percentage of P2X4-expressing cells with enlarged lysosomes (induced by MA) was decreased from 79.00 ± 2.64 to 30.00 ± 2.66% by TRPML1 co-expression. In contract, co-expression of two-pore channel 2 (TPC2), a Na+ release channel (37Wang X. Zhang X. Dong X.P. Samie M. Li X. Cheng X. Goschka A. Shen D. Zhou Y. Harlow J. Zhu M.X. Clapham D.E. Ren D.

Next, we tested whether the enlargement of lysosomes induced by activation of endogenous P2X4 could also be rescued by TRPML1 up-regulation. Lysosomes were labeled with Lamp1-GFP. MA-induced enlarged lysosomes were observed in 35.33 ± 6.81% Cos1 cells expressing Lamp1-GFP (Fig. 3C). Overexpression of TRPML1 but not TRPML1-DDKK (Fig. 3D) decreased the lysosome size induced by activation of endogenous P2X4. The percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes was decreased to 6.67 ± 3.06% by TRPML1 expression and to 7.67 ± 5.51% by ML-SA1 treatment, respectively (Fig. 3C). The pH-dependent regulation of P2X4 channel activity can be eliminated by a H286A mutation (12Cao Q. Zhong X.Z. Zou Y. Murrell-Lagnado R. Zhu M.X. Dong X.P.

Jacob W.A. Andrews N.W. Homotypic fusion between aggregated lysosomes triggered by elevated [Ca2+]i in fibroblasts.J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that Cos1 cells expressing rP2X4-H286A-GFP exhibit enlarged lysosomes in the absence of MA treatment (12Cao Q. Zhong X.Z. Zou Y. Murrell-Lagnado R. Zhu M.X. Dong X.P. Calcium release through P2X4 activates calmodulin to promote endolysosomal membrane fusion.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 879-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In agreement with the data from cells expressing P2X4, enlarged lysosomes in cells expressing rP2X4-H286A-GFP was reduced by either ML-SA1 treatment or TRPML1 expression, with a decrease in the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes from 69.67 ± 4.04 to 22.67 ± 6.81 and 19.00 ± 3.11%, respectively (Fig. 3E). In contrast, co-expression of either TPC2 or TRPML1-DDKK did not decrease the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes (data not shown). We also investigated the recovery of enlarged lysosomes induced by MA in cells overexpressing P2X4. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), the percentage of P2X4-expressing cells with enlarged lysosomes was reduced from 69.33 ± 3.79 to 41.00 ± 2.65% after 90 min of MA removal. ML-SA1 treatment remarkably increased the recovery speed, and the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes was reduced from 69.33 ± 3.79 to 7.67 ± 2.52% after 90 min of MA removal. This was reversed by BAPTA-AM, in which the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes returned to 36.33 ± 3.51% (Fig. 4, A–C). Consistently, ML-SA1 treatment reduced lysosome size in cells expressing H286A-GFP, and this was eliminated by BAPTA-AM (Fig. 4, D–F). The percentage of H286A-GFP-expressing cells with enlarged lysosomes was reduced from 69.35 ± 4.04 to 20.67 ± 3.79% by ML-SA1 treatment for 120 min, and BAPTA-AM reversed the percentage back to 55.33 ± 8.50%. By using electron microscopy, deficiency in TRPML1 has been shown to cause enlarged lysosomes (10Cheng X. Shen D. Samie M. Xu H. Mucolipins: intracellular TRPML1–3 channels.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, more spontaneously enlarged lysosomes were revealed in TRPML1-deficient (ML4) human fibroblasts than in wild-type fibroblasts under confocal microscope. Enlarged lysosomes (>2 μm) were observed in only 0.33 ± 0.58% of wild-type cells but in 16.33 ± 6.11% of ML4 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Vacuolin-1 treatment for 3 h dramatically increased the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes, with 41.33 ± 15.31% in wild-type cells but 91.33 ± 3.51% in ML4 cells (Fig. 5, A and C). Further increasing the treatment time of vacuolin-1 to 6 h caused similar percentages of cells with enlarged lysosomes in both wild-type and ML4 cells (91.00 ± 3.61% in wild-type cells and 94.00 ± 2.10% in ML4 cells, respectively; Fig. 5, A and D). This allows us to further investigate whether TRPML1 is required for the recovery of enlarged lysosomes in both wild-type and ML4 cells. Both wild-type and ML4 cells were first treated with vacuolin-1 for 6 h to induce similar sizes of enlarged lysosomes, and then the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes was compared at 6 h after vacuolin-1 removal. Notably, the percentage of cells with enlarged lysosomes after 6 h of recovery was reduced to 6.00 ± 4.58% in wild-type cells but to only 79.33 ± 7.02% in ML4 cells (Fig. 5E). Additionally, the enlarged lysosomes in ML4 cells were rescued by TRPML1 overexpression (Fig. 5, A–E). Taken together, our data suggest that TRPML1 may be required for lysosome fission.

PAEs are bonded physically, not chemically, to the polymeric matrix and can migrate to and leach from the product surface, posing a serious danger to the environment and human health. There have been a number of studies on PAE concentrations in landfill leachate conducted in the EU and around the world, though few in Poland. In the present study, the leachate of five municipal landfills was analyzed for the presence of PAEs. Raw leachate was sampled four times over the period of one year in 2015/16. It was the first large study on this subject in Poland. PAEs were detected in the leachate samples on all of the landfills, thereby indicating that PAEs are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. The following PAEs were detected in at least one sample: Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), Diethyl phthalate (DEP), Dimethyl phthalate (DMP), Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), Di-isobutylphthalate (DIBP). Out of all ten PAEs, DEHP was the most predominant, with concentrations up to 73.9 μg/L. DEHP was present in 65% of analyzed samples (in 100% of samples in spring, 80% in winter, and 40% in summer and autumn). In only 25% of all samples DEHP was below the acceptable UE limit for surface water (1.3 μg/L), while 75% was from 1.7 to 56 times higher than that value. On the two largest landfills DEHP concentrations were observed during samples from all four seasons, including on a landfill which has been remediated and closed for the last 5 years."

CXCL14 is a homeostatic chemokine with unknown receptor selectivity and preferential expression in peripheral tissues. Here, we demonstrate that CXCL14 synergized with CXCL12 in the induction of chemokine responses in primary human lymphoid cells and cell lines that express CXCR4. Combining subactive concentrations of CXCL12 with 100–300 nM CXCL14 resulted in chemotaxis responses that exceeded maximal responses that were obtained with CXCL12 alone. CXCL14 did not activate CXCR4-expressing cells (i.e., failed to trigger chemotaxis and Ca2+ mobilization, as well as signaling via ERK1/2 and the small GTPase Rac1); however, CXCL14 bound to CXCR4 with high affinity, induced redistribution of cell-surface CXCR4, and enhanced HIV-1 infection by >3-fold. We postulate that CXCL14 is a positive allosteric modulator of CXCR4 that enhances the potency of CXCR4 ligands.

Recent epidemiological studies have revealed that TFA consumption is a major risk factor for various disorders, including atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms in this disease etiology are largely unknown. Here we have shown that TFAs potentiate activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) induced by extracellular ATP, a damage-associated molecular pattern leaked from injured cells. Major food-associated TFAs such as elaidic acid (EA), linoelaidic acid, and trans-vaccenic acid, but not their corresponding cis isomers, dramatically enhanced extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis, accompanied by elevated activation of the ASK1-p38 pathway in a macrophage-like cell line, RAW264.7. Moreover, knocking out the ASK1-encoding gene abolished EA-mediated enhancement of apoptosis. We have reported previously that extracellular ATP induces apoptosis through the ASK1-p38 pathway activated by reactive oxygen species generated downstream of the P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7). However, here we show that EA did not increase ATP-induced reactive oxygen species generation but, rather, augmented the effects of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II-dependent ASK1 activation. These results demonstrate that TFAs promote extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis by targeting ASK1 and indicate novel TFA-associated pathways leading to inflammatory signal transduction and cell death that underlie the pathogenesis and progression of TFA-induced atherosclerosis.

Most TFAs are produced during the industrial food manufacturing processes, mainly through partial hydrogenation of their cis isomers, hereafter called cis-fatty acids (CFAs), present in biological sources, including vegetable and fish oils (1Gebauer S.K.

On the other hand, TFAs have been reported to have adverse effects on health; evidence from epidemiological studies has shown the association of TFA intake with systemic inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (6Estadella D. da Penha Oller do Nascimento C.M. Oyama L.M. Ribeiro E.B. Dâmaso A.R. de Piano A. Lipotoxicity: effects of dietary saturated and transfatty acids.Mediators Inflamm. 2013; 2013137579Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms of these TFA-related disorders have been explained by the biological actions of TFAs analogous to those of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) because SFAs have similar physical properties as TFAs and are well established as a risk factor for these disorders, in which the underlying mechanisms have been extensively studied (6Estadella D. da Penha Oller do Nascimento C.M.

For instance, increased intake of TFAs as well as SFAs reduces endothelial function (7Lopez-Garcia E. Schulze M.B. Meigs J.B. Manson J.E. Rifai N. Stampfer M.J. Willett W.C. Hu F.B.

Micha R. Zampelas A. Dietary fats and cardiovascular disease: putting together the pieces of a complicated puzzle.Atherosclerosis. 2014; 234: 320-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of CVDs. Nevertheless, TFAs have been known as more potent risk factors for CVDs compared with SFAs, which decrease the level of cardioprotective high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (12Mensink R.P. Zock P.L. Kester A.D. Katan M.B.

Moreover, a previous report demonstrated that TFAs, but not SFAs, decrease membrane fluidity and particularly inhibit insulin-induced antilipolytic effects and glucose transport in adipocytes (13Ibrahim A.

Thus, TFAs have specific adverse biological effects that are probably associated with a risk of TFA-related disorders. However, to date, there have been few studies of the biological effects of TFAs at the cellular or molecular level, and the underlying mechanisms of the disorders associated with TFA intake remain largely unknown. trans-fatty acid cis-fatty acid cardiovascular disease saturated fatty acid P2X purinoceptor 7 reactive oxygen species apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 elaidic acid oleic acid palmitic acid linoelaidic acid trans-vaccenic acid Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 propyl gallate N-acetylcysteine thioredoxin 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II linoleic acid cis-vaccenic acid guide RNA analysis of variance.

Atherosclerosis is regarded as an inflammatory disease because macrophages play major roles in its pathogenesis and progression; monocytes circulating in the blood are recruited to athero-prone arterial sites, differentiate into macrophages, and finally become so-called foam cells in response to oxidized lipoproteins, which contribute to plaque formation and pro-inflammatory responses in atherosclerotic lesions (17Moore K.J. Sheedy F.J. Fisher E.A. Macrophages in atherosclerosis: a dynamic balance.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Apoptotic macrophages increase in advanced atherosclerotic lesions because of insufficient clearance of apoptotic macrophages through phagocytosis by neighboring macrophages, called efferocytosis (17Moore K.J. Sheedy F.J. Fisher E.A. Macrophages in atherosclerosis: a dynamic balance.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar, 18Tabas I. Macrophage death and defective inflammation resolution in atherosclerosis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The remaining apoptotic macrophages eventually undergo necrotic cell death, called secondary necrosis, resulting in the release of proinflammatory molecules, such as damage-associated molecular patterns, from the macrophages and the amplification of proinflammatory responses, leading to the progression of atherosclerosis (17Moore K.J. Sheedy F.J. Fisher E.A. Macrophages in atherosclerosis: a dynamic balance.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar, 18Tabas I. Macrophage death and defective inflammation resolution in atherosclerosis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Extracellular ATP, one of the damage-associated molecular patterns leaked from damaged tissues or cells, is a potent inducer of macrophage apoptosis through the P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) receptor coupled with ion fluxes (19Coddou C. Yan Z. Obsil T. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Stojilkovic S.S. Activation and regulation of purinergic P2X receptor channels.Pharmacol.

The human P2X7 receptor and its role in innate immunity.Tissue Antigens. 2011; 78: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the mechanism by which the ATP-P2X7 receptor axis mediates apoptosis; ATP-induced P2X7 receptor activation causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which induces activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38 MAPK pathway, thereby leading to apoptosis (21Noguchi T. Ishii K. Fukutomi H. Naguro I. Matsuzawa A. Takeda K. Ichijo H.

Chem. 2008; 283: 7657-7665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that the P2X7 receptor is highly expressed in macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions and that knockdown of the P2X7 receptor in mice reduced plaque formation and plasma cytokine levels, suggesting the involvement of ATP-P2X7 receptor signaling in atherosclerosis progression (22Peng K. Liu L. Wei D. Lv Y. Wang G. Xiong W. Wang X. Altaf A. Wang L. He D. Wang H. Qu P. P2X7R is involved in the progression of atherosclerosis by promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Int. J. Mol. Med. 2015; 35: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is assumed that TFAs exacerbate atherosclerosis by promoting macrophage apoptosis downstream of ATP-P2X7 receptor signaling, which contributes to the onset of CVDs; however, no study has been carried out to examine this assumption. In this study, we show that elaidic acid (EA, C18.1 9T), the most abundant TFA in foods (1Gebauer S.K. Psota T.L. Kris-Etherton P.M. The diversity of health effects of individual trans fatty acid isomers.Lipids. 2007; 42: 787-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but not oleic acid (OA, C18.1 9C) as a cis isomer of EA, drastically enhanced extracellular ATP-induced cell death by causing hyperactivation of the ASK1-p38 pathway. Palmitic acid (PA, C16.0), a typical SFA in foods, also enhanced extracellular ATP-induced p38 activation and cell death but clearly to a lesser extent than EA. Other TFAs, including linoelaidic acid (LEA, C18.2, 9T12T) and trans-vaccenic acid (TVA, C18.1 11T), but not their cis isomers, also significantly enhanced extracellular ATP-induced p38 activation and cell death. These results demonstrate a novel TFA-specific biological action for inflammatory signal transduction and cell death, which explains the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis associated with TFAs. To examine whether TFAs potentiate macrophage apoptosis induced by extracellular ATP, we compared the effects of EA (the most abundant TFA in processed foods) and OA (its cis isomer) on ATP-induced cell death in a macrophage-like murine cell line, RAW264.7. First we checked the cytotoxicity of EA and OA for RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of EA and OA did not change the viability of RAW264.7 cells in the range of 0–300 μm, whereas treatment of PA, an SFA that is known to have severe cytotoxic effects, caused a significant decrease in cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that EA and OA have no cytotoxic effect on RAW264.7 cells, at least up to 300 μm. We next pretreated RAW264.7 cells with 200 μm EA or OA, stimulated them with ATP in the range of 0–1 mm, and then subjected them to a cell viability assay. Interestingly, we found that stimulation with 0.5 mm ATP severely reduced the viability of EA-pretreated cells (less than 10% cell viability) but not that of control or OA-pretreated cells (about 80–90% cell viability) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, when cells were stimulated with 0.5 mm ATP, pretreatment with EA markedly reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas OA did not at concentrations of 0–200 μm (Fig. 1C), indicating that pretreatment with EA but not OA drastically enhances ATP-induced cell death.

Lipotoxicity: effects of dietary saturated and transfatty acids.Mediators Inflamm. 2013; 2013137579Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we examined whether PA pretreatment also enhances ATP-induced cell death. As shown in Fig. 1A, 100 μm PA pretreatment alone decreased cell viability, and subsequent ATP stimulation also induced slight but significant cell death (Fig. 1D). Nevertheless, EA enhanced ATP-induced cell death to a much larger extent than PA (Fig. 1D), suggesting that EA is a more potent enhancer of ATP-induced cell death than PA. CFAs are known to have protective effects against cytotoxicity induced by SFAs (23Leamy A.K. Egnatchik R.A. Young J.D. Molecular mechanisms and the role of saturated fatty acids in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Prog. Lipid Res. 2013; 52: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the possibility that CFAs may also suppress TFA-mediated enhancement of ATP-induced cell death. PA-induced cell death was fully suppressed by co-treatment with OA, whereas treatment with OA failed to suppress ATP-induced cell death enhanced by EA (Fig. 1E), suggesting that EA enhances ATP-induced cell death through a mechanism different from that of PA-induced cell death. We have previously reported that extracellular ATP induces apoptosis through the p38 pathway activated by P2X7 receptor-mediated ROS generation (21Noguchi T. Ishii K. Fukutomi H. Naguro I. Matsuzawa A. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Requirement of reactive oxygen species-dependent activation of ASK1-p38 MAPK pathway for extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7657-7665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To investigate whether EA-mediated enhancement of cell death induced by extracellular ATP depends on the activation of p38, RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with a nonlethal dose of ATP (0.5 mm) in the presence or absence of EA, and then the phosphorylation status of p38 was monitored by immunoblotting of cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 2A, pretreatment with EA (200 μm) substantially enhanced ATP-induced p38 phosphorylation. In contrast, ATP-induced phosphorylation of other MAPKs, such as JNK and ERK, was not altered by EA pretreatment, suggesting that there is a highly specific mechanism by which EA potentiates ATP-induced p38 activation (Fig. 2A). Unlike EA, OA failed to enhance ATP-induced p38 activation (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment with PA faintly enhanced ATP-induced p38 activation compared with pretreatment with the same concentration of EA (Fig. 2C). These data show that, among the tested fatty acids, EA most potently enhanced ATP-induced activation of p38, which correlates well with the rate of extracellular ATP-induced cell death shown in Fig. 1D. We next examined whether EA enhances ATP-induced cell death through ROS-dependent activation of p38 downstream of the P2X7 receptor. As shown in Fig. 3A, the enhanced ATP-induced cell death mediated by EA was significantly suppressed by pretreatment with either the P2X7 receptor inhibitor Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (CBB), the antioxidant propyl gallate (PG), or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 but not with the JNK inhibitor SP600125, suggesting that ROS-dependent activation of p38 downstream of the P2X7 receptor is responsible for the enhancement of cell death. Moreover, immunoblot analysis showed that antioxidants such as PG and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) apparently suppressed extracellular ATP-induced p38 activation in the presence of EA (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the enhanced p38 activation by EA is dependent on ATP-induced ROS generation. To further confirm the importance of P2X7 receptor signaling on EA-mediated enhancement of ATP-induced cell death, we established P2rx7 and ASK1 KO cell lines that harbor frameshift mutations in all gene loci encoding the P2X7 receptor and ASK1, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D). In these KO cell lines, both extracellular ATP-induced phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 3E) and cell death (Fig. 3, F and G) were almost completely suppressed. Collectively, these data suggest that the enhancement of ATP-induced cell death by EA depends on the activation of the ASK1-p38 pathway and ROS generation downstream of the P2X7 receptor. To examine whether ATP-induced cell death enhanced by EA is apoptotic cell death, RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with 0.5 mm ATP with or without EA, and caspase-3 activation was assessed by immunoblotting of the cleaved (activated) form of caspase-3 in cell lysates. Stimulation of 0.5 mm ATP induced cleavage of caspase-3 only in the presence of EA (Fig. 4A, fifth through eighth lanes), which was a similar level as observed with stimulation of 1 mm ATP in the absence of EA (Fig. 4A, ninth through twelfth lanes). Only stimulation of 1 mm ATP was reported previously to induce apoptosis (21Noguchi T. Ishii K. Fukutomi H. Naguro I. Matsuzawa A. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Requirement of reactive oxygen species-dependent activation of ASK1-p38 MAPK pathway for extracellular ATP-induced apoptosis in macrophages.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7657-7665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, a DNA ladder assay demonstrated that 0.5 mm ATP treatment clearly induced apoptosis only when EA was present, as well as H2O2 treatment, which is generally known to induce apoptosis (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that EA promotes apoptosis induced by extracellular ATP. To confirm the contribution of ROS-dependent p38 activation to accelerated apoptosis, we further examined the requirement of ROS and p38 for enhancement of ATP-induced caspase-3 activation. Indeed, extracellular ATP-induced cleavage of caspase-3 was significantly suppressed either by the antioxidant PG or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 4C), supporting the notion that the enhancement of ROS-dependent p38 activation contributes to the EA-mediated increase in ATP-induced apoptosis. ASK1 is directly activated in response to ROS through the change in redox status of its binding partner thioredoxin (Trx). In unstimulated cells, reduced Trx binds to ASK1 and negatively regulates its activation. After ROS are produced, Trx is oxidized and dissociates from ASK1, inducing autophosphorylation (activation) of ASK1 (24Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mammalian thioredoxin is a direct inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK) 1.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). To examine whether EA enhances extracellular ATP-induced ASK1 activation, we assessed the phosphorylation status of ASK1 in RAW264.7 cells stimulated with 0.5 mm ATP with or without EA. Immunoblot analysis revealed that pretreatment with EA significantly increased extracellular ATP-induced phosphorylation of ASK1 compared with untreated cells, which correlated well with p38 activation (Fig. 5A). To determine whether EA affects extracellular ATP-induced ROS generation, we next assessed extracellular ATP-induced ROS generation in the presence or absence of EA. However, as shown in Fig. 5, B and C, FACS analysis using the ROS indicator 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) showed that EA did not affect extracellular ATP-induced ROS generation at all (Fig. 5, B and C). These data therefore suggest that EA potentiates extracellular ATP-induced ASK1 activation by a mechanism distinct from ROS generation. Extracellular ATP induces Ca2+ influx through the P2X7 receptor and leads to activation of Ca2+-dependent enzymes, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) (25León D. Hervás C. Miras-Portugal M.T. P2Y1 and P2X7 receptors induce calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation in cerebellar granule neurons.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 2999-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both ASK1 and CaMKII are closely linked to the pathogenesis and progression of CVDs (26Hayakawa R. Hayakawa T. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Therapeutic targets in the ASK1-dependent stress signaling pathways.Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2012; 88: 434-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Mattiazzi A. Bassani R.A. Escobar A.L. Palomeque J. Valverde C.A. Vila Petroff M. Bers D.M. Chasing cardiac physiology and pathology down the CaMKII cascade.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2015; 308: H1177-H1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and, more importantly, CaMKII functions as an activator of ASK1 (28Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Nishitoh H. Tobiume K. Kishida S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Ichijo H. Involvement of ASK1 in Ca2+-induced p38 MAP kinase activation.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be assumed that EA enhances ATP-induced ASK1 activation by positively regulating CaMKII activation. To address this possibility, we examined whether the CaMKII-specific inhibitor KN-93 prevents the increase in ATP-induced cell death mediated by EA. As shown in Fig. 6A, KN-93 significantly suppressed the EA-mediated promotion of ATP-induced cell death. Furthermore, KN-93 also markedly suppressed the enhancement of ATP-induced activation of ASK1 and p38 mediated by EA (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that CaMKII is involved in EA-mediated ASK1 activation. Given that EA enhances ATP-induced CaMKII activation, it is possible that P2X7 receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx is increased in the presence of EA. We therefore examined whether EA promotes ATP-induced Ca2+ influx using a Ca2+ indicator, Fluo-4. First we confirmed that intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations were not altered by OA or EA pretreatment (Fig. 6C). We then found that EA-pretreated cells showed a higher increase in Ca2+ influx than control cells, and observed a time delay of the Ca2+ influx in EA-pretreated cells for unknown reasons (Fig. 6, D and E). On the other hand, OA-pretreated cells showed a much higher increase than EA-pretreated cells (Fig. 6, D and E) even though OA failed to potentiate the ATP-induced p38 activation (Fig. 2B). In addition, the increased Ca2+ influx by pretreatment with EA or OA was almost completely inhibited by a P2X7 receptor inhibitor, CBB, suggesting that both fatty acids affect P2X7 receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx (Fig. 6D). However, considering that ATP-induced ERK activation, which is reported to depend on P2X7 receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx (29Gendron F.P. Neary J.T. Theiss P.M. Sun G.Y. Gonzalez F.A. Weisman G.A. Mechanisms of P2X7 receptor-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human astrocytoma cells.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C571-C581Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), was not altered in the presence of EA, as shown in Fig. 2A, the increased Ca2+ influx by EA appears not to influence downstream signaling. Collectively, these observations suggest that EA promotes CaMKII-dependent activation of the ASK1-p38 pathway independent of the increased Ca2+ influx. We next investigated the effect of EA on ATP-induced CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr-286, which is known to positively regulate CaMKII activity by enhancing its interaction with Ca2+/calmodulin (30Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H.

https://openalex.org/W2600388693,"A positive electrostatic field emanating from the center of the aquaporin (AQP) water and solute channel is responsible for the repulsion of cations. At the same time, however, a positive field will attract anions. In this regard, l-lactate/lactic acid permeability has been shown for various isoforms of the otherwise highly water and neutral substrate selective AQP family. The structural requirements rendering certain AQPs permeable for weak monoacids and the mechanism of conduction have remained unclear. Here, we show by profiling pH-dependent substrate permeability, measurements of media alkalization, and proton decoupling that AQP9 acts as a channel for the protonated, neutral monocarboxylic acid species. Intriguingly, the obtained permeability rates indicate an up to 10 times higher probability of passage via AQP9 than given by the fraction of the protonated acid substrate at a certain pH. We generated AQP9 point mutants showing that this effect is independent from properties of the channel interior but caused by the protein surface electrostatics. Monocarboxylic acid-conducting AQPs thus employ a mechanism similar to the family of formate-nitrite transporters for weak monoacids. On a more general basis, our data illustrate semiquantitatively the contribution of surface electrostatics to the interaction of charged molecule substrates or ligands with target proteins, such as channels, transporters, enzymes, or receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2599993798,"Abstract The type I cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) are key regulators of smooth muscle tone, cardiac hypertrophy, and other physiological processes. The two isoforms PKGIα and PKGIβ are thought to have unique functions because of their tissue-specific expression, different cGMP affinities, and isoform-specific protein-protein interactions. Recently, a non-canonical pathway of PKGIα activation has been proposed, in which PKGIα is activated in a cGMP-independent fashion via oxidation of Cys43, resulting in disulfide formation within the PKGIα N-terminal dimerization domain. A “redox-dead” knock-in mouse containing a C43S mutation exhibits phenotypes consistent with decreased PKGIα signaling, but the detailed mechanism of oxidation-induced PKGIα activation is unknown. Therefore, we examined oxidation-induced activation of PKGIα, and in contrast to previous findings, we observed that disulfide formation at Cys43 does not directly activate PKGIα in vitro or in intact cells. In transfected cells, phosphorylation of Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein was increased in response to 8-CPT-cGMP treatment, but not when disulfide formation in PKGIα was induced by H2O2. Using purified enzymes, we found that the Cys43 oxidation had no effect on basal kinase activity or Km and Vmax values; however, PKGIα containing the C43S mutation was less responsive to cGMP-induced activation. This reduction in cGMP affinity may in part explain the PKGIα loss-of-function phenotype of the C43S knock-in mouse. In conclusion, disulfide formation at Cys43 does not directly activate PKGIα, and the C43S-mutant PKGIα has a higher Ka for cGMP. Our results highlight that mutant enzymes should be carefully biochemically characterized before making in vivo inferences."
https://openalex.org/W2601067397,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) allows collaboration between humans and machines. It translates the electrical activity of the brain to understandable commands to operate a machine or a device. In this study, we propose a method to improve the accuracy of a 3-class BCI using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This BCI discriminates rest against imaginary grasps and elbow movements of the same limb. This classification task is challenging because imaginary movements within the same limb have close spatial representations on the motor cortex area. The proposed method extracts time-domain features and classifies them using a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis kernel function (RBF). An average accuracy of 74.2% was obtained when using the proposed method on a dataset collected, prior to this study, from 12 healthy individuals. This accuracy was higher than that obtained when other widely used methods, such as common spatial patterns (CSP), filter bank CSP (FBCSP), and band power methods, were used on the same dataset. These results are encouraging and the proposed method could potentially be used in future applications including BCI-driven robotic devices, such as a portable exoskeleton for the arm, to assist individuals with impaired upper extremity functions in performing daily tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2598685715,"Mutations in the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP) lead to multisystem proteinopathies including frontotemporal dementia. We have previously shown that patient-derived VCP mutant fibroblasts exhibit lower mitochondrial membrane potential, uncoupled respiration, and reduced ATP levels. This study addresses the underlying basis for mitochondrial uncoupling using VCP knockdown neuroblastoma cell lines, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and iPSC-derived cortical neurons from patients with pathogenic mutations in VCP Using fluorescent live cell imaging and respiration analysis we demonstrate a VCP mutation/knockdown-induced dysregulation in the adenine nucleotide translocase, which results in a slower rate of ADP or ATP translocation across the mitochondrial membranes. This deregulation can explain the mitochondrial uncoupling and lower ATP levels in VCP mutation-bearing neurons via reduced ADP availability for ATP synthesis. This study provides evidence for a role of adenine nucleotide translocase in the mechanism underlying altered mitochondrial function in VCP-related degeneration, and this new insight may inform efforts to better understand and manage neurodegenerative disease and other proteinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2602027544,"Capsaicin is an ingredient in spicy peppers that produces burning pain by activating transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a Ca2+-permeable ion channel in nociceptors. Capsaicin has also been used as an analgesic, and its topical administration is approved for the treatment of certain pain conditions. The mechanisms underlying capsaicin-induced analgesia likely involve reversible ablation of nociceptor terminals. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. To visualize TRPV1-lineage axons, a genetically engineered mouse model was used in which a fluorophore is expressed under the TRPV1 promoter. Using a combination of these TRPV1-lineage reporter mice and primary afferent cultures, we monitored capsaicin-induced effects on afferent terminals in real time. We found that Ca2+ influx through TRPV1 is necessary for capsaicin-induced ablation of nociceptive terminals. Although capsaicin-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was TRPV1-dependent, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibition of the mitochondrial transition permeability pore, and scavengers of reactive oxygen species did not attenuate capsaicin-induced ablation. In contrast, MDL28170, an inhibitor of the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain, diminished ablation. Furthermore, overexpression of calpastatin, an endogenous inhibitor of calpain, or knockdown of calpain 2 also decreased ablation. Quantitative assessment of TRPV1-lineage afferents in the epidermis of the hind paws of the reporter mice showed that EGTA and MDL28170 diminished capsaicin-induced ablation. Moreover, MDL28170 prevented capsaicin-induced thermal hypoalgesia. These results suggest that TRPV1/Ca2+/calpain-dependent signaling plays a dominant role in capsaicin-induced ablation of nociceptive terminals and further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of capsaicin on nociceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2598168794,"Adipose tissues constitute an important component of metabolism, the dysfunction of which can cause obesity and type II diabetes. Here we show that differentiation of white and brown adipocytes requires Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1), a Rho GTPase Activating Protein (RhoGAP) previously studied for its function in liver cancer. We identified Dlc1 as a super-enhancer associated gene in both white and brown adipocytes through analyzing the genome-wide binding profiles of PPARγ, the master regulator of adipogenesis. We further observed that Dlc1 expression increases during differentiation, and knockdown of Dlc1 by siRNA in white adipocytes reduces the formation of lipid droplets and the expression of fat marker genes. Moreover, knockdown of Dlc1 in brown adipocytes reduces expression of brown fat-specific genes and diminishes mitochondrial respiration. Dlc1-/- knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts show a complete inability to differentiate into adipocytes, but this phenotype can be rescued by inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and filamentous actin (F-actin), suggesting the involvement of Rho pathway in DLC1-regulated adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, PPARγ binds to the promoter of Dlc1 gene to regulate its expression during both white and brown adipocyte differentiation. These results identify DLC1 as an activator of white and brown adipocyte differentiation, and provide a molecular link between PPARγ and Rho pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2598617188,"Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in several stages of the cell cycle, including the entry and exit from mitosis, and cytokinesis. Furthermore, it has an essential role in the regulation of DNA replication. Together with cyclin A, PLK1 also promotes CDH1 phosphorylation to trigger its ubiquitination and degradation, allowing cell cycle progression. The PLK1 levels in different type of tumors are very high compared to normal tissues, which is consistent with its role in promoting proliferation. Therefore, several PLK1 inhibitors have been developed and tested for the treatment of cancer. Here, we further analyzed PLK1 degradation and found that cytoplasmic PLK1 is ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the SCFβTrCP/proteasome. This procedure is triggered when heat shock protein (HSP) 90 is inhibited with geldanamycin, which results in misfolding of PLK1. We also identified CDK1 as the major kinase involved in this degradation. Our work shows for the first time that HSP90 inhibition arrests cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition. This novel mechanism inhibits CDH1 degradation through CDK1-dependent PLK1 destruction by the SCFβTrCP/proteasome.

To analyze retinal PP thickness in relation to retinal sensitivity data from microperimetry (MP) in ADOA patients. Methods and findings This prospective cross-sectional study included 11 patients with ADOA and 11 age-matched healthy subjects. All participants underwent both a “Posterior Pole” and “peripapillary RNFL (pRNFL)” scanning protocol using SD-OCT. Functional mapping of the PP was also performed using MP. A customized program was implemented in order to achieve accurate superimposition of MP sensitivity map onto SD-OCT map. The thickness of the PP different retinal layers and pRNFL was obtained and measured for each eye. Mean retinal sensitivity values and fixation stability were obtained and compared between ADOA patients and healthy subjects. Correlation analysis was performed on a point-to-point basis to evaluate the association between mean thickness and retinal sensitivity of each retinal layer. Total retinal thickness (TRT), Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL), Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL), Inner Plexiform Layer (IPL), Inner Nuclear Layer (INL) and Inner Retinal Layers (IRL) at the posterior pole as well as pRNFL were significantly thinner in ADOA patients (P < 0.0001). On the contrary, the Outer Plexiform Layer (OPL) and the Outer Nuclear Layer (ONL) were significantly thicker in the ADOA group (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) and Outer Retinal Layers (ORL) thickness between ADOA and controls. The average PP retinal sensitivity was significantly reduced in ADOA patients compared with controls (P < 0.001), as measured by microperimeter Nidek MP-1 (MP1). Fixation stability was significantly worse in the ADOA group (P = 0.01). The most severe sensitivity defects in ADOA patients were found at the level of the papillo-macular bundle (PMB). Conclusions Inner retinal layers showed pathological changes in ADOA patients. In addition, the whole retinal PP (not only the PMB) was significantly altered in ADOA, both in terms of retinal thickness and sensitivity."

More recently, mouse models have taken over, the genetic manipulability of the mouse allowing the creation of genetically accurate models outweighed the disadvantage of its smaller brain size that limited time allowed for tumor progression. Here we illustrate a method that allows glioma formation in the rat using the replication competent avian-like sarcoma (RCAS) virus / tumor virus receptor-A (tv-a) transgenic system of post-natal cell type-specific gene transfer. The RCAS/tv-a model has emerged as a particularly versatile and accurate modeling technology by enabling spatial, temporal, and cell type-specific control of individual gene transformations and providing de novo formed glial tumors with distinct molecular subtypes mirroring human GBM. Nestin promoter-driven tv-a (Ntv-a) transgenic Sprague-Dawley rat founder lines were created and RCAS PDGFA and p53 shRNA constructs were used to initiate intracranial brain tumor formation. Tumor formation and progression were confirmed and visualized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy. The tumors were analyzed using histopathological and immunofluorescent techniques. All experimental animals developed large, heterogeneous brain tumors that closely resembled human GBM. Median survival was 92 days from tumor initiation and 62 days from the first point of tumor visualization on MRI. Each tumor-bearing animal showed time dependent evidence of malignant progression to high-grade glioma by MRI and neurological examination. Post-mortem tumor analysis demonstrated the presence of several key characteristics of human GBM, including high levels of tumor cell proliferation, pseudopalisading necrosis, microvascular proliferation, invasion of tumor cells into surrounding tissues, peri-tumoral reactive astrogliosis, lymphocyte infiltration, presence of numerous tumor-associated microglia- and bone marrow-derived macrophages, and the formation of stem-like cell niches within the tumor. This transgenic rat model may enable detailed interspecies comparisons of fundamental cancer pathways and clinically relevant experimental imaging procedures and interventions that are limited by the smaller size of the mouse brain."

LP4/2A is a hybrid linker peptide that contains the first nine amino acids of LP4 and 20 amino acids of 2A.

To verify the functions of 2A, LP4, and LP4/2A linker peptides in transgenic maize, six fusion protein vectors that each encoded a single open reading frame (ORF) incorporating two report genes, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and β-glucuronidase (GUS), separated by 2A (or modified 2A), LP4 or LP4/2A were assembled to compare the cleavage efficiency of the three linkers in a maize transient expression system. The results demonstrated the more protein production and higher cleavage splicing efficiency with the polyprotein construct linked by the LP4/2A peptide than those of the polyprotein constructs linked by 2A or LP4 alone. Seven other fusion proteins that each encoded a single ORF incorporating two different genes GFP and Red Fluorecent Protein (RFP) with different signal peptides were assembled to study the subcellular localization of genes linked by LP4/2A. The subcellular localization experiments suggested that both types of signal peptide, co-translational and post-translational, could lead their proteins to the target localization in maize protoplast transformed by LP4/2A polyprotein construct and it implied the LP4/2A linker peptide could alleviate the inhibition of 2A processing by the carboxy-terminal region of upstream protein of 2A when translocated into the ER."

https://openalex.org/W2602919574,"The regional policy in China is shifting from solely gross domestic product (GDP) orientation to development that is more balanced between economic growth and ecological protection, as well as achieving equality among regions. Using land use maps and the adjusted value coefficients to assess ecosystem service values (ESV) for the 1980s, 1995, 2000, and 2010, we estimated the ESV in Shaanxi Province for different years, and characterized the spatial and temporal distribution of ESV and GDP. The results demonstrated that the total value of ecosystem services in Shaanxi Province increased from 208.95 billion Yuan in the 1980s to 309.76 billion Yuan in 2010. Variation Coefficient (Cv) and Theil index (T) were used to reflect the disparities of GDP or ESV within the study area. The values of Cv in descending order are GDP, ESV per capita, ESV, and GDP per capita. The Theil indexes of GDP were much greater than the ones of ESV. Variations of Cv and T showed that disparity in GDP kept increasing from the 1980s to 2000, then decreased; while no significant change in regional disparity of ESV were detected in parallel. The cities with higher GDP usually contributed little to ESV, and vice versa. The variation in GDP and ESV, in terms of the prefectural totals and per capita values, increased from the 1980s to 2010. This study provides an accessible way for local decision makers to evaluate the regional balance between economic growth and ecosystem services."

https://openalex.org/W4234578019,"Despite advances in intracellular delivery technologies, efficient methods are still required that are vector-free, can address a wide range of cargo types and can be applied to cells that are difficult to transfect whilst maintaining cell viability. We have developed a novel vector-free method that uses reversible permeabilization to achieve rapid intracellular delivery of cargos with varying composition, properties and size. A permeabilizing delivery solution was developed that contains a low level of ethanol as the permeabilizing agent. Reversal of cell permeabilization is achieved by temporally and volumetrically controlling the contact of the target cells with this solution. Cells are seeded in conventional multi-well plates. Following removal of the supernatant, the cargo is mixed with the delivery solution and applied directly to the cells using an atomizer. After a short incubation period, permeabilization is halted by incubating the cells in a phosphate buffer saline solution that dilutes the ethanol and is non-toxic to the permeabilized cells. Normal culture medium is then added. The procedure lasts less than 5 min. With this method, proteins, mRNA, plasmid DNA and other molecules have been delivered to a variety of cell types, including primary cells, with low toxicity and cargo functionality has been confirmed in proof-of-principle studies. Co-delivery of different cargo types has also been demonstrated. Importantly, delivery occurs by diffusion directly into the cytoplasm in an endocytic-independent manner. Unlike some other vector-free methods, adherent cells are addressed in situ without the need for detachment from their substratum. The method has also been adapted to address suspension cells. This delivery method is gentle yet highly reproducible, compatible with high throughput and automated cell-based assays and has the potential to enable a broad range of research, drug discovery and clinical applications."

https://openalex.org/W2598398756,"The rapidly growing world population has a greatly increasing demand for plant biomass, thus creating a great interest in the development of methods to enhance the growth and biomass accumulation of crop species. In this study, we used zinc finger artificial transcription factor (ZF-ATF)-mediated genome interrogation to manipulate the growth characteristics and biomass of Arabidopsis plants. We describe the construction of two collections of Arabidopsis lines expressing fusions of three zinc fingers (3F) to the transcriptional repressor motif EAR (3F-EAR) or the transcriptional activator VP16 (3F-VP16), and the characterization of their growth characteristics. In total, six different 3F-ATF lines with a consistent increase in rosette surface area (RSA) of up to 55% were isolated. For two lines we demonstrated that 3F-ATF constructs function as dominant in trans acting causative agents for an increase in RSA and biomass, and for five larger plant lines we have investigated 3F-ATF induced transcriptomic changes. Our results indicate that genome interrogation can be used as a powerful tool for the manipulation of plant growth and biomass and that it might supply novel cues for the discovery of genes and pathways involved in these properties."
https://openalex.org/W2600269558,"Signaling between the epicardium and underlying myocardium is crucial for proper heart development. The complex molecular interactions and regulatory networks involved in this communication are not well understood. In this study, we integrated mass spectrometry with bioinformatics to systematically characterize the secretome of embryonic chicken EPDC-heart explant (EHE) co-cultures. The 150-protein secretome dataset established greatly expands the knowledge base of the molecular players involved in epicardial-myocardial signaling. We identified proteins and pathways that are implicated in epicardial-myocardial signaling for the first time, as well as new components of pathways that are known to regulate the crosstalk between epicardium and myocardium. The large size of the dataset enabled bioinformatics analysis to deduce networks for the regulation of specific biological processes and predicted signal transduction nodes within the networks. We performed functional analysis on one of the predicted nodes, NF-κB, and demonstrate that NF-κB activation is an essential step in TGFβ2/PDGFBB-induced cardiac epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In summary, we have generated a global perspective of epicardial-myocardial signaling for the first time, and our findings open exciting new avenues for investigating the molecular basis of heart development and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2599211059,"5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling and immunostaining is commonly used for the detection of DNA replication using specific antibodies. Previously, we found that these antibodies significantly differ in their affinity to BrdU. Our present data showed that one of the reasons for the differences in the replication signal is the speed of antibody dissociation. Whereas highly efficient antibodies created stable complexes with BrdU, the low efficiency antibodies were unstable. A substantial loss of the signal occurred within several minutes. The increase of the complex stability can be achieved by i) formaldehyde fixation or ii) a quick reaction with a secondary antibody. These steps allowed the same or even higher signal/background ratio to be reached as in the highly efficient antibodies. Based on our findings, we optimised an approach for the fully enzymatic detection of BrdU enabling the fast detection of replicational activity without a significant effect on the tested proteins or the fluorescence of the fluorescent proteins. The method was successfully applied for image and flow cytometry. The speed of the method is comparable to the approach based on 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine. Moreover, in the case of short labelling pulses, the optimised method is even more sensitive. The approach is also applicable for the detection of 5-trifluoromethyl-2'-deoxyuridine."

https://openalex.org/W2598589783,"Human hemochromatosis protein (HFE) is involved in iron metabolism. Two major HFE polymorphisms, H63D and C282Y, have been associated with an increased risk of cancers. Previously, we reported decreased gender effects in overall survival based on H63D or C282Y HFE polymorphisms patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the effect of other single nucleotide variation (SNV) in the HFE gene on the cancer development and progression has not been systematically studied. To expand our finding in a larger sample, and to identify other HFE SNV, we analyzed the frequency of somatic SNV in HFE gene and its relationship to survival in GBM patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM (Caucasian only) database. We found 9 SNVs with increased frequency in blood normal of TCGA GBM patients compared to the 1000Genome. Among 9 SNVs, 7 SNVs were located in the intron and 2 SNVs (i.e., H63D, C282Y) in the exon of HFE gene. The statistical analysis demonstrated that blood normal samples of TCGA GBM have more H63D (p = 0.0002, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.2119–0.3223) or C282Y (p = 0.0129, 95% CI: 0.0474–0.1159) HFE polymorphisms than 1000Genome. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the 264 GBM samples revealed no difference between wild type (WT) HFE and H63D, and WT HFE and C282Y GBM patients. In addition, there was no difference in the survival of male/female GBM patients based on HFE genotype. There was no correlation between HFE expression and survival. In conclusion, the current results suggest that somatic HFE polymorphisms do not impact GBM patients’ survival in the TCGA data set of GBM."

Ablation of the Prip genes in mice impairs female fertility, which is manifested by fewer pregnancies, a decreased number of pups, and the decreased and increased secretion of gonadal steroids and gonadotropins, respectively. We investigated the involvement of the PRIPs in fertility, focusing on the ovaries of Prip-1 and -2 double-knock-out (DKO) mice. Multiple cystic follicles were observed in DKO ovaries, and a superovulation assay showed a markedly decreased number of ovulated oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes showed normal expansion, and artificial gonadotropin stimulation regulated the ovulation-related genes in a normal fashion, suggesting that the ovulation itself was probably normal. A histological analysis showed atresia in fewer follicles of the DKO ovaries, particularly in the secondary follicle stages. The expression of luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) was aberrantly higher in developing follicles, and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, a downstream target of LH-LHR signaling, was higher in DKO granulosa cells. This suggests that the up-regulation of LH-LHR signaling is the cause of impaired follicle development. The serum estradiol level was lower, but estradiol production was unchanged in the DKO ovaries. These results suggest that PRIPs are positively involved in the development of follicles via their regulation of LH-LHR signaling and estradiol secretion. Female DKO mice had higher serum levels of insulin, testosterone, and uncarboxylated osteocalcin, which, together with reduced fertility, are reminiscent of polycystic ovary syndrome in humans.

Whether S100B in psychotic disorder mirrors pathophysiological mechanisms (which elicit exacerbation of disease) or compensatory action is unclear, as is its validity as a proxy marker for brain status. Insight may be gained by examining associations between serum S100B and indices of grey (cortical thickness (CT)) and white matter (fractional anisotropy (FA)), in relation to the absence or presence of (increased risk of) psychotic disorder. Blood samples and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired in 32 patients with psychotic disorder, 44 non-psychotic siblings of patients with psychotic disorder and 26 controls. Interactions between S100B and group were examined in separate models of CT and FA measures with multilevel regression analyses weighted for number of vertices and voxels (i.e. units of volume) respectively. All analyses were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), scan sequence, handedness and highest level of education. Neither CT nor FA was associated with S100B. There were no significant S100B × group interactions (CT: χ2 = 0.044, p = 0.978; FA: χ2 = 3.672, p = 0.159). No evidence was present for S100B as a proxy marker of grey or white matter status.

https://openalex.org/W2600232277,"Regulators of the WhiB-like (wbl) family are playing important role in the complex regulation of metabolic and morphological differentiation in Streptomyces. In this study, we investigated the role of wblI, a member of this family, in the regulation of secondary metabolite production in Streptomyces lividans. The over-expression of wblI was correlated with an enhanced biosynthesis of undecylprodigiosin and actinorhodin and with a reduction of the biosynthesis of yCPK and of the grey spore pigment encoded by the whiE locus. Five regulatory targets of WblI were identified using in vitro formaldehyde crosslinking and confirmed by EMSA and qRT-PCR. These included the promoter regions of wblI itself, two genes of the ACT cluster (actVA3 and the intergenic region between the divergently orientated genes actII-1 and actII-2) and that of wblA, another member of the Wbl family. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of actVA3 encoding a protein of unknown function as well as that of actII-1, a TetR regulator repressing the expression of actII-2, encoding the ACT transporter, were down regulated in the WblI over-expressing strain. Consistently the expression of the transporter actII-2 was up-regulated. The expression of WblA, that is known to have a negative impact on ACT biosynthesis, was strongly down regulated in the WblI over-expressing strain. These data are consistent with the positive impact that WblI over-expression has on ACT biosynthesis. The latter might result from direct activation of ACT biosynthesis and export and from repression of the expression of WblA, a likely indirect, repressor of ACT biosynthesis."

Several factors have been identified that could be responsible for the collapse of honeybee populations. However, Raymann et al. have identified an antibiotic that appears to reduce bee survival by changing the bee microbiome. Hives are frequently treated with tetracycline to prevent infections. When bees were fed tetracycline for 5 days in a laboratory and reintroduced to their hives, half as many survived after 3 days, relative to controls. Antibiotic treatment decreased the number and relative abundance of the bacteria living in the bee gut. After treatment, bees were more sensitive to infection by a Serratia species of bacterial pathogen. Bees that were germ-free showed no changes after tetracycline treatment, suggesting that tetracycline was acting on the microbiome and not directly on the bees.

Cancer patients with metastases in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have a poor prognosis. How cancer cells survive in the CSF has been an enigma because this microenvironment is devoid of mitogens and nutrients required for cell growth. Studying mice and patient samples, Boire et al. show that cancer cells metastasizing to the CSF overexpress a protein called complement component 3 (C3). C3 activates a specific receptor in the choroid plexus epithelium, a barrier system in the brain that prevents cells and molecules in the blood from entering the CSF. This activation disrupts the blood-CSF barrier, allowing circulating growth factors into the CSF. A drug that blocks this activation suppressed metastasis to the CSF in mice.
