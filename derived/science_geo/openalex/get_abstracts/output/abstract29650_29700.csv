https://openalex.org/W1984751884,"The ubiquitous Oct-1 and lymphoid Oct-2 POU homeodomain transcription factors bind to the same DNA sequence but differ in their activation potential. Oct-2 is a positive, negative, or neutral regulator of β-globin transcription depending on the position and sequence of multimerized binding sites. To activate transcription, Oct-2 relies on two interdependent nonacidic domains, an N-terminal glutamine-rich region and a C-terminal serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich region. Oct-1 also contains a functional glutamine-rich region but fails to activate β-globin transcription in our assay because the Oct-1 C-terminus is inactive, indicating that differential activation by Oct-1 and Oct-2 is determined by the combination of multiple activation domains. Oct-2 displays a unique phosphorylation pattern that is absent from molecules lacking one or the other activation domain, suggesting the activation domains have a role in inducing protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2161061374,"In response to water spray, subirrigation, wind, touch, wounding, or darkness, Arabidopsis regulates the expression of at least four touch-induced (TCH) genes. Ten to thirty minutes after stimulation, mRNA levels increase up to 100-fold. Arabidopsis plants stimulated by touch develop shorter petioles and bolts. This developmental response is known as thigmomorphogenesis. TCH 1 cDNA encodes the putative Arabidopsis calmodulin differing in one amino acid from wheat calmodulin. Sequenced regions of TCH 2 and TCH 3 contain 44% and 70% amino acid identities to calmodulin, respectively. The regulation of this calmodulin-related gene family in Arabidopsis suggests that calcium ions and calmodulin are involved in transduction of signals from the environment, enabling plants to sense and respond to environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W2072320617,"Introduction of a normal retinoblastoma gene (RB) into retinoblastoma cells was previously shown to suppress several aspects of their neoplastic phenotype, including tumorigenicity in nude mice, thereby directly demonstrating a cancer suppression function of RB. To explore the possibility of a similar activity in a common adult tumor, RB expression was examined in three human prostate carcinoma cell lines. One of these, DU145, contained an abnormally small protein translated from an RB messenger RNA transcript that lacked 105 nucleotides encoded by exon 21. To assess the functional consequences of this mutation, normal RB expression was restored in DU145 cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Cells that maintained stable exogenous RB expression lost their ability to form tumors in nude mice, although their growth rate in culture was apparently unaltered. These results suggest that RB inactivation can play a significant role in the genesis of a common adult neoplasm and that restoration of normal RB-encoded protein in tumors could have clinical utility."

https://openalex.org/W2057345278,"The P30 protein of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is required for cell to cell movement of viral RNA, which presumably occurs through plant intercellular connections, the plasmodesmata. The mechanism by which P30 mediates transfer of TMV RNA molecules through plasmodesmata channels is unknown. We have identified P30 as an RNA and single-stranded (ss) DNA binding protein. Binding of purified P30 to ss nucleic acids is strong, highly cooperative, and sequence nonspecific with a minimal binding site of 4-7 nucleotides per P30 monomer. In-frame deletions across P30 were used to localize the ss nucleic acid binding domain to within amino acid residues 65-86 of the protein. We propose that binding of P30 to TMV RNA creates an unfolded protein-RNA complex that functions as an intermediate in virus cell to cell movement through plasmodesmata."
https://openalex.org/W1967561978,"Protein unfolding and the dissolution of hydrophobic compounds (including solids, liquids, and gases) in water are characterized by a linear relation between entropy change and heat capacity change. The same slope is found for various classes of compounds, whereas the intercept depends on the particular class. The feature common to these processes is exposure of hydrophobic groups to water. These observations make possible the assignment of the heat capacity change to hydrophobic solvation and lead to the description of protein stability in terms of a hydrophobic and a nonhydrophobic contribution. A general representation of protein stability is given by the heat capacity change and the temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1973526911,"Chromosome banding analysis of human malignant melanoma has documented the nonrandom alteration of chromosome 6. To determine the relevance of chromosome 6 abnormalities in melanoma, a normal chromosome 6 was directly introduced into melanoma cell lines. The resulting (+6) microcell hybrids were significantly altered in their phenotypic properties in culture and lost their ability to form tumors in nude mice. The loss of the chromosome 6 from melanoma microcell hybrids resulted in the reversion to tumorigenicity of these cells in mice. The introduction of the selectable marker (psv2neo) alone into melanoma cell lines had no effect on tumorigenicity. These results support the idea that one or more genes on chromosome 6 may control the malignant expression of human melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2000831227,A physical model in which cells are considered as possible detectors of very weak periodic electric fields yields a general relation between cell size and both thermally induced fluctuations in membrane potential and the maximum change in membrane potential caused by an applied field. The simplest version of the model provides a broad-band estimate of the smallest applied electric field to which membrane macromolecules can directly respond (about 10-3 volt per centimeter). Much smaller fields (10-6 volt per centimeter) can be detected if there is a response in only a narrow band of frequencies or if signal averaging occurs through field-induced variation in the catalytic activity of membrane-associated enzymes. Both extensions of the simplest version remove the apparent violation of the thermal noise limit found in some experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2072151643,"The task of visual search is to determine as rapidly as possible whether a target item is present or absent in a display. Rapidly detected items are thought to contain features that correspond to primitive elements in the human visual system. In previous theories, it has been assumed that visual search is based on simple two-dimensional features in the image. However, visual search also has access to another level of representation, one that describes properties in the corresponding three-dimensional scene. Among these properties are three dimensionality and the direction of lighting, but not viewing direction. These findings imply that the parallel processes of early vision are much more sophisticated than previously assumed."
https://openalex.org/W1999203970,"We studied the postsynthetic sorting of endogenous plasma membrane proteins in a polarized epithelial cell line, Caco-2. Pulse-chase radiolabeling was combined with domain-specific cell surface assays to monitor the arrival of three apical and one basolateral protein at the apical and basolateral cell surface. Apical proteins were inserted simultaneously into both membrane domains. The fraction targeted to the basolateral domain was different for the three apical proteins and was subsequently sorted to the apical domain by transcytosis at different rates. In contrast, a basolateral protein was found in the basolateral membrane only. Thus, sorting of plasma membrane proteins occurred from two sites: the Golgi apparatus and the basolateral membrane. These data explain apparently conflicting results of earlier studies."
https://openalex.org/W1658669968,"Sterol-dependent regulation of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor promoter has been localized previously to a 16-base pair sequence, designated repeat 2, in the 5'-flanking region of the gene. In the current study, we show that the central 10 nucleotides of repeat 2 are crucial for the sterol regulatory activity. This sequence includes an octamer, designated sterol regulatory element 1 (SRE-1), which was identified previously in the promoter of the gene for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, a sterol-regulated enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. We made a series of single-base substitutions within a 1471-base pair fragment of the intact LDL receptor promoter, introduced the mutant plasmids into hamster cells by transfection, and measured mRNA levels in the absence and presence of sterols. Substitutions within the 10-base pair sequence in repeat 2 largely prevented the induction of transcription which occurs in the absence of sterols. None of these point mutations affected transcription in the presence of sterols. Like an enhancer, the SRE-1 in repeat 2 functioned in an orientation-independent manner. We interpret these findings to indicate that the SRE-1 of the LDL receptor promoter is a conditional positive element that cooperates with other elements to enhance transcription in the absence of sterols and loses its function in the presence of sterols."

Optoelectronic 'neurons' fabricated from semiconducting materials can be connected by holographic images recorded in photorefractive crystals. Processes such as learning can be demonstrated using holographic optical neural networks.
https://openalex.org/W2049108188,"The control of cellular senescence by specific human chromosomes was examined in interspecies cell hybrids between diploid human fibroblasts and an immortal, Syrian hamster cell line. Most such hybrids exhibited a limited life span comparable to that of the human fibroblasts, indicating that cellular senescence is dominant in these hybrids. Karyotypic analyses of the hybrid clones that did not senesce revealed that all these clones had lost both copies of human chromosome 1, whereas all other human chromosomes were observed in at least some of the immortal hybrids. The application of selective pressure for retention of human chromosome 1 to the cell hybrids resulted in an increased percentage of hybrids that senesced. Further, the introduction of a single copy of human chromosome 1 to the hamster cells by microcell fusion caused typical signs of cellular senescence. Transfer of chromosome 11 had no effect on the growth of the cells. These findings indicate that human chromosome 1 may participate in the control of cellular senescence and further support a genetic basis for cellular senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2154901034,"The SCID-hu mouse, engrafted with human hematolymphoid organs, is permissive for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This mouse model was used to test compounds for antiviral efficacy. Two weeks after infection with HIV, 100 percent (40/40) of SCID-hu mice were positive for HIV by the polymerase chain reaction. When first treated with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), none (0/17) were HIV-positive by this assay. However, AZT-treated SCID-hu mice did have a few infected cells; after AZT treatment was stopped, viral spread was detected by polymerase chain reaction in such mice. Thus, the SCID-hu mouse provides a means to directly compare new antiviral compounds with AZT and to further improve antiviral efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1547948326,"To ascertain the molecular mechanism that causes murine C5 deficiency, genomic and cDNA libraries were constructed from mouse liver DNA and mRNA employing the congenic strains B10.D2/nSnJ and B10.D2/oSnJ that are sufficient and deficient for C5, respectively. Genomic fragments were isolated which correspond to PvuII and HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphisms associated with C5 deficiency. Sequence analyses demonstrated that each of these polymorphisms resulted from single base pair substitutions and that neither substitution would probably cause or contribute to the C5 deficiency. Sequence analyses of C5 sufficient and deficient cDNAs revealed a 2 base-pair deletion in the deficient cDNAs. The TA deletion was located near the 5' end of the cDNA. This deletion shifts the reading frame of the C5 mRNA so that the termination codon UGA is present 4 base pairs downstream from the deletion. Genomic DNA was amplified and sequenced corresponding to the area surrounding the 2-base pair deletion. Six C5-deficient strains, A/HeJ, AKR/J, DBA/2J, NZB/B1NJ, SWR/J, and B10.D2/oSnJ, and four C5-sufficient strains, Balb/CJ, C57Bl/6J, DBA/1J, and B10.D2/nSnJ, were analyzed. The sequencing data revealed that the 2 base pairs were deleted from the C5 gene of each deficient mouse tested but not from the C5 gene of any sufficient mouse. These data demonstrate that: 1) there is an identical 2-base pair deletion in an exon of the C5 gene in several different C5-deficient mouse strains; 2) the mRNA transcribed from the C5D gene retains this deletion; and 3) this mutation should result in C5 protein deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1485824567,"Peroxisomal delta 3, delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8) was studied in the liver of rats treated with clofibrate. The mitochondrial and peroxisomal isoenzymes were separated chromatographically and the peroxisomal isomerase purified to apparent homogeneity. In addition to the isomerization of 3-enoyl-CoA esters, the purified protein also catalyzed hydration of trans-2-enoyl-CoA and oxidation of L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. Incubation of the purified protein with trans-3-decenoyl-CoA, NAD+, and Mg2+ resulted in an increase in absorbance at 303 nm, indicating the formation of 3-ketoacyl-CoA. The protein purified was monomeric, with an estimated molecular weight of 78,000. In immunoblotting it was recognized by the antibody to peroxisomal bifunctional protein from rat liver. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of cyanogen bromide cleaved isomerase with the known sequence of the peroxisomal bifunctional protein from the rat identified them as the same molecule. In control experiments, the peroxisomal bifunctional protein purified according to published methods also catalyzed delta 3, delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerization. This means that the bifunctional protein of rat liver is in fact a trifunctional enzyme possessing delta 3, delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase (EC 4.2.1.17), and L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35) activities in the same polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1593275274,"Lignin peroxidase compound III (LiPIII) was prepared via three procedures: (a) ferrous LiP + O2 (LiPIIIa), (b) ferric LiP + O2-. (LiPIIIb), and (c) LiP compound II + excess H2O2 followed by treatment with catalase (LiPIIIc). LiPIIIa, b, and c each have a Soret maximum at approximately 414 nm and visible bands at 543 and 578 nm. LiPIIIa, b, and c each slowly reverted to native ferric LiP, releasing stoichiometric amounts of O2-. in the process. Electronic absorption spectra of LiPIII reversion to the native enzyme displayed isosbestic points in the visible region at 470, 525, and 597 nm, suggesting a single-step reversion with no intermediates. The LiPIII reversion reactions obeyed first-order kinetics with rate constants of approximately 1.0 X 10(-3) s-1. In the presence of excess peroxide, at pH 3.0, native LiP, LiPII, and LiPIIIa, b, and c are all converted to a unique oxidized species (LiPIII*) with a spectrum displaying visible bands at 543 and 578 nm, but with a Soret maximum at 419 nm, red-shifted 5 nm from that of LiPIII. LiPIII* is bleached and inactivated in the presence of excess H2O2 via a biphasic process. The fast first phase of this bleaching reaction obeys second-order kinetics, with a rate constant of 1.7 X 10(1) M-1 s-1. Addition of veratryl alcohol to LiPIII* results in its rapid reversion to the native enzyme, via an apparent one-step reaction that obeys second-order kinetics with a rate constant of 3.5 X 10(1) M-1 s-1. Stoichiometric amounts of O2-. are released during this reaction. When this reaction was run under conditions that prevented further reactions, HPLC analysis of the products demonstrated that veratryl alcohol was not oxidized. These results suggest that the binding of veratryl alcohol to LiPIII* displaces O2-., thus returning the enzyme to its native state. In contrast, the addition of veratryl alcohol to LiPIII did not affect the rate of spontaneous reversion of LiPIII to the native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1495099697,"Carboxypeptidase E (CPE), a peptide hormone-processing enzyme, is present within secretory granules in both a soluble form and a form which is membrane-bound at pH 5.5 but soluble at neutral pH. Antisera raised against a peptide corresponding to the predicted COOH-terminus of CPE bind to the membrane-associated form of CPE but not to the soluble form. This COOH-terminal region is predicted to form an amphiphilic alpha-helix, containing several pairs of hydrophobic residues separated by hydrophilic residues. Synthetic COOH-terminal peptides 11-24 residues in length are able to bind to bovine pituitary membranes and can be extracted by conditions that extract the membrane-bound form of CPE. The influence of pH on the membrane binding of a 21-residue COOH-terminal peptide is similar to the membrane binding of CPE: at pH values less than 6 the majority of the peptide is membrane-bound, while at pH values above 8 less than 20% is membrane-bound. Both the 21-residue COOH-terminal peptide and the purified membrane form of CPE, but not the soluble form, partition into Triton X-114 only at low pH (pH less than 6). Combined polar and hydrophobic interactions of the COOH-terminal peptide appear to be responsible for the reversible, pH-dependent association of CPE with membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1571280577,"Vitamin D3 treatment of the human promyelocytic cell line, HL-60, is accompanied by an increase in phorbol ester receptor number (Martell, R. E., Simpson, R. U., and Taylor, J. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5570-5575). In this study, the mechanism and significance of vitamin D3-induced changes in protein kinase C levels were investigated. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) resulted in a 2-3-fold increase in phorbol dibutyrate binding at 24 h. This was accompanied by a 4.2-fold increase in steady state mRNA levels for the beta isoenzyme of protein kinase C and by a 3.8-fold increase in its transcriptional rate as determined from nuclear run-off studies. Protein kinase C alpha mRNA, which was approximately 15% of the beta isoenzyme levels, showed similar increases in mRNA and transcriptional rates in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Protein kinase C gamma mRNA was not detected. The increases in protein kinase C levels were accompanied by increases in activation of the enzyme by phorbol esters. More importantly, 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused a 1.5-2.0-fold increase in the endogenous phosphorylation of protein kinase C substrates independent of exogenous activators or endogenous formation of diacylglycerol. This is the first report of transcriptional activation of protein kinase C. This mechanism of up-regulation of protein kinase C may explain the increased activity of protein kinase C in vitamin D3-treated HL-60 cells, and may constitute an important mechanism for the long term modulation of the protein kinase C pathway of cell regulation independent of diacylglycerol generation."
https://openalex.org/W1972744988,"Rapid technological advances and upward pressure on wages of hospital personnel are leading to a steady increase in health care spending that is absorbing an ever-larger fraction of gross national product. Eliminating inefficiencies in the system can provide brief fiscal relief, but rationing of beneficial services, even to the well-insured, offers the only prospect for sustained reduction in the growth of health care spending. The United States, which has negligible direct experience with rationing, can learn about choices it will face from the experience of Great Britain where health care has been rationed explicitly for many years."
https://openalex.org/W1670168104,"Binding to, and activation of, protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol ester (PE) tumor promoters may underlie their tumor-promoting activity. To study the effects of long-term PE treatment on regulation of cellular PKC, we adapted the human leukemic T cell line, Jurkat (JK), to continuous growth in the presence of PE. Such cells (JKPE) displayed loss of CD2 and CD3 cell surface molecules, known to play an important role in agonist-stimulated T cell activation, unresponsiveness to stimuli that induce interleukin 2 (IL2) receptor expression or IL2 production, change in the expression of several cell cycle-regulated genes, and a 6-fold reduction in cellular PKC enzymatic activity. This reduction was accompanied by the disappearance of a major approximately 82-kDa immunoreactive protein in JKPE cytosol when cell extracts were immunoblotted with a polyclonal anti-PKC peptide antibody cross-reactive with the PKC isoenzymes, alpha, beta, and gamma. Analysis with additional anti-peptide antibodies specific for alpha, beta, or gamma PKC indicated that all three types of PKC are expressed in JK cells; however, JKPE cells lost a major approximately 82 kDa immunoreactive cytosolic protein detectable with anti-PKC alpha antibody. In contrast, levels of expression and subcellular distribution of immunoreactive PKC beta and PKC gamma, as well as levels of mRNA specific for the three PKC isoenzymes, were not significantly affected by chronic PE treatment. These results indicate that PE-mediated reduction of PKC in JKPE cells is selective and occurs at the protein, not mRNA, level, and support the notion that distinct isoenzymes encoded by the PKC multigene family may be independently regulated. Moreover, the correlation between phenotypic and functional changes on one hand, and the selective reduction of PKC alpha on the other, raises the possibility that expression of CD2 and/or CD3 and functional activation in JKPE cells are preferentially regulated by PKC alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1524624799,"Three polypeptide neurotoxins (curtatoxins) were isolated from the venom of the spider Hololena curta by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, gel permeation, and ion-exchange chromatography. The purified toxins induced an immediate paralysis in the cricket Acheta domestica that resulted in desiccation and death of the insect within 24-48 h (LD50 congruent to 4-20 micrograms/g); this toxic effect is consistent with irreversible presynaptic neuromuscular blockade. Curtatoxins are a class of sequence-related, cysteine-rich, carboxyl-terminal amidated polypeptides of 36 to 38 amino acid residues. The cysteine residues are conserved at identical sequence positions among these polypeptides and form 4 intramolecular disulfide bonds. Hydropathy calculations show that the toxins have an internal hydrophobic region flanked by hydrophilic and oppositely charged amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends. By analogy to other cysteine-rich arthropod venom proteins, the folded structure of the curtatoxins is likely important for their target specificity and mode of action at the neuromuscular junction."
https://openalex.org/W2035535208,"Between 1947 and 1987 expenditures for health care in the United States grew 2.5 percent per annum faster than expenditures for other goods and services. The health sector's share of the gross national product rose from well under 5 percent in the late 1940s to more than 11 percent in the late 1980s. The expenditures gap has two components: health care prices rose 1.6 percent per annum more rapidly than other prices, while the quantity of health care grew 0.9 percent per annum faster than other quantities. Many factors, including wages, productivity, technology, and insurance contributed to these trends. No single explanation suffices, and no simple solution is apparent."
https://openalex.org/W1483610007,"Further characterization of a proline-rich cell wall protein gene family from soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) has been accomplished by the isolation and sequence analysis of two additional genes, SbPRP2 and SbPRP3, which encode mRNAs of 1050 and 650 nucleotides in length, respectively. Like the proline-rich protein gene, SbPRP1, which was previously reported (Hong, J. C., Nagao, R. T., and Key, J. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8367-8376), these two SbPRP genes encode proteins having a signal peptide sequence and repeats of Pro-Pro-Val-Tyr-Lys. The SbPRP2 gene encodes a protein of 26 kDa which contains a perfect alternating repeat of Pro-Pro-Val-Tyr-Lys and Pro-Pro-Val-Glu-Lys. The SbPRP3 encodes a 10-kDa protein which also contains Pro-Pro-Val-Tyr-Lys as a major amino acid repeat, but the overall amino acid sequence of this protein is more variable than that of SbPRP1 and SbPRP2. RNA blot analyses have demonstrated that there are marked differences in the pattern of expression of each SbPRP in various soybean tissues. In contrast, sequence analysis reveals that the SbPRP genes contain a high degree of sequence conservation. Nucleotide sequence homology extends 90 to 100 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site and includes typical CAT and TATA sequences. Approximately 80 base pairs of the 3'-noncoding sequence around the polyadenylation signal is also highly conserved. Therefore, the DNA sequence upstream of the 5'-conserved region is presumed to contain cis-elements accounting for the developmental and tissue specificity of gene expression. While the pentameric repeat structures occur in all SbPRP genes, the encoded proteins are predicted to be different in several features including basicity, substitutions of tyrosine and glutamic acid in the repeat, and the size of the mature protein."
https://openalex.org/W2118723909,"alpha 1-Antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) was recently identified as a major physiologic plasma inhibitor of activated protein C. The reaction with activated protein C of recombinant alpha 1-AT containing amino acid substitutions at the reactive center was studied. The substitution of Arg358 for Met, as observed in a patient with a severe bleeding disorder with the mutant alpha 1-AT Pittsburgh, increased the association rate constant for activated protein C from 1.1 x 10(1) to 4.9 x 10(4) M-1 s-1. The association rate constant of activated protein C with protein C inhibitor, a native plasma serpin that contains Arg354 at the reactive site, is 6 x 10(3) M-1 s-1 in the absence of heparin. Plasma containing 4 microM [Arg358]alpha 1-AT inhibited activated protein C activity by greater than 95% in 15 s, and the inhibited activated protein C was shown by immunoblotting to exist as activated protein C-inhibitor complexes. In controls 50% loss of activated protein C activity in normal plasma occurred in 19 min. Double-substituted [Pro357,Met358]alpha 1-AT----[Ala357,Arg358]alpha 1-AT had similar reactivity toward activated protein C as the single-substituted [Arg358]alpha 1-AT. Thus, replacement of the reactive center Met358 of alpha 1-AT by Arg358, analogous to Arg354 of protein C inhibitor, results in an activated protein C inhibitor that is more potent than either of the native inhibitors. Comparison of the association rate constant of the [Arg358]alpha 1-AT for activated protein C to that for thrombin (4 x 10(4) versus 3 x 10(5) M-1 s-1) suggests that thrombin would be more effectively inhibited than activated protein C, thereby giving an explanation for bleeding rather than thrombosis in the alpha 1-AT Pittsburgh patient."
https://openalex.org/W1542956071,"This study describes a homozygous, G----A transition at the moderately conserved +5 position within the splice donor site of intron 14 in the human alpha 1(I) collagen gene. The mutation reduced the efficiency of normal splice-site selection since the exon upstream of the mutation was spliced alternatively. Moreover, the extent of alternative splicing was sensitive to the temperature at which the mutant cells were grown, suggesting that the mutation directly affected spliceosome assembly. To achieve exon skipping, this effect must be propagated so as to disrupt the selection of a second splice site in the adjacent intron."
https://openalex.org/W1503195546,"The cross-linking of the F-actin-caldesmon complex with 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide generated four major adducts which were identified on polyacrylamide gels. By cross-linking 3H-actin to 14C-caldesmon, these were found to represent 1:1 cross-linked complexes of actin and caldesmon displaying different electrophoretic mobilities. Tropomyosin did not noticeably affect the cross-linking process. The same four fluorescent species resulting from the cross-linking of caldesmon to F-actin labeled with N-[7-(dimethylamino)-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl]maleimide were subjected separately to partial cleavages with hydroxylamine or cyanogen bromide. These treatments yielded fluorescent 41- and 37-kDa fragments, respectively, from each cross-linked entity indicating unambiguously that caldesmon was cross-linked only to the NH2-terminal actin stretch of residues 1-12. This region is also known to serve for the carbodiimide-mediated cross-linking of the myosin subfragment-1 heavy chain (Sutoh, K. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 3654-3661). A covalent caldesmon-F-actin conjugate containing a protein molar ratio close to 1:19 was isolated following dissociation of uncross-linked caldesmon. It showed a low level of activation of the ATPase activity of skeletal myosin subfragment-1, and the binding of Ca2(+)-calmodulin to the derivative did not cause the reversal of the ATPase inhibition. In contrast, the reversible binding of caldesmon to F-actin cross-linked to myosin subfragment-1 did not inhibit the accelerated ATPase of the complex. The overall data point to the dual involvement of the actin's NH2 terminus in the inhibitory binding of caldesmon and in actomyosin interactions in the presence of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1489129443,"alpha-Sarcin is a cytotoxic protein that inactivates ribosomes by hydrolyzing a single phosphodiester bond on the 3' side of G-4325 in eukaryotic 28 S rRNA. We have examined the requirements for the recognition by alpha-sarcin of this domain using a synthetic oligoribonucleotide (35-mer) that reproduces the sequence and, we presume, the secondary structure (a stem, a bulged nucleotide, and a loop) at the site of modification. The wild type structure and a large number of variants were transcribed in vitro from synthetic DNA templates with phage T7 RNA polymerase. Recognition of the substrate is strongly favored by a G at the position that corresponds to 4325. There is an absolute requirement for a helical stem; however, it can be reduced from the 7 base pairs in the natural structure to 3 without loss of specificity. The nature of the base pairs in the stem modifies but does not abolish recognition; whereas, the bulged nucleotide does not contribute to identification. Cleavage is materially affected by altering the nucleotides in the universal sequence surrounding G-4325 and changing the position in the loop of the tetranucleotide GAG(sarcin)A leads to loss of recognition by the toxin. We propose that the alpha-sarcin domain RNA participates in elongation factor catalyzed binding of aminoacyl-tRNA and of translocation; that translocation is driven by transitions in the structure of the alpha-sarcin domain RNA initiated by the binding of the factors, or the hydrolysis of GTP, or both; and that to toxin inactivates the ribosomes by preventing this transition."
https://openalex.org/W1482242717,"Although pairs of basic amino acids are common endoproteolytic sites in prohormones, the enzymes responsible for these cleavages have not yet been characterized. To investigate the specificity of these endoproteases, cDNAs encoding pro-neuropeptide Y (pro-NPY) containing all four pairs of basic amino acids were expressed in AtT-20 cells. Pro-NPY was selected as a model substrate because it undergoes a single cleavage at the sequence -Lys-Arg- during posttranslational processing. AtT-20 cells, a mouse anterior pituitary corticotrope line, were selected because they synthesize pro-adrenocorticotropic hormone (pro-ACTH)/endorphin and cleave a well characterized subset of the eight pairs of basic amino acids in the precursor. Altered cDNAs encoding pro-NPY with -Arg-Arg-, -Arg-Lys-, or Lys-Lys- at the cleavage site were used to generate stable cell lines. The production of NPY and the carboxyl-terminal peptide was studied using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography, tryptic peptide mapping, and microsequencing. Direct amino acid labeling confirmed the identity of the pair of basic amino acids at the cleavage site. Even when the four pairs of basic amino acids were presented in the same structural context, the rate, extent, and type of cleavage was substrate-specific. Pro-NPY(-Arg-Arg-) was cleaved at a rate similar to that observed for the wild-type pro-NPY(-Lys-Arg-). In contrast, pro-NPY(-Arg-Lys-) was cleaved at a much lower rate, and pro-NPY (-Lys-Lys-) was cleaved very poorly. Following endoproteolytic cleavage, the pair of basic amino acids present did not alter the production of mature NPY with a COOH-terminal Tyr-NH2. While two of the three mutant pro-NPY molecules were processed to wild-type carboxyl-terminal peptide, the carboxyl-terminal peptide derived from pro-NPY(-Arg-Lys-) contained an amino-terminal lysine residue, indicating that biosynthetic endoproteolysis occurred in the middle or at the amino terminus of the pair of basic amino acid residues at the cleavage site. Expression of wild-type or mutant pro-NPY inhibited cleavages within the endogenous pro-ACTH/endorphin; poorly cleaved pro-NPY mutants (Lys in the second position of the cleavage site) were the most potent inhibitors of pro-ACTH/endorphin cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1504857606,"Maple syrup urine disease in man and cattle is an inborn metabolic error caused by the deficiency of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase. We have studied the molecular basis of the disease in Polled Hereford calves. The E1 component of branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase was virtually undetectable by Western blot analysis of fibroblasts from an affected calf. Northern blot analysis failed to detect the E1 alpha mRNA species in the fibroblasts. Nevertheless, it was readily demonstrated by reverse transcription of RNA followed by polymerase chain reaction that the mRNA for the E1 alpha subunit was present in the cells, albeit at very low concentrations. Sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA for the entire coding region of the E1 alpha subunit revealed a single base substitution at codon -6 (CAG to TAG). This mutation introduces a stop codon in the leader peptide of the E1 alpha subunit, resulting in the premature termination of translation. The mutation was verified by hybridization of the amplified cDNA fragments from two affected calves with allele-specific oligonucleotides. This finding explains the pathogenesis of maple syrup urine disease in this breed of cattle, which provides the only known animal model for the human disease. In addition, the results provide evidence for the effect of premature translation termination on reducing the steady-state mRNA level and the dependence of E1 beta protein stability on the co-expression of the E1 alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1642975835,"A combined approach of cDNA cloning and direct oligonucleotide mapping of TGF-beta 1 mRNA from several human cell lines has revealed that the major human TGF-beta 1 transcript is 381 bases shorter than originally reported, and that the reduced mRNA size is due to polyadenylation from an ATTAAA signal at position 2136 rather than use of the expected AATAAA signal at position 2517. Moreover, there is no evidence for a significant amount of structural heterogeneity, as a result of alternative polyadenylation, in the human TGF-beta 1 transcripts. Considering that the 381-base domain is not part of the major human TGF-beta 1 mRNA, we analyzed this sequence for potential transcriptional regulatory elements. We have identified a 16-base pair domain which contains three putative phorbol ester responsive elements (TREs) based on homology to the TRE consensus sequence. We also show that this 16-base pair fragment confers phorbol ester responsiveness to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene after transient transfection of the heterologous construct in NIH-3T3 cells. The identification of a TRE immediately downstream of the last TGF-beta 1 exon suggests that a 3' enhancer may play an important role in human TGF-beta 1 gene transcription, and suggests a basis for growth factor-mediated regulation of TGF-beta 1 expression by activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1670501090,"Thrombospondin is a multifunctional adhesive glycoprotein which binds to the surface of resting and activated platelets. Thrombospondin also binds to a variety of proteins, including fibrinogen. The interactions between platelet-bound thrombospondin and fibrinogen are thought to facilitate irreversible platelet aggregation. Both the A alpha- and B beta-chains of fibrinogen specifically bind to thrombospondin. Cyanogen bromide cleavage products of the fibrinogen A alpha- and B beta-chains, and synthetic peptides corresponding to specific regions of these cleavage products were utilized to identify the regions of the fibrinogen A alpha- and B beta-chains which bind to thrombospondin. Cyanogen bromide fragments of the A alpha- and B beta-fibrinogen chains, resolved by gel filtration and reversed-phase chromatography, were examined for thrombospondin binding activity. Thrombospondin specifically bound to the A alpha-chain fragment encompassing residues 92-147 and the B beta-chain fragment encompassing residues 243-305. Analyses of the binding characteristics of two series of overlapping synthetic peptides revealed that peptides corresponding to residues 113-126 of the A alpha-chain and residues 243-252 of the B beta-chain retained thrombospondin binding activity. Separate bovine serum albumin conjugates of the active A alpha-chain and B beta-chain peptides inhibited platelet aggregation. These studies reveal that fibrinogen possesses at least two unique sequences which are recognized by thrombospondin and that such interaction may affect platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1553811429,"Cells of the J774 mouse macrophage-like cell line possess organic anion transporter that transport fluorescent dyes such as Lucifer Yellow out of the cytoplasmic matrix of the cells; the dye is both sequestered in endosomes and secreted into the extracellular medium. Lucifer Yellow that is sequestered within endosomes is subsequently delivered to the lysosomal compartment. In the present studies we demonstrated that probenecid inhibited removal of Lucifer Yellow from the soluble cytoplasm and sequestration into membrane bound organelles by quantitating Lucifer Yellow fluorescence in both soluble and membrane-associated fractions of J774 cells. In addition, we examined the uptake of Lucifer Yellow into isolated subcellular organelles derived from J774 cells. Lucifer Yellow transport in the organellar fraction of J774 cell homogenates was temperature- and pH-dependent and did not require ATP. Subcellular organelles from J774 cells were fractionated into endosome- and lysosome-enriched fractions by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Lucifer Yellow was preferentially taken up by vesicles of the endosome-enriched fraction, and this transport was inhibited by probenecid. These studies provide direct evidence that probenecid inhibits Lucifer Yellow transport out of the cytoplasmic matrix and into cytoplasmic vacuoles in J774 cells and that organic anion transport in isolated organelles derived from J774 cells occurs preferentially in endosome, rather than in lysosome-enriched fractions; they suggest that Lucifer Yellow is carried across membranes via a secondary active transport process that requires proton symptom or hydroxyl anion antiport."
https://openalex.org/W1486466189,"Recently, we proved the existence of the second calmodulin family protein in Tetrahymena (Tetrahymena calcium-binding protein of 25 kDa, TCBP-25) by analyzing its cDNA (Takemasa, T., Ohnishi, K., Kobayashi, T., Takagi, T., Konishi, K., and Watanabe, Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19293-19301). During the amino acid sequence determination of TCBP-25, we became aware of the fact that another polypeptide carrying calcium-binding domains of EF-hand type existed in addition to Tetrahymena calmodulin and TCBP-25. This third calmodulin family protein from Tetrahymena was confirmed by isolating its cDNA clones. One of the cloned cDNAs contains 763 nucleotides and encodes a protein that is composed of 207 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 23,413 daltons. This predicted protein possesses four EF-hand type calcium-binding domains, so we have designated it as Tetrahymena calcium-binding protein of 23 kDa (TCBP-23). TCBP-23 is similar (35% homology) but clearly different from TCBP-25. The TCBP-23 gene is actively transcribed in vivo as a 0.84-kilobase RNA. Thus, it follows that Tetrahymena cells have three different calmodulin family proteins: calmodulin, TCBP-25 and TCBP-23. These proteins are expected to provide important clues for solving the mechanisms of calcium-dependent phenomena, such as ciliary reversal."
https://openalex.org/W1538168419,"Phospholipase A2 enzymatic activity was measured in the teratoma-derived adipogenic cell line 1246 and in adipocyte precursors in primary cultures. It was shown that enzymatic activity was low while the cells were undifferentiated and increased by 20-24-fold after the cells had undergone adipocyte differentiation. The increase of phospholipase A2 activity follows the same time course as that observed for glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity used as a marker of differentiation. In contrast, the differentiation-deficient, insulin-independent cell line 1246-3A always contained very low levels of phospholipase A2 activity. Phospholipase A2 activity measured in the 1246 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by incubation with ONO-RS-082 and quinacrine which are inhibitors of phospholipase A2 activity. Measurements of arachidonate metabolites in 1246 cells showed that production of prostaglandin F2 alpha by the 1246 cells followed the same time course as the increase of phospholipase A2 activity during differentiation. Similar results were obtained with primary cultures of adipocyte precursors. These results indicate that phospholipase A2 is a differentiation-dependent enzymatic activity for the adipogenic cell line 1246 and for adipocyte precursors in primary culture. These data suggest that metabolic pathways controlled by phospholipase A2 activity could play an important physiological role in adipose tissue differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1495601921,"To examine the role of the 5.8 S rRNA in ribosome function, oligodeoxyribonucleotides, complementary to chemically accessible sequences, were incubated with rabbit reticulocyte or wheat germ extracts undergoing protein synthesis in vitro. Significant and reproducible inhibitions were observed with several different oligonucleotides, the most inhibitory being specific for the universally conserved GAAC sequence. Mutant or heterologous sequences were substantially less inhibitory, results which clearly implicate the 5.8 S rRNA in the inhibitory process and are consistent with the possibility that the 5.8 S rRNA plays an important role in the binding of tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1576358597,"Neuronal glycoproteins derived from growth cones are enriched in protein tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast, glycoproteins obtained from mature synaptosomes are relatively lacking in this activity. At least three types of protein tyrosine kinases were detected in association with growth cone glycoproteins: 1) a Mn2(+)-dependent activity which phosphorylates several endogenous substrates; 2) a Mn2+/Mg2(+)-dependent activity which phosphorylates synthetic substrate and is stimulated by acidic brain extracts; and 3) protein tyrosine kinases corresponding to the insulin and insulin-like growth factor I receptors. These enzymes may be particularly important during earlier stages of neuronal maturation."
