https://openalex.org/W1564079839,"When lipoprotein [a] was isolated in the presence of the proteolytic inhibitor Trasylol, its apoprotein exhibited one dominant band corresponding to a molecular weight of about 1.2 million when analyzed by electrophoresis on 3.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. After chemical reduction, this band was missing but was replaced by two bands, one corresponding to a molecular weight of about 490,000 and the other to a molecular weight of about 645,000. Before treatment with reducing agents, the apolipoprotein [a] and apolipoprotein B immunoreactivities were detectable in the same electrophoretic band, but after reduction the apolipoprotein [a] was demonstrated to be separate from the apolipoprotein B. These results suggest that the apoprotein of lipoprotein [a] is composed of two subunits which are similar in molecular weight and are held together by one or more disulfide bonds. One subunit possesses apolipoprotein [a] and the other apolipoprotein B immunoreactivity. The secondary structure of the apoprotein components within lipoprotein [a] has been studied by circular dichroism and found to differ significantly from the secondary structure of the apoproteins in low density lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins. About 30% alpha-helical structure was measured in lipoprotein [a] compared to 48% in low density lipoproteins and 70% in high density lipoproteins. Lipoprotein [a] exhibited a much higher percentage of disordered structure than either of the other two lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2062606014,"After transport in the blood and implantation in the microcirculation, metastatic tumor cells must invade the vascular endothelium and underlying basal lamina. Mouse B16 melanoma sublines were used to determine the relation between metastatic properties and the ability of the sublines to degrade enzymatically the sulfated glycosaminoglycans present in the extracellular matrix of cultured vascular endothelial cells. Highly invasive and metastatic B16 sublines degraded matrix glycosaminoglycans faster than did sublines of lower metastatic potential. The main products of this matrix degradation were heparan sulfate fragments. Intact B16 cells (or their cell-free homogenates) with a high potential for lung colonization degraded purified heparan sulfate from bovine lung at higher rates than did B16 cells with a poor potential for lung colonization. Analysis of the degradation fragments indicated that B16 cells have a heparan sulfate endoglycosidase. Thus the abilities of B16 melanoma cells to extravasate and successfully colonize the lung may be related to their capacities to degrade heparan sulfate in the walls of pulmonary blood vessels."
https://openalex.org/W1988309865,"Bacteriophage P1 encodes its own site-specific recombination system consisting of a site at which recombination takes place called loxP and a recombinase called Cre. A number of lambda and plasmid substrates containing two loxP sites have been constructed. Using these substrates we have shown both in vivo and in vitro that a fully functional loxP site is composed of no more than 60 bp. In vitro, when an extract containing Cre is used, recombination between loxP sites on supercoiled, nicked-circle or linear DNA occurs efficiently. The most surprising result from the in vitro studies is that 50% of the products of recombination between loxP sites on a supercoiled DNA substrate are present as free supercoiled circles. The ability to produce free products starting with a supercoiled substrate suggests a rather unique property of Cre-mediated lox recombination, the implications of which are discussed in terms of possible effects of the protein on the topology of the DNA molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1546132586,"Platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa exists as a calcium-dependent complex of two large peptides (designated IIb and IIIa) in Triton X-100 solutions, but it remains unknown if these peptides are subunits of one glycoprotein or are actually two individual glycoproteins in the intact platelet membrane. We used crossed immunoelectrophoresis to define the epitopes of two monoclonal antibodies to IIb-IIIa, then used these antibodies to study the structural and functional organization of IIb and IIIa in the platelet membrane. Human platelets solubilized in Triton X-100 were electrophoresed through an intermediate gel containing 125I-monoclonal IgG, then into an upper gel containing rabbit anti-human platelet antibodies. Our previously characterized antibody. Tab, and a new monoclonal antibody, T10, both bound to the immunoprecipitate corresponding to the IIb-IIIa complex. When platelets were electrophoresed after solubilization in 5 mM EDTA, 125I-Tab bound to the dissociated IIb polypeptide, but not to IIIa. In contrast, 125-I-T10 did not react with either IIb or IIIa. Thus, Tab recognizes a determinant on IIb, while T10 recognizes a determinant created only after the association of IIb and IIIa. Gel-filtered platelets from six normal donors bound 50,600 +/- 5,600 125I-T10 molecules/platelet and 47,800 +/- 11,200 125I-Tab molecules/platelet, consistent with IIb-IIIa being a heterodimer. 125I-T10 binding was identical in unactivated platelets and platelets stimulated with 10 microM ADP. However, platelets did not aggregate or bind 125I-fibrinogen until ADP was added. T10, but not Tab or nonimmune mouse antibody, inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation and 125I-fibrinogen binding. Our findings suggest that IIb and IIIa exist as subunits of a single membrane glycoprotein in unstimulated platelets. Fibrinogen binding appears to require not only the interaction of IIb and IIIa, but also some additional change occurring after platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W1587051516,"Monoclonal antibodies allow for the detection of antigens which are specific for human thymus-derived lymphocytes. Among these antigens, the T3 complex is of particular interest since it is involved in several T cell functions. The main target antigen of the anti-T3 reagents is borne by a 20-kDa glycoprotein. In addition, glycoproteins of 25-28, 37, and 44 kDa are found in anti-T3 immunoprecipitates derived from surface-labeled cells. The four antigens appeared to be strongly associated with each other in detergent-containing solutions. Comparative studies of the four proteins, facilitated by the use of endo-beta-N-acetylglycosaminidase F, revealed that their polypeptide backbones have different molecular weights and pI values. Moreover, peptide maps of the 20-kDa T3 and the 25-28-kDa T3 were quite different. Metabolic labeling experiments suggested that the 25-28-kDa protein might become associated with the 20-kDa T3 antigen during biosynthesis. The 37-kDa and 44-kDa proteins could not, however, be detected and, therefore, might become associated with the 20-kDa T3 on the cell surface. Evidence has been found for the existence of a fifth member of the T3 complex, namely an unglycosylated 20-kDa T3 species."
https://openalex.org/W1488453532,"Mitochondria of sperm of the sea urchin Strongylo-centrotus purpuratus are tightly coupled before induction of the acrosomal reaction. When the sperm are diluted at low external pH (pH 5.5) or in high potassium (200 mM) or in the absence of sodium, their internal pH is acidic (6.2-7.0) as measured by amine accumulation. Under these conditions the internal ATPase activity (primarily the dynein ATPase) is inhibited, sperm are immotile, and mitochondria are in respiratory state 4 (ATP concentration is maximal). When the internal pH is alkalinized, the internal ATPase activity is increased, as estimated either in vivo by measuring the decrease in ATP concentration after addition of oligomycin to prevent ATP synthesis, or in vitro using Triton X-100 permeabilized cells. This increase in ATPase activity correlates with an increase of up to 50-fold in respiratory rates and a mitochondrial transition to state 3. Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-uncoupled respiration is also sensitive to the internal pH for it is inhibited at acidic internal pH. However, since nonmotile, nonrespiring sperm that are obtained when the internal pH is acidic have high concentrations of ATP, we conclude that in vivo the internal pH controls the rate of dynein ATPase and that this ATPase activity is limiting for the respiration of tightly coupled mitochondria. The redox state of the respiratory chain may also be under the direct influence of the internal pH."
https://openalex.org/W1482931197,"Hen oviduct membranes have been shown to catalyze the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAc-beta 1-2Man alpha 1-6(GlcNAc beta 1-2 Man alpha 1-3) Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc-Asn-X (GnGn) to form the triantennary structure GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-6[GlcNAc beta 1-2(GlcNAc beta 1-4)Man alpha 1-3]Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc-Asn-X. The enzyme has been named UDP-GlcNAc:GnGn (GlcNAc to Man alpha 1-3) beta 4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV (GlcNAc-transferase IV) to distinguish it from three other hen oviduct GlcNAc-transferases designated I, II, and III. Since GlcNAc-transferases III and IV both act on the same substrate, concanavalin A/Sepharose was used to separate the products of the two enzymes. At pH 7.0 and at a Triton X-100 concentration of 0.125% (v/v), GlcNAc-transferase IV activity in hen oviduct membranes is 7 nmol/mg of protein/h. The product was characterized by high resolution proton NMR spectroscopy at 360 MHz and by methylation analysis. In addition to triantennary oligosaccharide, hen oviduct membranes produced about 20% of bisected triantennary material, GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-6[GlcNAc beta 1-2(GlcNAc beta 1-4)Man alpha 1-3] [GlcNAc beta 1-4]Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc-Asn-X. Maximal GlcNAc-transferase IV activity requires the presence of both terminal beta 1-2-linked GlcNAc residues in the substrate. Removal of the GlcNAc residue on the Man alpha 1-6 arm or of both GlcNAc residues reduces activity by at least 80%. A Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc disaccharide on the Man alpha 1-6 arm reduces activity by 68% while the presence of this disaccharide on the Man alpha 1-3 arm reduces activity to negligible levels. A similar substrate specificity was found for GlcNAc-transferase III, the enzyme which adds a bisecting GlcNAc in beta 1-4 linkage to the beta-linked Man residue. Since a bisecting GlcNAc was found to prevent GlcNAc-transferase IV action, the bisected triantennary material found in the incubation must have been formed by the sequential action of GlcNAc-transferase IV followed by GlcNAc-transferase III. Activities similar to GlcNAc-transferase IV were also detected in rat liver Golgi-rich membranes (0.4 nmol/mg/h) and pig thyroid microsomes (0.1 nmol/mg/h)."
https://openalex.org/W1561426422,"Dynein was obtained by high salt extraction of Tetrahymena cilia and purified by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. This fraction consisted of a mixture of 30 S dynein (80%) and the 14 S ATPase (15%). The column purification effectively removed tubulin and adenylate kinase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis indicated that the 30 S dynein was composed of a major heavy chain (approximately 400 kD, three copies), three intermediate chains (70, 85, and 100 kD), and a group of light chains (approximately 20 kD). The binding of the column-purified dynein to bovine brain microtubules was characterized as follows. (i) Titration of the dynein with microtubules showed a linear increase in turbidity up to an equivalence point of 2.7 mg of dynein/mg of tubulin with apparently tight binding; (ii) the addition of ATP caused the turbidity of the solution of decrease to a level equal to the sum of free dynein plus microtubules; (iii) transmission electron microscopy indicated that microtubules were decorated with dynein arms spaced at a 24-nm longitudinal repeat and that the dynein decoration was removed upon addition of ATP; (iv) cross-section images of microtubules that were saturated with dynein showed six to seven dynein arms around a microtubule consisting of 14 protofilaments, corresponding to a molar ratio of one dynein/six tubulin dimers; (v) the dynein arms were bound primarily by their broader end which corresponds to the end normally bound to the B-subfiber in vivo. Experiments with purified 30 and 14 S dyneins indicated that the dynein-microtubule binding activity and the ATP-induced dissociation were the properties of the 30 S dynein alone. These studies demonstrate that the 30 S dynein under our conditions (50 mM PIPES, pH 6.96, 4 mM MgSO4) interacts with bovine brain microtubules through the ATP-sensitive site of the dynein arm."
https://openalex.org/W2079707727,"The synthesis and assembly of spectrin was investigated in erythroid cells during chicken embryo development. Immunoprecipitation of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble cytoskeletal fractions with α- and β-spectrin antisera show that, at steady state, α and β spectrin are present in stoichiometric amounts, and exclusively, in the cytoskeleton. However, pulse labeling of cells and in vitro translation of total erythroid cell RNA reveal that α spectrin is synthesized in a two to three fold excess over β spectrin. Pulse-chase experiments show that newly synthesized α and β spectrin are present in both the cytoskeletal and soluble fractions, and that stoichiometric amounts are stably assembled in the cytoskeleton. On the other hand, there is a severalfold excess of α relative to β spectrin in the soluble fraction, both of which turn over with a half-life of 50 min. In cells from 4 day old embryos, more than 80% of the newly synthesized β spectrin, but only 10% of the α spectrin, are present in the cytoskeleton. Thus, early in development, the association of α and β spectrin with the membrane-cytoskeleton may be rate-limited by the amount of β spectrin synthesized. Later on in erythroid development, progressively lesser proportions of newly synthesized β spectrin are present in the cytoskeleton, suggesting that during development, the rate of association of β spectrin with the membrane-cytoskeleton becomes limited by some other membrane-cytoskeletal component."
https://openalex.org/W1506235751,"The hydrophobic weak acid, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), induced rapid swelling of mitochondria suspended in NH4SCN, as predicted from the protonophoretic property of CCCP. Butacaine and other hydrophobic amines produced the same response as CCCP. As expected of a protonophore, CCCP (a) induced swelling in mitochondria suspended in potassium acetate and valinomycin, (b) induced rapid K+ efflux from mitochondria treated with valinomycin, and (c) caused an 8-fold stimulation of respiration. Butacaine alone was unable to mimic these effects of CCCP; however, all of these effects were observed with butacaine when SCN- or tetraphenylboron were added to the assay medium. We conclude that amine local anesthetics are not protonophores; rather, their uncoupler-like activity derives from their ability to form lipophilic ion pairs with certain anions. Depending on conditions, ion pair transport may result in electroneutral anion uptake or in electrophoretic proton transport. Uncoupling results from transmembrane cycling of neutral amine, charged anion, and neutral ion pair. Dose response studies were carried out for several pharmacologically important amines with local anesthetic properties. Their relative potencies in the NH4SCN swelling assay followed the order: chlorpromazine much greater than quinine greater than dibucaine greater than quinidine greater than butacaine greater than propranolol greater than tetracaine much greater than lidocaine, procaine, procainamide. Neutral anesthetics (progesterone and benzocaine) and an amine with low anesthetic potency (timolol) were found ineffective. Among hydrophobic drugs, swelling rates in NH4SCN correlate poorly with octanol:water partition coefficients, suggesting that the rate of ion pair transport is determined by the formation constant for lipophilic ion pairs."
https://openalex.org/W1493463750,"At pH 7 and 20 degrees C and in the absence of potassium and magnesium, the intrinsic fluorescence rise after addition of calcium to a calcium-deprived enzyme was monoexponential. On the other hand, when the calcium-deprived enzyme was preincubated with magnesium, this fluorescence rise was clearly biphasic at high calcium concentrations. For a constant magnesium concentration (higher than millimolar), the rate constant of the slow phase and the amplitude of the fast phase rose for the same range of calcium concentrations, between pCa 5 and 4. At pH 6, fluorescence signals were monophasic even with 20 mM Mg2+. We also found that at pH 7, phosphorylation of the enzyme after simultaneous addition of calcium, magnesium, and ATP was faster when sarcoplasmic reticulum was originally calcium-deprived in the presence of magnesium. At pH 6, on the contrary, preincubation with magnesium did not influence the phosphorylation time course. It is concluded that (a) magnesium produces an enzyme conformation which is able to react with calcium and ATP as required by the kinetics of the ATPase reaction; (b) the magnesium-enzyme complex presents one readily accessible site of relatively low affinity (Kd congruent to 25 microM) for calcium; (c) occupancy of this site by calcium triggers a relatively slow (4-6 s-1) conformational change unmasking a second high affinity site; (d) interaction between and occupancy of these two calcium sites occur with positive cooperativity and yield enzyme activation; and (e) the kinetic difference between the low time constant of the second component of fluorescence rise following addition of calcium (in the absence of ATP) and the relatively fast phosphorylation obtained in the same conditions (but in the presence of ATP) is attributed to an Mg2+-dependent accelerating effect of ATP on enzyme isomerization."
https://openalex.org/W1731043479,"Abstract The mitochondrial F1-ATPase from bean (Vicia faba L.) was solubilized by a chloroform treatment of mitochondrial membranes and purified by centrifugation on a glycerol gradient. The active fraction contained 5 subunits: alpha (Mr = 52,000), beta (Mr = 51,000), gamma (Mr = 34,000), delta (Mr = 23,800), and epsilon (Mr = 22,900). Purified coupled mitochondria were incubated in the presence of [ 35S ]methionine and malate to allow mitochondrial translation to occur. The largest labeled polypeptide (Mr = 52,000) was present in the chloroform extract, co-sedimented with the F1-ATPase on glycerol gradient and co-migrated with the alpha subunit upon two-dimensional electrophoresis. The results indicate that the alpha subunit of bean mitochondrial ATPase is translated on mitoribosomes, in contrast to the situation in other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1549741713,"Structural analyses were performed on the intact glycopeptides and on the linkage region oligosaccharide-peptides derived from the keratan sulfate proteoglycan from monkey cornea (Nakazawa, K., Newsome, D.A., Nilsson, B., Hascall, V.C., and Hassell, J.R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6051-6055) using trifluoroacetolysis, Smith degradation, chromium trioxide oxidation, and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The following structure was found for the linkage region (formula; see text) The following structures were found for the intact oligosaccharide peptides (formula; see text) and (formula; see text) The structure of the linkage region for keratan sulfate on corneal proteoglycans is clearly derived from a complex type of N-linked glycoprotein oligosaccharide precursor, indicating that only the oligosaccharides that have been processed to the complex type are used as primers for synthesizing keratan sulfate chains. The high mannose oligosaccharide in Formula 3 is an intermediate in the normal pathway for biosynthesis of complex type oligosaccharides. The structure in Formula 2, in which a single Man alpha 1-2 is retained on the Man alpha 1-3 branch while the Man alpha 1-6 branch is unsubstituted, can be an intermediate for an alternate, presumably minor pathway for complex oligosaccharide formation (Kornfeld, S., Gregory, W., and Chapman, A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11649-11654) in certain cases. This structure has not previously been shown to be present on normal glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1544693018,"A procedure has been developed for the effective solubilization of UDP-glucose:1,4-beta-D-glucan 4-beta-D-glucosyltransferase (cellulose synthase) by treatment of membranes from the bacterium Acetobacter xylinum with digitonin. Low concentrations of digitonin (0.1%, w/v) cause stimulation of the enzyme activity in membranes; treatment with higher concentrations of digitonin (1-10%) results in solubilization of up to 70% of the digitonin-stimulated activity. The digitonin-solubilized enzyme displays regulatory properties quite similar to those of the membrane-bound form of the enzyme, showing specific activation by GTP. GTP activation requires the presence of a protein factor which can be separated from the enzyme by washing the membranes prior to enzyme solubilization. Association of this protein factor with the membrane-bound enzyme is promoted by polyethylene glycol or by Ca2+; however, these compounds are ineffective in enhancing enzyme-factor association for the enzyme in the solubilized state. The observation that Ca2+ promotes enzyme-factor association in the membranes suggests that this cation, in addition to GTP, may play a role in the regulation of cellulose synthesis in vivo in A. xylinum."
https://openalex.org/W1588284427,"The Ca2+-pumping ATPase has been isolated from calf heart sarcolemma by calmodulin affinity chromatography (Caroni, P., and Carafoli, E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3263-3270) as a polypeptide of Mr about 140,000. The purified enzyme has high affinity for Ca2+ in the presence of calmodulin (Km about 0.4 microM) but shifts to a low affinity state (Km about 20 microM) in its absence. Calmodulin increases also the Vmax of the enzyme. The effects of calmodulin are mimicked by phosphatidylserine and by a limited proteolytic treatment of the enzyme with trypsin. The purified ATPase can be reconstituted in asolectin liposomes, where it pumps Ca2+ with an approximate stoichiometry to ATP of 1. The purified (and reconstituted) enzyme is not phosphorylated by added ATP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase under conditions where the enzyme in situ is stimulated concomitant with the phosphorylation of the sarcolemmal membrane (Caroni, P., and Carafoli, E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 9371-9373). Hence, the target of the regulatory phosphorylation system is not the ATPase molecule. The purified ATPase cross-reacts with an antibody raised against the erythrocyte Ca2+-pumping ATPase. Under the same conditions, the purified sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase does not react. The proteolytic splitting pattern of the purified heart sarcolemma and erythrocyte enzymes are similar but not identical."
https://openalex.org/W1526656863,"recA protein and circular single-stranded DNA form a stable complex in the presence of single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), in which one recA protein monomer is bound per two nucleotides of DNA. These complexes are kinetically significant intermediates in the exchange of strands between the single-stranded DNA and an homologous linear duplex. After completion of strand exchange, the recA protein remains tightly associated with the circular duplex product of the reaction and the SSB is bound to the displaced linear single strand. Upon addition of ADP, the recA protein-duplex DNA complex dissociates. RecA protein also interacts with single-stranded DNA in the absence of SSB; however, the amount of recA protein bound is substantially reduced. These findings provide direct physical evidence for the participation of SSB in the formation of the recA protein-single-stranded DNA complexes inferred earlier from kinetic analysis. Moreover, they confirm the ability of recA protein to equilibrate between bound and free forms in the absence of SSB."

https://openalex.org/W1536680810,"Acanthamoeba myosin II has three phosphorylation sites clustered near the end of the tail of each of its two heavy chains (six phosphorylation sites/molecule). Myosin II has little or no actin-activated ATPase activity when four to six of these sites are phosphorylated. Maximal actin-activated ATPase activity is obtained when all six sites are dephosphorylated. Under assay conditions, both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated myosin II form bipolar filaments. Filaments of dephosphorylated myosin II have larger sedimentation coefficients than filaments of phosphorylated myosin II but this difference does not explain the difference in their actin-activated ATPase activities. Heteropolymers, formed by mixing soluble dephosphorylated and phosphorylated myosins and then diluting the mixture into low ionic strength buffer containing MgCl2, have sedimentation coefficients close to those of the homopolymer of phosphorylated myosin. The actin-activated ATPase activities of heteropolymers are, under most conditions, lower than the equivalent mixtures of homopolymers of dephosphorylated and phosphorylated myosins. It is concluded, therefore, that the phosphorylation of myosin tails regulates the actin-activated ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin II by affecting the myosin filament as a whole rather than specifically affecting the heads of the phosphorylated myosin molecules only."
https://openalex.org/W1533237727,"A partially purified preparation of the plant plasma membrane ATPase was phosphorylated when incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP. The phosphoprotein formed has the characteristics of an enzyme intermediate because of its rapidity of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The sensitivity of the phosphoenzyme bond to alkaline pH and to hydroxylamine indicates that it is an acylphosphate. Both the ATPase activity and the phosphorylation of the enzyme exhibited an apparent Km value of 0.3 mM ATP. When the phosphorylated enzyme was analyzed by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, only one major band with a molecular weight of about 105,000 contained radioactivity. These results indicate that the plant plasma membrane ATPase has a subunit composition and reaction mechanism similar to the cation-pumping ATPases of animal and fungal plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W98159964,"A line of human lymphocytic leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM) has been obtained which is 140-fold resistant to the potent cell growth inhibitor 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd). The cells were also 11-fold cross-resistant to 5-fluorouracil. In contrast to several previous studies involving FdUrd-resistant mouse cells, thymidylate synthetase levels were not substantially elevated in these FdUrd-resistant human leukemic cells. Thymidine kinase activity was also unchanged in the resistant cells, although the levels of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate (FdUMP), the potent inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase, generated at equimolar doses of FdUrd were about 40% lower than in the sensitive cells. Studies of the kinetics of FdUMP binding to thymidylate synthetase isolated from the FdUrd-resistant cells disclosed a considerably higher dissociation constant (Kd = 1.0 X 10(-9) M) for the ternary covalent enzyme . FdUMP . 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate complex compared to the value obtained with enzyme from sensitive cells (Kd = 4.4 X 10(-11) M). The thymidylate synthetase from the FdUrd-resistant cells also showed 17-fold weaker binding of 2'-deoxyuridylate, even though the Km value for 2'-deoxyuridylate was 3-fold lower compared to the enzyme from FdUrd-sensitive cells. The turnover number of the altered enzyme was 1.8-fold higher than that for the normal enzyme but the rate constants for the release of FdUMP from the ternary complex, which is also an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, were identical for both enzymes. Electrophoresis of the radiolabeled ternary complexes on nondenaturing gels showed small but reproducible differences in migration rates. These results demonstrate that the mechanism of resistance to FdUrd in this cell line involves an alteration in the target enzyme, thymidylate synthetase, which causes it have a lower affinity for nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1530933431,"The conformational basis for the loss of C3b functional site expression following its conversion to iC3b by the regulatory proteins factor H and factor I has been examined by a number of spectroscopic techniques including the fluorescence of the extrinsic probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate, circular dichroism, and UV absorption difference spectroscopy. These techniques all detected significant conformational alterations accompanying the proteolytic cleavage event. To a substantial extent, the observed spectral changes tended to reverse those seen in the original conversion of native C3 to its functionally active C3b form. Similar changes were also seen when the thioester-cleaved, but peptide chain-intact, form of C3 was acted upon by the regulatory proteins. The most dramatic effect was seen in the 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate fluorescence system where the fluorescence enhancement observed upon conversion of C3 to C3b, which presumably reflects an increase in surface hydrophobicity, is lost upon further cleavage of the molecule to iC3b. This marked signal change forms the basis of a simple spectrofluorometric assay with which to study the enzymatic properties of factor I for its true substrate: the complex formed between C3b and factor H. Using this assay, factor I was found to display very tight binding of its substance, the Km at 25 degrees C being on the order of 0.025-0.1 microM, but it was also found to show a low rate of cleavage, the turnover number being less than 10 min-1 at this temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1519213724,"Low phosphate and high phosphate forms of phosphofructokinase (Furuya, E., and Uyeda, K. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11656-11659) from rat liver were purified to homogeneity and various properties were compared. The specific activities of these enzymes and their electrophoretic mobilities on polyacrylamide in sodium dodecyl sulfate are the same. A limited tryptic digestion yields products with no change in the enzyme activity but with a reduction in the molecular weight of about 2000. Both low and high phosphate enzymes can be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and approximately twice as much [32P]phosphate is incorporated into the low phosphate than the high phosphate enzyme. A comparison of their allosteric kinetic properties reveal that the high phosphate enzyme is much more sensitive to inhibition by ATP and citrate and shows a higher K0.5 for fructose 6-phosphate than the low phosphate enzyme, and the difference in the K0.5 values becomes greater at lower pH values. Furthermore, the high phosphate phosphofructokinase is less sensitive to activation by AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Moreover, when the low phosphate enzyme is phosphorylated by protein kinase, the resulting phosphorylated enzyme exhibits a higher K0.5 for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate than does the untreated enzyme. These results demonstrate that the phosphorylation affects the allosteric kinetic properties of the enzyme and results in a less active form of phosphofructokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1479999735,"The interactions of Tb3+ and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) were investigated by inhibition of Ca2+-activated ATPase activity and enhancement of Tb3+ fluorescence. Ca2+ protected against Tb3+ inhibition of SR ATPase activity. The apparent association constant for Ca2+, determined from the protection, was about 6 x 10(6) M-1, suggesting that Tb3+ inhibits the ATPase activity by binding to the high affinity Ca2+ binding sites. Mg2+ did not protect in the 2-20 mM range. The association constant for Tb3+ binding to this Ca2+ site was estimated to be about 1 x 10(9) M-1. No cooperativity was observed for Tb3+ binding. No enhancement of Tb3+ fluorescence was detected. A second group of binding sites, with weaker affinity for Tb3+, was observed by monitoring the enhancement of Tb3+ fluorescence (lambda ex 285 nm, lambda em 545 nm). The fluorescence intensity increased 950-fold due to binding. Ca2+ did not complete for binding at these sites, but Mg2+ did. The association constant for Mg2+ binding was 94 M-1, suggesting that this may be the site that catalyzes phosphorylation of the ATPase by inorganic phosphate. For vesicles, Tb3+ binding to these Mg2+ sites was best described as binding to two classes of binding sites with negative cooperativity. If the SR ATPase was solubilized in the nonionic detergent C12E9 (dodecyl nonaoxyethylene ether alcohol), in the absence of Ca2+, only one class of Tb3+ binding sites was observed. The total number of sites appeared to remain constant. If Ca2+ was included in the solubilization step, Tb3+ binding to these Mg2+ binding sites displayed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient, 2.1). In all cases, the apparent association constant for Tb3+, in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2, was in the range of 1-5 x 10(4) M-1."
https://openalex.org/W201899562,The pattern and sites of phosphorylation of high mobility group (HMG) chromosomal proteins in HeLa cells labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate have been compared with those of isolated HeLa HMG protein labeled in vitro by purified protein kinase enzymes. In synchronized HeLa cells there is phosphorylation of two HMG proteins designated hHMG 14 alpha 1 and alpha 2. hHMG 14 alpha 1 and alpha 2 are phosphorylated in a single identical tryptic phosphopeptide which runs toward the anode with electrophoresis at pH 4.7. The specific activity of phosphorylation at this site increased 2.5-fold in both hHMG 14 alpha 1 and alpha 2 in metaphase compared to interphase cultures. In vitro only casein kinase II specifically catalyzed phosphorylation of hHMG 14 alpha 1 and alpha 2 among a mixture of hHMG proteins; phosphorylation occurred at the site which was phosphorylated in vivo. The site of phosphorylation catalyzed by casein kinase II is distinct from sites in HMG proteins phosphorylated by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases or by casein kinase I. Casein kinase I specifically catalyzed phosphorylation of histone H1. These results indicate that casein kinase II is the enzyme which catalyzes the major phosphorylation of hHMG protein which occurs in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W1567144560,"The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are multivalent cations that bind to anionic cell constituents such as nucleic acids. Their distribution between free and bound states within the cell is not known. Such knowledge would be important in relation to the negative control of polyamine synthesis. We report a tracer experiment in which [14C]ornithine was added to logarithmically growing Neurospora crassa mycelia. The amount and the specific radioactivity of the three polyamines thereafter suggested that new molecules of spermidine were made preferentially from new molecules of putrescine, and that new molecules of spermine were made from new molecules of spermidine. The extent of mixing of new [14C]- and resident [12C]spermidine indicated that 70% or more of the resident spermidine was sequestered, and not immediately accessible to spermine synthase. Cell fractionation revealed that about 28% of the cellular spermidine was vacuolar, and nonexchangeable with [14C] spermidine added at the time of cell breakage. We suggest that the remainder of sequestered spermidine is bound strongly to anionic sites in the cell, and is relatively inactive in the control and synthesis of polyamines."
https://openalex.org/W2094092091,Certain human glioma lines produce mucopolysaccharide coats that impair the generation of cytolytic lymphocytes in response to these lines in vitro. Coat production is substantially enhanced by the interaction of glioma cells with a macromolecular factor released by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in culture. This interaction thus constitutes an unusual mechanism by which inflammatory cells may nonspecifically suppress the cellular immune response to at least one class of solid tumors in humans.
https://openalex.org/W1595325355,"Photophosphorylating activity of chloroplasts rapidly prepared from preilluminated spinach leaves was higher than the activity of chlorplasts from leaves kept in the dark. Higher Vmax values were obtained with the former when either ADP or Pi concentrations were varied. The rate of decay of the in vivo light-activated Mg2+-ATPase was highly dependent on temperature, increasing with it. At 0 degree C it was stable for 40 min or more. The decay at 25 degrees C was prevented by 5 mM ATP or 50 mM dithioerythritol while ADP or Pi did not affect it. Gramicidin or iodosobenzoate induced a very rapid decay even at 0 degree C. Coupling factor 1 with a manifest and stable Ca2+-ATPase activity was solubilized from chloroplasts activated by light in vivo. Incubation of chloroplasts from preilluminated leaves with N-[3H]ethylmaleimide resulted in an inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity and in the incorporation of radioactivity into the gamma subunit of coupling factor 1 that was larger than that of chloroplasts from leaves kept in the dark. The results show that activation in vivo of the proton ATPase was manifested by higher phosphorylating and Mg2+-ATPase activities and requires both an electrochemical proton gradient and a redox change of at least one disulfide bond of its gamma subunit."

Only 1 of 18 strains of S. aureus that were not associated with toxic shock syndrome showed the presence of bacteriophage. A laboratory strain of S. aureus was lysogenized by bacteriophage from two of the toxic shock-associated strains. These results add support to the theory that lysogeny by one or more bacteriophage in certain strains of S. aureus may be responsible for the pathogenesis of toxic shock syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1579138669,"An explant culture of 15 cynomolgus monkey corneas was incubated with [35S]sulfate and [2-3H]mannose as labeling precursors. A 4 M guanidine HCl extract of the corneal stromas was prepared and combined with a 4 M guanidine HCl extract of stromas from 300 unlabeled corneas. The keratan sulfate proteoglycans in the combined extracts were purified by a combination of DEAE-cellulose chromatography, chondroitinase ABC digestion to remove chondroitin-dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, and elution from immobilized concanavalin A. The purified keratan sulfate proteoglycan was digested with papain and the digest was eluted on DEAE-Sephacel. The unbound fraction contained 59% of the 3H activity and consisted of intact oligosaccharide-peptides. The bound fraction, consisting of keratan sulfate chains linked to peptides, eluted during a linear 0-0.75 M NaCl gradient as a peak centered at approximately 0.6 M NaCl and contained 41% of the 3H and all of the 35S activity in the original proteoglycan. The chains were digested with endo-beta-galactosidase, and the digest was eluted on DEAE-Sephacel with a linear 0-0.75 M NaCl gradient. Most of the sulfated digestion fragments from the chains eluted as several distinct peaks during the gradient. All the 3H activity eluted in the unbound volume along with a small proportion of 35S activity. This unbound fraction was eluted on Bio-Gel P-10 to give a 3H peak (Kav = 0.46) well resolved from the remaining 35S activity which eluted near the total volume. This 3H peak contained the oligosaccharide-peptides derived from the linkage region between the keratan sulfate chains and the core protein. Structural analyses of the linkage region oligosaccharides and the intact oligosaccharides (Nilsson, B., Nakazawa, K., Hassell, J.R., Newsome, D.A., and Hascall, V.C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6056-6063) in combination with the 3H-labeling data suggest that the intact keratan sulfate proteoglycans contain an average of about one intact oligosaccharide per keratan sulfate linkage site."

The neutral beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase was purified to homogeneity at 2000-2500-fold purification over the post-concanavalin A fraction. It was specific to beta-N-acetylgalactosaminide and was inactive to glucosaminide. It appeared to possess extremely small but detectable activity to hydrolyze the terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue from GM2, asialo-GM2, and globoside. The other enzyme, neutral N-acetylglucosaminidase, was 85-90% pure, judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was predominantly active toward the N-acetylglucosaminide substrate but hydrolyzed N-acetylgalactosaminide at 0.5% of the rate toward glucosaminide. The possibility of this very small galactosaminidase activity being due to contamination by the first enzyme could be excluded by several criteria. Three different criteria, gel filtration, acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, gave inconsistent results in the estimated molecular size of either enzyme. The two enzymes were, however, different in molecular size by any of the criteria. Precipitating antibody was produced in rabbits against the neutral beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. It specifically precipitated the enzyme but did not cross-react with the neutral beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase or the acid beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A and B. Physiological substrates for these neutral hexosaminidases are yet to be clarified."

The yields of Ca2+-ATPase were 4 to 5 and 1 to 2.2 mg/100 mg of cardiac and skeletal SR protein, respectively. The enzyme activities were 547 +/- 67 mumol ADP/mg/h for cardiac and 1192 +/- 172 mumol ADP/mg/h for skeletal Ca2+-ATPase. Removal of excess Triton X-100 increased the enzyme activities to 719 +/- 70 and 1473 +/- 206 mumol ADP/mg/h, respectively. The residual content of Triton X-100 for cardiac and skeletal Ca2+-ATPase was 20 and 5 mol/mol of enzyme, respectively. Maximum levels of phosphoenzyme were 4.4 +/- 0.2 and 5.6 +/- 0.6 nmol/mg in each case. A single protein band of 100 kDa was obtained for each purified Ca2+-ATPase by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The preparations were stable at -80 degrees C for 5 months in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. The phospholipid content of the purified enzyme was 2-fold greater than that of native cardiac and skeletal SR microsomes. Repeated washing of the purified enzyme preparation did not alter the phospholipid content or the specific activities."
https://openalex.org/W1541762510,"Ca2+ and tropomyosin are required for activation of ATPase activity of phosphorylated gizzard myosin by gizzard actin at less than 1 mM Mg2+, relatively low Ca2+ concentrations (1 microM), producing half-maximal activation. At higher concentrations, Mg2+ will replace Ca2+, 4 mM Mg2+ increasing activity to the same extent as does Ca2+ and abolishing the Ca2+ dependence. Above about 1 mM Mg2+, tropomyosin is no longer required for activation by actin, activity being dependent on Ca2+ between 1 and 4 mM Mg2+, but independent of [Ca2+] above 4 mM Mg2+. Phosphorylation of the 20,000-Da light chain of gizzard myosin is required for activation of ATPase activity by actin from chicken gizzard or rabbit skeletal muscle at all concentrations of Mg2+ employed. The effect of adding or removing Ca2+ is fully reversible and cannot be attributed either to irreversible inactivation of actin or myosin or to dephosphorylation. After preincubating in the absence of Ca2+, activity is restored either by adding micromolar concentrations of this cation or by raising the concentration of Mg2+ to 8 mM. Similarly, the inhibition found in the absence of tropomyosin is fully reversed by subsequent addition of this protein. Replacing gizzard actin with skeletal actin alters the pattern of activation by Ca2+ at concentrations of Mg2+ less than 1 mM. Full activation is obtained with or without Ca2+ in the presence of tropomyosin, while in its absence Ca2+ is required but produces only partial activation. Without tropomyosin, the range of Mg2+ concentrations over which activity is Ca2+-dependent is restricted to lower values with skeletal than with gizzard actin. The activity of skeletal muscle myosin is activated by the gizzard actin-tropomyosin complex without Ca2+, although Ca2+ slightly increases activity. The Ca2+ sensitivity of reconstituted gizzard actomyosin is partially retained by hybrid actomyosin containing gizzard myosin and skeletal actin, but less Ca2+ dependence is retained in the hybrid containing skeletal myosin and gizzard actin."
https://openalex.org/W1496398694,"Measurement of the inward rate of Ca2+ transport by rat liver microsomes under conditions of varying free intravesicular Ca2+ (1 microM to 5 mM) revealed that inward transport rate is maximum at low intravesicular Ca2+, and that transport rate decreases with an apparent inhibition constant of about 250-350 microM as intravesicular Ca2+ accumulates. This relationship is confirmed by measurement of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity; activity is greatest when intravesicular Ca2+ is 1 microM, is lower when intravesicular Ca2+ is 60 microM, and is minimum when intravesicular Ca2+ is 5 mM. Unexpectedly, the ratio of Ca2+ transport rate to Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis rate appears to be significantly greater than 2:1."

In isolated nucleoli, rChromatin largely retains the periodic activated structure characteristic of rChromatin in the nucleus. For all five major histone classes, the histone to DNA ratios of nucleolar chromatin are similar to those of bulk macronuclear chromatin. These results argue that the differences between activated rChromatin and inactivated chromatin are not due to a deficiency in the number of histones available to form nucleosomes on the rDNA."

Following such an incubation, the ATPase complex (F1F0) was isolated. Newly assembled F1-ATPase was detected by autoradiography of the isolated enzyme, only peptide subunits which had been made in vitro and imported into the isolated mitochondria could be radioactive. Incorporation of radiolabeled ATPase subunits into the enzyme does not occur in the presence of an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation or of a divalent metal chelator, nor does it occur in submitochondrial particles rather than intact mitochondria. Incorporation of labeled ATPase subunits into the enzyme can be completed by unlabeled subunits, provided the unlabeled proteins are added before the mitochondria are incubated with radioactive precursors. These findings suggest that F1-ATPase is assembled from a pool of subunits in mitochondria."

This was accomplished by the use of two-dimensional NMR analysis as well as specifically deuterated tyrosines. Not surprisingly, it shows that the published resonance assignment approached by more conventional methods by others includes substantial errors. The effect of complex formation with DNA was examined in the 1H NMR spectrum as well as in 19F NMR spectra from 3-fluorophenylalanine- or 3-fluorotyrosine-substituted cro repressors. The fluoro analogues show the practicality of using a structural gene cloned into an inducible system as a starting point to obtain both material and specific nuclear spin incorporation for NMR spectroscopy. The NMR data offer direct support for the speculative models of cro repressor-DNA complexes proposed from x-ray structure analysis on the protein alone."
https://openalex.org/W1539348211,"The actin-activated ATPase activities of myosin minifilaments and heavy meromyosin are similar at high actin concentrations. Under low ionic strength conditions, the minifilaments in Tris citrate buffer yield the same maximal turnover rate (Vmax) and apparent dissociation constant of actin from myosin (Kapp) as heavy meromyosin in standard low salt conditions. The time course of actin-activated ATP hydrolysis of minifilaments is similar to that observed for standard myosin preparations. Depending on the exact protein composition of the assay mixture, either the ATPase activity declines continuously with time, or is accelerated at the onset of superprecipitation. In analogy with myosin filaments, the ATPase of minifilaments shows a biphasic dependence on actin concentration. Super-precipitation of minifilaments follows a well resolved clearing phase during which their structural integrity appears to be fully preserved. These results indicate that minifilaments or similar small assemblies of myosin can fulfill contractile functions."

Idiotype-specific suppressor T lymphocytes selectively inhibit the expression of both lambda II- and lambda I-specific messenger RNA by MOPC-315 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1590023474,"The DNA sequence of 30 nucleotides which surrounds the origin of viral strand DNA replication is highly conserved amongst the icosahedral single-stranded DNA bacteriophages. The A gene of these phages encodes a protein which is required for initiation and termination of viral strand DNA synthesis and acts as a nicking-closing activity specifically within this 30-nucleotide sequence. A system of purified Escherichia coli host proteins and phi X174 gene A protein has been developed which specifically replicates in vitro the viral strand of phi X174 from RF (replicative form) I template DNA and yields single-stranded circular DNA products (RF leads to SS(c) DNA replication system). Recombinant plasmids carrying inserts derived from phage phi X174 or G4 DNA which range in length from 49 to 1175 base pairs and contain the 30-nucleotide conserved sequence have been shown to support phi X A protein-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro in this replication system. We report here that insertion of the 30-nucleotide sequence alone into pBR322 allows the resulting recombinant plasmids to support phi X A protein-dependent in vitro DNA synthesis as efficiently as phi X174 template DNA in the RF leads to SS(c) replication system. The 30-nucleotide sequence functions as a fully wild type DNA replication origin as determined by the rate of DNA synthesis and the structure of resulting DNA products. Furthermore, the DNA sequence requirements for nicking of RF I DNA by the phi X A protein and for supporting replication origin function have been partially separated. Homology to positions 1, 29, and 30 of the 30-nucleotide conserved sequence are not required for cleavage of RF I DNA by the A protein; homology to position 1 but not 29 or 30 is required for efficient DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1571339343,"A mutant strain of Neurospora crassa blocked in each of the initial steps of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine biosynthesis was previously shown to accumulate and secrete prephenate and L-arogenate (Jensen, R.A., Zamir, L.O., St. Pierre, M., Patel, N., and Pierson, D.L. (1977) J. Bacteriol. 132, 896-903). We now report the co-accumulation of yet another compound which was identified (Zamir, L.O., Tiberio, R., Jung, E., and Jensen, R.A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. (1983) 258, 6486-6491) as the lactam derivative of L-arogenate. This structure, spiro-arogenate, undergoes a facile acid-catalyzed conversion to L-phenylalanine (as does L-arogenate). Since L-arogenate is conveniently quantitated as 5-dimethylaminonapthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl)-phenylalanine following acidification and dansylation, the unknown presence of spiro-arogenate may easily lead to overestimation of L-arogenate present in mixtures. Reliable quantitative assays for both L-arogenate and spiro-arogenate in mixtures were designed utilizing [3H]dansyl-chloride and exploiting the inability of the spiro-arogenate molecule to be dansylated in contrast to L-arogenate. The initial appearance of spiro-arogenate during accumulation lagged behind prephenate and L-arogenate, and spiro-arogenate accumulation leveled off after 5 days while prephenate and L-arogenate accumulations continued. It seems likely that spiro-arogenate is derived directly from L-arogenate. Prephenate, L-arogenate, and spiro-arogenate comprised about 70, 15, and 15% fractions of the total accumulation in a representative accumulation experiment designed to maximize spiro-arogenate yields. Modest variations in co-metabolite ratios were obtained under nutritional conditions where carbon source, growth temperature, duration of incubation time, and amino acid additions were experimental variables."
https://openalex.org/W1489018854,"Reversible cross-linking with a cleavable homobifunctional reagent, dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate, of the Ca2+ ATPase polypeptides of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum produces oligomers in the range of 2 to 4 X 100,000 Da (cf. Louis, C. F., and Holroyd, J. A., (1979) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 535, 222-232). The presence of millimolar ATP during the dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate reaction protects the enzyme from inactivation without affecting cross-linking. In the presence of both ATP (e.g. 1 mM) and Ca2+ (e.g. 0.21 mM), there is no inhibition of phosphoenzyme (EP) formation and presteady state Ca2+ translocation, whereas Ca2+-induced conformational changes of the enzyme, and EP decomposition are inhibited. Cleavage of the S-S bond of the cross-links reverses the inhibition of conformational changes but has little effect on the inhibited EP decomposition. This indicates that the inhibition of conformational changes is due to cross-linking, while that of EP decomposition is due to the chemical modification as such. If [Ca2+] is low during the dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate reaction (e.g. pCa 7.6), the Ca2+-induced conformational changes of the enzyme, EP formation, presteady state Ca2+ translocation, and EP decomposition are inhibited, even in the presence of ATP. Cleavage of the cross-links reverses the inhibition of conformational changes and EP formation, but again has little effect on EP decomposition. Thus, the primary effect of cross-linking at high and low [Ca2+] is the inhibition of the Ca2+-induced conformational change, suggesting that extensive interaction of subunits is involved in this reaction step. The fact that EP formation and presteady state Ca2+ translocation are inhibited by cross-linking carried out at low but not at high [Ca2+] suggests that cross-linking takes place at different regions of the enzyme molecule at different [Ca2+]."

To date, six new oligosaccharides have been isolated by this procedure and have been sequenced by a combination of NaB3H4-labeling and deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid. The structures of these oligosaccharides were as follows: 1. GlcN-GlcUA-GlcN 2. GlcN-IdUA-GlcN 3. GlcN-GlcUA-GlcN-GlcUA-GlcN 4. GlcN-IdUA-GlcN-GlcUA-GlcN 5. GlcN-GlcUA-GlcN-IdUA-GlcN 6. GlcN-IdUA-GlcN-IdUA-GlcN The linkage positions and anomeric configurations were assumed to be the same as in the polysaccharides from which the oligosaccharides originated. The usefulness of some of these oligosaccharides as enzyme substrates was tested after appropriate modifications and radioactive labeling. Oligosaccharides 2 and 3 were N-[35S]sulfated and were found to serve as substrates for heparan N-sulfate sulfatase (heparin sulfamidase), with a homogenate of cultured skin fibroblasts as enzyme source. Similarly, reduction of oligosaccharide 2 with NaB3H4 yielded a substrate for acetyl-CoA:alpha-D-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase. Finally, the previously known disaccharide, 4-O-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-L-iduronic acid, which was isolated in the course of this work, was N-acetylated with [3H] acetic anhydride and was shown to be a substrate for N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminidase."

https://openalex.org/W1549819764,"Lanthanides are often considered to act as calcium analogues in biological systems. Activation profiles have been obtained as a function of terbium (Tb(III)), gadolinium (Gd(III)), and europium (Eu(III)) concentration, for the actin-activated ATPase of fully regulated myosins from both thick and thin filament regulated muscles. Scallop adductor myosin, a regulatory myosin, shows full apparent activation by free lanthanide. Activity declines rapidly with increasing lanthanide concentration reaching basal levels at 100 microM lanthanide. Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin, in the presence of rabbit skeletal troponin:tropomyosin, also shows full apparent activation by free lanthanide. However, contrary to expectation, lanthanides do not compete with calcium for the calcium-specific site of scallop myosin and therefore do not function as calcium analogues in this system. The activation curve is shown to be an artifact arising from the release of trace calcium from ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N-tetraacetic acid during lanthanide titration. Although the results with troponin:tropomyosin are necessarily more complex, the ability of lanthanides to turn on troponin:tropomyosin is brought into question."

https://openalex.org/W1497198599,"We measured rates of ATP synthesis by the proton-translocating ATPase of the motile Streptococcus strain V4051. Starved cells were energized artificially by exposing their membranes to a variable electrical potential difference (internal medium negative) and a fixed pH difference (internal medium alkaline). The initial rates of ATP synthesis increased exponentially with protonmotive force. The results were the same in D2O and H2O; there was no solvent isotope effect. At a fixed protonmotive force, the rates were strongly dependent on temperature, as expected for a reaction with a large enthalpy of activation. At a different protonmotive force, the rates varied with temperature in an identical fashion; there was no change in the enthalpy of activation. We conclude that protonation-deprotonation steps are not rate limiting and that the protons that cross the membrane drive ATP synthesis by mass action. The transmembrane electric field acts by changing the concentrations of the reactants, not by changing the configuration of the enzyme-substrate complex."
