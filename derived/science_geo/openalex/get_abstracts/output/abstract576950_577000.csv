https://openalex.org/W2563744641,"Subarcsecond localization of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 shows that its source is co-located with a faint galaxy with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus, or a previously unknown type of extragalactic source. Shami Chatterjee et al. report the subarcsecond localization of the Arecibo-discovered fast radio burst FRB 121102, the only known repeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric observations that directly image the bursts. FRBs are radio flashes of unknown physical nature with durations of milliseconds. Previous observations have lacked the resolution to uniquely identify a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. The localization of FRB 121102 reveals a persistent radio and optical source that is coincident with the bursts to within 100 milliarcseconds. The enigmatic persistent source could be a neutron star within its nebula in a distant host galaxy, a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus, or a previously unknown type of extragalactic source. Fast radio bursts1,2 are astronomical radio flashes of unknown physical nature with durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival times suggest an extragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities that are orders of magnitude larger than those of all known short-duration radio transients3. So far all fast radio bursts have been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute localizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host galaxy) have relied on the contemporaneous variability of field sources4 or the presence of peculiar field stars5 or galaxies4. These attempts have not resulted in an unambiguous association6,7 with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here we report the subarcsecond localization of the fast radio burst FRB 121102, the only known repeating burst source8,9,10,11, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric observations that directly image the bursts. Our precise localization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 milliarcseconds of a faint 180-microJansky persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with non-thermal emission, and a faint (twenty-fifth magnitude) optical counterpart. The flux density of the persistent radio source varies by around ten per cent on day timescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size of less than 1.7 milliarcseconds. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst having a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent star-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of extragalactic source. Localization and identification of a host or counterpart has been essential to understanding the origins and physics of other kinds of transient events, including gamma-ray bursts12,13 and tidal disruption events14. However, if other fast radio bursts have similarly faint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct subarcsecond localizations may be the only way to provide reliable associations."

The factors and mechanisms that mediate interactions between microbiota and the intestinal epithelium are not fully understood. We provide novel evidence that microbiota may control intestinal epithelial stem cell (IESC) proliferation in part through microRNAs (miRNAs). We demonstrate that miRNA profiles differ dramatically across functionally distinct cell types of the mouse jejunal intestinal epithelium and that miRNAs respond to microbiota in a highly cell type-specific manner. Importantly, we also show that miRNAs in IESCs are more prominently regulated by microbiota compared with miRNAs in any other intestinal epithelial cell subtype. We identify miR-375 as one miRNA that is significantly suppressed by the presence of microbiota in IESCs. Using a novel method to knockdown gene and miRNA expression ex vivo enteroids, we demonstrate that we can knock down gene expression in Lgr5+ IESCs. Furthermore, when we knock down miR-375 in IESCs, we observe significantly increased proliferative capacity. Understanding the mechanisms by which microbiota regulate miRNA expression in IESCs and other intestinal epithelial cell subtypes will elucidate a critical molecular network that controls intestinal homeostasis and, given the heightened interest in miRNA-based therapies, may offer novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases associated with altered IESC function.

The intestinal epithelium is a single layer of cells exposed to the intestinal lumen and is composed of multiple cell types including the proliferative intestinal epithelial stem cells (IESCs) 3The abbreviations used are: IESCintestinal epithelial stem cellmiRNAmicroRNAIECintestinal epithelial cellEECenteroendocrine cellGFgerm-freeCVconventionalizedEGFPenhanced GFPCRconventionally raisedNSnon-sortedRPMMMreads per million mapped to miRNAsPCAprincipal component analysisLNAlocked nucleic acidFC-fold changeFDRfalse discovery rateUNCUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel HillqRTquantitative real-timeRQVrelative quantitative value. and progenitor cells (also known as transit amplifying cells) as well as differentiated absorptive enterocytes and secretory goblet, Paneth, and enteroendocrine cells (EECs). IESCs divide to yield more rapidly proliferating progenitors that give rise to all of the other intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) types and drive continuous renewal of the intestinal epithelium every ∼3–5 days (1Creamer B. Shorter R.G. Bamforth J. The turnover and shedding of epithelial cells.Gut. 1961; 2: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Proper renewal facilitates important intestinal epithelial functions including barrier integrity to protect against invasion of harmful toxins present in the intestinal lumen, nutrient digestion and absorption, and production of hormones that regulate systemic energy homeostasis. These physiological processes are mediated in part by interactions with resident microbiota (2Velasquez-Manoff M. Gut microbiome: the peacekeepers.Nature. 2015; 518: S3-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Studies using germ-free animals have demonstrated that gut microbiota influence intestinal barrier function, nutrient absorption, proliferation, differentiation, cellular signaling, and migration (3Everard A.

Commun. 2013; 4: 2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, less is known about miRNA expression and function in the intestinal epithelium compared with most other tissues. Recently, miRNAs were implicated in the regulation of IEC physiology (6McKenna L.B. Schug J. Vourekas A. McKenna J.B. Bramswig N.C. Friedman J.R. Kaestner K.H.

Furthermore, the presence of microbiota in the gut has been shown to alter miRNA expression profiles in intestinal macrophages (8Wang D. Xia M. Yan X. Li D. Wang L. Xu Y. Jin T. Ling W.

Understanding the mechanisms by which microbiota regulate miRNA and gene expression in IESCs and other IEC subtypes will elucidate a critical molecular network that controls intestinal homeostasis and, given the heightened interest in miRNA-based therapies, may offer novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases associated with altered IESC function. However, no study to date has investigated miRNA expression and activity across the functionally distinct IEC subtypes, and cell type-specific effects of microbiota on miRNAs is completely unknown. We hypothesized that each IEC population has a distinct miRNA profile and that miRNAs respond to gut microbiota in a cell type-specific manner in order to control function and overall homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium. We selected the well characterized Sox9-EGFP transgenic mouse model to evaluate miRNA expression and effect of microbiota in functionally distinct IECs. This model was originally created by GENSAT (11Gong S. Zheng C. Doughty M.L. Losos K. Didkovsky N. Schambra U.B. Nowak N.J. Joyner A. Leblanc G. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. A gene expression atlas of the central nervous system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes.Nature. 2003; 425: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar), who developed the model by randomly inserting into the mouse genome a BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) containing the EGFP gene driven by the cloned genomic regions upstream and downstream of Sox9 (12Formeister E.J.

Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2009; 296: G1108-G1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A beneficial feature of this model is that EGFP expression is fully penetrant within the mouse intestine, which permits the isolation and analysis of four distinct IEC populations (12Formeister E.J. Sionas A.L. Lorance D.K. Barkley C.L. Lee G.H. Magness S.T. Distinct SOX9 levels differentially mark stem/progenitor populations and enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine epithelium.Am. J.

Applying the same fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based approach used to isolate IESCs from the commonly used Lgr5-EGFP model, which demonstrates mosaic expression among crypts in the intestine, both actively cycling IESCs (Sox9Low) and transit-amplifying progenitor cells (Sox9Sublow) can be isolated from the Sox9-EGFP mouse intestine (12Formeister E.J.

Moreover, two additional differentiated cell populations can also be isolated on the basis of variable EGFP intensity, including Sox9Neg (mostly differentiated enterocytes as well as goblet cells and Paneth cells) and Sox9High (primarily EECs as well as reserve/quiescent +4 stem cells) (12Formeister E.J.

To evaluate the effect of microbiota on miRNA expression in IECs, we first took a conventionalization approach (Fig. 1a). A 2-week conventionalization was selected because previous studies have shown this to be a time point at which the gene expression profile begins stabilizing in the small intestine of young mice after conventionalization (18El Aidy S. van Baarlen P.

The gut microbiota elicits a profound metabolic reorientation in the mouse jejunal mucosa during conventionalisation.Gut. 2013; 62: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After generating germ-free (GF) Sox9-EGFP animals at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Gnotobiotic core facility, we selected four pairs of female GF Sox9-EGFP littermates from four different litters born between February and July 2015. One littermate from each pair was randomly selected at 8–10 weeks of age for conventionalization. The 2-week conventionalization resulted in a slightly decreased body weight relative to the remaining germ-free sibling along with a commensurate increase in liver weight (Fig. 2). However, no significant differences were observed in the length of the small intestine or colon between GF and conventionalized (CV) animals (Fig. 2). IECs were collected from the mid-region of the small intestine (“Experimental Procedures”), hereafter referred to as jejunum, of the GF and CV animals, and FACS was performed based on Sox9-EGFP intensity (Fig. 1a). Special care was taken to gate out cellular debris, dead and dying cells, immune cells, and multiplets during FACS (see “Experimental Procedures”; Fig. 3). Additionally, a strict gating scheme was used to avoid contamination between cell populations. To evaluate the accuracy of the sorting in our hands, we performed qRT-PCR on sorted cells from 10-week-old female conventionally raised Sox9-EGFP mice and demonstrated clear enrichment of Chga in the Sox9High population, Lgr5 in the Sox9Low population, and Mttp in the non-sorted cells (which consists primarily of enterocytes) and the Sox9Neg population (Fig. 1b). As these genes are known to be enriched in EECs, IESCs, and enterocytes, respectively, these data confirm the utility and accuracy of the sorting method for isolating functionally distinct subpopulations of the intestinal epithelium.FIGURE 2Physiological parameters observed at the time of sacrifice of female GF and 2-week CV mice at 10–12 weeks of age (n = 4 each). a, weight of spleen in grams. b, length of small intestine (SI) from pyloric sphincter to caecum in centimeters (cm). c, length of the colon from caecum to anus in cm. d, ratio of spleen weight to body weight (BW). e, body weight in grams. f, liver weight in grams. g, ratio of liver weight to body weight.

We found very similar abundances of Sox9Sublow cells (transit amplifying) and Sox9Neg cells (enterocytes, Paneth, and goblet) in CV and GF populations relative to CR mice (Fig. 1c). Notably, GF mice had significantly more Sox9High cells (EECs) than CR mice (−fold change = 2.04, p = 0.04; Fig. 1c), which is consistent with previous studies comparing EECs in the jejunum of GF and CR rodents (21Uribe A.

Schumacher U. The diet and gut microflora influence the distribution of enteroendocrine cells in the rat intestine.Experientia. 1996; 52: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Also, there were on average fewer Sox9Low cells (actively cycling IESCs) in GF mice relative to CR and CV mice, which has not been shown before but could help explain previous reports suggesting reduced proliferation in the small intestine of GF animals (20El Aidy S.

To evaluate the transcriptional changes that occur in response to conventionalization in the IESCs of GF and CV animals, we performed RNA sequencing analysis on the Sox9Low population (which we will refer to as IESCs for simplicity). We identified 823 genes and long, non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) significantly elevated in GF IESCs and 334 genes and lncRNAs significantly elevated in CV IESCs (Fig. 4a).

The genes elevated in GF IESCs genes were associated with processes related to hormone secretion and transport (Fig. 4b). Consistent with these findings, in CV IESCs we observed that established markers of proliferation (Ccnb1, Cdk1, and Mki67) were significantly up-regulated, positive transcriptional regulators of IESC proliferation and self-renewal (Gata4 and Gata6) were up-regulated, and negative regulators of IESC proliferation and self-renewal (Bmp4) were down-regulated (Fig. 4c). Also, some, but not all, classic markers of EECs were up-regulated in GF IESCs (Fig. 4c), which could indicate some priming for cells to enter the EEC lineage, consistent with our observation that GF mice have more Sox9High cells. Known markers of reserve (quiescent) stem cells were not significantly different between CV and GF IESCs (Fig. 4c) nor were markers for Paneth cells (Lyz), goblet cells (Muc2), and enterocytes (Elf3). These data confirm that the Sox9Low cells are indeed enriched for IESCs and that CV IESCs harbor a gene signature consistent with increased proliferative capacity. As miRNAs are known regulators of proliferation and differentiation, we performed small RNA sequencing of each of the functionally distinct IEC subpopulations from four CR, GF, and CV animals. Total RNA was isolated from the four sorted populations from each animal as well as from non-sorted IECs (NS IECs; NS IECs were purified by FACS but not sorted based on Sox9-EGFP intensity). Small RNA-sequencing was performed in three batches, two of which contained small RNA libraries from sorted and unsorted IECs from two GF animals and two CV animals. The third batch contained libraries of the four CR animals. miRNAs and their isoforms (called isomiRs) were quantified using miRquant, our previously described method (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) (29Baran-Gale J. Fannin E.E. Kurtz C.L. Sethupathy P. Beta cell 5′-shifted isomiRs are candidate regulatory hubs in type 2 diabetes.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e73240Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis that miRNAs are differentially expressed among functionally distinct IEC subtypes, we evaluated miRNAs with an expression level of at least 400 reads per million mapped to miRNAs (RPMMM) in one or more samples, identifying 149 robustly expressed miRNAs across all IEC populations. Many miRNAs were uniquely enriched in one IEC subtype relative to all others (>2-fold more highly expressed than any other cell type across all samples; Fig. 1d). For example, we found that miR-215 and miR-194 were enriched in Sox9Neg cells, which consist primarily of enterocytes. Both of these miRNAs are processed from a single primary miRNA transcript on Chr1 and were previously shown to be induced by HNF4α during differentiation of Caco-2 colon carcinoma cells (30Hino K. Tsuchiya K. Fukao T. Kiga K. Okamoto R. Kanai T. Watanabe M. Inducible expression of microRNA-194 is regulated by HNF-1 during intestinal epithelial cell differentiation.RNA. 2008; 14: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Five miRNAs were enriched in Sox9High cells (EECs and reserve stem cells) including miR-182–5p and miR-183–5p (Fig. 1d), which are also generated from a single primary miRNA transcript. Consistent with enrichment in a subpopulation of cells composed largely of EECs, miR-182 has been shown to have important functions in other endocrine cells, specifically, pancreatic beta cells (31Melkman-Zehavi T. Oren R. Kredo-Russo S. Shapira T. Mandelbaum A.D. Rivkin N. Nir T. Lennox K.A. Behlke M.A. Dor Y. Hornstein E. miRNAs control insulin content in pancreatic β-cells via downregulation of transcriptional repressors.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we did not find any miRNAs enriched in the Sox9Low IESCs or Sox9Sublow progenitors, which are the only actively proliferating cell populations (Fig. 1d). To further assess variability within and across samples, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and assess the effect of microbial presence on each sample. The first three principal components (PC1-PC3) captured 67% of the variability across samples. Using biplots, we evaluated segregation of samples by cell type and mouse condition (GF, CV, or CR). We showed that miRNA expression profiles were sufficient to cluster most samples by their respective cell types regardless of microbial status (Fig. 5, a and b). For example, Sox9Neg cells and NS IECs were tightly clustered, which is expected given that NS IECs are composed of 85–90% Sox9Neg cells. When we compared the samples using PC1 and PC2, GF Sox9Low IESCs did not cluster together with CV and CR Sox9Low IESCs (Fig. 5a), indicating that IESCs are particularly sensitive to the presence or absence of microbiota. However, when PC1 and PC3 were projected, clear cell type-specific clustering was observed regardless of mouse condition (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the subset of miRNAs loaded into PC2 (∼40 miRNAs) contributed to the grouping observed in Fig. 5a. Taken together, these data indicate strong cell type-specific expression of miRNAs across IEC populations and a robust effect of microbial presence on the IESC population specifically. Both observations are supported by visualization of the most highly expressed miRNAs across GF and CV samples (Fig. 5c). To evaluate the cell type-specific sensitivity to microbial status and to account for batch and littermate effects, we used a linear modeling approach (see “Experimental Procedures”). We found the expression levels of 11 miRNAs (miR-34a-5p, miR-200c-3p, miR-200c-3p-1, miR-143-3p, miR-130b-3p, miR-140–3p+1, miR-378–3p+1, miR-20a-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-93-5p, and miR-29a-3p) to be significantly influenced by microbial status across all cell populations. These miRNAs in general were elevated in CV mice across all cell populations, although the magnitude of the effect was always most pronounced in the Sox9Low (IESC) population. When we assessed changes specific to each cell type, we were surprised to find that although many miRNAs were altered significantly in the IESC population in the CV state relative to GF, no miRNAs were identified as significantly changed specifically in the Sox9High, Sox9Sublow, or Sox9Neg populations (Fig. 6a, supplemental File 1). A total of 19 miRNAs in IESCs were significantly different in expression depending on microbial status (Fig. 6b). This finding underscores the highly cell type-specific effect of microbial presence on miRNAs. Of these 19 microbiota-sensitive miRNAs in IESCs, miR-375-3p was ∼2.5-fold (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.003) reduced in CV IESCs compared with GF IESCs and was the most highly expressed (Fig. 6, a and b). Notably, miR-375-3p was 2.4- and 7.2-fold more highly expressed than the next-most significant microbiota-sensitive miRNA in the CV and GF IESC populations, respectively (Fig. 6b). We also found that its isomiRs, miR-375-3p-1 and miR-375-3p+1, were also both significantly down-regulated in IESCs upon conventionalization ((−fold change (FC) = −2.45, FDR = 0.0006; FC = −2.47, FDR = 0.02, respectively; Fig. 6b). qRT-PCR on Sox9Low cells confirmed that the miR-375-3p family was significantly down-regulated by conve"
https://openalex.org/W2568633826,"Protein corona of nanoparticles (NPs), which forms when these particles come in to contact with protein-containing fluids, is considered as an overlooked factor in nanomedicine. Through numerous studies it has been becoming increasingly evident that it importantly dictates the interaction of NPs with their surroundings. Several factors that determine the compositions of NPs protein corona have been identified in recent years, but one has remained largely ignored—the composition of media used for dispersion of NPs. Here, we determined the effect of dispersion media on the composition of protein corona of polyacrylic acid-coated cobalt ferrite NPs (PAA NPs) and silica NPs. Our results confirmed some of the basic premises such as NPs type-dependent specificity of the protein corona. But more importantly, we demonstrated the effect of the dispersion media on the protein corona composition. The differences between constituents of the media used for dispersion of NPs, such as divalent ions and macromolecules were responsible for the differences in protein corona composition formed in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS). Our results suggest that the protein corona composition is a complex function of the constituents present in the media used for dispersion of NPs. Regardless of the dispersion media and FBS concentration, majority of proteins from either PAA NPs or silica NPs coronas were involved in the process of transport and hemostasis. Interestingly, corona of silica NPs contained three complement system related proteins: complement factor H, complement C3 and complement C4 while PAA NPs bound only one immune system related protein, α-2-glycoprotein. Importantly, relative abundance of complement C3 protein in corona of silica NPs was increased when NPs were dispersed in NaCl, which further implies the relevance of dispersion media used to prepare NPs."

https://openalex.org/W2950077732,"Accurate maps of promoters and enhancers are required for understanding transcriptional regulation. Promoters and enhancers are usually mapped by integration of chromatin assays charting histone modifications, DNA accessibility, and transcription factor binding. However, current algorithms are limited by unrealistic data distribution assumptions. Here we propose GenoSTAN (Genomic STate ANnotation), a hidden Markov model overcoming these limitations. We map promoters and enhancers for 127 cell types and tissues from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, today’s largest compendium of chromatin assays. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that GenoSTAN generally identifies promoters and enhancers with significantly higher accuracy than previous methods. Moreover, GenoSTAN-derived promoters and enhancers showed significantly higher enrichment of complex trait-associated genetic variants than current annotations. Altogether, GenoSTAN provides an easy-to-use tool to define promoters and enhancers in any system, and our annotation of human transcriptional cis-regulatory elements constitutes a rich resource for future research in biology and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2570702585,"The Jeotgalicoccus sp. peroxygenase cytochrome P450 OleTJE (CYP152L1) is a hydrogen peroxide-driven oxidase that catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of fatty acids, producing terminal alkenes with applications as fine chemicals and biofuels. Understanding mechanisms that favor decarboxylation over fatty acid hydroxylation in OleTJE could enable protein engineering to improve catalysis or to introduce decarboxylation activity into P450s with different substrate preferences. In this manuscript, we have focused on OleTJE active site residues Phe79, His85, and Arg245 to interrogate their roles in substrate binding and catalytic activity. His85 is a potential proton donor to reactive iron-oxo species during substrate decarboxylation. The H85Q mutant substitutes a glutamine found in several peroxygenases that favor fatty acid hydroxylation. H85Q OleTJE still favors alkene production, suggesting alternative protonation mechanisms. However, the mutant undergoes only minor substrate binding-induced heme iron spin state shift toward high spin by comparison with WT OleTJE, indicating the key role of His85 in this process. Phe79 interacts with His85, and Phe79 mutants showed diminished affinity for shorter chain (C10-C16) fatty acids and weak substrate-induced high spin conversion. F79A OleTJE is least affected in substrate oxidation, whereas the F79W/Y mutants exhibit lower stability and cysteine thiolate protonation on reduction. Finally, Arg245 is crucial for binding the substrate carboxylate, and R245E/L mutations severely compromise activity and heme content, although alkene products are formed from some substrates, including stearic acid (C18:0). The results identify crucial roles for the active site amino acid trio in determining OleTJE catalytic efficiency in alkene production and in regulating protein stability, heme iron coordination, and spin state."

Ten patients with a variety of facial deformities from oral clinical were included in the study. For each patient, a three-dimensional (3D) face model was acquired, via a high-accuracy industrial ""line-laser"" scanner (Faro), as the reference model and two test models were obtained, via a ""stereophotography"" (3dMD) and a ""structured light"" facial scanner (FaceScan) separately. Registration based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm was executed to overlap the test models to reference models, and ""3D error"" as a new measurement indicator calculated by reverse engineering software (Geomagic Studio) was used to evaluate the 3D global and partial (upper, middle, and lower parts of face) PA of each facial scanner. The respective 3D accuracy of stereophotography and structured light facial scanners obtained for facial deformities was 0.58±0.11 mm and 0.57±0.07 mm. The 3D accuracy of different facial partitions was inconsistent; the middle face had the best performance. Although the PA of two facial scanners was lower than their nominal accuracy (NA), they all met the requirement for oral clinic use."

The precise mechanisms of such injuries are still unknown as investigation is hampered by the difficulty in experimentally replicating the conditions under which these injuries occur. We harness the benefits of computer simulation to report on the creation and validation of i) a generic musculoskeletal model (MASI) for the analyses of cervical spine loading in healthy subjects, and ii) a population-specific version of the model (Rugby Model), for investigating cervical spine injury mechanisms during rugby activities. The musculoskeletal models were created in OpenSim, and validated against in vivo data of a healthy subject and a rugby player performing neck and upper limb movements. The novel aspects of the Rugby Model comprise i) population-specific inertial properties and muscle parameters representing rugby forward players, and ii) a custom scapula-clavicular joint that allows the application of multiple external loads. We confirm the utility of the developed generic and population-specific models via verification steps and validation of kinematics, joint moments and neuromuscular activations during rugby scrummaging and neck functional movements, which achieve results comparable with in vivo and in vitro data. The Rugby Model was validated and used for the first time to provide insight into anatomical loading and cervical spine injury mechanisms related to rugby, whilst the MASI introduces a new computational tool to allow investigation of spinal injuries arising from other sporting activities, transport, and ergonomic applications. The models used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and allow to integrate in silico analyses with experimental approaches in injury prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2570754102,"Chitinase-h (Chi-h) is of special interest among insect chitinases due to its exclusive distribution in lepidopteran insects and high sequence identity with bacterial and baculovirus homologs. Here OfChi-h, a Chi-h from Ostrinia furnacalis, was investigated. Crystal structures of both OfChi-h and its complex with chitoheptaose ((GlcN)7) reveal that OfChi-h possesses a long and asymmetric substrate binding cleft, which is a typical characteristics of a processive exo-chitinase. The structural comparison between OfChi-h and its bacterial homolog SmChiA uncovered two phenylalanine-to-tryptophan site variants in OfChi-h at subsites +2 and possibly −7. The F232W/F396W double mutant endowed SmChiA with higher hydrolytic activities toward insoluble substrates, such as insect cuticle, α-chitin, and chitin nanowhisker. An enzymatic assay demonstrated that OfChi-h outperformed OfChtI, an insect endo-chitinase, toward the insoluble substrates, but showed lower activity toward the soluble substrate ethylene glycol chitin. Furthermore, OfChi-h was found to be inhibited by N,N′,N″-trimethylglucosamine-N,N′,N″,N″′-tetraacetylchitotetraose (TMG-(GlcNAc)4), a substrate analog which can be degraded into TMG-(GlcNAc)1–2. Injection of TMG-(GlcNAc)4 into 5th-instar O. furnacalis larvae led to severe defects in pupation. This work provides insights into a molting-indispensable insect chitinase that is phylogenetically closer to bacterial chitinases than insect chitinases."
https://openalex.org/W2570945670,"Targeted metagenomics, also known as metagenetics, is a high-throughput sequencing application focusing on a nucleotide target in a microbiome to describe its taxonomic content. A wide range of bioinformatics pipelines are available to analyze sequencing outputs, and the choice of an appropriate tool is crucial and not trivial. No standard evaluation method exists for estimating the accuracy of a pipeline for targeted metagenomics analyses. This article proposes an evaluation protocol containing real and simulated targeted metagenomics datasets, and adequate metrics allowing us to study the impact of different variables on the biological interpretation of results. This protocol was used to compare six different bioinformatics pipelines in the basic user context: Three common ones (mothur, QIIME and BMP) based on a clustering-first approach and three emerging ones (Kraken, CLARK and One Codex) using an assignment-first approach. This study surprisingly reveals that the effect of sequencing errors has a bigger impact on the results that choosing different amplified regions. Moreover, increasing sequencing throughput increases richness overestimation, even more so for microbiota of high complexity. Finally, the choice of the reference database has a bigger impact on richness estimation for clustering-first pipelines, and on correct taxa identification for assignment-first pipelines. Using emerging assignment-first pipelines is a valid approach for targeted metagenomics analyses, with a quality of results comparable to popular clustering-first pipelines, even with an error-prone sequencing technology like Ion Torrent. However, those pipelines are highly sensitive to the quality of databases and their annotations, which makes clustering-first pipelines still the only reliable approach for studying microbiomes that are not well described."

These multiprotein complexes contain targeting domains that recognize post-translational marks on histones. One such targeting domain is the bromodomain (BD), which recognizes acetyl-lysines and recruits proteins to sites of acetylation across the genome. Polybromo1 (PBRM1), a subunit of the Polybromo-associated BRG1- or hBRM-associated factors (PBAF) chromatin remodeler, contains six tandem BDs and is frequently mutated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Mutations in the PBRM1 gene often lead to the loss of protein expression; however, missense mutations in PBRM1 have been identified and tend to cluster in the BDs, particularly BD2 and BD4, suggesting that individual BDs are critical for PBRM1 function. To study the role of these six BDs, we inactivated each of the six BDs of PBRM1 and re-expressed these mutants in Caki2 cells (ccRCC cells with the loss of function mutation in PBRM1). Four of the six BDs abrogated PBRM1 tumor suppressor function, gene regulation, and chromatin affinity with the degree of importance correlating strongly to the rate of missense mutations in patients. Furthermore, we identified BD2 as the most critical for PBRM1 and confirmed BD2-mediated association to histone H3 peptides acetylated at lysine 14 (H3K14Ac), validating the importance of this specific acetylation mark for PBRM1 binding. From these data, we conclude that four of the BDs act together to target PBRM1 to sites on chromatin; when a single BD is mutated, PBRM1 no longer controls gene expression properly, leading to increased cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2560630891,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are responsible for the regulation of target genes involved in various biological processes, and may play oncogenic or tumor suppressive roles. Many studies have investigated the relationships between miRNAs and their target genes, using mRNA and miRNA expression data. However, mRNA expression levels do not necessarily represent the exact gene expression profiles, since protein translation may be regulated in several different ways. Despite this, large-scale protein expression data have been integrated rarely when predicting gene-miRNA relationships. This study explores two approaches for the investigation of gene-miRNA relationships by integrating mRNA expression and protein expression data. First, miRNAs were ranked according to their effects on cancer development. We calculated influence scores for each miRNA, based on the number of significant mRNA-miRNA and protein-miRNA correlations. Furthermore, we constructed modules containing mRNAs, proteins, and miRNAs, in which these three molecular types are highly correlated. The regulatory interactions between miRNA and genes in these modules have been validated based on the direct regulations, indirect regulations, and co-regulations through transcription factors. We applied our approaches to glioblastomas (GBMs), ranked miRNAs depending on their effects on GBM, and obtained 52 GBM-related modules. Compared with the miRNA rankings and modules constructed using only mRNA expression data, the rankings and modules constructed using mRNA and protein expression data were shown to have better performance. Additionally, we experimentally verified that miR-504, highly ranked and included in the identified modules, plays a suppressive role in GBM development. We demonstrated that the integration of both expression profiles allows a more precise analysis of gene-miRNA interactions and the identification of a higher number of cancer-related miRNAs and regulatory mechanisms."

Aware of the efficacy limits of existing antidepressant drugs and the potential anti-inflammatory properties of propentofylline, we sought to evaluate the use of propentofylline as a depression treatment. We used a rat model of depression induced by repetitive lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administrations. We have studied sickness behavior, by assessing daily body weight, open field behavior, and TNF-α plasmatic levels. Anxiety-like behavior (light-dark test), depressive-like behavior (forced swim test), plasmatic levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, depression biomarker), and central glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression (an astrocyte biomarker) were also evaluated. LPS induced body weight loss, open field behavior impairments (decreased locomotion and rearing, and increased immobility), and increased TNF-α levels in rats, compared with control group. Thus, LPS induced sickness behavior. LPS also increased the immobility and reduced climbing in the forced swim test, when compared with the control group, i.e., LPS induced depressive-like behavior in rats. Propentofylline prevented sickness behavior after four days of consecutive treatment, as well as prevented the depressive-like behavior after five days of consecutive treatments. Propentofylline also prevented the increase in GFAP expression induced by LPS. Neither LPS nor propentofylline has influenced the anxiety and BDNF levels of rats. In conclusion, repetitive LPS administrations induced sickness behavior and depressive-like behavior in rats. Propentofylline prevented both sickness behavior and depressive-like behavior via neuroinflammatory pathway. The present findings may contribute to a better understanding and treatment of depression and associated diseases."

The operational activity of a CB is planned by aggregating space-time demand and similar passenger travel demands. Based on an analysis of domestic and international research and the current development of CBs in China and considering passenger travel data, this paper studies the problems associated with the operation of CBs, such as stop selection, line planning and timetables, and establishes a model for the stop planning and timetables of CBs. The improved immune genetic algorithm (IIGA) is used to solve the model with regard to the following: 1) multiple population design and transport operator design, 2) memory library design, 3) mutation probability design and crossover probability design, and 4) the fitness calculation of the gene segment. Finally, a real-world example in Beijing is calculated, and the model and solution results are verified and analyzed. The results illustrate that the IIGA solves the model and is superior to the basic genetic algorithm in terms of the number of passengers, travel time, average passenger travel time, average passenger arrival time ahead of schedule and total line revenue. This study covers the key issues involving operational systems of CBs, combines theoretical research and empirical analysis, and provides a theoretical foundation for the planning and operation of CBs."

Paradoxically, reperfusion results in nitroxidative stress and a marked inflammatory response in the heart. TRAF3IP2 (TRAF3 Interacting Protein 2; previously known as CIKS or Act1) is an oxidative stress-responsive cytoplasmic adapter molecule that is an upstream regulator of both IκB kinase (IKK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and an important mediator of autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Here we investigated the role of TRAF3IP2 in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced nitroxidative stress, inflammation, myocardial dysfunction, injury, and adverse remodeling. Our data show that I/R up-regulates TRAF3IP2 expression in the heart, and its gene deletion, in a conditional cardiomyocyte-specific manner, significantly attenuates I/R-induced nitroxidative stress, IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1 activation, inflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule expression, immune cell infiltration, myocardial injury, and contractile dysfunction. Furthermore, Traf3ip2 gene deletion blunts adverse remodeling 12 weeks post-I/R, as evidenced by reduced hypertrophy, fibrosis, and contractile dysfunction. Supporting the genetic approach, an interventional approach using ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction-mediated delivery of phosphorothioated TRAF3IP2 antisense oligonucleotides into the LV in a clinically relevant time frame significantly inhibits TRAF3IP2 expression and myocardial injury in wild type mice post-I/R.

Although TRAF3IP2 physically associates with IKK and activates NF-κB (15Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U.

Similar to NF-κB and AP-1, TRAF3IP2 is a highly inducible redox-sensitive adapter molecule. Its promoter region contains potential binding sites for AP-1, NF-κB, C/EBPβ, CREB, and IRF1 (18Zhao Z.

In fact, we have previously demonstrated that advanced oxidation protein products, which serve as markers of oxidative stress and mediators of inflammation, induce cardiomyocyte death in part via Nox2/Rac1/superoxide-dependent TRAF3IP2/JNK signaling (20Valente A.J.

However, it is not known whether TRAF3IP2 plays a causal role in myocardial I/R injury. Using both genetic (conditional cardiomyocyte-specific Traf3ip2 gene deletion) and interventional (ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD)-mediated delivery of phosphorothioated TRAF3IP2 antisense oligonucleotides into the LV chamber) approaches, we report for the first time that TRAF3IP2 plays a causal role in myocardial I/R injury, dysfunction, and adverse remodeling. We also determined that TRAF3IP2 might be a better therapeutic target than either NF-κB or JNK alone in reducing myocardial injury post-I/R. Previously, we demonstrated that 30-min ischemia/2-h reperfusion induces oxidative stress and activation of the oxidative stress-responsive transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 in the heart (23Chandrasekar B.

Because TRAF3IP2 is an oxidative stress-responsive cytoplasmic adapter molecule and upstream regulator of NF-κB and AP-1 (15Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. CIKS, a connection to IκB kinase and stress-activated protein kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10494-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Li X. Commane M. Nie H. Hua X.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that I/R will induce TRAF3IP2 expression in the heart. Wild type mice underwent 30-min ischemia/2-h reperfusion (Fig. 1A), and TRAF3IP2 expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. The level of TRAF3IP2 expressed in the myocardium of wild type mice was not significantly altered by either sham surgery (Fig. 1A), or treatment with ischemia alone (Fig. 1B). However, TRAF3IP2 expression was markedly up-regulated in a time-dependent manner in the heart post-I/R (Fig. 1B). Although increased expression was observed as early as 30 min after reperfusion, its levels increased further at 2 h reperfusion, and remained elevated even at 6 h reperfusion (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemistry revealed that TRAF3IP2 is present in cardiomyocytes localized to cytoplasm and membranes, and I/R increased its expression specifically in the ischemic (Is) zone (Fig. 1C). Confirming our hypothesis, these results indicate that I/R up-regulates TRAF3IP2 expression in the heart (Fig. 1). After having demonstrated that I/R up-regulates TRAF3IP2 expression in the heart (Fig. 1B), and is localized predominantly in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1C), we next determined whether TRAF3IP2 plays a causal role in I/R-induced myocardial injury, dysfunction, and adverse remodeling. We generated tamoxifen-regulated, cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific Traf3ip2 knock-out mice (Cre+/−;TRAF3IP2fl/+; CM-KO). At 2 months of age, both CM-KO and littermate controls (Cre+/−;TRAF3IP2+/+) received tamoxifen, and after 1 month, TRAF3IP2 levels were analyzed in the heart. Prior to tamoxifen administration, TRAF3IP2 expression was similar in both CM-KO and control mice (Fig. 2A, upper panel). However, 1 month after tamoxifen administration, TRAF3IP2 expression was markedly reduced only in the CM-KO mice (Fig. 2A, left lower panel). Furthermore, whereas TRAF3IP2 expression was readily detectable in both cardiomyocytes (CM) and cardiac fibroblasts isolated from the CM-KO mice without tamoxifen administration, its expression was markedly and selectively attenuated in CM following tamoxifen administration (Fig. 2B, upper panel). However, tamoxifen administration failed to affect TRAF3IP2 expression in non-target organs like lung, liver, and kidneys from the CM-KO mice (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that Traf3ip2 gene deletion was specific to cardiomyocytes. One month after tamoxifen administration, both control and CM-KO mice underwent 30 min I and 2 or 24 h reperfusion. Sham-operated and ischemia alone groups served as controls. Immunoblotting revealed that whereas I/R up-regulated TRAF3IP2 expression in control mice, its levels were significantly attenuated in the CM-KO group (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, echocardiography revealed that at baseline, the fractional shortening (FS) was similar in both control and CM-KO mice (∼47 ± 2.64%; Fig. 2E). However, FS was reduced to a larger extent after I/R in control (26 ± 3.46%; 55% reduction; Fig. 2E) compared with CM-KO mice (36 ± 4.2%; 21% reduction, Fig. 2E). Infarct size was measured after 24 h by TTC staining and planimetry (26Venkatachalam K. Prabhu S.D. Reddy V.S. Boylston W.H. Valente A.J. Chandrasekar B. Neutralization of interleukin-18 ameliorates ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial injury.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7853-7865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Animals with an area at risk of less than 18% were excluded from the study as these animals had little or no infarct. The mean I/R-induced infarct size of control mice was 46.7% (Fig. 2F). Notably, the I/R-induced infarct size was markedly attenuated in the CM-KO mice (a 71% reduction; Fig. 2F). These results indicate that Traf3ip2 gene deletion in a conditional cardiomyocyte-specific manner blunts contractile dysfunction and injury post-I/R (Fig. 2). Sustained nitroxidative stress contributes to contractile dysfunction and myocardial injury post-I/R (1Hausenloy D.J. Yellon D.M.

Nitric oxide, superoxide, and peroxynitrite in myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury and preconditioning.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Therefore we next determined whether I/R increases nitroxidative stress in the heart, and whether Traf3ip2 gene deletion blunts this response. Both control and CM-KO mice underwent I/R (Fig. 3A). The results show that whereas I/R increases H2O2 production in control mice within 30 min of reperfusion, its levels increased further at 1 h and declined gradually thereafter (Fig. 3A). Traf3ip2 gene deletion significantly reduced this effect (Fig. 3A). Similarly, I/R increased O2̇̄ generation, and this effect was also reduced by Traf3ip2 gene deletion (Fig. 3B). Supporting these data, tissue levels of lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde (MDA)/4-hydroxyalkenals (4-HNE)) were also markedly increased in hearts from control, but not CM-KO mice post-I/R (Fig. 3C). I/R also significantly increased the inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in control mice, but to a significantly lesser degree in the CM-KO mice (Fig. 3D). Similarly, I/R-induced nitrotyrosine levels were also markedly reduced in the CM-KO mice (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that Traf3ip2 gene deletion blunts nitroxidative stress in the heart post-I/R (Fig. 3). Increased oxidative stress plays a key role in the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, both of which regulate the expression of various inflammatory mediators. Because I/R-induced oxidative stress and TRAF3IP2 expression in the heart post-I/R, we next investigated whether Traf3ip2 gene deletion blunts activation of IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1, and induction of inflammatory mediators in the heart post-I/R. Results in Fig. 4A show that although I/R induced activation of IKKβ, p65, JNK, and c-Jun (Fig. 4A), and expression of IL-18, LIX, and ICAM1 (Fig. 4B), these changes were markedly attenuated in the CM-KO mice. Furthermore, RT2 ProfilerTM PCR Arrays revealed a marked increase in the mRNA expression of chemokines (Ccl2), chemokine receptors (Ccr2 and Ccr3), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-18, IL-33, and TNF-α), adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and LFA-1), growth factors (TGFβ and CTGF), and matrix metalloproteinases (2 and 9), and fibrillar collagens (Ia1 and IIIa1) in control mice, and these effects were markedly attenuated in the CM-KO mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Conditional cardiomyocyte-specific Traf3ip2 gene deletion significantly attenuated I/R-induced inflammatory and extracellular matrix genesInflammationI/R vs sham; fold-changeControlCM-KOCcl2 (MCP-1)2.5 ± 0.801.20 ± 0.12ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Ccl62.2 ± 0.320.81 ± 0.09ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Ccl9 (MIP1g)3.9 ± 0.981.22 ± 0.14ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Ccl176.8 ± 1.122.43 ± 0.32ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Ccr2 (MCP-1-R)3.8 ± 0.920.80 ± 0.08+Ccr3 (Eotaxin receptor)2.9 ± 0.781.10 ± 0.01ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Ccr53.13 ± 1.120.78 ± 0.03ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Cxcl5 (LIX)3.98 ± 0.831.12 ± 0.12ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Il1b2.31 ± 0.710.81 ± 0.04ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Il2rg0.93 ± 0.320.78 ± 0.41Il10ra2.11 ± 0.893.18 ± 1.12Il17a2.1 ± 0.780.89 ± 0.09ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Il17f1.98 ± 0.310.43 ± 0.24Il332.34 ± 0.221.18 ± 0.32Itgb22.9 ± 0.711.89 ± 0.51Mif1.9 ± 0.180.62 ± 0.12ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Pf41.2 ± 0.080.81 ± 0.02Tgfb13.1 ± 0.241.78 ± 0.11ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Tnfa2.98 ± 0.231.12 ± 0.32ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Tnfrsf1a2.0 ± 0.180.32 ± 0.01ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Extracellular matrixCdh38.3 ± 0.323.10 ± 0.56ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Col1a12.9 ± 0.210.78 ± 0.09ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Col3a11.8 ± 0.210.41 ± 0.07ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Col5a18.1 ± 1.122.31 ± 0.02ap < at least 0.05 versus control.CTGF5.1 ± 0.912.14 ± 0.91ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Ctnna10.12 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.23Ecm12.3 ± 0.261.12 ± 0.02ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Emilin12.1 ± 0.311.08 ± 0.32Fn17.3 ± 1.112.31 ± 0.54ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Itga41.2 ± 0.320.07 ± 0.01ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Itga52.8 ± 0.781.12 ± 0.49ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Itgal0.2 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.01Itgb10.8 ± 0.120.04 ± 0.01ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Itgb22.1 ± 0.421.11 ± 0.03Mmp22.3 ± 0.010.71 ± 0.02ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Mmp92.1 ± 0.260.32 ± 0.02ap < at least 0.05 versus control.THBS23.2 ± 0.211.32 ± 0.02ap < at least 0.05 versus control.TNC21 ± 1.1913.8 ± 1.21ap < at least 0.05 versus control.RT-qPCRIl63.1 ± 0.391.2 ± 0.32ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Il6R (IL-6RA)4.2 ± 0.782.3 ± 0.21ap < at least 0.05 versus control.IL6ST (gp130)3.7 ± 0.911.9 ± 0.13ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Il183.4 ± 0.320.78 ± 0.21ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Cxcl2 (MIP-2a)2.39 ± 0.181.12 ± 0.31ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Itgal (LFA-1)3.0 ± 0.711.19 ± 0.12ap < at least 0.05 versus control.Icam12.9 ± 0.321.23 ± 0.21ap < at least 0.05 versus control.a p < at least 0.05 versus control. Open table in a new tab Having demonstrated that the gene expression of various inflammatory mediators is markedly reduced in hearts from the CM-KO mice following 30-min ischemia/2-h reperfusion (Fig. 4 and Table 1), we next analyzed changes in protein levels of inflammatory mediators at 24-h reperfusion using a Quantibody® Mouse Cytokine Antibody Array that simultaneously detects changes in 200 proteins. Again, the results showed a marked inhibition in the protein levels of various inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules), and MMPs in the CM-KO hearts (Table 2). Furthermore, systemic levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-18, IL-33, and TNF-α were also significantly reduced in the CM-KO mice (Fig. 4C). Traf3ip2 gene deletion also attenuated tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a surrogate marker for neutrophils, in the heart post-I/R (Fig. 4D).TABLE 2Conditional cardiomyocyte-specific Traf3ip2 gene deletion markedly attenuates various pro-inflammatory and remodeling-associated factors in post-ischemic heartTargetI/R vs sham; fold-changeControlCM-KOInflammationCytokinesG-CSF2.1 ± 0.040.98 ± 0.12ap at least 0.05 versus control.gp1302.32 ± 0.230.78 ± 0.12ap at least 0.05 versus control.IL-1β3.12 ± 0.541.12 ± 0.21ap at least 0.05 versus control.IL-62.3 ± 0.320.78 ± 0.07ap at least 0.05 versus control.IL-100.21 ± 0.014.12 ± 0.48IL-17A1.98 ± 0.980.54 ± 0.04ap at least 0.05 versus control.IL-17F2.1 ± 1.120.79 ± 0.32ap at least 0.05 versus control.IFN-γ3.12 ± 0.920.64 ± 0.08Lipocalin-21.98 ± 0.780.32 ± 0.01ap at least 0.05 versus control.MCSF2.13 ± 1.120.56 ± 0.01ap at least 0.05 versus control.RAGE2.34 ± 0.210.89 ± 0.21ap at least 0.05 versus control.TNF-α2.56 ± 0.340.73 ± 0.01ap at least 0.05 versus control.TWEAK2.13 ± 0.451.78 ± 0.54TWEAKR3.08 ± 0.731.18 ± 0.12ap at least 0.05 versus control.P-selectin1.98 ± 0.310.43 ± 0.08ap at least 0.05 versus control.Chemokines, adhesion moleculesCCL52.29 ± 0.310.89 ± 0.08ap at least 0.05 versus control.CXCL162.34±.210.78 ± 0.11ap at least 0.05 versus control.Fractalkine3.4 ± 0.811.21 ± 0.32ap at least 0.05 versus control.6Ckine2.1 ± 0.210.58 ± 0.11ap at least 0.05 versus control.E-selectin1.98 ± 0.030.71 ± 0.01ICAM13.23 ± 0.211.21 ± 0.10ap at least 0.05 versus control.KC (CXCL1)2.98 ± 0.320.89 ± 0.12ap at least 0.05 versus control.LIX (CXCL5)3.11 ± 0.190.54 ± 0.01ap at least 0.05 versus control.MIP-22.21 ± 0.230.38 ± 0.01ap at least 0.05 versus control.MAdCAM-13.1 ± 0.210.98 ± 0.31ap at least 0.05 versus control.P-cadherin1.98 ± 0.110.41 ± 0.01ap at least 0.05 versus control.VCAM-13.12 ± 0.731.18 ± 0.42ap at least 0.05 versus control.Fibrosis and ECM"
https://openalex.org/W2569997744,"Aconitine (ACO) is well-known for causing lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. While cardiac Na+ channel opening during repolarization has long been documented in animal cardiac myocytes, the cellular effects and mechanism of ACO in human remain unexplored. This study aimed to assess the proarrhythmic effects of ACO in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). ACO concentration-dependently (0.3 ~ 3.0 μM) shortened the action potentials (AP) durations (APD) in ventricular-like hiPSC-CMs by > 40% and induced delayed after-depolarization. Laser-scanning confocal calcium imaging analysis showed that ACO decreased the duration and amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients and increased in the beating frequencies by over 60%. Moreover, ACO was found to markedly reduce the L-type calcium channel (LTCC) currents (ICa,L) in hiPSC-CMs associated with a positive-shift of activation and a negative shift of inactivation. ACO failed to alter the peak and late Na+ currents (INa) in hiPSC-CMs while it drastically increased the late INa in Guinea-pig ventricular myocytes associated with enhanced activation/delayed inactivation of INa at -55 mV~ -85 mV. Further, the effects of ACO on ICa,L, INa and the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (Ikr) were validated in heterologous expression systems by automated voltage-clamping assays and a moderate suppression of Ikr was observed in addition to concentration-dependent ICa,L inhibition. Lastly, increased beating frequency, decreased Ca2+ wave and shortened field potential duration were recorded from hiPSC-CMs by microelectrode arrays assay. In summary, our data demonstrated that LTCC inhibition could play a main role in the proarrhythmic action of ACO in human cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2569743124,"The paracaspase MALT1 has arginine-directed proteolytic activity triggered by engagement of immune receptors. Recruitment of MALT1 into activation complexes is required for MALT1 proteolytic function. Here, co-expression of MALT1 in HEK293 cells, either with activated CARD11 and BCL10 or with TRAF6, was used to explore the mechanism of MALT1 activation at the molecular level. This work identified a prominent self-cleavage site of MALT1 isoform A (MALT1A) at R781 (R770 in MALT1B) and revealed that TRAF6 can activate MALT1 independently of the CBM. Intramolecular cleavage at R781/R770 removes a C-terminal TRAF6-binding site in both MALT1 isoforms, leaving MALT1B devoid of the two key interaction sites with TRAF6. A previously identified auto-proteolysis site of MALT1 at R149 leads to deletion of the death-domain, thereby abolishing interaction with BCL10. By using MALT1 isoforms and cleaved fragments thereof, as well as TRAF6 WT and mutant forms, this work shows that TRAF6 induces N-terminal auto-proteolytic cleavage of MALT1 at R149 and accelerates MALT1 protein turnover. The MALT1 fragment generated by N-terminal self-cleavage at R149 was labile and displayed enhanced signaling properties that required an intact K644 residue, previously shown to be a site for mono-ubiquitination of MALT1. Conversely, C-terminal self-cleavage at R781/R770 hampered the ability for self-cleavage at R149 and stabilized MALT1 by hindering interaction with TRAF6. C-terminal self-cleavage had limited impact on MALT1A but severely reduced MALT1B proteolytic and signaling functions. It also abrogated NF-κB activation by N-terminally cleaved MALT1A. Altogether, this study provides further insights into mechanisms that regulate the scaffolding and activation cycle of MALT1. It also emphasizes the reduced functional capacity of MALT1B as compared to MALT1A."
https://openalex.org/W2569928682,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most economically relevant viral pathogens in pigs and causes substantial losses in the pig industry worldwide each year. At present, PRRSV vaccines do not effectively prevent and control this disease. Consequently, it is necessary to develop new antiviral strategies to compensate for the inefficacy of the available vaccines. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an important member of the histone deacetylase family that is responsible for regulating many important biological processes. Studies have shown that HDAC6 has anti-viral activities during the viral life cycle. However, whether HDAC6 overexpression enhances resistance to PRRSV in pigs remains unknown. In this study, we used a somatic cell cloning method to produce transgenic (TG) pigs that constitutively overexpress porcine HDAC6. These TG pigs showed germ line transmission with continued overexpression of HDAC6. In vitro, virus-challenged porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) overexpressed HDAC6, which suppressed viral gene expression and PRRSV production. In vivo, resistance to PRRSV in TG pigs was evaluated by direct or cohabitation mediated infection with a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain. Compared with non-TG (NTG) siblings, TG pigs showed a significantly lower viral load in the lungs and an extended survival time after infection with HP-PRRSV via intramuscular injection. In the cohabitation study, NTG pigs housed with challenged NTG pigs exhibited significantly worse clinical symptoms than the other three in-contact groups. These results collectively suggest that HDAC6 overexpression enhances resistance to PRRSV infection both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest the potential involvement of HDAC6 in the response to PRRSV, which will facilitate the development of novel therapies for PRRSV."

https://openalex.org/W2567804685,"What motivates the research strategies of nations and institutions? We suggest that research primarily serves two masters–altruism and economic growth. Some nations focus more research in altruistic (or non-economic) fields while others focus more research in fields associated with economic growth. What causes this difference? Are there characteristics that would suggest why a nation is more aligned with altruism or economic growth? To answer this question, we have identified nine major fields of research by analyzing the publication activity of 4429 institutions using Scopus data. Two fields of research are clearly altruistic (there is relatively little involvement by industry) and two fields are clearly aligned with economic growth. The altruistic vs. economic nature of nations based on their publication profiles across these fields is correlated with national indicators on wealth, education, capitalism, individualism, power, religion, and language. While previous research has suggested that national research strategy is aligned with national wealth, our analysis shows that national wealth is not highly correlated with the tradeoff between altruistic and economic motives. Instead, the tradeoff is largely captured by a culture of individualism. Accordingly, implications for national research strategies are discussed."

We previously reported that the inhibition of the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) SIRT2 induces granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cells, suggesting the involvement of protein acetylation in ATRA-induced leukemia cell differentiation. Herein, we show that p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (PCAF), a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), is a prerequisite for ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cells. We found that PCAF expression was markedly increased in leukemia cell lines (NB4 and HL-60) and primary APL cells during ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. Consistent with these results, the expression of PCAF was markedly up-regulated in the bone marrow cells of APL patients who received ATRA-containing chemotherapy. The knockdown of PCAF inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cell lines and primary APL cells. Conversely, the overexpression of PCAF induced the expression of the granulocytic differentiation marker CD11b at the mRNA level. Acetylome analysis identified the acetylated proteins after ATRA treatment, and we found that histone H3, a known PCAF acetylation substrate, was preferentially acetylated by the ATRA treatment. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that PCAF is required for the acetylation of histone H3 on the promoter of ATRA target genes, such as CCL2 and FGR, and for the expression of these genes in ATRA-treated leukemia cells. These results strongly support our hypothesis that PCAF is induced and activated by ATRA, and the subsequent acetylation of PCAF substrates promotes granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cells. Targeting PCAF and its downstream acetylation targets could serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome all subtypes of AML.

https://openalex.org/W2569647951,"In order to improve the quality of services at village clinics (VCs), which are important primary care service providers in rural China, the Chinese government has encouraged the township hospitals to own and manage VCs. There are currently three models of ownership and management of VCs: township hospital-owned and -managed (HVC), village committee-owned and -managed (VVC), and private-owned and -managed (PVC). This study aims to examine the association between these ownership models of VCs and patients' primary care experiences.Villagers were selected by multistage stratified sampling and their experiences with primary care were measured using the Primary Care Assessment Tool-Adult Edition (PCAT-AS). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and the questionnaires administered by investigators in the cross-sectional study from February to April 2015. The PCAT scores were compared among the three models by covariance analysis, and multiple linear regression was used to analyze factors associated with the PCAT total scores.A total of 1491 questionnaires were collected. After controlling for covariates, HVCs reported the highest PCAT scores and satisfaction rate. In terms of the domains, HVC reported the highest scores in the coordination and comprehensiveness domains, while PVC had the highest scores in the first contact-accessibility domain. Multivariate linear regression showed that HVC, married participants, aged 60 and older, satisfied with the services, receiving six or more visits, and those with medical expenditures over 20% of their total family expenditures, were also positively associated with better primary care quality.This study demonstrates that villagers receiving medical care at HVCs perceived better primary care than those at PVCs and VVCs. In order to improve the quality of primary care at VCs, it is necessary to increase government subsidies for public service packages, tighten the township hospital's supervision of PVCs and VVCs, and develop performance-based incentive plans to motivate improvements in the accessibility of HVCs."

Despite this well documented association, identification of the lectin′s physiological ligand and, accordingly, biological function has proven experimentally difficult. YKL-40 has been shown to bind chito-oligosaccharides; however, the production of chitin by the human body has not yet been documented. Possible alternative ligands include proteoglycans, polysaccharides, and fibers like collagen, all of which makeup the extracellular matrix. It is likely that YKL-40 is interacting with these alternative polysaccharides or proteins within the body, extending its function to cell biological roles such as mediating cellular receptors and cell adhesion and migration. Here, we consider the feasibility of polysaccharides, including cello-oligosaccharides, hyaluronan, heparan sulfate, heparin, and chondroitin sulfate, and collagen-like peptides as physiological ligands for YKL-40. We use molecular dynamics simulations to resolve the molecular level recognition mechanisms and calculate the free energy of binding the hypothesized ligands to YKL-40, addressing thermodynamic preference relative to chito-oligosaccharides. Our results suggest that chitohexaose and hyaluronan preferentially bind to YKL-40 over collagen, and hyaluronan is likely the preferred physiological ligand, because the negatively charged hyaluronan shows enhanced affinity for YKL-40 over neutral chitohexaose. Collagen binds in two locations at the YKL-40 surface, potentially related to a role in fibrillar formation. Finally, heparin non-specifically binds at the YKL-40 surface, as predicted from structural studies. Overall, YKL-40 likely binds many natural ligands in vivo, but its concurrence with physical maladies may be related to associated increases in hyaluronan.

https://openalex.org/W2570445237,"The Gal4 protein is a well-known prototypic acidic activator that has multiple activation domains. We have previously identified a new activation domain called the nine amino acid transactivation domain (9aaTAD) in Gal4 protein. The family of the 9aaTAD activators currently comprises over 40 members including p53, MLL, E2A and other members of the Gal4 family; Oaf1, Pip2, Pdr1 and Pdr3. In this study, we revised function of all reported Gal4 activation domains. Surprisingly, we found that beside of the activation domain 9aaTAD none of the previously reported activation domains had considerable transactivation potential and were not involved in the activation of transcription. Our results demonstrated that the 9aaTAD domain is the only decisive activation domain in the Gal4 protein. We found that the artificial peptides included in the original Gal4 constructs were results of an unintended consequence of cloning that were responsible for the artificial transcriptional activity. Importantly, the activation domain 9aaTAD, which is the exclusive activation domain in Gal4, is also the central part of a conserved sequence recognized by the inhibitory protein Gal80. We propose a revision of the Gal4 regulation, in which the activation domain 9aaTAD is directly linked to both activation function and Gal80 mediated inhibition."

Despite the large number of experimental and clinical studies conducted on pulmonary hypertension, there is no comprehensive work that analyzed the global research activity on PH so far. We retrieved the bibliometric data of the publications on pulmonary hypertension for two periods from the Web of science database. Here, we set the first investigation period from 1900 to 2007 (t1) due to the cited half life of articles and the relating difficulties to interpret the citation parameters. The second evaluation period (t2) covers the time interval from 2008 onwards including the year 2015. The data were analyzed and processed to density-equalizing maps using the NewQIS platform. A total number of 18,986 publications were identified in t1 that come from 85 countries. The US published the highest number of publications (n = 7,290), followed by the UK, Germany, Japan and France. In t2 19,676 items could be found worked out by 130 countries. The raking started just the same with the USA as most publishing nation with 7,127 publications on PH, followed by the UK and Germany. Japan fell back on 6th place, whereas China came into view on the 5th position. Analyzing the average citation rate as a parameter for research quality, Mexico reached the highest value in t1 and Ireland in t2. While, the country specific h-index underlined the leading position of the US research in both evaluation periods again. The average number of international collaboration items was expanding from none in 1978 to 530 items in 2015 with the USA as the country with the highest number of collaboration articles. The present study is the first large scale density-equalizing mapping and scientometric analysis of global PH research activity. Our data draw a sketch of the global research architecture in this field, indicating a need for specific research programs in countries with a lower human development index."

We used these techniques to investigate two Norwegian families with an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with cataracts and mental retardation.Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip analysis followed by Exome sequencing identified a 2 bp homozygous deletion in GBA2 in both families, c.1528_1529del [p.Met510Valfs*17]. Furthermore, we report the biochemical characterization of GBA2 in these patients. Our studies show that a reduced activity of GBA2 is sufficient to elevate the levels of glucosylceramide to similar levels as seen in Gaucher disease. Furthermore, leucocytes seem to be the proper enzyme source for in vitro analysis of GBA2 activity.We report GBA2 mutations causing a Marinesco-Sjögren-like syndrome in two Norwegian families. One of the families was originally diagnosed with Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome based on an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with cataracts and mental retardation. Our findings highlight the phenotypic variability associated with GBA2 mutations, and suggest that patients with Marinesco-Sjögren-like syndromes should be tested for mutations in this gene."
https://openalex.org/W2568287554,"Intranasal vaccination is more potent than parenteral injection for the prevention of influenza. However, because the poor efficiency of antigen uptake across the nasal mucosa is a key issue, immunostimulatory adjuvants are essential for intranasal vaccines. The immunomodulator mannatide or polyactin (PA) has been used for the clinical treatment of impaired immunity in China, but its adjuvant effect on an inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (ITIV) via intranasal vaccination is unclear. To explore the adjuvant effect of PA, an inactivated trivalent influenza virus with or without PA or MF59 was instilled intranasally once a week in BALB/c mice. Humoral immunity was assessed by both the ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) methods using antigen-specific antibodies. Splenic lymphocyte proliferation and the IFN-γ level were measured to evaluate cell-mediated immunity. The post-vaccination serum HI antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) for the H1N1 and H3N2 strains, antigen-specific serum IgG and IgA GMTs, mucosal SIgA GMT, splenic lymphocyte proliferation, and IFN-γ were significantly increased in the high-dose PA-adjuvanted vaccine group. The seroconversion rate and the mucosal response for the H3N2 strain were significantly elevated after high-dose PA administration. These adjuvant effects of high-dose PA for the influenza vaccine were comparable with those of the MF59 adjuvant, and abnormal signs or pathological changes were not found in the evaluated organs. In conclusion, PA is a novel mucosal adjuvant for intranasal vaccination with the ITIV that has safe and effective mucosal adjuvanticity in mice and successfully induces both serum and mucosal antibody responses and a cell-mediated response."

The present study investigated how the level of anesthesia affects ABR recordings in an amphibian species, Babina daunchina. To do this, we compared ABRs evoked by tone pip stimuli recorded from 35 frogs when Tricaine methane sulphonate (MS-222) anesthetic immersion times varied from 0, 5 and 10 minutes after anesthesia induction at sound frequencies between 0.5 and 6 kHz. ABR thresholds increased significantly with immersion time across the 0.5 kHz to 2.5 kHz frequency range, which is the most sensitive frequency range for hearing and the main frequency range of male calls. There were no significant differences for anesthetic levels across the 3 kHz to 6 kHz range. ABR latency was significantly longer in the 10 min group than in the 0 and 5 min groups at frequencies of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5 kHz, while ABR latency did not differ across the 3 kHz to 4 kHz range and at 2.0 kHz. Taken together, these results show that the level of anesthesia affects the amplitude, threshold and latency of ABRs in frogs."
https://openalex.org/W2568029029,"Visual feedback in general, and from the body in particular, is known to influence the performance of motor skills in humans. However, it is unclear how the acquisition of motor skills depends on specific visual feedback parameters such as the size of performing effector. Here, 21 healthy subjects physically trained to perform sequences of finger movements with their right hand. Through the use of 3D Virtual Reality devices, visual feedback during training consisted of virtual hands presented on the screen, tracking subject's hand movements in real time. Importantly, the setup allowed us to manipulate the size of the displayed virtual hands across experimental conditions. We found that performance gains increase with the size of virtual hands. In contrast, when subjects trained by mere observation (i.e., in the absence of physical movement), manipulating the size of the virtual hand did not significantly affect subsequent performance gains. These results demonstrate that when it comes to short-term motor skill learning, the size of visual feedback matters. Furthermore, these results suggest that highest performance gains in individual subjects are achieved when the size of the virtual hand matches their real hand size. These results may have implications for optimizing motor training schemes."
https://openalex.org/W2568565924,"Non-muscle myosin II (NMII) is a conserved force-producing cytoskeletal enzyme with important but poorly understood roles in cell migration. To investigate myosin heavy chain (MHC) phosphorylation roles in 3D migration, we expressed GFP-tagged NMIIA wild-type or mutant constructs in cells depleted of endogenous NMIIA protein. We find that individual mutation or double mutation of Ser-1916 or Ser-1943 to alanine potently blocks recruitment of GFP-NM-IIA filaments to leading edge protrusions in 2D, and this in turn blocks maturation of anterior focal adhesions. When placed in 3D collagen gels, cells expressing wild-type GFP MHC-IIA behave like parental cells, displaying robust and active formation and retraction of protrusions. However, cells depleted of NMIIA or cells expressing the mutant GFP MHC-IIA display severe defects in invasion and in stabilizing protrusions in 3D. These studies reveal an NMIIA-specific role in 3D invasion that requires competence for NMIIA phosphorylation at Ser-1916 and Ser-1943. In sum, these results demonstrate a critical and previously unrecognized role for NMIIA phosphorylation in 3D invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2570082551,"Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is a severe human autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydroxylase (FAH), an enzyme catalyzing the last step in the tyrosine degradation pathway. Lack of FAH causes accumulation of toxic metabolites (fumarylacetoacetate and succinylacetone) in blood and tissues, ultimately resulting in severe liver and kidney damage with onset that ranges from infancy to adolescence. This tissue damage is lethal but can be controlled by administration of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC), which inhibits tyrosine catabolism upstream of the generation of fumarylacetoacetate and succinylacetone. Notably, in animals lacking FAH, transient withdrawal of NTBC can be used to induce liver damage and a concomitant regenerative response that stimulates the growth of healthy hepatocytes. Among other things, this model has raised tremendous interest for the in vivo expansion of human primary hepatocytes inside these animals and for exploring experimental gene therapy and cell-based therapies. Here, we report the generation of FAH knock-out rabbits via pronuclear stage embryo microinjection of transcription activator-like effector nucleases. FAH-/- rabbits exhibit phenotypic features of HT1 including liver and kidney abnormalities but additionally develop frequent ocular manifestations likely caused by local accumulation of tyrosine upon NTBC administration. We also show that allogeneic transplantation of wild-type rabbit primary hepatocytes into FAH-/- rabbits enables highly efficient liver repopulation and prevents liver insufficiency and death. Because of significant advantages over rodents and their ease of breeding, maintenance, and manipulation compared with larger animals including pigs, FAH-/- rabbits are an attractive alternative for modeling the consequences of HT1."

https://openalex.org/W2571368068,"Cochlear implants provide individuals who are deaf with access to speech. Although substantial advancements have been made by novel technologies, there still is high variability in language development during childhood, depending on adaptation and neural plasticity. These factors have often been investigated in the auditory domain, with the mismatch negativity as an index for sensory and phonological processing. Several studies have demonstrated that the MMN is an electrophysiological correlate for hearing improvement with cochlear implants. In this study, two groups of cochlear implant users, both with very good basic hearing abilities but with non-overlapping speech performance (very good or very poor speech performance), were matched according to device experience and age at implantation. We tested the perception of phonemes in the context of specific other phonemes from which they were very hard to discriminate (e.g., the vowels in /bu/ vs. /bo/). The most difficult pair was individually determined for each participant. Using behavioral measures, both cochlear implants groups performed worse than matched controls, and the good performers performed better than the poor performers. Cochlear implant groups and controls did not differ during time intervals typically used for the mismatch negativity, but earlier: source analyses revealed increased activity in the region of the right supramarginal gyrus (220–260 ms) in good performers. Poor performers showed increased activity in the left occipital cortex (220–290 ms), which may be an index for cross-modal perception. The time course and the neural generators differ from data from our earlier studies, in which the same phonemes were assessed in an easy-to-discriminate context. The results demonstrate that the groups used different language processing strategies, depending on the success of language development and the particular language context. Overall, our data emphasize the role of neural plasticity and use of adaptive strategies for successful language development with cochlear implants."
https://openalex.org/W2568941808,"Aquatic environments are heavily impacted by human activities including climate warming and the introduction of xenobiotics. Due to the application of silver nanoparticles as bactericidal agent the introduction of silver into the environment strongly has increased during the past years. Silver ions affect the primary metabolism of algae, in particular photosynthesis. Mixotrophic algae are an interesting test case as they do not exclusively rely on photosynthesis which may attenuate the harmful effect of silver. In order to study the effect of silver ions on mixotrophs, cultures of the chrysophyte Poterioochromonas malhamensis were treated in a replicate design in light and darkness with silver nitrate at a sub-lethal concentration. At five time points samples were taken for the identification and quantitation of proteins by mass spectrometry. In our analysis, relative quantitative protein mass spectrometry has shown to be a useful tool for functional analyses in conjunction with transcriptome reference sequences. A total of 3,952 proteins in 63 samples were identified and quantified, mapping to 4,829 transcripts of the sequenced and assembled transcriptome. Among them, 720 and 104 proteins performing various cellular functions were differentially expressed after eight days in light versus darkness and after three days of silver treatment, respectively. Specifically pathways of the energy and primary carbon metabolism were differentially affected by light and the utilization of expensive reactions hints to an energy surplus of P. malhamensis under light conditions. The excess energy is not invested in growth, but in the synthesis of storage metabolites. The effects of silver were less explicit, observable especially in the dark treatments where the light effect could not mask coinciding but weaker effects of silver. Photosynthesis, particularly the light harvesting complexes, and several sulphur containing enzymes were affected presumably due to a direct interference with the silver ions, mainly affecting energy supply."
https://openalex.org/W2569275115,"Positron emission tomography using 18F-Fluro-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG) is a useful tool to detect regions of inflammation in patients. We utilized this imaging technique to investigate the kinetics of gastrointestinal recovery after radiation exposure and the role of bone marrow in the recovery process. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were either sham irradiated, irradiated with their upper half body shielded (UHBS) at a dose of 7.5 Gy, or whole body irradiated (WBI) with 4 or 7.5 Gy. Animals were imaged using 18F-FDG PET/CT at 5, 10 and 35 days post-radiation exposure. The gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow were analyzed for 18F-FDG uptake. Tissue was collected at all-time points for histological analysis. Following 7.5 Gy irradiation, there was a significant increase in inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract as indicated by the significantly higher 18F-FDG uptake compared to sham. UHBS animals had a significantly higher activity compared to 7.5 Gy WBI at 5 days post-exposure. Animals that received 4 Gy WBI did not show any significant increase in uptake compared to sham. Analysis of the bone marrow showed a significant decrease of uptake in the 7.5 Gy animals 5 days post-irradiation, albeit not observed in the 4 Gy group. Interestingly, as the metabolic activity of the gastrointestinal tract returned to sham levels in UHBS animals it was accompanied by an increase in metabolic activity in the bone marrow. At 35 days post-exposure both gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow 18F-FDG uptake returned to sham levels. 18F-FDG imaging is a tool that can be used to study the inflammatory response of the gastrointestinal tract and changes in bone marrow metabolism caused by radiation exposure. The recovery of the gastrointestinal tract coincides with an increase in bone marrow metabolism in partially shielded animals. These findings further demonstrate the relationship between the gastrointestinal syndrome and bone marrow recovery, and that this interaction can be studied using non-invasive imaging modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2569237047,"Introduction Telomerase repairs the telomeric ends of chromosomes and is active in nearly all malignant cells. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to be oncogenic and potential interactions with the telomerase system require further study. We determined the effects of HCV infection on human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression and enzyme activity in primary human hepatocytes and continuous cell lines. Results Primary human hepatocytes and Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells showed early de novo TERT protein expression 2–4 days after infection and these events coincided with increased TERT promoter activation, TERT mRNA, and telomerase activity. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that NS3-4A protease-helicase, in contrast to core or NS5A, specifically bound to the C-terminal region of TERT through interactions between helicase domain 2 and protease sequences. Increased telomerase activity was noted when NS3-4A was transfected into cells, when added to reconstituted mixtures of TERT and telomerase RNA, and when incubated with high molecular weight telomerase ‘holoenzyme’ complexes. The NS3-4A catalytic effect on telomerase was inhibited with primuline or danoprevir, agents that are known to inhibit NS3 helicase and protease activities respectively. In HCV infected cells, NS3-4A could be specifically recovered with telomerase holoenzyme complexes in contrast to NS5A or core protein. HCV infection also activated the effector caspase 7 which is known to target TERT. Activation coincided with the appearance of lower molecular weight carboxy-terminal fragment(s) of TERT, chiefly sized at 45 kD, which could be inhibited with pancaspase or caspase 7 inhibitors. Conclusions HCV infection induces TERT expression and stimulates telomerase activity in addition to triggering Caspase activity that leads to increased TERT degradation. These activities suggest multiple points whereby the virus can influence neoplasia. The NS3-4A protease-helicase can directly bind to TERT, increase telomerase activity, and thus potentially influence telomere repair and host cell neoplastic behavior."

Simeprevir, given for 12 weeks as part of a 24- or 48-week combination regimen with PR is approved for the treatment of chronic HCV GT4 infection. Primary study objectives were assessment of efficacy and safety of simeprevir plus PR in treatment-naïve patients with HCV GT4 treated for 12 weeks. Primary efficacy outcome was sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Additional objectives included investigation of potential associations of rapid virologic response and baseline factors with SVR12.This multicentre, open-label, single-arm study (NCT01846832) evaluated efficacy and safety of simeprevir plus PR in 67 patients with HCV GT4 infection. Patients were treatment-naïve, aged 18-70 years with METAVIR F0-F2 fibrosis. Patients with early virologic response (HCV RNA <25 IU/mL [detectable/undetectable in IL28B CC patients or undetectable in IL28B CT/TT patients] at Week 2 and undetectable at Weeks 4 and 8) were eligible to stop all treatment at the end of Week 12, otherwise PR therapy was continued to Week 24.Of 67 patients treated, 34 (51%) qualified for 12-week treatment including all but one patient with IL28B CC genotype (14/15). All patients in the 12-week group had undetectable HCV RNA at end of treatment, and 97% (33/34) achieved SVR12. No new safety signals with simeprevir plus PR were identified. The proportion of patients experiencing Grade 3-4 adverse events was lower in the 12-week group than in the 24-week group.Our findings on simeprevir plus PR therapy shortened to 12 weeks in patients with HCV GT4 infection with favourable baseline characteristics and displaying early on-treatment virologic response are encouraging. No new safety signals were associated with simeprevir plus PR in this study.NCT01846832."
https://openalex.org/W2570294337,"Objective Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive fibroinflammatory liver disease. Autotaxin (ATX) has a profibrotic effect resulting from lysophosphatidic acid activity. The purpose of this study was to examine ATX expression and ATX promoter methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes and liver tissues from BA patients and controls and investigate their associations with outcome parameters in BA patients. Methods A total of 130 subjects (65 BA patients and 65 age-matched controls) were enrolled. DNA was extracted from circulating leukocytes and liver tissues of BA patients and from and age-matched controls. ATX promoter methylation status was determined by bisulfite pyrosequencing. ATX expression was analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Decreased methylation of specific CpGs were observed at the ATX promoter in BA patients. Subsequent analysis revealed that BA patients with advanced stage had lower methylation levels of ATX promoter than those with early stage. ATX promoter methylation levels were found to be associated with hepatic dysfunction in BA. In addition, ATX expression was significantly elevated and correlated with a decrease in ATX promoter methylation in BA patients compared to the controls. Furthermore, promoter hypomethylation and overexpression of ATX were inversely associated with jaundice status, hepatic dysfunction, and liver stiffness in BA patients. Conclusion Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that ATX promoter methylation and ATX expression in peripheral blood may serve as possible biomarkers reflecting the progression of liver fibrosis in postoperative BA. These findings suggest that the promoter hypomethylation and overexpression of ATX might play a contributory role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in BA."

https://openalex.org/W2569463123,"Recently, Pulse Coupled Oscillator (PCO)-based travelling waves have attracted substantial attention by researchers in wireless sensor network (WSN) synchronization. Because WSNs are generally artificial occurrences that mimic natural phenomena, the PCO utilizes firefly synchronization of attracting mating partners for modelling the WSN. However, given that sensor nodes are unable to receive messages while transmitting data packets (due to deafness), the PCO model may not be efficient for sensor network modelling. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposed a new scheme called the Travelling Wave Pulse Coupled Oscillator (TWPCO). For this, the study used a self-organizing scheme for energy-efficient WSNs that adopted travelling wave biologically inspired network systems based on phase locking of the PCO model to counteract deafness. From the simulation, it was found that the proposed TWPCO scheme attained a steady state after a number of cycles. It also showed superior performance compared to other mechanisms, with a reduction in the total energy consumption of 25%. The results showed that the performance improved by 13% in terms of data gathering. Based on the results, the proposed scheme avoids the deafness that occurs in the transmit state in WSNs and increases the data collection throughout the transmission states in WSNs."

https://openalex.org/W2571181780,"Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have heterogeneities in their structures. Multiple studies have reported that the variety of post-translational modifications could affect the pharmacokinetic profiles or pharmacological potencies of therapeutic mAbs. Taking into the account that the structural modification of mAbs would affect the efficacy, it is worth investigating the structural alteration of therapeutic mAbs in the blood and the relationship between their structures and pharmacological effects. Herein, we have developed the method to isolate rituximab from plasma in which endogenous IgGs interfere the detection of rituximab, and successfully developed the analytical method with a liquid chromatograph time-of-flight mass spectrometer to detect the structure of rituximab in plasma with errors less than 30 parts per millions. Eight types of carbohydrate chains in rituximab were detected by this method. Interestingly, time-dependent changes in carbohydrate chains such as AAF (G2F) and GnGn (G0) were observed in rats, although the amino acids were stable. Additionally, these structural changes were observed via incubation in plasma as in the rat experiment, suggesting that a certain type of enzyme in plasma caused the alterations of the carbohydrate chains. The present analytical methods could clarify the actual pharmacokinetics of therapeutic mAbs, and help to evaluate the interindividual variations in pharmacokinetics and efficacy."
