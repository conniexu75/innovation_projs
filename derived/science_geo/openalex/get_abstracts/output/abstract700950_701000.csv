https://openalex.org/W4296797777,"Nurse, Midwives and Allied Health Professionals (AHPs), along with other health and social care colleagues are the backbone of healthcare services. They have played a key role in responding to the increased demands on healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper compares cross-sectional data on quality of working life, wellbeing, coping and burnout of nurses, midwives and AHPs in the United Kingdom (UK) at two time points during the COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous online repeated cross-sectional survey was conducted at two timepoints, Phase 1 (7 th May 2020-3 rd July 2020); Phase 2 (17 th November 2020-1 st February 2021). The survey consisted of the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, the Work-Related Quality of Life Scale, and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (Phase 2 only) to measure wellbeing, quality of working life and burnout. The Brief COPE scale and Strategies for Coping with Work and Family Stressors scale assessed coping strategies. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regressions examined the effects of coping strategies and demographic and work-related variables on wellbeing and quality of working life. A total of 1839 nurses, midwives and AHPs responded to the first or second survey, with a final sample of 1410 respondents -586 from Phase 1; 824 from Phase 2, (422 nurses, 192 midwives and 796 AHPs). Wellbeing and quality of working life scores were significantly lower in the Phase 2 sample compared to respondents in Phase 1 (p&lt;0.001). The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on psychological wellbeing and quality of working life which decreased while the use of negative coping and burnout of these healthcare professionals increased. Health services are now trying to respond to the needs of patients with COVID-19 variants while rebuilding services and tackling the backlog of normal care provision. This workforce would benefit from additional support/services to prevent further deterioration in mental health and wellbeing and optimise workforce retention."

https://openalex.org/W4296786637,"It is well known that the presence of comorbidities and age-related health issues may hide biochemical and metabolic features triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection and other diseases associated to hypoxia, as they are by themselves chronic inflammatory conditions that may potentially disturb metabolic homeostasis and thereby negatively impact on COVID-19 progression. To unveil the metabolic abnormalities inherent to hypoxemia caused by COVID-19, we here applied gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to analyze the main metabolic changes exhibited by a population of male patients less than 50 years of age with mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 without pre-existing comorbidities known to predispose to life-threatening complications from this infection. Several differences in serum levels of particular metabolites between normal controls and patients with COVID-19 as well as between mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 were identified. These included increased glutamic acid and reduced glutamine, cystine, threonic acid, and proline levels. In particular, using the entire metabolomic fingerprint obtained, we observed that glutamine/glutamate metabolism was associated with disease severity as patients in the severe COVID-19 group presented the lowest and higher serum levels of these amino acids, respectively. These data highlight the hypoxia-derived metabolic alterations provoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of pre-existing co-morbidities as well as the value of amino acid metabolism in determining reactive oxygen species recycling pathways, which when impaired may lead to increased oxidation of proteins and cell damage. They also provide insights on new supportive therapies for COVID-19 and other disorders that involve altered redox homeostasis and lower oxygen levels that may lead to better outcomes of disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W4296793779,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected cancer care in Japan, but the detailed impact on cancer diagnosis and treatment is not well-understood. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on digestive cancer care in Osaka Prefecture, which has a population of 8.8 million.We conducted a multi-center cohort study, using hospital-based cancer registry (HBCR) data linked to administrative data from 66 designated cancer care hospitals in Osaka. Records of patients diagnosed with cancer of the stomach, colorectum, esophagus, liver, gallbladder or pancreas were extracted from the HBCR data. Baseline characteristics, such as the number of diagnoses, routes to diagnosis and clinical stage, were compared between patients diagnosed in 2019 and those in 2020. We also compared treatment patterns such as the number of treatments (operations, endoscopic surgeries, chemotherapies, radiotherapies), pathological stage and time to treatment for each digestive cancer.In total, 62,609 eligible records were identified. The number of diagnoses decreased in 2020, ranging from -1.9% for pancreatic cancer to -12.7% for stomach cancer. Screen-detected cases decreased in stomach and colorectal cancer. The percentage of clinical stage III slightly increased across different cancers, although it was only significant for colorectal cancer. Among 52,741 records analyzed for treatment patterns, the relative decrease in radiotherapy was larger than for other treatments. The median time from diagnosis to operation was shortened by 2-5 days, which coincided with the decrease in operations.The impact of COVID-19 on cancer care in 2020 was relatively mild compared with other countries but was apparent in Osaka. Further investigation is needed to determine the most affected populations."
https://openalex.org/W4296796966,"To study the updated prevalence and clinical features of myasthenia gravis (MG) in Japan during 2017.We sent survey sheets to the randomly selected medical departments (number = 7,545). First, we asked the number of MG patients who visited medical departments from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017. Then, we sent the second survey sheet to the medical departments that answered the first survey to obtain the clinical information of patients who received MG diagnosis between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017.The received answer to the first survey were 2,708 (recovery rate: 35.9%). After all, the prevalence of the 100,000 population was estimated as 23.1 (95%CI: 20.5-25.6). As a result of the second survey, we obtained 1,464 case records. After checking the duplications and lacking data, we utilized 1,195 data for further analysis. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] from the onset age of total patients was 59 (43-70) years old. The male-female ratio was 1: 1.15. The onset age [median (IQR)] for female patients was 58 (40-72) years old, and that for male patients was 60 (49-69) years old (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.0299). We divided patients into four categories: 1) anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChRAb) (+) thymoma (Tm) (-), 2) AChRAb(+)Tm(+), 3) anti-muscle-specific kinase antibody (MuSKAb) (+), and AChRAb(-)MuSKAb(-) (double negative; DN). The onset age [median (IQR)] of AChRAb(+)Tm(-) was 64 (48-73) years old, and AChRb(+)Tm(+) was 55 (45-66), MuSKAb(+) was 49 (36-64), DN was 47 (35-60) year old. The multivariate logistic regression analysis using sex, initial symptoms, repetitive nerve stimulation test (RNST), and edrophonium test revealed that sex, ocular symptoms, bulbar symptoms, and RNST were factors to distinguish each category. The myasthenia gravis activities of daily living profile at the severest state were significantly higher in MuSKAb(+). MuSKAb(+) frequently received prednisolone, tacrolimus plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin; however, they received less acetylcholine esterase inhibitor. 99.2% of AChRAb(+)Tm(+) and 15.4% of AChRAb(+)Tm(-) received thymectomy. MuSKAb(+) did not receive thymectomy, and only 5.7% of DN received thymectomy. The prognosis was favorable in all categories.Our result revealed that the prevalence of Japanese MG doubled from the previous study using the same survey method in 2006. We also found that the onset age shifted to the elderly, and the male-female ratio reached almost even. Classification in four categories; AChRAb(+)Tm(-), AChRAb(+)Tm(+), MuSKAb(+), and DN, well describe the specific clinical features of each category and differences in therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4296545284,"How do climate change deniers differ from believers? Is there any correlation between human sentiment and deviations from historic temperature? We answer nine such questions using 13 years of Twitter data and 15 million tweets. Seven aspects are explored, namely, user gender, climate change stance and sentiment, aggressiveness, deviations from historic temperature, topics discussed, and environmental disaster events. We found that: a) climate change deniers use the term global warming much often than believers and use aggressive language, while believers tweet more about taking actions to fight the phenomenon, b) deniers are more present in the American Region, South Africa, Japan, and Eastern China and less present in Europe, India, and Central Africa, c) people connect much more the warm temperatures with man-made climate change than cold temperatures, d) the same regions that had more climate change deniers also tweet with negative sentiment, e) a positive correlation is observed between human sentiment and deviations from historic temperature; when the deviation is between −1.143° C and +2.401° C , people tweet the most positive, f) there exist 90% correlation between sentiment and stance, and -94% correlation between sentiment and aggressiveness, g) no clear patterns are observed to correlate sentiment and stance with disaster events based on total deaths, number of affected, and damage costs, h) topics discussed on Twitter indicate that climate change is a politicized issue and people are expressing their concerns especially when witnessing extreme weather; the global stance could be considered optimistic, as there are many discussions that point out the importance of human intervention to fight climate change and actions are being taken through events to raise the awareness of this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W4296796865,"The LoPF-Q 12–18 (Levels of Personality Functioning Questionnaire) was designed for clinical use and to promote early detection of personality disorder (PD). It is a self-report measure with 97 items to assess personality functioning in adolescents from 12 years up. It operationalizes the dimensional concept of personality disorder (PD) severity used in the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders and the ICD-11. In this study, we investigated the factorial structure of the LoPF-Q 12–18. Additionally, a short version was developed to meet the need of efficient screening for PD in clinical and research applications. To investigate the factorial structure, several confirmatory factor analysis models were compared. A bifactor model with a strong general factor and four specific factors showed the best nominal fit (CFI = .91, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .07). The short version was derived using the ant colony optimization algorithm. This procedure resulted in a 20-item version with excellent fit for a hierarchical model with four first order factors to represent the domains and a secondary higher order factor to represent personality functioning (CFI = .98, RMSEA = .05, SRMR = .04). Clinical validity (effect size d = 3.1 between PD patients and controls) and clinical utility (cutoff ≥ 36 providing 87.5% specificity and 80.2% sensitivity) for detecting patients with PD were high for the short version. Both, the long and short LoPF-Q 12–18 version are ready to be used for research and diagnostic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W4296808510,"Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular pathogen causing a severe zoonotic disease worldwide. The two-component regulatory system (TCS) BvrR/BvrS of B. abortus is conserved in members of the Alphaproteobacteria class. It is related to the expression of genes required for host interaction and intracellular survival. Here we report that bvrR and bvrS are part of an operon composed of 16 genes encoding functions related to nitrogen metabolism, DNA repair and recombination, cell cycle arrest, and stress response. Synteny of this genomic region within close Alphaproteobacteria members suggests a conserved role in coordinating the expression of carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways. In addition, we performed a ChIP-Seq analysis after exposure of bacteria to conditions that mimic the intracellular environment. Genes encoding enzymes at metabolic crossroads of the pentose phosphate shunt, gluconeogenesis, cell envelope homeostasis, nucleotide synthesis, cell division, and virulence are BvrR/BvrS direct targets. A 14 bp DNA BvrR binding motif was found and investigated in selected gene targets such as virB1, bvrR, pckA, omp25, and tamA. Understanding gene expression regulation is essential to elucidate how Brucella orchestrates a physiological response leading to a furtive pathogenic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4296545306,"Despite a deep literature studying the impact of inequality on policy outcomes, there has been limited effort to bring these insights into the debates about comparative support for government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We fill this gap by analyzing rich survey data at the beginning of the pandemic in April 2020 from six countries spanning different income levels and geographical locations—China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We find that poorer individuals are less supportive of government responses. Furthermore, poorer individuals residing in more economically unequal countries offer even less government support. We also find that both economic and non-economic factors could affect the poor’s decisions to support stringent government policies. These findings suggest that greater transfers to the poor may offer an option to help increase support for strict policies and may reduce the potential deepening of social inequalities caused by the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4296795719,"The success of mass vaccination programs against SARS-CoV-2 hinges on the public’s acceptance of the vaccines. During a vaccine roll-out, individuals have limited information about the potential side-effects and benefits. Given the public health concern of the COVID pandemic, providing appropriate information fast matters for the success of the campaign. In this paper, time-trends in vaccine hesitancy were examined using a sample of 35,390 respondents from the Eurofound’s Living, Working and COVID-19 (LWC) data collected between 12 February and 28 March 2021 across 28 European countries. The data cover the initial stage of the vaccine roll-out. We exploit the fact that during this period, news about rare cases of blood clots with low blood platelets were potentially linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine (or Vaxzeveria). Multivariate regression models were used to analyze i) vaccine hesitancy trends, and whether any trend-change was associated with the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine ii) and blood clots (AstraZeneca controversy), and iii) the suspension among several European countries. Our estimates show that vaccine hesitancy increased over the early stage of the vaccine roll-out (0·002, 95% CI: [0·002 to 0·003]), a positive shift took place in the likelihood of hesitancy following the controversy (0·230, 95% CI: [0·157 to 0·302]), with the trend subsequently turning negative (-0·007, 95% CI: [-0·010 to -0·005]). Countries deciding to suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine experienced an increase in vaccine hesitancy after the suspensions (0·068, 95% CI: [0·04 to 0·095]). Trust in institutions is negatively associated with vaccine hesitancy. The results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy increased steadily since the beginning of the vaccine roll-out and the AstraZeneca controversy and its suspension, made modest (though significant) contributions to increased hesitancy."
https://openalex.org/W4296802446,"Effective strategies to encourage COVID-19 vaccination should consider how health communication can be tailored to specific contexts. Our study aimed to evaluate the influence of three specific messaging appeals from two kinds of messengers on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in diverse countries. We surveyed 953 online participants in five countries (India, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Ukraine). We assessed participants’ perceptions of three messaging appeals of vaccination—COVID-19 disease health outcomes, social norms related to COVID-19 vaccination, and economic impact of COVID-19—from two messengers, healthcare providers (HCP), and peers. We examined participants’ ad preference and vaccine hesitancy using multivariable multinomial logistic regression. Participants expressed a high level of approval for all the ads. The healthcare outcome–healthcare provider ad was most preferred among participants from India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Ukraine. Participants in Kenya reported a preference for the health outcome–peer ad. The majority of participants in each country expressed high levels of vaccine hesitancy. However, in a final logistic regression model participant characteristics were not significantly related to vaccine hesitancy. These findings suggest that appeals related to health outcomes, economic benefit, and social norms are all acceptable to diverse general populations, while specific audience segments (i.e., mothers, younger adults, etc.) may have preferences for specific appeals over others. Tailored approaches, or approaches that are developed with the target audience’s concerns and preferences in mind, will be more effective than broad-based or mass appeals."
https://openalex.org/W4296803949,"Background Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer amongst women, and it is especially common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of the study was to determine the current patterns and characteristics of CC management in Zimbabwe in the HIV pandemic era, including the knowledge, attitude and practice of patience. Methods The study was a mixed method which incorporated a cross-sectional survey of 408 CC patients which was conducted from October 2019 to September 2020 using an interviewer administered paper questionnaire. The study was conducted at Parirenyatwa hospital, the only cancer treating public health facility in Harare, Zimbabwe. Differences in study outcome by categorical variables were assessed using the Person Chi-square (χ 2 ) test. Odds ratios (unadjusted and adjusted) and 95%CIs for potential risk factors associated with the outcome were estimated using logistic regression model. Results From a total of 408 CC patients recruited into the study no prevention mechanism was available or known to these patients and only 13% knew that CC is caused by Human papillomavirus. Only 87 (21%) had ever been screened for CC and 83 (97%) of those who had been screened had the visual inspection with acetic acid procedure done. Prevention (screening uptake) is statistically high among the educated (with secondary education OR = 9.497, 95%CI: 2.349–38.390; with tertiary OR = 59.381, 95%CI: 11.937–295.380). Late presentation varied statistically significantly with marital status (high among the divorced, OR = 2.866; 95% CI: 1.549–5.305 and widowed OR = 1.997; 95% CI: 1.112–3.587), was low among the educated (Tertiary OR = .393; 95% CI: .166-.934), low among those living in the rural (OR = .613; 95% CI: .375-.987), high among those with higher parity OR = 1.294; 95% CI: 1.163–1.439). Less than 1% of the patients had surgery done as a means of treatment. Radiotherapy was administered to 350 (86%) of the patients compared to chemotherapy administered to 155 (38%). A total of 350 (86%) have failed to take medication due to its unavailability, while 344 (85%) missed taking medication due to unaffordability. Complementary and alternative medicines were utilized by 235 (58%). Majority, 278 (68%) were HIV positive, mainly pronounced within age (36–49 years OR = 12.673; 95% CI: 2.110–76.137), among those with higher education (secondary education OR = 4.981; 95%CI: 1.394–17.802 and in those with no co-morbidities (893.956; 95%CI: 129.611–6165.810). Conclusion CC management was inadequate from prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and palliative care hence there is need to improve CC management in Zimbabwe if morbidity and mortality are to be reduced to acceptable levels. Education helped improve prevention, but reduces chances of diagnosis, working as a doubled edged sword in CC management Prevention was high among the educated. Those in rural areas experience poor CC management. It should be noted that general education is good; however it must be complimented by CC awareness to improve CC management outcomes holistically. Cervical cancer management services need to be decentralized so that those in rural areas have easy access. Given that those with co-morbidities and high parity have better CC management, CC services need to be tied to co-morbidity and antenatal/post-natal care and management services."
https://openalex.org/W4296808540,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension and diabetes are among the most fatal disease and prevalent among the adult population worldwide, including Bangladesh, and pose a public health threat. Understanding the socioeconomic inequalities linked to NCD risk factors can aid in the development of effective strategies to reduce the disease's recurrence. However, the literature on socioeconomic inequalities in hypertension and diabetes prevalence in Bangladesh is scant. Therefore, this study seeks to assess the inequality in hypertension and diabetes prevalence and to identify factors that may contribute to socioeconomic inequalities in Bangladesh.The current study incorporated data from a recent round of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS 2017-18). The age-standardized prevalence rates of hypertension and diabetes were reported, and the log-binomial regression technique was used to identify the relevant confounders. Additionally, socioeconomic inequalities were quantified using a regression-based decomposition technique in which the concentration index (CIX) and Concentration curve were produced to determine the socioeconomic factors contributing to inequality.Hypertension and diabetes were shown to have an age-standardized prevalence of (11.29% 95% CI: 11.13-11.69) and (36.98% 95% CI: 36.79-37.16), respectively. Both hypertension and diabetes were shown to be pointedly linked to the respondents' age, wealth status, being overweight or obese, and a variety of respondents' administrative divisions (p <0.001). In Bangladesh, household wealth status accounted for approximately 25.71% and 43.41% of total inequality in hypertension and diabetes, respectively. While BMI played a significant role in the emergence of inequality, the corresponding percentages for diabetes and hypertension are 4.95 and 83.38, respectively. In addition, urban areas contributed 4.56% inequality to increase diabetes among Bangladeshi inhabitants while administrative region contributed 4.76% of the inequality of hypertension.A large proportion of Bangladesh's adult population suffers from hypertension and diabetes. It is critical to recognize the value of equity-based initiatives in order to optimize the benefit-risk ratio and cost effectiveness of preventive health programmes. Integrating equity considerations into interventions is critical for policies and programmes to achieve their objectives. As a result, these findings can be taken into account when making existing and prospective policy decisions, as well as following its progression with economic development of Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4296808957,"Can the male citation advantage (more citations for papers written by male than female scientists) be explained by gender homophily bias, i.e., the preference of scientists to cite other scientists of the same gender category? Previous studies report much evidence that this is the case. However, the observed gender homophily bias may be overestimated by overlooking structural aspects such as the gender composition of research topics in which scientists specialize. When controlling for research topics at a high level of granularity, there is only little evidence for a gender homophily bias in citation decisions. Our study points out the importance of controlling structural aspects such as gendered specialization in research topics when investigating gender bias in science."

The aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which antibiotics are acquired without prescription in Sweden, and people's attitudes and motives linked to this practice. We use data from an online survey of a representative sample of the Swedish general population which included questions about respondents' antibiotic use, attitudes towards antibiotics, health care contacts, self-rated health and trust in health care. We also asked about their reason for obtaining/not obtaining antibiotics without a prescription. The results show that, in the last five years, 2,3% of the respondents had acquired antibiotics in other ways than from a Swedish physician having issued a prescription, and 4,3% reported that they are likely to do so in the future. We also show that the two most important reasons for non-prescription acquisition were physicians' refusal to prescribe antibiotics followed by travel abroad. The most important reason for not obtaining antibiotics without a prescription was to not contribute to antibiotic resistance. Using logistic regression, we show that non-prescription acquisition of antibiotics, and the intention to engage in this practice in the future, are strongly associated with low trust in health care."
https://openalex.org/W4296545286,"Common anesthesia practice for hand surgery combines a preoperative regional anesthetic and intraoperative monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Despite adequate regional anesthesia, patients may receive doses of intraoperative sedatives which can result in oversedation and potentially avoidable complications. VR could prove to be a valuable tool for patients and providers by distracting the mind from processing noxious stimuli resulting in minimized sedative use and reduced risk of oversedation without negatively impacting patient satisfaction. Our hypothesis was that intraoperative VR use reduces sedative dosing during elective hand surgery without detracting from patient satisfaction as compared to a usual care control.Forty adults undergoing hand surgery were randomized to receive either intraoperative VR in addition to MAC, or usual MAC. Patients in both groups received preoperative regional anesthesia at provider discretion. Intraoperatively, the VR group viewed programming of their choice via a head-mounted display. The primary outcome was intraoperative propofol dose per hour (mg · hr-1). Secondary outcomes included patient reported pain and anxiety, overall satisfaction, functional outcome, and post anesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay (LOS).Of the 40 enrolled patients, 34 completed the perioperative portion of the trial. VR group patients received significantly less propofol per hour than the control group (Mean (±SD): 125.3 (±296.0) vs 750.6 (±334.6) mg · hr-1, p<0.001). There were no significant differences between groups in patient reported overall satisfaction, (0-100 scale, Median (IQR) 92 (77-100) vs 100 (100-100), VR vs control, p = 0.087). There were no significant differences between groups in PACU pain scores, perioperative opioid analgesic dose, or in postoperative functional outcome. PACU LOS was significantly decreased in the VR group (53.0 (43.0-72.0) vs 75.0 (57.5-89.0) min, p = 0.018).VR immersion during hand surgery led to significant reductions in intraoperative propofol dose and PACU LOS without negatively impacting key patient reported outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4296793411,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major food crop worldwide. Low soil phosphorus content and drought are the main constraints on wheat production in Xinjiang, China.In this study, the ionic and metabolic responses of one wheat variety (""Xindong20"") to drought stress simulated by using polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG-6000) were investigated under low phosphorus (LP) and conventional phosphorus (CP) conditions by analysing wheat mineral elements and metabolites. Besides, due to xanthohumol was the metabolite with the most significant difference in expression detected in ""Xindong 20"", two wheat variety ""Xindong20 and Xindong 23"" were selected to conduct the germination test simultaneously, to further verify the function of xanthohumol in wheat growth. Xanthohumol was mixed with PEG solution (20%) to prepare PEG solutions with different concentrations (0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1%) of xanthohumol. Then wheat grains were soaked in the solutions for 20 hours, followed by a germination test. After 7 days, the indicators including shoot length, max root length, and root number were determined to identify whether the metabolite was beneficial to improve the drought tolerance of wheat.The results showed that the root density and volume of wheat in LP treatment were higher than those in CP treatment. The roots underwent programmed cell death both in LP and CP treatments under PEG-6000-simulated drought stress, however, the DNA degradation in root cells in LP treatment was lower than that in CP treatment after rehydration for 3 d. Before drought stress, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in shoot and the peroxidase (POD) activity in root in LP treatment were significantly higher than those in CP treatment, while the soluble sugar content and chlorophyll content in LP treatment were significantly lower than those in CP treatment. During drought stress, the POD activity maintained at a high level and the soluble sugar content gradually increased in LP treatment. After rehydration, the MDA content still maintained at a high level in LP treatment, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased, and the contents of soluble sugar and chlorophyll were significantly higher than those in CP treatment. The analysis of mineral elements and metabolites showed that the wheat in CP treatment was more sensitive to drought stress than that in LP treatment. Besides, the effect of drought stress was greater on shoot than on root in CP treatment, while it was opposite in LP treatment. The effect of drought stress on sugar metabolism gradually increased. Germination assays showed that 0.1% exogenous xanthohumol addition could significantly increase the shoot length of the two wheat varieties under drought stress.Appropriate low phosphorus supply could increase antioxidant enzyme activity in wheat, and enhance sugar metabolism to regulate osmotic balance, as well as the accumulation of various organic acids to maintain the intracellular ion homeostasis. Therefore, compared to the conventional phosphorus supply level, appropriate low phosphorus supply can significantly improve the drought tolerance of wheat. Additionally, addition of 0.1% exogenous xanthohumol, an important differential expressed metabolite in drought-stressed wheat, could effectively promote wheat shoot growth under drought stress."

https://openalex.org/W4296808075,"Anthrax is a zoonosis caused by the environmentally maintained, spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis , affecting humans, livestock, and wildlife nearly worldwide. Bacterial spores are ingested, inhaled, and may be mechanically transmitted by biting insects or injection as occurs during heroin-associated human cases. Herbivorous hoofstock are very susceptible to anthrax. When these hosts die of anthrax, a localized infectious zone (LIZ) forms in the area surrounding the carcass as it is scavenged and decomposes, where viable populations of vegetative B . anthracis and spores contaminate the environment. In many settings, necrophagous flies contaminate the outer carcass, surrounding soils, and vegetation with viable pathogen while scavenging. Field observations in Texas have confirmed this process and identified primary browse species (e.g., persimmon) are contaminated. However, there are limited data available on B . anthracis survival on environmental substrates immediately following host death at a LIZ. Toward this, we simulated fly contamination by inoculating live-attenuated, fully virulent laboratory-adapted, and fully virulent wild B . anthracis strains on untreated leaves and rocks for 2, 5, and 7 days. At each time point after inoculation, the number of vegetative cells and spores were determined. Sporulation rates were extracted from these different time points to enable comparison of sporulation speeds between B . anthracis strains with different natural histories. We found all B . anthracis strains used in this study could multiply for 2 or more days post inoculation and persist on leaves and rocks for at least seven days with variation by strain. We found differences in sporulation rates between laboratory-adapted strains and wild isolates, with the live-attenuated strain sporulating fastest, followed by the wild isolates, then laboratory-adapted virulent strains. Extrapolating our wild strain lab results to potential contamination, a single blow fly may contaminate leaves with up to 8.62 x 10 5 spores per day and a single carcass may host thousands of flies.

https://openalex.org/W4296809953,"The unexpected accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in Japan, which occurred on March 11th, 2011, after the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami struck the north-eastern coast of Japan, released radionuclides into the environment. Today, because of the amounts of radionuclides released and their relatively long half-life, the levels of radiocesium contaminating foodstuffs remain a significant food safety concern. Foodstuffs in Japan have been sampled and monitored for 134,137Cs since the accident. More than 2.5 million samples of foodstuffs have been examined with the results reported monthly during each Japanese fiscal year (FY, from April 1st to March 31st) from 2012 to 2021. A total of 5,695 samples of foodstuffs within the ""general foodstuffs"" category collected during this whole period and 13 foodstuffs within the ""drinking water including soft drinks containing tea as a raw material"" category sampled in FY 2012 were found to exceed the Japanese maximum permitted level (JML) set at 100 and 10 Bq/kg, respectively. No samples from the ""milk and infant foodstuffs"" category exceeded the JML (50 Bq/kg). The annual proportions of foodstuffs exceeding the JML in the ""general foodstuffs"" category varied between 0.37% and 2.57%, and were highest in FY 2012. The 134,137Cs concentration for more than 99% of the foodstuffs monitored and reported has been low and not exceeding the JML in recent years, except for those foodstuffs that are difficult to cultivate, feed or manage, such as wild mushrooms, plants, animals and fish. The monitoring data for foodstuffs show the current status of food safety risks from 134,137Cs contamination, particularly for cultured and aquaculture foodstuffs on the market in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W4296181128,"Melanosomes are melanin-containing organelles in melanocytes, and they are responsible for skin and hair pigmentation in mammals. The intracellular distribution of melanosomes is mainly determined by the balance between their anterograde transport on actin filaments and retrograde transport on microtubules. Although we have shown previously that melanoregulin and Rab36 serve as cargo receptors on melanosomes for retrograde transport, their knockdown does not completely inhibit retrograde melanosome transport, suggesting the existence of an additional cargo receptor(s) in melanocytes. In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of an atypical large Rab, Rab44, which also contains EF-hand domains and a coiled-coil domain, in retrograde melanosome transport in mouse melanocytes (Rab27A-deficient melan-ash cells). Our results showed that Rab44 localizes on mature melanosomes through lipidation of its C-terminal Rab-like GTPase domain, and that its knockdown results in suppression of retrograde melanosome transport. In addition, our biochemical analysis indicated that Rab44 interacts with the dynein–dynactin motor complex via its coiled-coil domain–containing middle region. Since simultaneous depletion of Rab44, melanoregulin, and Rab36 resulted in almost complete inhibition of retrograde melanosome transport, we propose that Rab44 is the third cargo receptor. We also showed that the N-terminal region of Rab44, which contains EF-hand domains, is required for both retrograde melanosome transport and its Ca2+-modulated activities.

Melanosomes are specialized melanin-containing lysosome-related organelles (so-called LROs) present in pigmented cells, including mammalian epidermal melanocytes (simply referred to as melanocytes later) (1Bowman S.L.

Because the melanin contained in melanosomes is black, melanosomes can be easily identified with a conventional light microscope, and melanosomes have often been used as a model of organelle transport in the past few decades (6Hume A.N.

Two distinct machineries of retrograde melanosome transport have previously been reported. The first machinery consists of melanoregulin (Mreg), Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), and a dynein–dynactin subunit p150Glued (19Ohbayashi N. Maruta Y. Ishida M. Fukuda M.

Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mreg was originally identified as a dilute suppressor (dsu) gene product whose deficiency results in the suppression of the coat color of dilute and ashen mice (12Moore K.J. Swing D.A. Rinchik E.M.

Mreg recruits the dynein–dynactin motor complex through RILP, and its knockdown in ashen-derived melanocytes (melan-ash cells) (23Ali B.R. Wasmeier C. Lamoreux L. Strom M. Seabra M.C. Multiple regions contribute to membrane targeting of Rab GTPases.J.

Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The second machinery consists of a protein complex that shares the RILP and p150Glued of the first machinery but uses Rab36 instead of Mreg as a cargo receptor on melanosomes (20Matsui T. Ohbayashi N. Fukuda M. The Rab interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) homology domain functions as a novel effector domain for small GTPase Rab36: Rab36 regulates retrograde melanosome transport in melanocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 28619-28631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, since depletion of both Mreg and Rab36 in melan-ash cells does not completely inhibit retrograde melanosome transport (20Matsui T. Ohbayashi N. Fukuda M. The Rab interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) homology domain functions as a novel effector domain for small GTPase Rab36: Rab36 regulates retrograde melanosome transport in melanocytes.J. Biol.

Rab44 and Rab45 (also known as Rasef) are atypical Rab family members (called large Rabs) that are characterized by containing EF-hand domains and a coiled-coil (CC) domain in the N-terminal region in addition to the C-terminal Rab-like GTPase domain (24Srikanth S.

It has recently been reported that Rab44 regulates the exocytosis of mast cell granules (a kind of LRO) and lysosomes (27Kadowaki T. Yamaguchi Y. Kido M.A. Abe T. Ogawa K.

Rab44 isoforms similarly promote lysosomal exocytosis, but exhibit differential localization in mast cells.FEBS Open Bio. 2021; 11: 1165-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and that Rab45 is involved in endocytic trafficking through interaction with the dynein–dynactin motor complex (29Wang Y. Huynh W. Skokan T.D. Lu W. Weiss A. Vale R.D. CRACR2a is a calcium-activated dynein adaptor protein that regulates endocytic traffic.J.

Sci. 2020; 45: 440-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the role of large Rabs in melanosome transport in melanocytes. In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of large Rabs in melanosome distribution and found that knockdown of Rab44 in melan-ash cells restored the peripheral melanosome distribution but that knockdown of Rab45 did not. We also showed by coimmunoprecipitation assays that Rab44 interacts with p150Glued via the CC domain–containing middle region and that its interaction is slightly enhanced by 10 μM Ca2+. Moreover, simultaneous knockdown of Rab44, Mreg, and Rab36 in melan-ash cells almost completely inhibited retrograde melanosome transport, indicating that Rab44 is a third, and presumably the last, Ca2+-modulated–type cargo receptor for the dynein–dynactin complex on melanosomes. To evaluate the possible involvement of the large Rabs Rab44 and Rab45 in retrograde melanosome transport, we turned our attention to Rab27A-deficient melan-ash cells (23Ali B.R. Wasmeier C. Lamoreux L. Strom M. Seabra M.C. Multiple regions contribute to membrane targeting of Rab GTPases.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6401-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whose melanosomes are aggregated around the nucleus because of increased retrograde melanosome transport activity. Consistent with our previous studies (19Ohbayashi N. Maruta Y. Ishida M. Fukuda M. Melanoregulin regulates retrograde melanosome transport through interaction with the RILP–p150Glued complex in melanocytes.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Matsui T. Ohbayashi N. Fukuda M. The Rab interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) homology domain functions as a novel effector domain for small GTPase Rab36: Rab36 regulates retrograde melanosome transport in melanocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 28619-28631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), knockdown of either Mreg, Rab36, or both in melan-ash cells resulted in the dispersion of melanosomes from the perinucleus to the cell periphery (Fig. S1A, red asterisks), although ∼30% of the cells still exhibited a perinuclear melanosome aggregation phenotype (Fig. S1B). This phenotype was most unlikely to be attributable to insufficient knockdown of Mreg, Rab36, or both, because both Mreg and Rab36 proteins in melan-ash cells mostly disappeared under our experimental conditions (Fig. S1C). Moreover, the observed phenotype was completely rescued by re-expression of an siRNA-resistant (SR) form of Mreg or Rab36, excluding the possibility of an off-target effect of siRNAs (Fig. S1, D–F). To identify the remaining cargo receptor(s) on melanosomes for retrograde melanosome transport, we designed three independent siRNAs specific for Rab44 and Rab45 (named siRab44#1–3 and siRab45#1–3, respectively) and knocked down endogenous Rab44 or Rab45 in melan-ash cells. Because of unavailability of specific antibodies that worked in melan-ash cells, we were unable to detect endogenous Rab44 and Rab45 proteins under our experimental conditions (data not shown), and instead knockdown efficiency of siRNAs was evaluated by an RT–PCR analysis (Fig. 1B). The results showed that knockdown of Rab44 by siRab44#2 and #3 significantly increased the number of cells showing peripheral melanosome distribution (red asterisks in Fig. 1C), although ∼40% of the transfected cells still exhibited the perinuclear melanosome aggregation phenotype (Fig. 1D). By contrast, neither siRab44#1 nor siRab45#1–3 had any effect on the perinuclear melanosome distribution in melan-ash cells (Fig. 1, C and D). The absence of any effect of siRab44#1 on perinuclear melanosome aggregation was attributable to the insufficient knockdown of Rab44 mRNA as revealed by an RT–PCR analysis (Fig. 1B, lane 2). We also investigated the effect of Rab44 knockdown (i.e., knockdown with siRab44#3) on the melanosome distribution of normal melanocytes (i.e., black mouse–derived melan-a cells) (31Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Hart I.R. A line of non-tumorigenic mouse melanocytes, syngeneic with the B16 melanoma and requiring a tumour promoter for growth.Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), but, the same as Mreg knockdown in melan-a cells in our previous study (19Ohbayashi N. Maruta Y. Ishida M. Fukuda M. Melanoregulin regulates retrograde melanosome transport through interaction with the RILP–p150Glued complex in melanocytes.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it had no effect on peripheral melanosome distribution (Fig. S1G). To rule out the possibility that the observed effect of Rab44 knockdown was simply attributable to an off-target effect of siRNAs, we performed a rescue experiment using an SR Rab44 mutant (Rab44SR) (Fig. S2A). Re-expression of enhanced GFP (EGFP)-tagged Rab44SR in siRab44#3-treated melan-ash cells was followed by suppression of the peripheral dispersion of melanosomes in Rab44-depleted cells (Fig. 2A), and the percentage of cells exhibiting peripheral melanosome dispersion was significantly decreased in cells expressing EGFP-Rab44SR in comparison with the control cells expressing EGFP alone (Fig. 2B). To analyze the knockdown phenotype in greater detail, we used peripheral melanosome dispersion calculated by the formula shown in Figure 2C to quantify the peripheral melanosome dispersion of single cells more accurately. Application of this formula to the melanosome distribution in melan-a cells (with predominantly peripheral melanosome distribution) and melan-ash cells (with predominantly perinuclear melanosome distribution) (Fig. 2C, left images) revealed a significant difference between the two groups (Fig. 2C, right graph). The formula was used to calculate the peripheral melanosome dispersion of each cell shown in Figure 2A, and the values obtained in the three groups were subjected to a statistical analysis. As shown in Figure 2D, the greater peripheral melanosome dispersion of the Rab44-depleted cells was significantly reduced after re-expression of EGFP-Rab44SR to a level similar to the level in the control siRNA-treated cells. Taken together, these results pointed to Rab44 as a likely candidate for an additional cargo receptor for retrograde melanosome transport. If Rab44 functions as a cargo receptor for retrograde melanosome transport, it should be localized on mature melanosomes. To identify the subcellular localization of Rab44 in melanocytes, we transiently expressed EGFP-Rab44 in melan-a cells. As expected, Rab44 colocalized with the mature melanosomes in the cell periphery (Fig. 3A, inset in the bottom right panel). Some of the EGFP-Rab44 was also colocalized with LAMP1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1)-positive lysosomes (Fig. 3B, inset in the bottom right panel) as reported previously (28Kadowaki T. Yamaguchi Y. Ogawa K. Tokuhisa M. Okamoto K. Tsukuba T. Rab44 isoforms similarly promote lysosomal exocytosis, but exhibit differential localization in mast cells.FEBS Open Bio. 2021; 11: 1165-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Since Rab44 is a GTPase, we then investigated whether the Rab44 localized on melanosomes in an active state or an inactive state by preparing constitutively active (CA; Q844L) and constitutively negative (T799N) mutants and transiently expressing them in melan-a cells. The results showed that only the CA mutant colocalized with melanosomes, the same as the WT protein (Fig. 3C, insets in the bottom panels), although neither mutant had any effect on melanosome distribution (Fig. 3C, top panels). Thus, Rab44 is likely to localize on mature melanosomes in a GTP-dependent manner. To identify the region responsible for the melanosomal localization of Rab44, we created three truncated mutants of Rab44, Rab44-EF, which contains an N-terminal EF-hand domain, Rab44-MID (middle domain), which contains a CC domain, and Rab44-RAB, which contains a C-terminal Rab-like GTPase domain (Fig. 4A). We transiently expressed these mutants with EGFP tag in melan-a cells and investigated their localizations. The results showed that only the Rab44-RAB mutant colocalized with melanosomes (Fig. 4B, insets in the bottom row of the left panels), whereas the other mutants appeared to be present in the cytoplasm. In general, conventional Rab proteins localize on organelle membranes via their C-terminal lipidation (i.e., geranylgeranylation) (32Leung K.F. Baron R. Seabra M.C. Thematic review series: lipid posttranslational modifications. geranylgeranylation of Rab GTPases.J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and Rab44 itself has been reported to localize on lysosomes via C-terminal lipidation (33Tokuhisa M. Kadowaki T. Ogawa K. Yamaguchi Y. Kido M.A. Gao W. et al.Expression and localisation of Rab44 in immune-related cells change during cell differentiation and stimulation.Sci. Rep. 2020; 1010728Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, Rab44 should also localize on melanosomes by the same mechanism, and an additional Rab44 point mutant (named Rab44-RAB(C971A/C972A)), which lacks C-terminal lipidation sites, actually failed to exhibit melanosomal localization (Fig. 4B, insets in the right panels). Since knockdown of Rab44 in melan-ash cells restored peripheral melanosome distribution (Figs. 1D and 2D), we hypothesized that Rab44 is involved in retrograde melanosome transport on microtubules. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the interaction between Rab44 and p150Glued (also known as dynactin 1), a component of the dynein–dynactin complex, which generally regulates microtubule-dependent retrograde transport, by performing coimmunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells. The results showed that FLAG-tagged Rab44, but not an unrelated control protein (glutathione-S-transferase [GST]), interacted with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged p150Glued (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, Rab44 expressed in B16-F1 melanoma cells was found to interact with both endogenous p150Glued and the endogenous dynein heavy chain (Fig. 5B). We then attempted to determine the mechanism by which Rab44 interacts with the dynein–dynactin complex by performing coimmunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells with the three Rab44 truncated mutants described previously (Fig. 4A). The results showed that Rab44-MID, not Rab44-EF or Rab44-RAB, interacted with p150Glued (Fig. 5C). The interaction between Rab44 and p150Glued appeared to be direct because HA-tagged p150Glued purified with HA affinity beads was able to bind to purified GST-Rab44-MID, not to GST alone (asterisks in Fig. 5, D and E), although under our experimental conditions, p150Glued was copurified with Arp1, a known dynactin component (34Reck-Peterson S.L.

Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 382-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) (# in Fig. 5E). Taken together, these results suggested that Rab44 interacts with the dynein–dynactin complex through its CC domain–containing middle region. To determine whether Rab44 functions as a remaining cargo receptor for retrograde melanosome transport in the absence of both Mreg and Rab36, we knocked down all three molecules in melan-ash cells by using specific siRNAs (Fig. S2, B and C). As expected, triple knockdown of Rab44, Mreg, and Rab36 resulted in more melanosome dispersion to the cell periphery than double knockdown of Rab44 and Mreg or knockdown of Rab44 alone did (Fig. 6, A and B). We especially noted the fact that the peripheral melanosome dispersion in the triple knockdown melan-ash cells (64.0 ± 8.1%) was comparable to that of the melan-a cells, which exhibit normal peripheral melanosome distribution (Fig. 2C, right graph, 72.7 ± 9.4%), indicating that Rab44, Mreg, and Rab36 are sufficient to mediate retrograde melanosome transport in melanocytes. Since melanocyte morphology is not uniform, thereby precluding direct comparisons between melanosome distribution in cells of different shapes, we adopted the cell normalization technology previously established by using micropatterns (disc shape)-printed glass coverslips (35Evans R.D. Robinson C. Briggs D.A. Tooth D.J. Ramalho J.S. Cantero M. et al.Myosin-Va and dynamic actin oppose microtubules to drive long-range organelle transport.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 1743-1750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to quantitatively investigate the melanosome distribution of Rab44-depleted cells in greater detail. When control melan-ash cells were seeded on disc-shaped–printed glass coverslips, all of them assumed a circular shape along the micropattern without any change in their perinuclear melanosome aggregation phenotype (Fig. 6C, far left columns). Intriguingly, single knockdown (Rab44 alone), double knockdown (Rab44 and Mreg), and triple knockdown (Rab44, Mreg, and Rab36) resulted in stepwise increases in melanosome dispersion to the cell periphery (Fig. 6C, right three columns). The radial profile plot of melanosomes in the knockdown cells and control cells showed that much greater melanosomes disperse in the triple knockdown cells than in the control cells (Fig. 6D, compare the red and black lines). Moreover, the pigment dispersion distance (PDD) of each cell shown in Figure 6C (defined as the distance from the center of the circle containing 95% of the total signal intensity of intracellular melanosomes) confirmed stepwise and significant increases in melanosome dispersion to the cell periphery (Fig. 6E).

Regulatory mechanisms underlying pluripotency in progenitors, such as the ability of lymphoid progenitor cells to differentiate into T-lineage, remain unclear. We have previously reported that LIM domain only 2 (Lmo2), a bridging factor in large transcriptional complexes, is essential to retain the ability of lymphoid progenitors to differentiate into T-lineage. However, biochemical characterization of Lmo2 protein complexes in physiological hematopoietic progenitors remains obscure. Here, we identified approximately 600 Lmo2-interacting molecules in a lymphoid progenitor cell line by two-step affinity purification with LC-MS/MS analysis. Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 1 (Zbtb1) and CBFA2/RUNX1 partner transcriptional corepressor 3 (Cbfa2t3) were found to be the functionally important binding partners of Lmo2. We determined CRISPR/Cas9-mediated acute disruption of Zbtb1 or Cbfa2t3 in the lymphoid progenitor or bone marrow-derived primary hematopoietic progenitor cells causes significant defects in the initiation of T-cell development when Notch signaling is activated. Our transcriptome analysis of Zbtb1- or Cbfa2t3-deficient lymphoid progenitors revealed that Tcf7 was a common target for both factors. Additionally, ChIP-seq analysis showed that Lmo2, Zbtb1, and Cbfa2t3 cobind to the Tcf7 upstream enhancer region, which is occupied by the Notch intracellular domain/RBPJ transcriptional complex after Notch stimulation, in lymphoid progenitors. Moreover, transduction with Tcf7 restored the defect in the T-lineage potential of Zbtb1-deficient lymphoid progenitors. Thus, in lymphoid progenitors, the Lmo2/Zbtb1/Cbfa2t3 complex directly binds to the Tcf7 locus and maintains responsiveness to the Notch-mediated inductive signaling to facilitate T-lineage differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4296545298,"Objectives This study examined the association between perceived manageability of debt and risk of depression, anxiety, and mental health help-seeking among a nationally representative sample of adults living in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods Data was derived from the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study Wave 6 (August/September 2021) which examined the psychological, social, and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK adult population. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between different levels of perceived debt manageability (i.e., “easily manageable”, “some problems”, “quite serious problems”, “very serious problems”, “cannot manage at all”) and mental health related outcomes. Results Almost a quarter of the sample (24%, n = 494) reported debt management problems, and debt manageability associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, and mental health help-seeking. After adjusting for demographic variables (e.g. income, receipt of benefits), logistic regression analysis demonstrated a dose-response association between increasing levels of debt manageability problems and mental health outcomes. Specifically, adjusted odds ratios for anxiety ranged from 2.28 (‘some problems’) to 11.18 (‘very serious problems’), for depression ranged from 2.80 (‘some problems’) to 16.21 (‘cannot manage at all’), and for mental health help-seeking ranged from 1.69 (‘some problems’) to 3.18 (‘quite serious problems’, ‘very serious problems’). Conclusion This study highlights that debt manageability problems represent a robust predictor of depression, anxiety, and mental-health help seeking."
https://openalex.org/W4296545335,"In the last century, Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB) destroyed the banana cultivar Gros Michel. The Cavendish cultivars saved the global banana industry, and currently they dominate global production (~50%) and the export trade (~95%). However, a new strain called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) surfaced in the late 1960’s, spread globally and greatly damages Cavendish plantations as well as manifold local varieties that are primarily grown by small holders. Presently, there is no commercially available replacement for Cavendish and hence control strategies must be developed and implemented to manage FWB. Here, we studied whether it is possible to induce resistance to TR4 by pre-inoculations with different Fusarium spp. Only pre-treatments with an avirulent Race 1 strain significantly reduced disease development of TR4 in a Cavendish genotype and this effect was stable at various nutritional and pH conditions. We then used transcriptome analysis to study the molecular basis of this response. Several genes involved in plant defence responses were up-regulated during the initial stages of individual infections with TR4 and Race 1, as well as in combined treatments. In addition, a number of genes in the ethylene and jasmonate response pathways as well as several gibberellin synthesis associated genes were induced. We observed upregulation of RGA2 like genes in all treatments. Hence, RGA2 could be a key factor involved in both R1 and TR4 resistance. The data support the hypothesis that activating resistance to Race 1 in Cavendish bananas affects TR4 development and provide a first insight of gene expression during the interaction between various Fusarium spp. and banana."

The prevention of VAW and intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) has become a priority within this context, and includes various prevention strategies such as social participation and helping behaviors. In different countries, conducting research on help-seeking behavior and bystander intervention in cases of VAW is a common practice, but addressing these issues is much less common in Spain. In this context, the objective of this study is to provide a preliminary estimation of the volume of bystanders in cases of IPVAW in Spain between 2005 and 2020 (since the entry into force of Organic Law 1/2004), their willingness to intervene and, in the case of intervention, the type of helping behavior (real or hypothetical) preferred, using the sources (secondary data) available (specifically, survey data, as the surveys of social perception of gender violence and the 2014 and 2019 macro-surveys, and also administrative data, as the database of reports filed). The data analyzed allow us to determine that, in fact, in the cases of IPVAW there are usually persons within the victim's inner circle who are firsthand witnesses or have been informed by the victim of the existence of this type of violence, but, although the bystanders generally claim they would engage in an active and supportive response, this is in fact not always the case. These results underscore the need to develop intervention programs aimed at IPVAW bystanders to improve their reaction and contribute to the development of helpful and efficient active responses."

Tubular injury has drawn increased attention because sodium wasting is common in hospitalized HIV/AIDS patients. We used viral protein R (Vpr)-transgenic mice to investigate the mechanisms whereby Vpr contributes to urinary sodium wasting. In phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter-driven Vpr-transgenic mice, in situ hybridization showed that Vpr mRNA was expressed in all nephron segments, including the distal convoluted tubule. Vpr-transgenic mice, compared with wild-type littermates, markedly increased urinary sodium excretion, despite similar plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels. Kidneys from Vpr-transgenic mice also markedly reduced protein abundance of the Na + -Cl - cotransporter (NCC), while mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) protein expression level was unchanged. In African green monkey kidney cells, Vpr abrogated the aldosterone-mediated stimulation of MR transcriptional activity. Gene expression of Slc12a3 (NCC) in Vpr-transgenic mice was significantly lower compared with wild-type mice, assessed by both qRT-PCR and RNAScope in situ hybridization analysis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified multiple MR response elements (MRE), located from 5 kb upstream of the transcription start site and extending to the third exon of the SLC12A3 gene. Mutation of MRE and SP1 sites in the SLC12A3 promoter region abrogated the transcriptional responses to aldosterone and Vpr, indicating that functional MRE and SP1 are required for the SLC12A3 gene suppression in response to Vpr. Thus, Vpr attenuates MR transcriptional activity and inhibits Slc12a3 transcription in the distal convoluted tubule and contributes to salt wasting in Vpr-transgenic mice."

They can aid consumers with low dietary intake and quality, as well as those with high demands, by boosting nutritious value. A cross-sectional study was conducted among adults living in Saudi Arabia aged between 18–60 years old using online self-administered questionnaire. Information regarding sociodemographic characteristics, use and type of dietary supplements, and attitude toward and patterns of dietary supplement use was collected. The chi-square test, Pearson correlations, and the independent t-test were used. In total, 531 participants (115 men and 416 women) were included. Approximately half of the participants (51.8%, n = 275) used dietary supplements. Participants who were using dietary supplements were significantly younger (29.16 ± 9.32 years), more highly educated (85.5%, n = 235), and worked in the health sector (63.7%, n = 100). Herbal supplement use was associated with older age and female sex. Single mineral supplements were used more frequently by married, female, pregnant, or breastfeeding participants and those not working in the health sector. Fatty supplements were used more frequently by participants with a higher level of education. Regarding the attitude toward dietary supplement use, women, single participants, and health care workers showed a significant positive attitude. In-depth investigation into the amount of and reasons for dietary supplement use in the health sector is required. Additionally, educating pregnant and breastfeeding women on the importance of dietary supplements is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4296807751,"The Iberian ibex is one of the most singular species of the Iberian Peninsula. Throughout the years, this species suffered several threats which led the population to its decline. Many reintroductions and translocations were made, however, none of those actions took into account the genetic patterns of both reintroduced individuals and the target populations. In this paper, we explored the genetic traits of three populations of Iberian ibex in Catalonia, which experienced blind reintroductions in past years: The populations of Iberian ibex from Els Ports de Tortosa i Beseit National Game Reserve (TBNGR), Montserrat Natural Park (Monserrat) and Montgrí, les Illes Medes i el Baix Ter Natural Park (Montgrí) Based on the genetic patterns of the three populations coupled with the absence of genetic introgression with domestic goats-inferred using mitochondrial and nuclear markers-we propose that these should be regarded as two different management units: TBNGR coupled with Montserrat, and Montgrí. Montserrat population should be targeted as a population model for ecology and evolution studies. Although we did not detect evidences of recent bottleneck events, this population seems to be monomorphic for the mtDNA haplotype. Our results suggest that the blind reintroductions from TBNGR to Montserrat failed on maximizing the genetic diversity of the latter. We enhance the importance of genetic monitoring of both the source population and the selected individuals to be re-introduced. We conclude that the three studied population of Iberian ibex must be monitored to explore which strategy would be advantageous for maintaining the genetic diversity. On the other hand, TBNGR should be monitored to assess the existence of its singular genetic variation, where stochastic events could preserve this lost genetic variation."

So far, the ChaC family proteins in trypanosomal parasites are missing in the literature. Here, we report two members of the ChaC family of γ-glutamyl cyclotransferases (LmChaC2a and LmChaC2b) in the unicellular pathogen Leishmania. Activity measurements suggest that these proteins catalyze degradation of GSH but no other γ-glutamyl peptides. Recombinant LmChaC2a protein shows ∼17-fold lower catalytic efficiency (kcat ∼ 0.9 s−1) than LmChaC2b (kcat ∼ 15 s−1), although they showed comparable Km values (∼1.75 mM for LmChaC2a and ∼2.0 mM for LmChaC2b) toward GSH. qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses suggest that the LmChaC2a protein was found to be constitutively expressed, whereas LmChaC2b was regulated by sulfur stress. To investigate its precise physiological function in Leishmania, we generated overexpressed, knockout, and complement cell lines. Flow cytometric analyses show the presence of a higher intracellular GSH concentration and lower intracellular ROS level, indicative of a more reductive environment in null mutants. We found LmChaC2-expressing cells grow in GSH-containing sulfur-limited media, while the null mutants failed to grow, suggesting that LmChaC2 is crucial for cell growth with GSH as the only sulfur source. Null mutants, although reach the stationary phase rapidly, display impaired long-term survival, indicating that LmChaC2-mediated GSH degradation is necessary for prolonged survival.

Generally, GSH displays extreme diverse roles in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells including mitochondrial iron-sulfur biogenesis (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Glutathione.Annu. Rev.

In addition, GSH also regulates immune cell functions, like initiating the Th1 or Th2 immune responses by controlling the antigen-processing machinery in antigen-presenting cells (5Peterson J.D.

Apoptosis and glutathione: beyond an antioxidant.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and low GSH concentration, are closely associated with several diseases (7Townsend D.M.

Protozoan parasites, trypanosomatids, have several unique features; one of them is trypanothione [T(SH)2] based redox metabolism. A massive amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is produced by activated macrophages as initial line of defense against the parasites (13Nathan C. Shiloh M.U.

The activity of ChaC protein toward the reduced form of GSH involves the cleavage of γ-glutamyl bond of GSH with subsequent production of 5-oxoproline and Cys-Gly (24Kumar C. Igbaria A. D’Autreaux B.

Two ChaC homologs, ChaC1 and ChaC2, are found in higher eukaryotes, where constitutively expressed ChaC2 protein displays ∼10 to 20 times reduced catalytic efficiency compared to inducibly expressed ChaC1 protein (27Kaur A.

In this article, we characterize the two ChaC proteins from L. major (LmChaC2a and LmChaC2b), which catalyze the γ-glutamyl bond cleavage of the GSH to produce Cys-Gly and 5-oxoproline. Surprisingly, our data revealed that the LmChaC2b (larger protein) showed ∼17 fold more catalytic activity compared to the LmChaC2a (smaller protein). Although LmChaC2b protein expression was significantly increased in sulfur-limited media and stationary phase culture, LmChaC2a protein is constitutively expressed. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that the growth rate of null mutants is very high but they display impaired long-term survival in the aged culture and reduced pathogenicity in macrophage and BALB/c mice. Two putative LmChaC sequences in tandem array (systematic name: LmjF.22.1190 and LmjF.22.1200) within L. major genome database (https://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/app) have been identified as ORF, comprising of 237 and 323 residues, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the shorter version (237 amino acids) and the longer version of putative LmChaC proteins (323 amino acids) bear 32% and 35% identity with the human ChaC1, respectively (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the shorter version and the longer version of putative LmChaC protein have about 40% and 45% identity with the human ChaC2, respectively (Fig. 1). Signature YGSL/I motif and catalytic glutamate residue were present in both genes, confirming that both proteins belong to the ChaC family of γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase proteins. As higher sequence identity is observed with human ChaC2 protein, we have denoted the shorter version (237 amino acids) as LmChaC2a and the longer version (323 amino acids) as LmChaC2b. To identify the biochemical properties of LmChaC2a and LmChaC2b proteins, both the full length proteins were expressed in E. coli cells. Purified LmChaC2b and LmChaC2a proteins migrated to positions in the gel as predicted by theoretical relative molecular weight of 38 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 4) and 28 kDa protein (Fig. 2A, lane 9), respectively. Products of the assay mixture were identified by HPLC after the enzymatic reaction of these LmChaC2 family proteins on GSH. When these proteins are present in assay mixture, peaks of GSH disappeared and new peaks for 5-oxoproline and Cys-Gly dipeptide emerged (Fig. 2B). Production of 5-oxoproline from GSH degradation confirmed the γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase activity of the LmChaC family proteins. Both LmChaC2a and LmChaC2b proteins follow standard Michaelis–Menten kinetics with respect to the substrate (GSH) (Figs. 2C and S1). The Km values for GSH were very similar between LmChaC2a and LmChaC2b proteins: 1.75 ± 0.08 mM for LmChaC2a and 2.0 ± 0.15 mM for LmChaC2b. These Km values were comparable with human as well as mouse ChaC protein (27Kaur A. Gautam R. Srivastava R. Chandel A. Kumar A. Karthikeyan S. et al.ChaC2, an enzyme for slow turnover of cytosolic glutathione.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 638-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our experimental Km value of recombinant LmChaC2 proteins is high with respect to intracellular concentration of GSH (0.21 mM in promastigotes and 0.39 mM in amastigotes stage (28Krauth-Siegel R.L. Comini M.A. Redox control in trypanosomatids, parasitic protozoa with trypanothione-based thiol metabolism.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 1236-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)). One possible reason is that either the Km value of natural LmChaC2 within intracellular environment might be lower compared to experimental value of recombinant protein or the previous determinations of intracellular GSH concentrations may not be sufficiently reliable. Although Km of both proteins are similar but LmChaC2a proteins show ∼17-fold lower catalytic efficiency (kcat = 0.9 ± 0.1 s−1) than LmChaC2b (kcat = 15 ± 1.8 s−1). To evaluate the relative activities of the LmChaC2 proteins toward different γ-Glu-dipeptides, T(SH)2, and GSSG, we estimated their γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase activity by measuring the 5-oxoproline concentration (Figs. 2D and S2). The results showed that both enzymes showed activity toward GSH (Fig. 2B) but no activity toward the other γ-Glu-amino acids as well as GSSG and T(SH)2 (Figs. 2D and S2). These results suggest that both LmChaC2 proteins serve as γ-glutamyl cyclotransferases acting specifically on GSH degradation but no other γ-glutamyl peptides. Earlier researchers have reported that the human ChaC1 expression was induced by ER stress or sulfur starvation, whereas human ChaC2 was constitutively expressed (25Mungrue I.N. Pagnon J. Kohannim O. Gargalovic P.S. Lusis A.J. CHAC1/MGC4504 is a novel proapoptotic component of the unfolded protein response, downstream of the ATF4-ATF3-CHOP cascade.J.

Karthikeyan S. et al.ChaC2, an enzyme for slow turnover of cytosolic glutathione.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 638-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To identify whether GSH degrading enzymes, LmChaC2a and LmChaC2b, are constitutively or inducibly expressed in the parasite, we performed semi–quantitative real-time PCR (sqRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses. The results suggested that both the LmChaC2a and the LmChaC2b were expressed in the promastigote as well as the amastigote stages (Fig. 3, A and B). qRT-PCR analysis data suggested that LmChaC2b expression does not change significantly during the log phase of growth but increases 1.5 times during stationary phase with or without treatment with acidic pH 5.6 (Fig. 3C). However, treatments with neither tunicamycin (ER stress-inducing agent) nor H2O2 (oxidative stress inducer) could significantly influence the expression of either of the proteins (Fig. 3D). The breakdown of GSH also provides sulfur for the cells. Therefore, we used qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis to investigate the effect of sulfur-limited media on the expression of LmChaC2a and LmChaC2b (Fig. 3, E and F). We found that LmChaC2b transcription was significantly increased (3.5-fold) in sulfur-limited media up to 48 h (Fig. 3E), but after 48 h, the level of LmChaC2b started decreasing (data not shown), which might be caused by a decrease in cell viability. On the other hand, there was no significant change in the mRNA levels of LmChaC2a. We also assessed the protein expression levels by using Western blot technique where LmChaC2b expression increased significantly at 48 h incubation in sulfur-limited media but LmChaC2a level remained constant (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that LmChaC2a protein was constitutively expressed, whereas LmChaC2b was controlled by sulfur stress. To investigate the LmChaC2a and LmChaC2b function in L. major, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique was used (Fig. 4A) to knock the genes out. PCR analysis from genomic DNA (gDNA) and Western blotting confirmed that null mutant cells (KO) no longer expressed LmChaC2a or LmChaC2b gene (Fig. 4, B and C). The OE2a and OE2b cell lines expressed higher amounts of LmChaC2a and LmChaC2b proteins compared to CT cell line, respectively. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the CM2a cell line expressed only LmChaC2a protein, whereas CM2b cell line expressed only LmChaC2b protein. The double complemented (CM) leishmanial cell lines expressed both the proteins in amounts comparable to control cells. Next, we investigated whether the levels of intracellular GSH and T(SH)2 were changed in the OE2a, OE2b, KO, CM2a, and CM2b cells compared to CT and CM cells (Figs. 4D and S3). HPLC analysis suggested that KO cells had ∼2- and ∼4-fold higher intracellular GSH and T(SH)2 content compared to CT cells, respectively. Flow cytometry results confirmed that KO cells had higher amount of intracellular GSH (Fig. 4E) compared to CT, OE2a, OE2b, CM2a, CM2b, or CM cell lines. As expected, the order of intracellular GSH accumulation was KO > CM2a > CM2b > CT or CM > OE2a > OE2b cells. Depletion of cellular GSH and T(SH)2 often leads to an increased level of ROS within the cell. To evaluate the intracellular ROS concentration in CT, OE2a, OE2b, KO, CM2a, CM2b, and CM late log phase cell lines, we used DCFDA (fluorescent probe). The intracellular ROS level in the KO population was lower compared to the CT, OE2a, OE2b, CM2a, CM2b, and CM cells, indicating that the LmChaC2 proteins were able to enhance the endogenous ROS generation by degradation of GSH in the Leishmania parasite (Fig. 5A). The importance of intracellular ROS in maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is now widely acknowledged. We measured intracellular Ca2+ levels in OE2a, OE2b, CT, KO, CM2a, CM2b, and CM cell lines by flow cytometry assay using the calcium sensor, Fluo 4AM dye (Fig. 5B). The intensity of the green fluorescence of Fluo 4AM dye for the KO cells was at least two folds lower than that in the CT cells, suggesting that deletion of LmChaC2 genes protected the cells against oxidative stress–mediated increase of cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 5B). The order of elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation was KO < CM2a < CM2b < CT or CM < OE2a < OE2b cells. Cell death can result from disruption of ROS homeostasis and an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. To investigate whether depletion of LmChaC2a and LmChaC2b genes shielded against oxidative stress–induced cell death, we compared the percentage of viable (propidium iodide [PI] negative) parasites among OE2a, OE2b, CT, KO, CM2a, CM2b, and CM late log phase cell lines by flow cytometry assay using the PI dye (Fig. 5C). Flow cytometry data revealed that the majority of the null mutant parasite population was PI negative (Fig. 5C), while higher amount of PI positive cells was found in the OE population, where excess amounts of LmChaC2 proteins had resulted in reduced amount of GSH. These results suggested that deletion of LmChaC2 genes protected cells against cell death at late log phase cell lines. We next tested whether deletion of LmChaC2 proteins inhibits the oxidative stress–induced cell differentiation from procyclic (noninfective stage) to nondividing metacyclic (infective stage) promastigotes. By negative agglutination reaction with peanut agglutinin (PNA), we were able to isolate metacyclic promastigotes from OE2a, OE2b, CT, KO, CM2a, CM2b, and CM late log phase cell cultures (PNA). While procyclic parasites readily agglutinate, metacyclic promastigotes, due to developmental changes in terminally exposed oligosaccharides on the lipophosphoglycan, do not interact with peanut agglutinin (PNA-) (29Sacks D.L. Perkins P.V. Identification of an infective stage of Leishmania promastigotes.Science. 1984; 223: 1417-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a quantitative analysis of PNA agglutination by flow cytometry revealed that KO cell population consisted of lower metacyclic (PNA-) parasites compared to OE2a, OE2b, CT, CM2a, CM2b, or CM cells (Fig. 5D). These results strongly suggested that deletion of LmChaC2 genes prevent the cell differentiation from procyclic (noninfective stage) to metacyclic (infective stage) promastigote cells. The upregulation of antioxidant gene, ascorbate peroxidase (LmAPX), in the Leishmania parasite by oxidative stress has been reported (30Dolai S. Yadav R.K. Pal S. Adak S. Leishmania major ascorbate peroxidase overexpression protects cells against reactive oxygen species-mediated cardiolipin oxidation.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 1520-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that LmAPX gene expression in parasite was downregulated by reductive environment, we performed qRT-PCR and Western blot to measure LmAPX in KO, OE2a, OE2b, CT, CM2a, CM2b, and CM cells. qRT-PCR results suggested a lower expression of LmAPX (2-fold) mRNA in null mutants compared to CT or CM cells (Fig. 5E). The order of ascorbate peroxidase expression was KO < CM2a < CM2b < CT or CM < OE2a < OE2b cells. Western blot analysis was performed (Fig. 5, F and G) to further validate these data, and the results were remarkably similar to qRT-PCR data. Altogether, these results indicated that LmAPX was repressed under reducing environment. The intracellular thiols were increased by providing extracellular GSH in Leishmania infantum (31Mukherjee A. Roy G. Guimond C. Ouellette M. The gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase gene of Leishmania is essential and involved in response to oxidants.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 74: 914-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and GSH supplementation rescued an RNAi knockdown of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase in Trypanosoma brucei (32Huynh T.T. Huynh V.T. Harmon M.A. Phillips M.A. Gene knockdown of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase by RNAi in the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma brucei demonstrates that it is an essential enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39794-39800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that GSH transporter is present in this type of parasite. To investigate whether growth of null mutants in sulfur-limited media is affected by absence or presence of external GSH, growth curve analysis was performed. As expected, the growth curves showed that none of cell lines could grow in sulfur-limited media (Fig. 6A). While the KO population could not grow in GSH-containing sulfur-limited media, the OE2a, OE2b, CT, CM2a, CM2b, or CM cell line expressing ChaC family proteins grew very efficiently in presence of extracellular GSH (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that ChaC family protein in Leishmania helps to grow when GSH was used as the only sulfur source. Next, we examined whether null mutants can grow in N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) containing sulfur-limited media. Interestingly, it was observed that null mutants were able to grow in NAC containing sulfur-limited media (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that the KO cell can synthesize de novo GSH, T(SH)2, and other sulfur containing amino acid when NAC was used as the sulfur source. To investigate the role of ChaC2 proteins in the parasite, Leishmania were grown in normal nutrient-rich media. KO and CM2a cells had higher growth rates compared to OE2a, OE2b, CT, CM2b, or CM promastigotes (Fig. 6D). KO cells were grown faster but the parasite could not survive for longer time in the aged culture media compared to OE2b, CT, CM2b, or CM cell lines. These results indicate that LmChaC2b protein is required for long-time survival under unfavorable growth condition. According to flow cytometry (Fig. 6E) studies, KO cells contained 4-fold (75%) more dead cells (PI-positive cells) than CT (18%) or CM (20%) cells at late stationary phase culture. These results provide an explanation why the growth rate of KO cell was declined rapidly compared to CT cells. L. major cells, after infection, grow in host macrophage cells; therefore, we concentrated on the infectivity rate of Leishmania promastigotes with the macrophages. We examined to what extent OE2a, OE2b, CT, KO, CM2a, CM2b, and CM cells were phagocytosed by the host cells (macrophages). The interaction rates of the KO promastigotes with macrophage were lower compared to those of OE2a, OE2b, CT, CM2a, CM2b, or CM cells (Fig. 7A). Number of KO parasites in the infected macrophages was still lower compared to control cells when checked after 48 h of incubation. The lower level of infection in KO parasites might be due to lower number of infective metacyclic promastigotes. Additionally, the percentage of macrophages infected with null mutants was also significantly low compared to the CT and CM cell lines (Fig. 7B). We discovered that, in contrast to null mutants, CT and CM promastigotes in the BALB/c mice model could develop a severe disease (Fig. 7C). On the other hand, the OE2a and OE2b promastigotes were showing very negligible virulence in vivo infection model, revealing a fine tuning of the amount of intracellular GSH content is crucial for Leishmania infection. To strengthen the aforementioned results, we measured OE2a, OE2b, CT, KO, CM2a, CM2b, and CM parasite burden at 12 weeks post infection (Fig. 7D). Optimum level of parasite burden was present in CT and CM cells compared to KO and OE cell lines. These data confirmed the importance of LmChaC2 protein–mediated intracellular GSH homeostasis in parasite infection. It is well known that GSH is essential for Leishmania survival, but it is still unknown whether GSH homeostasis in the parasite is required for survival or not. In this article, we have shown for the first time that LmChaC-dependent controlled GSH degradation is crucial for chronic infection. Here, we discuss the following salient points: (a) we demonstrate that both the promastigote and the amastigote stages of Leishmania parasites express two ChaC proteins of different molecular weig"

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of BM on healthcare costs and resource utilization in patients with NSCLC by comparing patients with and without BM. This was a retrospective cohort analysis of South Korean health insurance review and assessment claims data. Patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC were identified (March 1, 2013 to February 28, 2018). We compared their two-year and per-patient-per-month (PPPM) healthcare costs and resource utilization with 1:3 propensity score-matched patients without the condition. A generalized linear model was used to estimate the impact of BM and other covariates on healthcare costs. After propensity score matching with the 33 402 newly diagnosed cases of stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, 3435 and 10 305 patients were classified as having or not having BM, respectively. Mean healthcare costs were significantly greater in patients with BM for both the two years (US$ 44 692 vs. US$ 32 230, p &lt; .0001) and PPPM (US$ 3510 vs. US$ 2573, p &lt; .0001). The length of hospital stay was longer in patients with BM (79.15 vs. 69.41 days for two years, p &lt; .0001; 7.69 vs. 6.86 days PPPM, p &lt; .0001), and patients with BM had more outpatient visits (50.61 vs. 46.43 times for two years, p &lt; .0001; 3.64 vs. 3.40 times PPPM costs, p &lt; .0001). The costs of drugs, radiology/radiotherapy, and admission comprised the majority of PPPM costs and were higher in patients with BM. The generalized linear model analysis suggested that patients with BM had significantly increased healthcare costs (by 1.29-fold, 95% confidence interval 1.26–1.32). BM is a significant economic burden for patients with NSCLC. Therefore, it is important to prevent BM in patients with NSCLC to reduce their economic burden."
https://openalex.org/W4296793674,"Background Individuals with hemiparesis following stroke often experience a decline in the paretic limb’s anteriorly directed ground reaction force during walking (i.e., limb propulsive force). Gait speed and walking capacity have been independently associated with paretic limb propulsion, quality of life, and participation in people with stroke. However, it is unclear as to the extent that underlying limb mechanics (i.e., propulsion) play in influencing perceptions of quality of life and participation. We therefore sought to determine the role of limb propulsion during gait on the perception of quality of life and participation in people following stroke. Methods This study is a secondary analysis of individuals involved in a gait retraining randomized control trial. Gait speed, walking capacity, limb propulsion, Stroke Impact Scale, and average daily step counts were assessed prior to and following 6 weeks of training. The pre-training data from 40 individuals were analyzed cross-sectionally using Pearson and Spearman correlations, to evaluate the potential relationship between limb propulsion (ratio of paretic limb propulsion to total propulsion) with gait speed, gait capacity, perceived quality of life domains, and average daily step counts. Partial correlations were used to control for gait speed. Thirty-one individuals were assessed longitudinally for the same relationships. Results We observed a training effect for gait speed, walking capacity, and some quality of life measures. However, after controlling for gait speed, we observed no significant (p≤0.05) correlations in the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Significance After controlling for the influence of gait speed, paretic limb propulsion is not directly related to perceived quality of life or participation. Although limb propulsion may not have a direct effect on participant’s perceived quality of life, it appears to be an important factor to enhance gait performance, and therefore may be important to target in rehabilitation, when feasible."

Methods A retrospective cohort study design was used to study PLHIV aged &gt; 15 years and started on ART in the periods of April to August 2016, and April to August 2017, then followed up for 24 months. Primary outcome was retention defined as being alive and on ARVs after 24 months. Death and loss to follow-up were considered as poor outcomes. Kaplan–Meier survival methods were used to describe time to primary outcome. Cox proportional regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with poor outcomes. Results 86 patients (470 before test and treat, and 316 after test and treat cohorts) were enrolled. Overall, the median [IQR] age was 39.3 [32.5–47.5] years and 539 (69%) were female. After 24 months, retention rates for the before (68%) and after (64%) test and start groups were similar (absolute difference: -4.0%, 95%CI: -11-3.1, P = 0.27). There were 240(31%, 95%CI 27 to 34%) PLHIV with poor outcomes, 102 (32%) and 138 (29%) occurred among the test and treat group, and delayed treatment patients respectively. In multivariable regression model, test and treat had no significant effect on risk of poor outcomes (aHR = 1.17, 95%CI 0.89–1.54). Increasing age (aHR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.97–0.99), formal employment (aHR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.23–0.76) and not being employed (aHR = 0.53, 95%CI 0.34–0.81) were negatively associated with poor outcomes. The risk of poor outcomes was higher among males compared to female patients (aHR = 1.37, 95%CI 1.03–1.82) and among divorced/separated patients compared to the married (aHR = 1.44, 95%CI 1.04–1.99). Conclusion Retention patterns for the “test and treat” cohort were comparable to those who started ART before “test and treat”. Patients who are males, young, divorced/separated, with poor socio-economic status had higher risks for poor clinical outcomes. Interventions targeting PLHIV who are young, male and economically disadvantaged provide an opportunity to improve the long-term outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4296794046,"Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in many parts of the world. As skin cancers start as skin lesions, it is important to identify precancerous skin lesions early. In this paper we propose an image based skin lesion identification to classify seven different classes of skin lesions. First, Multi Resolution Empirical Mode Decomposition (MREMD) is used to decompose each skin lesion image into a few Bidimensional intrinsic mode functions (BIMF). MREMD is a simplified bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) that employs downsampling and upsampling (interpolation) in the upper and lower envelope formation to speed up the decomposition process. A few BIMFs are extracted from the image using MREMD. The next step is to locate the lesion or the region of interest (ROI) in the image using active contour. Then Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is applied to the ROI of the image and its first BIMF to extract a total of 512 texture features from the lesion area. In the training phase, texture features of seven different classes of skin lesions are used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier. Altogether, 490 images from HAM10000 dataset are used to train the ANN. Then the accuracy of the approach is evaluated using 315 test images that are different from the training images. The test images are taken from the same dataset and each test image contains one type of lesion from the seven types that are classified. From each test image, 512 texture features are extracted from the lesion area and introduced to the classifier to determine its class. The proposed method achieves an overall classification rate of 98.9%."

One Salmonella Typhi isolate and 21 E. coli isolates were detected, while L. monocytogenes was not detected. S. Typhi was isolated from the carcass cooling chamber's floor, resistant to several antimicrobials, including nalidixic acid, cefazolin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and sulfonamide, and contained resistance genes, such as tet(B), tet(C), tet(M), and ampC. It also showed moderate biofilm-forming capacity at 37°C after incubating for 72 h. The prevalence of the 21 E. coli isolates was also the highest on the carcass cooling chamber floor (three of the four samplings [75%]). The E. coli isolates were resistant to 12 of the 13 tested antimicrobials, and none showed sensitivity to chloramphenicol, an antimicrobial prohibited in animal feed since 2003 in Brazil. The resistance genes MCR-1, MCR-3, sul1, ampC, clmA, cat1, tet(A), tet(B), and blaSHV, as well as the virulence genes stx-1, hlyA, eae, tir α, tir β, tir γ, and saa were detected in the E. coli isolates. Moreover, 5 (23.8%) and 15 (71.4%) E. coli isolates presented strong and moderate biofilm-forming capacity, respectively. In general, the biofilm-forming capacity increased after incubating for 72 h at 10°C. The biofilm-forming capacity was the lowest after incubating for 24 h at 37°C. Due to the presence of resistance and virulence genes, multi-antimicrobial resistance, and biofilm-forming capacity, the results of this study suggest a risk to the public health as these pathogens are associated with foodborne diseases, which emphasizes the hazard of resistance gene propagation in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W4296805868,"The beta distribution is routinely used to model variables that assume values in the standard unit interval, (0, 1). Several alternative laws have, nonetheless, been proposed in the literature, such as the Kumaraswamy and simplex distributions. A natural and empirically motivated question is: does the beta law provide an adequate representation for a given dataset? We test the null hypothesis that the beta model is correctly specified against the alternative hypothesis that it does not provide an adequate data fit. Our tests are based on the information matrix equality, which only holds when the model is correctly specified. They are thus sensitive to model misspecification. Simulation evidence shows that the tests perform well, especially when coupled with bootstrap resampling. We model state and county Covid-19 mortality rates in the United States. The misspecification tests indicate that the beta law successfully represents Covid-19 death rates when they are computed using either data from prior to the start of the vaccination campaign or data collected when such a campaign was under way. In the latter case, the beta law is only accepted when the negative impact of vaccination reach on death rates is moderate. The beta model is rejected under data heterogeneity, i.e., when mortality rates are computed using information gathered during both time periods."
https://openalex.org/W4296181730,"MutS homologs (MSHs) are highly conserved core components of DNA mismatch repair. Mismatch recognition provokes ATP-binding by MSH proteins that drives a conformational transition from a short-lived lesion-searching clamp to an extremely stable sliding clamp on the DNA. Here, we have expanded on previous bulk biochemical studies to examine the stability, lifetime, and kinetics of bacterial and human MSH sliding clamps on mismatched DNA using surface plasmon resonance and single-molecule analysis of fluorescently labeled proteins. We found that ATP-bound MSH complexes bound to blocked-end or very long mismatched DNAs were extremely stable over a range of ionic conditions. These observations underpinned the development of a high-throughput Förster resonance energy transfer system that specifically detects the formation of MSH sliding clamps on mismatched DNA. The Förster resonance energy transfer system is capable of distinguishing between HsMSH2-HsMSH3 and HsMSH2-HsMSH6 and appears suitable for chemical inhibitor screens. Taken together, our results provide additional insight into MSH sliding clamps as well as methods to distinguish their functions in mismatch repair."
https://openalex.org/W4296545248,"This study was conducted as a part of a larger study to identify the needs of a maternal and early childhood home visit program that the South Korean central government has begun to expand nationwide. This survey measured the distress of mothers with children aged 2 years or younger during the transition into motherhood using the Being a Mother scale (BaM-13) and compared the stress levels for each question with those of existing studies in other countries. The survey results revealed that the mean BaM-13 score of the 350 participants was 17.09 (SD = 6.81), with 87.7% showing very high levels of maternal distress, indicated by a score of 9 or above in BaM-13. The item from the BaM-13 with the highest response rate of 2 or 3 points (sum of the percentage of those who answered 2 and 3 points) was ""I have missed the life I had before I became pregnant with this baby/toddler,"" to which 80.8% of the respondents agreed. The percentage of South Korean mothers who answered 2 or 3 points was higher for every item on the BaM-13 than that of Australian mothers. A comparison of the total BaM-13 score and 3 factors (child experience, adult's experience, and emotional closeness) of the BaM-13 according to the participants' characteristics revealed that discrepancies in women's sociodemographic factors (including smoking and alcohol consumption behaviors) were not significant, whereas differences in the total BaM-13 score and the 3 factors of the BaM-13 according to the mothers' scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale were noticeable. The high level of maternal distress observed in this study should be reflected in the nurse-led maternal and early childhood home visit program that the South Korean central government is expanding across the country."

Despite its location in an inhospitable desert where food production is a constant challenge ancient Palmyra grew from a small oasis settlement in to a major geopolitical player. Here, we present a spatially explicit reconstruction of the land use and agricultural yield expectations of its hinterland determining the maximum feasible population of the city. Coupling the hinterland carrying capacity model with palaeoclimatic data allowed us to track changes in the food security of the city in the face of changing climate. While initially the hinterland could provide ample food resources for the small settlement with time the deteriorating climate conditions after the Roman Optimum (100 BCE-200 CE) collided with rapidly growing population of the city. The nexus of these two processes fall at mid third century-a period of profound changes in the structure of Palmyrene society, its geopolitical situation and its historical trajectory. The results point to increasingly precarious subsistence levels as a likely factor behind rapid militarization, shift towards an autocratic regime and military expansion of the city in the late third century CE. As a well-established causal mechanism in many modern conflicts and crises, food security is also a potential causal factor behind historical events, if a hard one to prove due to the difficulty of identifying relevant data patterns. The methods presented establishes a robust research pipeline that can be used on other ancient urban centers, contributing to the construction of an empirically supported model of how food security shaped human history, past and present."
https://openalex.org/W4296793405,"SMARCA1is a mammalian imitation switch (ISWI) gene that encodes for SNF2L. SNF2L is involved in regulating cell transition from a committed progenitor state to a differentiated state. Although many papers have detailed the correlation between SMARCA1 and different cancers, no pan-cancer analysis has been conducted to date. We started by exploring the potential carcinogenic role of SMARCA1 across 33 carcinomas using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) databases. The expression of SMARCA1 was significantly elevated in some tumor types but not in others. There was a distinct relationship between SMARCA1 expression and patient prognosis. S116 phosphorylation levels were up-regulated in both lung adenocarcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. The expression level of SMARCA1 was positively correlated with cancer-associated fibroblasts infiltration in a number of tumors, such as colon adenocarcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma. It was also associated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, SMARCA1 is involved in chromatin remodeling and protein processing-associated mechanisms. Our study presents an initial assessment and illustration of the carcinogenic role of SMARCA1 in different carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W4296793486,"The increasingly large size of the graphical and numerical data sets collected with modern technologies requires constant update and upgrade of the statistical models, methods and procedures to be used for their analysis in order to optimize learning and maximize knowledge and understanding. This is the case for plant CT scanning (CT: computed tomography), including applications aimed at studying leaf canopies and the structural complexity of the branching patterns that support them in trees. Therefore, we first show after a brief review, how the CT scanning data can be leveraged by constructing an analytical representation of a tree branching structure where each branch is represented by a line segment in 3D and classified in a level of a hierarchy, starting with the trunk (level 1). Each segment, or branch, is characterized by four variables: (i) the position on its parent, (ii) its orientation, a unit vector in 3D, (iii) its length, and (iv) the number of offspring that it bears. The branching structure of a tree can then be investigated by calculating descriptive statistics on these four variables. A deeper analysis, based on statistical models aiming to explain how the characteristics of a branch are associated with those of its parents, is also presented. The branching patterns of three miniature trees that were CT scanned are used to showcase the statistical modeling framework, and the differences in their structural complexity are reflected in the results. Overall, the most important determinant of a tree structure appears to be the length of the branches attached to the trunk. This variable impacts the characteristics of all the other branches of the tree."
https://openalex.org/W4296793619,"To analyze the diagnostic value of conducting urodynamic study (UDS) and show predictors for alpha blocker use 12 months after transurethral prostatectomy.Our study includes 406 participants that had a transurethral prostatectomy at our hospital between 2010 and 2019. All participants took alpha blockers for more than a month. We collected the participants' preoperative international prostatic symptom score (IPSS), uroflowmetry, transrectal ultrasound, and serum prostatic antigen (PSA) level. A total of 254 patients conducted UDS. After surgery, participants visited our hospital at 1,3,6, and 12 months.133 patients (32.6%) took alpha blockers continuously for 12 months after surgery. They reported poor preoperative IPSS scores and uroflowmetry outcomes. They also had high postoperative PVR (40.68±24.56 vs 29.34±25.11, p<0.001) and total IPSS score (10.35±7.96 vs 8.43±6.74, p = 0.018) compared to the group which discontinued alpha blockers. A multivariate analysis (Table 2) found that conducting preoperative UDS (Odds ratio (OR) 6.067, p<0.001) Age>75 (OR 2.463, p<0.001), a history of taking 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARI) before surgery (OR 2.186 [95% CI 1.334-3.583], p = 0.002), IPSS item straining (OR 1.224, p = 0.003), duration of taking alpha blockers [OR 1.009, p = 0.020), and Qmax (OR 0.926, p = 0.018), PVR (OR 1.002, p = 0.022) were confirmed as a strong predictors of persistent alpha blocker use.Conducting preoperative UDS, Age>75, history of taking 5-ARI before surgery, IPSS item straining, duration of alpha blocker medication, Qmax, and PVR are possible determinant factors of alpha blocker use after surgery. By comparing UDS outcomes, detrusor underactivity can be a strong predictor of persisting alpha blocker therapy 12 months after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W4296793896,"We reveal that an introduction of frequency-weighted inter-layer coupling term in networks of frequency dipoles can induce explosive synchronization transitions. The reason for explosive synchronization is that the oscillators with synchronization superiority are moderately suppressed. The findings show that a super-linear correlation induces explosive synchronization in networks of frequency dipoles, while a linear or sub-linear correlation excites chimera-like states. Clearly, the synchronization transition mode of networks of frequency dipoles is controlled by the power-law exponent. In addition, by means of the mean-field approximation, we obtain the critical values of the coupling strength within and between layers in two limit cases. The results of theoretical analysis are in good agreement with those of numerical simulation. Compared with the previous models, the model proposed in this paper retains the topological structure of network and the intrinsic properties of oscillators, so it is easy to realize pinning control."
https://openalex.org/W4296795083,"Experimental evidence in both human and animal studies demonstrated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) can induce short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) in the stimulated nucleus. Given that DBS-induced STP may be connected to the therapeutic effects of DBS, we sought to develop a computational predictive model that infers the dynamics of STP in response to DBS at different frequencies. Existing methods for estimating STP–either model-based or model-free approaches–require access to pre-synaptic spiking activity. However, in the context of DBS, extracellular stimulation (e.g. DBS) can be used to elicit presynaptic activations directly. We present a model-based approach that integrates multiple individual frequencies of DBS-like electrical stimulation as pre-synaptic spikes and infers parameters of the Tsodyks-Markram (TM) model from post-synaptic currents of the stimulated nucleus. By distinguishing between the steady-state and transient responses of the TM model, we develop a novel dual optimization algorithm that infers the model parameters in two steps. First, the TM model parameters are calculated by integrating multiple frequencies of stimulation to estimate the steady state response of post-synaptic current through a closed-form analytical solution. The results of this step are utilized as the initial values for the second step in which a non-derivative optimization algorithm is used to track the transient response of the post-synaptic potential across different individual frequencies of stimulation. Moreover, in order to confirm the applicability of the method, we applied our algorithm–as a proof of concept–to empirical data recorded from acute rodent brain slices of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during DBS-like stimulation to infer dynamics of STP for inhibitory synaptic inputs."
https://openalex.org/W4296797202,"Comprehensive statistics evaluating pregnancies complicated by various medical conditions are desirable for the optimization of prenatal care and for improving maternal and fetal outcomes. The main objective of our study was to assess pregnancies during a 13-year study period with accompanying pregestational neurological disorders in medical history on a nationwide level.In the framework of the NEUROHUN 2004-2017 project utilizing medical reports submitted for reimbursement purposes to the National Health Insurance Fund, we included women with at least one labor during 2004-2016 who had at least one pregestational diagnosis of a neurological disorder received within this time frame prior to their first pregnancy during the studied period. Three-digit codes from the 10th International Classification of Diseases (ICD) were used for the identification and classification of neurological and obstetrical conditions.Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were employed during the study process. A total of 744 226 women have been identified with at least one delivery during the study period with 98 792 of them (13.3%) having at least one neurological diagnosis received during 2004-2016 before their first gestation in the time frame of the study. The vast majority of diagnosis codes were related to different types of headaches affecting 69 149 (9.3%) individuals. The most prevalent diagnoses following headaches were dizziness and giddiness (15 589 patients [2.1%]; nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders (10 375 patients [1.4%]); epileptic disorders (7028 patients [0.9%]); neurological diseases of vascular origin (6091 patients [0.8%]); other disorders of the nervous system (5358 patients [0.7%]); and demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (2129 patients [0.3%]). The present findings of our study show high prevalence of pregestational neurological disorders, the dominance of headaches followed by the rather nonspecific diagnosis of dizziness and giddiness, the relevance of nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders and epilepsy, and the importance of cerebrovascular disorders among women of childbearing age.The present research findings can help healthcare professionals, researchers and decision makers in adopting specific health policy measures based on nationwide data and further aid the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms of various neurological manifestations concerning women of childbearing age."
https://openalex.org/W4296797704,"Background Haiti’s first COVID-19 cases were confirmed on March 18, 2020, and subsequently spread throughout the country. The objective of this study was to describe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in Haitian outpatients and to identify risk factors for severity of clinical manifestations. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 outpatients diagnosed from March 18-August 4, 2020, using demographic, epidemiological, and clinical data reported to the Ministry of Health (MoH). We used univariate and multivariate analysis, including multivariable logistic regression, to explore the risk factors and specific symptoms related to persons with symptomatic COVID-19 and the severity of symptomatic COVID-19 disease. Results Of 5,389 cases reported to MOH during the study period, 1,754 (32.5%) were asymptomatic. Amongst symptomatic persons 2,747 (75.6%) had mild COVID-19 and 888 (24.4%) had moderate-to-severe disease; the most common symptoms were fever (69.6%), cough (51.9%), and myalgia (45.8%). The odds of having moderate-to-severe disease were highest among persons with hypertension (aOR = 1.72, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] (1.34, 2.20), chronic pulmonary disease (aOR = 3.93, 95% CI (1.93, 8.17)) and tuberculosis (aOR = 3.44, 95% CI (1.35, 9.14)) compared to persons without those conditions. The odds of having moderate-to-severe disease increased with age but was also seen among children aged 0–4 years (OR: 1.73, 95% CI (0.93, 3.08)), when using 30–39 years old as the reference group. All of the older age groups, 50–64 years, 65–74 years, 75–84 years, and 85+ years, had significantly higher odds of having moderate-to-severe COVID-19 compared with ages 30–39 years. Diabetes was associated with elevated odds of moderate-to-severe disease in bivariate analysis (OR = 2.17, 95% CI (1.58,2.98) but, this association did not hold in multivariable analyses (aOR = 1.22,95%CI (0.86,1.72)). Conclusion These findings from a resource-constrained country highlight the importance of surveillance systems to track emerging infections and their risk factors. In addition to co-morbidities described elsewhere, tuberculosis was a risk factor for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 disease."
https://openalex.org/W4296800137,"Introduction In response to the limited supply of personal protective equipment during the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, recent studies demonstrate that gaseous H 2 O 2 is an effective decontaminant of N95 filtering facepiece respirators to enable reuse of these items in a clinical setting. This paper evaluates the efficacy of the Arca Aerosolized Hydrogen Peroxide Decontamination System (Arca), a novel aerosolized H 2 O 2 decontamination system, using biologic indicator testing. Materials and methods The Arca produces and circulates H 2 O 2 aerosol inside of a sealed stainless steel chamber. The Arca’s decontamination efficacy was evaluated in 8 decontamination trials with 2 H 2 O 2 concentrations (3% and 12%) and 4 decontamination cycle durations (45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes). Efficacy was evaluated by testing: 1) the concentration in parts per million (ppm) of H 2 O 2 produced inside the chamber and the concentration in ppm of H 2 O 2 vented from the chamber, and 2) the decontamination of Mesa Biologic Indicator filter strips (BI) inoculated with Geobacillus Stearothermophilus . Control tests were conducted by submerging BI strips in 3mL of 3% and 12% H 2 O 2 for 120 minutes (negative controls) and by not exposing one BI strip to H 2 O 2 (positive control). Results Greater than 5000 ppm of H 2 O 2 was detected on the concentration strips inside the chamber for each of the eight decontamination trials. No vented H 2 O 2 was detected on the external concentration strips after any decontamination trial. No growth was observed for any of the negative controls after seven days. The positive control was positive for growth. Conclusion The Arca Aerosolized Hydrogen Peroxide Decontamination System is effective at decontaminating bacterial G . Stearothermophilus at a cycle time of 45 minutes utilizing 6mL of 3% H 2 O 2 solution."
https://openalex.org/W4296806434,"Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most deadly and common diseases in the world, accounting for over 881,000 casualties in 2018. The PTPRK-RSPO3 (P:R) fusion is a structural variation in CRC and well known for its ability to activate WNT signaling and tumorigenesis. However, till now, therapeutic targets and actionable drugs are limited in this subtype of cancer. Materials and method The purpose of this study is to identify key genes and cancer-related pathways specific for P:R fusion-positive CRC. In addition, we also inferred the actionable drugs in bioinformatics analysis using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Results 2,505 genes were altered in RNA expression specific for P:R fusion-positive CRC. By pathway analysis based on the altered genes, ten major cancer-related signaling pathways (Apoptosis, Direct p53, EGFR, ErbB, JAK-STAT, tyrosine kinases, Pathways in Cancer, SCF-KIT, VEGFR, and WNT-related Pathway) were significantly altered in P:R fusion-positive CRC. Among these pathways, the most altered cancer genes ( ALK , ACSL3 , AXIN , MYC , TP53 , GNAQ , ACVR2A , and FAS ) specific for P:R fusion and involved in multiple cancer pathways were considered to have a key role in P:R fusion-positive CRC. Based on the drug-target network analysis, crizotinib, alectinib, lorlatinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, erdafitinib, infigratinib and pemigatinib were selected as putative therapeutic candidates, since they were already used in routine clinical practice in other cancer types and target genes of the drugs were involved in multiple cancer-pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4296807177,"Little is known about the current practice of airway management in Germany and its development over the last decades. The present study was, therefore, designed to answer the following questions. Which airway management procedures have been performed over the last 16 years and how has the frequency of these procedures changed over time? Is there a relationship between patient characteristics or surgical specialisation and the type of airway management performed?In the present study, we used our in-house data acquisition and accounting system to retrospectively analyse airway management data for all patients who underwent a surgical or medical procedure with anaesthesiological care at our tertiary care facility over the past 16 years. 340,748 airway management procedures were analysed by type of procedure, medical/surgical specialty, and type of device used. Logistic regression was used to identify trends over time.Oral intubation was the most common technique over 16 years (65.7%), followed by supraglottic airway devices (18.1%), nasal intubation (7.5%), mask ventilation (1.6%), tracheal cannula (1.3%), double lumen tube (0.7%), and jet ventilation (0.6%). On average, the odds ratio of using supraglottic airway devices increased by 17.0% per year (OR per year = 1.072, 95% CI = 1.071-1.088) while oral intubation rates decreased. In 2005, supraglottic airway devices were used in about 10% of all airway management procedures. Until 2020, this proportion steadily increased by 27%. Frequency of oral intubation on the other hand decreased and was about 75% in 2005 and 53% in 2020. Over time, second-generation supraglottic airway devices were used more frequently than first-generation supraglottic airway devices. While second-generation devices made up about 9% of all supraglottic airway devices in 2010, in 2020 they represented a proportion of 82%. The use of fibreoptic intubation increased over time in otorhinolaryngology and dental, oral, and maxillofacial surgery, but showed no significant trends over the entire 16-year period.Our data represent the first large-scale evaluation of airway management procedures over a long time. There was a significant upward trend in the use of supraglottic airway devices, with an increase in the use of second-generation masks while a decrease in oral intubations was observed."
