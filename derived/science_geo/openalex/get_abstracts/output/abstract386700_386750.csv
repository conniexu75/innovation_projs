https://openalex.org/W2107325549,"The blood–brain barrier is a gatekeeper between the central nervous system and the rest of the body, and is made up of vascular endothelial cells. Previous work upheld the notion that the barrier was formed postnatally as a result of signalling from non-neuronal cells called astrocytes to endothelial cells. Now, two independent studies demonstrate that the barrier is in fact formed during embryogenesis, with the critical factor being the interaction between blood-vessel-surrounding cells called pericytes and epithelial cells. A better understanding of the tight relationship between pericytes, neuroendothelial cells and astrocytes in blood–brain barrier function will contribute to our understanding of the breakdown of the barrier during central nervous system injury and disease. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is made up of vascular endothelial cells and was thought to have formed postnatally from astrocytes. Two independent studies demonstrate that this barrier forms during embryogenesis, with pericyte/endothelial cell interactions being critical to regulate the BBB during development. A better understanding of the relationship among pericytes, neuroendothelial cells and astrocytes in BBB function will contribute to our understanding of BBB breakdown during central nervous system injury and disease. Vascular endothelial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) form a barrier that restricts the movement of molecules and ions between the blood and the brain. This blood–brain barrier (BBB) is crucial to ensure proper neuronal function and protect the CNS from injury and disease1. Transplantation studies have demonstrated that the BBB is not intrinsic to the endothelial cells, but is induced by interactions with the neural cells2. Owing to the close spatial relationship between astrocytes and endothelial cells, it has been hypothesized that astrocytes induce this critical barrier postnatally3, but the timing of BBB formation has been controversial4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we demonstrate that the barrier is formed during embryogenesis as endothelial cells invade the CNS and pericytes are recruited to the nascent vessels, over a week before astrocyte generation. Analysing mice with null and hypomorphic alleles of Pdgfrb, which have defects in pericyte generation, we demonstrate that pericytes are necessary for the formation of the BBB, and that absolute pericyte coverage determines relative vascular permeability. We demonstrate that pericytes regulate functional aspects of the BBB, including the formation of tight junctions and vesicle trafficking in CNS endothelial cells. Pericytes do not induce BBB-specific gene expression in CNS endothelial cells, but inhibit the expression of molecules that increase vascular permeability and CNS immune cell infiltration. These data indicate that pericyte–endothelial cell interactions are critical to regulate the BBB during development, and disruption of these interactions may lead to BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation during CNS injury and disease."

https://openalex.org/W1990586954,"The Ndc80 complex is a key site of regulated kinetochore-microtubule attachment (a process required for cell division), but the molecular mechanism underlying its function remains unknown. Here we present a subnanometre-resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the human Ndc80 complex bound to microtubules, sufficient for precise docking of crystal structures of the component proteins. We find that the Ndc80 complex binds the microtubule with a tubulin monomer repeat, recognizing α- and β-tubulin at both intra- and inter-tubulin dimer interfaces in a manner that is sensitive to tubulin conformation. Furthermore, Ndc80 complexes self-associate along protofilaments through interactions mediated by the amino-terminal tail of the NDC80 protein, which is the site of phospho-regulation by Aurora B kinase. The complex's mode of interaction with the microtubule and its oligomerization suggest a mechanism by which Aurora B could regulate the stability of load-bearing kinetochore-microtubule attachments."

https://openalex.org/W1980023815,"The spatial organization of chromosomes inside the cell nucleus is still poorly understood. This organization is guided by intra- and interchromosomal contacts and by interactions of specific chromosomal loci with relatively fixed nuclear 'landmarks' such as the nuclear envelope and the nucleolus. Researchers have begun to use new molecular genome-wide mapping techniques to uncover both types of molecular interactions, providing insights into the fundamental principles of interphase chromosome folding."
https://openalex.org/W2100054308,"It has recently been suggested that galaxies in the early Universe could have grown through the accretion of cold gas, and that this may have been the main driver of star formation and stellar mass growth. Because the cold gas is essentially primordial, it has a very low abundance of elements heavier than helium (referred to as metallicity). If funnelled to the centre of a galaxy, it will result in the central gas having an overall lower metallicity than gas further from the centre, because the gas further out has been enriched by supernovae and stellar winds, and not diluted by the primordial gas. Here we report chemical abundances across three rotationally supported star-forming galaxies at redshift z ≈ 3, only 2 Gyr after the Big Bang. We find 'inverse' gradients, with the central, star-forming regions having lower metallicities than less active ones, which is opposite to what is seen in local galaxies. We conclude that the central gas has been diluted by the accretion of primordial gas, as predicted by 'cold flow' models."

https://openalex.org/W2054222787,"The calcium-regulated phosphatase calcineurin intersects with both calcium and cAMP-mediated signaling pathways in the pancreatic β-cell. Pharmacologic calcineurin inhibition, necessary to prevent rejection in the setting of organ transplantation, is associated with post-transplant β-cell failure. We sought to determine the effect of calcineurin inhibition on β-cell replication and survival in rodents and in isolated human islets. Further, we assessed whether the GLP-1 receptor agonist and cAMP stimulus, exendin-4 (Ex-4), could rescue β-cell replication and survival following calcineurin inhibition. Following treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus, human β-cell apoptosis was significantly increased. Although we detected no human β-cell replication, tacrolimus significantly decreased rodent β-cell replication. Ex-4 nearly normalized both human β-cell survival and rodent β-cell replication when co-administered with tacrolimus. We found that tacrolimus decreased Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that calcineurin could regulate replication and survival via the PI3K/Akt pathway. We identify insulin receptor substrate-2 (Irs2), a known cAMP-responsive element-binding protein target and upstream regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as a novel calcineurin target in β-cells. Irs2 mRNA and protein are decreased by calcineurin inhibition in both rodent and human islets. The effect of calcineurin on Irs2 expression is mediated at least in part through the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), as NFAT occupied the Irs2 promoter in a calcineurin-sensitive manner. Ex-4 restored Irs2 expression in tacrolimus-treated rodent and human islets nearly to baseline. These findings reveal calcineurin as a regulator of human β-cell survival in part through regulation of Irs2, with implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetes following organ transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W2048700535,"Interaction of the pattern recognition receptor, RAGE with key ligands such as advanced glycation end products (AGE), S100 proteins, amyloid β, and HMGB1 has been linked to diabetic complications, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. To help answer the question of how a single receptor can recognize and respond to a diverse set of ligands we have investigated the structure and binding properties of the first two extracellular domains of human RAGE, which are implicated in various ligand binding and subsequent signaling events. The 1.5-Å crystal structure reveals an elongated molecule with a large basic patch and a large hydrophobic patch, both highly conserved. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and deletion experiments indicate S100B recognition by RAGE is an entropically driven process involving hydrophobic interaction that is dependent on Ca(2+) and on residues in the C'D loop (residues 54-67) of domain 1. In contrast, competition experiments using gel shift assays suggest that RAGE interaction with AGE is driven by the recognition of negative charges on AGE-proteins. We also demonstrate that RAGE can bind to dsDNA and dsRNA. These findings reveal versatile structural features of RAGE that help explain its ability to recognize of multiple ligands."

https://openalex.org/W2000624583,"In contrast to studies on skeletal and smooth muscles, the identity of kinases in the heart that are important physiologically for direct phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) is not known. A Ca2+/calmodulin-activated myosin light chain kinase is expressed only in cardiac muscle (cMLCK), similar to the tissue-specific expression of skeletal muscle MLCK and in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of smooth muscle MLCK. We have ablated cMLCK expression in male mice to provide insights into its role in RLC phosphorylation in normally contracting myocardium. The extent of RLC phosphorylation was dependent on the extent of cMLCK expression in both ventricular and atrial muscles. Attenuation of RLC phosphorylation led to ventricular myocyte hypertrophy with histological evidence of necrosis and fibrosis. Echocardiography showed increases in left ventricular mass as well as end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions. Cardiac performance measured as fractional shortening decreased proportionally with decreased cMLCK expression culminating in heart failure in the setting of no RLC phosphorylation. Hearts from female mice showed similar responses with loss of cMLCK associated with diminished RLC phosphorylation and cardiac hypertrophy. Isoproterenol infusion elicited hypertrophic cardiac responses in wild type mice. In mice lacking cMLCK, the hypertrophic hearts showed no additional increases in size with the isoproterenol treatment, suggesting a lack of RLC phosphorylation blunted the stress response. Thus, cMLCK appears to be the predominant protein kinase that maintains basal RLC phosphorylation that is required for normal physiological cardiac performance in vivo.

Sarcomeric proteins in myocytes account for contraction of the heart that depends on the molecular motor myosin in the thick filaments binding to actin in thin filaments to initiate shortening and force development (1Gordon A.M.

RLC is necessary for assembly of thick filaments in cardiac myocytes, and mutations in RLC are linked to inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (5Rottbauer W. Wessels G. Dahme T. Just S. Trano N.

Additionally, phosphorylation of RLC in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers by a skeletal muscle-specific Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCK modulates the contractile response by potentiating frequency-dependent force development (9Sweeney H.L.

RLC phosphorylation in skinned fibers increases the extent and rate of force development while decreasing sarcomeric interfilament spacing (9Sweeney H.L. Bowman B.F. Stull J.T. Am. J.

It is also proposed that altered RLC phosphorylation may contribute to compensatory responses and contractile dysfunction in human diseases (19van der Velden J. Papp Z. Boontje N.M.

Kinases that phosphorylate RLC in the heart have not been clearly identified, although there are two primary candidates, cMLCK and ZIPK. Skeletal muscle MLCK was reported to be present in heart (20Davis J.S. Hassanzadeh S. Winitsky S. Lin H. Satorius C. Vemuri R. Aletras A.H. Wen H. Epstein N.D.

Cardiac RLC is not a good substrate for the ubiquitous smooth muscle MLCK, which is present in cardiac myocytes and probably phosphorylates nonmuscle cytoplasmic myosin II-B (10Zhi G. Ryder J.W.

Recently, a novel cMLCK was identified in human heart failure and found to be regulated by the cardiac homeobox protein Nkx2-5 during development (24Seguchi O. Takashima S. Yamazaki S. Asakura M. Asano Y. Shintani Y. Wakeno M. Minamino T. Kondo H. Furukawa H. Nakamaru K. Naito A. Takahashi T. Ohtsuka T. Kawakami K. Isomura T. Kitamura S. Tomoike H. Mochizuki N. Kitakaze M. J. Clin.

Res. 2008; 102: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Suppression of cMLCK expression in zebra fish embryos led to ventricular dilation with incomplete sarcomere formation, whereas overexpression in neonatal myocytes promoted sarcomere organization and increased cell contractility. Cardiac RLC is also a good biochemical substrate for ZIPK, and knockdown of the kinase in neonatal myocytes by siRNA inhibited RLC phosphorylation (26Chang A.N. Chen G. Gerard R.D. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5122-5126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, ZIPK has emerged as another candidate kinase that may phosphorylate RLC. We have ablated cMLCK expression in mice to determine its role in RLC phosphorylation. Because it appears to be the primary kinase for basal RLC phosphorylation that may modulate cardiac function, we also evaluated cardiac adaptations resulting from RLC dephosphorylation to obtain insights into the physiological role for cMLCK. The strategy to study the physiological role of cMLCK in cardiac myocytes was to modify the cMLCK gene to ablate expression at different developmental times from embryonic to adult stages (27Maillet M. Davis J. Auger-Messier M. York A. Osinska H. Piquereau J. Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Ventura-Clapier R. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6716-6724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our approach involved development of a LoxP-targeted allele in mice that will allow different cardiac expressing Cre transgenes to affect cMLCK expression at different developmental times. However, because others suggested that cMLCK was a cardiac myocyte-specific kinase (24Seguchi O. Takashima S. Yamazaki S. Asakura M. Asano Y. Shintani Y. Wakeno M. Minamino T. Kondo H. Furukawa H.

Res. 2008; 102: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we decided initially to affect kinase expression by retaining the marker cassette containing the neomycin resistance gene (neo) as part of the initial floxed allele to generate a hypomorphic allele (28Lewandoski M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Genomic regions of the mouse cMLCK (MYLK3) locus were isolated from 129SvEv genomic DNA by LA Taq™ polymerase (Takara Bio) and cloned into targeting vector OS.DUP/DEL with a TK cassette for negative selection and a neo cassette for positive selection. A 2.6-kb genomic sequence (5′-targeting arm, short arm) upstream of cMLCK exon 4, bounded by an upstream XhoI site and a downstream ClaI site, was cloned upstream of the 5′ loxP sequence in the targeting vector. A 4.4-kb genomic sequence (3′-targeting arm, long arm) downstream of cMLCK exon 4, bounded by an upstream SalI site and a downstream SalI site (including BamHI BglII recognition sequence at the 3′ end for subsequent screening), was cloned downstream of the 3′ loxP sequence. A 1.2-kb region (conditional knock-out region, knock-out arm), including exon 4, bounded by an upstream NdeI site and a downstream AflII site, was cloned between the 5′ loxP sequence and the 5′ FRT sequence. The resulting vector was verified by DNA sequencing and restriction mapping. The vector was linearized at the PvuI site downstream of the 3′-targeting arm and electroporated into 129SvEv-derived embryonic stem cells. Cells were then treated with G418, and negative selection was accomplished by gancyclovir. Southern blot analysis was performed using probes located 5′ of the 5′-targeting arm and 3′ of the 3′-targeting arm (Fig. 1). Accurate recombination was verified by sequencing genomic PCR products derived from primers located 5′ of the 5′-targeting arm and within the neomycin resistance cassette and 3′ of the 3′-targeting arm and within the neomycin resistance cassette. Three cMLCK-targeted embryonic stem clones were identified. Two clones were expanded and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts that were transferred to the uterus of pseudopregnant females. High percentage chimeric male mice (cMLCK+/neo) were bred into a C57BL/6 background to obtain germ line transmission. We generated mice with a cMLCK hypomorphic allele (cMLCKneo/neo) by intercrossing cMLCK+/neo to each other. All experiments on mice were conducted in a 129SvEv/C57Bl/6 mixed background. Genotyping was performed by Southern blotting with 5′ and 3′ probes. Animals were housed under standard conditions and maintained on commercial mouse chow and water ad libitum. The environment was maintained at 22 °C with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. All animal experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Southern blot probes were generated by PCR using the following primer sets: 5′ probe forward, 5′-CTGGGACTGGGATTATAGACAATTGTG-3′, reverse, 5′-GGTCTAATTAACAGCATGGCCAATGG-3′; and 3′ probe forward, 5′-GGGTCATAGCCATCATTGCACAG-3′, reverse, 5′-GTTAAAGACCATACTTGAGACTCGAGCC-3′. In brief, tail genomic DNA was digested with BglII (5′ screening) or BamHI (3′ screening) and analyzed using a standard Southern blot protocol. Total RNA was purified from isolated heart ventricles with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of RNA were used as template to synthesize cDNA using random hexamers. Quantitative PCR was performed using the following TaqMan® probes purchased from Applied Biosystems: ANP, Mm01255748_g1; BNP, Mm00435304_g1; Col1a2, Mm00483888_m1; Myh6, Mm00440354_m1; Myh7, Mm00600555_m1; and rodent GAPDH, 4308313. Analyses were performed by the comparative CT method. Initial data were normalized to GAPDH; relative values were obtained by normalizing to the mean for cMLCK+/+ ventricles. For Western blot analysis, hearts were isolated for dissection in less than 2 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until homogenization. Changes in RLC phosphorylation occur on the order of 30–45 min in heart, so immediate fixation in situ is not essential to measure the extent of phosphorylation that reflects in vivo values (15Herring B.P. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Silver P.J. Buja L.M. Stull J.T. J. Mol. Cell.

Tissues were homogenized in 10% trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm dithiothreitol at 0 °C, and total proteins were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 1 min in a tabletop centrifuge. Protein pellets were solubilized into 8 m urea as described previously (10Zhi G. Ryder J.W. Huang J. Ding P. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Muscle samples were subjected to urea/glycerol-PAGE to separate phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated RLC as described previously (31Huang J. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19748-19756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because the urea/glycerol-PAGE system separates nonphosphorylated from the phosphorylated RLC, we have a direct quantitative measure of RLC phosphorylation in terms of percent phosphorylation. Because the separation results from a single phosphate, data may also be calculated as mol of phosphate/mol of RLC. Diphosphorylation results in additional migration of RLC in the urea-PAGE system, but cardiac muscle has very little diphosphorylated RLC (26Chang A.N. Chen G. Gerard R.D. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J.

Quantitative measurements were processed on a Storm PhosphorImager and analyzed by ImageQuant software. Additional Western blotting was performed by SDS-PAGE on other proteins solubilized in the 8 m urea buffer. For preparation of soluble proteins, tissues were homogenized in buffer at pH 7.6 containing (in mm) Tris-HCl 50, EGTA 2, EDTA 2, NaCl 150, dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Contractile proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min. Equal volumes of total and supernatant fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Antibodies to cMLCK, MYPT2, and MLC2a were raised to bacterially expressed mouse protein (Proteintech Group, Inc.). Antibodies to MLC2v from bovine heart were previously described (31Huang J.

The size of cardiac myocytes was measured following wheat germ agglutinin staining as described previously (23Ma X. Takeda K. Singh A. Yu Z.X. Zerfas P. Blount A. Liu C. Towbin J.A.

Echocardiograms were performed on conscious, gently restrained mice using either a Sonos 5500 system with a 15-MHz linear probe or Vevo 2100 system with a MS400C scanhead. Left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole (LVEDD) and end-systole (LVESD) were measured from M-mode recordings. Fractional shortening was calculated as (LVEDD − LVESD)/LVEDD (%). Measurements of interventricular septum thickness, left ventricular internal diameter, and left ventricular posterior wall thickness were made from two-dimensional parasternal short axis views in diastole. Left ventricular mass was calculated by the cubed method as 1.05 × ((IVS + LVID + LVPW)3 − LVID3) (mg), where IVS is interventricular septum thickness; LVID is left ventricular internal diameter; LVPW is left ventricular posterior wall thickness (33Collins K.A.

All measurements were made at the level of papillary muscles. Mice were treated with isoproterenol for 7 days to induce cardiac hypertrophy (31Huang J. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Kamm K.E.

Isoproterenol at 40 mg/ml/g of mouse in saline or saline itself was injected into an Alzet® mini-osmotic pump (model 2001, Durect Corp.), which releases at 1.0 μl/h. Pumps were surgically implanted on the back during anesthesia. Echocardiographic measurements were performed before and after the isoproterenol infusion. At the end of the treatment, mice were anesthetized (250 mg/kg Avertin, intraperitoneal) and weighed. Whole hearts were removed, weighed, and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tibial length was also measured. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical evaluation was carried out by using an unpaired Student's t test for two comparisons or analysis of variance (plus the Newman-Keuls method) for multiple comparisons of data with variance homoscedasticity assessed by the Bartlett method. Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum and Nemenyi tests were used in multiple comparisons for data not meeting the homoscedastic variance test. Significance was accepted at a value of p < 0.05. The mRNA for cMLCK was previously shown to be expressed in ventricular and atrial muscle of the heart with no significant expression in other tissues, including skeletal or smooth muscles as well as nonmuscle tissues (24Seguchi O.

We have obtained similar results with Northern and Western blotting of cMLCK in diverse tissues, which emphasizes the tissue-specific expression of cMLCK (data not shown). We also immunostained for cMLCK in adult mouse hearts showing specific expression in both ventricular and atrial cardiac myocytes (Fig. 2). The kinase appeared localized in the cytoplasm so we determined biochemically if it was associated with myofilaments (Fig. 2). Comparison of cMLCK in total tissue homogenates with that in supernatant fractions after removal of myofilaments by centrifugation showed that cMLCK was soluble in both ventricular and atrial myocytes, similar to the solubility of skeletal muscle MLCK (34Nunnally M.H. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1776-1780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in contrast to myofilament binding of smooth muscle MLCK (35Smith L. Parizi-Robinson M. Zhu M.S.

Additionally, the amount of cMLCK expression appeared greater in atria than in ventricles. cMLCK was distributed evenly throughout all portions of the ventricles. Because cMLCK is a cardiac myocyte-specific kinase, we decided initially to perturb kinase expression by retaining the marker cassette containing the neomycin resistance gene (neo) as part of the initial floxed allele to generate a hypomorphic allele (28Lewandoski M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The long range strategy was to have animals in which the neo cassette could be removed and then ablate the gene in adult mice with conditional Cre expression. A targeting vector containing a neo cassette included frt sites as well as loxP sites flanking exon 4 (Fig. 1). Southern analysis of both the 5′ and 3′ arms of the targeted cMLCK gene demonstrated successful recombination and germ line transmission (Fig. 1). Additionally, insertion of the neo cassette disrupted cMLCK expression in both atrial and ventricular myocytes (Fig. 3). Expression of cMLCK protein in ventricular and atrial tissues from cMLCKneo/neo mice was undetectable, whereas the amount in cMLCK+/neo mice was about 50% that found in wild type mice. Interestingly, the partial reduction of cMLCK protein in cMLCK+/neo mice led to a partial reduction of RLC phosphorylation in both ventricular (MLC2v) and atrial (MLC2a) muscles (Fig. 3). The extent of RLC phosphorylation in ventricular and atrial tissues from cMLCKneo/neo mice was less than 5% that obtained for hearts from wild type animals. The extent of basal RLC phosphorylation appears to be dependent on the amount of cMLCK expressed, thus indicating the kinase activity is a limiting factor for RLC phosphorylation. We removed the neo cassette by crossing Flp-deleter mouse strain to mice containing the neo cassette flanked by frt sites and confirmed crossing results by Southern analysis. The resulting mice containing single (cMLCK+/f) or double (cMLCKf/f) floxed alleles without the neo cassette had similar amounts of cMLCK protein as wild type mice. The relative amounts were 100 ± 1, 104 ± 6, and 99 ± 10% (mean ± S.E., n = 5) for wild type, cMLCK+/f, and cMLCKf/f mice, respectively. The extent of MLC2v phosphorylation was also not different with 0.42 ± 0.2, 0.42 ± 0.01, and 0.41 ± 0.02 for wild type, cMLCK+/f, and cMLCKf/f mice, respectively. The morphological properties of hearts in the three different groups appeared normal. Thus, the insertion of the neo cassette appears to be selective for disrupting cMLCK expression. We also measured the protein contents of other related proteins, including MLC2v, MLC2a, MYPT2, cTnI, and smooth muscle MLCK (Table 1). There were no differences in the amounts of these proteins in cMLCK+/+, cMLCK+/neo, and cMLCKneo/neo mice. Thus, the loss of cMLCK protein or insertion of the neo cassette did not affect expression of these related proteins.TABLE 1Relative expression of proteins related to cardiac myosinMeasurementsap < 0.05 for comparisons to cMLCK+/+ mice.cMLCK+/+cMLCKneo/neo%%MLC2v100 ± 2099 ± 9MLC2a100 ± 7102 ± 4MYPT2100 ± 1188 ± 12cTnI100 ± 796 ± 10Smooth muscle MLCK100 ± 1687 ± 12a p < 0.05 for comparisons to cMLCK+/+ mice.

TLC is now shown to correspond to the genome of TLCΦ, a satellite filamentous phage that uses the morphogenesis genes of a third filamentous phage (fs2Φ) to form infectious particles. By reconstructing the events that lead to the acquisition of phage DNA and comparing these to the genome of pandemic strains, Hassan et al. obtain a model of how virulent V. cholerae strains evolve to become successful human pathogens. Bacterial chromosomes often carry integrated genetic elements (such as plasmids and prophages) that contribute to the evolutionary fitness of the host bacterium. In Vibrio cholerae, a prophage encodes cholera toxin. Here, the events that led to the acquisition of phage DNA have been reconstructed, revealing the cooperative interactions between multiple filamentous phages that contributed to the emergence of virulent V. cholerae strains. Bacterial chromosomes often carry integrated genetic elements (for example plasmids, transposons, prophages and islands) whose precise function and contribution to the evolutionary fitness of the host bacterium are unknown. The CTXφ prophage, which encodes cholera toxin in Vibrio cholerae1, is known to be adjacent to a chromosomally integrated element of unknown function termed the toxin-linked cryptic (TLC)2. Here we report the characterization of a TLC-related element that corresponds to the genome of a satellite filamentous phage (TLC-Knφ1), which uses the morphogenesis genes of another filamentous phage (fs2φ) to form infectious TLC-Knφ1 phage particles. The TLC-Knφ1 phage genome carries a sequence similar to the dif recombination sequence, which functions in chromosome dimer resolution using XerC and XerD recombinases3. The dif sequence is also exploited by lysogenic filamentous phages (for example CTXφ) for chromosomal integration of their genomes. Bacterial cells defective in the dimer resolution often show an aberrant filamentous cell morphology3,4. We found that acquisition and chromosomal integration of the TLC-Knφ1 genome restored a perfect dif site and normal morphology to V. cholerae wild-type and mutant strains with dif− filamentation phenotypes. Furthermore, lysogeny of a dif− non-toxigenic V. cholerae with TLC-Knφ1 promoted its subsequent toxigenic conversion through integration of CTXφ into the restored dif site. These results reveal a remarkable level of cooperative interactions between multiple filamentous phages in the emergence of the bacterial pathogen that causes cholera."

https://openalex.org/W2077373124,"The peculiar object P/2010 A2 was discovered in January 2010 and given a cometary designation because of the presence of a trail of material, although there was no central condensation or coma. The appearance of this object, in an asteroidal orbit (small eccentricity and inclination) in the inner main asteroid belt attracted attention as a potential new member of the recently recognized class of main-belt comets. If confirmed, this new object would expand the range in heliocentric distance over which main-belt comets are found. Here we report observations of P/2010 A2 by the Rosetta spacecraft. We conclude that the trail arose from a single event, rather than a period of cometary activity, in agreement with independent results. The trail is made up of relatively large particles of millimetre to centimetre size that remain close to the parent asteroid. The shape of the trail can be explained by an initial impact ejecting large clumps of debris that disintegrated and dispersed almost immediately. We determine that this was an asteroid collision that occurred around 10 February 2009."

Here, we investigated the mechanism of the DEAD-box protein Mss116 on its natural substrate, the group II intron ai5γ. Group II introns are structurally complex catalytic RNAs considered evolutionarily related to the eukaryotic spliceosome, and an interesting paradigm for large RNA folding. We used single-molecule fluorescence to monitor the effect of Mss116 on folding dynamics of a minimal active construct, ai5γ-D135. The data show that Mss116 stimulates dynamic sampling between states along the folding pathway, an effect previously observed only with high Mg(2+) concentrations. Furthermore, the data indicate that Mss116 promotes folding through discrete ATP-independent and ATP-dependent steps. We propose that Mss116 stimulates group II intron folding through a multi-step process that involves electrostatic stabilization of early intermediates and ATP hydrolysis during the final stages of native state assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1988008712,"SmyD1 is a cardiac- and muscle-specific histone methyltransferase that methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 and regulates gene transcription in early heart development. The unique domain structure characterized by a ""split"" SET domain, a conserved MYND zinc finger, and a novel C-terminal domain (CTD) distinguishes SmyD1 from other SET domain containing methyltransferases. Here we report the crystal structure of full-length SmyD1 in complex with the cofactor analog sinefungin at 2.3 Å. The structure reveals that SmyD1 folds into a wrench-shaped structure with two thick ""grips"" separated by a large, deep concave opening. Importantly, our structural and functional analysis suggests that SmyD1 appears to be regulated by an autoinhibition mechanism, and that unusually spacious target lysine-access channel and the presence of the CTD domain both negatively contribute to the regulation of this cardiovascularly relevant methyltransferase. Furthermore, our structure also provides a structural basis for the interaction between SmyD1 and cardiac transcription factor skNAC, and suggests that the MYND domain may primarily serve as a protein interaction module and cooperate SmyD1 with skNAC to regulate cardiomyocyte growth and maturation. Overall, our data provide novel insights into the mechanism of SmyD1 regulation, which would be helpful in further understanding the role of this protein in heart development and cardiovascular diseases."

It is unclear what specific role Nmnat2 has in the brain that cannot be met by Nmnat1 or -3. To address this question, we have first sought to understand how Nmnat2 interacts with the Golgi, its cellular and developmental protein expression, and its localization in brain cells. We report here that Nmnat2 is a developmentally regulated, low abundance neuronal protein that localizes not only to Golgi but also to vesicles and synaptic compartments. Overexpression of Nmnat2 is toxic to neurons, suggesting that endogenous protein levels must be tightly regulated and providing a rationale for its low abundance. Additional experiments investigate its interaction with Golgi, revealing that Nmnat2 is peripherally attached to the membrane via palmitoylation. Biochemical analysis shows that endogenous Nmnat2 behaves like a membrane protein but is difficult to solubilize suggesting that 1) palmitoylation directs Nmnat2 to detergent resistant membranes or 2) in addition to palmitoylation, Nmnat2 is held at the membrane via protein-protein interaction. Finally, colocalization studies in HeLa cells suggest that Nmnat2 may traffic through an endosomal pathway via Rab7-containing vesicles. The data presented here provide the basis for future investigation of the specific role of Nmnat2 in neuronal NAD metabolism.

Human NMNAT2 (NM_015039) was cloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) as described previously (10Zhang X. Kurnasov O.V. Karthikeyan S. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This construct is referred to here as Nmnat2-EGFP and was used as template for PCR-based mutagenesis to create the C164S/C165S mutant as well as the low homology domain (LHD; see below) deletion mutants. Nmnat2-FLAG and Nmnat2 C164S/C165S-FLAG were generated by subcloning into a C-terminal FLAG vector. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Lentiviral shRNA vectors (pLKO.1-puro) targeted against mouse Nmnat2 and EGFP were purchased from Sigma. Nmnat2-EGFP and its derivatives were subcloned into a modified version of FUGW, a lentivirus expression vector, which, along with the packaging constructs pVSVG and pCMVΔ8.9, were kindly provided by Thomas Südhof (Stanford School of Medicine). Lentiviruses were produced from HEK293T triple-transfected (FuGENE 6) with pVSVG, pCMVΔ8.9, and one of the lentiviral expression vectors described above. Approximately 48 h after transfection, virus containing medium was collected and filtered (0.45 μm) then stored in small aliquots at −80 °C until needed. Viruses were titered by quantitative PCR using a protocol adapted from Salmon and Trono (17Salmon P. Trono D. Curr. Protoc. Neurosci. 2006; 37: 4.21.1-4.21.24Crossref Google Scholar) and Sastry et al. (18Sastry L. Johnson T. Hobson M.J. Smucker B. Cornetta K. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). HEK293T, Neuro-2a, and SH-SY5Y cell lines were purchased from ATCC. U343 and U87 cells were generously donated by Richard Lu (UT Southwestern Medical Center). HeLa cells were a gift from Joachim Seemann (UT Southwestern Medical Center). Cultures were maintained in growth medium containing 10% FBS/DMEM (Invitrogen), except SH-SY5Y, which were maintained in 10% FBS/Advanced minimum essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 110 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated using a previously established protocol (19Encinas M. Iglesias M. Liu Y. Wang H. Muhaisen A. Ceña V. Gallego C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In brief, SH-SY5Y were seeded at low density and sequentially treated with 10 μm retinoic acid (Sigma) in growth medium for 5 days and then 50 ng/ml human BDNF (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium for an additional 7 days. At this point, most cells developed a rounded shape with an extensive network of neurites emanating from clumps of cell bodies. Primary neuronal cultures were generated using standard procedures from cortex dissected from late embryonic (E18) mouse brains. In brief, tissues were cut into small uniform pieces and treated for ∼5 min with warm papain solution (20 units/ml, Worthington; dissolved in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH ∼ 7.2, Invitrogen). To inactivate the papain, tissue fragments were briefly incubated with a solution of 1.25% trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and then rinsed with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution/HEPES buffer. Neurons were dissociated by gentle trituration using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette in neuronal growth medium consisting of Neurobasal supplemented with B-27 and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). For expression analysis, cells were plated on poly-d-lysine (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) coated 6-cm dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/plate. Neurons were fed every 3 days and collected at various time points, as indicated. Primary glial cultures were also derived from the cortex using a similar procedure with the following exceptions; tissue fragments were incubated with papain solution for 15 min, and cultures were maintained in 10% FBS/DMEM. The absence of neurotrophic factors results in the selective loss of neurons. Glial cultures were fed every 7 days and were maintained for ∼21 days before harvesting. For immunofluorescence experiments, cortical neurons were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per coverslip (12 mm diameter, Thermo Fisher Scientific) previously treated with Matrigel (1:100 in PBS, BD Biosciences) and 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma). HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells per coverslip. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, washed several times with PBS, and blocked for 30 min with a solution of 4% BSA (Sigma) and 1% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Incubation with primary antibody was done overnight at 4 °C. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen), and images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Tissues were collected from age-matched mice and washed with PBS and then immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a powder using a mortar and pestle. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then collected with a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets and tissue powder were lysed with cold 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, 1% LDS, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A) and then briefly sonicated to reduce viscosity. Protein concentration was measured using the DC protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Within a given experiment, the same amount of total protein was loaded for each sample. HEK293T cells transiently expressing Nmnat2-FLAG or Nmnat2 C164S/C165S-FLAG were incubated for 6 h in media containing 0.4 mCi/ml [9,10–3H(N)]palmitic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, collected using a rubber policeman, and centrifuged at 800 × g and then lysed with 1% LDS/4 m urea and diluted 1:20 with buffer B (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A). Diluted lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with PBS, bound protein was eluted in a small volume of sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% LDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue). Eluted protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and exposed to Biomax XAR film (Kodak) at −80 °C for 14 days. To enhance detection of radiolabeled protein, polyacrylamide gels were impregnated with 2,5-diphenyloxazole (Sigma) as described by Bonner and Laskey (20Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5619) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for human NMNAT2 and NMNAT2 C164S/C165S was cloned into pMBP-parallel1 (21Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The resulting maltose-binding protein fusion protein was affinity purified using amylose resin (New England BioLabs). After removal of the maltose-binding protein tag by tobacco etch virus protease treatment, Nmnat2 and Nmnat2 C164S/C165S were further purified using a phenyl-Sepharose column and by gel filtration chromatography (GE Healthcare). Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined using a coupled assay adapted from Kurnasov et al. (22Kurnasov O.V. Polanuyer B.M. Ananta S. Sloutsky R. Tam A. Gerdes S.Y. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6906-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures were prepared in parallel containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 115 mm ethanol, 40 mm semicarbazide, 6 units/ml of alcohol dehydrogenase, 5% glycerol, and varying amounts of ATP and NMN. Reactions were started by adding purified Nmnat2 or Nmnat2 C164S/C165S to a final concentration of 0.4 nm. The production of NADH was monitored by measuring absorbance at 340 nm. Apparent values of Km and kcat were calculated using SigmaPlot 11 (Systat Software). Whole mouse brains from adult mice were cut into equally sized pieces and homogenized on ice using a potter-elvehjem homogenizer in buffer A supplemented with 320 mm sucrose. Buffer A consists of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A). To reduce nuclear and whole cell contamination, homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant from this spin is designated as the cytosolic (S100) fraction. The pellet (P100), which is enriched for cytoplasmic membranes, was suspended with buffer A/320 mm sucrose. 100 μl aliquots of P100 (1 mg/ml) were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellets were suspended in 100 μl of buffer A supplemented with one of the following: 320 mm sucrose, 1 m NaCl, 4 m urea, 1% CHAPS, 1% octyl glucoside (OG), or 1% lithium dodecyl sulphate (LDS). Suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. To analyze the hydrophobicity of endogenous Nmnat2, cytoplasmic membranes were extracted with 2% Triton X-114 (EMD Chemicals) overnight on ice. Separation of the detergent and aqueous phases was done essentially as described by Brusca and Radolf (23Brusca J.S. Radolf J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This protocol is based on previously published methods with some modifications (24Butz S. Fernandez-Chacon R.

Whole mouse brains were homogenized in 320 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A) using a potter-elvehjem homogenizer attached to an overhead motor (∼500 rpm). Homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and then centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min to sediment nuclei and unbroken cells (P1). To enrich for synaptosomes and mitochondria, postnuclear supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 15 min. All remaining membranes in the resulting supernatant (S11) were collected by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h (P200). The synaptosome/mitochondria pellet (P11) was washed once with homogenization buffer and then lysed in hypotonic buffer (5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors). This suspension was then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to sediment large membrane fragments (LP1). These membranes (LP1) were further fractionated by flotation through a discontinuous sucrose gradient. The LP1 pellet was suspended with 1.1 m sucrose and formed the bottom layer, with solutions of 0.855 and 0.32 m sucrose layered on top. Gradients were centrifuged at 19,500 rpm for 2.5 h using an SW-41 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Myelin enriched membranes (A) were collected from the 0.32/0.855 m interface and synaptic plasma membranes (B) from the 0.855/1.1 m interface. Mitochondria accumulated at the bottom of the tube in a sticky dark brown pellet (C). Synaptosome supernatant (LS1) was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h to sediment synaptic and other small vesicles (LP2). To evaluate the expression of endogenous Nmnat2, we generated several polyclonal antibodies using either peptides or full-length protein. Following an initial assessment, sera against full-length Nmnat2 was chosen for further analysis. To establish its specificity, we looked for cell lines expressing high levels of Nmnat2 transcript (BioGPS). As a result, Neuro-2a cells, which are a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, were infected with three different shRNA-expressing lentiviruses: two targeted against Nmnat2 and one targeted against EGFP (negative control). Total lysate from Neuro-2a was analyzed by Western blot, and a band migrating at the expected molecular mass (34.4 kDa) is observed in cells infected with control virus but is undetectable in cells infected with shRNA targeted against Nmnat2 (Fig. 1A). Existing studies show that the Nmnat2 transcript is enriched in the brain relative to other tissues (5Sood R. Bonner T.I. Makalowska I. Stephan D.A. Robbins C.M. Connors T.D. Morgenbesser S.D. Su K.

Deeg M.A. Jayaram H.N. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), although the transcript has also been detected in heart and muscle (7Yalowitz J.A. Xiao S. Biju M.P. Antony A.C. Cummings O.W. Deeg M.A. Jayaram H.N. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To further test the specificity of this antibody, we compared lysates from various tissues and identified the same ∼34-kDa band detected in Fig. 1A in brain but not heart or any other tissues examined (Fig. 1B), including skeletal muscle (data not shown). Note that a slightly slower migrating band (marked with an asterisk) is observed in several tissues including brain, suggesting that this is a nonspecific band. To determine whether this band is nonspecific, we compared brain lysate derived from mice in which both Nmnat2 alleles have been trapped. The intensity of the same ∼34-kDa band observed in Fig. 1 (A and B) is reduced ∼50% (Fig. 1C), consistent with a 50% reduction in mRNA expression (p = 0.002, n = 3), whereas the intensity of the same slower migrating band observed in Fig. 1B (asterisk) remains constant. This mouse line was created to analyze the physiological function of Nmnat2. A more detailed analysis of these mice will be provided in future studies. Gene traps often produce null mutants (28Abuin A. Hansen G.M. Zambrowicz B. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2007; 178: 129-147Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar); however, reduced (or even normal) expression of the underlying gene is not uncommon (29Voss A.K. Thomas T. Gruss P. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Voss A.K. Thomas T. Gruss P. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Using Western blot analysis, these data show that an antibody targeted against full-length Nmnat2 detects a band migrating at the expected molecular weight in lysate derived from brain and a neuroblastoma cell line. This band is sensitive to targeted knockdown using either shRNA or a gene-trap insertion. The intensity of this band compared with known amounts of purified recombinant Nmnat2 indicates that the abundance of endogenous protein in the brain is very low (∼0.001% of total protein). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first antibody validated to detect endogenous Nmnat2. Based on its specific expression in the brain, we speculated that Nmnat2 may be further restricted to specific cell types, i.e. neurons or glia. Therefore, we analyzed total lysate from several different cells, including SH-SY5Y, a human neuroblastoma cell line; U87 and U343, which are glioblastoma cell lines; as well as primary cultures. Nmnat2 is expressed in two neuroblastoma cell lines: SH-SY5Y (Fig. 1D), Neuro-2a (Fig. 1A), and primary cortical neurons (Fig. 1E) but is undetectable in primary glia or either of the glioblastoma cell lines tested (Fig. 1D), suggesting that Nmnat2 is more strongly expressed in neurons. Interestingly, Nmnat2 protein levels increase dramatically upon differentiation of SH-SY5Y (Fig. 1D) and during maturation of primary neuronal cultures (Fig. 1E). This effect was also observed in vivo, as Nmnat2 levels in the brain are relatively low at birth and then peak toward the end of the postnatal period (Fig. 1F). This expression profile is similar to Rab5, which regulates endocytosis and early endosome fusion (31Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), and synaptobrevin 2, which is a neuronal protein critical for normal synaptic function (32Schoch S. Deák F. Königstorfer A. Mozhayeva M. Sara Y. Südhof T.C. Kavalali E.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In contrast, neurofilament (heavy chain) increases dramatically at the end of postnatal development (33Shaw G. Weber K. Nature. 1982; 298: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), whereas VCP, a chaperone (34Wang Q. Song C. Li C.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), remains steady throughout. Nmnat2 has previously been reported to localize to the Golgi complex in HeLa cells (8Berger F. Lau C. Dahlmann M. Ziegler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36334-36341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). As it is not predicted to contain a signal sequence or transmembrane domain (or lipid binding domain), we speculated that Nmnat2 localization to this organelle results from peripheral attachment via protein-protein interaction or lipid modification. Nmnat1, -2, and -3 consist of a conserved bipartite Rossman fold linked together by a unique stretch of amino acids in the middle of the primary sequence, which is referred to here as the LHD. Given that LHD (Nmnat1) contains the nuclear localization sequence (35Schweiger M. Hennig K. Lerner F. Niere M. Hirsch-Kauffmann M. Specht T. Weise C. Oei S.L. Ziegler M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we speculated that LHD (Nmnat2) may contain residues essential for its localization. Therefore, we generated several short deletion mutants (Fig. 2A) and compared their localization relative to GM130, a well characterized Golgi marker (36Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). We used lentiviruses for gene delivery to reduce potential artifacts due to high level expression resulting from transient transfection. The localization pattern of LHD-Δ2 closely resembles full-length Nmnat2, whereas LHD-Δ1, LHD-Δ4, and LHD-Δ5 retain Golgi localization but have increased cytoplasmic signal (Fig. 2B). This suggests that residues 109–124 (LHD-Δ1) and 170–193 (LHD-Δ4 and -Δ5) may contribute but are not required for Golgi localization. In contrast, LHD-Δ3 does not colocalize with GM130 and shows diffuse cytoplasmic localization. Among the residues deleted in the LHD-Δ3 mutant (amino acids 143–169), we focused on Cys164 and Cys165, given that 1) they are within a highly conserved cluster (Fig. 3A) and 2) cysteines are targets of prenylation and palmitoylation (37Resh M.D. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Because prenylation occurs on C-terminal CAAX motifs, we directly investigated the possibility that Nmnat2 is palmitoylated using metabolic labeling. Nmnat2, but not Nmnat2 C164S/C165S, labels with [3H]palmitate, indicating that 1) Nmnat2 is palmitoylated and 2) Cys164 and Cys165 are required for this modification (Fig. 3B). To determine whether palmitoylation is required for Golgi localization, we compared the localization of Nmnat2 C164S/C165S relative to GM130. In contrast to wild-type control, but identical to LHD-Δ3 (see Fig. 2B), Nmnat2 C164S/C165S appears diffuse in the cytoplasm and does not colocalize with GM130 (Fig. 3C). This suggests that Nmnat2 C164S/C165S is soluble. To investigate this possibility, infected cells were treated prior to fixation with digitonin, a mild detergent that selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane, allowing soluble components of the cytoplasm to rapidly diffuse out of the cell. Under these conditions, cytoplasmic Nmnat2 C164S/C165S and EGFP are washed out, whereas wild-type Nmnat2 is retained in the cell (Fig. 3D). Although Cys164 and Cys165 are likely targets of palmitoylation, these residues could be necessary for Nmnat2 to acquire and/or maintain its tertiary structure. To test this possibility, we compa"
https://openalex.org/W2017517534,"The KIAA0319 gene has been associated with reading disability in several studies. It encodes a plasma membrane protein with a large, highly glycosylated, extracellular domain. This protein is proposed to function in adhesion and attachment and thought to play an important role during neuronal migration in the developing brain. We have previously proposed that endocytosis of this protein could constitute an important mechanism to regulate its function. Here we show that KIAA0319 undergoes ectodomain shedding and intramembrane cleavage. At least five different cleavage events occur, four in the extracellular domain and one within the transmembrane domain. The ectodomain shedding processing cleaves the extracellular domain, generating several small fragments, including the N-terminal region with the Cys-rich MANEC domain. It is possible that these fragments are released to the extracellular medium and trigger cellular responses. The intramembrane cleavage releases the intracellular domain from its membrane attachment. Our results suggest that this cleavage event is not carried out by γ-secretase, the enzyme complex involved in similar processing in many other type I proteins. The soluble cytoplasmic domain of KIAA0319 is able to translocate to the nucleus, accumulating in nucleoli after overexpression. This fragment has an unknown role, although it could be involved in regulation of gene expression. The absence of DNA-interacting motifs indicates that such a function would most probably be mediated through interaction with other proteins, not by direct DNA binding. These results suggest that KIAA0319 not only has a direct role in neuronal migration but may also have additional signaling functions."
https://openalex.org/W2153827414,"We have determined the human male specific lethal 3 (hMSL3) chromo-barrel domain structure by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.5 Å (r = 0.226, R(free) = 0.270). hMSL3 contains a canonical methyllysine binding pocket made up of residues Tyr-31, Phe-56, Trp-59, and Trp-63. A six-residue insertion between strands β(1) and β(2) of the hMSL3 chromo-barrel domain directs the side chain of Glu-21 into the methyllysine binding pocket where it hydrogen bonds to the NH group of a bound cyclohexylamino ethanesulfonate buffer molecule, likely mimicking interactions with a histone tail dimethyllysine residue. In vitro binding studies revealed that both the human and Drosophila MSL3 chromo-barrel domains bind preferentially to peptides representing the mono or dimethyl isoform of lysine 20 on the histone H4 N-terminal tail (H4K20Me(1) or H4K20Me(2)). Mutation of Tyr-31 to Ala in the hMSL3 methyllysine-binding cage resulted in weaker in vitro binding to H4K20Me(1). The same mutation in the msl3 gene compromised male survival in Drosophila. Combined mutation of Glu-21 and Pro-22 to Ala in hMSL3 resulted in slightly weaker in vitro binding to H4K20Me(1), but the corresponding msl3 mutation had no effect on male survival in Drosophila. We propose MSL3 plays an important role in targeting the male specific lethal complex to chromatin in both humans and flies by binding to H4K20Me(1). Binding studies on the related dMRG15 chromo-barrel domain revealed that MRG15 prefers binding to H4K20Me(3)."

Rutter J. Rutter G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8319-8324Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Insight into the physiological role of PASK as a metabolic regulator came from in vivo studies of PASK-deficient mice. Mice lacking PASK were resistant to high fat diet-induced lipid accumulation and insulin resistance (14Hao H.X. Cardon C.M. Swiatek W. Cooksey R.C. Smith T.L. Wilde J. Boudina S. Abel E.D. McClain D.A. Rutter J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15466-15471Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, both in yeast and mammals, PASK coordinates the utilization of nutrients and energy in response to metabolic state. The major mode by which PASK signals to regulate energy utilization is almost certainly via phosphorylation of protein substrates catalyzed by a canonical C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain. In contrast, the mechanism by which PASK senses cellular metabolic status is unknown, but likely relates to its N-terminal PAS domain. PAS domains serve as sensory modules for a variety of intracellular cues, including light, oxygen, redox state, and various metabolites (15Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coordinated with this sensing function, PAS domains trigger appropriate cellular responses via regulation of attached functional domains (15Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with other PAS domains, NMR-based structural studies of the PAS domain of PASK showed that it can bind specific small molecules (16Amezcua C.A. Harper S.M. Rutter J. Gardner K.H. Structure. 2002; 10: 1349-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The PAS domain of PASK also directly binds to and inhibits the catalytic activity of the kinase domain either in cis or in trans (16Amezcua C.A. Harper S.M. Rutter J. Gardner K.H. Structure. 2002; 10: 1349-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Rutter J. Michnoff C.H. Harper S.M. Gardner K.H. McKnight S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Together, these data and precedents set by the studies of other PAS domains provide support for the hypothesis that a cellular PAS domain ligand regulates PASK kinase activity through modulation of the PAS domain-kinase domain interaction. Most protein kinases require phosphorylation on serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues within the activation loop (or P loop) of the kinase domain to achieve full activation. Here, we provide biochemical and crystallographic evidence that activation loop phosphorylation does not play a major role in PASK activation. We also describe structural adaptations that enable kinase activity in the absence of phosphorylation. Finally, we describe the peptide substrate preference of PASK and the structural features that dictate substrate selection. Residues 977–1300 of human PASK (numbered relative to GenBank sequence AAK69752) were amplified by PCR and cloned into a custom TOPO-adapted baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen) based on pFastBac. The NYSGXRC target and clone name are NYSGXRC-9501a and 9501a6KWg1h1, respectively, and the plasmid is available through the National Institutes of Health-funded PSI Material Repository. The expressed protein is fused to a noncleavable C-terminal His6 tag so the final protein is: MAL + PASK (977–1300, C1266F) + EGHHHHHH. (Several published PASK sequences have a cysteine at position 1266, however our clone and the GenBank Refseq have a phenylalanine at this position. Phe1266 is among the last residues visible in our x-ray crystal structure. cDNA from 9501a6KWg1h1 was isolated and sequence verified prior to expression.) Recombinant baculovirus incorporating the kinase cDNA construct was generated by transposition with the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen catalog no. 10359-016). PASK was expressed in Sf9 cells in a 48-h 12-liter fermentation at 29 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C. Cell pellets produced from 3 liters of Sf9 insect cell culture expressing the C-terminal His-tagged human PAS kinase domain (residues 977–1300, C1266F) were suspended in 250 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 250 mm NaCl, and six tablets of Roche Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (catalog no. 1873580)). The suspension was stirred for 1 h, and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min (39,800 × g). The supernatant was collected and incubated with 10 ml of a 50% slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen catalog no. 30250), preequilibrated with the wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 25 mm imidazole), for 30 min with gentle stirring. The sample was then poured into a drip column and washed with 50 ml of wash buffer to remove unbound proteins. PAS kinase was eluted using 25 ml of elution buffer (wash buffer with 500 mm imidazole). The eluted fraction was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a GE Healthcare HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 preparation grade column (catalog no. 17-1069-01) preequilibrated with gel filtration buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm DTT). Fractions containing PAS kinase were combined and concentrated to 10 mg/ml by centrifugation in an Amicon Ultra-15 10,000-Da MWCO centrifugal filter unit (catalog no. UFC901024). Electrospray mass spectrometry was used to obtain an accurate mass of the protein purified to confirm its identity and to define the phosphorylation status of the protein (∼50% was unphosphorylated, 40% singly phosphorylated, and 10% double phosphorylated). The PASK protein (NYSGXRC clone 9501a6KWg1h1, PID 17274-3), concentrated to 9 mg/ml, was incubated with 2 mm ATP and 4 mm MgCl2 on ice for 15 min, centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, then filtered through a 0.2-μm spin filter. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained via sitting drop vapor diffusion from 18% PEG 3350, 275 mm calcium acetate, and 4% butanediol (1 μl of protein plus 1 μl of crystallization solution). Crystals were frozen by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen following cryoprotection via addition of 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. X-ray diffraction data to 2.3 Å resolution was obtained from frozen crystals at the Advanced Photon Source beamline LRL-CAT 31-ID. Data were processed using the CCP4 program package (20CCP4Acta Cryst. 1994; D50: 760-763Google Scholar). The structure was determined via molecular replacement using Phaser (18McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (13886) Google Scholar) with a search model derived from the structure of human MAP microtubule affinity-regulating kinase MARK2 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1ZMU). The atomic model was built using Xfit (19McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar), and the structure was refined to convergence using Refmac (20CCP4Acta Cryst. 1994; D50: 760-763Google Scholar). NCS restraints were used in the initial rounds of refinement and model building but were released in the final stages of refinement. The diffraction spots were streaky in one direction, resulting in a high Rmerge, and leading to somewhat higher refinement R-factors. Structure determination statistics are provided in Table 1. We also calculated root mean square deviation values among the six chains of PASK within the asymmetric unit. The six independent copies of the polypeptide adopt very similar tertiary structures, with the exception of the region surrounding the disordered loop near residues 1034–1040 in chain B–F. The root mean square deviation for 276 CA atoms varies from 0.23 to 0.50 Å between chain A and each of the other chains. All structural figures in the manuscripts are prepared using PyMOL three-dimensional visualization software from DeLano Scientific (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 0.99rc6; Schrödinger, LLC).TABLE 1Structure statistics for the catalytic domain of human PASK (PDB code 3DLS)Data collection and processing BeamlineLRL-CAT, Advanced Photon Source Wavelength (Å)0.97929 Space groupP1 Cell dimensions (Å, °)a = 85.8, b = 85.8, c = 94.2, α = 77.3, β = 77.5, γ = 60.1 Molecules/asymmetric unit6 Resolution (Å)31.2-2.3 (2.42-2.30) Observed reflections368,548 Unique reflections96,811 Mean Rmerge (last shell)0.127 (0.528) Mean redundancy3.8 Completeness (%) (last shell)97.2 (96.4) Mean I/σ(I) (last shell)7.1 (2.1)Structure refinement Rwork0.241 Rfree0.297 Ramachandran plot (%) Most favored regions90.9 Disallowed regions0.0 Amino acid residues1693 rmsdarmsd, root mean square deviation. bond length (Å)0.009 rmsd angle (°)1.256 Mean B value protein/ADP per Mg per solvent (Å2)37.5/30.4/26.1/33.8 Nucleotides6 Magnesium ions19a rmsd, root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Cloning of human WT and K1028R PASK into a V5-tagged mammalian expression vector (pcDNA3.1-V5/His) was described previously (17Rutter J. Michnoff C.H. Harper S.M. Gardner K.H. McKnight S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All mutations were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, and sequences were verified. HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were done using FuGENE 6 (Roche) reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol. For IP kinase assays, HEK293T cells transfected with various PASK-V5 constructs were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5% sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged, and V5-tagged PASK was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) conjugated with protein G-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by twice with kinase assay buffer (18 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 1 mm DTT). Kinase reactions were performed by adding 150 ng of bacterially purified Ugp1 and 1 μCi/reaction of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were terminated by adding SDS-buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane followed by autoradiography. HEK293T cells were transfected with various PASK plasmids. At 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM (Invitrogen) followed by incubation with 1.0 mCi of 32P. Cells were washed with phosphate-free DMEM to remove unincorporated 32P, lysed using lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunocomplexes were washed with buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.02% NaN3) containing high salt (1 m NaCl and 0.1% BSA) followed by low salt (150 mm NaCl). Immunoprecipitated PASK was released by SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, and imaged by autoradiography. PASK substrate specificity was determined by screening a combinatorial peptide library, essentially as described (33Hutti J.E. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The peptide library consisted of a set of 198 peptides having the general sequence YAXXXXXS/TXXXXAGKK (biotin), where X is an equimolar mixture of the 17 amino acids (excluding cysteine, serine, and threonine), and S/T is an even mixture of serine and threonine. In each peptide, one of the X positions was fixed as one of the 20 unmodified amino acids or phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine. Peptides were arrayed in 384-well plates and incubated with PASK and [γ-32P]ATP for 2 h at 30 °C. Aliquots (2 μl) of the reactions were transferred to a streptavidin-coated membrane, which was washed as described, dried, and exposed to a phosphor storage screen. To achieve full activity, most protein kinases require phosphorylation of one or more amino acids in the activation loop within the kinase domain (21Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). PASK possesses a threonine residue (Thr1161) in the site analogous to the canonical phosphorylation site in many other kinases. To determine the significance of activation loop phosphorylation for PASK activity in vivo, we mutated Thr1161 to alanine in V5-tagged human PASK and studied kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. The activity of the T1161A mutant was compared with wild-type (WT) PASK in an immunoprecipitation kinase assay using the in vitro PASK substrate, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Ugp1) (9Smith T.L. Rutter J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 491-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, WT PASK exhibited strong Ugp1 phosphorylation and autophosphorylation activity. As expected, a K1028R mutant of PASK, which lacks a conserved lysine in the ATP binding pocket, showed no autophosphorylation or Ugp1 phosphorylation activity. Surprisingly, the T1161A mutation did not affect PASK activity as assessed by either autophosphorylation or Ugp1 phosphorylation. To determine whether the T1161A mutation affects PASK phosphorylation kinetics, we measured Ugp1 phosphorylation over a 30-min time course (Fig. 1B). Again, the catalytic activity of the T1161A PASK mutant was indistinguishable from WT PASK. We conclude that, unlike many protein kinases, in vitro activity of PASK does not require activation loop phosphorylation. The in vivo targets of mammalian PASK remain unknown. PASK does phosphorylate itself in cells, however, and we have used autophosphorylation as a measure of in vivo PASK activity. As illustrated in Fig. 1, C and D, WT PASK is robustly phosphorylated in cultured HEK293T cells. Phosphorylation of the catalytically inactive K1028R mutant was decreased by ∼70% relative to WT. This reduction in phosphorylation is indicative of impaired autophosphorylation. In contrast, the T1161A mutation had no effect on PASK phosphorylation in vivo. These findings demonstrate that activation loop phosphorylation is not required for kinase activity of PASK in vitro or in vivo. In addition, mass spectrometry analysis of human PASK purified either from insect cells or human HEK293T cells did not show the presence of phosphothreonine 1161 within PASK (data not shown). These findings suggest that PASK has adapted structural features that enable kinase activity in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation. To understand the structural features that enable PASK activity in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation, we determined the x-ray crystal structure of a portion of human PASK encompassing the kinase domain (residues 977–1300) bound to ADP at 2.3 Å resolution (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2, the kinase domain of human PASK adopts the classical two-lobe structure typical of eukaryotic protein kinases. The N-terminal lobe consists primarily of β-sheets, whereas the C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical. Within the PASK active site, two Mg2+ ions, and ADP, are clearly visible in the electron density map (supplemental Fig. 3A). ADP appears to be the product of hydrolysis of ATP, which was included in the crystallization solution. The N-terminal lobe of protein kinases is typically composed of five β-strands and the αC helix. In contrast, the PASK domain contains an additional two-stranded β-hairpin (termed βH1 and βH2) and a truncated αC helix (Fig. 2B). To understand the sequence-structure relationship leading to the unusual secondary structure of the PASK N-terminal lobe, we performed a structure-based sequence alignment of human protein kinases against PASK using DaliLite (22Holm L. Kääriäinen S. Rosenström P. Schenkel A. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2). Interestingly, the PIM1 proto-oncogene protein kinase showed the highest degree of similarity with PASK and, like PASK, also contains an additional β-hairpin, which is absent in PKA (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2) (23Bullock A.N. Debreczeni J. Amos A.L. Knapp S. Turk B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41675-41682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our structure-based alignment showed that PIM1 (and its close relatives PIM2 and PIM3) and PASK share a tryptophan residue at the beginning of the βH1 strand (Fig. 3A; PASK, Trp1040; PIM1, Trp168) that is absent in kinases lacking the β-hairpin structural motif (supplemental Fig. 2, shaded green). The tryptophan residue is well ordered in the crystal structure and is clearly visible in the electron density map (supplemental Fig. 3B). It is possible that the bulky aromatic side chain of tryptophan may destabilize the presumptive αC helix, thereby shortening the αC helix and stabilizing the β-hairpin structure. Although the side chains of Lys1032, Val1035, and Thr1050 participate, a phenylalanine (PASK, Phe1077; PIM1, Phe207) from the β5 strand contributes much of the hydrophobic environment surrounding the βH1 tryptophan (Fig. 3A). This phenylalanine is structurally conserved among PASK and all three PIM isoforms (supplemental Fig. 2, shaded blue). The importance of this unusual secondary structure in regulating kinase activity or substrate binding remains unclear (see “Discussion”). It does not, however, affect the highly conserved position, orientation or Lys1028 salt bridge of the catalytically important Glu1052 (Fig. 3B). Activation loop phosphorylation is a requirement for full activation of most eukaryotic protein kinases (21Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar), but PASK activity was not affected by mutation of the activation loop threonine Thr1161 (Fig. 1). One important function of activation loop phosphorylation is to enable the formation of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain (Fig. 4A, left) (21Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 24Komander D. Kular G. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18797-18802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). This interlobe interaction is thought to be essential for stabilizing the active conformation and substrate-binding interface (24Komander D. Kular G. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18797-18802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In protein kinases that do not require activation loop phosphorylation, an alternative interlobe interaction must be enabled by sequence or structural changes. For example, Thr153 in the Mg2+-binding loop of the C-terminal lobe of CHK1 forms a hydrogen bond with Lys54 of the N-terminal lobe to stabilize the active conformation (Fig. 4A, right) (26Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In our PASK structure, we found that Tyr1152 from the Mg2+-binding loop forms a hydrogen bond with Arg1058 from the αC-helix of the N-terminal lobe (Fig. 4B). To determine whether this interaction is required to stabilize the active conformation, we assayed PASK mutated at either Tyr1152 or Arg1058. The R1058A mutant, but not the R1058K mutant, showed a significant loss of PASK activity as measured by diminished Ugp1 phosphorylation and autophosphorylation (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the Y1152F mutant also exhibited significantly lower kinase activity. The residue corresponding to Y1152 is not found in most protein kinases, suggesting that the R1058-Y1152 interaction may represent a unique structural feature of PASK that stabilizes the active conformation in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation. In addition to promoting interlobe interaction, activation loop phosphorylation often plays a role in substrate binding and catalysis. Activation loop phosphoserine/threonine hydrogen bonds with side chains from catalytic residues, stabilizing a catalytically active conformation (27Kornev A.P. Haste N.M. Taylor S.S. Eyck L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17783-17788Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic protein kinases (referred to as RD kinases) contain a highly conserved HRD catalytic loop between the β6 and β7 strands, corresponding to His1126, Arg1127, and Asp1128 in PASK. Typically, the activation loop phospho-group interacts directly with the arginine of the HRD loop and stabilizes a conformation favorable for catalysis. In addition to the phosphorylated activation loop, the Mg2+-binding loop formed by Asp1146, Phe1147, and Gly1148 residues also interacts with the HRD catalytic loop. For many activation loop phosphorylation-dependent RD kinases, the position three residues C-terminal to the conserved DFG sequence (DFG+3) is often occupied by a lysine, which projects into the RD pocket (Fig. 5A, inverted triangle) (25Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The negatively charged activation loop phosphate is thought to neutralize the positive charge repulsion of arginine from the RD pocket and the DFG+3 lysine, thereby stabilizing a catalytically active RD pocket conformation (25Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 27Kornev A.P. Haste N.M. Taylor S.S. Eyck L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17783-17788Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the PASK and PIM1/2/3 sequences, this lysine is replaced by alanine (Ala1151 in PASK, marked by inverted triangle), possibly enabling the active conformation of the RD pocket arginine in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation. It is interesting to note that CHK1, another RD kinase that does not require activation loop phosphorylation, also has an uncharged residue (threonine) at this site. This difference is responsible for maintaining the active conformation of CHK1 in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation (26Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of the corresponding alanine in PASK, we generated an A1151K mutant of PASK. As shown in Fig. 5B, the A1151K mutation significantly decreased Ugp1 phosphorylation and PASK autophosphorylation. Enzymatic impairment was almost completely reversed by combining it with a phosphomimetic substitution of the activation loop threonine (T1161E) (Fig. 5B). It is noteworthy that the T1161E single mutation did not affect PASK activity, consistent with our observation that Thr1161 phosphorylation is not a major regulator of PASK activity. As seen in x-ray structures of other activated protein kinases (27Kornev A.P. Haste N.M. Taylor S.S. Eyck L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17783-17788Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), Asp1146 and the Gly1148 main chain of the PASK Mg2+-binding loop form a hydrogen bond, enabling Asp1146 to interact with Mg2+ and the nucleotide phosphates (Fig. 6"
https://openalex.org/W2109837531,"Crystal structures of the unique hexokinase KlHxk1 of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis were determined using eight independent crystal forms. In five crystal forms, a symmetrical ring-shaped homodimer was observed, corresponding to the physiological dimer existing in solution as shown by small-angle x-ray scattering. The dimer has a head-to-tail arrangement such that the small domain of one subunit interacts with the large domain of the other subunit. Dimer formation requires favorable interactions of the 15 N-terminal amino acids that are part of the large domain with amino acids of the small domain of the opposite subunit, respectively. The head-to-tail arrangement involving both domains of the two KlHxk1 subunits is appropriate to explain the reduced activity of the homodimer as compared with the monomeric enzyme and the influence of substrates and products on dimer formation and dissociation. In particular, the structure of the symmetrical KlHxk1 dimer serves to explain why phosphorylation of conserved residue Ser-15 may cause electrostatic repulsions with nearby negatively charged residues of the adjacent subunit, thereby inducing a dissociation of the homologous dimeric hexokinases KlHxk1 and ScHxk2. Two complex structures of KlHxk1 with bound glucose provide a molecular model of substrate binding to the open conformation and the subsequent classical domain closure motion of yeast hexokinases. The entirety of the novel data extends the current concept of glucose signaling in yeast and complements the induced-fit model by integrating the events of N-terminal phosphorylation and dissociation of homodimeric yeast hexokinases. Crystal structures of the unique hexokinase KlHxk1 of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis were determined using eight independent crystal forms.

The head-to-tail arrangement involving both domains of the two KlHxk1 subunits is appropriate to explain the reduced activity of the homodimer as compared with the monomeric enzyme and the influence of substrates and products on dimer formation and dissociation. In particular, the structure of the symmetrical KlHxk1 dimer serves to explain why phosphorylation of conserved residue Ser-15 may cause electrostatic repulsions with nearby negatively charged residues of the adjacent subunit, thereby inducing a dissociation of the homologous dimeric hexokinases KlHxk1 and ScHxk2. Two complex structures of KlHxk1 with bound glucose provide a molecular model of substrate binding to the open conformation and the subsequent classical domain closure motion of yeast hexokinases. The entirety of the novel data extends the current concept of glucose signaling in yeast and complements the induced-fit model by integrating the events of N-terminal phosphorylation and dissociation of homodimeric yeast hexokinases. The enzymes of the hexokinase family catalyze the intracellular trapping and the initiation of metabolism of glucose, fructose, and mannose. In addition to their role in glycolysis, an increasing number of yeast, plant, and mammalian hexokinases have been found to represent multifunctional proteins that are implicated in glucose sensing and signaling (1Moreno F.

Contrary to the situation in bakers' yeast, glucose and fructose limitation causes the translocation of the mammalian hexokinase isoenzyme IV (also referred to as “glucokinase” or hexokinase D) to the nucleus of the liver parenchymal cell where it binds to its regulatory protein, GKRP, and retranslocates when glucose is abundantly available again (16Agius L. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which glucokinase contributes to glucose sensing and regulation of insulin secretion in the pancreatic β-cell is understood only in part at present (17Matschinsky F.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Despite steadily increasing evidence for multiple hexokinase-protein interactions and translocations to subcellular structures in yeast (9Peláez R. Herrero P. Moreno F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20548-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and mammals (17Matschinsky F.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), the exploration of the structural basis enabling hexokinases to fulfill their respective functions remains a challenging task. The carbon source-dependent nucleocytoplasmic translocation of ScHxk2 in the fermentative yeast S. cerevisiae has been studied in detail using genetic, immunological, and microscopic approaches (9Peláez R. Herrero P. Moreno F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20548-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because of the observation that glucose limitation stimulates both the phosphorylation of ScHxk2 at Ser-15 in vivo (18Vojtek A.B. Fraenkel D.G. Eur. J.

Chem. 2009; 284: 20548-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the covalent modification at Ser-15 and subsequent changes of the oligomeric state have been presumed to be involved in the control of ScHxk2 regulatory functions (9Peláez R.

Kriegel T.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, no data are available on the covalent modification and/or intracellular distribution of KlHxk1 in the nonfermentative yeast K. lactis. The two hexokinases exhibit 73% sequence identity (22Kettner K. Müller E.C. Otto A. Rödel G. Breunig K.D. Kriegel T.M. FEMS Yeast Res. 2007; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and dimerization of the K. lactis enzyme apparently decreases its glucose kinase activity (23Bär D. Golbik R. Hübner G.

Hübner G. Kriegel T.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, the monomer-dimer equilibrium of both hexokinases depends in a comparable manner on the enzyme concentration and on the presence of substrates and products with glucose most strongly inducing homodimer dissociation (21Golbik R.

To explore the interrelation between the structure and function(s) of hexokinases, crystal structures of isoenzymes ScHxk1 (hexokinase A or PI) and ScHxk2 (hexokinase B or PII) from the eukaryotic model organism S. cerevisiae have been determined, which have rendered these enzymes a classical example of substrate-induced domain closure motion in enzyme catalysis (24Anderson C.M. McDonald R.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Bennett Jr., W.S. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 4848-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 26McDonald R.C. Steitz T.A. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Bennett Jr., W.S. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The molecular bases of the description of this closure motion are the structures of ScHxk1 in complex with glucose (PDB entry, 1HKG; the glucose molecule is not present in the PDB file) (25Bennett Jr., W.S. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 4848-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and of the substrate-free ScHxk2 isoenzyme (PDB entry, 2YHX) (28Anderson C.M. Stenkamp R.E. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 15-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). More recently, structures have been determined to higher resolution for the two proteins. In the case of ScHxk1, the same crystal form was analyzed (PDB entry, 3B8A) (29Kuser P. Cupri F. Bleicher L. Polikarpov I. Proteins. 2008; 72: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas a new crystal form was obtained for ScHxk2 (PDB entry, 1IG8) (30Kuser P.R. Krauchenco S. Antunes O.A. Polikarpov I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20814-20821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Remarkably, in all of these structures the enzymes are present in the monomeric state, even though ScHxk1 and ScHxk2 are known to form dimers (31Hoggett J.G. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, dimeric arrangements have been observed in crystal forms BI (32Steitz T.A. Fletterick R.J. Hwang K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 78: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and BII (33Anderson W.F. Fletterick R.J. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) of ScHxk2; however, these dimers are asymmetric and consist of two subunits related by screw axes of 156° (BI) and 180° (BII) rotation and 13.8 Å (BI) and 3.6 Å (BII) translation. Their calculated radii of gyration are 40.2 Å (BI) and 31.3 Å (BII). Only the radius of the latter crystal dimer is in agreement with the radius of gyration of 30–31.3 Å determined from small-angle x-ray scattering of dimeric ScHxk2 in solution (34McDonald R.C. Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2942-2943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether the asymmetric dimer in crystal form BII corresponds to the dimer observed in solution, as oligomers usually exhibit a closed symmetry. The present article describes for the first time a symmetric homodimeric yeast hexokinase structure as determined for full-length KlHxk1 by x-ray crystallography using several crystal forms. Small-angle x-ray scattering of the enzyme in solution confirmed the dimer structure observed in the KlHxk1 crystals. Taking into consideration the high degree of sequence identity and the similar oligomerization behavior of KlHxk1 and ScHxk2, as well as the detection of KlHxk1 phosphorylation at Ser-15 in preliminary studies, the novel structural model seems appropriate to explain the regulation of KlHxk1 and, by analogy, of ScHxk2 function(s) by covalent modification and modulation of the monomer-dimer equilibrium. In addition, the crystal structure analysis of open and closed forms of KlHxk1 including enzyme-glucose complexes as presented here allows for a re-evaluation of the induced-fit model of yeast hexokinase-glucose interaction using the same isoenzyme as the object of study. KlHxk1 was prepared as described previously (23Bär D. Golbik R. Hübner G. Lilie H. Müller E.C. Naumann M. Otto A. Reuter R. Breunig K.D. Kriegel T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39280-39286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A final gel filtration chromatography step was performed using a Superdex 200 16/60 pg column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF, pH 7.4 (chromatography buffer), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin fraction V (lot 3X04340, Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) as a standard. Details of the preparation procedure and analytics of Ser-15-phosphorylated KlHxk1 will be described elsewhere. 5K. Kettner, A. Otto, E.-C. Müller, R. Golbik, H. Lilie, and T. M.

Briefly, the Ser-15-phosphorylated enzyme was isolated from K. lactis strain JA6Δ rag5R transformed with multicopy vector pTSRAG5 carrying the RAG5 gene and the selection marker URA3 (23Bär D.

Cells were grown in yeast nitrogen base (YNB)/dextrose medium lacking uracil and supplemented with amino acids according to Sherman et al. (46Cohen G.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar) at pH 5.5 and 30 °C until an A 600 of 2 was reached. The initial concentration of glucose was 2%. The isolated enzymes were subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to verify their molecular identity and native state (see supplemental Fig. 2) and, in the case of phosphorylated KlHxk1, to check phosphorylation at Ser-15. KlHxk1 was crystallized in different crystal forms. The crystallographic parameters of seven crystal forms were described previously (36Kuettner E.B. Kriegel T.M. Keim A. Naumann M. Sträter N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol Cryst. Commun. 2007; 63: 430-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For eight crystal forms, full data sets were collected, and the crystal structures were refined (Table 1). All crystals were grown at 291 K starting from an initial concentration of unphosphorylated KlHxk1 of 10 mg/ml. In the case of crystal form XI, consisting of Ser-15-phosphorylated KlHxk1, the initial protein concentration was 7.5 mg/ml. Further details of the crystallization conditions are listed in Table 1. For cryoprotection, crystals were transferred to dried paraffin oil (37Riboldi-Tunnicliffe A. Hilgenfeld R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 1003-1005Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or to a buffer containing the reservoir solution and up to 20% glycerol. The glycerol concentration was increased stepwise 5% at a time with a soaking time of about 30 s. Alternatively, the crystals were plunged directly into liquid nitrogen without further preparation (see Table 1). Data were collected at beamlines 14.2 and 14.3 of BESSY II (Berlin, Germany), at EMBL beamline X11 of DORIS III at DESY (Hamburg, Germany), or at an in-house RU-H3R-type x-ray generator (Rigaku, Kemsing, United Kingdom).

A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). The model was improved by automatic model building in ARP/wARP (43Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) and manual rebuilding in COOT (44Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar). The remaining crystal forms (II–IV and VII–IX) were phased using the model of the crystal form I structure for molecular replacement. After iterative rounds of model building with COOT (44Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar) and refinement in REFMAC5 (45Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar), the Rwork/free factors showed reasonable values (Table 1). For TLS refinement, the two domains of each polypeptide chain were defined as the rigid bodies (large domain, residues 2–76 and 210–456; small domain, residues 77–209 and 457–485). Buffer and solvent molecules were built according to 2FoFc- and FoFc-type electron density maps or anomalous difference electron density maps (sulfur or phosphorus atoms from CHES, sulfates, and phosphates) as derived from in-house data collection. Structures were superimposed based on Cα positions with the program ALIGN (46Cohen G.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). For calculating interdomain screw axes, two structures were aligned first on the basis of their large domains. The interdomain screw axis was determined subsequently by superposition of the small domains. Thus, the interdomain screw axis was used to describe the conformational change between two hexokinase structures as a rigid body movement of the two domains by rotation around and translation along the axis. The angle between two screw axes (vectors) was calculated as the scalar product. Sequence comparisons were performed with the structural alignment option in the program INDONESIA. 6D. Madsen, P. Johansson, and G. J. Kleywegt, unpublished data. The buried surface area was determined by subtracting the accessible surface area of the dimer from the sum of the accessible surface areas of its constituting subunits using the program DSSP (47Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12186) Google Scholar). The dimer contact area was calculated as half of the buried surface area. All molecular figures (Figs. 1, A–B, 1D, 2B, 3, A–B, 4, A–B, 5, A–D, 6, A–B, and 7, A–B) were generated with the program PyMOL.

In Escherichia coli, H+ binding and release occur at Asp-61 in the middle of the second transmembrane helix (TMH) of Fo subunit c.

Cd2+ inhibited the activity of all Ag+-sensitive Cys on the cytoplasmic side of the TMHs, and three of these substitutions were also sensitive to inhibition by MTS reagents. On the other hand, Cd2+ did not inhibit the activities of substitutions at residues 119 and 120 on the periplasmic side of TMH2, and residues 214 and 215 in TMH4 and 252 in TMH5 at the center of the membrane. When inside-out membrane vesicles from each of these substitutions were sonicated during Cd2+ treatment to expose the periplasmic surface, the ATPase-coupled H+ transport activity was strongly inhibited. The periplasmic access to N214C and Q252C, and their positioning in the protein at the a-c interface, is consistent with previous proposals that these residues may be involved in gating H+ access from the periplasmic half-channel to Asp-61 during the protonation step.

IntroductionThe H+-transporting F1Fo ATP synthases of oxidative phosphorylation utilize the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient of H+ or Na+ to mechanically drive the synthesis of ATP via two coupled rotary motors in the F1 and Fo sectors of the enzyme (1Yoshida M.

In the complete membranous enzyme, the rotation of the c-ring is proposed to be driven by H+ transport at the subunit a/c interface, with ring movement then driving rotation of subunit γ within the α3β3 hexamer of F1 to cause conformational changes in the catalytic sites leading to synthesis and release of ATP (1Yoshida M.

Interaction of the conserved Arg-210 residue in aTMH4 with cTMH2 is thought to be critical during the deprotonation-protonation cycle of cAsp-61 (18Cain B.D. J. Bioenerg.

Both reagents react preferentially with the thiolate form of the Cys side chain that is expected in a polar, aqueous environment. Two regions of aqueous access were found with distinctly different properties. One region extending from Asn-214 and Arg-210 near the center of the membrane to the cytoplasmic surface of TMH4 contains Cys residues that are sensitive to inhibition by both NEM and Ag+ (Fig. 1). A second set of Ag+-sensitive but NEM-inaccessible residues mapped to the opposite face and periplasmic side of TMH4. Ag+-sensitive and NEM-insensitive Cys residues were also found in TMHs 2, 3, and 5, extending from the center of the membrane to the periplasm. The Ag+-sensitive/NEM-insensitive residues in TMHs 2, 3, 4, and 5 cluster at the interior of the four-helix bundle predicted by cross-linking (Ref. 26Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and Fig. 2), and could interact to form a continuous aqueous pathway extending from the periplasmic surface to the center of the membrane.FIGURE 2Cross-sectional view of positions of Ag+-sensitive residues in transmembrane regions of subunit a. Cys substitutions showing >90% inhibition of ATP-driven ACMA quenching on treatment with 40 μm Ag+ are depicted in red. The orientation of TMHs 2–4 in a four-helix bundle is suggested by disulfide cross-link formation between the residues connected by fine solid lines. The green shaded areas depict the cross-linkable faces of aTMH4 with cTMH2. TMHs 4 and 5 are predicted to swivel counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively, during the gating of proton access to cAsp-61 from the periplasmic half-channel in the center of the four-helix bundle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the experiments reported here, we probed the reactivity of the most Ag+-sensitive Cys residues in subunit a with Cd2+ and methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents of varying polarity (see Fig. 1 for location). MTS reagent reactivity was confined to 3 Cys residues in TMH4 that are thought to line the aqueous access pathway to the cytoplasm, i.e. N214C, S206C, and S202C. The Cd2+ reactivity of inverted membrane vesicles was confined to Cys localized to the cytoplasmic side of subunit a. Cd2+-insensitive but Ag+-sensitive residues were found to cluster at the center of the proposed four-helix bundle extending to the periplasm (Fig. 2). However, on sonication of the inverted membrane vesicles, these residues became Cd2+-sensitive, which supports the proposed aqueous accessibility to this region of the protein from the periplasmic face of the membrane. The residues made accessible by sonication include N214C and Q252C, which pack at the interfaces of TMH4 and TMH5 and the surface of the c-ring. Swiveling of helices at this interface was proposed to gate H+ access to cAsp-61 during H+-transport-driven ATP synthesis (27Moore K.J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31726-31735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We suggest that these two Cd2+-sensitive residues may define the gate of H+ access from the periplasmic half-channel to cAsp-61 and then to the second half-channel to the cytoplasm.DISCUSSIONOnly three of twelve of the most Ag+-sensitive Cys substitutions in subunit a proved to be sensitive to any of the MTS reagents tested, as assessed by inhibition of ATP-driven ACMA quenching activity. Inhibition was only observed with the smallest of the reagents tested, i.e. MTSM and MTSEA, and then with only the S202C, S206C, and N214C substitutions. The size or possibly the charge of the groups on MTSET, MTSCE, and MTSES may prevent access to any of the twelve Cys substitutions tested in Table 1. It is unclear whether MTSM and MTSET have access to the nine substitutions that are insensitive to inhibition by these reagents. Five of these substitutions, i.e. D119C, L120C, M215C, I249C, and Q252C, are not accessible to labeling with [14C]NEM (22Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Angevine C.M. Herold K.A. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13179-13183Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), so there may be a correlation between NEM and MTS-reagent accessibility. On the other hand, the S199C, S202C, and S203C are all labeled by [14C]NEM, although NEM is not inhibitory (23Angevine C.M. Herold K.A. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13179-13183Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Moore K.J. Angevine C.M. Vincent O.D. Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13044-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 4The reaction of [14C]NEM with many of the residues listed in Table 1 has been reported previously and normalized to the most NEM-reactive residue S206C (22, 23). The reactivity of additional Cys substitutions with [14C]NEM is reported in Angevine, C.A., Ph.D Thesis, University of Wisconsin, Madison, 2004. These residues include: V198C (10%), S199C (100%), L200C (29%), L201C (14%), S202C (61%), K203C (72%), P204C (5%), and V205C (9%), where the relative reactivity is normalized to that of S206C at 100%. It is thus possible that some of the Cys substitutions studied here are modified by the MTS reagents and that the modification is not inhibitory.For S202C, S206C, and N214C, the greater sensitivity to inhibition by MTSEA versus MTSM can probably be attributed to the disruptive effects caused by a positively charged amine introduced into these transmembrane positions. For S202C this conclusion is supported by the mutagenesis studies where the S202K substitution was much more disruptive than the S202M or S202I substitutions. In the case of S206C, the disruption of function by MTSM and NEM can be attributed at least partially in introduction of a bulky group at this position. This conclusion is supported by mutagenesis studies where the S206A substitution is non-disruptive (34Howitt S.M. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas the S206L substitution nearly abolishes function (35Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10043-10050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The size of the group introduced at N214C also appears to be a critical factor in inhibition of function in that the N214L substitution is much more debilitating than the N214V substitution (36Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The three residues showing MTS reagent sensitivity, i.e. S202C, S206C, and N214C, are thought to pack at the interface of aTMH4 and the peripheral surface of cTMH2 of the c-ring. The rate of reaction of MTS reagents with ionized thiolates is > 5 × 109 times that of reaction with a neutral thiol (37Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), so it is very likely that the reactive Cys residues report an aqueous accessible space in this transmembrane region of the protein. S206C and N214C are the only two substitutions in subunit a that are sensitive to major inhibition by NEM and, in models derived from cross-linking evidence and the c-ring x-ray structures, would pack around the MTSEA-sensitive pocket in subunit c that surrounds Asp-61 (38Steed P.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12365-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The only Cys substitution in subunit c that is inhibited by NEM is cG58C, and it also packs in this pocket (38Steed P.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12365-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The activity of all Ag+-sensitive Cys substitutions mapping toward the cytoplasmic side of aTMH4 and aTMH5 was inhibited by treatment with CdCl2 (Fig. 1). Cd2+-sensitive residues 199, 202, 203, and 263 are likely to cluster at the cytoplasmic surface of TMHs 4 and 5 where they could interact with the Cd2+-sensitive cQ52C substitution in subunit c (39Steed P.R. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23243-23250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast to these residues, the activity of Cys substitutions at positions 119, 120, 214, 215, and 252 was not inhibited by Cd2+. Each of these substitutions localize more toward the center or periplasmic side of the membrane. For each of these substitutions, sonication of inside-out membrane vesicles during Cd2+ treatment to expose the periplasmic surface resulted in strong inhibition of ATP-driven ACMA quenching activity. We conclude that Cd2+ cannot permeate the E. coli inner membrane and that the permeability barrier to Cd2+ explains the lack of inhibition seen with the 119, 120, 214, 215, and 252 substitutions in the absence of sonication. Residues 206 and 214 would pack directly above and below the essential Arg-210 residue in an α-helical model of TMH4 (Fig. 1). Based upon these results we predict that Ser-206 provides aqueous access to the half-channel extending to the cytoplasm and that Asn-214 is accessed from the periplasmic half-channel at the interior of the four-helix bundle formed by TMHs 2–4 (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2).The accessibility of residues 214 and 252 from the periplasm, and their positioning in the protein at the interface of the c-ring (Fig. 2), is consistent with a previous proposal that these residues may be involved in gating H+ access from the periplasmic half-channel to cAsp-61 during the protonation step (27Moore K.J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31726-31735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based upon previous cross-linking experiments, gating was proposed to occur via helical swiveling of both aTMH4 and aTMH5, with simultaneous movement of Asn-214 and Gln-252 toward the c-ring interface, and with the coordinated movement of Arg-210 away from a deprotonated c-subunit to facilitate its reprotonation from periplasmic half-channel. The effects of sonication reported here on Cd2+ inhibition support the idea of aqueous access from the periplasm to not only residues Asn-214 and Gln-252, but also to Asp-119, Leu-120, Met-215, and His-245 in the predicted center of the four-helix bundle. Based upon their predicted depth of packing in the membrane, we would predict that the transported proton would initially encounter the D119/L120/M215/H245 region of the protein before moving to the predicted Asn-214 and Gln-252 gating residues. We are attracted to the idea that His-245 may initially buffer proton accumulation in this region (33Mulkidjanian A.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and a role for a histidine at this position as a buffering residue is supported by the D119H second site suppressor to the inactivating H245C mutation (15Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The possible role of His-245 in capturing protons at near neutral pH is also supported by its replacement with a Lys in alkalophilic bacteria at a position equivalent to Gly-218 in E. coli (40Hicks D.B. Liu J. Fujisawa M. Krulwich T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1362-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the necessity of this alkalophilic-specific Lys for function at alkaline pH (41Wang Z. Hicks D.B. Guffanti A.A. Baldwin K.

The nearness of positions 218 and 245 in subunit a of E. coli is supported not only by cross-linking studies (26Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) but also by second site suppressor substitutions in Gly-218 to the H245G mutation (43Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32313-32317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IntroductionThe H+-transporting F1Fo ATP synthases of oxidative phosphorylation utilize the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient of H+ or Na+ to mechanically drive the synthesis of ATP via two coupled rotary motors in the F1 and Fo sectors of the enzyme (1Yoshida M. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 2Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Trends Biochem.

In the intact enzyme, H+ transport through the transmembrane Fo sector is coupled to ATP synthesis or hydrolysis in the F1 sector at the surface of the membrane. Homologous enzymes are found in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and many bacteria (5Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli and other eubacteria, F1 consists of five subunits in an α3β3γ1δ1ϵ1 stoichiometry (5Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Fo is composed of three subunits in a likely ratio of a1b2c10 in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis PS3 (6Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The high resolution x-ray structure of the I. tartaricus c11-ring revealed the sodium binding site at the periphery of the ring with chelating groups to the Na+ extending from two interacting subunits in an extensive hydrogen bonding network (8Meier T.

Subsequently published structures of H+ binding c-rings from chloroplasts (12Krah A. Pogoryelov D. Meier T. Faraldo-Gómez J.D. J. Mol.

Biol. 2010; 8: e1000443Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have revealed at least two modes of liganding the proton at the essential side chain carboxyl using alternative hydrogen-bonding networks (13Preiss L. Yildiz O. Hicks D.B. Krulwich T.A. Meier T. Plos. Biol. 2010; 8: e1000443Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In the H+-transporting E. coli enzyme, Asp-61 at the center of the second TMH is thought to undergo protonation and deprotonation as each subunit of the c-ring moves past a stationary subunit a (1Yoshida M.

In the complete membranous enzyme, the rotation of the c-ring is proposed to be driven by H+ transport at the subunit a/c interface, with ring movement then driving rotation of subunit γ within the α3β3 hexamer of F1 to cause conformational changes in the catalytic sites leading to synthesis and release of ATP (1Yoshida M.

Transepithelial Cl− secretion, the driving force for fluid secretion, is dependent on O2 availability for generation of cellular energy. Here, we investigated the role of hydroxylases in regulating epithelial secretion and the potential for targeting these enzymes in treatment of diarrheal disorders. Ion transport was measured as short-circuit current changes across voltage-clamped monolayers of T84 cells and mouse colon. The antidiarrheal efficacy of dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG) was tested in a mouse model of allergic disease. Hydroxylase inhibition with DMOG attenuated Ca2+- and cAMP-dependent secretory responses in voltage-clamped T84 cells to 20.2 ± 2.6 and 38.8 ± 6.7% (n= 16; P<0.001) of those in control cells, respectively. Antisecretory actions of DMOG were time and concentration dependent, being maximal after 18 h of DMOG (1 mM) treatment. DMOG specifically inhibited Na+/K+-ATPase pump activity without altering its expression or membrane localization. In mice, DMOG inhibited agonist-induced secretory responses ex vivo and prevented allergic diarrhea in vivo. In conclusion, hydroxylases are important regulators of epithelial Cl− and fluid secretion and present a promising target for development of new drugs to treat transport disorders.—Ward, J. B.
