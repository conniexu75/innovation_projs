https://openalex.org/W1967139082,"Quantitative neurohistological techniques were used to examine the hippocampal complex of laboratory rats maintained on ethanol-containing or control diets for 5 months followed by a 2-month alcohol-free period. Chronic ethanol consumption resulted in a significant loss of hippocampal pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cells. This study provides direct evidence that long-term ethanol consumption, in the absence of malnutrition, produces neuronal loss in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2135378706,"Ethanol (ethyl alcohol) potentiates the inhibition of cortical neurons by gamma-aminobutyric acid. This effect is specific, since ethanol does not potentiate inhibiton by glycine, serotonin, or dopamine. These results have implications for alcoholism because (i) gamma-aminobutyric acid mediates anxiolytic mechanisms, and (ii) anxiety is implicated in the etiology of alcoholism."

A perfectly coherent sphere yielded a stable perceptual organization that was detected more accurately than other slightly less organized patterns."

https://openalex.org/W1525920598,"Proteoglycans were extracted from bovine lung gas exchange tissue, pleura, and bronchioles with 4.0 M guanidinium chloride at 5 degrees C in the presence of protease inhibitors. Preliminary purification of the proteoglycans was achieved by an initial CsCl isopycnic centrifugation (rho 0 = 1.33) and through precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride in 0.5 M KCl. Further purification and fractionation of proteoglycans was achieved by a second CsCl isopycnic centrifugation (rho 0 = 1.45) in 4.0 M guanidinium chloride. Based on the ultracentrifuge profiles and electrophoretic behavior, the major fractions were pooled. They were purified further by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-2B and characterized by extensive analyses. A heparan sulfate proteoglycan was the major proteoglycan identified in the gas exchange tissue and in the pleura. The major proteoglycan component from the bronchioles was a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Approximate molecular weight of 2 x 10(6) for the heparan sulfate proteoglycan from the pleura and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan from the bronchioles and 1 x 10(6) for the heparan sulfate proteoglycan from the gas exchange tissue were estimated from gel filtration analyses. After incubation with hyaluronic acid, the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans from the bronchioles showed an increase in specific viscosity and a higher molecular weight compound eluting near the void volume in Sepharose CL-2B column chromatography. The proteoglycans exhibited varied anticoagulant activities in Stypven, partial thromboplastin and thrombin clotting times and inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2016293198,"Calcium ion-selective microelectrodes made with Simon's neutral carrier were used to measure simultaneously sarcoplasmic Ca2+ activity (aiCa) and resting tension (Tr) of rabbit ventricular muscle during reduction and restoration of external sodium ion concentration, [Na]0. Under the same experimental conditions the change in contractile tension (Ta) also measured. In resting muscle the aiCa was 38 +/- 17 nanomolar (mean +/- standard deviation; N = 10). The reduction of [Na]O from 153 to 20 millimolar led to about a threefold increase in aiCa with parallel increases in Tr and Ta. The time course of the change in aiCa was similar to that of the changes in Tr and Ta. The results are consistent with an important role of the sodium-calcium exchange system for regulating sarcoplasmic Ca2+ activity."

Data indicate that mental processes in a double-stimulation experiment by Becker are executed in a critical-path network. A relationship predicted for the timing of the responses of the task is shown to hold.

https://openalex.org/W1502870055,"Glucocorticoids induce ovalbumin and conalbumin mRNA in oviducts from chicks withdrawn from prior estrogen treatment. The magnitude and the kinetics of the responses obtained, either in vivo or in vitro, are comparable to those obtained with estrogen or progesterone. With cultured oviducts, 1 nM dexamethasone is sufficient for half-maximal accumulation of nuclear receptors and partial induction of both mRNAs, while maximal levels of receptors and both mRNAs are achieved with 30 to 100 nM dexamethasone. Competition experiments show that dexamethasone acts by binding to a class of high affinity receptors distinct from the sex steroid receptors. Dexamethasone acts synergistically with estrogen, but not with progesterone."

https://openalex.org/W145821160,"Arylhydroxamic acid N,O-acyltransferase and Co-ASAc-dependent N-acetyltransferase activities were measured simultaneously in liver cytosols from rabbits of known acetylator phenotype. Both activities were high in rapid acetylator rabbits and low in slow acetylator rabbits indicating that these two acetyl transfer steps in the metabolic activation of certain arylamines are under common genetic control in this species. The two enzyme activities could not be resolved by sequential centrifugation, fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate, ion exchange chromatograhy on DEAE-cellulose, gel filtration on Sephacryl, and electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis of extracts of disc gel electrophoretic slices showed that a single symmetrical protein band with a molecular weight of 33,000 was associated with both activities. The results obtained strongly suggest that the CoASAc-dependent N-acetyltransferase reaction and the intramolecular N,O-acetyl transfer by arylhydroxamic acid N,O-acyltransferase are properties of the same enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1555350323,"The interaction of snake venom phospholipases A2 with phospholipids has been studied by intrinsic fluorescence. This has been performed in order to understand why some enzymes possess anticoagulant properties while others have no action on blood clotting. We show that phospholipases A2 can be distinguished according to their binding properties to phospholipid vesicles. Strong inhibitors of coagulation interact with phospholipids with a significant change of their fluorescence while poor inhibitors have little or no effect. Strong inhibitors have a great affinity toward phosphatidylserine and do not require Ca2+ for interaction. Similar results are obtained with phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidylserine 1:1 mixtures. The diether analogue of phosphatidylcholine shows that formation of the complex is promoted by Ca2+ and can occur whenever the lipids are in crystal or fluid phase. Inactivation of anticoagulant phospholipase A2 decreased the affinity of enzyme for the phospholipids. The change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the phospholipases A2 on binding indicates a modification of the environment of the tryptophan residues. This is discussed in terms of the so-called interface recognition site as seen in the case of pancreatic phospholipase A2. It is concluded that the phospholipases may inhibit coagulation by competing with clotting proteins for the lipid surface. Although not considered in this study, the consequence of the hydrolysis of lipids remains to be estimated."

https://openalex.org/W63828164,"Choleragen (cholera toxin) catalyzed the NAD-dependent auto-ADP-ribosyltation of its A1 peptide. The number of ADP-ribose moieties incorporated into ech A1 peptide was dependent on incubation conditions and time as well as toxin concentration. There was no evidence for the formation of poly(ADP-ribosylated) toxin. The formation of mono- and multi-(ADP-ribosylated) A1 peptides was prevented by the addition of arginine, an alternative ADP-ribose acceptor. Triton X-100 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separated the A1 peptide of choleragen from the B complex and multi-(ADP-ribosylated) A1 peptides from unmodified A1. The A1 peptides ADP-ribosylated in the presence of [32P]NAD contained approximately 1, 2, or 3 ADP-ribose molecules/23,500-dalton units; under the conditions used for electrophoresis, the mobilities of the A1 peptides were enhanced by incorporation of ADP-ribose. The mono- and multi-(ADP-ribosylated) A1 peptides catalyzed the NAD-dependent ADP-ribosylation of arginine methyl ester. The turnover numbers of the mono- and multi-(ADP-ribosylated) A1 peptides were consistently 30 to 50% higher than that of the A1 peptide from native toxin."

This result indicates that the neural pathways which process visual self-rotation cues can undergo rapid adaptive modification."

https://openalex.org/W1535633602,"Tetraphenylarsonium (TPA+) inhibited energy transduction in oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria but not in submitochondrial particles, which are inside-out relative to the membranes of mitochondria. TPA+ incorporated into the inside of submitochondrial particles inhibited ATP synthesis in the particles. TPA+ also inhibited the reduction of NAD by succinate coupled with oxidation of succinate by O2 and hydrolysis of ATP. Energization of mitochondrial inner membranes with succinate and with ATP induced binding sites on the membranes for TPA+. The amounts of energy-dependent binding sites for TPA+ on mitochondria energized with succinate and with ATP, respectively, were 90 and 13 nmol/mg of protein. TPA+ also caused shrinkage of mitochondria energized with succinate and with ATP in an energy-dependent fashion. The energy-dependent binding of TPA+, TPA+-induced H+-ejection, TPA+-induced shrinkage of mitochondria, and TPA+-induced inhibition of energy transduction occurred in parallel. The present findings show that TPA+ inhibits energy transduction by binding to negative charges created on lipophilic domains near the surface of the outer side (C-side) of the mitochondrial inner membranes, and that it has no inhibitory activity on the inner side (M-side) of the membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1483394263,"The binding of rat liver ribosomal proteins L6, L7, and L19 to 5 S rRNA was characterized by nitrocellulose membrane filtration. Binding could be saturated with the three proteins; the apparent association constants (Ka'), measured at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C, ranged from 1.3 to 6.8 x 10(5) M-1. The molar ratio of ribosomal protein and rRNA in the complex at saturation approximated 1, indicating there is one binding site for each of the three proteins on the nucleic acid. A large number of rat liver ribosomal proteins, including some previously suspected of associating weakly, did not form a complex with 5 S rRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1593784831,"Highly purified HLA (A and B) antigens in octylglucoside were quantitatively incorporated into egg lecithin vesicles, and it was demonstrated that vesicles of different densities could be prepared by varying the ratio of lipid to protein. The HLA antigens were bound to the vesicles by the hydrophobic stretch of amino acids normally integrated into the plasma membrane, and most if not all HLA antigens in the lipid vesicles occurred in the right-side-out orientation, as demonstrated by pronase digestion and by quantitative radioimmunoassay determinations on intact HLA antigen-containing vesicles. Both the lipid and the HLA antigens aggregated at octylglucoside concentrations below the critical micelle concentration. The protein aggregates appeared stable and could be incorporated into preformed lipid vesicles. It is suggested that vesicle formation preceeds the incorporation of protein into the lipid vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1599897458,"Incubation of hen oviduct membranes with UDP-[14C]N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) leads to the formation of four endogenously labeled lipids. One of these lipids has not previously been characterized. Based on its chromatographic behavior on SG-81 paper and DEAE-cellulose, it is a monophosphate diester. The oviduct lipid is extremely sensitive to mild acid hydrolysis and, based on a comparison with alpha-GlcNAc-phosphoryl-undecaprenol from Bacillus cereus, the oviduct lipid contains GlcNAc linked to a polyisoprene as the beta anomer, the polyisoprene containing an alpha-unsaturated isoprene unit. Molecular sieve chromatography indicates that the molecular weight of the lipid is on the order of mannosyl-phosphoryl-dolichol and larger than alpha-GlcNAc-phosphoryl-undecaprenol. Formation of the GlcNAc-lipid is insensitive to tunicamycin. Dolichyl phosphate stimulates formation of a GlcNAc-lipid with similar chromatographic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1508936235,"Xenopus laevis oocyte nuclei were manually isolated and incubated in vitro to synthesize RNA. Aliquots were removed before and during the reaction and prepared for electron microscopy, in order to observe the amplified ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Before in vitro incubation the rRNA transcription units are covered with close-packed RNA polymerase molecules and attached rRNP fibers, which are interpreted to have initiated in vivo. With incubation, these close-packed transcription complexes move down the gene at a rate of 2.2 nucleotides per s. Behind this close-packed region we see RNA polymerase x nascent chain complexes at about one-fifth the in vivo frequency. These are interpreted to be in vitro initiation events. After 45 min of incubation, when most of the in vivo-initiated transcripts have terminated transcription, the in vitro-initiated transcripts define the same length transcription unit seen prior to incubation. These observations are consistent with correct in vitro initiation and termination by RNA polymerases on the endogenous amplified ribosomal DNA of Xenopus laevis."
https://openalex.org/W84758718,"Chromaffin granules in isotonic solutions of K+ CH3COO- (acetate), K+ CH3CHOHCOO- (lactate), and K+2-OOCCH2CH2COO- (succinate) are stable at pH 7 but release 40 to 80% of their soluble contents of catecholamines, ATP, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase when the medium pH is less than 6. Enkephalin-like material which has recently been shown to co-sediment with chromaffin granules in sucrose density gradients is also released at low pH. The release of ATP and enkephalin-like material is proportional to the release of catecholamine. The release of soluble constituents of chromaffin granules is inhibited by increasing the osmolality of the solution with sucrose. Granules in isotonic solutions of salts of strong acids such as K+CH3SO4- (methylsulfate), K+ CH2OHCH2SO3- (isethionate), and K2SO4 are stable between pH7.0 and 5.4. The granules behave as predicted for organelles with an acid interior and the data provide further evidence that the intragranular pH is acidic. In addition, the results strongly suggest that enkephalin-like material is stored together with catecholamine and ATP in an acid compartment."

https://openalex.org/W1524338766,"Hexokinase PI x glucose crystals grown with radiolabeled glucose under conditions similar to those used for x-ray diffraction studies (Bennett, W.S., Jr., and Steitz, T.A. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 4848-4852) have been shown to contain 1 mol of tightly bound glucose. These crystals exchange all of this glucose in a single exponential process (kobs = 0.7 min-1). In the crystalline form they are, however, inactive and do not catalyze formation of any bound glucose-6-P, suggesting that lattice forces prevent catalysis. A new catalytically active E x glucose complex has been crystallized in the presence of glucose and ADP, a competitive inhibitor of ATP. These crystals readily lose ADP upon washing with concentrated (NH4)2SO4. They exchange all of the tightly bound glucose more slowly than the form grown in the absence of ADP (kobs = 0.05 min-1). Addition of MgATP to the suspension in ammonium sulfate results in rapid conversion of half of the bound glucose to bound glucose 6-phosphate followed by further reaction as products are released. This agrees with the previously measured equilibrium constant of unity for enzyme-bound phosphoryl transfer catalyzed in solution (Wilkinson, K.D., and Rose, I.A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12567-12572). These results indicate that the two E x glucose crystals are distinguished by a nucleotide-dependent conformational difference, which is stabilized by lattice forces. The active crystals allow the facile dissociation of the ADP used to induce the change. This conformational change appears to be pevented in the E x glucose crystals and to be necessary to produce the active ternary complex."
https://openalex.org/W1550163466,"Heats of CO and IHP binding to hemoglobin A have been determined under a variety of buffer and pH conditions. From these data heats of ion binding linked to hemoglobin oxygenation have been estimated. For IHP binding to deoxyhemoglobin the buffer-corrected enthalpies are surprisingly large, reaching -25 kcal/mol of IHP at pH 7.4. These values correspond to approximately -11 kcal/mol of proton absorbed upon IHP binding and may rise largely from the protonation of hitidine and NH2-terminal groups in the binding site (Arnone, A., and Perutz, M.F. (1974) Nature 249, 34-36). The decreased magnitude of delta HIHP observed at low pH parallels the decreased proton uptake at low pH. In 0.1 M chloride (pH 7.4) the reaction Hb(aq) + IHP leads to Hb x IHP(aq) has a standard free energy change (Edalji, R., Benesch, R.E., and Benesch, R. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 7720-7721) of -10 kcal and an enthalpy change of -25 kcal. Therefore, enthalpic forces provide the dominant driving force of this process. The origin of these large negative enthalpy changes is attributed to the exothermic protonation of protein basic groups induced by the proximity of phosphate negative charges. The importance of protonation in the binding of organic phosphates to hemoglobin may well extend to the specific binding of other phosphate substrates to enzyme reaction sites."
https://openalex.org/W1533057272,"Extensive replication of duplex T7 DNA is catalyzed in reactions contining T7 DNA polymerase, T7 gene 4 protein, and T7 RNA polymerase. When the product of this reaction is analyzed in the electron microscope, many eye form and Y form replication intermediates are observed. Replication in vitro is not initiated at a single region of the T7 genome. However, we tentatively conclude that initiation does occur preferentially at a few specific sites along the DNA, and that these sites may be near promoters at which the T7 RNA polymerase initiates transcription."

https://openalex.org/W291702313,"To study the physiological role of keto-enol tautomerization at the 2-keto acid stage in branched chain amino acid metabolism, we administered valine and isobutyric acid, both chirally labeled with stable isotopes, to vitamin Blz-folate-deficient rats. The intramolecular isotope enrichment in the urinary methylmalonic acid from these rats was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and selected ion monitoring. Urinary methylmalonic acid from two rats loaded with (2RS,3S)-[4-13C]valine was labeled predominantly at one of the carboxyl carbon atoms. The 2-methyl group was not labeled to a significant degree. This indicates that in valine metabolism, isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenation occurred stereospecifically by abstracting one hydrogen each from the (2proS)methyl and the a-methine groups of isobutyrate, confirming our previous results (Amster, J., and Tanaka, K. (1980) J. Biol. Chem 255, 119-120), and that keto-enol tautomerization did not occur to a significant degree under these conditions. Urinary methylmalonic acid excreted by a rat loaded with (2S,3S)-[4,4,4-’H3]valine was labeled 19 atom % with three ’H at the 2-methyl group. However, this ‘H3 enrichment in the 2-methyl group is greatly exaggerated by a selective retention of the 2-[’H3]methylmalonic acid due to the deuterium isotope effect on the residual methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. This was indicated by results on another rat loaded with (2S)-[3,3,3‘H3]isobutyric acid. It excreted a large amount of 3hydroxyisobutyric acid in addition to methylmalonic acid. Urinary methylmalonic acid from this rat was labeled 29 atom % with three ‘H at the 2-methyl group while only 5 atom 8 of urinary 3-hydroxyisobutyrate was labeled with three ‘H at the 2-methyl group. The remaining 95% of urinary 3-hydroxyisobutyrate was labeled with two ’H at the hydroxymethyl group."

Addition of the allosteric regulator ADP to the reaction mixture protects the enzyme from loss of activity. A second adenosine analogue has been synthesized, adenosine 5'-(n-propyl)-phosphate, which is used to assess any effects that might arise from the noncovalent interaction of adenosine 5'-(2-bromoethyl)-phosphate with the enzyme.
