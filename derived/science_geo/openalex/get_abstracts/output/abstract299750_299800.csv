https://openalex.org/W2111049119,"The roughly 25 percent increase in luminosity over the life of the sun shared by many different solar models is shown to be a very general result, independent of the uncertainties suggested by the solar neutrino experiment. Superficially, this leads to a conflict with the climatic history of the earth, and if basic concepts of stellar evolution are not fundamentally in error, compensating effects must have occurred, as first pointed out by Sagan and Mullen. One possible interpretation supported by recent detailed models of the earth's atmosphere is that the greenhouse effect was substantially more important than at present even as recently as 1 billion to 2 billion years ago."
https://openalex.org/W1972273790,"Analyses of suspended particulate matter larger than 1 micrometer, filtered from thousands of liters of surface and deep waters during GEOSECS expeditions to the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, have provided new information on the nature and time scales of chemical processes associated with the particles. Trace element and radionuclide data show that particles scavenge trace elements such as Th, Pu, Fe, Pb, and Cu from the ocean column, thereby controlling their concentrations. For other elements, however, particles are a source: carbon and silicon, for example, are introduced at depths as sinking particles dissolve. Studies of both particulate concentrations by filtration of seawater and particulate fluxes by using sediment traps seem necessary to delineate the intricate nature of chemical processes in the oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2041015811,"In the production of high quality protein, feed grains will continue to be used to finish cattle for market as long as economics dictates. Production systems could be developed that would make ruminant animals less competitive with humans for feed grains, but the costs of instituting such programs would be prohibitive. Sufficient genetic variation exists either between or within breeds for the cattle population to be adapted to new management programs and for current methods of beef production to be significantly improved."

https://openalex.org/W2066149136,"Conditions look good for the in-situ conversion and surface retorting of oil shales. The difficulty of fracturing the shale is alleviated by using the modified in situ process, in which about 20% of the shale is first mined out. Surface retorting is also under development. The problem of high N, S, and paraffinic waxes in the shale oil may be solvable by hydrogen treatment. Environmental impacts appear manageable; restrictive air quality standards are being eased. Ammonia and elemental sulfur could be recovered as by-products. A mix of surface, in situ, and modified in situ retorting might be able to produce 2 to 3 million bpd by 2000. (DLC)"
