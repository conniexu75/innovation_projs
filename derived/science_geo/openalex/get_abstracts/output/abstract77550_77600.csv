https://openalex.org/W1481302063,"Glomeruli were prepared from bovine renal cortex with the use of sieves of varying mesh, both for the disruption of the tissue and for the separation of the glomeruli from other tissue components. Basement membranes, obtained by the ultrasonic treatment of these glomeruli, were shown to be free of cellular contaminants. Compositional studies performed on the glomerular basement membrane indicated that this structure is a glycoprotein with a carbohydrate content of approximately 9%. The sugar components present were identified as glucose, galactose, mannose, hexosamines, sialic acids, and fucose. The hexosamines consisted of both glucosamine and galactosamine in a ratio of 8.7:1.3, while the sialic acids occurred as N-glycolylneuraminic acid and N-acetylneuraminic acid in the ratio of 5.9:4.1. Essentially all of the sialic acid could be released by the action of neuraminidase or by mild acid hydrolysis. The peptide portion of the basement membrane was characterized by the presence of large amounts of glycine (one-fifth of the amino acid residues), as well as by the occurrence of substantial amounts of hydroxyproline (6.5% of the membrane weight) and hydroxylysine (2.8%). In addition, all of the commonly occurring amino acids were present, including half-cystine (2.7%), methionine (1.6%), and tryptophan (0.93%). Amide analyses indicated that 41% of the dicarboxylic amino acids were in the amide form. An accounting of the charged amino acid and sugar residues indicated that per 1000 amino acid residues there was a net positive charge of 14. Of interest among the properties of this membrane was its complete solubility under conditions of mild alkaline treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1528809082,"The following scheme is proposed to represent the path of tritium in the aconitase (aconitate hydratase) reaction. [see PDF for equation] Five experiments that support this scheme are presented. 1. The conversion of 3-T-isocitrate to citrate at early times gives T-citrate with no loss of tritium. 2. When the conversion of 2-T-citrate to isocitrate is brought to completion by trapping the isocitrate with isocitrate dehydrogenase, and the α-ketoglutarate formed with glutamate dehydrogenase, the amount of tritium found in the glutamate agrees with the prediction based on the relative initial rates of formation of isocitrate and cis-aconitate from citrate. 3. The transfer of deuterium from citrate to isocitrate in the absence of high concentrations of cis-aconitate is shown to be largely intramolecular. 4. At high concentrations of cis-aconitate some of the tritium of 2-T-citrate that is normally found in the water is diverted to isocitrate. 5. This conservation of tritium is due to an intermolecular transfer since in the presence of high cis-aconitate the tritiated 2-methyl hydroxy acids give rise to tritiated isocitrate. These data support a mechanism of base-catalyzed proton abstraction from hydroxy acid substrate. The conjugate acid group so formed on the enzyme is slow to dissociate and either is transferred to bound cis-aconitate before the latter dissociates, or, if the cis-aconitate is released, the conjugate acid group dissociates to regenerate the enzyme base. In the interconversion of the hydroxy acids there is little or no transfer of 18O-labeled hydroxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1490801680,"Abstract Adenosine kinase, purified 175-fold from human tumor cells in culture, was free of adenosine deaminase and adenosine monophosphate kinase activities. A nucleoside triphosphate was required for the phosphorylation of adenosine or of 6-methylthiopurine ribonucleoside. Either adenosine triphosphate, inosine triphosphate, or guanosine triphosphate satisfied this requirement, and dATP substituted to a smaller extent. The phosphorylation of adenosine required no added divalent cation, but Mg++ or Mn++ greatly stimulated the phosphorylation of 6-methylthiopurine ribonucleoside; Ca++ or Co++ were less effective in this regard. The pH optima were 6.2 to 6.8 for adenosine as substrate and 6.8 for 6-methylthiopurine ribonucleoside; the Km for adenosme was 1.8 x 10-6 m, and that for 6-methylthiopurine ribonucleoside was 5.0 x 10-5 m. The enzyme did not catalyze phosphorylation of inosine or guanosine; but under the conditions used, it phosphorylated several derivatives and analogues of adenosine to a greater extent than adenosine itself. The well phosphorylated compounds included analogues of adenosine in which (a) -H, -Cl, -SCH3, -OCH3, -NHCH3, -N(CH3)2, or -CH3 replaced the amino group; (b) pyrazole, pyrrole, or triazole rings replaced the imidazole ring; (c) -CH3 or =O substituted for -H in position 1; and (d) -F substituted for-H in position 2. Replacement of the ribofuranosyl group by arabinofuranosyl, xylofuranosyl, or deoxyribosyl groups resulted in compounds that were either poorly or not at all phosphorylated. 6-Mercaptopurine ribonucleoside, 6,6'-dithiobis(9-β-d-ribofuranosylpurine), and 2-fluoro-6-mercaptopurine ribonucleoside, compounds which were not themselves phosphorylated, inhibited the phosphorylation of both adenosine and 6-methylthiopurine ribonucleoside."

These proteins are freely soluble in buffer solutions, are heterogeneous, contain deoxyribonucleic and ribonucleic acids, and are separable into four main fractions. The isolated chromatin acidic proteins form complexes with whole histone as well as with DNA. When they are incubated in vitro with 14C-tryptophan, the isotopic label is incorporated into the protein, especially in the presence of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1850492588,"Pyruvate carboxylase purified from chicken liver shows an essentially absolute requirement for activation by an acyl coenzyme A in all preparations and under all conditions tested thus far. The enzyme is activated by formyl-, acetyl-, propionyl-, crotonyl-, and iso-butyryl-CoA, but carboxylated analogues of the activating acyl derivatives of CoA and certain other acetyl thioesters are potent competitive inhibitors with respect to acetyl-CoA. Examination of the initial reaction rate as a function of activator concentration reveals a sigmoid relationship, suggesting that more than 1 molecule of activator per active site is required for the activation process or that cooperative interactions between the bound activator molecules occur. Inactivation analyses show an interaction of acetyl-CoA with pyruvate carboxylase, with resultant marked alterations in the tertiary and quaternary structures of the protein as compared with the free enzyme. For example, the rate of inactivation of this biotin enzyme by avidin is markedly increased in the presence of acetyl-CoA concentrations similar to those required for activation of the over-all reaction. Acetyl-CoA also affords almost complete protection of this enzyme against denaturation at 2° or by low concentrations of urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate. These findings are consistent with the proposal that acetyl-CoA and the other activator acyl-CoA derivatives act as allosteric effectors for pyruvate carboxylase. However, acetyl-CoA in the presence or absence of other reaction components has no significant effect either on the sedimentation properties of pyruvate carboxylase in the range from 0.5 to 5.0 mg of protein per ml or on the absorption spectrum of this enzyme. Pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes a very slow hydrolysis of acyl thioesters. An apparent relationship between thioester hydrolysis and the activation of the over-all reaction is suggested by studies of the specificity of hydrolysis and of the effects of other reaction components on the rate of hydrolysis. The evidence appears to exclude the possibility that the activated species of pyruvate carboxylase is an acyl-enzyme, and the observed thioester hydrolysis may therefore be related indirectly to the activation process."
https://openalex.org/W89953681,"Recently developed weapon systems were compared with systems of similar function in use 10 to 20 years earlier. The most significant finding was that the improvement in performance or reduction in cost is largely the synergistic effect of a large number of scientific and technological innovations, of which only about 10 percent had been made at the time the earlier system was designed. The common scientific and technological base of the systems was not analyzed. Of the innovations, or Events, 9 percent were classified as science and 91 percent as technology. Ninety-five percent of all Events were funded by the defense sector. Nearly 95 percent were motivated by a recognized defense need. Only 0.3 percent came from undirected science. The results of the study do not call in question the value of undirected science on the 50-year-or-more time scale. In light of our finding that 5 to 10 years are often required before even a piece of highly applied research is ""fitted in"" as an effective contributing member of a large assembly of other Events, it is not surprising that ""fragments"" of undirected science are infrequently utilized on even a 20-year time scale. The most obvious way in which undirected science appears to enter into technology and utilization on a substantial scale seems to be in the compressed, highly organized form of a well-established, clearly expressed general theory, or in the evaluated, ordered knowledge of handbooks, textbooks, and university courses."
https://openalex.org/W1597439947,"Abstract The substrate inhibition of palmityl coenzyme A:carnitine O-palmityltransferase (EC 2.3.1.-) by palmityl-CoA has been studied. Beside being a substrate for the enzyme, palmityl-CoA was found to behave as a competitive inhibitor for the second substrate (carnitine). The Ki was found to be approximately 3 x 10-6 m, while the Km for palmityl-CoA was found to be approximately 10-5 m. Thus, the affinity of palmityl-CoA as an inhibitor for the enzyme was at least as high as its affinity as substrate. These results explain the pronounced substrate inhibition by palmityl-CoA. The Km values for the other substrates were found to be: l-carnitine, 2.5 x 10-4 m; l-palmitylcarnitine, 4 x 10-5 m; and CoA, 5 x 10-5 m. The possible physiological importance of the reaction kinetics of carnitine palmityltransferase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589733184,"Abstract The allosteric properties of crystalline adenosine 5'-phosphate deaminase prepared from rabbit muscle were investigated. The enzyme was demonstrated to have homotropic effects with its substrate, AMP. The apparent Km is 0.9 mm and the Hill slope (n) is 2.2. In the presence of potassium, linear Michaelis-Menten kinetics was obtained, giving a Km for AMP of 0.4 mm and a Hill slope of 1.1. The Vmax is the same in the presence or absence of KCl. In the absence of KCl, the enzyme is also activated by ADP and ATP. These results show that a univalent cation can act as an allosteric activator of muscle AMP deaminase and that K+ is not required for the catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1554316381,"Photooxidation of extramitochondrial α-aspartate aminotransferase in the presence of methylene blue or Rose bengal leads to a loss of enzymatic activity which follows first order kinetics. Amino acid analysis shows that histidine is the only amino acid residue significantly affected by photooxidation. Of the 8 histidine residues present in the enzyme monomer, 2 are oxidized rapidly at a rate identical with that of the activity loss, while the other 6 are destroyed much more slowly. The pH dependence of the rate of the photo-induced inactivation of the enzyme corresponds to that expected for the photooxidation of imidazole groups. The behavior of the enzyme in Sephadex G-200 is identical before and after extensive photooxidation, while the starch gel electrophoretic pattern changes after photooxidation. It is concluded that the loss of enzyme activity caused by photooxidation is related to the destruction of 1 histidine residue."

When the rabbits were 30 days old, the loss of dendrite spines was limited to the oblique branches of apical dendrites in the parietal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1486812277,"Abstract Procedures are described for the preparation of highly purified streptokinase by column chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose and by column electrophoresis in a sucrose density gradient. Preparations chromatographed at least twice on diethylaminoethyl cellulose are shown to be essentially monodisperse on the basis of ultracentrifugal and gel electrophoretic analyses and constancy of specific activity. In good agreement with a previous finding from this laboratory, the molecular weight determined by equilibrium sedimentation was found to be 47,600. Treatment of streptokinase at pH 7.5 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer with 5 m guanidine-hydrochloride or 8 m urea produced a lowering of the sedimentation coefficient without significantly changing the molecular weight. Cystine and cysteine were absent on amino acid analysis, and the molecule is therefore assumed to consist of a single polypeptide chain with no subunits. The isoelectric point was found to be about pH 4.7. The amino acid composition is consistent with the formula Asp68-Thr30-Ser24-Glu46-Pro20-Gly21-Ala23-Val23-Met3-Ile22 Leu40-Tyr20-Phe15-Lys33-His9-Arg21-Try1 for molecular weight 47,754. Approximately 60 aspartic and glutamic residues are amidated per molecule of protein. The most highly purified preparations are devoid of carbohydrate and phosphorus and are inactive with basic amino acid esters, naphthyl esters, and acetyltyrosine ethyl ester as substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1660061067,"Abstract The early, de-embryonated chick blastoderm, cultured in vitro, closely simulates a phased culture of erythroid cells. This fact permits the study of hemoglobin synthesis from colorless erythroblast precursor cells to fully hemoglobinated erythrocytes. When δ-aminolevulinic acid is added to colorless blastoderms, thereby by-passing δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase, copious amounts of porphyrins, and presumably of heme, are formed. This result indicates that in the erythroid precursor cells of the early blastoderms heme synthesis is limited by the activity of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase. The addition of δ-aminolevulinate also results in an increase in globin synthesis and hemoglobin formation. The enhancing effect of δ-aminolevulinic acid on hemoglobin formation is not abolished by actinomycin D but is prevented by puromycin. This result suggests that δ-aminolevulinic acid forms heme which stimulates globin synthesis at the ribosome level. It is conjectured that heme may be necessary for the appropriate folding of the globin polypeptide in the completion of its synthesis. The hypothesis is proposed that the formation of δ-aminovulinic acid synthetase, which is under repressor control, is the limiting and controlling reaction in the formation of hemoglobin. Such a hypothesis would explain the fact that no free globin is formed and that monomeric globin and heme are formed in a 1:1 ratio."
https://openalex.org/W1552062289,"Abstract The kinetic behaviour of a highly purified nucleoside diphosphokinase of bovine liver mitochondria was found to be a very complex function of the concentrations of adenosine di- and triphosphate and Mg++, as well as the pH. At low ADP and excess Mg++ concentrations, the kinetic behavior is consistent with an ordered bimolecular ping-pong mechanism in which the true substrates are MgATP and either free MgADP or ADP. The enzyme is inhibited by higher concentrations of MgADP to an extent which depends on the concentration of MgATP. The enzyme is also inhibited by high concentrations of MgATP; however, MgADP is about 50 times more inhibitory than MgATP. At high levels of MgADP, the saturation curve for MgATP becomes sigmoid, with Hill interaction coefficients approaching the integral value 2.0. It has also been found that the affinity for ADP (or MgADP) as substrate and the inhibitory activity of MgADP may vary independently with pH. Furthermore, the molecular specificity of the different nucleoside 5'-diphosphates (NDP) for maximum inhibition differs from the nucleotide specificity for the catalytic event; inhibition by any given MgNDP is also dependent on the identity of the MgNTP partner. These results indicate that the mitochondrial nucleoside diphosphokinase has certain of the properties of a regulatory enzyme and that it contains two or more binding sites for the substrates, which can function either as substrates or as inhibitors, depending on the relative concentrations of ATP, ADP, and Mg++."
https://openalex.org/W1557942982,"Types MM, NN, and MN blood group substances have been isolated. All three materials are glycoproteins containing about 24% N-acetylneuraminic acid, 10% galactosamine, 5% glucosamine, and 14% galactose. The hexosamines appear to be N-acetylated. Amino acid analysis of the glycoproteins reveals them to be similar in composition and to be especially rich in serine and threonine. Treatment of the types MM and NN glycoproteins with alkali resulted in a decrease of serine and threonine, suggesting that these two amino acids may be involved in linkage to the oligosaccharide moieties. The native glycoproteins seem to be more resistant to alkali cleavage of the carbohydrate-protein linkage than the sialic acid-free glycoproteins. All three of the glycoproteins seem to be equally susceptible to the action of neuraminidase."
https://openalex.org/W1550504899,"Acid extracts of cysts and newly hatched nauplii of Artemia salina contain large amounts of guanine derivatives but only very small amounts of adenine compounds. As the nauplii undergo further differentiation, the total purine concentration remains constant, but the total adenine concentration increases. The increase in total adenine equals the decrease in total guanine. Since the nauplii are incapable of synthesizing purines de novo, a direct conversion of guanine compounds to adenine compounds must occur. Furthermore, P1,P4-diguanosine 5'-tetraphosphate appears to serve as a direct precursor of adenosine triphosphate, its guanine moiety being converted to adenine and its pyrophosphate bonds being conserved in the transition. The other guanine-containing compounds of the acid-soluble pool appear to serve as a source of nucleic acid guanine."

The ratio of hypoxanthine to xanthine is from 2:1 to 3:1 and results from increased hypoxanthine excretion, in contrast to other hyperuricosuric conditions where ratios of less than one have been reported. Administration of allopurinol (a xanthine-oxidase inhibitor) reduces the excretion of uric acid but results in an equivalent increase in xanthine and hypoxanthine.

https://openalex.org/W1573279458,"Changes in the amounts of acid-soluble nucleotides during embryonic development of the encysted egg of the brine shrimp, Artemia salina, have been determined. Significant quantities of diguanosine tetraphosphate, the most abundant compound in the nucleotide pool, are apparently not utilized until hatching, at which time the amount falls precipitously. Diguanosine triphosphate, a homologue of the tetraphosphate, does not change appreciably in amount throughout development, but may participate in a reaction catalyzed by a nucleoside phosphokinase. Adenosine triphosphate increases over 5-fold during the first few hours of development and again after hatching, but is virtually absent from the dormant cyst. Early development is associated with the rapid appearance of nucleotides in the hatch medium. These nucleotides appear to arise by diffusion from cracked and nonviable eggs and not by an active secretory process of the normally developing embryo."

Treatment of plasma with neuraminidase converted the faster-migrating form of both enzymes to slower-moving forms, but plasmas with slowermigrating forms were unaffected by this treatment. The two forms of the enzymes may be due to the presence or absence of a single gene controlling the attachment of sialic acid to the enzyme molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1594991203,"Abstract Heat inactivation of transfer ribonucleic acids at 90° in a solvent of neutral pH and moderate concentration of monovalent salts leads to a 63% loss (1 hit per molecule) of three different biological functions in about 10 hours. Addition of Mg++ increases the rate of inactivation 20-fold. While chain scission is shown to be the most important mechanism of inactivation in the presence of Mg++, it accounts for only 20 to 50% of the inactivation in the absence of Mg++. Whereas depurination, deamination, and aggregation have been ruled out as additional important means of heat inactivation in the absence of Mg++, the destruction of 5,6-dihydrouridylic acid residues appears to be a quantitatively significant one."

https://openalex.org/W1571921748,"Abstract The reactions of ferricytochrome c with anionic ligands involve the fission of one of the bonds to basic groups that hold the heme firmly within a crevice in the polypeptide structure. Denoting the group by X, the reactions thus take the form [see PDF for equation] where L is ligand and Pr is the protein liberated by the incoming ligand. With ferricytochrome c, the [H+] dependence of the equilibrium constant for complex formation is determined by the ionization equilibrium of the ligand species HL ⇌ H+ + L-, the coordinated water molecule -Fe+-H2O ⇌ FeOH + H+, and the nitrogenous base group which is liberrated -XH+ ⇌ X + H+. Studies of the equilibrium constants for the formation of the azide and cyanide complexes, over the pH range 4 to 8, show that there is a change in the [H+] dependence for both reactions at about pH 5. At 26° and ionic strength of 0.03, the following values were found: pKxH+ = 4.98 with ΔH = +9.2 kcal per mole and ΔS = +8 e.u. This indicates that the bond to the Fe, which is broken in complex formation, involves the glyoxalinium nitrogen atom of a histidine residue. The stability constants for the formation of the closed crevice form of ferricytochrome c at 26° and ionic strength of 0.03 are ΔF = -3.5 kcal per mole, ΔH = -18.0 kcal per mole, and ΔS = -48 e.u. At higher ionic strengths, deviations were observed from the pH dependence noted above. An extension of the mathematical analysis to include another group capable of accepting a proton leads to an expression for the equilibrium constant of the same form, and, on this basis, calculation shows that the pK would be about 4.4."

https://openalex.org/W1515359053,"Abstract The effect of detergents on the activity of palmityl coenzyme A:carnitine O-palmityltransferase (EC 2.3.1.-) has been investigated. A series of detergents (d-palmitylcarnitine, palmitylcholine, caprinylcholine, free fatty acids, deoxycholate, digitonin, Tween 20, Tween 80, and Triton X-100) have been found to stimulate the incorporation of l-carnitine-CH3-3H into l-palmitylcarnitine in the presence of CoA. The effects of d-palmitylcarnitine and Tween 80 were investigated further by studying their effects on the reaction Palmityl-CoA + carnitine ⇆ palmitylcarnitine + CoA in both directions. The effects of these detergents were found to depend on the concentration of palmityl-CoA in the reaction mixture. With high concentrations of palmityl-CoA, the detergents stimulated the transfer of palmityl groups from palmityl-CoA to carnitine. Concomitantly, the apparent Km for carnitine decreased. With low concentrations of palmityl-CoA, the detergents were inhibitory to palmityl transfer. In this case no significant change in the Km for carnitine was observed. The detergents initially had no or only a weak inhibitory effect on the palmityl transfer from palmitylcarnitine to CoA, but, as the reaction proceeded, their effect changed to stimulation because they prevented a strong product inhibition by palmityl-CoA. The mechanism of the detergent action is discussed, and it is concluded that their main effect is to prevent palmityl-CoA from acting as a competitive inhibitor of l-carnitine (and l-palmitylcarnitine). The substrate function of palmityl-CoA is also interfered with, but to a relatively much smaller extent than its inhibitory function."
https://openalex.org/W1537335716,"Abstract Oxygen exchange reactions in sonically prepared submitochondrial particles show a nearly absolute dependence upon added adenine nucleotides. The orthophosphate ⇌ adenosine triphosphate and the ATP ⇌ HOH exchange reactions, in contrast to the Pi ⇌ HOH exchange, are favored by presence of ADP rather than ATP, are more sensitive to p-mercuribenzoate and to 2,4-dinitrophenol, and require a higher Mg++ concentration. The marked disparities in exchange rates at low ADP concentrations are theoretically incompatible with a reaction scheme involving only one point of entry of water oxygen. The ATP-driven energy-linked reduction, ATPase activity, and a prominent Pi ⇌ HOH exchange will proceed at much lower Mg++ concentrations than required for the ATP ⇌ HOH and Pi ⇌ ATP exchanges. The Pi ⇌ HOH exchange induced by ATP cleavage occurs principally with Pi of the medium. The ATP ⇌ HOH exchange, but not the Pi ⇌ HOH exchange, appears to occur only in association with oxidative phosphorylation. Reactions separate from the phosphorylation reaction of oxidative phosphorylation appear responsible for ATP-driven energy-linked reduction, ATPase activity, and a prominent Pi ⇌ HOH exchange. These and other results are consistent with a mechanism for oxidative phosphorylation in which a high energy compound or state, independent from concomitant oxidation-reduction, drives water formation directly from an oxygen of Pi, resulting in ATP formation by a concerted reaction or with transient metaphosphate formation. Present data do not, however, eliminate an indirect route of oxygen from Pi to water."

https://openalex.org/W2124150288,"Abstract The number of Ca++ ions accumulated per pair of electrons passing through each energy-conserving site of the respiratory chain during Ca++-induced respiratory jumps in isolated rat liver mitochondria (i.e. the Ca++: ∼ ratio) is normally approximately 2.0 when the suspending medium contains 80 mm KCl or NaCl at pH 7.4, but no permeant anion. However, when the concentration of impermeant salts is raised to as high as 240 mm, or when the pH is raised to above 8.0, the Ca++ ∼ ratio increases to values exceeding 4.0 to 5.0, primarily because of a decrease in the amount of extra oxygen uptake evoked by addition of Ca++. The ratio H+ ejected: ∼ also increases in proportion to the Ca++: ∼ ratio. Increase in sodium chloride concentration does not influence the adenosine diphosphate to oxygen ratio of oxidative phosphorylation. Such super-stoichiometric ratios of Ca++ uptake are almost completely dependent on electron transport, and occur in the presence of high concentration of impermeant anions such as chloride, bromide, iodide, and thiocyanate, but not when such salts are replaced with sucrose. In the presence of permeant anions, such as phosphate, the Ca++: ∼ ratio remains constant at about 2.0. The possible causes of the apparently flexible stoichiometry of Ca++ uptake and H+ ejection with electron transport in the absence of phosphate are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1507595761,"Abstract The activator constant, Ka, of calcium in the transglutaminase reaction has been estimated from kinetic studies as 6.9 ± 1.5 x 10-3 m at pH 6 in 0.1 m tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane-acetate, 25°. The dissociation constant, Kd, for the calcium-transglutaminase complex, determined by two direct binding experiments, was found to be 8 ± 2 x 10-3 m at pH 6 in 0.1 m Tris-acetate containing 0.5 m NaCl, 25° (ultraviolet difference spectrophotometry), and 7.9 ± 1.5 x 10-3 m at pH 6 in 0.1 m Tris-acetate, 25° (protection against irreversible inhibition). The Km for carbobenzoxy-l-glutaminylglycine with the fully activated calcium enzyme and the maximum turnover number with this substrate were found to be 21.7 ±4 x 10-3 m and 3600 ± 300 min-1, respectively. The Ka of strontium and the Kd (difference spectrophotometry) for the strontium-transglutaminase complex have been determined as 80 ± 20 x 10-3m and 90 ± 25 x 10-3m, respectively. The maximum turnover number for carbobenzoxy-l-glutaminylglycine is essentially that observed for the calcium-activated enzyme, while the Km for this substrate with the fully strontium-activated enzyme was found to be 75 ± 10 x 10-3 m. Carbobenzoxy-l-phenylalanine inhibits transglutaminase in a reversible competitive manner. The apparent inhibitor constant for this compound is a function of the calcium concentration at less than saturating levels of metal ion. The inhibitor constant, Ki, for carbobenzoxy-l-phenylalanine with the fully activated calcium enzyme was estimated as 8 ± 3 x 10-3 m. At less than saturating levels of calcium ion, the degree of protection against irreversible inhibition of transglutaminase by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was observed to be a function of carbobenzoxy-l-phenylalanine concentration. No protection by carbobenzoxy-l-phenylalanine against this irreversible inhibitor was observed in the absence of activating metal ion. The reversible competitive inhibition afforded by chloracetic acid was characterized by the same observed Ki value at two low levels of calcium ion. This competitive inhibitor showed no protection against irreversible enzyme inhibition either in the presence or absence of calcium ion. These facts are consistent with a mechanism in which transglutaminase functions in combination with the divalent cation as a metal-enzyme complex. The results also suggest that a conformational change in the enzyme protein occurs upon combination with activator metal."

Conditions for this reaction are described. Only one of the products, denoted as Fraction V, which is separated by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography, served as a substrate for the enzymatic release of formate and the synthesis of dihydrofolate. In addition, Fraction V was converted enzymatically to 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-substituted pteridines. Analyses of Fraction V indicated that it contains a pentose moiety, 3 phosphate residues, and an acid-labile formyl group. Treatment by glyoxal produced 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine. The ultraviolet absorption spectra of Fraction V are also presented. These results suggest that Fraction V is identical with or similar to the immediate formamidopyrimidine derivative from GTP and may be an intermediate of pteridine biosynthesis from GTP."
https://openalex.org/W2035101520,"Acetylcholine, the inhibitory transmitter to the so-called H-neurons of molluscs, produces its effect by increasing the permeability of the subsynaptic membrane to chloride ions. The change in permeability gives rise to a net influx of this anion, which hyperpolarizes the neuron. The presence of an outward pump of chloride ions is postulated to account for the required electrochemical gradient. The participation of potassium ions in this inhibitory phenomenon was not detected."
https://openalex.org/W1516177622,"Abstract Osmotic pressure technique has been employed to investigate the polymerization of bovine αs-casein B under different experimental conditions. Results at neutral pH indicate that the polymerization of αs-casein B depends much more on ionic strength than on temperature. The number average molecular weight of αs-casein B in 0.01 m KCI, pH 7, at 20° was found to be 29,400 which corresponds to the monomer, whereas the value at 0.1 m KC1 corresponds to that of a trimer. Viscosity and diffusion data suggest that even though αs-casein B is more flexible and possibly more solvated than a common globular protein, it is much more compact than a denatured protein. The results of the optical rotatory dispersion study indicate that there is no gross conformational change as the protein is polymerized from monomer to trimer or tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1480051637,"Two strains of Penicillium patulum have been isolated from cultures of NRRL 2159A. One produces 6-methylsalicyclic acid (MSA) very soon after transfer of mycelium from a germinating medium to Czapek-Dox medium and is designated an early MSA strain. In the other, 6-methylsalicyclic acid production begins only after 24 to 36 hours on Czapek-Dox medium, and it is designated a late MSA strain. Cell-free extracts of the early MSA strain incorporate about 3 mµmoles of 1,3-14C-malonylcoenzyme A per mg of protein into 6-methylsalicylic acid in a 10-min incubation. This activity is only a small fraction of the synthetic capacity in vivo of the mycelium but is about 7-fold higher than the maximum activity found in the late MSA strain extracts and is higher than activities reported for other crude preparations. Chemical degradation of the product after recrystallization with carrier shows that one-third of the radioactivity is in the carboxyl group, which is consistent with an acetyl polymalonyl biosynthetic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1579752539,"Abstract The initial stage in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan is catalyzed by phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase (uridine 5'-phosphate) according to the reaction UDP-NAc-muramyl-pentapeptide + lipid-glycerol-phosphate ⇄ lipid-glycerol-diphosphate-NAc-muramyl-pentapeptide + UMP When Staphylococcus aureus is grown in the presence of 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluoro-UDP-NAc-muramyl-pentapeptide accumulates. The rate of transfer of phospho-NAc-muramyl-pentapeptide from 1.6 x 10-5 m 5-fluoro-UDP-NAc-muramyl-pentapeptide to lipid-glycerol-phosphate is less than 2% of of that observed with 1.9 x 10-5 m UDP-NAc-muramyl-pentapeptide. 5-Fluoro-UDP-NAc-muramyl-pentapeptide is a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 1.2 x 10-4 m) in the transfer reaction. In addition to the transfer reaction, the translocase catalyzes the exchange of uridylic acid-3H with the UMP moiety of UDP-NAc-muramyl-pentapeptide. If UMP-3H is replaced with 5-fluoro-UMP-3H, the rate of exchange is less than 0.5% of that observed with uridylic acid-3H. 5-Fluoro-UMP is a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 5 x 10-5 m) of the exchange reaction. In contrast to the translocase, 5-fluoro substitution has no significant effect on the reaction catalyzed by UDP-N-acetyl-muramoyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamate:l-lysine ligase (ADP) (EC 6.3.2.7). Since 5-fluoro-UDP-NAc-muramyl-pentapeptide is a poor substrate in the reaction catalyzed by the translocase, peptidoglycan synthesis is inhibited and the fluoro-substituted precursor accumulates."
https://openalex.org/W1600213510,"Abstract 1. Submitochondrial particles from beef heart, that were partially depleted of coupling factors, required the addition of coupling Factors 1 and 4 to catalyze the adenosine triphosphate-dependent H218O-inorganic phosphate exchange and the H218O-ATP exchange. The H218O-Pi exchange during succinate oxidation required catalytic amounts of adenine nucleotide as well as both coupling factors. An antiserum against coupling Factor 1 inhibited this exchange. 2. Levels of oligomycin which stimulated oxidative phosphorylation markedly inhibited the H218O-Pi exchange that took place under the same conditions. Both the H218O-Pi and the H218O-ATP exchange reactions were inhibited when ADP was removed by an ATP-regenerating system. The H218O-ATP exchange was stimulated by Pi. The significance of these findings with respect to current concepts of the mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1521376176,"The properties of the glucose 6-phosphate-dependent forms of glycogen synthetase obtained by incubation with calcium ions or with adenosine triphosphate were compared. The two preparations showed different sensitivity to the action of heat and trypsin. In addition, the synthetase obtained with adenosine triphosphate is reconvertible to the independent form while that prepared with Ca++ is not. The possible physiological role of the two different mechanisms of formation of the glucose 6-phosphate-dependent forms of glycogen synthetase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1538758485,"Abstract Hydroxyproline-induced α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase has been purified from a pseudomonas strain and characterized with respect to substrate specificity and other properties. After a variety of growth conditions, pseudomonas extracts also contain a constitutive dehydrogenase, which differs from the induced enzyme in sedimentation and electrophoretic behavior. Although the constitutive enzyme resembles the induced form in many kinetic respects, it is relatively more active with glutaric semialdehyde as a substrate and is tentatively assigned a role in lysine metabolism. Growth on d-glucarate induces a dehydrogenase which, in all kinetic and physical respects examined, appears identical with that induced by growth on hydroxyproline."
https://openalex.org/W1600386991,"Abstract Many of the stability characteristics of horse ferrihemoglobin (Hb+) in acid solutions, such as pH dependence and susceptibility to stabilization by iron ligands, are shared by human ferrihemoglobin, but striking differences between the two proteins exist. The most noticeable is the much greater rate of denaturation of the human protein at all pH values. Other differences include a shift to higher pH in the equilibrium between native and acid-denatured forms, differences in the temperature at which the temperature effect on the equilibrium-pH curve reverses, a complete absence in human Hb+ of the dependence of regeneration rate on extent of denaturation that is found with horse Hb+, and a related failure of the regeneration kinetics of human Hb+ to follow the inhibited regeneration model developed for horse Hb+. pH-stat experiments, and rapid flow titration curves of both native and denatured forms, indicate that human Hb+ has about four more masked groups (presumably imidazoles) than horse Hb+, although both proteins contain the same number of histidine residues. Although regeneration as measured by reappearance of the Soret band occurs readily, there is very little remasking of the liberated groups unless a stabilizing ligand (cyanide) is present; even then recovery is far from complete. It has been observed with both proteins that the band at 370 mµ, characteristic of denatured oxidized heme-protein complexes, disappears much more rapidly during regeneration than the Soret band, characteristic of native protein, reappears. The discrepancy is more marked with human than with horse Hb+."
https://openalex.org/W2002163105,Spectacular reversals of the photoperiodic control of diapause are obtained if females of Nasonia vitripennis are chilled for 4 hours in certain light-dark cycles. Experiments in which chilling is combined with short light breaks (night interruptions) show that the first peak of diapause inhibition moves in response to the chilling. This result provides an explanation for the photoperiodic reversal; it is also circumstantial evidence for the participation of circadian rhythms in photoperiodism.
https://openalex.org/W1627046708,"Abstract Although Escherichia coli does not readily utilize exogenous thymine for the synthesis of its deoxyribonucleic acid, cells infected with the T-even bacteriophages efficiently incorporate the exogenous base into viral DNA. The primary change induced by infection involves the entry of thymine into the cell. This alteration requires injection of the infecting viral DNA, as well as subsequent protein synthesis, but is independent of the formation of new viral DNA. It does not appear to be the result of permeability changes or of alterations in the enzymes which regulate the uptake of thymine. The results support the proposal that the uptake of exogenous thymine depends on the availability of deoxyribosyl donors for the synthesis of deoxythymidine. The altered uptake of thymine after infection probably results from a virus-induced accumulation of these deoxyribosyl donors."
https://openalex.org/W1545539970,"Abstract Chromatographically homogeneous egg white lysozyme has been subjected under reduced pressure to 0.67-m.e.v. γ-rays. At 37% destruction of enzymic activity, three inactive aggregates and one partially active fraction have been isolated by salt precipitation and chromatographic procedures. The aggregates, upon reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol and reaction with iodoacetic acid, give derivatives with molecular weights of 12,000 to 15,750 in comparison with one of 14,500 for reduced carboxymethylated lysozyme. One urea-insoluble aggregate becomes soluble upon reduction and, after air oxidation, in dilute solution gives active enzyme in 15% yield. Mixed disulfides of cystine and this or other inactive fractions also give significant (10 to 20%) yields of active enzyme upon incubation with cysteine. Disulfide analyses showed close to the expected number of disulfide bonds in two of the mixed disulfide derivatives if one assumes no fragmentation but simply aggregation of lysozyme monomer molecules. Amino acid and disulfide content of the active component from reactivation of one mixed disulfide derivative agreed well with that found for the active component from reactivation of the mixed disulfide of native lysozyme. Thus a significant portion (15 to 20%) of radiation inactivation in solid lysozyme can be explained by the rupture of disulfide bonds followed by formation of incorrect intermolecular disulfide bonds."

https://openalex.org/W1594459019,"Abstract Contraction of glycerinated muscle fibers in adenosine triphosphate solution is inhibited by pretreatment for several hours in solutions of bis-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)lysine (bis-DNP-lysine) at concentrations greater than about 5 x 10-4 m at 20°, pH 7, and ionic strength 0.1. Contraction is also inhibited by solutions of bis-DNP-ornithine and, to some extent, by solutions of DNP-isoleucine, DNP-leucine, and e-N-DNP-lysine, although higher concentrations are needed. DNP-glycine, DNP-valine, DNP-glutamic acid, and 2, 4-dinitrophenol are ineffective under the same conditions. Solutions of bis-DNP-lysine also inhibit the contraction of actomyosin threads. Bis-DNP-lysine is readily absorbed from solution by fresh or glycerinated muscle fibers; at a concentration of 15 x 10-4m, about 30 moles are absorbed per 105 g of dry muscle. The extent of absorption increases with increasing bis-DNP-lysine concentration, and simple absorption equations are not obeyed. Absorption is increased after the fibers have been treated with sulfhydryl group reagents: most of the absorbed bis-DNP-lysine is readily removed by washing with buffer, but a proportion, which increases with increasing duration of treatment, is strongly retained. Fiber extensibility is greatly increased by treatment with bis-DNP-lysine. Prolonged treatment causes dissolution of some of the protein, and the fibers shrink. Electron micrographs suggest that during treatment the Z-line and the m-line are dissolved or altered. The effects of sodium deoxycholate and sodium lauryl sulfate on muscle fibers are similar to those of the inhibitory dinitrophenyl compounds. Other contraction inhibitors studied under the same conditions, viz. cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide, acridine orange, and various sulfhydryl group reagents, appear to act in a different way. It is suggested that bis-DNP-lysine inhibits muscle contraction by displacing accessible polypeptide chains of myosin that are essential for the contractile mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1595902135,The rate equations for cofactor-activated enzyme kinetics have been developed from initial velocity-steady state equations by incorporation of a conservation equation for cofactor. This is required for systems in which the concentration of free cofactor is significantly different from the concentration of total cofactor. Solutions to the equations have been calculated and plotted to illustrate the dependence of the kinetic parameters on cofactor and enzyme concentrations. Methods for the determination and analysis of the kinetic parameters are outlined. The dependence of these parameters on mechanism is listed for a series of three substrate mechanisms in which one of the substrates is the cofactor. This kinetic approach appears to be required by at least two copper enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of substrates by molecular oxygen.

Before and after viewing the responding right hand with the left eye through a small aperture, observers were required manually to indicate a point in line with the center without visual guidance. Apparent displacement of the limb due to monocular viewing resulted in a change in the direction of responding. This change in response direction (termed behavioral compensation) is similar to that which occurs when the spatial properties of stimulation are modified with an optical system."
