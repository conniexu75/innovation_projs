https://openalex.org/W2182098131,"Automatic classification of tissue types of region of interest (ROI) plays an important role in computer-aided diagnosis. In the current study, we focus on the classification of three types of brain tumors (i.e., meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumor) in T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) images. Spatial pyramid matching (SPM), which splits the image into increasingly fine rectangular subregions and computes histograms of local features from each subregion, exhibits excellent results for natural scene classification. However, this approach is not applicable for brain tumors, because of the great variations in tumor shape and size. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance the classification performance. First, the augmented tumor region via image dilation is used as the ROI instead of the original tumor region because tumor surrounding tissues can also offer important clues for tumor types. Second, the augmented tumor region is split into increasingly fine ring-form subregions. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method on a large dataset with three feature extraction methods, namely, intensity histogram, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and bag-of-words (BoW) model. Compared with using tumor region as ROI, using augmented tumor region as ROI improves the accuracies to 82.31% from 71.39%, 84.75% from 78.18%, and 88.19% from 83.54% for intensity histogram, GLCM, and BoW model, respectively. In addition to region augmentation, ring-form partition can further improve the accuracies up to 87.54%, 89.72%, and 91.28%. These experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible and effective for the classification of brain tumors in T1-weighted CE-MRI."
https://openalex.org/W2202848214,"The use of temozolomide (TMZ) has improved the prognosis for glioblastoma multiforme patients. However, TMZ resistance may be one of the main reasons why treatment fails. Although this resistance has frequently been linked to the expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) it seems that this enzyme is not the only molecular mechanism that may account for the appearance of drug resistance in glioblastoma multiforme patients as the mismatch repair (MMR) complex, P-glycoprotein, and/or the presence of cancer stem cells may also be implicated.Four nervous system tumor cell lines were used to analyze the modulation of MGMT expression and MGMT promoter methylation by TMZ treatment. Furthermore, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was used to demethylate the MGMT promoter and O(6)-benzylguanine to block GMT activity. In addition, MMR complex and P-glycoprotein expression were studied before and after TMZ exposure and correlated with MGMT expression. Finally, the effect of TMZ exposure on CD133 expression was analyzed.Our results showed two clearly differentiated groups of tumor cells characterized by low (A172 and LN229) and high (SF268 and SK-N-SH) basal MGMT expression. Interestingly, cell lines with no MGMT expression and low TMZ IC50 showed a high MMR complex expression, whereas cell lines with high MGMT expression and high TMZ IC50 did not express the MMR complex. In addition, modulation of MGMT expression in A172 and LN229 cell lines was accompanied by a significant increase in the TMZ IC50, whereas no differences were observed in SF268 and SK-N-SH cell lines. In contrast, P-glycoprotein and CD133 was found to be unrelated to TMZ resistance in these cell lines.These results may be relevant in understanding the phenomenon of TMZ resistance, especially in glioblastoma multiforme patients laking MGMT expression, and may also aid in the design of new therapeutic strategies to improve the efficacy of TMZ in glioblastoma multiforme patients."
https://openalex.org/W2276550096,"Effective control of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and proliferation is critical to the treatment of liver fibrosis. Long non-coding RNAs have been shown to play a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular processes. It has been reported that growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) acts as a crucial mediator in the control of cell proliferation and growth. However, little is known about the role and underlying mechanism of GAS5 in liver fibrosis. In this study, our results indicated that GAS5 expression was reduced in mouse, rat, and human fibrotic liver samples and in activated HSCs. Overexpression of GAS5 suppressed the activation of primary HSCs in vitro and alleviated the accumulation of collagen in fibrotic liver tissues in vivo. We identified GAS5 as a target of microRNA-222 (miR-222) and showed that miR-222 could inhibit the expression of GAS5. Interestingly, GAS5 could also repress miR-222 expression. A pulldown assay further validated that GAS5 could directly bind to miR-222. As a competing endogenous RNAs, GAS5 had no effect on primary miR-222 expression. In addition, GAS5 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm. Quantitative RT-PCR further demonstrated that the copy numbers of GAS5 per cell are higher than those of miR-222. GAS5 increased the level of p27 protein by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-222, thereby inhibiting the activation and proliferation of HSCs. Taken together, a new regulatory circuitry in liver fibrosis has been identified in which RNAs cross-talk by competing for shared microRNAs. Our findings may provide a new therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2342068523,"Sepsis is associated with increased mortality, delirium and long-term cognitive impairment in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities occurring at the acute stage of sepsis may correlate with severity of brain dysfunction. Predictive value of early standard EEG abnormalities for mortality in ICU septic patients remains to be assessed.In this prospective, single center, observational study, standard EEG was performed, analyzed and classified according to both Synek and Young EEG scales, in consecutive patients acutely admitted in ICU for sepsis. Delirium, coma and the level of sedation were assessed at the time of EEG recording; and duration of sedation, occurrence of in-ICU delirium or death were assessed during follow-up. Adjusted analyses were carried out using multiple logistic regression.One hundred ten patients were included, mean age 63.8 (±18.1) years, median SAPS-II score 38 (29-55). At the time of EEG recording, 46 patients (42%) were sedated and 22 (20%) suffered from delirium. Overall, 54 patients (49%) developed delirium, of which 32 (29%) in the days after EEG recording. 23 (21%) patients died in the ICU. Absence of EEG reactivity was observed in 27 patients (25%), periodic discharges (PDs) in 21 (19%) and electrographic seizures (ESZ) in 17 (15%). ICU mortality was independently associated with a delta-predominant background (OR: 3.36; 95% CI [1.08 to 10.4]), absence of EEG reactivity (OR: 4.44; 95% CI [1.37-14.3], PDs (OR: 3.24; 95% CI [1.03 to 10.2]), Synek grade ≥ 3 (OR: 5.35; 95% CI [1.66-17.2]) and Young grade > 1 (OR: 3.44; 95% CI [1.09-10.8]) after adjustment to Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-II) at admission and level of sedation. Delirium at the time of EEG was associated with ESZ in non-sedated patients (32% vs 10%, p = 0.037); with Synek grade ≥ 3 (36% vs 7%, p< 0.05) and Young grade > 1 (36% vs 17%, p< 0.001). Occurrence of delirium in the days after EEG was associated with a delta-predominant background (48% vs 15%, p = 0.001); absence of reactivity (39% vs 10%, p = 0.003), Synek grade ≥ 3 (42% vs 17%, p = 0.001) and Young grade >1 (58% vs 17%, p = 0.0001).In this prospective cohort of 110 septic ICU patients, early standard EEG was significantly disturbed. Absence of EEG reactivity, a delta-predominant background, PDs, Synek grade ≥ 3 and Young grade > 1 at day 1 to 3 following admission were independent predictors of ICU mortality and were associated with occurence of delirium. ESZ and PDs, found in about 20% of our patients. Their prevalence could have been higher, with a still higher predictive value, if they had been diagnosed more thoroughly using continuous EEG."
https://openalex.org/W2183350218,"Dynamic cycling of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on nucleocytoplasmic proteins serves as a nutrient sensor to regulate numerous biological processes. However, mitochondrial protein O-GlcNAcylation and its effects on function are largely unexplored. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of the proteome and O-GlcNAcome of cardiac mitochondria from rats acutely (12 h) treated without or with thiamet-G (TMG), a potent and specific inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase. We then determined the functional consequences in mitochondria isolated from the two groups. O-GlcNAcomic profiling finds that over 88 mitochondrial proteins are O-GlcNAcylated, with the oxidative phosphorylation system as a major target. Moreover, in comparison with controls, cardiac mitochondria from TMG-treated rats did not exhibit altered protein abundance but showed overall elevated O-GlcNAcylation of many proteins. However, O-GlcNAc was unexpectedly down-regulated at certain sites of specific proteins. Concomitantly, TMG treatment resulted in significantly increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates, ATP production rates, and enhanced threshold for permeability transition pore opening by Ca2+. Our data reveal widespread and dynamic mitochondrial protein O-GlcNAcylation, serving as a regulator to their function."

Preferentially translated GADD34 (PPP1R15A) and constitutively expressed CReP (PPP1R15B) function to dephosphorylate eIF2α-P and restore protein synthesis. The 5′-leaders of GADD34 and CReP contain two upstream ORFs (uORFs). Using biochemical and genetic approaches we show that features of these uORFs are central for their differential expression. In the absence of stress, translation of an inhibitory uORF in GADD34 acts as a barrier that prevents reinitiation at the GADD34 coding region. Enhanced eIF2α-P during stress directs ribosome bypass of the uORF, facilitating translation of the GADD34 coding region. CReP expression occurs independent of eIF2α-P via an uORF that allows for translation reinitiation at the CReP coding region independent of stress. Importantly, alterations in the GADD34 uORF affect the status of eIF2α-P, translational control, and cell adaptation to stress. These results show that properties of uORFs that permit ribosome reinitiation are critical for directing gene-specific translational control in the integrated stress response.

https://openalex.org/W2154167050,"The main objective of this study was to determine growth, yield and fruit quality of grapevines under organic and biodynamic management in relation to integrated viticultural practices. Furthermore, the mechanisms for the observed changes in growth, yield and fruit quality were investigated by determining nutrient status, physiological performance of the plants and disease incidence on bunches in three consecutive growing seasons. A field trial (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Riesling) was set up at Hochschule Geisenheim University, Germany. The integrated treatment was managed according to the code of good practice. Organic and biodynamic plots were managed according to Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 and Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 and according to ECOVIN- and Demeter-Standards, respectively. The growth and yield of the grapevines differed strongly among the different management systems, whereas fruit quality was not affected by the management system. The organic and the biodynamic treatments showed significantly lower growth and yield in comparison to the integrated treatment. The physiological performance was significantly lower in the organic and the biodynamic systems, which may account for differences in growth and cluster weight and might therefore induce lower yields of the respective treatments. Soil management and fertilization strategy could be responsible factors for these changes. Yields of the organic and the biodynamic treatments partially decreased due to higher disease incidence of downy mildew. The organic and the biodynamic plant protection strategies that exclude the use of synthetic fungicides are likely to induce higher disease incidence and might partially account for differences in the nutrient status of vines under organic and biodynamic management. Use of the biodynamic preparations had little influence on vine growth and yield. Due to the investigation of important parameters that induce changes especially in growth and yield of grapevines under organic and biodynamic management the study can potentially provide guidance for defining more effective farming systems."
https://openalex.org/W2216571029,"An in-depth proteomic study of sheep milk whey is reported and compared to the data available in the literature for the cow whey proteome. A combinatorial peptide ligand library kit (ProteoMiner) was used to normalize protein abundance in the sheep whey proteome followed by an in-gel digest of a 1D-PAGE display and an in-solution digestion followed by OFFGEL isoelectric focusing fractionation. The peptide fractions obtained were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. This enabled identification of 669 proteins in sheep whey that, to our knowledge, is the largest inventory of sheep whey proteins identified to date. A comprehensive list of cow whey proteins currently available in the literature (783 proteins from unique genes) was assembled and compared to the sheep whey proteome data obtained in this study (606 proteins from unique genes). This comparison revealed that while the 233 proteins shared by the two species were significantly enriched for immune and inflammatory responses in gene ontology analysis, proteins only found in sheep whey in this study were identified that take part in both cellular development and immune responses, whereas proteins only found in cow whey in this study were identified to be associated with metabolism and cellular growth."
https://openalex.org/W2282748127,"In eukaryotic cells, membrane-bound vesicles carry cargo between intracellular compartments, to and from the cell surface, and into the extracellular environment. Many conserved families of proteins are required for properly localized vesicle fusion, including the multisubunit tethering complexes and the SNARE complexes. These protein complexes work together to promote proper vesicle fusion in intracellular trafficking pathways. However, the mechanism by which the exocyst, the exocytosis-specific multisubunit tethering complex, interacts with the exocytic SNAREs to mediate vesicle targeting and fusion is currently unknown. We have demonstrated previously that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae exocyst subunit Sec6 directly bound the plasma membrane SNARE protein Sec9 in vitro and that Sec6 inhibited the assembly of the binary Sso1-Sec9 SNARE complex. Therefore, we hypothesized that the interaction between Sec6 and Sec9 prevented the assembly of premature SNARE complexes at sites of exocytosis. To map the determinants of this interaction, we used cross-linking and mass spectrometry analyses to identify residues required for binding. Mutation of residues identified by this approach resulted in a growth defect when introduced into yeast. Contrary to our previous hypothesis, we discovered that Sec6 does not change the rate of SNARE assembly but, rather, binds both the binary Sec9-Sso1 and ternary Sec9-Sso1-Snc2 SNARE complexes. Together, these results suggest a new model in which Sec6 promotes SNARE complex assembly, similar to the role proposed for other tether subunit-SNARE interactions.

Intracellular trafficking is an essential, conserved, and highly regulated process in eukaryotic cells, characterized by the movement of membrane-bound vesicles between distinct organelles and cellular compartments. Vesicles bud from donor compartments, are trafficked to the proper target membrane, and subsequently fuse. These trafficking processes must be tightly regulated to ensure spatial and temporal delivery of vesicles to their cellular destination. Many conserved protein families are essential for trafficking, including the SNARE proteins that provide the impetus for membrane fusion (1.Jahn R. Scheller R.H.

Prior to complex formation, both Sec9 and Snc2 are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and fold into their helical SNARE conformations during assembly of the SNARE complex (10.Rice L.M.

This assembled SNARE complex is stable and requires the ATPase activity of the NSF and α-SNAP complex (Sec18 and Sec17 in yeast, respectively) for disassembly. Because of the energetic favorability of assembling the SNARE complex and the stability of the assembled complex, regulation of vesicle fusion necessitates the regulation of SNARE complex assembly (13.Söllner T.

Several lines of evidence indicate that specific control of SNARE complex assembly is required to prevent the formation of premature, mislocalized, or nonspecific SNARE complexes that may result in the incorrect delivery of important cargo. First, yeast SNAREs can form fusion-competent complexes promiscuously in vitro. Vesicles containing the exocytic Sso1-Sec9 t-SNARE complex can fuse with vesicles containing v-SNAREs other than Snc1/2 (15.McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Compartmental specificity of cellular membrane fusion encoded in SNARE proteins.Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), and vesicles loaded with the vacuolar t-SNARE complex (Vam3, Vti1, and Vam7) can fuse with vesicles containing non-vacuolar v-SNAREs, including the exocytic/endocytic Snc2 (16.Izawa R.

Chem. 2012; 287: 3445-3453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This promiscuity extends to mammalian cells; SNAREs from various intracellular compartments can form stable non-cognate SNARE complexes, suggesting that SNARE complex formation is not the sole determinant of specificity (17.Yang B. Gonzalez Jr., L. Prekeris R. Steegmaier M. Advani R.J. Scheller R.H. SNARE interactions are not selective: implications for membrane fusion specificity.J. Biol.

Commun. 2001; 285: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Secondly, the localization of Sec9 and Sso1 is not restricted to the yeast bud tips and mother-daughter necks where secretion is occurring. Instead, they are distributed along the plasma membrane (6.Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Sec9 is a SNAP-25-like component of a yeast SNARE complex that may be the effector of Sec4 function in exocytosis.Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). One level of regulation comes from Sso1. Like many syntaxins, Sso1 contains an autoinhibitory domain that can prevent premature binary Sso1-Sec9 complex assembly (20.Weimbs T. Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Bucher P. Hofmann K. A conserved domain is present in different families of vesicular fusion proteins: a new superfamily.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 21.Dietrich L.E. Boeddinghaus C. LaGrassa T.J. Ungermann C. Control of eukaryotic membrane fusion by N-terminal domains of SNARE proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, this autoinhibition is not absolute because SNARE complex assembly can proceed in vitro without the addition of putative “opening” factors, albeit at non-physiological rates (11.Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Regulation of SNARE complex assembly by an N-terminal domain of the t-SNARE Sso1p.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22.Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Interactions within the yeast t-SNARE Sso1p that control SNARE complex assembly.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mammalian exocytic SNAREs can form SNARE complexes that are not competent for fusion at the Golgi when not inhibited prior to trafficking to the cell surface (23.Medine C.N. Rickman C. Chamberlain L.H. Duncan R.R. Munc18–1 prevents the formation of ectopic SNARE complexes in living cells.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 4407-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, other levels of activation and/or inhibition are necessary to prevent inappropriate complex formation and subsequent vesicle fusion. In contrast to the SNAREs, several protein families are localized at sites of secretion and, therefore, well placed to provide additional control of exocytic SNARE complex assembly. One such example is the exocyst complex, the MTC that is thought to recognize and tether secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane prior to SNARE complex assembly (3.Heider M.R. Munson M. Exorcising the exocyst complex.Traffic. 2012; 13: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar and references therein). Consistent with a putative upstream tethering role, three of the eight exocyst subunits interact with lipids and small Rab and Rho family GTPases on the opposing membranes, although tethering has not yet been directly demonstrated (24.Zhang X.

In mammalian cells, knockdown of individual COG subunits leads to an increase in uncomplexed SNAREs and a decrease in overall SNARE expression (45.Shestakova A. Suvorova E. Pavliv O. Khaidakova G.

Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1179-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, for many MTCs, only the binding interactions with the SNAREs have been identified. The functional implications of most of these interactions have not been studied at the molecular level. Consistent with other MTC-SNARE interactions, we have shown previously that the yeast exocyst subunit Sec6 interacts with the C-terminal SNAP-25 domain of the plasma membrane t-SNARE Sec9 (Sec9CT, residues 414–651) (46.Sivaram M.V. Saporita J.A. Furgason M.L. Boettcher A.J. Munson M. Dimerization of the exocyst protein Sec6p and its interaction with the t-SNARE Sec9p.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6302-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, Sec6 appeared to inhibit, rather than promote or stabilize, in vitro formation of the Sso1-Sec9 binary SNARE complex (46.Sivaram M.V. Saporita J.A. Furgason M.L. Boettcher A.J. Munson M. Dimerization of the exocyst protein Sec6p and its interaction with the t-SNARE Sec9p.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6302-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposed that the Sec6-Sec9 interaction prevented premature assembly of the Sso1-Sec9 SNARE complex and that assembly of the exocyst complex could release Sec9 to form fusogenic SNARE complexes. To test these hypotheses, we sought to disrupt the Sec6-Sec9 interaction through mutagenesis without disrupting other protein-protein interactions with their critical binding partners. These mutants would then be useful reagents for testing the importance of this interaction in vivo. Because Sec9 is an IDP, the process of identifying the critical residues for the Sec6-Sec9 interaction was not straightforward. Previous attempts to identify a minimal region of Sec9 necessary for the interaction with Sec6, including limited proteolysis and truncation experiments, were inconclusive (46.Sivaram M.V. Saporita J.A. Furgason M.L. Boettcher A.J. Munson M. Dimerization of the exocyst protein Sec6p and its interaction with the t-SNARE Sec9p.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6302-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Identification of the minimal binding region of Sec6 was hindered by the insolubility of the N-terminal domain of Sec6. However, the C-terminal half of the protein has been shown to be insufficient for binding (46.Sivaram M.V. Saporita J.A. Furgason M.L. Boettcher A.J. Munson M. Dimerization of the exocyst protein Sec6p and its interaction with the t-SNARE Sec9p.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6302-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We were also limited by the flexible nature of Sec9. The binding sites of IDPs like Sec9 are difficult to identify because the protein can compensate for loss of one or more binding residues, and the native state of the IDP-ordered partner interaction often involves more than one locus with varying degrees of preference (57.Uversky V.N. Unusual biophysics of intrinsically disordered proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1834: 932-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar58.Uversky V.N.

Intrinsically disordered proteins in cellular signalling and regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 18-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Here we used a chemical cross-linking and tandem mass spectrometry approach to define the determinants of the Sec6-Sec9 interaction. Our analysis revealed a patch of charged and hydrophobic residues in the linker region of Sec9 that we predicted would mediate the interaction with Sec6. Mutation of these residues resulted in synthetic growth defects in combination with exocyst subunit temperature-sensitive mutations. Intriguingly, we also observed novel interactions between Sec6 and both the binary Sec9-Sso1 and ternary Sec9-Sso1-Snc2 SNARE complexes. These interactions were disrupted by the Sec9 mutation. The identification of these novel Sec6-SNARE complex interactions necessitated a revision of our previous model. We show that Sec6 does not inhibit SNARE complex assembly to the extent observed previously. These data suggest that Sec6 shares a SNARE regulatory role with other tethering complex subunits, including HOPS and COG. Mutations in recombinant proteins were generated by overlap extension PCR, cloned into the T7 expression vectors pET15b (Sec6 constructs) or pETDuet-1 (Sec9 and Sso1 constructs), and confirmed by sequencing. Full-length yeast Sec6(1–805), Sec9(414–651), and the cytosolic domain of Sso1(1–265) proteins were overexpressed in BL21(DE3) or BL21(DE3) RIL Escherichia coli cells and purified as described previously (11.Nicholson K.L.

The C-terminal domain of Sec9 is homologous to the mammalian homolog SNAP-25 and has been shown previously to be functional in yeast (6.Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V.

https://openalex.org/W1926678860,"Infectious diseases and fish feeds management are probably the major expenses in the aquaculture business. Hence, it is a priority to define sustainable strategies which simultaneously avoid therapeutic procedures and reinforce fish immunity. Currently, one preferred approach is the use of immunostimulants which can be supplemented to the fish diets. Arginine is a versatile amino acid with important mechanisms closely related to the immune response. Aiming at finding out how arginine affects the innate immune status or improve disease resistance of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) against vibriosis, fish were fed two arginine-supplemented diets (1% and 2% arginine supplementation). A third diet meeting arginine requirement level for seabass served as control diet. Following 15 or 29 days of feeding, fish were sampled for blood, spleen and gut to assess cell-mediated immune parameters and immune-related gene expression. At the same time, fish from each dietary group were challenged against Vibrio anguillarum and survival was monitored. Cell-mediated immune parameters such as the extracellular superoxide and nitric oxide decreased in fish fed arginine-supplemented diets. Interleukins and immune-cell marker transcripts were down-regulated by the highest supplementation level. Disease resistance data were in accordance with a generally depressed immune status, with increased susceptibility to vibriosis in fish fed arginine supplemented diets. Altogether, these results suggest a general inhibitory effect of arginine on the immune defences and disease resistance of European seabass. Still, further research will certainly clarify arginine immunomodulation pathways thereby allowing the validation of its potential as a prophylactic strategy."

Dietary data of 424 healthy subjects, aged 6-18 years, was collected using a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Cook et al criteria. Consumption of fast foods including hamburgers, sausages, bologna (beef), and fried potatoes was calculated and further categorized to quartiles. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate the incidence of MetS and its components in each quartile of fast food intake. The incidence of MetS was 11.3% after a 3.6 year follow up. In the fully adjusted model, compared to the lowest quartile of fast food intake, individuals in the highest had odds ratios of 2.96 (95% CI: 1.02-8.63; P for trend<0.001), 2.82 (95% CI: 1.01-7.87; P for trend = 0.037), and 2.58 (95% CI: 1.01-6.61; P for trend = 0.009) for incidence of MetS, hypertriglyceridemia, and abdominal obesity, respectively. No significant association was found between fast food intakes and other components of MetS. Fast food consumption is associated with the incidence of MetS, abdominal obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia in Tehranian children and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2234959129,"Porcelain and plastic materials constitute bulk of household wastes. Owing to resistibility and slow degradability that accounts for higher residence time, these materials qualify as potential hazardous wastes. Retention of water permits these wastes to form a congenial biotope for the breeding of different vector mosquitoes. Thus porcelain and plastic wastes pose a risk from public health viewpoint. This proposition was validated through the study on the porcelain and plastic household wastes as larval habitats of Dengue vectors (Aedes spp.) in rural and urban areas around Kolkata, India. The wastes were characterized in terms of larval productivity, seasonal variation and a comparison between urban and rural areas was made using data of two subsequent years. The number of wastes positive as larval habitats and their productivity of Aedes spp. varied among the types of household wastes with reference to months and location. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences in the larval productivity of the household wastes based on the materials, season, and urban-rural context. Results of Discriminant Analysis indicated differences in abundance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus for the urban and rural areas. The porcelain and plastic wastes were more productive in urban areas compared to the rural areas, indicating a possible difference in the household waste generation. A link between household wastes with Aedes productivity is expected to increase the risk of dengue epidemics if waste generation is continued without appropriate measures to limit addition to the environment. Perhaps, alternative strategies and replacement of materials with low persistence time can reduce this problem of waste and mosquito production."
https://openalex.org/W2287366131,"Cold-water coral (CWC) ecosystems occur worldwide and play a major role in the ocean's carbonate budget and atmospheric CO2 balance since the Danian (~65 m.y. ago). However their temporal and spatial evolution against climatic and oceanographic variability is still unclear. For the first time, we combine the main macrofaunal components of a sediment core from a CWC mound of the Melilla Mounds Field in the Eastern Alboran Sea with the associated microfauna and we highlight the importance of foraminifera and ostracods as indicators of CWC mound evolution in the paleorecord. Abundances of macrofauna along the core reveal alternating periods dominated by distinct CWC taxa (mostly Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata) that correspond to major shifts in foraminiferal and ostracod assemblages. The period dominated by M. oculata coincides with a period characterized by increased export of refractory organic matter to the seafloor and rather unstable oceanographic conditions at the benthic boundary layer with periodically decreased water energy and oxygenation, variable bottom water temperature/density and increased sediment flow. The microfaunal and geochemical data strongly suggest that M. oculata and in particular Dendrophylliidae show a higher tolerance to environmental changes than L. pertusa. Finally, we show evidence for sustained CWC growth during the Alleröd-Younger-Dryas in the Eastern Alboran Sea and that this period corresponds to stable benthic conditions with cold/dense and well oxygenated bottom waters, high fluxes of labile organic matter and relatively strong bottom currents"

Pharmacol. 2010; 643: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we aimed to determine whether bakuchiol also possessed anti-influenza virus activity. In the present study, we found that (+)-(S)-bakuchiol and (−)-(R)-bakuchiol (a synthetic enantiomer that does not occur naturally; Fig. 1A) inhibited influenza A H1N1 viral infection and growth in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and also reduced the expression of viral mRNAs and proteins. They reduced the induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) and myxovirus-resistant protein 1 (Mx1) mRNAs by the influenza A virus. (+)-(S)-Bakuchiol showed stronger antiviral activities than (−)-(R)-bakuchiol, indicating that the steric structure was important for these activities. We used an influenza A virus minigenome assay employing a Dual-Luciferase system to analyze mRNA and protein levels, and this unexpectedly revealed that bakuchiol induced host factors that inhibited firefly and Renilla luciferases. Next generation sequencing (NGS) and KeyMolnet analysis revealed an up-regulation of transcriptional regulation by the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf) pathway, and a Nrf2 reporter assay showed that (+)-(S)-bakuchiol activated Nrf2. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses showed that bakuchiol up-regulated mRNA expression of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferase A3 (GSTA3); these are Nrf2-induced oxidative stress-responsive genes. Taken together, these results indicated that bakuchiol produced novel anti-influenza effects by targeting processes involved in the host oxidative stress response. (+)-(S)-Bakuchiol and (−)-(R)-bakuchiol were chemically synthesized from geranic acid and purified using methods reported previously (19.Esumi T. Yamamoto C. Fukuyama Y. A short synthesis of (+)-bakuchiol.Synlett. 2013; 24: 1845-1847Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Their chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1A. Stock solutions (10 mm) were formed by dissolving these compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). MDCK cells were cultured in growth medium: high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Wako, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Inc.); 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies); and 4 mm l-glutamine, at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. This study used three strains of influenza A virus: Puerto Rico 8/34 (A/PR/8/34; H1N1), California 7/09 (A/CA/7/09; H1N1), and Aichi 2/68 (A/Aichi/2/68; H3N2). The viral titers were determined by immunostaining the influenza A viral nucleoprotein (NP), as described previously (26.Takahashi E. Kataoka K. Indalao I.L. Konoha K. Fujii K. Chida J. Mizuno D.

(+)-(S)-Bakuchiol or (−)-(R)-bakuchiol (0.8–100 μm in DMSO) was mixed with an influenza A virus strain (A/PR/8/34, A/CA/7/09, or A/Aichi/2/68) in the growth medium at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The mixture was added to the cells, and the treated cells were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells were fixed using 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The viable cells were then stained with a naphthol blue black solution (0.1% naphthol blue black, 0.1% sodium acetate, and 9% acetic acid) as described previously (28.Iwai Y. Murakami K. Gomi Y.

The toxicities of (+)-(S)-bakuchiol and (−)-(R)-bakuchiol toward MDCK cells were determined using an MTT cell proliferation assay kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman). Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well). Marchantin E (ME) was used as a positive control for anti-influenza viral activity (27.Shoji M. Takahashi E.

(+)-(S)-Bakuchiol, (−)-(R)-bakuchiol, or ME (12.5–100 μm) was prepared in DMSO (100 μm, 1%; 50 μm, 0.5%; 25 μm, 0.25%; 12.5 μm, 0.125%) and mixed with infection medium (DMEM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Wako, Osaka, Japan), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm l-glutamine). The mixture was added to the cells, and the treated cells were incubated for 24 or 96 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells were treated with the MTT reagent and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The wells were then treated with crystal-dissolving solution to dissolve the formazan produced by the cells, and the absorbance of each well was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. Cell viability was calculated and expressed relative to that of DMSO-treated cells, which was set as 100%. MDCK cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well). (+)-(S)-Bakuchiol, (−)-(R)-bakuchiol, or ME was mixed at a concentration of 12.5–50 μm with influenza A virus (A/PR/8/34, A/CA/7/09, or A/Aichi/2/68) at an MOI of 0.1 in the infection medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. DMSO (0.125–0.5%) was used as the negative control. Each mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C before permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. Mouse antibodies detecting the NP of A/PR/8/34 and A/Aichi/2/68 (FluA-NP 4F1, SouthernBiotech) or the NP of A/CA/7/09 (AA5H, AbD Serotec) were used as primary antibodies, as appropriate (26.Takahashi E. Kataoka K. Indalao I.L. Konoha K. Fujii K. Chida J. Mizuno D. Fujihashi K. Kido H. Oral clarithromycin enhances airway immunoglobulin A (IgA) immunity through induction of IgA class switching recombination and B-cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family molecule on mucosal dendritic cells in mice infected with influenza A virus.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 10924-10934Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (SouthernBiotech) was used as the secondary antibody. To visualize the infected cells, TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) was added and incubated for 15 min; color development was terminated by washing with H2O. The wells were photographed under a microscope, and the stained cells were counted. Each half-maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was then calculated based on the cell numbers. To explore whether bakuchiol preincubation affected viral infection, 1 × 105 MDCK cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate. (+)-(S)-Bakuchiol or (−)-(R)-bakuchiol (25 μm each) were mixed with A/PR/8/34 (MOI = 0.001) in the infection medium supplemented with 3 μg/ml l-tosylamido-2-phenyl ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. DMSO (0.5%) was the negative control, and ME (50 μm) was the positive control. Each mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 24, 48, or 72 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. To explore whether bakuchiol affected viral growth in preinfected cells, 1 × 105 MDCK cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate. The cells were infected with A/PR/8/34 (MOI = 0.001) in the infection medium for 1 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The infected cells were washed, and then (+)-(S)-bakuchiol or (−)-(R)-bakuchiol (25 μm) was added to the cells in the infection medium supplemented with 3 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. DMSO (0.5%) was the negative control, and ME (50 μm) was the positive control. The cells were then incubated for 24, 48, or 72 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cell culture media were collected from each well at the indicated time points. Serial dilutions of the conditioned media were added to naive monolayers of MDCK cells in a 96-well plate and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were immunostained using FluA-NP 4F1 (SouthernBiotech), as described above (26.Takahashi E. Kataoka K. Indalao I.L. Konoha K. Fujii K. Chida J. Mizuno D. Fujihashi K. Kido H. Oral clarithromycin enhances airway immunoglobulin A (IgA) immunity through induction of IgA class switching recombination and B-cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family molecule on mucosal dendritic cells in mice infected with influenza A virus.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 10924-10934Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the stained cells were counted. The viral titers in the conditioned media were calculated using these cell numbers (26.Takahashi E. Kataoka K. Indalao I.L. Konoha K. Fujii K. Chida J. Mizuno D. Fujihashi K. Kido H.

Virol. 2012; 86: 10924-10934Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from MDCK cell lysates using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA (500 ng) was used to synthesize cDNA using SuperScript VILO (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The synthesized cDNA was used as a template for RT-qPCR, which was performed using SYBR Green real-time PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan); each gene-specific primer employed is shown in supplemental Table 1. PCR and data analyses were performed on an Applied Biosystems StepOne Plus Real-time PCR system (Life Technologies). Relative expression was calculated by the ΔΔCt method. The levels of viral mRNAs encoding nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), NP, RNA polymerase subunits (PA, PB1, and PB2), and matrix genes (M1 and M2) were normalized to that of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (29.Kuchipudi S.V.

Chang K.C. 18S rRNA is a reliable normalisation gene for real time PCR based on influenza virus infected cells.Virol. J. 2012; 9: 230Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the levels of IFN-β, Mx1, NQO1, GSTA3, firefly luciferase, and Renilla luciferase mRNAs were normalized to that of β-actin. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. The cell lysates were then separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore). FluA-NP 4F1 (SouthernBiotech), a goat anti-influenza A viral NS1 antibody (vC-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), a rabbit anti-firefly luciferase polyclonal antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), and a rabbit anti-Renilla luciferase polyclonal antibody (MBL) were used as primary antibodies to detect their respective proteins. A rabbit anti-β-actin antibody (13E5, Cell Signaling) was used as an internal control. The secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (SouthernBiotech), donkey anti-goat IgG (sc-2020, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or goat anti-rabbit IgG (KPL), were used as appropriate. The signals were detected using Western Lightning ECL Pro (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Signal intensities were measured using ImageJ software, and the protein levels of firefly and Renilla luciferase were normalized to that of β-actin. NA assays were performed as described previously (30.Wu Z.L. Ethen C. Hickey G.E. Jiang W.

Briefly, (+)-(S)-Bakuchiol or (−)-(R)-bakuchiol (12.5–50 μm) were diluted with assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm CaCl2, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) in a 96-well black plate (Nunc, Thermo Scientific). DMSO (0.125–0.5%) was used as the negative control and oseltamivir carboxylate (9.Hiasa M. Isoda Y. Kishimoto Y. Saitoh K. Kimura Y. Kanai M. Shibasaki M. Hatakeyama D. Kirino Y. Kuzuhara T.

Two nanograms of recombinant influenza A virus H1N1 NA protein (R&D Systems) or influenza A virus (A/PR/8/34 or A/CA/7/09 at 1 × 104 pfu) in assay buffer were added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Each sample was mixed with 12.5 μm 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 96-well plate. After 0, 3, or 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2, the reaction was monitored in a fluorescence spectrometer in a kinetic mode using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 445 nm. A/PR/8/34 and A/CA/7/09 were serially diluted with PBS to achieve 0.08–10 × 104 pfu in a round-bottomed 96-well plate and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Chicken red blood cells (KOHJIN BIO, Saitama, Japan) were added to each well at a concentration of 0.5% in PBS. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plate was photographed. Next, (+)-(S)-bakuchiol or (−)-(R)-bakuchiol was diluted (0.8–100 μm) with PBS in a round-bottomed 96-well plate. DMSO (0.008–1%) was used as a negative control. A/PR/8/34 (0.63 or 0.31 × 104 pfu) or A/CA/7/09 (1.25 or 0.63 × 104 pfu) in PBS was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Each sample was mixed with 0.5% chicken red blood cells in PBS. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plates were photographed. The HA protein trypsin protection assay was performed as described previously (31.Zhu L. Li Y. Li S. Li H. Qiu Z. Lee C. Lu H. Lin X. Zhao R. Chen L. Wu J.Z. Tang G. Yang W.

We have performed a comparative analysis of the human and Drosophila Pols γ with their cognate mtSSBs, evaluating their functional relationships using a combined approach of biochemical assays and electron microscopy. We found that increasing concentrations of both mtSSBs led to the elimination of template secondary structure and gradual opening of the template DNA, through a series of visually similar template species. The stimulatory effect of mtSSB on Pol γ on these ssDNA templates is not species-specific. We observed that human mtSSB can be substituted by its Drosophila homologue, and vice versa, finding that a lower concentration of insect mtSSB promotes efficient stimulation of either Pol. Notably, distinct phases of the stimulation by both mtSSBs are distinguishable, and they are characterized by a similar organization of the template DNA for both Pols γ. We conclude that organization of the template DNA is the major factor contributing to the stimulation of Pol γ activity. Additionally, we observed that human Pol γ preferentially utilizes compacted templates, whereas the insect enzyme achieves its maximal activity on open templates, emphasizing the relative importance of template DNA organization in modulating Pol γ activity and the variation among systems.

We conclude that organization of the template DNA is the major factor contributing to the stimulation of Pol γ activity. Additionally, we observed that human Pol γ preferentially utilizes compacted templates, whereas the insect enzyme achieves its maximal activity on open templates, emphasizing the relative importance of template DNA organization in modulating Pol γ activity and the variation among systems."

These tyrosine kinases associate with heterodimeric cytokine receptors such as IL-7 receptor or IL-9 receptor, in which JAK1 is appended to the specific chain, and JAK3 is appended to the common gamma chain. Here, we studied the role of these receptor complexes in mediating the oncogenic activity of JAK3 mutants. Although JAK3V674A and the majority of other JAK3 mutants needed to bind to a functional cytokine receptor complex to constitutively activate STAT5, JAK3L857P was unexpectedly found to not depend on such receptor complexes for its activity, which was induced without receptor or JAK1 co-expression. Introducing a mutation in the FERM domain that abolished JAK-receptor interaction did not affect JAK3L857P activity, whereas it inhibited the other receptor-dependent mutants. The same cytokine receptor independence as for JAK3L857P was observed for homologous Leu857 mutations of JAK1 and JAK2 and for JAK3L875H. This different cytokine receptor requirement correlated with different functional properties in vivo and with distinct sensitivity to JAK inhibitors. Transduction of murine hematopoietic cells with JAK3V674A led homogenously to lymphoblastic leukemias in BALB/c mice. In contrast, transduction with JAK3L857P induced various types of lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. Moreover, ruxolitinib, which preferentially blocks JAK1 and JAK2, abolished the proliferation of cells transformed by the receptor-dependent JAK3V674A, yet proved much less potent on cells expressing JAK3L857P. These particular cells were, in contrast, more sensitive to JAK3-specific inhibitors. Altogether, our results showed that different JAK3 mutations induce constitutive activation through distinct mechanisms, pointing to specific therapeutic perspectives.

https://openalex.org/W2181164088,"While species fulfill many different roles in ecosystems, it has been suggested that numerous species might actually share the same function in a near neutral way. So-far, however, it is unclear whether such functional redundancy really exists. We scrutinize this question using extensive data on the world's 4168 species of diving beetles. We show that across the globe these animals have evolved towards a small number of regularly-spaced body sizes, and that locally co-existing species are either very similar in size or differ by at least 35%. Surprisingly, intermediate size differences (10-20%) are rare. As body-size strongly reflects functional aspects such as the food that these generalist predators can eat, these beetles thus form relatively distinct groups of functional look-a-likes. The striking global regularity of these patterns support the idea that a self-organizing process drives such species-rich groups to self-organize evolutionary into clusters where functional redundancy ensures resilience through an insurance effect."
https://openalex.org/W2135970464,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging, ordinarily mosquito-transmitted, alphavirus that occasionally produces hemorrhagic manifestations, such as nose bleed and bleeding gums, in human patients. Interferon response factor 3 and 7 deficient (IRF3/7-/-) mice, which are deficient for interferon α/β responses, reliably develop hemorrhagic manifestations after CHIKV infection. Here we show that infectious virus was present in the oral cavity of CHIKV infected IRF3/7-/- mice, likely due to hemorrhagic lesions in the olfactory epithelium that allow egress of infected blood into the nasal, and subsequently, oral cavities. In addition, IRF3/7-/- mice were more susceptible to infection with CHIKV via intranasal and oral routes, with IRF3/7-/- mice also able to transmit virus mouse-to-mouse without an arthropod vector. Cynomolgus macaques often show bleeding gums after CHIKV infection, and analysis of saliva from several infected monkeys also revealed the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Furthermore, saliva samples collected from several acute CHIKV patients with hemorrhagic manifestations were found to contain viral RNA and infectious virus. Oral fluids can therefore be infectious during acute CHIKV infections, likely due to hemorrhagic manifestations in the oral/nasal cavities."
https://openalex.org/W2196829420,"Goals In this clinical study, we aimed to evaluate the role of circulating microRNA-200 family as a non-invasive tool to identify patients with cirrhosis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Background Prognosis of HCC remains poor with increasing incidence worldwide, mainly related to liver cirrhosis. So far, no reliable molecular targets exist for early detection of HCC at surgically manageable stages. Recently, we identified members of the microRNA-200 family as potential diagnostic markers of cirrhosis-associated HCC in patient tissue samples. Their value as circulating biomarkers for HCC remained undefined. Methods Blood samples and clinicopathological data of consecutive patients with liver diseases were collected prospectively. Expression of the microRNA-200 family was investigated by qRT-PCR in blood serum samples of 22 HCC patients with and without cirrhosis. Serum samples of patients with non-cancerous chronic liver cirrhosis (n = 22) and of healthy volunteers (n = 15) served as controls. Results MicroRNA-141 and microRNA-200a were significantly downregulated in blood serum of patients with HCC compared to liver cirrhosis (p<0.007) and healthy controls (p<0.002). MicroRNA-141 and microRNA-200a could well discriminate patients with cirrhosis-associated HCC from healthy volunteers with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.85 and 0.82, respectively. Additionally, both microRNAs could differentiate between HCC and non-cancerous liver cirrhosis with a fair accuracy. Conclusions Circulating microRNA-200 family members are significantly deregulated in patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis. Further studies are necessary to confirm the diagnostic value of the microRNA-200 family as accurate serum marker for cirrhosis-associated HCC."

Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis ranks among the most fundamental pathways in living systems, leading to production of heme, siroheme, and vitamin B12. Synthesis of heme is conserved among all three domains of life, starting with synthesis of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), 4The abbreviations used are: ALAδ-aminolevulinic acidPIXprotoporphyrin IXMgChmagnesium chelataseMgPmagnesium protoporphyrin IXChlMMgP methyltransferase enzymeChlchlorophyllPELEProtein Energy Landscape ExplorationMgDmagnesium deuteroporphyrin IXCoPPcoproporphyrin(ogen) IIIDIXdeuteroporphyrin IX. which is converted through several enzymatic steps into protoporphyrin IX (PIX), a metal-free porphyrin ring.

The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway is more complex in photosynthetic organisms because, apart from heme, they usually require large quantities of other tetrapyrrole end products. (Bacterio)chlorophylls are critical cofactors of the photosynthetic apparatus, and cyanobacteria and red algae also produce large amounts of linear phycobilins serving for light capture in phycobilisomes. The synthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls, hemes, and bilins shares the same pathway up until PIX, at which point the ferrochelatase competes for the same substrate with magnesium chelatase (MgCh). Insertion of Mg2+ by MgCh leads to magnesium protoporphyrin IX (MgP), the first intermediate on the (bacterio)chlorophyll branch. This step is followed by methylation of MgP by MgP methyltransferase enzyme (ChlM). Tetrapyrroles are phototoxic, so their biosynthesis must be tightly regulated to prevent accumulation of intermediates. However, there are special features of this pathway in organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis (cyanobacteria, algae, and plants) that cause its regulation to be particularly important and complex. These organisms produce chlorophyll (Chl) and heme under light and in the presence of oxygen, which is a dangerous environment for dealing with high concentration of tetrapyrroles (1.Meskauskiene R. Nater M. Goslings D. Kessler F. op den Camp R. Apel K. FLU: a negative regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 373-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (8130) Google Scholar). Moreover, the relative levels of heme and Chl are quite different, and the rate of their formation depends on actual growth conditions (3.Papenbrock J. Mock H.P. Kruse E. Grimm B.

Photosynthetic cells must control the total flow through the tetrapyrrole pathway while precisely distributing PIX into heme and Chl branches. There is likely a complex regulatory network securing the synthesis of tetrapyrrole end products in required amounts while keeping the intermediate concentration extremely low (reviewed in Refs. 5.Sobotka R.

The mechanism by which this occurs, however, is far from clear. Ferrochelatase is a single-subunit enzyme but MgCh requires three subunits (ChlH, ChlI, and ChlD) for activity.

In contrast, MgCh from cyanobacteria, algae, and plants requires a protein called Gun4 that strongly enhances MgCh activity in vitro (11.Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Chory J.

Here, we employed in silico modeling, which allows us to identify the MgP-binding pocket and provides an atomic level description of the MgP-binding mechanism for cyanobacterial Gun4. Having a detailed view on interactions between Gun4 and MgP, we replaced the Trp-192 residue to obtain a Gun4 variant (W192A) with significantly weakened affinity for porphyrins. The W192A mutation was explored in vitro in a MgCh assay and in vivo in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis). These experiments revealed that the weaker affinity of W192A-Gun4 to porphyrins compromised the formation of Gun4-ChlH complex. Because the Synechocystis gun4-W192A strain was deficient in Chl precursors and exhibits a defect in accumulation of ChlH and ChlM, the porphyrin-driven interaction between Gun4-ChlH appears to be crucial for the formation and maintenance of an active MgCh enzyme. Simulations were performed with the AMBER11 molecular modeling suite (22.Case D.A. Darden T.E. Cheatham I. Simmerling C.L. Wang J. Duke R.E. Luo R. Walker R.C. Zhang W. Merz K.M. Roberts B. Wang B.

All systems were first prepared at pH 7.7 using the Protein Preparation Wizard from Schrödinger (23.Sastry G.M. Adzhigirey M. Day T. Annabhimoju R. Sherman W. Protein and ligand preparation: parameters, protocols, and influence on virtual screening enrichments.J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2013; 27: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar). The parm99 force field was used to define the parameters of the proteins in combination with a truncated octahedron water box containing ∼24,000 TIP3P water molecules. Na+ and Cl− ions were added to neutralize and reach an ionic strength of 0.15 m. After standard equilibration, we performed 200 ns of molecular dynamics at constant pressure and temperature (NPT ensemble) using the Berendsen barostat and thermostat. Root mean square fluctuation analysis was performed using the Python PRODY library, and cross-correlation maps were computed using the ptraj tool from the Ambertools 13 package. The Prime loop prediction tool (Prime, version 3.8; Schrödinger) was used to model conformations of the α2/α3 and α6/α7 loops in the Gun4 core domain. Because of the size of the loops, we used the extended loop prediction options. Side chains with less than 7.5 Å of separation were also refined, and the 10 lowest energy structures were minimized. The crystal symmetry option was used to predict the effect of crystal contacts. Dielectric constants were 1 and 80 for the (solvent-exposed) internal and external environments, respectively. PELE, a Monte Carlo algorithm developed specifically to explore protein ligand interactions (24.Borrelli K.W. Vitalis A. Alcantara R. Guallar V. PELE: Protein energy landscape exploration: a novel Monte Carlo based technique.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2005; 1: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), was used to model porphyrin binding. In PELE, each Monte Carlo step comprises two main parts: perturbation and relaxation. Perturbation consists of a random translation and rotation of the ligand plus an anisotropic network model procedure to model backbone fluctuations. Relaxation involves optimization of the side chains local to the ligand and a global minimization. Then the step is rejected or accepted using a metropolis criterion to generate a realistic distribution of the configurations generated. Entrance simulations initially placed the ligand in the bulk solvent, outside of the binding site. Using the spawning algorithms in PELE, the ligand was then directed to enter into the active site. This algorithm constrains the ligand random search within a sphere around 18 Å from a given (chosen) point. If the ligand escapes this sphere, it will be placed in the closest conformation to the reference given point found by any explorer (trajectory). The Alpha carbon in Phe-160 was used as the spawning center (representative of an active site position). PELE was able to find binding poses in ∼24 h using 48 trajectories (with 1 trajectory per computing core), using random translations and rotations in the 1–7 Å and 0–90° ranges, respectively. Once the ligand reached the active site, local refinement explorations used a smaller spawning sphere, 10 Å, and a smaller translation of 0.5 Å to better explore the binding energy profile in the bound region. A total of ∼50,000 accepted Monte Carlo steps were produced in this refinement process, requiring ∼240 trajectories, each running 24 h. To prepare Synechocystis Δgun4, we made a linear PCR construct by the method of (25.Lee J. Lee H.J. Shin M.K. Ryu W.S. Versatile PCR-mediated insertion or deletion mutagenesis.BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 398-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the Zeocin resistance cassette fused with gun4 flanking sequences (∼300 bp) to allow homologous recombination. After transformation into WT cells and segregation, the Zeocin cassette replaced almost the entire gun4 gene (bp 119–694). For the construction of the gun4-W192A strain, we cloned the chromosomal fragment containing the gun4 gene and 300-bp DNA upstream and downstream flanking regions into pUC18 vector (Life Technologies) between EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. The W192A mutation was inserted into the cloned gun4 gene using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The pUC18-gun4-W192A plasmid was transformed into the above-described Synechocystis Δgun4 strain, and photoautotrophic transformants were selected on BG11 agar plates at 28 °C and 30 μmol photons m−2 s−1. Synechocystis cells were grown in liquid culture in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks on a rotary shaker at 28 °C and bubbled with air. Absorption spectra of whole cells were measured at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-3000 spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan). Chl was extracted from cell pellets (1 ml, OD750 = ∼0.4) with 100% (v/v) methanol, and its concentration was measured spectrophotometrically according to Ref. 26.Porra R.J. Thompson W.A.

To analyze protein levels, Synechocystis cells in exponential growth phase (OD750 = ∼0.4) were harvested by centrifugation; washed; resuspended in the buffer containing 25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20% (w/v) glycerol; and broken using glass beads. Cell extracts were further denatured in 2% SDS and 1% dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature and separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel using a mini Bio-Rad system. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Sigma), probed with specific primary antibodies followed by the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The primary antibodies raised against recombinant Synechocystis Gun4 were kindly provided by Prof. Annegret Wilde (Universität Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany). To obtain recombinant Gun4 and W192A proteins, the Synechocystis gun4 gene was cloned into the pET14b plasmid and purified as for the Thermosynechococcus elongatus protein as reported previously (28.Adams N.B. Marklew C.J. Brindley A.A. Hunter C.N. Reid J.D. Characterization of the magnesium chelatase from Thermosynechococcus elongatus.Biochem.

The W192A mutation was introduced into the pET14(b):gun4 plasmid by the same procedure used for construction of the Synechocystis gun4-W192A strain (see above).

Protein was dissolved in water to a concentration of 1 mg ml−1 and analyzed in a cuvette with a 0.2-cm path length. Spectra were recorded stepwise, from 250 to 190 nm in 1-nm increments, 4 s/nm. Porphyrin-binding studies were carried out on a Jobin Yvon Fluoromax 3 spectofluorometer fitted with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder. The samples consisted of 1 μm protein in 50 mm MOPS/KOH, 11 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 m glycerol, pH 7.7, at 34 °C. Titrations were performed by the addition of porphyrin and incubated for 2 min before recording fluorescence (λex = 280 ± 4.5 nm, λem = 350 ± 18 nm). Changes in volume were <5% and were taken into account in calculating dissociation constants by using the titration mode in DynaFit 4 (Biokin Ltd.). Functional MgCh enzyme assays were performed essentially as described previously (17.Adams N.B. Marklew C.J. Qian P. Brindley A.A. Davison P.A. Bullough P.A. Hunter C.N.

Calibration curves using known standard concentrations of magnesium deuteroporphyrin IX (MgD) were created for each concentration of Gun4 analyzed. Plots of MgCh steady state activity with respect to Gun4 concentration were fitted using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics Inc) to provide apparent constants for the formation of the MgCh-Gun4 complex (Kapp). At high (8 μm) deuteroporphyrin IX (DIX) concentrations, the activity of MgCh is inhibited when Gun4 reaches high concentrations. These data were fitted to Equation 1, which allows for this observed inhibition by calculating an apparent inhibition constant (Ki app). At low concentrations of DIX (0.8 μm), no inhibition is found in the Gun4 concentration range observed; therefore Equation 2 was used to obtain estimates of complex formation. In Equations 1 and 2, νss is the observed rate of MgCh, c is the rate of MgCh in absence of Gun4, and Vmax is the theoretical maximum rate.

https://openalex.org/W1906187384,"Historical discourses about the Caribbean often chronicle West African and European influence to the general neglect of indigenous people's contributions to the contemporary region. Consequently, demographic histories of Caribbean people prior to and after European contact are not well understood. Although archeological evidence suggests that the Lesser Antilles were populated in a series of northward and eastern migratory waves, many questions remain regarding the relationship of the Caribbean migrants to other indigenous people of South and Central America and changes to the demography of indigenous communities post-European contact. To explore these issues, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome diversity in 12 unrelated individuals from the First Peoples Community in Arima, Trinidad, and 43 unrelated Garifuna individuals residing in St. Vincent. In this community-sanctioned research, we detected maternal indigenous ancestry in 42% of the participants, with the remainder having haplotypes indicative of African and South Asian maternal ancestry. Analysis of Y-chromosome variation revealed paternal indigenous American ancestry indicated by the presence of haplogroup Q-M3 in 28% of the male participants from both communities, with the remainder possessing either African or European haplogroups. This finding is the first report of indigenous American paternal ancestry among indigenous populations in this region of the Caribbean. Overall, this study illustrates the role of the region's first peoples in shaping the genetic diversity seen in contemporary Caribbean populations."
https://openalex.org/W2112388392,"Sirex noctilio F. (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) is an introduced pest of pines (Pinus spp.) in several countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Although S. noctilio is established in North America (first discovered in 2004), it has not been a destructive pest there so far, where forest communities more closely resemble those in its native Eurasian range—where it is not a pest. To investigate the influence of the existing community of associated insects (competitors + natural enemies) and fungi (vectored by insects) on S. noctilio survival in North America, we examined stage-specific mortality factors and their relative importance, generating life tables drawn from experimentally-manipulated and natural cohorts of Sirex spp. (mostly S. noctilio, but some native S. nigricornis F.). For both natural and experimentally-manipulated cohorts, factors which acted during the earliest Sirex life stages, most likely tree resistance and/or competition among fungal associates, were paramount in dictating woodwasp survival. Experimentally-manipulated life tables revealed that protection from the community of associates resulted in a significantly, and substantially larger (>15x) S. noctilio F1 generation than exposure to it. Seventy percent of generation mortality in the exposed cohort was due to tree resistance or unknown causes early in larval development, which could have included competition among other bark- or wood-inhabiting insects and/or their fungal associates. Only 46% of generation mortality in the protected cohort was due to tree resistance and/or unknown causes. Parasitoids, particularly endoparasitoids (Ibalia spp.), showed limited ability to control S. noctilio, and reduced the experimentally-established cohort by only 11%, and natural cohorts an average of 3.4%. The relative importance of tree resistance vs. competition with bark- and wood-borers in reducing S. noctilio survival remains unclear. Tree resistance and/or competition likely contribute more than natural enemies in maintaining the S. noctilio population in North America below damaging levels."

Regret intensity and regret coping were measured using validated scales. Sleep difficulties were measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and an additional question assessed the frequency of sleeping pill use. After controlling for sex, profession, years of experience, rate of employment, and depression as well as for all other regret-related variables, the following variables remained significantly associated with self-rated severity of insomnia: regret intensity (slope = 1.32, p = 0.007, 95%CI: [0.36; 2.29], std. coefficient = 0.16) and maladaptive (e.g., rumination) emotion-focused coping (slope = 1.57, p = 0.002, 95%CI: [0.60; 2.55], std. coefficient = 0.17) remained significant predictors of self-rated insomnia severity. If these cross-sectional associations represent causal effects, the development of regret-management programs may represent a promising approach to mitigating sleep difficulties of healthcare professionals."
https://openalex.org/W2221181085,"Background Urban leptospirosis has increasingly been reported in both developing and developed countries. The control of the disease is limited because our understanding of basic aspects of the epidemiology, including the transmission routes of leptospires among rat populations, remains incomplete. Through the ability to distinguish among Leptospira strains in rats, multispacer sequence typing (MST) could provide a modern understanding of Leptospira epidemiology; however, to our knowledge, the distribution of Leptospira strains among urban rat colonies has not been investigated using MST. Aims and Methodology The objective of this study was to identify the Leptospira strains present in rats (Rattus norvegicus) in Lyon (France) using MST and to characterize their spatial distribution. Kidneys and urine were collected from rats trapped live in seven locations in the city and in one suburban location. Each location was considered to represent a rat colony. Bacterial cultures and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were performed, and the L. interrogans DNA identified was then genotyped using MST. The distributions of Leptospira strains were spatially described. Key Results Among 84 wild rats, MST profiles were obtained in 35 of 37 rats that had a positive result for L. interrogans by bacterial culture and/or qPCR analyses. All of the MST profiles were related to reference strains previously isolated from human patients that belong to the serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae and the serovars [strain(s)] Copenhageni [Wijinberg or M20] (n = 26), Icterohaemorrhagiae [CHU Réunion] (n = 7), Icterohaemorrhagiae [R1] (n = 1) and Copenhageni [Shibaura 9] (n = 1). Each colony was infected with leptospires having the same MST profile. Major Conclusions This study demonstrated that MST could be used for the purpose of field studies, either on culture isolates or on DNA extracted from kidneys and urine, to distinguish among L. interrogans isolates in rats. MST could thus be used to monitor their distributions in urban rats from the same city, thereby providing new knowledge that could be applied to explore the circulation of L. interrogans infection in rat colonies. Because the strains are related to those previously found in humans, this application of MST could aid in the source tracking of human leptospirosis, and the findings would be relevant for public health purposes according to the One Health principle."
https://openalex.org/W2283768729,"Type I signal peptidase (SPase I) is an integral membrane Ser/Lys protease with one or two transmembrane domains (TMDs), cleaving transport signals off translocated precursor proteins. The catalytic domain of SPase I folds to form a hydrophobic surface and inserts into the lipid bilayers at the trans-side of the membrane. In bacteria, SPase I is targeted co-translationally, and the catalytic domain remains unfolded until it reaches the periplasm. By contrast, SPases I in eukaryotes are targeted post-translationally, requiring an alternative strategy to prevent premature folding. Here we demonstrate that two distinct stromal components are involved in post-translational transport of plastidic SPase I 1 (Plsp1) from Arabidopsis thaliana, which contains a single TMD. During import into isolated chloroplasts, Plsp1 was targeted to the membrane via a soluble intermediate in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. Insertion of Plsp1 into isolated chloroplast membranes, by contrast, was found to occur by two distinct mechanisms. The first mechanism requires ATP hydrolysis and the protein conducting channel cpSecY1 and was strongly enhanced by exogenously added cpSecA1. The second mechanism was independent of nucleoside triphosphates and proteinaceous components but with a high frequency of mis-orientation. This unassisted insertion was inhibited by urea and stroma extract. During import-chase assays using intact chloroplasts, Plsp1 was incorporated into a soluble 700-kDa complex that co-migrated with the Cpn60 complex before inserting into the membrane. The TMD within Plsp1 was required for the cpSecA1-dependent insertion but was dispensable for association with the 700-kDa complex and also for unassisted membrane insertion. These results indicate cooperation of Cpn60 and cpSecA1 for proper membrane insertion of Plsp1 by cpSecY1.

Approximately half of the proteins in an average cell are transported into or across one membrane or more to reach their final destinations (1.Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Common principles of protein translocation across membranes.Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Among the mechanisms that catalyze translocation of polypeptides across the membranes are Sec and twin-Arg translocation (Tat) pathways. Their substrates carry N-terminal transport signals, which consist of a positive n-domain followed by a hydrophobic core of 12–18 residues (h-domain) and a C-terminal domain usually ending with the Ala-Xaa-Ala motif (2.Paetzel M. Structure and mechanism of Escherichia coli type I signal peptidase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 1497-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Notably, the Tat transport signals contain the twin Arg (Arg-Arg) motif in the n-domain.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5536-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Signal cleavage is assumed to occur in or at the surface of the lipid bilayer because the h-domain of most transport signals is too short to span the membrane completely (2.Paetzel M.

This model agrees with structural and biochemical properties of the periplasmic portion of LepB without the transmembrane domains (TMDs), which was found to form a large hydrophobic surface composed of multiple β-strands (5.Paetzel M.

The chloroplast is an organelle found in photosynthetic eukaryotes and surrounded by a double-membrane envelope, housing photosynthetic electron transport in the internal membrane system known as the thylakoid. As an organelle of endosymbiotic origin, the chloroplast has its own genome. However, most proteins found in the chloroplast are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes, and targeted to the organelle post-translationally (10.Paila Y.D. Richardson L.G.

Biol. 2015; 427: 1038-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Specific chloroplast targeting is usually ensured by an N-terminal extension called transit peptide, which is cleaved in the stroma (11.Inoue K. Glaser E. Theg S.M. Wollman F.-A.

Four pathways are known to target proteins from the stroma to thylakoids: the three pathways homologous to bacterial Sec, Tat, and SRP pathways, respectively, and the chloroplast-specific unassisted pathway for a subset of proteins that spontaneously insert into the membrane (13.Dabney-Smith C.

All known chloroplast Sec1 (cpSec1) and Tat (cpTat) substrates, except for the Rieske iron/sulfur subunit of cytochrome b6f complexes (ISP), and all known unassisted pathway substrates with a single TMD carry an N-terminal transport signal. Removal of this signal, called cleavable thylakoid-transfer signal (cTTS), is catalyzed by a LepB homolog known as thylakoidal processing peptidase in the lumen (11.Inoue K. Glaser E. Theg S.M.

Targeting of lumenal proteins across the thylakoid membrane.J. Exp. Bot. 2012; 63: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ISP is an unusual cpTat substrate in that it carries an uncleavable TTS, which appears to act as a membrane anchor, and contains Lys-Arg, instead of Arg-Arg, in the n-domain (16.Molik S.

In land plants, thylakoidal processing peptidase is encoded in the nucleus by a small gene family called plastidic SPase I 1 and 2 (Plsp1 and 2) (18.Hsu S.C. Endow J.K. Ruppel N.J. Roston R.L. Baldwin A.J. Inoue K. Functional diversification of thylakoidal processing peptidases in Arabidopsis thaliana.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e27258Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Plsp1 is predicted to span the membrane once and face a large C terminus including the catalytic site into the thylakoid lumen (19.Shipman R.L. Inoue K. Suborganellar localization of plastidic type I signal peptidase 1 depends on chloroplast development.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Its lumenal domain shows a high sequence similarity to the periplasmic domain of LepB (20.Midorikawa T. Endow J.K. Dufour J. Zhu J. Inoue K.

Genetic and biochemical data have demonstrated that Plsp1 is the main thylakoidal processing peptidase isoform in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana and is required for proper thylakoid development (20.Midorikawa T.

Interestingly, Plsp1 is present not only in thylakoids but also in the envelope membrane where it cleaves the envelope-targeting sequence off the precursor of an outer membrane protein Toc75 (19.Shipman R.L.

Localization of Plsp1 correlates with the abundance of membranes, shifting from the envelope to thylakoids as chloroplasts develop (19.Shipman R.L. Inoue K. Suborganellar localization of plastidic type I signal peptidase 1 depends on chloroplast development.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we have used various assays to elucidate the mechanism of Plsp1 transport. Available systems have not allowed us to define the mechanism of envelope targeting. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that Plsp1 is imported into the chloroplast stroma using an N-terminal extension and sorted to thylakoids by the cpSec1 pathway, even though it lacks a cTTS. Our data also show that the lumenal portion of Plsp1 can spontaneously insert into the membrane from the cis-side, but this nonspecific event is prevented by integration into a large complex in the stroma that co-migrates with a chaperonin-60 (Cpn60) complex. These results represent an evolutionary adaptation from the ribosome-dependent co-translational insertion to the chaperone-dependent post-translational transport of SPase I. Two sets of DNA constructs were prepared using oligonucleotide primers listed in Table 1. The first set was used for in vitro transcription/translation to generate radiolabeled precursors for transport assays. Coding sequences for prPlsp1 and Plsp1Δ2–67 (21.Inoue K. Baldwin A.J.

Keegstra K. A polyglycine stretch is necessary for proper targeting of the protein translocation channel precursor to the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts.Plant J. 2003; 34: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Chloroplast membranes and stroma extract were prepared as described (30.Rodrigues R.A. Silva-Filho M.C. Cline K. FtsH2 and FtsH5: two homologous subunits use different integration mechanisms leading to the same thylakoid multimeric complex.Plant J. 2011; 65: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, after precipitating by centrifugation at 1,000 × g, 4 °C for 6 min, intact chloroplasts were resuspended with a hypotonic lysis buffer (HM buffer: 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, and 10 mm MgCl2) to 1 mg/ml chlorophyll on ice in dark for 10 min. The lysed chloroplasts were centrifuged at 3,200 × g, 4 °C for 8 min, yielding the crude stroma and pellet fractions. The obtained pellet fraction was further resuspended in HM buffer and centrifuged at 3,200 × g, 4 °C for 8 min, yielding the crude membrane fraction. To prepare stroma extract (SE), the crude stroma fraction was diluted with an equal volume of 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 660 mm sorbitol, and 10 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 42,000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min. An aliquot (95%) of the obtained supernatant was concentrated to 5-fold using an Amicon Ultra-4 30000 NMWL column (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). To prepare chloroplast membranes for transport assays, the crude membrane fraction was resuspended in HM buffer to ∼0.25 mg/ml chlorophyll and centrifuged at 3,200 × g, 4 °C for 8 min. The obtained pellet was resuspended to 1 mg/ml chlorophyll in IB containing 10 mm MgCl2 (IBM). Protein import assays using isolated chloroplasts was performed as described previously (29.Inoue K. Keegstra K. A polyglycine stretch is necessary for proper targeting of the protein translocation channel precursor to the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts.Plant J. 2003; 34: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After import, intact chloroplasts were reisolated through a 40% Percoll cushion and resuspended in IB. An aliquot was used to quantify the amount of chlorophyll as described (31.Arnon D.I. Copper enzymes in isolated chloroplasts: polyphenoloxidase in Beta vulgaris.Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other aliquots were centrifuged to yield chloroplast pellet, which was resuspended to 0.2 mg/ml chlorophyll of 1 × SDS-PAGE sample loading solution. For import time course experiments, the reactions with different incubation times were staggered so that all reactions would be terminated at the same time and processed together. For import-chase assays, after 10-min import in the light, the chloroplasts were pelleted at 900 × g and 4 °C for 3 min and resuspended with IB containing 0.5 mg/ml thermolysin and 10 mm CaCl2 and then incubated on ice in the dark for 30 min. The thermolysin activity was quenched with one volume of IB containing 20 mm EDTA. Intact chloroplasts were then reisolated through a 1 ml of 40% Percoll cushion in IB containing 50 mm EDTA, resuspended in IB containing 5 mm EDTA, and aliquoted into multiple tubes. Each sample was then centrifuged, and the resultant pellets were resuspended with IB containing one of the following five sets of chemicals: (i) 3 mm MgCl2 and 3 mm LiCl (blank), (ii) 3 mm MgATP and 3 mm LiCl (ATP), (iii) 3 mm Li-AMP-PNP and 3 mm MgCl2 (AMP-PNP), (iv) 10 mm NaN3, 3 mm MgCl2 and 3 mm LiCl (NaN3), and (v) 1.5 μm nigericin, 1.5 μm valinomycin, 3 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm LiCl (N/V). The reaction was further incubated under import conditions for the specified time, and then intact chloroplasts were reisolated through Percoll cushions and analyzed as above. For analysis of the soluble mPlsp1 complex by BN-PAGE, radiolabeled prPlsp1 was imported into intact chloroplasts in the light with 3 mm MgATP for 10 min. Chloroplasts reisolated through Percoll cushions were lysed with HM buffer and incubated for 5 min in the dark on ice. The mixture was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min. The obtained supernatant was centrifuged again, and the resultant soluble fraction was subjected to various treatments or directly added to 1 × BN-PAGE buffer and analyzed by BN-PAGE as described previously (24.Endow J.K. Inoue K. Stable complex formation of thylakoidal processing peptidase and PGRL1.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587: 2226-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Protein transport into isolated chloroplast membranes was performed as described previously (30.Rodrigues R.A. Silva-Filho M.C. Cline K. FtsH2 and FtsH5: two homologous subunits use different integration mechanisms leading to the same thylakoid multimeric complex.Plant J. 2011; 65: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, each reaction (72 μl) contained chloroplast membranes equivalent to 24 μg of chlorophyll and 5 mm MgATP in IBM. Where indicated, concentrated stroma (24 μl) was also included in the mixture. The reaction was performed at room temperature for 30 min in the dark or in the light, followed by centrifugation at 3,200 × g, 4 °C for 8 min. The obtained pellet was resuspended with 120 μl of IB, and 6 μl of 2 mg/ml thermolysin in IB containing 10 mm CaCl2 was added. After incubation on ice in the dark for 40 min, the thermolysin activity was quenched with one volume IB containing 14 mm EDTA and then centrifuged at 3,200 × g, 4 °C for 8 min. The pellet was washed with IB containing 5 mm EDTA and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Trypsin pretreatment of isolated chloroplast membranes was performed as previously described (32.Thompson S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. Dual signal peptides mediate the signal recognition particle/Sec-independent insertion of a thylakoid membrane polyprotein, PsbY.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4059-4066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes were resuspended to 50 μg/ml chlorophyll with HM buffer without or with trypsin (60 μg/ml) and incubated on ice in the dark for 10 min, followed by the addition of one volume of 0.6 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor in HM buffer. The chloroplast membranes were then recovered as a pellet after centrifugation and washed with 0.12 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor in HM buffer. The resultant membranes were further washed with IBM, resuspended to 1 mg/ml chlorophyll with IBM, and used in transport experiments as above. Antibody inhibition experiments were performed as described (30.Rodrigues R.A. Silva-Filho M.C. Cline K. FtsH2 and FtsH5: two homologous subunits use different integration mechanisms leading to the same thylakoid multimeric complex.Plant J. 2011; 65: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). When the effect of cpSecA1 was tested, the control reaction was supplemented with 3 mm NaH2PO4, 19 mm NaCl, and 16 mm imidazole. Intensity of radioactive signals from bands on gels was quantified using ImageJ 1.48v (National Institutes of Health). For the import time course and import-chase assays, the signals for each repetition of the experiment were normalized to the mean of signals for all of the time points or treatments for the total chloroplast fraction. These normalized values were adjusted to the mean of the normalized signals at the 30-min time point for the import time course or the mean of all of the signals in the total chloroplast fractions for the import-chase experiments. For the membrane transport experiments, the signals were adjusted to the mean within each repetition for each substrate. The normalized signals were then adjusted to the mean signals of the untreated transport reaction with ATP and SE for the repetitions for each substrate, except for sets of transports including His10-Plsp1Δ1–134, where they were adjusted to the untreated transport reaction without SE. Statistical analyses were performed with R, version 3.1.2. The Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) groupings were found for the inhibitor treatment, the interaction between SE and inhibitor treatment, and the interaction between SE, inhibitors, and cpSecA1 using Tukey HSD test of the agricolae package, version 1.1–9 with α = 0.05. Production of His6-tagged cpSecA1 was performed using BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus-RIL cells (Agilent Technologies). An aliquot of overnight culture (15 ml) was added to 300 ml of lysogeny broth containing 25 mg/liter kanamycin and 12.5 mg/liter chloramphenicol and grown further at 37 °C and 220 rpm until it reached an A600 of ∼0.6. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were incubated at 28 °C and 220 rpm for 4 h and pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. The recovered cells were resuspended with buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 200 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, lysozyme added to 1 mg/liter and were further incubated on ice for 30 min. They were then sonicated and centrifuged at 11,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. Recombinant cpSecA1 was purified from the resultant supernatant using Ni-NTA-agarose and eluted with buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 200 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, under the native conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). His10-tagged Plsp1 variants were prepared as described (17.Madueño F. Bradshaw S.A. Gray J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2286847415,"Upon translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, secretory proteins are proteolytically processed to remove their signal peptide by signal peptidase (SPase). This process is critical for subsequent folding, intracellular trafficking, and maturation of secretory proteins. Prokaryotic SPase has been shown to be a promising antibiotic target. In contrast, to date, no eukaryotic SPase inhibitors have been reported. Here we report that introducing a proline immediately following the natural signal peptide cleavage site not only blocks preprotein cleavage but also, in trans, impairs the processing and maturation of co-expressed preproteins in the ER. Specifically, we find that a variant preproinsulin, pPI-F25P, is translocated across the ER membrane, where it binds to the catalytic SPase subunit SEC11A, inhibiting SPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Similar findings were obtained with an analogous variant of preproparathyroid hormone, demonstrating that inhibition of the SPase does not depend strictly on the sequence or structure of the downstream mature protein. We further show that inhibiting SPase in the ER impairs intracellular processing of viral polypeptides and their subsequent maturation. These observations suggest that eukaryotic SPases (including the human ortholog) are, in principle, suitable therapeutic targets for antiviral drug design.

In this article, we report that variants of preproinsulin or preproparathyroid hormone (preProPTH), designed to contain a proline substitution at the +1 (P1′) position relative to the SP cleavage site, bind to the catalytic subunits of human SPase and inhibit its activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the variant preproinsulin inhibits intracellular processing of a viral structural protein (derived from HCV) and a protein that regulates the export and translation of mRNA (Rem, derived from MMTV). Therefore, expressing secretory proteins containing (P1′) proline mutations not only provides a useful tool to study the intracellular consequences of defective SP processing in mammalian cells but also creates a rationale for targeting SPase in antiviral therapy.

Mutant INS-gene induced diabetes of youth: proinsulin cysteine residues impose dominant-negative inhibition on wild-type proinsulin transport.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e13333Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All resulting plasmids were confirmed by direct sequencing. The plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged human WT prepro-opiomelanocortin (prePOMC) was a gift from Drs. Anna Maria Di Blasio and Monica Mencarelli (Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Italy). The plasmid encoding Myc-tagged MMTV Rem protein was a gift from Dr. Katja Kapp (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Germany). The HCV structural proteins core, E1, and E2 were subcloned from the J6 genotype 2a HCV strain (25.Yanagi M. Purcell R.H. Emerson S.U. Bukh J.

HEK293T cells plated onto 12-well plates 1 day before transfection were transfected with 1–2 μg of plasmids encoding WT or mutant preproteins with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 15 min, with or without chase as indicated. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The cell lysates and chase medium were precleared with zysorbin for 1 h, subjected to IP with the appropriate antibodies, and analyzed by NuPage or Tris-Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE as described previously (27.Liu M.

For co-IP, the cells were lysed with co-IP buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were split in half. One half was subjected to IP with anti-insulin, and another half was subjected to co-IP with anti-FLAG followed by analysis using NuPage. The bands were detected on a PhosphorImager and quantified using National Institutes of Health ImageJ. For Western blotting, 10–20 μg of total protein lysates was boiled in SDS sample buffer with or without 100 mm DTT, resolved by 4–12% NuPage, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blotted with the appropriate primary antibodies and then with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP, followed with development by ECL. For quantification of the mRNA levels of HCV structural proteins in transfected HEK293T cells, 48 h after transfection, the total RNA was isolated and used for synthesizing cDNA, followed by quantitative real-time PCR using the forward primer 5′ GCGCCTCACCAGCTTATTTG and the reverse primer 5′ ATAAAGCCGGTGTGCAAGGA. Sodium carbonate extraction was performed as described previously (28.Guo H. Xiong Y. Witkowski P. Cui J. Wang L.J. Sun J. Lara-Lemus R. Haataja L. Hutchison K. Shan S.O. Arvan P. Liu M.

Briefly, 48 h post-transfection, HEK293T cells were suspended in 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 12), homogenized, and incubated on ice for 1 h, followed by sedimentation at 50,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatants and pellets were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Paired, two-tailed Student's t tests were used to compare two samples. Analysis of variance was performed to compare multiple samples. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. From a database of 1877 eukaryotic secretory protein SPs (29.Choo K. Ranganathan S. Flanking signal and mature peptide residues influence signal peptide cleavage.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: S15Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we analyzed the frequency of specific amino acid residues at the P1′ position. From this analysis, we observed that alanine occurred most frequently at the P1′ position, whereas proline is at least 50-fold less common at this location (Fig. 1A). To examine the efficiency of SP cleavage with different residues at P1′, we exploited a dozen different human preproinsulin mutants, replacing the phenylalanine at this position (Fig. 1B). Each construct was expressed individually in 293T cells, and the SP cleavage efficiency of newly synthesized mutant preproinsulin was analyzed. A well known diabetes-causing mutant in the P1 rather than in the P1′ position was used as a positive control for unprocessed preproinsulin (26.Land A. Zonneveld D. Braakman I. Folding of HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein involves extensive isomerization of disulfide bonds and conformation-dependent leader peptide cleavage.FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1058-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although a threonine substitution at P1′ of the M13 procoat protein has been reported to interfere with SP cleavage by bacterial SPase I (31.Shen L.M. Lee J.I. Cheng S.Y. Jutte H. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. Use of site-directed mutagenesis to define the limits of sequence variation tolerated for processing of the M13 procoat protein by the Escherichia coli leader peptidase.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11775-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), pPI with a Thr substitution at P1′ was processed comparably with that of other functional residues (Fig. 1C). However, a proline substitution inhibited SP processing of pPI-F25P to proinsulin (Fig. 1C). By contrast, neither pPI-V26P nor pPI-N27P inhibited SP processing of preproinsulin (Fig. 1C, right panel), indicating that the inhibitory effect of Pro was limited to the P1′ position. Impaired processing of pPI-F25P, shown in Fig. 1C, could represent either a cleavage defect or a defect of targeting/translocation across the ER membrane (31.Shen L.M. Lee J.I. Cheng S.Y. Jutte H. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. Use of site-directed mutagenesis to define the limits of sequence variation tolerated for processing of the M13 procoat protein by the Escherichia coli leader peptidase.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11775-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An earlier study showed that the M13 procoat protein with a proline substitution at the P1′ position failed to translocate across the cytoplasmic membrane. We therefore utilized two independent approaches to examine whether pPI-F25P was translocated into the ER lumen. First, we analyzed preproinsulin disulfide bond formation, which occurs in the oxidizing environment of the ER lumen, using Tris-Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE under nonreducing and reducing conditions (27.Liu M. Li Y. Cavener D. Arvan P. Proinsulin disulfide maturation and misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13209-13212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33.Sun J. Cui J. He Q. Chen Z. Arvan P. Liu M. Proinsulin misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum stress during the development and progression of diabetes.Mol. Aspects Med. 2015; 42: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Proinsulin WT and pPI-A24D, both of which are translocated into the ER lumen (26.Land A. Zonneveld D. Braakman I. Folding of HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein involves extensive isomerization of disulfide bonds and conformation-dependent leader peptide cleavage.FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1058-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), were used as positive controls of oxidative folding. As shown in Fig. 2A, during a 15-min metabolic labeling, pPI-F25P underwent rapid oxidative folding, similar to pPI-A24D. Second, we introduced a predicted N-linked glycosylation site at the 74th position of pPI-F25P, generating the double mutant pPI-F25P/A74N. Indeed, both newly synthesized pPI-A24D/A74N and pPI-F25P/A74N were glycosylated, as confirmed by mobility shift after deglycosylation with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that at least 76 residues of newly synthesized pPI-F25P were accessible on the lumenal side of the ER membrane. Together, the results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that a P1′ Pro substitution does not interfere with the translocation of nascent preproinsulin across the ER membrane. To examine the fate of uncleaved pPI-F25P, we performed pulse-chase experiments and found that 2Myc-tagged pPI-WT folded and trafficked normally in cells (data not shown). However, both 2Myc-tagged pPI-A24D and pPI-F25P mutants failed to be secreted from cells after a 2-h chase (Fig. 2C). Remarkably, pPI-F25P, but not pPI-A24D, could also impair the SP cleavage of co-expressed preproinsulin-WT (Fig. 2C, lane 14). The unprocessed preproinsulin-WT was partially degraded during a subsequent 2-h chase but without evidence of further processing to proinsulin (Fig. 2C, lanes 15 and 16). To examine whether pPI-F25P affects the translocation of preproinsulin-WT, we co-expressed pPI-F25P with pPI-A74N and found that almost all of the pPI-A74N became glycosylated, although the SP remained unprocessed, as confirmed by deglycosylation with PNGase F (Fig. 3A, solid and open arrows indicate glyco-pPI and preproinsulin, respectively). Therefore, pPI-F25P inhibits SP cleavage of co-expressed preproinsulin-WT but does not affect its translocation. Next we co-expressed a fixed amount of pPI-WT with increasing amounts of pPI-F25P in HEK293T cells. We found that the SP cleavage defect of preproinsulin-WT became increasingly severe as the amount of pPI-F25P was increased (Fig. 3B, quantified in C), indicating dose-dependent inhibition of preproinsulin-WT SP cleavage in trans by pPI-F25P. To establish competitive inhibition of pPI-F25P on SPase, we co-expressed a fixed amount of pPI-F25P with an increasing amount of preproinsulin-WT and found that the ratio of proinsulin/preproinsulin increased gradually (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of pPI-F25P can be overcome by an increased concentration of preproinsulin-WT substrate. These data indicate that pPI-F25P acts as a competitive inhibitor of SPase. First, we asked whether pPI-F25P could inhibit SP processing of other secretory preproteins provided that they share the same preproinsulin signal sequence. We constructed a fusion protein in which the insulin SP (ISP) was fused with a Myc-tagged pro-islet amyloid polypeptide (ProIAPP) (named ISP-ProIAPP-Myc; Fig. 4A, top panel). When this fusion protein was co-expressed with pPI-F25P, excision of its SP was inhibited (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, we examined the effect of pPI-F25P on SP cleavage of preproteins that do not share the same signal sequence. Indeed, pPI-F25P inhibited SP cleavage of all tested secretory proteins, including the small unglycosylated secretory proteins preProIAPP (Fig. 4, C and D) and preProPTH (Fig. 4, E and F) as well as the relatively large secretory glycoprotein prePOMC (Fig. 4G), and GFP fused with insulin SP in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Because proline is the least favored residue at the P1′ position (Fig. 1A), we asked whether other secretory proteins bearing Pro at the P1′ position also inhibit SPase. Indeed, preProPTH-K26P was also uncleaved in 293T cells (Fig. 5A; the preProPTH-C18R hypoparathyroidism-causing mutant (34.Datta R. Waheed A. Shah G.N. Sly W.S. Signal sequence mutation in autosomal dominant form of hypoparathyroidism induces apoptosis that is corrected by a chemical chaperone.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19989-19994Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) served as a positive control for uncleaved preProPTH). In addition, preProPTH-K26P in trans also impaired SP cleavage of co-expressed preproinsulin-WT (Fig. 5B, quantified in C). Together, these results suggest that preproteins with a Pro at the P1′ position (e.g. pPI-F25P and preProPTH-K26P) may be used as general SPase inhibitors, impairing SP processing and intracellular trafficking of secretory proteins. Upon translocation across the ER membrane, pPI-F25P can either remain associated with the ER membrane or be released freely into the ER lumen. To examine this, we transfected Myc-tagged pPI-F25P into HEK293T cells and performed a sodium carbonate wash to separate integral membrane proteins from lumenal and peripheral membrane proteins (35.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. Isolation of intracellular membranes by means of sodium carbonate treatment: application to endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). At steady state, ∼30% of pPI-F25P molecules were processed to proinsulin that was fully extracted (in parallel with binding immunoglobulin protein, an ER-lumenal protein control). In addition, a small fraction of uncleaved pPI-F25P that might be more weakly associated with the ER membrane or released gradually to the ER lumen was also extracted by carbonate. However, the majority of uncleaved pPI-F25P molecules was not extracted and was recovered from the membrane fraction in parallel with calnexin, an ER-integral membrane protein control (Fig. 6A). All five subunits of SPase are integral membrane proteins with different membrane topologies (36.Shelness G.S. Lin L. Nicchitta C.V. Membrane topology and biogenesis of eukaryotic signal peptidase.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5201-5208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Kalies K.-U. Hartmann E.

Because the majority of uncleaved pPI-F25P is anchored in the ER membrane, we asked whether the inhibitory effect of pPI-F25P depended on its topology. We have reported recently that a positive charge in the N region and charge gradient flanking the H region of SP plays a critical role in orienting the SP of preproinsulin during translocation. Indeed, two SP mutations, pPI-R6C and pPI-R6C/D20R, cause ∼50% and ∼90%, respectively, of preproinsulin to become misoriented in the ER membrane during translocation (28.Guo H. Xiong Y. Witkowski P. Cui J. Wang L.J. Sun J. Lara-Lemus R. Haataja L. Hutchison K. Shan S.O. Arvan P. Liu M. Inefficient translocation of preproinsulin contributes to pancreatic β cell failure and late-onset diabetes.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 16290-16302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore introduced F25P into pPI-R6C or pPI-R6C/D20R, generating double and triple mutants, respectively (Fig. 6B). When pPI-R6C/F25P was co-expressed with preproinsulin-WT, its inhibitory effect on the SP cleavage of preproinsulin-WT was decreased significantly (Fig. 6C, quantified in E) compared with that of pPI-F25P, and the inhibitory effect was decreased further in the triple mutant pPI-R6C/D20R/F25P (Fig. 6D, quantified in E). These results suggest that pPI-F25P exerts its inhibitory effect on the lumenal side of the ER membrane and that the inhibition requires a specific orientation of its SP. Among the five subunits of the SPases, SEC11A and SEC11C are thought to be catalytic subunits of the enzyme (9.Walker S.J. Lively M.O. Rawlings N.D. Salvesen G. Academic Press, Washington, D. C2013: 3512-3517Google Scholar). To examine whether pPI-F25P inhibits SPase by binding to the catalytic subunits, we co-expressed Myc-tagged pPI-F25P with the FLAG-tagged subunits SEC11A or SPCS1. The interactions of Myc-tagged pPI-F25P with SPase subunits were analyzed using co-immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. Neither preproinsulin-WT nor pPI-F25P was pulled down by SPCS1 (Fig. 7). However, pPI-F25P was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with SEC11A (Fig. 7), and similar results were obtained with SEC11C (data not shown), suggesting that pPI-F25P inhibits SPase activity by binding to catalytic subunits of the en"

Methods This is a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, Cape Town, South Africa conducted in 2009/2010. The study sample included 1220 participants (77.2% women) aged 35–70 years, for whom anthropometric measurements were obtained and risk factors documented through face-to-face interviews using validated international PURE study protocols. Sex-specific logistic regression models were used to evaluate socio-demographic, lifestyle and psychological factors associated with three excessive body fat indicators, namely body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and body fat percent (BF%). Results The prevalence of excessive body fat based on BF%, WC and BMI cut-offs were 96.0%, 86.1%, and 81.6% for women respectively, and 62.2%, 25.9%, and 36.0% for men respectively. The significant odds of excessive body fat among the currently married compared to unmarried were 4.1 (95% CI: 1.3–12.5) for BF% and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3–2.9) for BMI among women; and 4.9 (95% CI: 2.6–9.6), 3.2 (95% CI: 1.6–6.4) and 3.6 (95% CI: 1.9–6.8) for BF%, WC and BMI respectively among men. Age ≤50 years (compared to age >50 years) was inversely associated with excessive BF% in men and women, and less-than-a-college education was inversely associated with excessive BMI and WC in men. Tobacco smoking was inversely associated with all three excessive adiposity indicators in women but not in men. Unemployment, depression, and stress did not predict excessive body fat in men or women. Conclusion The sex-differences in the socio-demographic and lifestyle factors associated with the high levels of excessive body fat in urban and rural women and men should be considered in packaging interventions to reduce obesity in these communities."

https://openalex.org/W2111719412,"Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains a major public health issue and research has shown that large regional variation in outcomes exists. Of the interventions associated with survival, the provision of bystander CPR is one of the most important modifiable factors. The aim of this study is to identify census areas with high incidence of OHCA and low rates of bystander CPR in Victoria, Australia.We conducted an observational study using prospectively collected population-based OHCA data from the state of Victoria in Australia. Using ArcGIS (ArcMap 10.0), we linked the location of the arrest using the dispatch coordinates (longitude and latitude) to Victorian Local Government Areas (LGAs). We used Bayesian hierarchical models with random effects on each LGA to provide shrunken estimates of the rates of bystander CPR and the incidence rates.Over the study period there were 31,019 adult OHCA attended, of which 21,436 (69.1%) cases were of presumed cardiac etiology. Significant variation in the incidence of OHCA among LGAs was observed. There was a 3 fold difference in the incidence rate between the lowest and highest LGAs, ranging from 38.5 to 115.1 cases per 100,000 person-years. The overall rate of bystander CPR for bystander witnessed OHCAs was 62.4%, with the rate increasing from 56.4% in 2008-2010 to 68.6% in 2010-2013. There was a 25.1% absolute difference in bystander CPR rates between the highest and lowest LGAs.Significant regional variation in OHCA incidence and bystander CPR rates exists throughout Victoria. Regions with high incidence and low bystander CPR participation can be identified and would make suitable targets for interventions to improve CPR participation rates."
https://openalex.org/W2208945110,"We examine depth perception in images of real scenes with naturalistic variation in pictorial depth cues, simulated dioptric blur and binocular disparity. Light field photographs of natural scenes were taken with a Lytro plenoptic camera that simultaneously captures images at up to 12 focal planes. When accommodation at any given plane was simulated, the corresponding defocus blur at other depth planes was extracted from the stack of focal plane images. Depth information from pictorial cues, relative blur and stereoscopic disparity was separately introduced into the images. In 2AFC tasks, observers were required to indicate which of two patches extracted from these images was farther. Depth discrimination sensitivity was highest when geometric and stereoscopic disparity cues were both present. Blur cues impaired sensitivity by reducing the contrast of geometric information at high spatial frequencies. While simulated generic blur may not assist depth perception, it remains possible that dioptric blur from the optics of an observer’s own eyes may be used to recover depth information on an individual basis. The implications of our findings for virtual reality rendering technology are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2209537520,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cleaved products have been reported to have important functions in CNS health, including in memory and synapse formation, cell survival and neuroprotection. Furthermore APP and its cleaved products have been shown to be transiently increased in response to various CNS stressors, suggesting a role in response to acute cellular injury. In an attempt to further understand the function of APP in response to CNS injury, we have used intracranial LPS injection as an inflammatory injury model in APP knock out mice (APPKO). Our data show that innate immune responses to LPS injection is significantly blunted in APPKO mice compared to APP sufficient wild type (BL6) mice. Morphologically, glial cells in APPKO mice appear less reactive, with shorter ramified processes and smaller cell bodies in response to LPS. Additionally, quantitative RT-PCR analysis for several glia markers and innate immune cytokine levels (e.g. TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-10) showed significantly reduced expression levels in LPS injected APPKO mice. In vitro cell culture assays confirmed this attenuated response to LPS stimulation by primary microglial cells isolated from APPKO mice. Our data suggests that APP full length protein and/or its cleaved products are necessary to mount a complete and effective innate immune cell response to inflammatory injury."
https://openalex.org/W2221223304,"The ovary is an important site where gene variants modulate pubertal timing. The cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is expressed in the ovary, plays a role in folliculogenesis and ovulation, and can be modulated by estrogens. Obesity is strictly associated with early menarche and is characterized by sex hormone and endocannabinoid derangement.In this study, we investigated the role of the CB2 receptor in determining the age at menarche in obese girls.We studied a cohort of 240 obese girls (age 11.9±3 years; BMI z-score 2.8±0.8). The age at menarche (if it had already occurred) was recorded at the time of the visit or via phonecall. The CNR2 rs35761398 polymorphism, which leads to the CB2 Q63R variant, was detected by the TaqMan assay.In total, 105 patients were homozygous for the R63-coding allele (RR), 113 were QR and 22 were QQ. Variance analysis revealed a significantly earlier age of menarche in subjects carrying the Q63 allele, which was also found after adjusting for BMI z-score (11±1.2 vs. 11.6±1.2 years, p = 0.0003). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that patients homozygous for the Q allele had a 2.2-fold higher risk (odds ratio = 2.2; CI1.1-3.4; p = 0.02) of presenting with an early menarche (age at menarche <12 years).We demonstrated for the first time the association between the CB2 Q63R functional variant and the age at menarche in a cohort of Italian obese girls."
https://openalex.org/W2338439678,"Sensing and responding to endogenous electrical fields are important abilities for cells engaged in processes such as embryogenesis, regeneration and wound healing. Many types of cultured cells have been induced to migrate directionally within electrical fields in vitro using a process known as galvanotaxis. The underlying mechanism by which cells sense electrical fields is unknown. In this study, we assembled a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) galvanotaxis system and found that mouse fibroblasts and human prostate cancer PC3 cells migrated to the cathode. By comparing the effects of a pulsed direct current, a constant direct current and an anion-exchange membrane on the directed migration of mouse fibroblasts, we found that these cells responded to the ionic flow in the electrical fields. Taken together, the observed effects of the calcium content of the medium, the function of the store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) and the intracellular calcium content on galvanotaxis indicated that calcium ionic flow from the anode to the cathode within the culture medium permeated the cells through SOCs at the drift velocity, promoting migration toward the cathode. The RTK-PI3K pathway was involved in this process, but the ROCK and MAPK pathways were not. PC3 cells and mouse fibroblasts utilized the same mechanism of galvanotaxis. Together, these results indicated that the signaling pathway responsible for cathode-directed cellular galvanotaxis involved calcium ionic flow from the anode to the cathode within the culture medium, which permeated the cells through SOCs, causing cytoskeletal reorganization via PI3K signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2188762270,"Obesity is a worldwide epidemic with more than 600 million affected individuals. Human studies have demonstrated some alterations in brains of otherwise healthy obese individuals and elevated risk of neurodegenerative disease of old age; these studies have also pointed to slightly diminished memory and executive functions among healthy obese individuals. Similar findings were obtained in animal models of obesity induced by high fat diet. On the other hand, low carbohydrate high fat diets are currently promoted for losing weight (e.g., Atkin's style diets). However, the long-term effects of such diets are not known. Additionally, high fat diets leading to (mild) ketonemia were shown to improve brain function in elderly humans and in some animal models.To evaluate the hypothesis that long-term use of a high fat diet was associated with decreases in spatial memory, smaller hippocampi and hippocampi metabolite concentrations in Wistar rats.Twenty five male Wistar rats were put on high fat diet (HFD; 60% calories from fat, 30% from carbohydrates) on their 55th day of life, while 25 control male rats (CONs) remained on chow. Adequate levels of essential nutrients were provided. Both groups underwent memory tests in 8-arm radial maze at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th month. 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed to measure concentrations of tNAA (marker of neuronal integrity) at one month and one year, whereas MRI was used to evaluate hippocampal volumes.Obese rats (OBRs) consumed similar amount of calories as CONs, but less proteins. However, their protein intake was within recommended amounts. Throughout the experiment OBRs had statistically higher concentrations of blood ketone bodies than CONs, but still within normal values. At post-mortem assessment, OBRs had 38% larger fat deposits than CONs (p<0.05), as evaluated by volume of epididymis fat, an acknowledged marker of fat deposits in rats. Contrary to our expectations, OBRs had better scores of memory behavioral tasks than CONs throughout the experiment. At one year, their hippocampi were by 2.6% larger than in CONs (p = 0.05), whereas concentration of tNAA was 9.8% higher (p = 0.014).Long-term HFD in our study resulted in better memory, larger hippocampal volumes, as well as higher hippocampal metabolite concentrations, possibly due to increased levels of blood ketone bodies. The results should be interpreted with caution, as results from animal models do not necessarily directly translate in human condition."
https://openalex.org/W2149714879,"Introduction TNF-α levels are increased during muscle wasting and chronic muscle degeneration and regeneration processes, which are characteristic for primary muscle disorders. Pathologically increased TNF-α levels have a negative effect on muscle cell differentiation efficiency, while IGF1 can have a positive effect; therefore, we intended to elucidate the impact of TNF-α and IGF1 on gene expression during the early stages of skeletal muscle cell differentiation. Methodology/Principal Findings This study presents gene expression data of the murine skeletal muscle cells PMI28 during myogenic differentiation or differentiation with TNF-α or IGF1 exposure at 0 h, 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h after induction. Our study detected significant coregulation of gene sets involved in myoblast differentiation or in the response to TNF-α. Gene expression data revealed a time- and treatment-dependent regulation of signaling pathways, which are prominent in myogenic differentiation. We identified enrichment of pathways, which have not been specifically linked to myoblast differentiation such as doublecortin-like kinase pathway associations as well as enrichment of specific semaphorin isoforms. Moreover to the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a specific inverse regulation of the following genes in myoblast differentiation and response to TNF-α: Aknad1, Cmbl, Sepp1, Ndst4, Tecrl, Unc13c, Spats2l, Lix1, Csdc2, Cpa1, Parm1, Serpinb2, Aspn, Fibin, Slc40a1, Nrk, and Mybpc1. We identified a gene subset (Nfkbia, Nfkb2, Mmp9, Mef2c, Gpx, and Pgam2), which is robustly regulated by TNF-α across independent myogenic differentiation studies. Conclusions This is the largest dataset revealing the impact of TNF-α or IGF1 treatment on gene expression kinetics of early in vitro skeletal myoblast differentiation. We identified novel mRNAs, which have not yet been associated with skeletal muscle differentiation or response to TNF-α. Results of this study may facilitate the understanding of transcriptomic networks underlying inhibited muscle differentiation in inflammatory diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2206321152,"Fitts’ Law describes the speed-accuracy trade-off of human movements, and it is an elegant strategy that compensates for random and uncontrollable noise in the motor system. The control strategy during targeted movements may also take into account the rewards or costs of any outcomes that may occur. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that movement time in Fitts’ Law emerges not only from the accuracy constraints of the task, but also depends on the perceived cost of error for missing the targets. Subjects were asked to touch targets on an iPad® screen with different costs for missed targets. We manipulated the probability of error by comparing children with dystonia (who are characterized by increased intrinsic motor variability) to typically developing children. The results show a strong effect of the cost of error on the Fitts’ Law relationship characterized by an increase in movement time as cost increased. In addition, we observed a greater sensitivity to increased cost for children with dystonia, and this behavior appears to minimize the average cost. The findings support a proposed mathematical model that explains how movement time in a Fitts-like task is related to perceived risk."
https://openalex.org/W2212454633,"Amino acid transporters are located at specific subcellular compartments, and their localizations are regulated by the extracellular availability of amino acids. In yeast, target of rapamycin (TOR) activation induces the internalization of amino acid transporters located at the plasma membrane. However, whether and how TOR signaling regulates other amino acid transporters located at intracellular compartments remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in the fission yeast, the TOR inhibitor Torin–1 induces the transfer of several yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-fused intracellular amino acid transporters, including Agp3, Isp5, Aat1, and Put4, from trans-Golgi/endosomes into the vacuoles. By contrast, the localizations of YFP-fused Can1, Fnx1, and Fnx2 transporter proteins were unaffected upon Torin–1 treatment. There are two TOR isoforms in fission yeast, Tor1 and Tor2. Whereas tor1 deletion did not affect the Torin-1-induced transfer of Agp3-YFP, Tor2 inhibition using a temperature-sensitive mutant induced the transfer of Agp3-YFP to the vacuolar lumen, similar to the effects of Torin–1 treatment. Tor2 inhibition also induced the transfer of the YFP-fused Isp5, Aat1, and Put4 transporter proteins to the vacuoles, although only partial transfer of the latter two transporters was observed. Under nitrogen depletion accompanied by reduced Tor2 activity, Agp3-YFP was transferred from the trans-Golgi/endosomes to the plasma membrane and then to the vacuoles, where it was degraded by the vacuolar proteases Isp6 and Psp3. Mutants with constitutively active Tor2 showed delayed transfer of Agp3-YFP to the plasma membrane upon nitrogen depletion. Cells lacking Tsc2, a negative regulator of Tor2, also showed a delay in this process in a Tor2-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that constitutive Tor2 activity is critical for the retention of amino acid transporters at trans-Golgi/endosomes. Moreover, nitrogen depletion suppresses Tor2 activity through Tsc2, thereby promoting the surface expression of these transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2223833120,"Background A comprehensive search for DNA methylated genes identified candidate tumor suppressor genes that have been proven to be involved in the apoptotic process of the p53 pathway. In this study, we investigated p53 mutation in relation to such epigenetic alteration in primary gastric cancer. Methods The methylation profiles of the 3 genes: PGP9.5, NMDAR2B, and CCNA1, which are involved in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway in combination with p53 mutation were examined in 163 primary gastric cancers. The effect of epigenetic reversion in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs on apoptosis was also assessed according to the tumor p53 mutation status. Results p53 gene mutations were found in 44 primary gastric tumors (27%), and super-high methylation of any of the 3 genes was only found in cases with wild type p53. Higher p53 pathway aberration was found in cases with male gender (p = 0.003), intestinal type (p = 0.005), and non-infiltrating type (p = 0.001). The p53 pathway aberration group exhibited less recurrence in lymph nodes, distant organs, and peritoneum than the p53 non-aberration group. In the NUGC4 gastric cancer cell line (p53 wild type), epigenetic treatment augmented apoptosis by chemotherapeutic drugs, partially through p53 transcription activity. On the other hand, in the KATO III cancer cell line (p53 mutant), epigenetic treatment alone induced robust apoptosis, with no trans-activation of p53. Conclusion In gastric cancer, p53 relevant and non-relevant pathways exist, and tumors with either pathway type exhibited unique clinical features. Epigenetic treatments can induce apoptosis partially through p53 activation, however their apoptotic effects may be explained largely by mechanism other than through p53 pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2342067644,"Background In order to select patients most likely to benefit for thrombolysis and to predict patient outcome in acute ischemic stroke, the volumetric assessment of the infarcted tissue is used. However, infarct volume estimation on Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has moderate interrater variability despite the excellent contrast between ischemic lesion and healthy tissue. In this study, we compared volumetric measurements of DWI hyperintensity to a simple maximum orthogonal diameter approach to identify thresholds indicating infarct size >70 ml and >100 ml. Methods Patients presenting with ischemic stroke with an NIHSS of ≥ 8 were examined with stroke MRI within 24 h after symptom onset. For assessment of the orthogonal DWI lesion diameters (od-values) the image with the largest lesion appearance was chosen. The maximal diameter of the lesion was determined and a second diameter was measured perpendicular. Both diameters were multiplied. Od-values were compared to volumetric measurement and od-value thresholds identifying a lesion size of > 70 ml and > 100 ml were determined. In a selected dataset with an even distribution of lesion sizes we compared the results of the od value thresholds with results of the ABC/2 and estimations of lesion volumes made by two resident physicians. Results For 108 included patients (53 female, mean age 71.36 years) with a median infarct volume of 13.4 ml we found an excellent correlation between volumetric measures and od-values (r2 = 0.951). Infarct volume >100 ml corresponds to an od-value cut off of 42; > 70 ml corresponds to an od-value of 32. In the compiled dataset (n = 50) od-value thresholds identified infarcts > 100 ml / > 70 ml with a sensitivity of 90%/ 93% and with a specificity of 98%/ 89%. The od-value offered a higher accuracy in identifying large infarctions compared to both visual estimations and the ABC/2 method. Conclusion The simple od-value enables identification of large DWI lesions in acute stroke. The cutoff of 42 is useful to identify large infarctions with volume larger than 100 ml. Further studies can analyze the therapeutic utility of this new method. Trail Registration ClinicalTrials.org NCT00715533"
https://openalex.org/W2222986485,"Inflammation is a complex, biologic event that aims to protect and repair tissue. Previous studies suggest that inflammation is critical to induce a healing response following acute injury; however, whether similar inflammatory responses occur as a result of beneficial, non-injurious loading is unknown. The objective of this study was to screen for alterations in a subset of inflammatory and extracellular matrix genes to identify the responses of rat supraspinatus tendon and muscle to a known, non-injurious loading condition. We sought to define how a subset of genes representative of specific inflammation and matrix turnover pathways is altered in supraspinatus tendon and muscle 1) acutely following a single loading bout and 2) chronically following repeated loading bouts. In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats in the acute group ran a single bout of non-injurious exercise on a flat treadmill (10 m/min, 1 hour) and were sacrificed 12 or 24 hours after. Rats in the chronic group ran 5 days/wk for 1 or 8 weeks. A control group maintained normal cage activity. Supraspinatus muscle and tendon were harvested for RNA extractions, and a custom Panomics QuantiGene 2.0 multiplex assay was used to detect 48 target and 3 housekeeping genes. Muscle/tendon and acute/chronic groups had distinct gene expression. Components of the arachidonic acid cascade and matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors were altered with acute and chronic exercise. Collagen expression increased. Using a previously validated model of non-injurious exercise, we have shown that supraspinatus tendon and muscle respond to acute and chronic exercise by regulating inflammatory- and matrix turnover-related genes, suggesting that these pathways are involved in the beneficial adaptations to exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2266557121,"Our molecular modeling studies suggest a charge-dependent interaction between residues Glu-497 in the relay domain and Arg-712 in the converter domain of human β-cardiac myosin. To test the significance of this putative interaction, we generated transgenic Drosophila expressing indirect flight muscle myosin with charge reversal mutations in the relay (E496R) or converter (R713E). Each mutation yielded dramatic reductions in myosin Ca-ATPase activity (~80%) as well as in basal (~67%) and actin-activated (~84%) Mg-ATPase activity. E496R myosin-induced in vitro actin-sliding velocity was reduced by 71% and R713E myosin permitted no actin motility. Indirect flight muscles of late pupae from each mutant displayed disrupted myofibril assembly, with adults having severely abnormal myofibrils and no flight ability. To understand the molecular basis of these defects, we constructed a putative compensatory mutant that expresses myosin with both E496R and R713E. Intriguingly, ATPase values were restored to ~73% of wild-type and actin-sliding velocity increased to 40%. The double mutation suppresses myofibril assembly defects in pupal indirect flight muscles and dramatically reduces myofibril disruption in young adults. Although sarcomere organization is not sustained in older flies and flight ability is not restored in homozygotes, young heterozygotes fly well. Our results indicate that this charge-dependent interaction between the myosin relay and converter domains is essential to the mechanochemical cycle and sarcomere assembly. Furthermore, the same inter-domain interaction is disrupted when modeling human β-cardiac myosin heavy chain cardiomyopathy mutations E497D or R712L, implying that abolishing this salt bridge is one cause of the human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2256495303,"Frameshifting during translation of viral or in rare cases cellular mRNA results in the synthesis of proteins from two overlapping reading frames within the same mRNA. In HIV-1 the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase enzymes are in a second reading frame relative to the structural group-specific antigen (gag), and their synthesis is dependent upon frameshifting. This ensures that a strictly regulated ratio of structural proteins and enzymes, which is critical for HIV-1 replication and viral infectivity, is maintained during protein synthesis. The frameshift element in HIV-1 RNA is an attractive target for the development of a new class of anti HIV-1 drugs. However, a number of examples are now emerging of human genes using −1 frameshifting, such as PEG10 and CCR5. In this study we have compared the HIV-1 and PEG10 frameshift elements and shown they have distinct functional characteristics. Frameshifting occurs at several points within each element. Moreover, frameshift modulators that were isolated by high-throughput screening of a library of 114,000 lead-like compounds behaved differently with the PEG10 frameshift element. The most effective compounds affecting the HIV-1 element enhanced frameshifting by 2.5-fold at 10 μM in two different frameshift reporter assay systems. HIV-1 protease:gag protein ratio was affected by a similar amount in a specific assay of virally-infected cultured cell, but the modulation of frameshifting of the first-iteration compounds was not sufficient to show significant effects on viral infectivity. Importantly, two compounds did not affect frameshifting with the human PEG10 element, while one modestly inhibited rather than enhanced frameshifting at the human element. These studies indicate that frameshift elements have unique characteristics that may allow targeting of HIV-1 and of other viruses specifically for development of antiviral therapeutic molecules without effect on human genes like PEG10 that use the same generic mechanism."

Four examiners controlled the SPCE using PillCamSB2, -ESO2, and -COLON2 (Given Imaging Ltd., Israel), for 10 minutes each with the aim of detecting as many buttons and examining them as closely as possible. The ability to find lesions was assessed based on the number of detected buttons. The SPCE-performance score (SPS) was used to evaluate the ability to examine the lesions in detail.The SPCE-ESO2, -COLON2, and -SB2 detected 11 [interquartile range (IQR): 0], 10.5 (IQR, 0.5), and 8 (IQR, 1.0) buttons, respectively. The SPCE-ESO2 and -COLON2 had a significantly better ability to detect lesions than the -SB2 (p < 0.05). The SPCE-ESO2, -COLON2, and -SB2 had significantly different SPS values of 22 (IQR, 0), 16.5 (IQR, 1.5), and 14 (IQR, 1.0), respectively (p < 0.05 for all comparisons; SPCE-SB2 vs. -ESO2, -SB2 vs. -COLON2, and -ESO2 vs. -COLON2).PillCamESO2 is most suitable in different three CEs for SPCE for examining lesions in detail of the stomach."

T. cruzi autophagin-2 (TcAtg4.2) carries the majority of proteolytic activity and is responsible for processing Atg8 proteins near the carboxyl terminus, exposing a conserved glycine. This enables progression of autophagy and differentiation of the parasite, which is required for successful colonization of humans. The mechanism of substrate hydrolysis by Atg4 was found to be highly conserved among the species as critical mutations in the TcAtg4.2, including mutation of the conserved Gly-244 residue in the hinge region enabling flexibility of the regulatory loop, and deletion of the regulatory loop, completely abolished processing capacity of the mutants. Using the positional scanning-substrate combinatorial library (PS-SCL) we determined that TcAtg4.2 tolerates a broad spectrum of amino acids in the P4 and P3 positions, similar to the human orthologue autophagin-1 (HsAtg4B). In contrast, both human and trypanosome Atg4 orthologues exhibited exclusive preference for aromatic amino acid residues in the P2 position, and for Gly in the P1 position, which is absolutely conserved in the natural Atg8 substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2212566338,"Small populations of endangered species can be impacted by genetic processes such as drift and inbreeding that reduce population viability. As such, conservation genetic analyses that assess population levels of genetic variation and levels of gene flow can provide important information for managing threatened species. The São Paulo Marsh Antwren (Formicivora paludicola) is a recently-described and critically endangered bird from São Paulo State (Brazil) whose total estimated population is around 250-300 individuals, distributed in only 15 isolated marshes around São Paulo metropolitan region. We used microsatellite DNA markers to estimate the population genetic characteristics of the three largest remaining populations of this species all within 60 km of each other. We detected a high and significant genetic structure between all populations (overall FST = 0.103) which is comparable to the highest levels of differentiation ever documented for birds, (e.g., endangered birds found in isolated populations on the tops of African mountains), but also evidence for first-generation immigrants, likely from small local unsampled populations. Effective population sizes were small (between 28.8-99.9 individuals) yet there are high levels of genetic variability within populations and no evidence for inbreeding. Conservation implications of this work are that the high levels of genetic structure suggests that translocations between populations need to be carefully considered in light of possible local adaptation and that remaining populations of these birds should be managed as conservation units that contain both main populations studied here but also small outlying populations which may be a source of immigrants."
https://openalex.org/W2113976858,"Metabolic syndrome is characterized by visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, high triglyceride (TG)- and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-levels, hypertension, and diabetes-all of which often cause cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. It remains unclear, however, why visceral adiposity but not subcutaneous adiposity causes insulin resistance and other pathological situations. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) catalyzes hydrolysis of TG in plasma lipoproteins. In the present study, we investigated whether the effects of angiotensin II (AngII) on TG metabolism are mediated through an effect on LPL expression. Adipose tissues were divided into visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) for comparison. AngII accelerated LPL expression in SAT but, on the contrary, suppressed its expression in VAT. In both SAT and VAT, AngII signaled through the same type 1 receptor. In SAT, AngII increased LPL expression via c-Src and p38 MAPK signaling. In VAT, however, AngII reduced LPL expression via the Gq class of G proteins and the subsequent phospholipase C β4 (PLCβ4), protein kinase C β1, nuclear factor κB, and inducible nitric oxide synthase signaling pathways. PLCβ4 small interfering RNA experiments showed that PLCβ4 expression is important for the AngII-induced LPL reduction in VAT, in which PLCβ4 expression increases in the evening and falls at night. Interestingly, PLCβ4 expression in VAT decreased with fasting, while AngII did not decrease LPL expression in VAT in a fasting state. In conclusion, AngII reduces LPL expression through PLCβ4, the expression of which is regulated by feeding in VAT, whereas AngII increases LPL expression in SAT. The different effects of AngII on LPL expression and, hence, TG metabolism in VAT and SAT may partly explain their different contributions to the development of metabolic syndrome."

This study investigated the role of SOB in the association between Quality of Life (QOL), a proxy of psychological stress status, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration (i.e., inflammatory status) among 1,085 adults (aged 20-57 years old) in Hainan Island, China. High sensitivity CRP concentration was measured in dried blood spot samples, while the abbreviated version of the World Health Organization's QOL questionnaire was used to gather information on six QOL domains. Analysis stratified by three historically distinct age groups revealed a significant association between CRP concentration, SOB, QOL and an interaction between SOB and QOL among the youngest and oldest groups. In the oldest group, those born in the dry season had a higher CRP concentration with worse QOL whereas in the youngest group, there was a higher CRP concentration with better QOL. Annual per capita rice production, a proxy of population nutritional status in the year of birth, was found to predict CRP concentration only among the second oldest group. These findings suggest that the early environment might affect the immune response to psychological stress in adulthood and that its effect may differ by the time period in which people were born."

Therefore, to improve utility and practicality of such assays, the objective of this study was to assess the use of a novel white blood cell preservation technology in whole bovine blood. Blood samples from ten healthy cows were each divided into an unpreserved control sample and a test sample preserved with commercially-available cell transport medium. Samples were maintained at room temperature and stimulated with the mitogens pokeweed and concanavalinA, as well as with interleukin-12 p40. Stimulation was completed on days 1, 5, and 8 post-sampling. Viability of white blood cells was assessed through interferon gamma production determined with a commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, mononuclear cell viability was assessed with propidium iodide flow cytometry. Greater interferon gamma production was observed on days 5 and 8 post-collection in preserved samples, with both pokeweed and concanavalinA stimulating positive interferon gamma production on day 5 post-collection. A greater proportion of the amount of interferon gamma produced on day 1 continued to be produced on days 5 and 8 post-collection with concanavalinA stimulation (with or without interleukin 12) as compared to pokeweed stimulation. Additionally, viable mononuclear cells were still present at eight days post-collection, with a higher mean proportion detected at days 5 and 8 in all stimulated preserved samples. This practical and simple method to extend in vitro white blood cell viability could benefit the efficient utilization of cell-based blood tests in ruminants."
