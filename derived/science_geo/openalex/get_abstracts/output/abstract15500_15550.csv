https://openalex.org/W2051202848,"Rats learned to press a lever for intravenous injections of amphetamine or apomorphine. They also learned to avoid the taste of saccharin which was associated with experimenter-administered amphetamine or with self-administered apomorphine. Thus these, and presumably other, self-administered drugs serve as compound pharmacological stimuli, having both positively reinforcing and aversive properties."
https://openalex.org/W1987321043,"Although people experience little difficulty in recognizing printed words and comprehending sentences, they cannot do it instantaneously. Experimental psychologists have recently measured the speed of these mental processes by applying a reaction-time method. The method provides new data concerning the organization and retrieval of familiar semantic information in human memory. It has been found that close relations between the meanings of words help people to recognize and pronounce the words faster, especially when the words are hard to see because of visual distortions. Close relations between word meanings also facilitate the comprehension of some sentences, as indicated by how long a person takes to decide whether the sentences are true or false. The facilitation is not universal, however. When the relation between the meanings of two words must be analyzed carefully, their proximity may actually inhibit mental processing. These results, along with additional findings, support the hypothesis that human memory includes a semantic network that represents various categories of objects at distinct locations linked to specify their relations with each other. The memory structure probably influences a number of different mental processes that use it. One possible access route to the network is through a set of detectors designed to accumulate sensory information and signal the presence of particular words. There also appear to be processes for searching and comparing pieces of knowledge after a person finds the memory locations of designated categories. Further research using the reaction-time method may provide a more detailed inventory of what facts are retrieved directly from memory and what are computed from other stored information (36)."
https://openalex.org/W1998592679,"Nitrogen fixation in marine Oscillatoria appears to be associated with differentiated cells located in the center of the colony. These central cells exhibit reduced pigmentation relative to peripherally located cells and do not incorporate 14CO2 in photosynthesis. Central cells apparently do not produce O2 which would deactivate nitrogenase. When central cells are exposed to O2 via disruption of the colonies, N2 fixation (acetylene reduction) decreases sharply even though individual trichomes remain intact. Disruption of colonies in the absence of O2 does not cause reduced nitrogenase activity. In the sea, turbulence from wave action apparently separates trichomes allowing O2 to enter thus decreasing nitrogenase activity. These observations explain how Oscillatoria is able to fix N2 without heterocysts in an aerobic environment and why it blooms virtually always occur in calm seas."

https://openalex.org/W2027247993,"Juvenile male rats given intracerebroventricular injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, following treatment with desmethylimipramine, maintained body weight gains of 5 to 6 grams per day into adulthood and grew much larger than control rats. Biochemical analyses of brain tissue obtained 50 to 140 days after the injections revealed 60 to 86% depletions of telencephalic 5-hydroxytryptamine, with catecholamine levels unchanged. Hyperphagia did not develop despite comparable losses of 5-hydroxytryptamine when the pretreatment was withheld, perhaps because substantial depletions of norepinephrine occurred as well."

This functional dichotomy of the two notes in the male's call reflects a difference in the distribution of the best excitatory frequencies of primary auditory neurons for the males and females. To the best of our knowledge, Eleutherodactylus is the first known example of a vertebrate in which the peripheral auditory sensitivity shows a sexual difference."

These results, coupled with previous data showing that microiontophoretic application of d-amphetamine directly onto dopaminergic cells does not produce significant slowing, provide direct support for the hypothesis that the depressant effect of d-amphetamine on these cells is mediated through a striato-nigral neuronal feedback loop."

https://openalex.org/W2071522533,"L-canavanine is a highly toxic L-arginine analog found in some leguminous seeds. Larvae of the bruchid beetle Caryedes brasiliensis, collected in Costa Rica, subsist solely on tissues of the mature seed of Dioclea megacarpa, which contains more than 8 percent L-canavanine by dry weight. The arginyl-tRNA synthetase of the bruchid beetle larvae discriminates between L-arginine and L-canavanine, and canavanyl proteins are not synthesized. In this way, bruchid beetle larvae avoid an adverse biochemical effect of L-canavanine."
https://openalex.org/W2058112032,"Tin greatly enhances heme breakdown in kidney, thus impairing heme-dependent cellular functions, such as cytochrome P-450 mediated drug biotransformation. This novel action of the metal results from a potent induction effect on heme oxygenase, the enzyme that catalyzes heme oxidation in microsomes. The possible toxicological implications of this tin effect in the kidney merit further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2063991916,"Bees trained to come to the laboratory for a 20% sucrose solution accept it readily, but bees trained with a 40% sucrose solution and tested with the 20% solution show a pattern of interrupted feeding that may last for several minutes. Bees trained with 20% and tested with 40% sucrose are undisturbed. When the animals are offered two samples of the 20% solution simultaneously, they drink to repletion from whichever they first taste on each visit, but if both a 20% and a 40% drop are offered the 20% solution is rejected after a single experience of the 40% solution. Although these results are analogous in many respects to incentive contrast effects found in mammals, they can be understood in sensory terms and do not require the assumption of learning about reward."
https://openalex.org/W2041544429,Radiolabeled reiterated DNA specific for the human Y chromosome has been obtained by extensive reassociations between [3H]DNA prepared from men and excess DNA from women. These highly purifed labeled sequences reassociate only with DNA from individuals with a Y chromosome. The percentage of Y-chromosome-specific DNA isolated from individuals with differing numbers of Y chromosomes is a function of the number of chromosomes present. The purifed Y-chromosome-specific sequences may represent between 7 and 11 percent of the human Y chromosome.
https://openalex.org/W2077784635,"Whether neuropsychological impairment occurs in children with increased lead absorption who are without clinical symptoms is of current concern. This issue, which involves potentially large numbers of children, remains unresolved, in part because of the lack of sensitive biochemical indicators of the effects of lead on the nervous system. In experimental subclinical lead poisoning in mice, significant increases in homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid have been found in brain and urine. In children with increased lead absorption, these acids were measured in urine collected quantitatively under controlled dietary conditions; preliminary results show fivefold increases in the daily output of these compounds. These data suggest that the altered catecholamine metabolism also occurs in children."

https://openalex.org/W1994264478,"The sex pheromone of the oak leaf roller, Archips semiferanus, was identified as a specific blend (67:33) of trans-11- and cis-11-tetradecenyl acetates. The pheromone blend of females from a semisynthetic diet and from three oak species did not vary significantly. Males from these diets responsded in the laboratory and the field only to treatments approximating the 67 : 33 blend. These findings conflict with the hypothesis that the composition and perception of month sex pheromones vary with slight changes in diet."

https://openalex.org/W2067651906,"Homocysteic acid, H03SCH2CH2CHNH2CO2H, promotes growth of hypophysectomized rats, assayed by observation of increased thickness of epiphyseal cartilage of the tibia and by observation of tail growth. Doses of homocysteic acid as low as 1 microgram per day for 4 days in the tibia assay and 2.5 milligrams per kilogram per day for 5 weeks in the tail assay were effective in promoting growth. Serum somatomedin activity, determined by the porcine cartilage disk assay, was also increased by homocysteic acid. These findings relate an area of sulfur amino acid metabolism to the physiological action of growth hormone, accelerated growth in homocystinuria, initiation of arteriosclerosis, and control of cellular growth."

https://openalex.org/W2051264029,"In rats injected with morphine in the midbrain reticular formation, pronounced ipsilateral rotation behavior was elicited by mild auditory and visual stimuli. The frequency of occurrence and rate of rotation were dose-dependent. This effect was site specific and drug specific; other drugs (except heroin) failed to induce this behavior. Naloxone potentiated the morphine rotation. Pretreatment with drugs that either potentiated or attenuated the morphine rotation indicated involvement of the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems and excluded a role for the dopaminergic system. No analgesia was observed after morphine microinjection in this site; thus, the hyperresponsivity to mild auditory and visual stimuli and concurrent analgesia previously seen in animals with morphine microinjections in the periaqueductal gray matter appear to be dissociable effects of morphine, and site specific."

https://openalex.org/W1979174650,"The crystal and molecular structure of prostaglandin B1 (PGB1) has been determined. The conformation is L-shaped, with the α and ω side chains roughly perpendicular to one another. This arrangement differs from the ""hairpin"" or approximately parallel disposition of side chains observed for other prostaglandins. The ω chain, which normally turns at the 15-hydroxyl back toward the α chain, is fully extended. The conformation is stabilized by the conjugation of the dienone chromophore. The 15-hydroxyl, which is normally directed away from the centroid of the prostaglandin in the hairpin model, is turned inward in L-shaped PGB1. The low biological activity of PGB1 in many systems and especially its inhibition of the metabolizing enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase may be attributable directly to the observed L-shape conformation."

They, like normal rats, also drink more when cellular dehydration is superimposed upon water deprivation. Unlike normal rats, however, rats with lesions in the lateral preoptic area do not increase their rate of lever-pressing in response to the combined stimulus. Thus, the urge to drink can be separated from the amount of fluid drunk."
