https://openalex.org/W2622807556,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and AD-transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic Aβ particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)−/− Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI3NTkxOWNiYzJjNTRkOTNkZjI3NmZmM2FlZTVjNTQ3YiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MjcwNzM3fQ.NoN5aITr_BS7qvN_8WrGyzf6LaApJIX4-Mn9mHhAaMdRfzQTQwSyKRLws7etN25jC7QE-nLtMDQCAxTPqWUOBwWT10u7JzGVNWB9igoii7AJwpjjtlyX-uys-YMETgJp8wTsce2pQYKgb8xAwGDLTpeotV0pk44MNwj-TYmKBqsohtEPvINWnr7th9zCg89HWCI7OanD468WxwTfwqlYw5i4Ptx-lokM8w9Qz1w_xNYFJs7ymweszJSYiRFCbB0FFo3t-EWRSpYS3R3DwE0G5QVoSzEDP8-d2TEFlMpw6hMkRy8K0TsqmgNU81Ocz5CuoxG2L7nMjFD41VMW6F5aDQ(mp4, (68.53 MB) Download video"

Our model explains how dynactin binding to the dynein-1 tail directly stimulates its motor activity. Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) associates with dynactin to form an efficient microtubule motor that transports cargo to the minus end of microtubules and organizes the internal components of eukaryotic cells. Disruption of this 2.4-megadalton machine disperses the Golgi network (Burkhardt et al., 1997Burkhardt J.K. Echeverri C.J. Nilsson T. Vallee R.B.

Wolfstein A. Prank U. Echeverri C. Dujardin D. Vallee R. Sodeik B. Function of dynein and dynactin in herpes simplex virus capsid transport.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2795-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, dynein and dynactin are required during cell division for spindle formation and correct chromosome alignment (Echeverri et al., 1996Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. Molecular characterization of the 50-kD subunit of dynactin reveals function for the complex in chromosome alignment and spindle organization during mitosis.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Dynein must therefore be carefully regulated to ensure the correct timing and location of motor activation. In cells, most dynein is diffuse in the cytoplasm, with only a small fraction on microtubules (Splinter et al., 2012Splinter D. Razafsky D.S. Schlager M.A. Serra-Marques A. Grigoriev I. Demmers J. Keijzer N. Jiang K. Poser I. Hyman A.A. et al.BICD2, dynactin, and LIS1 cooperate in regulating dynein recruitment to cellular structures.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4226-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This prevents dynein from inappropriately saturating microtubules or traveling unnecessarily and ensures there is a pool of dynein ready to transport cargos when required. The switch of dynein and dynactin from diffuse to actively transporting cargo is controlled at many levels. It can be driven both in vitro (Mallik et al., 2005Mallik R. Petrov D. Lex S.A. King S.J.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 13190-13203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The switch is also controlled at the level of the dynein/dynactin machinery itself. Whereas isolated human dynein is weakly processive in vitro (Trokter et al., 2012Trokter M. Mücke N. Surrey T. Reconstitution of the human cytoplasmic dynein complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 20895-20900Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it can be activated to move over long distances (>500 nm) by binding to dynactin and a cargo-specific adaptor protein such as BICD2 (McKenney et al., 2014McKenney R.J.

Schlager M.A. Foster H. Reimer A.E. Carter A.P. Yildiz A. The mammalian dynein-dynactin complex is a strong opponent to kinesin in a tug-of-war competition.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 1018-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) of individual motors. Dynein consists of two motor domains that are responsible for ATP hydrolysis and force production and a tail region that holds them together. It is unclear why dynein is only weakly processive on its own and how it is activated by dynactin and cargo adaptors. There is some evidence that dynein processivity is directly inhibited by the C-terminal ∼300 amino acids of the motor domain (Nicholas et al., 2015Nicholas M.P. Höök P. Brenner S. Wynne C.L. Vallee R.B. Gennerich A. Control of cytoplasmic dynein force production and processivity by its C-terminal domain.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Another theory is that inhibition is due to the tail region folding back to contact the motor domains until cargo binds (Belyy et al., 2016Belyy V. Schlager M.A. Foster H. Reimer A.E. Carter A.P. Yildiz A. The mammalian dynein-dynactin complex is a strong opponent to kinesin in a tug-of-war competition.Nat.

Motor- and tail-dependent targeting of dynein to microtubule plus ends and the cell cortex.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 196-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A similar inhibition mechanism is used by cytoskeletal motors in the kinesin (Kaan et al., 2011Kaan H.Y.K. Hackney D.D. Kozielski F. The structure of the kinesin-1 motor-tail complex reveals the mechanism of autoinhibition.Science. 2011; 333: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and myosin families (Hammer and Sellers, 2011Hammer 3rd, J.A. Sellers J.R. Walking to work: Roles for class V myosins as cargo transporters.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been proposed that dynein is auto-inhibited by self-dimerization of its motor domains (Torisawa et al., 2014Torisawa T. Ichikawa M. Furuta A. Saito K. Oiwa K. Kojima H. Toyoshima Y.Y. Furuta K. Autoinhibition and cooperative activation mechanisms of cytoplasmic dynein.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This form of dynein is referred to as the phi-particle because of its resemblance to the Greek letter phi (φ) (Amos, 1989Amos L.A. Brain dynein crossbridges microtubules into bundles.J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 19-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation was suggested to result from a shift in the equilibrium of dynein conformations toward an open form in which the motor domains are separated. In support of this, forced separation of isolated dynein motor domains can increase motor activity (Torisawa et al., 2014Torisawa T. Ichikawa M. Furuta A. Saito K. Oiwa K. Kojima H. Toyoshima Y.Y. Furuta K. Autoinhibition and cooperative activation mechanisms of cytoplasmic dynein.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, these studies were performed on artificially dimerized dynein motors lacking the tail region. It is therefore not clear whether the tail contributes to inhibition or what role the phi-particle plays in the context of the whole dynein complex. In this study, we set out to determine whether the phi-particle contributes to dynein auto-inhibition and how dynein is activated by dynactin. We use cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of the phi-particle. We show how the motor domains self-dimerize and are locked in a conformation with weak affinity for microtubules. Disrupting the motor dimer by structure-based mutagenesis drives dynein into an open form with increased affinity for microtubules and dynactin. Surprisingly, we discover that the open form of dynein is also inhibited. We use a combination of 2D analysis of EM images and a 3D cryo-EM structure of the whole dynein/dynactin machinery to explain how dynactin overcomes this inhibition and directly reorients the motor domains to make dynein processive. Finally, we show that disrupting the phi-particle in cells causes mis-localization and mitotic defects, supporting a physiological role for the phi-particle in dynein regulation. To understand the role of the phi-particle in dynein auto-inhibition, we solved the structure of full-length human cytoplasmic dynein-1 by cryo-EM (Figure 1A). In initial negative stain EM images, we observed dynein in a mixture of forms; the phi-particle (phi-dynein) and an open form where the motors are separated (open-dynein) (Figure S1A). We used exclusively freshly purified protein produced in insect cells for structure determination. Under these conditions, the proportion of phi-dynein is greater than 85%.Figure S1Cryo-EM Image Processing Summary, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Negative-stain electron micrograph of the recombinant human dynein-1.

Most regions of the tail are resolved to a resolution of ∼7-9Å. The motor domain resolution ranges from ∼3.3Å in the core to ∼4.3Å on the surface. To determine the structure, we collected 714,571 raw dynein particles in vitrified ice (Figure S1B; Table S1). Initial 2D classification revealed the dynein tail was highly flexible relative to the motor domain dimer (Figure S1C). Sub-classification allowed us to visualize the flexibility of the tail (Figure S1D; Movie S1) and to solve a 15 Å resolution structure of the whole phi-particle (Figure 1A). We locally masked either the tail or the motor domain and processed these independently to obtain higher resolution information (Figures S1E and S1F). The main tail class was refined to an 8.4 Å reconstruction (Figures S1G and S1H) that contains clearly defined secondary structure features (Figure 1B). The map of the motor domain dimer reached 3.8 Å resolution (Figures S1G and S1H), allowing us to build a full atomic model (Figure 1B; Table S1). We fit the separate motor domain and tail densities into our 15 Å map of full-length dynein to reveal the architecture of the entire complex (Figure 1A; Movie S2). The dynein tail is an essential part of the dynein/dynactin transport machine, linking the two motor domains to dynactin and cargo adaptors. Our complete 3D structure of the tail (Figures 2A and S2A) agrees well with the overall architecture proposed in previous 2D negative stain EM (Chowdhury et al., 2015Chowdhury S. Ketcham S.A. Schroer T.A. Lander G.C. Structural organization of the dynein-dynactin complex bound to microtubules.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is formed of two copies of the dynein heavy chain (HC) each containing a 200-amino-acid N-terminal dimerization domain (NDD) (Urnavicius et al., 2015Urnavicius L. Zhang K. Diamant A.G. Motz C.

Each dynein HC binds to a dynein intermediate chain (IC) and light intermediate chain (LIC). We fit a homology model of the IC C-terminal WD40 domain into density (Figure S2C) that contacts the HC bundles 4 and 5 (Figure 2B). We also docked a homology model of the human LIC into our map (Figure S2D). The LIC binds to the HC bundles 6 and 7 (Figure 2B) using a series of conserved hydrophobic residues near its N terminus, in agreement with previous predictions (Schroeder et al., 2014Schroeder C.M.

(E) Ribbon representation of the contact region between LIC B and HC B. A series of conserved hydrophobic residues of the LIC (yellow, stick representation) are seen to interact with the HC. The dynein tail also contains dimers of three light chains (LCs: Robl/LC7, Tctex, LC8), which bind the extended N terminus of the IC. We see a three-layered density adjacent to the IC WD40 domains, which fits the Robl dimer (Figure S3A) (Song et al., 2005Song J. Tyler R.C. Lee M.S. Tyler E.M. Markley J.L. Solution structure of isoform 1 of Roadblock/LC7, a light chain in the dynein complex.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This density lies on one side of the dynein tail (Figure 2A). On this same face, we see additional density docked to the neck region of HC A (Figure 2A). We tentatively assign this to the structure of LC8 and Tctex dimers (Williams et al., 2007Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Structural and thermodynamic characterization of a cytoplasmic dynein light chain-intermediate chain complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) on account of weak density linking it to Robl. This curved linkage is ∼20 nm long, consistent with the length of the N-terminal IC polypeptide known to connect Robl and LC8 (Figure S3B). Previous negative stain EM studies on open-dynein show the LCs trailing away from the tail (Chowdhury et al., 2015Chowdhury S. Ketcham S.A. Schroer T.A. Lander G.C. Structural organization of the dynein-dynactin complex bound to microtubules.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, the LC8/Tctex interaction with the HC may be specific to phi-dynein. The HCs in the phi-particle tail are held together at three main sites. The first contact site is the NDD, which lies between helical bundles 1 and 2 (Figure 2B). This part of the tail is dynamic and adopts multiple conformations. Extensive sub-classification revealed a “twisted” form that is dominant, a less populated “parallel” state (Figures 2C and S3C; Movie S3), and a variety of intermediate states. Of these, the parallel state is most similar to the conformation of this region when bound to dynactin (Urnavicius et al., 2015Urnavicius L. Zhang K. Diamant A.G. Motz C. Schlager M.A. Yu M. Patel N.A. Robinson C.V. Carter A.P. The structure of the dynactin complex and its interaction with dynein.Science. 2015; 347: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the transition from twisted to parallel correlates with small shifts in the relative position of the ICs and larger changes in the position of the LCs: Robl rotates through 25° (Figure S3D), and the LC8/Tctex density moves away from the HC neck (Figure S3E). This suggests that conformational changes in the very N terminus of the HCs can be transmitted over long distances in the tail. The second contact site results from Robl binding to the IC extended N terminus and holding the IC WD40 domains together. Robl is much closer to IC A (Figures 2D and S3D), suggesting it is constrained by connections to the IC WD40 domains. The binding of Robl to both IC N termini is likely to be responsible for orienting the ICs, which are related to each other by a 135° rotation about the long axis of the tail (Figure 2D). The third HC contact site, which has not been described previously, is close to the LICs and involves a direct interaction between HC helical bundles 7 and 8 (Figures 2E and S3F; Movie S4). In a previous negative stain EM study of open-dynein (Chowdhury et al., 2015Chowdhury S. Ketcham S.A. Schroer T.A. Lander G.C. Structural organization of the dynein-dynactin complex bound to microtubules.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the first and second contact sites were identified but the distance between the LICs suggests that the third contact site was not present. This suggests that the LIC-proximal contact site acts to stabilize motor-domain self-dimerization in phi-dynein. A dynein motor domain consists of a linker that is a continuation of the HC neck, a ring of six AAA+ domains, and a coiled-coil stalk that binds to microtubules at its tip. In the phi-dynein structure, the linkers of the two motor domains contact each other in the center of the dimer (Figure 3A). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the motor, which was previously hypothesized to be part of the dimerization interface (Torisawa et al., 2014Torisawa T. Ichikawa M. Furuta A. Saito K. Oiwa K. Kojima H. Toyoshima Y.Y. Furuta K. Autoinhibition and cooperative activation mechanisms of cytoplasmic dynein.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), is on the outside of the motor dimer (Figure 3A). In the phi-particle, the stalks are diametrically opposed to the linker N termini (Figure 3A) and therefore also the tail (Figure 1A). The conformation of the motor domain in phi-dynein is similar to the crystal structure of a related dynein (cytoplasmic dynein-2) trapped in the presence of the ATP hydrolysis transition state analog, ADP.vanadate (ADP.Vi) (Schmidt et al., 2015Schmidt H. Zalyte R. Urnavicius L. Carter A.P. Structure of human cytoplasmic dynein-2 primed for its power stroke.Nature. 2015; 518: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B). The ADP.Vi structure represents the conformation of dynein just before it binds to microtubules and undergoes a powerstroke. The microtubule affinity of dynein is controlled by a sliding of the helices in the stalk coiled coil (Schmidt et al., 2015Schmidt H. Zalyte R. Urnavicius L. Carter A.P. Structure of human cytoplasmic dynein-2 primed for its power stroke.Nature. 2015; 518: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similar to the ADP.Vi structure, our motor domains have their stalks in a low-affinity conformation. In both structures, the stalk helix CC2 forms a bulge near to where it binds to the buttress (Figure 3B). This is in contrast to the crystal structure of dynein-1 in the high-affinity, ADP-bound state (Kon et al., 2012Kon T. Oyama T. Shimo-Kon R. Imamula K. Shima T. Sutoh K. Kurisu G. The 2.8 Å crystal structure of the dynein motor domain.Nature. 2012; 484: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) where the stalk helices form a straight coiled coil (Figure S4A). Previous work proposed that the weak affinity of phi-dynein for microtubules is caused by crossing of the stalks, which prevents the two microtubule binding domains (MTBDs) from binding simultaneously (Torisawa et al., 2014Torisawa T. Ichikawa M. Furuta A. Saito K. Oiwa K. Kojima H. Toyoshima Y.Y. Furuta K. Autoinhibition and cooperative activation mechanisms of cytoplasmic dynein.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Here, we show dimerization has a more fundamental effect on microtubule affinity by locking the motors into a weak affinity state. The AAA1 nucleotide binding site is the main site of ATP hydrolysis in dynein. In the ADP.Vi structure it is closed around the nucleotide with many of its key catalytic residues clustered around the vanadate group, which occupies the position of the ATP γ-phosphate (Figure 3C). Our structure was solved in the presence of ATP, but the density suggests only an ADP is bound in AAA1 (Figures S4B and S4C). Surprisingly, the AAA1 site in phi-dynein is tightly closed, similar to the ADP.Vi structure (Figure 3C). It is different from the more open conformation expected for dynein with ADP in AAA1 (Kon et al., 2012Kon T. Oyama T. Shimo-Kon R. Imamula K. Shima T. Sutoh K. Kurisu G. The 2.8 Å crystal structure of the dynein motor domain.Nature. 2012; 484: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The fact that the active site is closed in the presence of ADP suggests the weak affinity of the motor domains in the phi-particle is stabilized by dimerizatio"

https://openalex.org/W2621853784,"Danielle Posthuma and colleagues report a genome-wide association analysis for insomnia complaints in 113,006 individuals from the UK Biobank that identifies associations with variants near seven genes. They find evidence for sex-specific genetic architectures underlying genetic risk for insomnia and genetic correlations between insomnia complaints and psychiatric and metabolic traits. Persistent insomnia is among the most frequent complaints in general practice. To identify genetic factors for insomnia complaints, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a genome-wide gene-based association study (GWGAS) in 113,006 individuals. We identify three loci and seven genes associated with insomnia complaints, with the associations for one locus and five genes supported by joint analysis with an independent sample (n = 7,565). Our top association (MEIS1, P < 5 × 10−8) has previously been implicated in restless legs syndrome (RLS). Additional analyses favor the hypothesis that MEIS1 exhibits pleiotropy for insomnia and RLS and show that the observed association with insomnia complaints cannot be explained only by the presence of an RLS subgroup within the cases. Sex-specific analyses suggest that there are different genetic architectures between the sexes in addition to shared genetic factors. We show substantial positive genetic correlation of insomnia complaints with internalizing personality traits and metabolic traits and negative correlation with subjective well-being and educational attainment. These findings provide new insight into the genetic architecture of insomnia."

Mutations of human ABCA1 are associated with Tangier disease and familial HDL deficiency. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of human ABCA1 with nominal resolutions of 4.1 Å for the overall structure and 3.9 Å for the massive extracellular domain. The nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) display a nucleotide-free state, while the two transmembrane domains (TMDs) contact each other through a narrow interface in the intracellular leaflet of the membrane. In addition to TMDs and NBDs, two extracellular domains of ABCA1 enclose an elongated hydrophobic tunnel. Structural mapping of dozens of disease-related mutations allows potential interpretation of their diverse pathogenic mechanisms. Structural-based analysis suggests a plausible ""lateral access"" mechanism for ABCA1-mediated lipid export that may be distinct from the conventional alternating-access paradigm."

https://openalex.org/W2623559747,"The emergence of sensory-guided behavior depends on sensorimotor coupling during development. How sensorimotor experience shapes neural processing is unclear. Here, we show that the coupling between motor output and visual feedback is necessary for the functional development of visual processing in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of primary visual cortex (V1) of the mouse. Using a virtual reality system, we reared mice in conditions of normal or random visuomotor coupling. We recorded the activity of identified excitatory and inhibitory L2/3 neurons in response to transient visuomotor mismatches in both groups of mice. Mismatch responses in excitatory neurons were strongly experience dependent and driven by a transient release from inhibition mediated by somatostatin-positive interneurons. These data are consistent with a model in which L2/3 of V1 computes a difference between an inhibitory visual input and an excitatory locomotion-related input, where the balance between these two inputs is finely tuned by visuomotor experience."
https://openalex.org/W2626832796,"The genomes of filamentous fungi contain up to 90 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding diverse secondary metabolites-an enormous reservoir of untapped chemical potential. However, the recalcitrant genetics, cryptic expression, and unculturability of these fungi prevent scientists from systematically exploiting these gene clusters and harvesting their products. As heterologous expression of fungal BGCs is largely limited to the expression of single or partial clusters, we established a scalable process for the expression of large numbers of full-length gene clusters, called FAC-MS. Using fungal artificial chromosomes (FACs) and metabolomic scoring (MS), we screened 56 secondary metabolite BGCs from diverse fungal species for expression in Aspergillus nidulans. We discovered 15 new metabolites and assigned them with confidence to their BGCs. Using the FAC-MS platform, we extensively characterized a new macrolactone, valactamide A, and its hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS). The ability to regularize access to fungal secondary metabolites at an unprecedented scale stands to revitalize drug discovery platforms with renewable sources of natural products."

It remains unclear whether these two feelings can be accurately and differentially predicted from neural activity and to what extent their neural substrates can be distinguished. We developed fMRI markers predicting moment-by-moment intensity levels of care and distress intensity while participants (n = 66) listened to true biographies describing human suffering. Both markers' predictions correlated strongly with self-report in out-of-sample participants (r = 0.59 and r = 0.63, p < 0.00001), and both markers predicted later trial-by-trial charitable donation amounts (p < 0.05). Empathic care was preferentially associated with nucleus accumbens and medial orbitofrontal cortex activity, whereas distress was preferentially associated with premotor and somatosensory cortical activity. In tests of marker specificity with an independent behavioral sample (n = 200), the empathic care marker was associated with a mixed-valence feeling state, whereas the empathic distress marker was specific to negative emotion."

Consistent detection and quantification of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) across sample cohorts is a prerequisite for functional analysis of biological processes. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) is a bottom-up mass spectrometry approach that provides complete information on precursor and fragment ions. However, owing to the convoluted structure of DIA data sets, confident, systematic identification and quantification of peptidoforms has remained challenging. Here, we present inference of peptidoforms (IPF), a fully automated algorithm that uses spectral libraries to query, validate and quantify peptidoforms in DIA data sets. The method was developed on data acquired by the DIA method SWATH-MS and benchmarked using a synthetic phosphopeptide reference data set and phosphopeptide-enriched samples. IPF reduced false site-localization by more than sevenfold compared with previous approaches, while recovering 85.4% of the true signals.

https://openalex.org/W2624703541,"Many viral surface glycoproteins and cell surface receptors are homo-oligomers, and thus can potentially be targeted by geometrically matched homo-oligomers that engage all subunits simultaneously to attain high avidity and/or lock subunits together. The adaptive immune system cannot generally employ this strategy since the individual antibody binding sites are not arranged with appropriate geometry to simultaneously engage multiple sites in a single target homo-oligomer. We describe a general strategy for the computational design of homo-oligomeric protein assemblies with binding functionality precisely matched to homo-oligomeric target sites. In the first step, a small protein is designed that binds a single site on the target. In the second step, the designed protein is assembled into a homo-oligomer such that the designed binding sites are aligned with the target sites. We use this approach to design high-avidity trimeric proteins that bind influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) at its conserved receptor binding site. The designed trimers can both capture and detect HA in a paper-based diagnostic format, neutralizes influenza in cell culture, and completely protects mice when given as a single dose 24 h before or after challenge with influenza."

Using a propeptide strategy to increase cellular uptake of O-phosphotyrosine (pTyr) and its nonhydrolyzable analog 4-phosphomethyl-L-phenylalanine (Pmp), we identified an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA pair that allows site-specific incorporation of both pTyr and Pmp into recombinant proteins in response to the amber stop codon in Escherichia coli in good yields. The X-ray structure of the synthetase reveals a reconfigured substrate-binding site, formed by nonconservative mutations and substantial local structural perturbations. We demonstrate the utility of this method by introducing Pmp into a putative phosphorylation site and determining the affinities of the individual variants for the substrate 3BP2.

Our data, therefore, highlight ITGA7 as a glioblastoma biomarker and candidate therapeutic target. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and frequent form of malignant brain tumor in adults. Its fast growth rate, high invasive potential, and therapy resistance result in a very poor prognosis with a median survival of about 14 months (Johnson and O’Neill, 2012Johnson D.R. O’Neill B.P.

Intense efforts are being made to identify GBM surface molecules and pathways that can be exploited for therapeutic targeting. Due to the heterogeneity of GBM, several surface markers have been proposed to identify GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) (Binda et al., 2012Binda E. Visioli A. Giani F. Lamorte G. Copetti M. Pitter K.L.

These markers seem valid only for subsets of GBM, and no generally accepted universal marker for highly malignant GSCs has been defined yet. Propagation of primary GBM cultures as neurospheres appears to be a valuable tool to identify, characterize, and target GBM-initiating or -propagating cells (Vescovi et al., 2006Vescovi A.L. Galli R. Reynolds B.A. Brain tumour stem cells.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Although a number of studies have exploited these primary tumorigenic cells to increase the understanding of GBM biology, the repertoire of their functional surface molecules has not been systematically explored. Here we generated random antibodies preferentially reacting with primary GSCs as compared to their differentiated, less tumorigenic counterpart. This unbiased approach led to the isolation of an mAb recognizing and blocking integrin α7 (ITGA7) function. Like ITGA3 and ITGA6, ITGA7 binds several laminin isoforms in conjunction with the integrin β1 subunit (ITGB1) (von der Mark et al., 2002von der Mark H. Williams I. Wendler O.

Expression of the alpha7beta1 laminin receptor suppresses melanoma growth and metastatic potential.Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we show that ITGA7 is aberrantly expressed in aggressive gliomas and acts as a key functional receptor in GSCs, allowing for AKT activation and invasion. ITGA7 high-expressing cells from freshly dissociated tumors are enriched in tumor-initiating cells, which exploit this integrin for promoting tumor growth and malignant invasion. Although additional laminin-binding integrins may contribute to increase the GSC aggressiveness, ITGA7 is overexpressed in gliomas from patients with particularly poor survival, and it appears to play a significantly stronger role in tumor progression. To identify novel surface markers expressed in GSCs, we produced an mAbs library using well-characterized (Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2008Ricci-Vitiani L. Pallini R. Larocca L.M. Lombardi D.G. Signore M.

The neurospheres (Figure 1A) expressed high levels of nestin (Figure S1A); contained proliferating (Figures S1B and S1C), self-renewing cells (Figure S1D); and formed highly infiltrative tumors in mouse brains (Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2010Ricci-Vitiani L. Pallini R. Biffoni M. Todaro M. Invernici G. Cenci T. Maira G. Parati E.A. Stassi G. Larocca L.M. De Maria R. Tumour vascularization via endothelial differentiation of glioblastoma stem-like cells.Nature. 2010; 468: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Upon cancer stem cell (CSC) differentiation (Figure 1A), nestin was downregulated, GFAP was induced (Figure S1A), proliferation slowed down (Figures S1B and S1C), and self-renewal capacity was lost (Figure S1D). We immunized BALB/c mice with viable GSC1 cells, and we generated hybridomas by performing three fusions that were directly cloned, summing up in 3,000 wells with 12,000 individual clones. For high-throughput flow cytometric screening, GSC1 neurospheres were labeled with HOECHST 33342, and they were mixed with unlabeled, differentiated isogenic cells and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) labeled with cell tracker Oregon green (Figure 1B). This allowed us to analyze the antibody binding in three different cell populations (Figure 1C). We found antibody surface binding in 28.3% of the samples. To ensure a fast and stringent selection of antibodies preferentially binding on undifferentiated GSCs, but not binding widespread human surface molecules, we chose only hybridomas with no or low affinity toward PBL and a binding ratio undifferentiated/differentiated GSC1 ≥1.8 for further analysis (Figures 1D and 1E). In a rescreening, we confirmed binding in 26 cases. We assumed that we lost functional hybridomas due to genomic instability induced by the fusion. Because of the heterogeneity in GBM, only a few supernatants reacted positively with the majority of GSCs tested. Thus, we concentrated our efforts on six hybridoma clones that recognized at least five additional independent primary GSC cultures (data not shown). To test if spheroid versus isogenic adherent culture influences the expression of the antigens, we compared antibody binding on undifferentiated cells grown in spheres or on a laminin matrix as monolayer (Pollard et al., 2009Pollard S.M. Yoshikawa K. Clarke I.D. Danovi D. Stricker S. Russell R. Bayani J. Head R. Lee M. Bernstein M. et al.Glioma stem cell lines expanded in adherent culture have tumor-specific phenotypes and are suitable for chemical and genetic screens.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 568-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) with in-vitro-differentiated cells. As expected, the binding of all selected antibodies was reduced upon cell differentiation. However, we observed a significant reduction in the binding of four of six antibodies to cells cultivated on laminin, suggesting a major impact of the adhesion status on the expression of the mAb antigens. In contrast, the binding of mAb 2.7A9 and 1.4A12 was like the stem cell marker EphA2, not altered by adhesion (Figure 1F), indicating that their respective antigens might be potential markers for undifferentiated GSCs. Interestingly, both antibodies displayed weak or no binding on conventional ATCC brain tumor cell lines (Figure S1E). Finally, we focused our attention on the hybridoma clone 1.4A12, which showed a more robust binding in a panel of primary GBM lines (Figure S1E). We verified the localization of the antigen on the cell surface of undifferentiated GSCs, its weak expression in differentiated cells, and the correlation with other stem cell markers (Figure 1G). Immunofluorescence analysis of GBM patient samples revealed a general enrichment of the mAb 1.4A12 antigen expression in the area around the vessels (Figures 1H and S1F). In summary, by using this unbiased screening for monoclonal antibodies recognizing surface molecules on GBM cells with a stem-like phenotype, we isolated mAb 1.4A12 that preferentially stains GBM cells in the perivascular regions. To confirm that mAb 1.4A12 binds to less differentiated, potentially more aggressive GBM cells in the tumor bulk, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-assisted cell separation of GFP-transduced cells from xenografts obtained from primary spheroid GBM cultures. In contrast to primary patient-derived tumors, the GFP expression in the xenograft-derived cells ensured the exclusion of debris and potential non-tumor cells from further downstream analysis, thus reducing the experimental bias in the cell-sorting experiments. Tumor cells freshly dissociated from xenografts generated by three different spheroid GBM cultures showed a co-expression of the mAb 1.4A12 antigen and established GBM stem cell surface markers, such as CD44, integrin alpha 6, and EphA2 (Figure 2A). Upon cell sorting, we observed a considerable difference in sphere formation between mAb 1.4A12 dim and bright cells, the latter being far more efficient (Figure 2B). We found that several GSC and proliferation-associated transcripts, such as EphA2, EphA3, FGF1, nestin, MELK1, CDK1, cyclins, and Ki67, were preferentially expressed by the mAb 1.4A12 high-expressing cell fraction. On the contrary, genes known to be upregulated during neuronal differentiation were stronger expressed in cells with low mAb 1.4A12 binding (Figures 2C, S2A, and S2B). These results suggested that cells expressing high levels of the mAb 1.4A12 antigen could have a potentially less differentiated and more aggressive phenotype. Indeed, we observed that mAb 1.4A12 high cells obtained from xenografts of three independent patients grew significantly faster in vitro (Figure 2D), and they contained a significantly higher number of clonogenic cells (Figures 2E and S2C). By performing orthotopic implantations of xenograft-derived sorted cells in a second recipient mouse, we also verified that high antigen-expressing cells grew significantly faster (Figures 2F and 2G) and behaved more aggressively in vivo (Figure 2H). Thus, GBM cells expressing high levels of the mAb 1.4A12 antigen are enriched in aggressive, undifferentiated GSCs. The strong surface binding of mAb 1.4A12 to GSC1 enabled us to biochemically purify and identify the antigen by mass spectrometric analysis. Using immunoprecipitation from cell surface biotinylated GSC1, we determined a molecular weight of ∼100–110 kDa for the mAb 1.4A12 antigen (Figure 3A). We also detected a protein signal at the same molecular weight in silver- and Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Figures 3A and S3A). The bands were excised from the gel, and tandem mass spectrometric analysis was performed. Among the 30 most abundant proteins detected (Table S1), ITGA7 and ITGB1 were the only two surface proteins with high sequence coverage (Figures S3B and S3C). We confirmed that ITGA7 and ITGB1 are co-immunoprecipitated by both 1.4A12 and ITGB1 mAbs (Figure 3B), indicating that mAb 1.4A12 recognized ITGA7, ITGB1, or the heterodimer of both. To prove which protein was the antigen, we transduced murine L929 cells with human ITGA7 cDNA. This resulted in the binding of mAb 1.4A12 on the cell surface (Figure 3C). In contrast, the expression of human ITGB1 cDNA did not lead to mAb binding to L929. We confirmed these data with the human GBM cell line T98G (Figure S3D). Since also the small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ITGA7 (ITGA7-KD) in different GSCs led to a reduction in antibody surface binding (Figure S3E), we assumed that ITGA7 is the surface antigen recognized by mAb 1.4A12 that we thereafter referred to as anti-ITGA7. We then confirmed our FACS results, and we observed the down-modulation of ITGA7 upon differentiation with a commercially available ITGA7 antibody by western blot (Figure S3F). After finding that anti-ITGA7 is specific for the human protein (Figure S3G), we tested if it might also have some biological activity. We generated MCF7 cells stably expressing ITGA7 (Figure 3D), and we found that anti-ITGA7 inhibits the binding of these cells to laminin, the natural substrate of ITGA7, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3E). In conclusion, these results showed that our antibody is not only able to select ITGA7-expressing cells but also blocks ITGA7 function by interfering with the ITGA7-laminin binding. To get a more comprehensive idea about the molecular pathways influenced by ITGA7, we tested for more than 70 (phospho-) proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival in ITGA7 pro- and deficient GSCs by reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) (Marziali et al., 2016Marziali G. Signore M. Buccarelli M. Grande S. Palma A. Biffoni M. Rosi A. D’Alessandris Q.G. Martini M. Larocca L.M. et al.Metabolic/Proteomic Signature Defines Two Glioblastoma Subtypes With Different Clinical Outcome.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 21557Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The RPPA analysis revealed that GSCs obtained from different patients showed marked differences in their basal pathway activation patterns already in the control cells (Figure 3F). To reduce the complexity, we compared the activation of pathways upon ITGA7-KD within the individual GSCs (Figure 3G). In this screening, we found no consistent differences in the activation pattern of proteins playing roles in apoptosis and Wnt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Interestingly, within the MAPKs, only phosphorylated p38 was downregulated upon ITGA7-KD in all cells tested (Figure 3G). Analyzing other pathways, the most robust differences between the control and ITGA7-depleted cells were observed in the analyses of cell cycle-regulating proteins and the phosphorylation states of protein involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway (Figure 3G). Western blot analysis confirmed the RPPA data and showed a decrease of phosphorylated AKT and p38 in cells lacking ITGA7 (Figures 4A and S4A). In addition to the attenuation of steady-state phosphorylation levels, ITGA7-KD was able to reduce AKT activation upon stimulation with laminin (Figure 4A). This inhibition was also observed by using anti-ITGA7 antibody, although it was less effective compared to the genetic depletion. Of note, anti-ITGA7 treatment had only a marginal effect on p38 activity (Figure S4B). Upon ITGA7-KD, we also found reduced levels of phosphorylated, inactive FOXO3a, together with FoxO1, a well-established AKT target protein and regulator of FoxM1 expression. This may explain the low levels of FoxM1 (Figure 4B) and its target genes active in cell-cycle progression, DNA repair, and invasion (Figure 4C) in ITGA7-KD cells. In cells treated with ITGA7 shRNA, a strong upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27/Kip1 as well as a decreased expression of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), polo-like kinase (PLK), and Cyclin B1 (CycB) was observed (Figure 4D). ITGB1 KD led to the same phenotype (Figure 4E). This ruled out off-target effects of the shRNA and further underlined the importance of the ITGA7β1 dimer for cell cycle progression in GSCs. Consequently, in ITGA7-KD cells, the proliferation marker Ki67 was reduced, and cell cycle analysis showed an accumulation of nuclei in G0/1 phase, but no apoptotic nuclei with sub-diploid DNA content (Figure 4F). Because also the activity of caspase 3/7 was not significantly elevated in ITGA7 or ITGB1 KD cells (Figures S4C and S4D), and the RPPA did not detect an increase of apoptosis-related endpoints, our data suggested that genetic neutralization of the ITGA7β1 dimer blocked the cell cycle without inducing apoptosis. These molecular events are in line with the significant growth decline of cells with reduced ITGA7 and ITGB1 expression (Figures 4G and S4E). Likewise, we observed a striking reduction in the clonogenic survival of cells treated with ITGA7 or ITGB1 shRNA by limiting dilution analysis (Figures 4H and S4F). Also pharmacological inhibition of AKT activity interfered with cell growth, which was not the case for p38 inhibition, indicating that the alteration in PI3K/AKT pathway contributed to the growth inhibition observed in ITGA7-KD cells (Figures S4G and S4H). Having confirmed the anti-proliferative effect of neutralizing ITGA7 by shRNA in vitro, we asked whether we could transfer the system into mouse models. When ITGA7 expression was suppressed (Figure S4I), GSC1 generated detectable tumors significantly later, while cells transduced with the control construct contributed to the tumor growth as expected (Figures S4J and S4K). Also by knocking down ITGA7 in GSC83 cells, which express this protein at lower levels (Figure S4I), we detected a significantly reduced growth (Figures S4L–S4N). Mice injected intracranially with cells transduced with a control shRNA construct showed strong bioluminescence signal 3 months post-engraftment (Figure 4I), while mice engrafted with ITGA7-KD cells showed no or very slow tumor growth (Figure 4J), and they survived more than 300 days without displaying any sign of neurological disorder (Figure 4K). These results indicated an important role of ITGA7 in the tumorigenicity of GSCs, suggesting that ITGA7 may represent a potentially valuable target for anti-tumor therapy. After confirming a correlation of ITGA7 mRNA and protein expression (Figure S5A), we analyzed its expression via publicly available databases, and we found a significant trend for increased ITGA7 expression in higher malignant brain tumors (Figures 5A and S5B). Of note, ITGA7 expression in normal human neural progenitor cells (NHNPs) was considerably lower than in GSCs (Figure 5B). These data pointed toward a correlation of ITGA7 expression and the aggressiveness of the tumor. ITGA3 and A6 belong to the same laminin-binding integrin subfamily as ITGA7, and they were described to play crucial roles in brain tumors. Therefore, we analyzed public databases also for their expression in glioma. The Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) dataset for deceased glioma patients (Madhavan et al., 2009Madhavan S. Zenklusen J.C. Kotliarov Y. Sahni H. Fine H.A. Buetow K. Rembrandt: helping personalized medicine become a reality through integrative translational research.Mol. Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) revealed a significant better overall survival probability when tumors expressed lower levels of integrins. Compared to ITGA3 (Figure 5C) and ITGA6 (Figure 5D), the median survival of patients stratified for low ITGA7 expression (Figure 5E) was almost doubled. We further analyzed the expression distribution of tumors with high integrin levels. We found that the majority of patients with high ITGA3 and ITGA6 (85%) also expressed high levels of ITGA7 (Figure 5F). Interestingly, patients showing a co-expression of the three integrins had only a slightly worse outcome when compared to patients overexpressing only ITGA7 (Figure 5G). These data indicated that high expression of ITGA7 could represent a robust correlation marker with brain tumor malignancy. In the most comprehensive low-grade glioma (LGG) expression dataset (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]), a clear population of patients overexpressed ITGA7 (Figure 5H). These had a median survival time of less than one-third compared to the patients with lower ITGA7 levels (Figure 5I). Also in LGG, ITGA7 expression had the strongest correlation with patient outcome when compared to the other two integrins (Figures S5C and S5D). Although ITGA7 levels were particularly elevated in high-grade glioma, patients with tumors expressing relatively lower levels of ITGA7 had a significant survival advantage, even within the GBM datasets from TCGA (Brennan et al., 2013Brennan C.W. Verhaak R.G. McKenna A. Campos B. Noushmehr H. Salama S.R. Zheng S. Chakravarty D. Sanborn J.Z. Berman S.H. et al.TCGA Research NetworkThe somatic genomic landscape of glioblastoma.Cell. 2013; 155: 462-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3052) Google Scholar) and three other extensive gene expression profiling studies, while the GBM patients of the REMBRANDT dataset showed a strong trend (Figure 5J). Interestingly, the TCGA study indicated an elevated ITGA7 expression in GBM with mesenchymal and classical gene expression signature and a significantly lower but heterogeneous expression in the proneural subtype (Figures S5E and S5F). This resulted in a particularly low ITGA7 expression in a subset of patients from the proneural subtype, who showed a significant survival advantage (Figure S5G). In contrast, ITGA6 expression did not significantly correlate with patient outcome in any GBM subtype (Figure S5G). Taken together, these data indicate that glioma patients with low ITGA7 expression have better survival probabilities. It is well established that the ITGA7/β1 dimer binds and co-localizes with laminin in muscle cells (von der Mark et al., 2002von der Mark H. Williams I. Wendler O. Sorokin L. von der Mark K. Pöschl E. Alternative splice variants of alpha 7 beta 1 integrin selectively recognize different laminin isoforms.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6012-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and mediates muscle cell migration (Yao et al., 1996Yao C.C. Ziober B.L. Squillace R.M. Kramer R.H. Alpha7 integrin mediates cell adhesion and migration on specific laminin isoforms.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25598-25603Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We detected a similar co-expression in both GBM neurospheres and tissue by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figures 6A and 6B ). Further we found that GSCs lacking ITGA7 spread much less in matrigel when compared with control cells (Figure S6A). In quantitative laminin invasion assays, we detected a massive reduction of invasion upon KD of ITGA7 (Figure 6C), without a significant reduction in cell number in the time frame of the assay (Figure 6D), suggesting that ITGA7 is a critical mediator of cell spread and invasion of GSCs. Next, we investigated the intracellular pathways involved in integrin signaling. Upon cell seeding on laminin-coated plates, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src were readily phosphorylated at Tyr397 and Tyr416, respectively (Figure S6B). This effect was blunted in ITGA7-KD cells (Figures 6E and S6C), confirming the role for ITGA7 in laminin-induced signaling in GSCs. Interestingly, the ablation of ITGA7 protein not only blocked the activation by exogenous laminin but also strongly reduced constitutive FAK and Src phosphorylation (Figure 6E), which might be induced by the endogenous laminin in the spheres. Taken together, these data suggested that ITGA7 is crucial for proper signaling induced by laminin in GSCs, and they can explain the ablation of the invasive capacity observed in cells knocked down for ITGA7. By quantifying the number of integrin molecules on the cell surface of 13 independent primary GSC cultures, we found that the ITGA7 expression was more robust than ITGA6 and less heterogeneous than ITGA3 (Figures 6F, S6D, and S6E). Interestingly, cells expressing high levels of ITGA7 showed a tendency to express low levels of ITGA6 and vice versa (Figure 6F). Then, we investigated whether the KD of ITGB1 would also interfere with GSC invasion, and we detected a strongly reduced number of GSCs invading the laminin matrix, especially in cells with a complete depletion of ITGB1 (Figures S6F and S6G). The reduced invasiveness in ITGA7-KD cells might be partially attributable to the reduced p38 activity in the KD cells, as SB203580, a widely applied p38 inhibitor, significantly inhibited GSC invasion, while AKT inhibitors did not (Figure S6H). Of note, anti-ITGA7 reduced GSC spreading into the matrigel matrix (Figure S6I), while invasion assays revealed a strong, concentration-dependent inhibition of laminin invasion by the intact antibody and the F(ab) fragments generated from anti-ITGA7 in GSCs (Figures 6G, S6J, and S6K). As expected, the blocking of ITGB1 was even more effective due to the inhibition of all β1-containing integrin dimers. Interestingly, antibodies blocking ITGA3 and ITGA6 (Lath"

In this study, the authors uncover a modality-specific circuit responsible specifically for mechanonociceptive behavior in Drosophila. They show that the escape response to mechanical but not thermal noxious stimuli requires multisensory integration by mechanosensory neurons and neuromodulatory feedback signaling. Nociception is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to encode and process harmful environmental stimuli. Like most animals, Drosophila melanogaster larvae respond to a variety of nociceptive stimuli, including noxious touch and temperature, with stereotyped escape responses through activation of multimodal nociceptors. How behavioral responses to these different modalities are processed and integrated by the downstream network remains poorly understood. By combining trans-synaptic labeling, ultrastructural analysis, calcium imaging, optogenetics and behavioral analyses, we uncovered a circuit specific for mechanonociception but not thermonociception. Notably, integration of mechanosensory input from innocuous and nociceptive sensory neurons is required for robust mechanonociceptive responses. We further show that neurons integrating mechanosensory input facilitate primary nociceptive output by releasing short neuropeptide F, the Drosophila neuropeptide Y homolog. Our findings unveil how integration of somatosensory input and neuropeptide-mediated modulation can produce robust modality-specific escape behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2625521971,"Ubiquitin linkage to cysteine is an unconventional modification targeting protein for degradation. However, the physiological regulation of cysteine ubiquitylation is still mysterious. Here we found that ACAT2, a cellular enzyme converting cholesterol and fatty acid to cholesteryl esters, was ubiquitylated on Cys277 for degradation when the lipid level was low. gp78-Insigs catalysed Lys48-linked polyubiquitylation on this Cys277. A high concentration of cholesterol and fatty acid, however, induced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) that oxidized Cys277, resulting in ACAT2 stabilization and subsequently elevated cholesteryl esters. Furthermore, ACAT2 knockout mice were more susceptible to high-fat diet-associated insulin resistance. By contrast, expression of a constitutively stable form of ACAT2 (C277A) resulted in higher insulin sensitivity. Together, these data indicate that lipid-induced stabilization of ACAT2 ameliorates lipotoxicity from excessive cholesterol and fatty acid. This unconventional cysteine ubiquitylation of ACAT2 constitutes an important mechanism for sensing lipid-overload-induced ROS and fine-tuning lipid homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2626445265,"Aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is widespread in cancer, making the EGFR an important target for therapy. EGFR gene amplification and mutation are common in glioblastoma (GBM), but EGFR inhibition has not been effective in treating this tumor. Here we propose that primary resistance to EGFR inhibition in glioma cells results from a rapid compensatory response to EGFR inhibition that mediates cell survival. We show that in glioma cells expressing either EGFR wild type or the mutant EGFRvIII, EGFR inhibition triggers a rapid adaptive response driven by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secretion, which leads to activation in turn of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Inhibition of this adaptive axis at multiple nodes rendered glioma cells with primary resistance sensitive to EGFR inhibition. Our findings provide a possible explanation for the failures of anti-EGFR therapy in GBM and suggest a new approach to the treatment of EGFR-expressing GBM using a combination of EGFR and TNF inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2621446108,"Genomic modification by sulfur in the form of phosphorothioate (PT) is widespread among prokaryotes, including human pathogens. Apart from its physiological functions, PT sulfur has redox and nucleophilic properties that suggest effects on bacterial fitness in stressful environments. Here we show that PTs are dynamic and labile DNA modifications that cause genomic instability during oxidative stress. In experiments involving isotopic labeling coupled with mass spectrometry, we observed sulfur replacement in PTs at a rate of ∼2% h-1 in unstressed Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Whereas PT levels were unaffected by exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or hypochlorous acid (HOCl), PT turnover increased to 3.8-10% h-1 after HOCl treatment and was unchanged by H2O2, consistent with the repair of HOCl-induced sulfur damage. PT-dependent sensitivity to HOCl extended to cytotoxicity and DNA strand breaks, which occurred at HOCl doses that were orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding doses of H2O2. The genotoxicity of HOCl in PT-containing bacteria suggests reduced fitness in competition with HOCl-producing organisms and during infections in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2623401869,"Protein O-GlcNAcylation is a reversible post-translational modification of serines and threonines on nucleocytoplasmic proteins. It is cycled by the enzymes O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAc hydrolase (O-GlcNAcase or OGA). Genetic approaches in model organisms have revealed that protein O-GlcNAcylation is essential for early embryogenesis. The Drosophila melanogaster gene supersex combs (sxc), which encodes OGT, is a polycomb gene, whose null mutants display homeotic transformations and die at the pharate adult stage. However, the identities of the O-GlcNAcylated proteins involved and the underlying mechanisms linking these phenotypes to embryonic development are poorly understood. Identification of O-GlcNAcylated proteins from biological samples is hampered by the low stoichiometry of this modification and by limited enrichment tools. Using a catalytically inactive bacterial O-GlcNAcase mutant as a substrate trap, we have enriched the O-GlcNAc proteome of the developing Drosophila embryo, identifying, among others, known regulators of Hox genes as candidate conveyors of OGT function during embryonic development."

Their changes in physicochemical characteristics, chemical structures, and maturity were different not only from each other but also from those with addition of bulking agents during composting. Aromaticity in chicken manure composts decreased at first, and then increased whereas that in cattle and swine manure composts increased. Enhanced ammonia volatilization occurred without addition of bulking agents.

https://openalex.org/W2627060047,"In many cancer types, integrin-mediated signaling regulates proliferation, survival and invasion of tumorigenic cells. However, it is still unclear how integrins crosstalk with oncogenes to regulate tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here we show that oncogenic K-RasV12 upregulates α6-integrin expression in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells via activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Fos-related antigen 1-signaling cascade. Activated α6-integrins promoted metastatic capacity and anoikis resistance, and led to perturbed growth of MDCK cysts. Transcriptomic analysis of K-RasV12-transformed MDCK cells also revealed robust downregulation of αV-class integrins. Re-expression of αV-integrin in K-RasV12-transformed MDCK cells synergistically upregulated the expression of Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 and Twist-related protein 1 and triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition leading to induced cell motility and invasion. These results delineate the signaling cascades connecting oncogenic K-RasV12 with α6- and αV-integrin functions to modulate cancer cell survival and tumorigenesis, and reveal new possible strategies to target highly oncogenic K-RasV12 mutants."

Recently, κ-opioid receptor agonist, nalfurafine hydrochloride was approved to treat central pruritus in patients with liver disease in Japan. This study aimed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of nalfurafine hydrochloride on pruritus in chronic liver disease patients. Methods A patient-reported outcome using questionnaire-based methods was used for 41 liver disease patients with or without pruritus symptoms. Nalfurafine hydrochloride (2.5 μg/day) was orally administered to 18 patients suffering from pruritus symptoms and whose current treatment was not effective. The same questionnaires and visual analogue scales (VAS) were repeatedly followed up for the patients for the entire follow-up period, and biochemical analyses were performed to evaluate the safety of the treatment. Results Pruritus completely disappeared in seven of 18 cases, and VAS scores showed a decreasing trend over time from the start of nalfurafine hydrochloride administration in all patients who received the medication. Among 11 patients who were followed up for more than 12 weeks, nine patients showed continuous improvement of symptoms, and this progress was still apparent at ≥20 weeks after starting administration (p < 0.0001). The medication was discontinued in four patients because of progression of primary disease, high cost, oral dryness, and anemia. No significant toxicity was observed on the serum biochemical analyses. Conclusions Nalfurafine hydrochloride contributed to long-term suppression of pruritus without significant safety problems."

https://openalex.org/W2625922353,"Previous studies have suggested that overexpression of the oncogenic protein epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) correlates with endometrial carcinoma progression and ultimately poor survival from disease. To understand the role of EMP2 in the etiology of disease, gene analysis was performed to show transcripts that are reciprocally regulated by EMP2 levels. In particular, EMP2 expression correlates with and helps regulate the expression of several cancer stem cell associated markers including aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1). ALDH expression significantly promotes tumor initiation and correlates with the levels of EMP2 expression in both patient samples and tumor cell lines. As therapy against cancer stem cells in endometrial cancer is lacking, the ability of anti-EMP2 IgG1 therapy to reduce primary and secondary tumor formation using xenograft HEC1A models was determined. Anti-EMP2 IgG1 reduced the expression and activity of ALDH and correspondingly reduced both primary and secondary tumor load. Our results collectively suggest that anti-EMP2 therapy may be a novel method of reducing endometrial cancer stem cells."

In the current report, we describe the first detection of this lineage in Vietnam in May, 2015 in Đắk Nông province. Three subsequent outbreaks caused by genetically related viruses occurred between May-October, 2015 after which the virus was not detected in clinical outbreaks for at least 15 subsequent months. The observed outbreaks affected (in chronological order): cattle in Đắk Nông province, pigs in Đắk Lắk province and Đắk Nông province, and cattle in Ninh Thuận province. The clinical syndromes associated with these outbreaks were consistent with typical FMD in the affected species. Overall attack rate on affected premises was 0.85 in pigs and 0.93 in cattle over the course of the outbreak. Amongst 378 pigs at risk on affected premises, 85 pigs died during the outbreaks; there were no deaths among cattle. The manner in which FMDV/O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d was introduced into Vietnam remains undetermined; however, movement of live cattle is the suspected route.

https://openalex.org/W2625248534,"Monoubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1) is catalyzed mainly by the RNF20/RNF40 complex and erased by multiple deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs). H2Bub1 influences many aspects of chromatin function, including transcription regulation and DNA repair. Cancer cells often display reduced levels of H2Bub1, and this reduction may contribute to cancer progression. The let-7 family of microRNAs (miRNAs) comprises multiple members with reported tumor-suppressive features, whose expression is frequently downregulated in cancer. We now report that let-7b and let-7c can positively regulate cellular H2Bub1 levels. Overexpression of let-7b and let-7c in a variety of non-transformed and cancer-derived cell lines results in H2Bub1 elevation. The positive effect of let-7b and let-7c on H2Bub1 levels is achieved through targeting of multiple mRNAs, coding for distinct components of the H2B deubiquitylation machinery. Specifically, let-7b and let-7c bind directly and inhibit the mRNAs encoding the DUBs USP42 and USP44, and also the mRNA encoding the adapter protein ATXN7L3, which is part of the DUB module of the SAGA complex. RNF20 knockdown (KD) strongly reduces H2Bub1 levels and increases the migration of non-transformed mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer-derived cells. Remarkably, overexpression of let-7b, which partly counteracts the effect of RNF20 KD on H2Bub1 levels, also reverses the pro-migratory effect of RNF20 KD. Likewise, ATXN7L3 KD also increases H2Bub1 levels and reduces cell migration, and this anti-migratory effect is abolished by simultaneous KD of RNF20. Together, our findings uncover a novel function of let-7 miRNAs as regulators of H2B ubiquitylation, suggesting an additional mechanism whereby these miRNAs can exert their tumor-suppressive effects."

FCR and related traits like growth rate (e.g. days to 110 kg-D110) are of high interest for animal breeders, farmers and society due to implications on animal performance, feeding costs and environmental sustainability. The objective of this study was to identify genomic regions associated with FCR and D110 in pigs. A total of 952 terminal line boars, showing an individual variation in FCR, were genotyped using 60K SNP-Chips. Markers were tested for associations with estimated breeding values (EBV) for FCR and D110. For FCR, the largest number of associated SNPs was located on chromosomes 4 (30 SNPs), 1 (25 SNPs), X (15 SNPs) and 6 (12 SNPs). The most prominent genomic regions for D110 were identified on chromosomes 15 (10 SNPs), 1 and 4 (both 9 SNPs). The most significantly associated SNPs for FCR and D110 mapped 129.8 Kb from METTL11B (chromosome 4) and 32Kb from MBD5 (chromosome 15), respectively. A list of positional genes, closest to significantly associated SNPs, was used to identify enriched pathways and biological functions related to the QTL for both traits. A number of candidate genes were significantly overrepresented in pathways of immune cell trafficking, lymphoid tissue structure, organ morphology, endocrine system function, lipid metabolism, and energy production. After resequencing the coding region of selected positional and functional candidate genes, six SNPs were genotyped in a subset of boars. SNPs in PRKDC, SELL, NR2E1 and AKRIC3 showed significant associations with EBVs for FCR/D110. The study revealed a number of chromosomal regions and candidate genes affecting FCR/D110 and pointed to corresponding biological pathways related to lipid metabolism, olfactory reception, and also immunological status."

GPR124 (also known as TEM5/ADGRA2) is an adhesion G protein–coupled receptor family member that plays a pivotal role in brain angiogenesis and in ensuring a tight blood–brain barrier. However, the signaling properties of GPR124 remain poorly defined. Here, we show that ectopic expression of GPR124 promotes cell adhesion, additive to extracellular matrix–dependent effect, coupled with filopodia and lamellipodia formation and an enrichment of a pool of the G protein–coupled receptor at actin-rich cellular protrusions containing VASP, a filopodial marker. Accordingly, GPR124-expressing cells also displayed increased activation of both Rac and Cdc42 GTPases. Mechanistically, we uncover novel direct interactions between endogenous GPR124 and the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors Elmo/Dock and intersectin (ITSN). Small fragments of either Elmo or ITSN1 that bind GPR124 blocked GPR124-induced cell adhesion. In addition, Gβγ interacts with the C-terminal tail of GPR124 and promotes the formation of a GPR124–Elmo complex. Furthermore, GPR124 also promotes the activation of the Elmo–Dock complex, as measured by Elmo phosphorylation on a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue. Interestingly, Elmo and ITSN1 also interact with each other independently of their GPR124-recognition regions. Moreover, endogenous phospho-Elmo and ITSN1 co-localize with GPR124 at lamellipodia of adhering endothelial cells, where GPR124 expression contributes to polarity acquisition during wound healing. Collectively, our results indicate that GPR124 promotes cell adhesion via Elmo–Dock and ITSN.

Interestingly, Elmo and ITSN1 also interact with each other independently of their GPR124-recognition regions. Moreover, endogenous phospho-Elmo and ITSN1 co-localize with GPR124 at lamellipodia of adhering endothelial cells, where GPR124 expression contributes to polarity acquisition during wound healing. Collectively, our results indicate that GPR124 promotes cell adhesion via Elmo–Dock and ITSN. This constitutes a previously unrecognized complex formed of atypical and conventional Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rac and Cdc42 that is putatively involved in GPR124-dependent angiogenic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2627007127,"Isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) catalyzes the post-translational modification of RAB GTPases that contain C-terminal CXC motifs. However, the functional impact of this modification on RAB proteins has not been actively explored. We found that inhibition of ICMT significantly reduced cell migration in vitro and cancer invasion and metastasis in vivo. This role of ICMT was found to be mediated by RAB4A, an essential regulator of the fast recycling of integrin β3. Integrin β3 regulates cell polarity and migration when localized appropriately to the plasma membrane, thereby having an essential role in cancer metastasis. ICMT catalyzed carboxylmethylation is critical for RAB4A activation and interaction with effectors, its localization to endosomes and recycling vesicles, and hence important for RAB4A-dependent integrin β3 recycling to plasma membrane. These findings bring attention to the effects of C-terminal carboxylmethylation on RAB GTPases and provide a rationale for targeting ICMT in the treatment of metastatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2626531489,"SNi-like mechanisms, which involve front-face leaving group departure and nucleophile approach, have been observed experimentally and computationally in chemical and enzymatic substitution at α-glycosyl electrophiles. Since SNi-like, SN1 and SN2 substitution pathways can be energetically comparable, engineered switching could be feasible. Here, engineering of Sulfolobus solfataricus β-glycosidase, which originally catalyzed double SN2 substitution, changed its mode to SNi-like. Destruction of the first SN2 nucleophile through E387Y mutation created a β-stereoselective catalyst for glycoside synthesis from activated substrates, despite lacking a nucleophile. The pH profile, kinetic and mutational analyses, mechanism-based inactivators, X-ray structure and subsequent metadynamics simulations together suggest recruitment of substrates by π-sugar interaction and reveal a quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free-energy landscape for the substitution reaction that is similar to those of natural, SNi-like glycosyltransferases. This observation of a front-face mechanism in a β-glycosyltransfer enzyme highlights that SNi-like pathways may be engineered in catalysts with suitable environments and suggests that 'β-SNi' mechanisms may be feasible for natural glycosyltransfer enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2624120630,"Co-morbid depression is prevalent in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Here we report that monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) plays pathogenic roles in the comorbidity. We found that chronic intermittent hypoxia significantly increased the MAO-A expression in the rat hippocampus and markedly decreased the dendritic length and spine density in the pyramidal neurons with less pre- and post-synaptic proteins. The MAO-A upregulation resulted in increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/serotonin ratio, oxidative stress, leading to NF-κB activation, inflammation and apoptosis. Also, the expression of cytokine-responsive indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) was significantly augmented in hypoxia, resulting in increased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and lowered serotonin level in the hippocampus. Moreover, depressive-like behaviors were observed in the hypoxic rat. Administration of M30, a brain-selective MAO-A inhibitor with iron-chelating properties, prior to hypoxic treatment prevented the aberrant changes in the hippocampus and depressive behavior. In human SH-SY5Y cells expressing MAO-A but not MAO-B, hypoxia significantly increased the MAO-A expression, which was blocked by M30 or clorgyline. Collectively, the MAO-A upregulation induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia plays significant pathogenic role in oxidative stress, inflammation and IDO-1 activation resulting in serotonin depletion and neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2625522558,"Aminopeptidase N (CD13) is a zinc-binding protease that has functional effects on both cancerogenesis and tumor angiogenesis. Since CD13 is an antigen suitable for molecular targeted therapies (e.g. tTF-NGR induced tumor vascular infarction), we evaluated its impact in NSCLC patients, and tested the effects of the CD13-targeted fusion protein tTF-NGR (truncated tissue factor (tTF) containing the NGR motif: asparagine-glycine-arginine) in vivo in nude mice.Expression of both CD13 and CD31 was studied in 270 NSCLC patients by immunohistochemistry. Clinical correlations and prognostic effects of the expression profiles were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, a microarray-based analysis on the basis of the KM plotter database was performed. The in vivo effects of the CD13-targeted fusion protein tTF-NGR on tumor growth were tested in CD1 nude mice carrying A549 lung carcinoma xenotransplants.CD13 expression in tumor endothelial and vessel associated stromal cells was found in 15% of the investigated samples, while expression in tumor cells was observed in 7%. Although no significant prognostic impact was observed in the full NSCLC study cohort, both univariate and multivariate models identified vascular CD13 protein expression to correlate with poor overall survival in stage III and pN2+ NSCLC patients. Microarray-based mRNA analysis for either adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas did not reveal any significant effect. However, the analysis of CD13 mRNA expression for all lung cancer histologies demonstrated a positive prognostic effect. In vivo, systemic application of CD13-targeted tissue factor tTF-NGR significantly reduced CD13+ A549 tumor growth in nude mice.Our results contribute a data basis for prioritizing clinical testing of tTF-NGR and other antitumor molecules targeted by NGR-peptides in NSCLC. Because CD13 expression in NSCLC tissues was found only in a specific subset of NSCLC patients, rigorous pre-therapeutic testing will help to select patients for these studies."
https://openalex.org/W2625950646,"Tinnitus, or phantom sound perception, leads to increased spontaneous neural firing rates and enhanced synchrony in central auditory circuits in animal models. These putative physiologic correlates of tinnitus to date have not been well translated in the brain of the human tinnitus sufferer. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) we recently showed that tinnitus in humans leads to maintained hemodynamic activity in auditory and adjacent, non-auditory cortices. Here we used fNIRS technology to investigate changes in resting state functional connectivity between human auditory and non-auditory brain regions in normal-hearing, bilateral subjective tinnitus and controls before and after auditory stimulation. Hemodynamic activity was monitored over the region of interest (primary auditory cortex) and non-region of interest (adjacent non-auditory cortices) and functional brain connectivity was measured during a 60-second baseline/period of silence before and after a passive auditory challenge consisting of alternating pure tones (750 and 8000Hz), broadband noise and silence. Functional connectivity was measured between all channel-pairs. Prior to stimulation, connectivity of the region of interest to the temporal and fronto-temporal region was decreased in tinnitus participants compared to controls. Overall, connectivity in tinnitus was differentially altered as compared to controls following sound stimulation. Enhanced connectivity was seen in both auditory and non-auditory regions in the tinnitus brain, while controls showed a decrease in connectivity following sound stimulation. In tinnitus, the strength of connectivity was increased between auditory cortex and fronto-temporal, fronto-parietal, temporal, occipito-temporal and occipital cortices. Together these data suggest that central auditory and non-auditory brain regions are modified in tinnitus and that resting functional connectivity measured by fNIRS technology may contribute to conscious phantom sound perception and potentially serve as an objective measure of central neural pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2625269484,"Fishers worldwide operate in an environment of uncertainty and constant change. Their ability to manage risk associated with such uncertainty and subsequently adapt to change is largely a function of individual circumstances, including their access to different fisheries. However, explicit attention to the heterogeneity of fishers' connections to fisheries at the level of the individual has been largely ignored. We illustrate the ubiquitous nature of these connections by constructing a typology of commercial fishers in the state of Maine based on the different fisheries that fishers rely on to sustain their livelihoods and find that there are over 600 combinations. We evaluate the adaptive potential of each strategy, using a set of attributes identified by fisheries experts in the state, and find that only 12% of fishers can be classified as being well positioned to adapt in the face of changing socioeconomic and ecological conditions. Sensitivity to the uneven and heterogeneous capacity of fishers to manage risk and adapt to change is critical to devising effective management strategies that broadly support fishers. This will require greater attention to the social-ecological connectivity of fishers across different jurisdictions."
https://openalex.org/W2625883173,"The APC/C-Cdh1 ubiquitin-ligase complex targets cell cycle regulators for proteosomal degradation and helps prevent tumor development and accumulation of chromosomal aberrations. Replication stress has been proposed to be the main driver of genomic instability in the absence of Cdh1, but the real contribution of APC/C-Cdh1 to efficient replication, especially in normal cells, remains unclear. Here we show that, in primary MEFs, acute depletion or permanent ablation of Cdh1 slowed down replication fork movement and increased origin activity. Partial inhibition of origin firing does not accelerate replication forks, suggesting that fork progression is intrinsically limited in the absence of Cdh1. Moreover, exogenous supply of nucleotide precursors, or ectopic overexpression of RRM2, the regulatory subunit of Ribonucleotide Reductase, restore replication efficiency, indicating that dNTP availability could be impaired upon Cdh1 loss. Indeed, we found reduced dNTP levels in Cdh1-deficient MEFs. Importantly, DNA breakage is also significantly alleviated by increasing intracellular dNTP pools, strongly suggesting that genomic instability is the result of aberrant replication. These observations highlight the relevance of APC/C-Cdh1 activity during G1 to ensure an adequate supply of dNTPs to the replisome, prevent replication stress and the resulting chromosomal breaks and, ultimately, suppress tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2621774274,"Inflammatory responses are elicited through lipid products of phospholipase A2 activity that acts on the membrane phospholipids, including the phosphoinositides, to form the proinflammatory arachidonic acid and, in parallel, the glycerophosphoinositols. Here, we investigate the role of the glycerophosphoinositol in the inflammatory response. We show that it is part of a negative feedback loop that limits proinflammatory and prothrombotic responses in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. This inhibition is exerted both on the signaling cascade initiated by the lipopolysaccharide with the glycerophosphoinositol-dependent decrease in IκB kinase α/β, p38, JNK, and Erk1/2 kinase phosphorylation and at the nuclear level with decreased NF-κB translocation and binding to inflammatory gene promoters. In a model of endotoxemia in the mouse, treatment with glycerophosphoinositol reduced TNF-α synthesis, which supports the concept that glycerophosphoinositol inhibits the de novo synthesis of proinflammatory and prothrombotic compounds and might thus have a role as an endogenous mediator in the resolution of inflammation. As indicated, this effect of glycerophosphoinositol can also be exploited in the treatment of manifestations of severe inflammation by exogenous administration of the compound.

https://openalex.org/W2625453056,"Non-invasive recordings of human brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencelphalography (MEG) are of value for both basic science and clinical applications in sensory, cognitive, and affective neuroscience. Here we introduce a new approach to estimating the intra-cranial sources of EEG/MEG activity measured from extra-cranial sensors. The approach is based on the group lasso, a sparse-prior inverse that has been adapted to take advantage of functionally-defined regions of interest for the definition of physiologically meaningful groups within a functionally-based common space. Detailed simulations using realistic source-geometries and data from a human Visual Evoked Potential experiment demonstrate that the group-lasso method has improved performance over traditional ℓ2 minimum-norm methods. In addition, we show that pooling source estimates across subjects over functionally defined regions of interest results in improvements in the accuracy of source estimates for both the group-lasso and minimum-norm approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2625509239,"To quantify the influence of baseline pain levels on weight change at one-year follow-up in patients attending a National Health Service specialist weight management programme.We compared one-year follow-up weight (body mass) change between patient sub-groups of none-to-mild, moderate, and severe pain at baseline. A mean sub-group difference in weight change of ≥5kg was considered clinically relevant.Of the 141 complete cases, n = 43 (30.5%) reported none-to-mild pain, n = 44 (31.2%) reported moderate pain, and n = 54 (38.3%) reported severe pain. Covariate-adjusted mean weight loss (95%CI) was similar for those with none-to-mild (8.1kg (4.2 to 12.0kg)) and moderate pain (8.3kg (4.9 to 11.7kg). The mean weight loss of 3.0kg (-0.4 to 6.4kg) for the severe pain group was 5.1kg (-0.6 to 10.7, p = 0.08) lower than the none-to-mild pain group and 5.3kg (0.4 to 10.2kg, p = 0.03) lower than the moderate pain group.Patients with severe pain upon entry to a specialist weight management service in England achieve a smaller mean weight loss at one-year follow-up than those with none-to-moderate pain. The magnitude of the difference in mean weight loss was clinically relevant, highlighting the importance of addressing severe persistent pain in obese patients undertaking weight management programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2626413778,"Background Little is known about homeless patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Objectives To compare clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of homeless to non-homeless patients admitted to four ICUs in a large inner-city academic hospital. Methods 63 randomly-selected homeless compared to 63 age-, sex-, and admitting-ICU-matched non-homeless patients. Results Compared to matched non-homeless, homeless patients (average age 48±12 years, 90% male, 87% admitted by ambulance, 56% mechanically ventilated, average APACHE II 17) had similar comorbidities and illness severity except for increased alcohol (70% vs 17%,p<0.001) and illicit drug(46% vs 8%,p<0.001) use and less documented hypertension (16% vs 40%,p = 0.005) or prescription medications (48% vs 67%,p<0.05). Intensity of ICU interventions was similar except for higher thiamine (71% vs 21%,p<0.0001) and nicotine (38% vs 14%,p = 0.004) prescriptions. Homeless patients exhibited significantly lower Glasgow Coma Scores and significantly more bacterial respiratory cultures. Longer durations of antibiotics, vasopressors/inotropes, ventilation, ICU and hospital lengths of stay were not statistically different, but homeless patients had higher hospital mortality (29% vs 8%,p = 0.005). Review of all deaths disclosed that withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy occurred in similar clinical circumstances and proportions in both groups, regardless of family involvement. Using multivariable logistic regression, homelessness did not appear to be an independent predictor of hospital mortality. Conclusions Homeless patients, admitted to ICU matched to non-homeless patients by age and sex (characteristics most commonly used by clinicians), have higher hospital mortality despite similar comorbidities and illness severity. Trends to longer durations of life supports may have contributed to the higher mortality. Additional research is required to validate this higher mortality and develop strategies to improve outcomes in this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W2625955986,"It is challenging to reinforce and toughen thermoset epoxy resins. We describe a slurry-compounding technique to transfer a uniform dispersion of chitin nanowhiskers (CW) in ethanol into an epoxy matrix. The incorporation of the hydrophilic CW reinforces the oil-soluble diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA). The resultant CW/epoxy bionanocomposites were transparent and showed considerably enhanced thermal and mechanical properties with tensile strength, modulus, toughness, and elongation at break being increased by 49%, 16%, 457%, and 250%, with only 2.5 wt.% CW. This improvement in strength and toughness is rare for thermoset epoxy/rigid nanofiller systems. We hypothesize that CW with many free amine groups could function not only as a nanofiller but also as a macromolecular polyamine hardener that participates in epoxy curing. The strong covalent interaction between the filler and the matrix allowed for efficient load transfer across the interfaces, which accounted for the greater strength and toughness."
https://openalex.org/W2625161340,"Ubiquitination tags proteins for different functions within the cell. One of the most abundant and studied ubiquitin modification is the Lys48 polyubiquitin chain that modifies proteins for their destruction by proteasome. In Plasmodium is proposed that post-translational regulation is fundamental for parasite development during its complex life-cycle; thus, the objective of this work was to analyze the ubiquitination during Plasmodium chabaudi intraerythrocytic stages. Ubiquitinated proteins were detected during intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium chabaudi by immunofluorescent microscopy, bidimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) combined with immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. All the studied stages presented protein ubiquitination and Lys48 polyubiquitination with more abundance during the schizont stage. Three ubiquitinated proteins were identified for rings, five for trophozoites and twenty for schizonts. Only proteins detected with a specific anti- Lys48 polyubiquitin antibody were selected for Mass Spectrometry analysis and two of these identified proteins were selected in order to detect the specific amino acid residues where ubiquitin is placed. Ubiquitinated proteins during the ring and trophozoite stages were related with the invasion process and in schizont proteins were related with nucleic acid metabolism, glycolysis and protein biosynthesis. Most of the ubiquitin detection was during the schizont stage and the Lys48 polyubiquitination during this stage was related to proteins that are expected to be abundant during the trophozoite stage. The evidence that these Lys48 polyubiquitinated proteins are tagged for destruction by the proteasome complex suggests that this type of post-translational modification is important in the regulation of protein abundance during the life-cycle and may also contribute to the parasite cell-cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2623639296,"Biogeography plays a significant role in species’ dispersal, and in turn population structure, across the landscape. The North American katydid Neoconocephalus melanorhinus belongs to a genus with high mobility. Unlike other members of the genus, N. melanorhinus is a salt marsh specialist restricted to a narrow corridor along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. In addition, their range crosses at least one known biogeographic barrier and possesses biogeographic characteristics of the stepping-stone as well as the hierarchical island model of dispersal. Using AFLP markers we searched for areas that conform to the predictions of isolation by distance and for areas of non-uniform increases in genetic variance, indicative of isolation by barrier. We found significant genetic differentiation between all twelve sampled sites. Isolation by distance was the predominant pattern of variation across their range. In addition, we saw possible evidence of two biogeographic barriers to gene flow, one at the Atlantic-Gulf divide and the other along the Gulf coast. We also observed a change in body size across the range. Body size, as measured by male hind femur length, correlated closely with latitude, a possible indication of differential selection across the species range."
https://openalex.org/W2626037749,"Repetition suppression refers to a reduction in the cortical response to a novel stimulus that results from repeated presentation of the stimulus. We demonstrate repetition suppression in a well established computational model of cortical plasticity, according to which the relative strengths of lateral inhibitory interactions are modified by Hebbian learning. We present the model as an extension to the traditional account of repetition suppression offered by sharpening theory, which emphasises the contribution of afferent plasticity, by instead attributing the effect primarily to plasticity of intra-cortical circuitry. In support, repetition suppression is shown to emerge in simulations with plasticity enabled only in intra-cortical connections. We show in simulation how an extended ‘inhibitory sharpening theory’ can explain the disruption of repetition suppression reported in studies that include an intermediate phase of exposure to additional novel stimuli composed of features similar to those of the original stimulus. The model suggests a re-interpretation of repetition suppression as a manifestation of the process by which an initially distributed representation of a novel object becomes a more localist representation. Thus, inhibitory sharpening may constitute a more general process by which representation emerges from cortical re-organisation."
