https://openalex.org/W2149828519,"Quantum phase engineering is demonstrated with two techniques that allow the spatial phase distribution of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to be written and read out. A quantum state was designed and produced by optically imprinting a phase pattern onto a BEC of sodium atoms, and matter-wave interferometry with spatially resolved imaging was used to analyze the resultant phase distribution. An appropriate phase imprint created solitons, the first experimental realization of this nonlinear phenomenon in a BEC. The subsequent evolution of these excitations was investigated both experimentally and theoretically."

https://openalex.org/W2079818352,"Protein interaction mapping using large-scale two-hybrid analysis has been proposed as a way to functionally annotate large numbers of uncharacterized proteins predicted by complete genome sequences. This approach was examined in Caenorhabditis elegans, starting with 27 proteins involved in vulval development. The resulting map reveals both known and new potential interactions and provides a functional annotation for approximately 100 uncharacterized gene products. A protein interaction mapping project is now feasible for C. elegans on a genome-wide scale and should contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms in this organism and in human diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1549053710,"Familial expansile osteolysis (FEO, MIM 174810) is a rare, autosomal dominant bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased bone remodelling. The osteolytic lesions, which develop usually in the long bones during early adulthood, show increased osteoblast and osteoclast activity. Our previous linkage studies mapped the gene responsible for FEO to an interval of less than 5 cM between D18S64 and D18S51 on chromosome 18q21.2-21.3 in a large Northern Irish family. The gene encoding receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK; ref. 5), TNFRSF11A, maps to this region. RANK is essential in osteoclast formation. We identified two heterozygous insertion mutations in exon 1 of TNFRSF11A in affected members of four families with FEO or familial Paget disease of bone (PDB). One was a duplication of 18 bases and the other a duplication of 27 bases, both of which affected the signal peptide region of the RANK molecule. Expression of recombinant forms of the mutant RANK proteins revealed perturbations in expression levels and lack of normal cleavage of the signal peptide. Both mutations caused an increase in RANK-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling in vitro, consistent with the presence of an activating mutation."

https://openalex.org/W2062977162,"Leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells, suppresses food intake and promotes weight loss. To assess the action of this hormone on brain reward circuitry, changes in the rewarding effect of lateral hypothalamic stimulation were measured after leptin administration. At five stimulation sites near the fornix, the effectiveness of the rewarding electrical stimulation was enhanced by chronic food restriction and attenuated by intracerebroventricular infusion of leptin. In contrast, the rewarding effect of stimulating neighboring sites was insensitive to chronic food restriction and was enhanced by leptin in three of four cases. These opposing effects of leptin may mirror complementary changes in the rewarding effects of feeding and of competing behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W2060963038,"DNA topoisomerase IIβ is shown to have an unsuspected and critical role in neural development. Neurogenesis was normal in IIβ mutant mice, but motor axons failed to contact skeletal muscles, and sensory axons failed to enter the spinal cord. Despite an absence of innervation, clusters of acetylcholine receptors were concentrated in the central region of skeletal muscles, thereby revealing patterning mechanisms that are autonomous to skeletal muscle. The defects in motor axon growth in IIβ mutant mice resulted in a breathing impairment and death of the pups shortly after birth."
https://openalex.org/W1572198832,"Azoospermia or oligozoospermia due to disruption of spermatogenesis are common causes of human male infertility. We used the technique of spermatogonial transplantation in two infertile mouse strains, Steel (Sl) and dominant white spotting (W), to determine if stem cells from an infertile male were capable of generating spermatogenesis. Transplantation of germ cells from infertile Sl/Sld mutant male mice to infertile W/Wv or Wv/W54 mutant male mice restored fertility to the recipient mice. Thus, transplantation of spermatogonial stem cells from an infertile donor to a permissive testicular environment can restore fertility and result in progeny with the genetic makeup of the infertile donor male."

https://openalex.org/W1948679507,"Infection with Plasmodium falciparum during pregnancy leads to the accumulation of parasite-infected erythrocytes in the placenta, and is associated with excess perinatal mortality, premature delivery and intrauterine growth retardation in the infant, as well as increased maternal mortality and morbidity. P. falciparum can adhere to specific receptors on host cells, an important virulence factor enabling parasites to accumulate in various organs. We report here that most P. falciparum isolates from infected placentae can bind to hyaluronic acid, a newly discovered receptor for parasite adhesion that is present on the placental lining. In laboratory isolates selected for specific high-level adhesion, binding to hyaluronic acid could be inhibited by dodecamer or larger oligosaccharide fragments or polysaccharides, treatment of immobilized receptor with hyaluronidase, or treatment of infected erythrocytes with trypsin. In vitro flow-based assays demonstrated that high levels of adhesion occurred at low wall shear stress, conditions thought to prevail in the placenta. Our findings indicate that adhesion to hyaluronic acid is involved in mediating placental parasite accumulation, thus changing the present understanding of the mechanisms of placental infection, with implications for the development of therapeutic and preventative interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2050337090,"Voltage-gated proton (H+) channels are found in many human and animal tissues and play an important role in cellular defense against acidic stress. However, a molecular identification of these unique ion conductances has so far not been achieved. A 191-amino acid protein is described that, upon heterologous expression, has properties indistinguishable from those of native H+ channels. This protein is generated through alternative splicing of messenger RNA derived from the gene NOH-1 (NADPH oxidase homolog 1, where NADPH is the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)."
https://openalex.org/W2036472425,"The Smad proteins mediate transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling from the transmembrane serine-threonine receptor kinases to the nucleus. The Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) recruits Smad2 to the TGFβ receptors for phosphorylation. The crystal structure of a Smad2 MH2 domain in complex with the Smad-binding domain (SBD) of SARA has been determined at 2.2 angstrom resolution. SARA SBD, in an extended conformation comprising a rigid coil, an α helix, and a β strand, interacts with the β sheet and the three-helix bundle of Smad2. Recognition between the SARA rigid coil and the Smad2 β sheet is essential for specificity, whereas interactions between the SARA β strand and the Smad2 three-helix bundle contribute significantly to binding affinity. Comparison of the structures between Smad2 and a comediator Smad suggests a model for how receptor-regulated Smads are recognized by the type I receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2166765849,"Dorsal and ventral aspects of the eye are distinct from the early stages of development. The developing eye cup grows dorsally, and the choroidal fissure is formed on its ventral side. Retinal axons from the dorsal and ventral retina project to the ventral and dorsal tectum, respectively. Misexpression of the Tbx5 gene induced dorsalization of the ventral side of the eye and altered projections of retinal ganglion cell axons. Thus, Tbx5 is involved in eye morphogenesis and is a topographic determinant of the visual projections between retina and tectum."

https://openalex.org/W2007139173,"Observations have resolved the satellite Charon from its parent planet Pluto, giving separate spectra of the two objects from 1.0 to 2.5 micrometers. The spectrum of Charon is found to be different from that of Pluto, with water ice in crystalline form covering most of the surface of the satellite. In addition, an absorption feature in Charon's spectrum suggests the presence of ammonia ices. Ammonia ice-water ice mixtures have been proposed as the cause of flowlike features observed on the surfaces of many icy satellites. The existence of such ices on Charon may indicate geological activity in the satellite's past."
https://openalex.org/W2015197751,"The reaction of oxygen with protein diiron sites is important in bioorganic syntheses and biomineralization. An unusually short Fe-Fe distance of 2.53 angstroms was found in the diiron (mu-1,2 peroxodiferric) intermediate that forms in the early steps of ferritin biomineralization. This distance suggests the presence of a unique triply bridged structure. The Fe-Fe distances in the mu-1, 2 peroxodiferric complexes that were characterized previously are much longer (3.1 to 4.0 angstroms). The 2.53 angstrom Fe-Fe distance requires a small Fe-O-O angle (approximately 106 degrees to 107 degrees). This geometry should favor decay of the peroxodiferric complex by the release of H2O2 and mu-oxo or mu-hydroxo diferric biomineral precursors rather than by oxidation of the organic substrate. Geometrical differences may thus explain how diiron sites can function either as a substrate (in ferritin biomineralization) or as a cofactor (in O2 activation)."

https://openalex.org/W2046117302,"A diamond nucleation site responsible for epitaxial growth of diamond on silicon by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is identified in high-resolution transmission electron microscopic images. Other sites in the same sample leading to polycrystalline growth, but deleterious to epitaxial CVD growth, are also described. A mechanism for the heteroepitaxial growth of diamond is suggested, in which etching of the nondiamond carbon binder exposes and removes nonadherent nanodiamond nuclei, leaving intact only those directly nucleated on the silicon substrate. This work enhances our understanding of diamond nucleation and heteroepitaxial growth and its potential applications."
https://openalex.org/W2049054981,"A century ago, W. G. MacCallum identified distinct male and female forms in malaria parasites of both birds and humans. Since then, scientists have been puzzled by the high female-to-male ratios of parasites in Plasmodium infections and by the mechanism of sex determination. The sex ratio of malaria parasites was shown to become progressively more male as conditions that allow motility and subsequent fertilization by the male parasites become adverse. This resulted from an increased immune response against male gametes, which coincides with intense host erythropoietic activity. Natural and artificial induction of erythropoiesis in vertebrate hosts provoked a shift toward male parasite production. This change in parasite sex ratio led to reduced reproductive success in the parasite, which suggests that sex determination is adaptive and is regulated by the hematologic state of the host."
https://openalex.org/W2027372330,"Expression of Q205L Galphao (Galphao*), an alpha subunit of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) that lacks guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity in NIH-3T3 cells, results in transformation. Expression of Galphao* in NIH-3T3 cells activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) but not mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases 1 or 2. Coexpression of dominant negative Stat3 inhibited Galphao*-induced transformation of NIH-3T3 cells and activation of endogenous Stat3. Furthermore, Galphao* expression increased activity of the tyrosine kinase c-Src, and the Galphao*-induced activation of Stat3 was blocked by expression of Csk (carboxyl-terminal Src kinase), which inactivates c-Src. The results indicate that Stat3 can function as a downstream effector for Galphao* and mediate its biological effects."
https://openalex.org/W2026679218,"Far-from-equilibrium, spatially extended chaotic systems have generally eluded analytical solution, leading researchers to consider theories based on a statistical rather than a detailed knowledge of the microscopic length scales. Building on the recent discovery of a separation of length scales between macroscopic behavior and microscopic chaos, a simple far-from-equilibrium spatially extended chaotic system has been studied computationally at intermediate, coarse-grained scales. Equilibrium properties such as Gibbs distributions and detailed balance are recovered at these scales, which suggests that the macroscopic behavior of some far-from-equilibrium systems might be understood in terms of equilibrium statistical mechanics."
https://openalex.org/W1597676159,"The fusion glycoproteins of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus type-3 (PIV-3) mediate virus entry and syncytium formation. Interaction between the fusion protein of RSV and RhoA, a small GTPase, facilitates virus-induced syncytium formation. We show here a RhoA-derived peptide inhibits RSV and syncytium formation induced by RSV and PIV-3, both in vitro by inhibition of cell-to-cell fusion and in vivo by reduction of peak titer by 2 log10 in RSV-infected mice. These findings indicate that the interaction between these two paramyxovirus fusion proteins and RhoA is an important target for new antiviral strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2041300648,"Twenty consecutive Very Long Baseline Interferometry images of supernova 1993J from the time of explosion to the present show the dynamic evolution of the expanding radio shell of an exploded star. High-precision astrometry reveals that the supernova expands isotropically from its explosion center. Systematic changes in the images may reflect a pattern of anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the material left over from the progenitor star. As the shock front sweeps up the material in the surrounding medium, it is increasingly decelerated and influenced by the material. After 5 years, the supernova has slowed to half of its original expansion velocity and may have entered the early stages of the adiabatic phase common in much older supernova remnants in the Milky Way Galaxy."

https://openalex.org/W2170961656,"The region bounded by the inner tens of light-years at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy contains five principal components that coexist within the central deep well of gravitational potential. These constituents are a black hole candidate (Sgr A*) with a mass equivalent to 2.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) solar masses, a surrounding cluster of evolved stars, a complex of young stars, molecular and ionized gas clouds, and a powerful supernova-like remnant. The interaction of these components is responsible for many of the phenomena occurring in this complex and unique portion of the Galaxy. Developing a consistent picture of the primary interactions between the components at the Galactic center will improve our understanding of the nature of galactic nuclei in general, and will provide us with a better-defined set of characteristics of black holes. For example, the accretion of stellar winds by Sgr A* appears to produce far less radiation than indicated by estimates based on models of galactic nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1974964510,"The motions of galaxies can be used to constrain the cosmological density parameter Omega and the clustering amplitude of matter on large scales. The mean relative velocity of galaxy pairs, estimated from the Mark III survey, indicates that Omega = 0.35(-0.25)(+0.35). If the clustering of galaxies is unbiased on large scales, Omega = 0. 35 +/- 0.15, so that an unbiased Einstein-de Sitter model (Omega = 1) is inconsistent with the data."
https://openalex.org/W2062952138,"Astronomers believe that the baryon (stellar) halo of the Milky Way retains a fossil imprint of how it was formed. But a vast literature shows that the struggle to interpret the observations within a consistent framework continues. The evidence indicates that the halo has built up through a process of accretion and merging over billions of years, which is still going on at a low level. Future satellite missions to derive three-dimensional space motions and heavy element (metal) abundances for a billion stars will disentangle the existing web and elucidate how galaxies like our own came into existence."
https://openalex.org/W2025773281,"Most of the matter in the Milky Way is invisible to astronomers. Precise numbers are elusive, but it appears that the dark component is 20 times as massive as the visible disk of stars and gas. This dark matter is distributed in space differently than the stars, forming a vast, diffuse halo, more spherical than disklike, which occupies more than 1000 times the volume of the disk of stars. The composition of this dark halo is unknown, but it may comprise a mixture of ancient, degenerate dwarf stars and exotic, hypothetical elementary particles."

https://openalex.org/W1549008804,"Repair of DNA mismatches, and of small insertions and deletions, is a fundamental element of genome stability. In humans, these processes are accomplished by various combinations of two classes of factors, MSH (homologs of bacterial MutS) and MLH (homologs of bacterial MutL), some of which are known as PMS, because certain yeast proteins of this class were originally identified as modifiers of post-meiotic segregation. Mutations in some, but not all, of these factors are strongly correlated with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) and can cause a variety of defects in DNA repair, which can be confined to either mismatch repair, the repair of small insertions and deletions, or both. Deficiencies in the latter process are manifested as microsatellite instability (MSI), a marker for early-onset HNPCC."
