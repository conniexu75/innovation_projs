https://openalex.org/W2025355611,"Strong winter storms in southern California destroyed most of the canopy ofthe giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera but not the patches of understory kelps in the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego. Subsequent massive recruitment of Macrocystis juveniles and adults that survived the storms had low survival in the summer during the California El Ni√±o of 1983. The combined disturbance may have long-lasting structural consequences for this community because, once established, the understory patches can resist invasion by Macrocystis."
https://openalex.org/W1989237030,"Two species of Drosophila that differ in their ecology and mating systems have been compared with respect to male contribution to the somatic tissues and developing oocytes of females. In the species Drosophila mojavensis females remate daily, exhibit a copulatory plug, and have been shown to obtain a contribution from the male ejaculate. In contrast, Drosophila melanogaster males do not contribute to females. Female Drosophila melanogaster do not remate as frequently as Drosophila mojavensis females nor is a copulatory plug formed."
https://openalex.org/W2006177291,"Discovery of 11 genera, in five classes within the Mollusca, Echinodermata, and Arthropoda in upper Eocene rocks on Seymour Island, Antarctica, previously known only from Late Cenozoic in mid-latitudes, suggests that the high latitude region of the Southern Hemisphere acted as a center of origin and dispersal for a broad spectrum of taxa. Precursors to modern deep- and shallow-water mid-latitude forms evolved and flourished in the high latitudes until conditions in lower latitudes favored their dispersal. These observations of Antarctic marine invertebrates corroborate those recently made about terrestrial mammals and plants in the Arctic."

https://openalex.org/W2051171382,"Massive blocks of freshwater ice and frozen sediments protrude from shallow, saline lakes in the Andes of southwestern Bolivia and northeastern Chile. These ice islands range up to 1.5 kilometers long, stand up to 7 meters above the water surface, and may extend out tens of meters and more beneath the unfrozen lake sediments. The upper surfaces of the islands are covered with dry white sediments, mostly aragonite or calcite. The ice blocks may have formed by freezing of the fresh pore water of lake sediments during the ""little ice age."" The largest blocks are melting rapidly because of possibly recent increases in geothermal heat flux through the lake bottom and undercutting by warm saline lake water during the summer."

https://openalex.org/W2130582342,"There is remarkably rich diversity in the cultivated rices and their wild relatives. Substantial segments of the diverse germplasm have been collected and conserved during the past two decades by national, regional, and international research centers. Multidisciplinary and interinstitutional evaluation and use have drawn substantial rewards. However, nations in the developing world that grow and consume rice still face enormous challenges to meet the continuous growth of the human population. Further conservation efforts and improved preservation measures are needed to provide security for the irreplaceable rice germplasm. Modest inputs into conservation programs are highly justified by multibillion dollar returns from the improved varieties in the past two decades."
