https://openalex.org/W3202205923,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) influences cancer progression and therapy response. Therefore, understanding what regulates the TME immune compartment is vital. Here we show that microbiota signals program mononuclear phagocytes in the TME toward immunostimulatory monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that absence of microbiota skews the TME toward pro-tumorigenic macrophages. Mechanistically, we show that microbiota-derived stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists induce type I interferon (IFN-I) production by intratumoral monocytes to regulate macrophage polarization and natural killer (NK) cell-DC crosstalk. Microbiota modulation with a high-fiber diet triggered the intratumoral IFN-I-NK cell-DC axis and improved the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). We validated our findings in individuals with melanoma treated with ICB and showed that the predicted intratumoral IFN-I and immune compositional differences between responder and non-responder individuals can be transferred by fecal microbiota transplantation. Our study uncovers a mechanistic link between the microbiota and the innate TME that can be harnessed to improve cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3204390956,"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes organize genome topology in all kingdoms of life and have been proposed to perform this function by DNA loop extrusion. How this process works is unknown. Here, we have analyzed how loop extrusion is mediated by human cohesin-NIPBL complexes, which enable chromatin folding in interphase cells. We have identified DNA binding sites and large-scale conformational changes that are required for loop extrusion and have determined how these are coordinated. Our results suggest that DNA is translocated by a spontaneous 50 nm-swing of cohesin's hinge, which hands DNA over to the ATPase head of SMC3, where upon binding of ATP, DNA is clamped by NIPBL. During this process, NIPBL ""jumps ship"" from the hinge toward the SMC3 head and might thereby couple the spontaneous hinge swing to ATP-dependent DNA clamping. These results reveal mechanistic principles of how cohesin-NIPBL and possibly other SMC complexes mediate loop extrusion."

The interviews were carried out in March-June (five stages of the research) and in October (the 6th stage of the research). A total of 115 in-depth individual interviews were conducted online with 20 respondents, in 6 stages. The results of the analysis showed that for all respondents the greatest challenges and the source of the greatest suffering were: a) limitation of direct contact with people; b) restrictions on movement and travel; c) necessary changes in active lifestyle; d) boredom and monotony; and e) uncertainty about the future."
https://openalex.org/W3202739595,"The human forebrain has expanded in size and complexity compared to chimpanzees despite limited changes in protein-coding genes, suggesting that gene expression regulation is an important driver of brain evolution. Here, we identify a KRAB-ZFP transcription factor, ZNF558, that is expressed in human but not chimpanzee forebrain neural progenitor cells. ZNF558 evolved as a suppressor of LINE-1 transposons but has been co-opted to regulate a single target, the mitophagy gene SPATA18. ZNF558 plays a role in mitochondrial homeostasis, and loss-of-function experiments in cerebral organoids suggests that ZNF558 influences developmental timing during early human brain development. Expression of ZNF558 is controlled by the size of a variable number tandem repeat that is longer in chimpanzees compared to humans, and variable in the human population. Thus, this work provides mechanistic insight into how a cis-acting structural variation establishes a regulatory network that affects human brain evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3203464869,"The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) regulates feeding- and reward-related behavior, but because of its molecular and anatomical heterogeneity, the functions of defined neuronal populations are largely unclear. Glutamatergic neurons within the LHA (LHAVglut2) negatively regulate feeding and appetitive behavior. However, this population comprises transcriptionally distinct and functionally diverse neurons that project to diverse brain regions, including the lateral habenula (LHb) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). To resolve the function of distinct LHAVglut2 populations, we systematically compared projections to the LHb and VTA using viral tracing, single-cell sequencing, electrophysiology, and in vivo calcium imaging. LHAVglut2 neurons projecting to the LHb or VTA are anatomically, transcriptionally, electrophysiologically, and functionally distinct. While both populations encode appetitive and aversive stimuli, LHb projecting neurons are especially sensitive to satiety state and feeding hormones. These data illuminate the functional heterogeneity of LHAVglut2 neurons, suggesting that reward and aversion are differentially processed in divergent efferent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3203743280,"In aging, androgenic alopecia, and genetic hypotrichosis disorders, hair shaft miniaturization is often associated with hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) loss. However, the mechanism causing this stem cell depletion in vivo remains elusive. Here we show that hair shaft loss or a reduction in diameter shrinks the physical niche size, which results in mechanical compression of HFSCs and their apoptotic loss. Mechanistically, cell compression activates the mechanosensitive channel Piezo1, which triggers calcium influx. This confers tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) sensitivity in a hair-cycle-dependent manner in otherwise resistant HFSCs and induces ectopic apoptosis. Persistent hair shaft miniaturization during aging and genetic hypotrichosis disorders causes long-term HFSC loss by inducing continuous ectopic apoptosis through Piezo1. Our results identify an unconventional role of the inert hair shaft structure as a functional niche component governing HFSC survival and reveal a mechanosensory axis that regulates physical-niche-atrophy-induced stem cell depletion in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3201904462,"Telemedicine has been rapidly adopted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is limited work surrounding demographic and socioeconomic disparities that may exist in telemedicine utilization. This study aimed to examine demographic and socioeconomic differences in surgical patient telemedicine usage during the COVID-19 pandemic.Department of Surgery outpatients seen from July 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020 were stratified into three visit groups: pre-COVID-19 in-person, COVID-19 in-person, or COVID-19 telemedicine. Generalized linear models were used to examine associations of sex, race/ethnicity, Distressed Communities Index (DCI) scores, MyChart activation, and insurance status with telemedicine usage during the COVID-19 pandemic.14,792 patients (median age 60, female [57.0%], non-Hispanic White [76.4%]) contributed to 21,980 visits. Compared to visits before the pandemic, telemedicine visits during COVID-19 were more likely to be with patients from the least socioeconomically distressed communities (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08,1.58; P = 0.005), with an activated MyChart (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.17-1.64; P < .001), and with non-government or commercial insurance (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.84-2.94; P < .001). Adjusted comparison of telemedicine visits to in person visits during COVID-19 revealed telemedicine users were more likely to be female (OR, 1.38, 95% CI, 1.10-1.73; P = 0.005) and pay with non-government or commercial insurance (OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.85-4.16; P < .001).During the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine was more likely utilized by female patients and those without government or commercial insurance compared to patients who used in-person visits. Interventions using telemedicine to improve health care access might consider such differences in utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3206308820,"Rising political polarization in recent decades has hampered and gridlocked policymaking, as well as weakened trust in democratic institutions. These developments have been linked to the idea that new media technology fosters extreme views and political conflict by facilitating self-segregation into “echo chambers” where opinions are isolated and reinforced. This opinion-centered picture has recently been challenged by an emerging political science literature on “affective polarization”, which suggests that current polarization is better understood as driven by partisanship emerging as a strong social identity. Through this lens, politics has become a question of competing social groups rather than differences in policy position. Contrary to the opinion-centered view, this identity-centered perspective has not been subject to dynamical formal modeling, which generally permits hypotheses about micro-level explanations for macro-level phenomena to be systematically tested and explored. We here propose a formal model that links new information technology to affective polarization via social psychological mechanisms of social identity. Our results suggest that new information technology catalyzes affective polarization by lowering search and interaction costs, which shifts the balance between centrifugal and centripetal forces of social identity. We find that the macro-dynamics of social identity is characterized by two stable regimes on the societal level: one fluid regime , in which identities are weak and social connections heterogeneous, and one solid regime in which identities are strong and groups homogeneous. We also find evidence of hysteresis, meaning that a transition into a fragmented state is not readily reversed by again increasing those costs. This suggests that, due to systemic feedback effects, if polarization passes certain tipping points, we may experience run-away political polarization that is highly difficult to reverse."
https://openalex.org/W3203346037,"As a major component of the extracellular matrix, hyaluronan (HA) plays an important role in defining the biochemical and biophysical properties of tissues. In light of the extremely rapid turnover of HA and the impact of this turnover on HA biology, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying HA catabolism is key to understanding the in vivo functions of this unique polysaccharide. Here, we show that TMEM2, a recently identified cell surface hyaluronidase, plays an essential role in systemic HA turnover. Employing induced global Tmem2 knockout mice (Tmem2iKO), we determined the effects of Tmem2 ablation not only on the accumulation of HA in bodily fluids and organs, but also on the process of HA degradation in vivo. Within 3 weeks of tamoxifen-induced Tmem2 ablation, Tmem2iKO mice exhibit pronounced accumulation of HA in circulating blood and various organs, reaching levels as high as 40-fold above levels observed in control mice. Experiments using lymphatic and vascular injection of fluorescent HA tracers demonstrate that ongoing HA degradation in the lymphatic system and the liver is significantly impaired in Tmem2iKO mice. We also show that Tmem2 is strongly expressed in endothelial cells in the subcapsular sinus of lymph nodes and in the liver sinusoid, two primary sites implicated in systemic HA turnover. Our results establish TMEM2 as a physiologically relevant hyaluronidase with an essential role in systemic HA catabolism in vivo, acting primarily on the surface of endothelial cells in the lymph nodes and liver.

Hyaluronan (HA), a member of the family of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), is a long unbranched polysaccharide (as along as 25,000 disaccharide units in length) with a molecular weight reaching as high as 107 Da. HA is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and is also present in biological fluids, such as blood and lymph (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. Hyaluronan.FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 2Hascall V. Esko J.D. Hyaluronan.in: rd Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Stanley P. Hart G.W. Aebi M. Darvill A.G.

Hyaluronan: From extracellular glue to pericellular cue.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). HA is extremely hydrophilic and occupies a large hydrodynamic volume in solution. These unique biochemical and biophysical properties of HA are accompanied and influenced by another unique feature of HA metabolism—an extremely rapid turnover. An estimated one-third of total body HA (∼15 g in a person with a 70 kg body weight) is turned over daily (4Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Turnover and metabolism of hyaluronan.Ciba Found. Symp. 1989; 143 (discussion 53-49, 281-285): 41-53PubMed Google Scholar), and the metabolic half-life of HA in skin is only 1–1.5 days (5Stern R. Devising a pathway for hyaluronan catabolism: Are we there yet?.Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 105R-115RCrossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This is in stark contrast to half-lives of other ECM molecules in tissues, many of which have half-lives measured in months or years (6Price R.G. Spiro R.G.

Degradation of HA is thought to be a multistep process. The widely accepted, although not thoroughly tested, model proposes that HA in the extracellular space is first partially degraded into intermediate-sized HA fragments by an extracellular or cell surface hyaluronidase (9Stern R. Jedrzejas M.J. Hyaluronidases: Their genomics, structures, and mechanisms of action.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 818-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Subsequently, these intermediate-sized HA species are internalized and further degraded by hyaluronidase(s) in endosomes and lysosomes. These smaller HA fragments are ultimately degraded by lysosomal exoglucosidases into monosaccharides, which are then recycled for the production of new glycans or for glycolysis (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. Hyaluronan.FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). On the systemic level, these stages of HA degradation do not necessarily occur in a single cell type. While some of the HA released from the ECM of peripheral tissues is taken up and metabolized by local cells, the bulk of released HA flows into lymphatic vessels and is transported into the lymphatic nodes, where the majority of degradation occurs (10Fraser J.R. Kimpton W.G. Laurent T.C. Cahill R.N. Vakakis N. Uptake and degradation of hyaluronan in lymphatic tissue.Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, HA present in blood plasma is primarily taken up and degraded by the liver (4Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Turnover and metabolism of hyaluronan.Ciba Found. Symp. 1989; 143 (discussion 53-49, 281-285): 41-53PubMed Google Scholar). Five major proteins are known to function in HA degradation in mammalian tissues, namely HYAL1, HYAL2, SPAM1 (also known as PH-20), HYBID (Hyaluronan Binding Protein Involved in Hyaluronan Depolymerization; also known as KIAA1199 and CEMIP), and TMEM2 (Transmembrane protein 2; also known as CEMIP2) (11Yamaguchi Y. Yamamoto H. Tobisawa Y. Irie F. TMEM2: A missing link in hyaluronan catabolism identified?.Matrix Biol. 2019; 78-79: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sharing high levels of sequence homology, HYAL1, HYAL2, and SPAM1 constitute a protein family whose members are thought to have been generated by gene duplication (12Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. The six hyaluronidase-like genes in the human and mouse genomes.Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). SPAM1, the first identified member of the family, is predominantly expressed in the testis (13Cherr G.N. Yudin A.I. Overstreet J.W. The dual functions of GPI-anchored PH-20: Hyaluronidase and intracellular signaling.Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). HYAL1 was originally purified from human plasma as a 57 kDa protein (14Frost G.I. Csoka A.B. Wong T. Stern R. Purification, cloning, and expression of human plasma hyaluronidase.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), while HYAL2 was identified by cDNA cloning based on sequence homology with SPAM1 (15Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G.

While HYAL2 was originally identified in lysosomes of glioma cells (15Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G.

While the bulk of SPAM1 is present in the acrosome, a lysosome-related organelle of sperm cells (20Moreno R.D. Alvarado C.P. The mammalian acrosome as a secretory lysosome: New and old evidence.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2006; 73: 1430-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), SPAM1 can also be anchored on the cell surface via a GPI linkage (13Cherr G.N. Yudin A.I. Overstreet J.W.

The pH optima for the hyaluronidase activities of HYAL1 and HYAL2 are both distinctly acidic (15Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G.

SPAM1 exhibits dual pH optima at acidic and neutral ranges (22Cherr G.N. Meyers S.A. Yudin A.I. VandeVoort C.A. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Overstreet J.W.

Biol. 2015; 842: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). HYBID and TMEM2 constitute a family of proteins independent of the HYAL family. HYBID was originally identified as a secretory protein that has HA binding activity (24Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A. Tobiishi M. Kawabata K. Sayo T. Sakai S. Sugiyama Y. Enomoto H. Okada Y. Inoue S. KIAA1199, a deafness gene of unknown function, is a new hyaluronan binding protein involved in hyaluronan depolymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: 5612-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Transfection with HYBID confers HEK293 cells with the ability to degrade HA, while knockdown of HYBID inhibits the endogenous HA degrading activity of Detroit 511 fibroblasts (24Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A. Tobiishi M. Kawabata K. Sayo T. Sakai S. Sugiyama Y. Enomoto H. Okada Y. Inoue S.

Curiously, however, neither conditioned media of HYBID-transfected cells nor recombinant HYBID protein exhibits intrinsic HA degrading activity (24Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A.

Instead, HYBID-mediated HA degradation requires participation of the clathrin-coated pit pathway (24Yoshida H. Nagaoka A. Kusaka-Kikushima A. Tobiishi M. Kawabata K. Sayo T. Sakai S. Sugiyama Y. Enomoto H. Okada Y. Inoue S. KIAA1199, a deafness gene of unknown function, is a new hyaluronan binding protein involved in hyaluronan depolymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: 5612-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), suggesting that HYBID itself might not be a hyaluronidase per se. TMEM2 was originally identified as one of more than 300 different human open reading frames that are grouped together based only on the presence of at least one putative transmembrane domain (26Wrzesinski T. Szelag M. Cieslikowski W.A. Ida A. Giles R. Zodro E. Szumska J. Pozniak J. Kwias Z. Bluyssen H.A. Wesoly J. Expression of pre-selected TMEMs with predicted ER localization as potential classifiers of ccRCC tumors.BMC Cancer. 2015; 15: 518Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The observations that TMEM2 has sequence similarity with HYBID, and that zebrafish tmem2 mutants exhibit excessive HA accumulation in developing heart (27Smith K.A. Lagendijk A.K. Courtney A.D. Chen H. Paterson S. Hogan B.M. Wicking C. Bakkers J. Transmembrane protein 2 (Tmem2) is required to regionally restrict atrioventricular canal boundary and endocardial cushion development.Development. 2011; 138: 4193-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggested to us that TMEM2 might be an unidentified cell surface hyaluronidase. Subsequently, we demonstrated that TMEM2 is a type II transmembrane protein that has intrinsic hyaluronidase activity at neutral pH (28Yamamoto H. Tobisawa Y. Inubushi T. Irie F. Ohyama C. Yamaguchi Y. A mammalian homolog of the zebrafish Transmembrane Protein 2 (TMEM2) is the long-sought-after cell surface hyaluronidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 7304-7313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that endogenous TMEM2 degrades substrate-immobilized HA in a contact-dependent manner, further supporting the notion that it acts as a cell surface hyaluronidase (29Irie F. Tobisawa Y. Murao A. Yamamoto H. Ohyama C. Yamaguchi Y. The cell surface hyaluronidase TMEM2 regulates cell adhesion and migration via degradation of hyaluronan at focal adhesion sites.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296100481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). TMEM2 is expressed widely in adult mouse tissues, including the lymph nodes and liver (28Yamamoto H. Tobisawa Y. Inubushi T. Irie F. Ohyama C. Yamaguchi Y. A mammalian homolog of the zebrafish Transmembrane Protein 2 (TMEM2) is the long-sought-after cell surface hyaluronidase.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 7304-7313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the tissues primarily implicated in systemic HA catabolism. In this study, we use conditional Tmem2 knockout mice to investigate the functional significance of TMEM2 in systemic HA catabolism. Seeking to define a specific role for TMEM2 in physiological HA catabolism, we have induced global Tmem2 ablation in adult mice. These knockout mice have allowed us to demonstrate a rapid accumulation of HA in bodily fluids and organs during a short window of time following the induction of Tmem2 ablation, as well as deleterious effects of Tmem2 ablation on ongoing degradation of HA in the vascular and lymphatic systems. Moreover, we show that TMEM2 is expressed in the endothelial cells in the lymph nodes and liver, two predominant sites implicated in systemic HA turnover. Overall, our results establish that TMEM2 is a physiological hyaluronidase that plays an essential role in systemic HA catabolism in vivo. To define the physiological significance of TMEM2 in systemic HA catabolism, we generated inducible Tmem2 knockout mice using a floxed Tmem2 allele (Tmem2flox; Fig. S1, A–D) and the CAG-CreER transgene. CAG-CreER is ubiquitously active, tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver (30Hayashi S. McMahon A.P. Efficient recombination in diverse tissues by a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre: A tool for temporally regulated gene activation/inactivation in the mouse.Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). An important advantage of this inducible global knockout system is that it allows investigation of the effect of Tmem2 ablation on current, ongoing systemic HA catabolism. In contrast, models using constitutive knockout of hyaluronidase genes to assess the consequence of loss of enzyme activity must inevitably reflect the long-term accumulation of HA in the tissues and blood, including even the embryonic and early postnatal periods of life. HA accumulation in constitutive knockout models could thus be a long-term, indirect consequence of gene ablation, rather than the direct consequence of loss of the targeted gene on current HA metabolism. Inducible gene ablation avoids these intrinsic shortcomings of constitutive knockout models and importantly, allows determination of the time course of HA accumulation shortly after the induction of gene ablation. CAG-CreER;Tmem2flox/flox mice at 6 weeks of age were treated with tamoxifen (0.125 mg/g body weight/day, i.p., for 5 consecutive days) to induce global Tmem2 ablation (hereafter, these mice will be referred to as Tmem2iKO mice). As controls, Tmem2flox/flox mice were treated with tamoxifen in the same manner (hereafter, these mice will be referred to as control mice). Knockout efficiency in Tmem2iKO mice as analyzed by TaqMan qPCR was 76% and 61% in the liver and lymph nodes, respectively (Fig. S1E). These levels of knockout efficiency are comparable to other values reported using the same CAG-CreER system (31Du F. Nguyen M.V. Karten A. Felice C.A. Mandel G. Ballas N.

At day 12 and day 19 after the treatment (the day of the final [fifth] tamoxifen injection is designated as day 0), mice were euthanized, and tissues and blood were collected for the analysis of HA. Tmem2iKO mice exhibit rapid and massive accumulation of HA in blood. The blood HA level in Tmem2iKO mice was 832 ± 63 ng/ml at day 12 and 7452 ± 1943 ng/ml at day 19, values that are 4.7 and 40.5 times higher than those seen in control mice at the respective time points (Fig. 1A and Table S1). Agarose-gel electrophoresis with the Stains-All dye (38Cowman M.K. Chen C.C. Pandya M. Yuan H. Ramkishun D. LoBello J. Bhilocha S. Russell-Puleri S. Skendaj E. Mijovic J. Jing W. Improved agarose gel electrophoresis method and molecular mass calculation for high molecular mass hyaluronan.Anal. Biochem. 2011; 417: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was used to further characterize the nature of HA in blood (Fig. 1B). This assay reveals that high molecular weight (HMW) bands of ∼1000 kDa (Fig. 1B, arrowheads in lanes 5 and 6) are present in Tmem2iKO mice but not in control mice (lane 4). These HMW bands in Tmem2iKO mice completely disappear following treatment with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 9 and 10), indicating that they indeed represent HA. Thus, in Tmem2iKO mice, not only the HA content of circulating blood is markedly increased, but this circulating HA population contains a significant amount of undigested HMW HA species. HA accumulation in tissues was examined by biochemical HA quantification and by tissue HA staining in Tmem2iKO and control mice at day 19. The HA content in lymph nodes in Tmem2iKO mice is 861 ± 86 pg/ng DNA at day 19, which is 4.1 times higher than the level in control mice (210 ± 35 pg/ng DNA) (Fig. 1C and Table S2). Likewise, tissue HA contents are increased by 8.3-, 3.4-, and 2.2-fold in the liver, lung, and kidney, respectively, in Tmem2iKO mice (Fig. 1C and Table S2). Deposition of HA was examined by tissue staining with the biotinylated HABP (HA-binding protein) probe in the four organs mentioned above, as well as in the skin and bone marrow. All these organs in Tmem2iKO mice exhibit varying degrees of increased HA deposition (Fig. 2). In lymph nodes of Tmem2iKO mice, the stromal components, most notably the subcapsular sinus, exhibit prominent HA deposition (Fig. 2A). In the liver, HA deposition is observed along the liver sinusoid (Fig. 2B). In other organs and tissues examined, HA deposition is prominent in the alveolar wall of the lung (Fig. 2C), the mesangium of the kidney (Fig. 2D), the dermis (Fig. 2E), and the bone marrow matrix (Fig. 2F). These increases in HA in blood and tissues are not due to enhanced expression of HA synthases in Tmem2iKO mice, as qPCR analyses reveal no differences in their expression levels between Tmem2iKO and control mice (Fig. S2). Expression of two major HA-binding proteins, namely CD44 and Lyve1, was not altered in Tmem2iKO mice, either. Lymph nodes and liver have been implicated as key sites in systemic HA turnover (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. Hyaluronan.FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar, 10Fraser J.R. Kimpton W.G. Laurent T.C. Cahill R.N. Vakakis N. Uptake and degradation of hyaluronan in lymphatic tissue.Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The rapid accumulation of HA in blood and lymph nodes observed in Tmem2iKO mice is consistent with the notion that TMEM2 plays a physiologically relevant role in systemic HA catabolism. We therefore used the RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) technique to examine Tmem2 mRNA expression patterns in the lymph nodes and liver. In lymph node of wild-type mice, strong Tmem2 expression is detected primarily at sites corresponding to stromal components (Fig. 3, A and B). Tmem2 expression is particularly robust in cells of the subcapsular sinus (S), whereas signals are negligible in the lymphoid follicles (F). Since lymphatic endothelial cells have been implicated as the cell type primarily responsible for HA degradation in the lymphatic system (10Fraser J.R. Kimpton W.G. Laurent T.C. Cahill R.N.

The lymphatics revisited: New perspectives from the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we used magnetic cell sorting to isolate CD31-positive endothelial cells and CD31-negative nonendothelial cells from lymph nodes and analyzed Tmem2 expression by absolute quantification RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 3C, CD31-positive cells express Tmem2 much more strongly than CD31-negative cells. Together with the RNAscope ISH results, these results demonstrate that endothelial cells in lymph nodes, in particular those in the subcapsular sinus, are the primary site of Tmem2 expression. In the liver, Tmem2 mRNA is detected in cells that are regularly aligned along the liver sinusoid, while hepatocytes exhibit no Tmem2 expression (Fig. 3D). This pattern of mRNA distribution suggests that Tmem2 is expressed in the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. This is consistent with a single-cell RNAseq data set (40Lotto J. Drissler S. Cullum R.

To further confirm Tmem2 expression in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, we performed an RNAscope ISH/CD31 immunohistochemistry double-labeling experiment. Results of this analysis show that Tmem2 mRNA signals are associated with CD31-positive endothelial cells lining the liver sinusoids (Fig. 3E). Our results demonstrating HA accumulation in the wake of Tmem2 ablation strongly support the physiological significance of TMEM2 in systemic HA catabolism. Nevertheless, the accumulation of HA is an indirect measure of HA catabolism and does not directly establish the physiological significance of a given hyaluronidase molecule in the ongoing process of HA degradation. Therefore, we employed in vivo injection of fluoresceinamine-labeled HA (FA-HA) (41Jadin L. Bookbinder L.H. Frost G.I. A comprehensive model of hyaluronan turnover in the mouse.Matrix Biol. 2012; 31: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to define the effect of Tmem2 ablation on the short-term dynamics of HA degradation. First, we examined the time course of lymphatic degradation of FA-HA injected into the peripheral tissue of wild-type mice. Right hindlimb paws of 10-week-old wild-type C57Bl/6 mice were injected with 15 μl of FA-HA (100–300 kDa, 1 μg/μl in PBS). At 1 or 16 h after injection, the popliteal lymph nodes were removed for analysis of HA degradation by gel filtration of tissue extracts. This analysis demonstrates that there is little degradation of FA-HA after 1 h (Fig. 4A, upper panel), but that FA-HA is almost completely degraded"

We have reported that CCL11 is significantly increased in the serum of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, colonic eosinophils are increased and correlate with tissue CCL11 levels in ulcerative colitis patients, and CCL11 is increased in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis. Here, we show that CCL11 is involved in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced colitis and in colon tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC). Ccl11−/− mice exposed to DSS then allowed to recover had significantly less body weight loss and a decrease in histologic injury versus wild-type (WT) mice. In the AOM-DSS model, Ccl11−/− mice exhibited decreased colonic tumor number and burden, histologic injury, and colonic eosinophil infiltration versus WT mice. Ccl11 is expressed by both colonic epithelial and lamina propria immune cells. Studies in bone marrow chimera mice revealed that hematopoietic- and epithelial-cell-derived CCL11 were both important for tumorigenesis in the AOM-DSS model. These findings indicate that CCL11 is important in the regulation of colitis and associated carcinogenesis and thus anti-CCL11 antibodies may be useful for treatment and cancer chemoprevention in IBD."

Neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTLD) are characterized by the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord (1Taylor J.P.

In these neural disorders, two RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), TDP-43 (43 kDa TAR DNA-binding protein) and FUS (fused in sarcoma), have been reported as the common causative gene products, of which modulations lead to a gain of functional toxicity or a loss of normal protein function (3Arai T.

Even though the characterization of mutants and the analysis of proteinaceous inclusions have provided important clues for elucidation how these gene products are connected with the diseases, the molecular mechanisms of ALS and FTLD remain unclear. Along this line, one important issue is that these two proteins specifically bind to mRNA containing G-quadruplex (G4) and transport to distal neurites for local translation (7Fujii R. Okabe S.

Recently, we reported that ALS-linked mutations of TDP-43 are less active than wild-type in binding with G4-RNAs (9Ishiguro A. Kimura N. Noma T. Shimo-Kon R. Ishihama A. Kon T.

These results suggested that the altered interaction between G4-RNAs and mutant proteins is somehow connected with the pathogenesis of ALS and FTLD.On a noncanonical higher-order DNA/RNA structure, G4 is composed of two or more guanine tetrads, which associate through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding leading to form a square planar structure (10Sen D.

Moore P.B. Tetramerization of an RNA oligonucleotide containing a GGGG sequence.Nature. 1991; 351: 331-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). G4 plays essential roles in telomere function, gene expression, and intracellular mRNA transport, and thus its dysfunction leads to cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (12Varshney D. Spiegel J.

Recently, it has been anticipated that such noncanonical RNA structures are involved in the formation of RNA granules by liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) (13Roden C. Gladfelter A.S.

The N-terminal proximal half of FUS is composed of one QGSY-rich region and one Gly-rich domain while its C-terminal proximal half contains a single RRM (RNA recognition motif), two RGG (Arg/Gly-rich) domains interposed by a Zn finger, and a C-terminal Pro/Tyr-rich region (PY-CTR) including nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal QGSY-rich region, one RGG region, and the C-terminal two RGG regions are the disordered low-complexity (LC) regions in the FUS protein sequence and are considered to mediate LLPS (25Hofweber M.

These findings altogether indicate that multiple modules of FUS influence the formation or disassembly of RNP compartments. However, the contribution of LLPS to the formation and regulation of RNP compartments carries the risk because RBPs with LC regions tend to aggregate (1Taylor J.P. Brown Jr., R.H. Cleveland D.W.

Since the aberrant phase separation of G4-binding proteins such as FUS and TDP-43 is considered to link with neurodegeneration, it is critically important to understand in details how the RNA structure promotes, inhibits, and/or tunes the phase separation of associated proteins. Up to the present time, however, the molecular mechanism of the sequential phase behavior of ALS-linked FUS in LLPS and liquid-to-solid transition (LST) remains elusive.The purpose of this study is to clarify how FUS-G4-RNA interactions contribute to LLPS and/or LST and whether ALS-linked FUS mutations affect their phase behavior. For this purpose, we constructed an in vitro system for observation of the formation and phase transition of FUS RNP condensates using the purified full-length wild-type and mutant FUS proteins and a set of FUS-binding target RNAs. Results herein described clearly indicated that FUS forms specific complexes with target RNAs in G4 structure-dependent manner and exhibits transformation through LLPS and LST pathways. In this process, multiple modules of FUS protein are involved. Noteworthy is that ALS-linked amino acid mutations gave marked alteration in the G4-dependent formation of FUS condensates and their phase separation and transition.ResultsFormation of the FUS condensatesIn general, the phase-separating proteins with LC regions such as FUS are often aggregation-prone, and thus the purification of full-length intact proteins is difficult due to phase separation or aggregation (29Alberti S. Mateju D. Mediani L. Carra S. Granulostasis: Protein quality control of RNP granules.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2017; 10: 84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, several methods have been taken by production of test proteins as fusion proteins and/or by adding macromolecular crowding agents such as dextran, poly-ethylene glycol, or Ficoll. In the case of FUS, however, the fusion proteins often exhibit a wide range of nonspecific nucleic-acid-binding ability (26Wang X. Schwartz J.C. Cech T.R. Nucleic acid-binding specificity of human FUS protein.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 7535-7543Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Schwartz J.C. Wang X. Podell E.R. Cech T.R. RNA seeds higher-order assembly of FUS protein.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 918-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, the treatment of fusion proteins with protease to remove the tag protein quickly induces LLPS, and thus experiments must be conducted using mixtures of different protein states. Recently, however, we succeeded to purify the full-length tag-free human FUS in soluble form (Fig. 1B) (31Ishiguro A. Katayama A. Ishihama A. Different recognition modes of G-quadruplex RNA between two ALS/FTLD-linked proteins TDP-43 and FUS.FEBS Lett. 2021; 595: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). At the final purification step, FUS was prepared in a storage buffer containing β-cyclodextrin (βCD), a cyclic oligosaccharide, consisting of a macrocyclic ring of glucose subunits and forming hydrophobic cavities. Protein aggregation is prevented mainly through the temporary weak inclusion of the exposed aromatic residues into the hydrophobic cavity of βCD (32Aachmann F.L. Otzen D.E. Larsen K.L. Wimmer R. Structural background of cyclodextrin-protein interactions.Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Starting from this purified FUS, we first tried to form FUS condensates lacking the surrounding membrane. The level of FUS condensate formation promoted with increase of FUS concentration (Figs. 1C and S1). The purified FUS at the physiological cellular concentration of 2 μM immediately formed protein condensates with an average diameter of about 2 μm, which are equal in size as intracellular condensates (Fig. 1D) (22Patel A. Lee H.O. Jawerth L. Maharana S. Jahnel M. Hein M.Y. Stoynov S. Mahamid J. Saha S. Franzmann T.M. Pozniakovski A. Poser I. Maghelli N. Royer L.A.

Tomancak P. et al.RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins.Science. 2018; 360: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Fusions of droplets were frequently observed at concentrations 16 μM and above (Figs. 1C and S2). Using this system of in vitro formation of FUS condensates, we next tried to examine possible influence of G4-RNA binding on the condensate formation.G4-RNA promotes the formation of FUS condensatesThe purified FUS protein binds to G4-containing DNA/RNAs under structure-dependent manner and induces the deformation of G4 structure using its multiple RNA-binding modules for stable binding (31Ishiguro A. Katayama A. Ishihama A. Different recognition modes of G-quadruplex RNA between two ALS/FTLD-linked proteins TDP-43 and FUS.FEBS Lett. 2021; 595: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). First we confirmed the structure of G4-RNAs used for this assay using CD (circular dichroism) spectroscopy analysis. As the model G4-RNAs, we used human PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein 95) and CaMKIIα (Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit alpha) mRNAs, which carry G4s from 3′-untranslated region of dendritic mRNAs (34Subramanian M. Rage F. Tabet R. Flatter E. Mandel J.L. Moine H. G-quadruplex RNA structure as a signal for neurite mRNA targeting.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the presence of 150 mM NaCl, both of the model G4-RNAs formed the typical parallel-stranded G4, which exhibited CD spectra with positive peak around 265 nm and negative peak around 240 nm compared in the absence of salt (Fig. 2, A and B).Figure 2G4-RNA promotes the formation of FUS condensates. A and B, CD spectrum of model G4-RNAs. Two species of G4-RNA (PSD-94 and CaMKIIα) were subjected to CD spectroscopic analysis in the presence (NaCl) and absence (Control) of Na+. The CD spectrum has a positive peak near 265 nm and a negative peak near 245 nm, both of which are characteristic of the parallel stranded G4-RNA structure. PSD-95 G4 contains four-A-loop between the first and second G triplet. C, influence of G4-RNAs on the formation of FUS condensates. Purified FUS protein (2 μM) was mixed with each of G4-RNAs or a reference randomized RNA (n20), and the level of FUS condensate formation was determined by measuring the turbidity. The graph shows the turbidity value of FUS solution in the presence of increasing RNA concentrations. The turbidity (y-axis) represents the average of three independent experiments together with ±SEM values. In the absence of protein, no condensate was observed. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t test ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001. Representative images of the phase-contrast microscopy are shown for each. Scale bar represents 20 μm. D, FUS condensates were formed in the presence of terminal fluorescent-labeled G4 RNAs (2 μM). FUS condensates formed were observed with fluorescent microscopy. Using the same concentration of BSA (2 μM), no fluorescent signal was detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then analyzed the formation of FUS condensates in the presence of various concentrations of these model G4-RNAs. As a control, a randomized RNA (synthesized oligomer of mixed sequence composition) was used to compare and measure the formation of FUS condensates (Fig. 2C). Both G4 RNAs significantly promoted the formation of condensates compared with random RNA controls at concentrations 2 μM and above. No condensate formation was observed without FUS even at the highest concentrations of RNAs. Randomized RNA had a slight effect on condensate formation, supposedly due to nonspecific interactions with phosphate backbone, RNA bases of unstructured RNA, and/or G4-like sequence (35Tauber D. Tauber G. Parker R. Mechanisms and regulation of RNA condensation in RNP granule formation.Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2020; 45: 764-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fluorescently labeled G4-RNAs were included in the FUS condensates, but no fluorescence signal was detected when an equal amount of BSA (bovine serum albumin) was added as a control (Fig. 2D). These results strongly endorse the prediction that the FUS condensates are formed through the LLPS process, and this process is promoted in the presence of G4-RNA.To get insights into the molecular basis of LLPS promotion, we next examined whether this effect depends on either G4 structure or G-rich sequence. To discriminate these two possibilities, we performed the condensate formation assay using two well-analyzed sequences, whose structures change depending on monovalent salt species. Recently, we identified that FUS binds to human telomere DNA forming hybrid type G4 in the presence of KCl, but not to the unfolded DNA by replacing to NaCl (Fig. 3A; (31Ishiguro A. Katayama A. Ishihama A. Different recognition modes of G-quadruplex RNA between two ALS/FTLD-linked proteins TDP-43 and FUS.FEBS Lett. 2021; 595: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar)). FUS also binds with both parallel-stranded G4 and G-rich hairpin structures that were formed by (G4C2)4, a hexanucleotide repeat expansion RNA transcribed within the ALS-related C9orf72 gene (Fig. 3B; (31Ishiguro A. Katayama A. Ishihama A. Different recognition modes of G-quadruplex RNA between two ALS/FTLD-linked proteins TDP-43 and FUS.FEBS Lett. 2021; 595: 310-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar)). Although (G4C2)4 forms both structures in the presence of KCl, but only the hairpin structure by replacement of KCl to NaCl (Fig. 3B; (36Grigg J.C. Shumayrikh N. Sen D. G-guadruplex structures formed by expanded hexanucleotide repeat RNA and DNA from the neurodegenerative disease-linked C9orf72 gene efficiently sequester and activate heme.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e10.1371Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Haeusler A.R.

C9ord72 nucleotide repeat structures initiate molecular cascades of diseases.Nature. 2014; 507: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar)). Neither telomere DNA nor (G4C2)4 affected the formation of FUS condensate in the NaCl-containing buffer (Fig. 3C and S3). These observations indicate that FUS binds to the hairpin structure but the FUS condensate formation is not promoted with FUS-hairpin complexes. Conversely, both telomere DNA and (G4C2)4 RNA significantly promoted the condensate formation of FUS in the presence of 150 mM KCl-containing buffer, in which the G4 structure is formed (Fig. 3C). Thus we concluded that the FUS condensation is promoted when FUS binds to G4-forming DNA/RNA.Figure 3G4 structure is required for promotion of FUS condensation. A, conformational alteration of telomere DNA. Telomere DNA was subjected to CD spectroscopic analysis in the presence of NaCl or KCl. Telomere DNA is known to form different conformations in the presence of KCl and NaCl (82Zhang X.Y. Cao E.H. Zhang Y. Chou C. Bai C. K+ and Na+-induced self-assembly of telomeric oligonucleotide d(TTAGGG)n.J. Biomol. Struc. Dynam. 2003; 20: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum shows a positive peak near 290 nm and a negative peak near 235 nm in the presence of 150 mM KCl, both of which are characteristic of hybrid-type G4 structure. It is, however, converted into unfolded form at 150 mM NaCl. B, conformational alteration of (G4C2)4-RNA. (G4C2)4-RNA exists in equilibrium between hairpin and parallel G4 conformations at 150 mM KCl, but is converted into hairpin structure at 150 mM NaCl (31Ishiguro A. Katayama A. Ishihama A.

C, G4 structure-dependent promotion of FUS condensation. The turbidity of FUS solution (2 μM) after incubation with 2 μM of telomere DNA or (G4C2)4. The average values of turbidity and ±SEM values were measured after three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t test ∗∗∗p < 0.001.

https://openalex.org/W3207803392,"We investigate the effect of board gender diversity on managerial risk-taking incentives. Our results demonstrate that companies with stronger board gender diversity provide more powerful executive risk-taking incentives. It appears that female directors' risk aversion exacerbates managers' risk aversion, resulting in a sub-optimal level of risk-taking. To offset this tendency for too little risk, companies are induced to provide stronger risk-taking incentives. Specifically, an increase in board gender diversity by one standard deviation raises vega by 10.3%. Further analysis corroborates the results, including propensity score matching, entropy balancing, and an instrumental-variable analysis. Endogeneity appears to be unlikely, suggesting that female directors are not merely associated with, but probably bring about stronger risk-taking incentives."
https://openalex.org/W3207440484,"Malaria is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, and children are especially vulnerable. In 2019, an estimated 409,000 people died of malaria, most (274,000) were young children and 94% of the cases and deaths were in Africa. Prior studies in Ethiopia focused on the adult population and high transmission areas. Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of malaria in children under five years in low transmission areas.A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 585 under-five children who attended public health facilities in the Wogera district from September to October, 2017. Health facilities were selected by stratified cluster sampling, and systematic random sampling was held to select study participants from the selected facilities. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify correlates of malaria.Of 585 children who provided blood samples, 51 (8.7%) had malaria. The predominant Plasmodium species were P. falciparum 33 (65%) and P. vivax 18 (35%). Regularly sleeping under long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLIN) was associated with decreased odds of malaria (AOR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.09), and an increased odds of malaria was observed among children who live in households with stagnant water in the compound (AOR = 6.7, 95% CI: 3.6-12.6) and children who stay outdoors during the night (AOR = 5.5, 95% CI: 2.7-11.1).The prevalence of malaria in the study population was high. Environmental and behavioral factors related to LLIN use remain potential determinants of malaria. Continued public health interventions targeting proper utilization of bed nets, drainage of stagnant water, and improved public awareness about reducing the risk of insect bites have the potential to minimize the prevalence of malaria and improve the health of children."

This research investigated the quantity and types of tourism resources and analyzed the spatial patterns of tourism resources on Hainan Island from the perspectives of spatial variation and spatial association. The spatial and temporal pattern of the number of tourists and tourism revenue during 2010–2019 were further analyzed. The influencing factors of tourism development were explored based on the geographic detector. The results showed that 10425 tourism resources exist on Hainan Island, and the type of buildings and facilities had the largest number of tourism resources. The geological landscape, astronomical phenomena and meteorological landscapes, buildings and facilities, ruins and remains, tourism commodities, and human activities showed significant spatial agglomeration. Domestic tourism was far more developed than inbound tourism in terms of the number of tourists and tourism revenue. However, the spatial difference of tourism resources and tourism economy was apparent on Hainan Island. Factor analysis showed that the quantity of hotels, the proportion of tertiary industry in the GDP, and the regional population were the most influential factors for the distribution of tourism resources, while the density of the road network, the quantity of hotels, the per capita GDP, the proportion of tertiary industry in GDP, the regional population, and the quantity of tourism resources showed obvious influences on the tourism economy of Hainan Island. Interactions of the factors mainly fell into three types: synergistic increases, single factor weakening, and nonlinear weakening. It is suggested that the local government should fully exploit diversity types of tourism resources on Hainan Island to attract more tourists and improve the tourism revenue; improving the inbound tourism, and to strengthen the construction of road network on Hainan Island."
https://openalex.org/W3201689811,"Neural circuits often exhibit sequences of activity, but the contribution of local networks to their generation remains unclear. In the zebra finch, song-related premotor sequences within HVC may result from some combination of local connectivity and long-range thalamic inputs from nucleus uvaeformis (Uva). Because lesions to either structure abolish song, we examine ""sleep replay"" using high-density recording methods to reconstruct precise song-related events. Replay activity persists after the upstream nucleus interfacialis of the nidopallium is lesioned and slows when HVC is cooled, demonstrating that HVC provides temporal structure for these events. To further gauge the importance of intra-HVC connectivity for shaping network dynamics, we lesion Uva during sleep and find that residual replay sequences could span syllable boundaries, supporting a model in which HVC can propagate sequences throughout the duration of the song. Our results highlight the power of studying offline activity to investigate behaviorally relevant circuit organization."

Although genetic effects on yolk and albumen contents have been reported, the number of chicken genotypes analyzed so far is still limited. To investigate the effect of genetic background on 10 egg traits, 19 yolk amino acid traits, and 19 albumen amino acid traits, we evaluated a total of 58 eggs from five genotypes: two Japanese indigenous breeds (Ukokkei and Nagoya) and three hybrids (Araucana cross, Kurohisui, and Boris Brown) under a floor rearing system. One-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of genotype on 10 egg traits, 8 yolk amino acids (Asp, Glu, Ser, Gly, Thr, Tyr, Cys, and Leu), and 11 albumen amino acids (Asp, Glu, Asn, Ser, Gln, His, Ala, Tyr, Trp, Phe, and Ile) contents. Moderate to strong positive phenotypic correlations among traits within each trait category (size and weight traits, yolk amino acid traits, and albumen amino acid traits), whereas there were basically no or weak correlations among the trait categories. However, a unique feature was found in the Araucana cross indicating moderate positive correlations of amino acids between yolk and albumen. These results suggest that genetic factors can modify not only the size and weight of the egg and eggshell color but also yolk and albumen free amino acids contents."

CMD prevalence was 40% in the whole area and 80% in Prachinburi, 43% in Sakaeo, 37% in Burium, 25% in Surin, and 19% in Sisaket provinces. Disease incidence of CMD was highest 43.08% in Sakaeo, followed by 26.78% in Prachinburi, 7% in Burium, 2.58% in Surin, and 1.25% in Sisaket provinces. Disease severity of CMD symptoms was mild chlorosis to moderate mosaic (2-3). The greatest disease severity was recorded in Prachinburi and Sakaeo provinces. Asymptomatic plants were identified in Surin (12%), Prachinburi (5%), Sakaeo (0.2%), and Buriram (0.1%) by PCR analysis. Cassava cultivars CMR-89 and Huai Bong 80 were susceptible to CMD. In 95% of cases, the infection was transmitted by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci), which were abundant in Sakaeo, Buriram, and Prachinburi but were sparse in Surin; their densities were highest in May and June 2019. Nucleotide sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (mtCO1) gene of whiteflies in Thailand revealed that it was similar to the mtCO1 gene of Asia II 1 whitefly. Furthermore, the AV1 gene of SLCMV-which encodes the capsid protein-showed 90% nucleotide identity with SLCMV. Phylogenetic analysis of completed nucleotide sequences of DNA-A and DNA-B components of the SLCMV genome determined by rolling circle amplification (RCA) indicated that they were similar to the nucleotide sequence of SLCMV isolates from Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. These results provide important insights into the distribution, impact, and spread of CMD and SLCMV in Thailand."

Collaborative research efforts have enabled investigators to respond to the demands of an increasingly complex 21st century landscape, including pressing scientific challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A major contributing factor to the success of team science is the mobilization of core facilities and shared research resources (SRRs), the scientific instrumentation and expertise that exist within research organizations that enable widespread access to advanced technologies for trainees, faculty, and staff. For over 40 years, SRRs have played a key role in accelerating biomedical research discoveries, yet a national strategy that addresses how to leverage these resources to enhance team science and achieve shared scientific goals is noticeably absent. We believe a national strategy for biomedical SRRs-led by the National Institutes of Health-is crucial to advance key national initiatives, enable long-term research efficiency, and provide a solid foundation for the next generation of scientists."

In plants, it is not known how the C-6 hydroxylation of demethoxyubiquinone, the penultimate step in ubiquinone biosynthesis, is catalyzed. The combination of cross-species gene network modeling along with mining of embryo-defective mutant databases of Arabidopsis thaliana identified the embryo lethal locus EMB2421 (At1g24340) as a top candidate for the missing plant demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase. In marked contrast with prototypical eukaryotic demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylases, the catalytic mechanism of which depends on a carboxylate-bridged di-iron domain, At1g24340 is homologous to FAD-dependent oxidoreductases that instead use NAD(P)H as an electron donor. Complementation assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli demonstrated that At1g24340 encodes a functional demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase and that the enzyme displays strict specificity for the C-6 position of the benzoquinone ring. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy also showed that GFP-tagged At1g24340 is targeted to mitochondria.

This engineering approach, however, is contingent upon the knowledge of the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway and its regulation in plants. Ubiquinone is made up of prenyl and benzoquinone moieties (Fig. 1).

By contrast, nothing is known in plants about the other ring decoration steps, including decarboxylation and hydroxylation at the C-1 position and hydroxylation at the C-6 position. The C6-hydroxylation, which represents the penultimate step in ubiquinone biosynthesis, is of specific interest because it has been shown in other eukaryotes to control the flux of ubiquinone production and to be subjected to posttranslational regulations (17Padilla S.

In metazoans, yeast, and some bacteria, the corresponding enzyme is an O2-dependent carboxylate-bridged diiron protein called Coq7 (EC 1.14.99.60; Fig. 1), also known as clk-1 or CAT5, which uses demethoxyubiquinone as a cosubstrate (20Marbois B.N.

Land plants and green algae lack homologs of this enzyme. Escherichia coli does not possess a Coq7 homolog either, but has instead a catalytically equivalent—though structurally unrelated—FAD-dependent monooxygenase called UbiF (Fig. 1; (24Young I.G. McCann L.M. Stroobant P. Gibson F.

Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 769-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). E. coli also has two additional FAD-dependent monooxygenases, called UbiH (EC 1.14.99.B5) and UbiI (EC 1.14.13.240), which catalyze the C-1 and C-5 hydroxylations, respectively (25Nakahigashi K. Miyamoto K. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H.

However, this framework of dedicated monooxygenases for each reaction of hydroxylation in ubiquinone biosynthesis is not universal as many bacteria have evolved enzymes that catalyze more than one hydroxylation on the benzenoid ring; these include atypical O2-independent hydroxylases as well as bifunctional (C-1/C-5 hydroxylations) or even trifunctional (C-1/C-5/C-6 hydroxylations) FAD-dependent monooxygenases (23Pelosi L.

Barras F. et al.Ubiquinone biosynthesis over the entire O2 range: Characterization of a conserved O2-independent pathway.mBio. 2019; 10e01319-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Such an evolutionary precedent for the existence of nonregioselective FAD-dependent monooxygenases is significant because Arabidopsis encodes an FAD-dependent monooxygenase, COQ6 (At3g24200), which complements a yeast ubiquinone biosynthetic mutant lacking C-5 hydroxylase activity (Fig. 1; (16Hayashi K. Ogiyama Y. Yokomi K. Nakagawa T. Kaino T. Kawamukai M. Functional conservation of coenzyme Q biosynthetic genes among yeasts, plants, and humans.PLoS One. 2014; 9e99038Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Given the absence of Coq7 homologs in plants, the question arises as to whether this Arabidopsis COQ6 could also hydroxylate the C-1 and C-6 ring positions. The identification of plant ubiquinone biosynthetic genes corresponding to the ring decoration steps has historically been achieved via homology searches and complementation of cognate null mutants in yeast (4Okada K. Ohara K. Yazaki K. Nozaki K. Uchida N. Kawamukai M. Nojiri H. Yamane H. The AtPPT1 gene encoding 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyl diphosphate transferase in ubiquinone biosynthesis is required for embryo development in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Mol.

Ogiyama Y. Yokomi K. Nakagawa T. Kaino T. Kawamukai M. Functional conservation of coenzyme Q biosynthetic genes among yeasts, plants, and humans.PLoS One. 2014; 9e99038Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yet, applying this strategy to search for the missing plant C-6 hydroxylase is not straightforward. Indeed, not only are COQ7 homologs absent from plant genomes, but in yeast the presence of the Coq7 protein is required for the stability of other enzymes and proteins involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis (28Tran U.C. Marbois B. Gin P. Gulmezian M. Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Complementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae coq7 mutants by mitochondrial targeting of the Escherichia coli UbiF polypeptide: Two functions of yeast Coq7 polypeptide in coenzyme Q biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16401-16409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because the missing plant C-6 hydroxylase is necessarily a non-Coq7 homolog, it appears unlikely that this enzyme would meet the structural requirements for the functional replacement of Coq7 in yeast complementation assays. In this study, we deploy parallel complementation strategies designed to mitigate the shortcomings of structural compatibility between plant monooxygenase candidates and the hydroxylation of demethoxyubiquinone in yeast and E. coli. Having shown that Arabidopsis COQ6 behaves as a strict C-5 hydroxylase in complementation assays, we combine phenotypic and gene coexpression data mining to identify the authentic plant demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase. To determine whether the Arabidopsis FAD-dependent COQ6 monooxygenase doubles as the enzyme responsible for the hydroxylation at the C-6 position of ubiquinone's ring, its full-length cDNA was subcloned into yeast expression vector pYES-DEST52 and introduced into yeast strain E194KCoq7. This strain harbors a missense mutation that affects the diiron center of Coq7; the E194KCoq7 cells therefore lack Coq7 activity and are devoid of ubiquinone (28Tran U.C. Marbois B. Gin P. Gulmezian M. Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Complementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae coq7 mutants by mitochondrial targeting of the Escherichia coli UbiF polypeptide: Two functions of yeast Coq7 polypeptide in coenzyme Q biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16401-16409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unlike the coq7 null mutant, however, the E194KCoq7 strain still produces the coq7 polypeptide, which despite being catalytically inactive retains the capacity to stabilize other ubiquinone biosynthetic proteins (28Tran U.C. Marbois B. Gin P. Gulmezian M. Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Complementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae coq7 mutants by mitochondrial targeting of the Escherichia coli UbiF polypeptide: Two functions of yeast Coq7 polypeptide in coenzyme Q biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16401-16409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Such an arrangement is notable as it allows the E194KCoq7 mutant to accumulate demethoxyubiquinone, the substrate of the Coq7-catalyzed reaction, and facilitates functional complementation by structurally unrelated FAD-dependent monooxygenases (28Tran U.C. Marbois B. Gin P. Gulmezian M. Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Complementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae coq7 mutants by mitochondrial targeting of the Escherichia coli UbiF polypeptide: Two functions of yeast Coq7 polypeptide in coenzyme Q biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16401-16409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Yet, HPLC analyses showed that the extract of E194KCoq7 cells expressing Arabidopsis COQ6 did not contain detectable amount of ubiquinone (Fig. 2A). As expected, no complementation was observed in the cells harboring empty pYES-DEST52, while expression of wild-type Coq7 restored ubiquinone biosynthesis (Fig. 2A). To confirm these results, the Arabidopsis COQ6 cDNA was cloned without its targeting presequence-encoding region into expression vector pBAD24 and introduced into the E. coli null mutants corresponding to FAD-dependent monooxygenases UbiI, UbiH, and UbiF. As expected here again, HPLC analyses of bacterial extracts indicated that expression of Arabidopsis COQ6 in the ΔubiIc mutant resulted in the restoration of ubiquinone production and near complete disappearance of the early ubiquinone biosynthetic intermediate, octaprenyl phenol (Fig. 2B). In contrast, either marginal or no restoration of ubiquinone production was observed for the ΔubiH and ΔubiF null mutants, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). Together these results demonstrate that Arabidopsis COQ6 does not moonlight as a demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase, and therefore that plants must possess a separate enzyme to catalyze the hydroxylation at the C-6 position of the benzoquinone ring. We hypothesized that the gene encoding plant demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase should fit the criteria classically observed for ubiquinone biosynthetic genes: i) its loss of function should result in the absence of ubiquinone and therefore cause embryo lethality, and ii) its coexpression network should display some functional connections with the respiratory chain. Searching a recently updated dataset of known embryo-defective mutants (510 genes) in Arabidopsis (29Meinke D.W. Genome-wide identification of EMBRYO-DEFECTIVE (EMB) genes required for growth and development in Arabidopsis.New Phytol. 2020; 226: 306-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using the term “hydroxylase” identified a single entry, EMB2421 (At1g24340), annotated as “polyketide hydroxylase-related monooxygenase.” Neither At1g24340 nor any of its plant orthologs have a known cellular function. Since the EMB2421 locus was identified via a single untagged T-DNA insertion (30Meinke D. Sweeney C. Muralla R. Integrating the genetic and physical maps of Arabidopsis thaliana: Identification of mapped alleles of cloned essential (EMB) genes.PLoS One. 2009; 4e7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), two additional T-DNA lines corresponding to independent insertions in At1g24340's first intron (SALK_073461C and SALK_084134) were examined. For both lines about 25% of the segregating seeds in the siliques of the self-pollinated heterozygous plants were indeed aborted and no homozygous mutant could be recovered (Fig. S1). Cross-species analyses of the coexpression profiles of At1g24340 and its orthologs in Medicago, soybean, rice, and tomato indicated that a number of respiratory genes were repeatedly detected among the top 0.8 to 1.2% expressed loci of each cognate database (Fig. 3A; Dataset S1). Most remarkable among these tightly coregulated genes were ubiquinone biosynthetic genes themselves, including COQ6 (soybean, Medicago, rice), COQ9 (Arabidopsis, Tomato, rice), COQ8 (Arabidopsis, Medicago), COQ10 (soybean), COQ5 (Tomato), COQ3 and COQ1 (rice) (Fig. 3A). We consequently deemed At1g24340 as a strong candidate for the missing plant demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase. At1g24340 encodes for a 709 amino acid protein (∼78 kDa) that possesses a conserved FAD/NAD(P)H binding domain (InterPro 002938; residues 47–421) (Fig. 3, B and C). This domain is found in a number of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases that use NAD(P)H as an electron donor and O2 as a cosubstrate, including the UbiF/UbiH/UbiI/COQ6 monooxygenases (Fig. 3, B and C). At1g24340, however, markedly differs from these proteins in that it features an additional unintegrated region (residues 518–709) resulting in a protein that is 23 to 36 kDa larger than these other monooxygenases (Fig. 3, B and C). Structure modeling predicted that At1g24340's unintegrated region folds as a thioredoxin domain (Fig. 3C); the latter, however, lacks the canonical CXXC motif. The closest At1g24340 homologs of known function are bacterial hydroxylases involved in the catabolism of halogenated aromatic compounds; we will return to this topic later. At1g24340 and its orthologs sampled among vascular plants display highly divergent N-terminal extensions of 22 to 48 residues that are characteristic of organelle targeting sequences (Fig. 4A). DeepLoc-1.0 (31Almagro Armenteros J.J. Sønderby C.K. Sønderby S.K. Nielsen H. Winther O.

Legeai F. Lurin C. Predotar: A tool for rapidly screening proteomes for N-terminal targeting sequences.Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) analyses gave high probability (>80%) for localization of At1g24340 to the mitochondrion (Table S1), and a high-throughput proteomics study detected At1g24340's signature peptides in purified leaf mitochondria (33Senkler J. Senkler M. Eubel H. Hildebrandt T. Lengwenus C. Schertl P. Schwarzländer M. Wagner S. Wittig I. Braun H.P. The mitochondrial complexome of Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant J. 2017; 89: 1079-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast, the output of a Wolf Psort (34Horton P. Park K.J. Obayashi T. Fujita N. Harada H. Adams-Collier C.J. Nakai K. WoLF PSORT: Protein localization predictor.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W585-W587Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar) analysis indicated that ten of At1g24340's top 14 nearest neighbors were localized in the chloroplast, one was cytosolic, and only three were mitochondrial (Table S1). IPSORT predicted At1g24340 as having a chloroplast transit peptide (Table S1). To disambiguate the subcellular localization of At1g24340, its full-length cDNA—minus its stop codon (Table S2)—was fused in-frame to the 5′-end of GFP, and this construct was coinfiltrated with an RFP-tagged mitochondrial marker in Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy showed that both fluorescent reporter proteins imaged as discrete punctate structures that moved quickly along cytosolic streams as typically observed for mitochondria (Fig. 4, B, C, and E). Strict overlap of the GFP and RFP signals was observed in cells that coexpressed the corresponding fusion proteins, while no GFP-associated fluorescence was observed in plastids (Fig. 4, D and E). At1g24340 appears therefore to be targeted exclusively to mitochondria. Expression of At1g24340's full-length cDNA into the yeast E194KCoq7 point mutant restored the ability of these cells to utilize nonfermentable carbon substrates, and the growth of this transformant was similar to that of the E194KCoq7 mutant after reintroduction of a functional Coq7 copy (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, HPLC analyses confirmed that ubiquinone-6 biosynthesis had been restored in the E194KCoq7 cells harboring the At1g24340 construct (Fig. 5B). Similarly, expression of a matured version of At1g24340—i.e., minus its mitochondrial presequence—complemented an E. coli ΔubiF mutant strain, both when scored for restoration of ubiquinone-8 production and decrease in the accumulation of demethoxyubiquinone-8, the substrate of UbiF (Fig. 5C). In contrast, no complementation was observed when At1g24340 was expressed in the ΔubiIc and ΔubiH mutant strains (Fig. 5, D and E). These data demonstrate that At1g24340 bears demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase activity and that this enzyme displays strict specificity for the C-6 position of the benzoquinone ring. To circumvent the embryo lethal phenotype associated with the complete blockage of ubiquinone biosynthesis in plants and directly investigate the function of At1g24340 in Arabidopsis, antisense constructs constitutively targeting three regions of At1g24340's mRNA were generated (Fig. 6A). Transformants were recovered for all three constructs. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis performed on T1 plants identified five lines (3–10, 3–12, 2–4, 1–3, and 2–1) with pronounced decreases in the level of At1g24340 transcripts, the value of which ranged from 23% to 41% of that of the vector alone controls (Fig. 6B). HPLC analyses of rosette leaf extracts indicated that the ubiquinone-9 content of these transgenics was 40% (RNAi plants 1–3, 2–4, 3–12) to 74% (RNAi pla"
https://openalex.org/W3205954903,"Drug-coated balloon therapy for diseased superficial femoral arteries remains controversial. Despite its clinical relevance, only a few computational studies based on simplistic two-dimensional models have been proposed to investigate this endovascular therapy to date. This work addresses the aforementioned limitation by analyzing the drug transport and kinetics occurring during drug-coated balloon deployment in a three-dimensional geometry.An idealized three-dimensional model of a superficial femoral artery presenting with a calcific plaque and treated with a drug-coated balloon was created to perform transient mass transport simulations. To account for the transport of drug (i.e. paclitaxel) released by the device, a diffusion-reaction equation was implemented by describing the drug bound to specific intracellular receptors through a non-linear, reversible reaction. The following features concerning procedural aspects, pathologies and modelling assumptions were investigated: (i) balloon application time (60-180 seconds); (ii) vessel wall composition (healthy vs. calcified wall); (iii) sequential balloon application; and (iv) drug wash-out by the blood stream vs. coating retention, modeled as exponential decay.The balloon inflation time impacted both the free and specifically-bound drug concentrations in the vessel wall. The vessel wall composition highly affected the drug concentrations. In particular, the specifically-bound drug concentration was four orders of magnitude lower in the calcific compared with healthy vessel wall portions, primarily as a result of reduced drug diffusion. The sequential application of two drug-coated balloons led to modest differences (~15%) in drug concentration immediately after inflation, which became negligible within 10 minutes. The retention of the balloon coating increased the drug concentration in the vessel wall fourfold.The overall findings suggest that paclitaxel kinetics may be affected not only by the geometrical and compositional features of the vessel treated with the drug-coated balloon, but also by balloon design characteristics and procedural aspects that should be carefully considered."
https://openalex.org/W3206304782,"Recently, adaptive filtering algorithms were designed using hyperbolic functions, such as hyperbolic cosine and tangent function. However, most of those algorithms have few parameters that need to be set, and the adaptive estimation accuracy and convergence performance can be improved further. More importantly, the hyperbolic sine function has not been discussed. In this paper, a family of adaptive filtering algorithms is proposed using hyperbolic sine function (HSF) and inverse hyperbolic sine function (IHSF) function. Specifically, development of a robust adaptive filtering algorithm based on HSF, and extend the HSF algorithm to another novel adaptive filtering algorithm based on IHSF; then continue to analyze the computational complexity for HSF and IHSF; finally, validation of the analyses and superiority of the proposed algorithm via simulations. The HSF and IHSF algorithms can attain superior steady-state performance and stronger robustness in impulsive interference than several existing algorithms for different system identification scenarios, under Gaussian noise and impulsive interference, demonstrate the superior performance achieved by HSF and IHSF over existing adaptive filtering algorithms with different hyperbolic functions."
https://openalex.org/W3191307320,"Zinc deficiency has been linked to human diseases, including cancer. MDMX, a crucial zinc-containing negative regulator of p53, has been found to be amplified or overexpressed in various cancers and implicated in the cancer initiation and progression. We report here that zinc depletion by the ion chelator TPEN or Chelex resin results in MDMX protein degradation in a ubiquitination-independent and 20S proteasome-dependent manner. Restoration of zinc led to recovery of cellular levels of MDMX. Further, TPEN treatment inhibits growth of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, which is partially rescued by overexpression of MDMX. Moreover, in a mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analysis, we identified TRPM7, a zinc-permeable ion channel, as a novel MDMX-interacting protein. TRPM7 stabilizes and induces the appearance of faster migrating species of MDMX on SDS-PAGE. Depletion of TRPM7 attenuates, while TRPM7 overexpression facilitates, the recovery of MDMX levels upon adding back zinc to TPEN-treated cells. Importantly, we found that TRPM7 inhibition, like TPEN treatment, decreases breast cancer cell MCF-7 proliferation and migration. The inhibitory effect on cell migration upon TRPM7 inhibition is also partially rescued by overexpression of MDMX. Together, our data indicate that TRPM7 regulates cellular levels of MDMX in part by modulating the intracellular Zn2+ concentration to promote tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3204616838,"Introduction The cost in managing hospitalised dengue patients varies across countries depending on access to healthcare, management guidelines, and state sponsored subsidies. For health budget planning, locally relevant, accurate costing data from prospective studies, is essential. Objective To characterise the direct costs of managing hospitalised patients with suspected dengue infection in Sri Lanka. Methods Colombo Dengue Study is a prospective single centre cohort study in Sri Lanka recruiting suspected hospitalised dengue fever patients in the first three days of fever and following them up until discharge. The diagnosis of dengue is retrospectively confirmed and the cohort therefore has a group of non-dengue fever patients with a phenotypically similar illness, managed as dengue while in hospital. The direct costs of hospital admission (base and investigation costs, excluding medication) were calculated for all recruited patients and compared between dengue and non-dengue categories as well as across subgroups (demographic, clinical or temporal) within each of these categories. We also explored if excluding dengue upfront, would lead to an overall cost saving in several hypothetical scenarios. Results From October 2017 to February 2020, 431 adult dengue patients and 256 non-dengue fever patients were recruited. The hospitalisation costs were USD 18.02 (SD: 4.42) and USD 17.55 (SD: 4.09) per patient per day for dengue and non-dengue patients respectively (p&gt;0.05). Laboratory investigations (haematological, biochemical and imaging) accounted for more than 50% of the total cost. The costs were largely homogenous in all subgroups within or across dengue and non-dengue categories. Excluding dengue upfront by subsidised viral genomic testing may yield overall cost savings for non-dengue patients. Conclusion As non-dengue patients incur a similar cost per day as the dengue patients, confirming dengue diagnosis using subsidised tests for patients presenting in the first three days of fever may be cost-efficient."
https://openalex.org/W3204778487,"Aldolases catalyze the reversible reactions of aldol condensation and cleavage and have strong potential for the synthesis of chiral compounds, widely used in pharmaceuticals. Here, we investigated a new Class II metal aldolase from the p-hydroxyphenylacetate degradation pathway in Acinetobacter baumannii, 4-hydroxy-2-keto-heptane-1,7-dioate aldolase (AbHpaI), which has various properties suitable for biocatalysis, including stereoselectivity/stereospecificity, broad aldehyde utilization, thermostability, and solvent tolerance. Notably, the use of Zn2+ by AbHpaI as a native cofactor is distinct from other enzymes in this class. AbHpaI can also use other metal ion (M2+) cofactors, except Ca2+, for catalysis. We found that Zn2+ yielded the highest enzyme complex thermostability (Tm of 87 °C) and solvent tolerance. All AbHpaI•M2+ complexes demonstrated preferential cleavage of (4R)-2-keto-3-deoxy-D-galactonate ((4R)-KDGal) over (4S)-2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate ((4S)-KDGlu), with AbHpaI•Zn2+ displaying the highest R/S stereoselectivity ratio (sixfold higher than other M2+ cofactors). For the aldol condensation reaction, AbHpaI•M2+ only specifically forms (4R)-KDGal and not (4S)-KDGlu and preferentially catalyzes condensation rather than cleavage by ∼40-fold. Based on 11 X-ray structures of AbHpaI complexed with M2+ and ligands at 1.85 to 2.0 Å resolution, the data clearly indicate that the M2+ cofactors form an octahedral geometry with Glu151 and Asp177, pyruvate, and water molecules. Moreover, Arg72 in the Zn2+-bound form governs the stereoselectivity/stereospecificity of AbHpaI. X-ray structures also show that Ca2+ binds at the trimer interface via interaction with Asp51. Hence, we conclude that AbHpaI•Zn2+ is distinctive from its homologues in substrate stereospecificity, preference for aldol formation over cleavage, and protein robustness, and is attractive for biocatalytic applications."
https://openalex.org/W3205002340,"Current knowledge on responses of aquatic clonal plants to resource availability is largely based on studies manipulating limited resource levels, which may have failed to capture the ""big picture"" for aquatic clonal plants in response to resource availability. In a greenhouse experiment, we grew the floating clonal plant Spirodela polyrhiza under ten nutrient levels (i.e., 1/64×, 1/32×, 1/16×, 1/8×, 1/4×, 1/2×, 1×, 2×, 4× and 8×full-strength Hoagland solution) and examined their responses in terms of clonal growth, morphology and biomass allocations. The responses of total biomass and number of ramets to nutrient availability were unimodal. A similar pattern was found for frond mass, frond length and frond width, even though area per frond and specific frond area fluctuated greatly in response to nutrient availability. In contrast, the responses of root mass and root length to nutrient availability were U-shaped. Moreover, S. polyrhiza invested more to roots under lower nutrient concentrations. These results suggest that nutrient availability may have distinct influences on roots and fronds of the aquatic clonal plant S. polyrhiza, resulting in a great influence on the whole S. polyrhiza population."
https://openalex.org/W3207629321,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multi-faceted gastrointestinal disorder where food intake often triggers symptoms. Metabolomics may provide mechanistical insights to why responses to dietary modifications are diverse.This study aimed to identify metabolite patterns related to dietary intake in patients with IBS, and to identify metabolites driving the separation between responders and non-responders to treatment.Participants were randomized to a low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (LFD) or traditional IBS diet (TID) for four weeks. Fasting serum and urine samples pre- and post-intervention were analyzed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics. Response to treatment was defined as a reduction in IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) ≥50.Twenty-five individuals in the LFD (13 responders) and 28 in the TID (14 responders) were included in these post hoc analyses. In endpoint samples, significant decreases in polyols and glucose were seen in the LFD. Post-intervention samples revealed that LFD responders had significantly increased levels of 2-hydroxybuturate and decreased levels of glucose and pantothenic acid compared to non-responders. For the TID, only weak multivariate models were identified and a larger diversity in metabolite response compared to the LFD were noted.In this study, metabolite patterns between individuals who responded well to an LFD compared to non-responders could be distinguished. This provides new hypotheses for mechanistic actions related to response to dietary modifications, but the results need to be validated in larger cohorts.This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov, registry number NCT02107625."
https://openalex.org/W3203808692,"CCRK/CDK20 was reported to interact with BROMI/TBC1D32 and regulate ciliary Hedgehog signaling. In various organisms, mutations in the orthologs of CCRK and those of the kinase ICK/CILK1, which is phosphorylated by CCRK, are known to result in cilia elongation. Furthermore, we recently showed that ICK regulates retrograde ciliary protein trafficking and/or the turnaround event at the ciliary tips, and that its mutations result in the elimination of intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins that have overaccumulated at the bulged ciliary tips as extracellular vesicles, in addition to cilia elongation. However, how these proteins cooperate to regulate ciliary protein trafficking has remained unclear. We here show that the phenotypes of CCRK -knockout (KO) cells closely resemble those of ICK -KO cells; namely, the overaccumulation of IFT proteins at the bulged ciliary tips, which appear to be eliminated as extracellular vesicles, and the enrichment of GPR161 and Smoothened on the ciliary membrane. The abnormal phenotypes of CCRK -KO cells were rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type CCRK but not its kinase-dead mutant or a mutant defective in BROMI binding. These results together indicate that CCRK regulates the turnaround process at the ciliary tips in concert with BROMI and probably via activating ICK."
https://openalex.org/W3205023199,"The western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is a major corn pest of significant economic importance in the United States. The continuous need to control this corn maize pest and the development of field-evolved resistance toward all existing transgenic maize (Zea mays L.) expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal proteins against WCR has prompted the development of new insect-protected crops expressing distinct structural classes of insecticidal proteins. In this current study, we describe the crystal structure and functional characterization of Mpp75Aa1.1, which represents the first corn rootworm (CRW) active insecticidal protein member of the ETX_MTX2 sub-family of beta-pore forming proteins (β-PFPs), and provides new and effective protection against WCR feeding. The Mpp75Aa1.1 crystal structure was solved at 1.94 Å resolution. The Mpp75Aa1.1 is processed at its carboxyl-terminus by WCR midgut proteases, forms an oligomer, and specifically interacts with putative membrane-associated binding partners on the midgut apical microvilli to cause cellular tissue damage resulting in insect death. Alanine substitution of the surface-exposed amino acids W206, Y212, and G217 within the Mpp75Aa1.1 putative receptor binding domain I demonstrates that at least these three amino acids are required for WCR activity. The distinctive spatial arrangement of these amino acids suggests that they are part of a receptor binding epitope, which may be unique to Mpp75Aa1.1 and not present in other ETX_MTX2 proteins that do not have WCR activity. Overall, this work establishes that Mpp75Aa1.1 shares a mode of action consistent with traditional WCR-active Bt proteins despite significant structural differences."
https://openalex.org/W3206763550,"Lubrication and free radical scavenging are key features of biomaterials used for viscosupplementation (VS) of joints affected by osteoarthritis (OA). The objective of this study was to describe the non-clinical performance characterization of KiOmedine® CM-Chitosan, a non-animal carboxymethyl chitosan, in order to assess its intended action in VS and to compare it to existing viscosupplements based on crosslinked hyaluronan (HA) formulations.The lubrication capacity of the tested viscosupplements (VS) was evaluated in-vitro and ex-vivo. In-vitro, the coefficient of friction (COF) was measured using a novel tribological system. Meanwhile, an ex-vivo biomechanical model in ovine hindlimbs was developed to assess the recovery of join mobility after an intra-articular (IA) injection. Free radical scavenging capacity of HA and KiOmedine® CM-Chitosan formulations was evaluated using the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) assay.In the in-vitro tribological model, KiOmedine® CM-Chitosan showed high lubrication capacity with a significant COF reduction than crosslinked HA formulations. In the ex-vivo model, the lubrication effect of KiOmedine® CM-Chitosan following an IA injection in the injured knee was proven again by a COF reduction. The recovery of joint motion was optimal with an IA injection of 3 ml of KiOmedine® CM-Chitosan, which was significantly better than the crosslinked HA formulation at the same volume. In the in-vitro TEAC assay, KiOmedine® CM-Chitosan showed a significantly higher free radical scavenging capacity than HA formulations.Overall, the results provide a first insight into the mechanism of action in terms of lubrication and free radical scavenging for the use of KiOmedine® CM-Chitosan as a VS treatment of OA. KiOmedine® CM-Chitosan demonstrated a higher capacity to scavenge free radicals, and it showed a higher recovery of mobility after a knee lesion than crosslinked HA formulations. This difference could be explained by the difference in chemical structure between KiOmedine® CM-Chitosan and HA and their formulations."
https://openalex.org/W3202111761,"Amyloid fibrils, crystal-like fibrillar aggregates of proteins associated with various amyloidoses, have the potential to propagate via a prion-like mechanism. Among known methodologies to dissolve preformed amyloid fibrils, acid treatment has been used with the expectation that the acids will degrade amyloid fibrils similar to acid inactivation of protein functions. Contrary to our expectation, treatment with strong acids, such as HCl or H2SO4, of β2-microglobulin (β2m) or insulin actually promoted amyloid fibril formation, proportionally to the concentration of acid used. A similar promotion was observed at pH 2.0 upon the addition of salts, such as NaCl or Na2SO4. Although trichloroacetic acid, another strong acid, promoted amyloid fibril formation of β2m, formic acid, a weak acid, did not, suggesting the dominant role of anions in promoting fibril formation of this protein. Comparison of the effects of acids and salts confirmed the critical role of anions, indicating that strong acids likely induce amyloid fibril formation via an anion-binding mechanism. The results suggest that although the addition of strong acids decreases pH, it is not useful for degrading amyloid fibrils, but rather induces or stabilizes amyloid fibrils via an anion-binding mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3204631988,"Background There is currently no validated risk prediction model for recurrent events among patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Considering that the application of conventional risk scores has contextual limitations, new strategies are needed to develop such a model. Here, we set out to develop and validate a comprehensive risk prediction model for stroke recurrence in AIS patients with AF. Methods AIS patients with AF were collected from multicenter registries in South Korea and Japan. A developmental dataset was constructed with 5648 registered cases from both countries for the period 2011‒2014. An external validation dataset was also created, consisting of Korean AIS subjects with AF registered between 2015 and 2018. Event outcomes were collected during 1 year after the index stroke. A multivariable prediction model was developed using the Fine–Gray subdistribution hazard model with non-stroke mortality as a competing risk. The model incorporated 21 clinical variables and was further validated, calibrated, and revised using the external validation dataset. Results The developmental dataset consisted of 4483 Korean and 1165 Japanese patients (mean age, 74.3 ± 10.2 years; male 53%); 338 patients (6%) had recurrent stroke and 903 (16%) died. The clinical profiles of the external validation set (n = 3668) were comparable to those of the developmental dataset. The c-statistics of the final model was 0.68 (95% confidence interval, 0.66 ‒0.71). The developed prediction model did not show better discriminative ability for predicting stroke recurrence than the conventional risk prediction tools (CHADS 2, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, and ATRIA). Conclusions Neither conventional risk stratification tools nor our newly developed comprehensive prediction model using available clinical factors seemed to be suitable for identifying patients at high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke among AIS patients with AF in this modern direct oral anticoagulant era. Detailed individual information, including imaging, may be warranted to build a more robust and precise risk prediction model for stroke survivors with AF."
https://openalex.org/W3205120837,"In order to propose a more precise definition and explore how to reduce ethical losses in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), we set out to identify trial participants who do not contribute to demonstrating that the treatment in the experimental arm is superior to that in the control arm. RCTs emerged mid-last century as the gold standard for assessing efficacy, becoming the cornerstone of the value of new therapies, yet their ethical grounds are a matter of debate. We introduce the concept of unnecessary participants in RCTs, the sum of non-informative participants and non-responders. The non-informative participants are considered not informative with respect to the efficacy measured in the trial in contrast to responders who carry all the information required to conclude on the treatment’s efficacy. The non-responders present the event whether or not they are treated with the experimental treatment. The unnecessary participants carry the burden of having to participate in a clinical trial without benefiting from it, which might include experiencing side effects. Thus, these unnecessary participants carry the ethical loss that is inherent to the RCT methodology. On the contrary, responders to the experimental treatment bear its entire efficacy in the RCT. Starting from the proportions observed in a real placebo-controlled trial from the literature, we carried out simulations of RCTs progressively increasing the proportion of responders up to 100%. We show that the number of unnecessary participants decreases steadily until the RCT’s ethical loss reaches a minimum. In parallel, the trial sample size decreases (presumably its cost as well), although the trial’s statistical power increases as shown by the increase of the chi-square comparing the event rates between the two arms. Thus, we expect that increasing the proportion of responders in RCTs would contribute to making them more ethically acceptable, with less false negative outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3205510020,"The identification of antibody variable regions in the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains from hybridomas is necessary for the production of recombinant, sequence-defined monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody derivatives. This process has received renewed attention in light of recent reports of hybridomas having unintended specificities due to the production of non-antigen specific heavy and/or light chains for the intended antigen. Here we report a surprising finding and potential pitfall in variable domain sequencing of an anti-human CD63 hybridoma. We amplified multiple VL genes from the hybridoma cDNA, including the well-known aberrant Sp2/0 myeloma VK and a unique, full-length VL. After finding that the unique VL failed to yield a functional antibody, we discovered an additional full-length sequence with surprising similarity (~95% sequence identify) to the non-translated myeloma kappa chain but with a correction of its key frameshift mutation. Expression of the recombinant mAb confirmed that this highly homologous sequence is the antigen-specific light chain. Our results highlight the complexity of PCR-based cloning of antibody genes and strategies useful for identification of correct sequences."
https://openalex.org/W3207702182,"Peri-urban settings have high maternal mortality and the quality of care received in different types of health facilities is varied. Yet few studies have explored the construct of person-centered maternity care (PCMC) within peri-urban settings. Understanding women's experience of maternity care in peri-urban settings will allow health facility managers and policy makers to improve services in these settings. This study examines factors associated with PCMC in a peri-urban setting in Kenya.We analyzed data from a cross-sectional study with 307 women aged 18-49 years who had delivered a baby within the preceding six weeks. Women were recruited from public (n = 118), private (n = 76), and faith based (n = 113) health facilities. We measured PCMC using the 30-item validated PCMC scale which evaluates women's experiences of dignified and respectful care, supportive care, and communication and autonomy. Factors associated with PCMC were evaluated using multilevel models, with women nested within facilities.The average PCMC score was 58.2 (SD = 13.66) out of 90. Controlling for other factors, literate women had, on average, about 6-point higher PCMC scores than women who were not literate (β = 5.758, p = 0.006). Women whose first antenatal care (ANC) visit was in the second (β = -5.030, p = 0.006) and third trimester (β = -7.288, p = 0.003) had lower PCMC scores than those whose first ANC were in the first trimester. Women who were assisted by an unskilled attendant or an auxiliary nurse/midwife at birth had lower PCMC than those assisted by a nurse, midwife or clinical officer (β = -8.962, p = 0.016). Women who were interviewed by phone (β = -7.535, p = 0.006) had lower PCMC scores than those interviewed in person.Factors associated with PCMC include literacy, ANC timing and duration, and delivery provider. There is a need to improve PCMC in these settings as part of broader quality improvement activities to improve maternal and neonatal health."
https://openalex.org/W3202198983,"Adipose tissue is central to the regulation of energy balance. While white adipose tissue (WAT) is responsible for triglyceride storage, brown adipose tissue specializes in energy expenditure. Deterioration of brown adipocyte function contributes to the development of metabolic complications like obesity and diabetes. These disorders are also leading symptoms of the Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS), a hereditary disorder in humans which is caused by dysfunctions of the primary cilium and which therefore belongs to the group of ciliopathies. The cilium is a hair-like organelle involved in cellular signal transduction. The BBSome, a supercomplex of several Bbs gene products, localizes to the basal body of cilia and is thought to be involved in protein sorting to and from the ciliary membrane. The effects of a functional BBSome on energy metabolism and lipid mobilization in brown and white adipocytes were tested in whole-body Bbs4 knockout mice that were subjected to metabolic challenges. Chronic cold exposure reveals cold-intolerance of knockout mice but also ameliorates the markers of metabolic pathology detected in knockouts prior to cold. Hepatic triglyceride content is markedly reduced in knockout mice while circulating lipids are elevated, altogether suggesting that defective lipid metabolism in adipose tissue creates increased demand for systemic lipid mobilization to meet energetic demands of reduced body temperatures. These findings taken together suggest that Bbs4 is essential for the regulation of adipose tissue lipid metabolism, representing a potential target to treat metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3204531100,"Purpose Intravitreal anti-VEGF injection (IVI) is administered before vitrectomy to assist management of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)-related complications. In the clinical setting, retinal surgeons determine the use of preoperative IVI based on individual criteria. In this study, we investigated factors related to the potential bias of retinal surgeons in using IVI prior to vitrectomy for PDR-related complications, and evaluated the real-world outcomes of surgeon-determined preoperative IVI. Methods Medical records of 409 eyes of 409 patients who underwent 25-gauge vitrectomy for PDR complications at seven Japanese centers (22 surgeons) were retrospectively reviewed. Ocular factors, demographic and general clinical factors, surgical procedures, and postoperative complications were compared between IVI group (patients who received preoperative IVI; 87 eyes, 21.3%) and non-IVI group (patients who did not receive preoperative IVI; 322 eyes, 78.7%). In addition, baseline HbA1c in IVI group and non-IVI group was compared between eyes with and without postoperative complications. Results At baseline, IVI group was younger (P&lt;0.001), had shorter duration of diabetes treatment (P = 0.045), and higher frequencies of neovascular glaucoma [NVG] (P&lt;0.001) and tractional retinal detachment [TRD] (P&lt;0.001) compared to non-IVI group. Although IVI group had higher frequencies of intraoperative retinal break and tamponade procedure, there were no significant differences in postoperative complications and additional treatments between two groups. Baseline HbA1c levels were also not correlated with postoperative complications of VH, NVG, and RD both in IVI group and non-IVI group. Logistic regression analysis identified age (P&lt;0.001, odds ratio [OR] 0.95), presence of NVG (P&lt;0.001, OR 20.2), and presence of TRD (P = 0.0014, OR 2.44) as preoperative factors in favor of IVI. Conclusions In this multicenter real-world clinical study, younger age and presence of NVG and TRD were identified as potential biases in using IVI before vitrectomy for PDR complications. Eyes that received preoperative IVI had more intraoperative retinal breaks requiring tamponade than eyes not receiving IVI, but postoperative outcome was not different between the two groups."

Molecular markers can be used as proxies evaluating the connectivity and inferring population structure and larval dispersal. This study characterizes population structure as well as horizontal and vertical genetic connectivity of the broadcasting coral Pocillopora verrucosa from Ludao, a small oceanic island off the eastern coast of Taiwan. We genotyped 75 P. verrucosa specimens from three sites (Gongguan, Dabaisha, and Guiwan) at three depth ranges (Shallow: 7-15 m, Mid-depth: 23-30 m, and Deep: 38-45 m), spanning shallow to upper mesophotic coral reefs, with eight microsatellite markers. F-statistics showed a moderate differentiation (FST = 0.106, p<0.05) between two adjacent locations (Dabaisha 23-30 and Dabaisha 38-45 m), but no differentiation elsewhere, suggesting high levels of connectivity among sites and depths. STRUCTURE analysis showed no genetic clustering among sites or depths, indicating that all Pocillopora individuals could be drawn from a single panmictic population. Simulations of recent migration assigned 30 individuals (40%) to a different location from where they were collected. Among them, 1/3 were assigned to deeper locations, 1/3 to shallower populations and 1/3 were assigned to the right depth but a different site. These results suggest high levels of vertical and horizontal connectivity, which could enhance the recovery of P. verrucosa following disturbances around Ludao, a feature that agrees with demographic studies portraying this species as an opportunistic scleractinian."
https://openalex.org/W3136499032,"This paper proposes a task-driven computational framework for assessing diffusion MRI experimental designs which, rather than relying on parameter-estimation metrics, directly measures quantitative task performance. Traditional computational experimental design (CED) methods may be ill-suited to experimental tasks, such as clinical classification, where outcome does not depend on parameter-estimation accuracy or precision alone. Current assessment metrics evaluate experiments' ability to faithfully recover microstructural parameters rather than their task performance. The method we propose addresses this shortcoming. For a given MRI experimental design, experiments are simulated start-to-finish and task performance is computed from ROC curves and associated summary metrics (e.g. AUC). Two experiments were performed: first, a validation of the pipeline's task performance predictions against clinical results, comparing in-silico predictions to real-world ROC/AUC; and second, a demonstration of the pipeline's advantages over traditional CED approaches, using two simulated clinical classification tasks. Comparison with clinical datasets validates our method's predictions of (a) the qualitative form of ROC curves, (b) the relative task performance of different experimental designs, and (c) the absolute performance of each experimental design. Furthermore, we show that our method outperforms traditional task-agnostic assessment methods, enabling improved, more useful experimental design. Compared to current approaches, such task-driven assessment is more likely to identify experimental designs that perform well in practice. Our method is not limited to diffusion MRI; the pipeline generalises to any task-based quantitative MRI application, and provides the foundation for developing future task-driven end-to end CED frameworks."
https://openalex.org/W3203515620,"Introduction Breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to ensure infant health and survival. Inadequate breastfeeding practices, and knowledge among adolescent mothers have led to unprecedented infant and child morbidity and mortality. Given, the high global prevalence of adolescent mothers it is imperative to understand how the knowledge of breastfeeding practices operates among adolescent girls across different socio-economic settings. Materials &amp; methods Data was carried out from Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults (UDAYA) survey, conducted in 2015–16. Descriptive statistics along with bivariate analysis was done to examine the preliminary results. For analysing the association between the binary outcome variable and other explanatory variables, binary logistic regression method was used. The explanatory variables were educational status of the respondent, media exposure, working status, ever pregnant status (only for married adolescent girls), sex and age of the household head, educational status of the head of the household, caste, religion, wealth index, residence and states. Results About 42%, 50%, and 42% of married adolescent girls had knowledge of immediate breastfeeding, yellowish milk, and exclusive breastfeeding respectively. The odds of knowledge about immediate breastfeeding [married-AOR: 1.57; CI: 1.09–2.28 and unmarried-AOR: 1.30; CI: 1.08–1.55], yellowish milk feeding [married-AOR: 2.09; CI: 1.46–3.01 and unmarried-AOR: 1.39; CI: 1.17–1.66], and exclusive breastfeeding [married-AOR: 1.74; CI: 1.2–2.52 and unmarried-AOR: 1.46; CI: 1.22–1.76] were significantly more among adolescent girls aged 19 years old compared to 15 years old girls. Adolescent married and unmarried girls with 10 &amp; above years of schooling were 1.82 times [AOR: 1.82; CI: 1.52–2.18] and 2.69 times [AOR: 2.69; CI: 2.08–3.47] more likely to have knowledge about immediate breastfeeding, 1.74 times [AOR: 1.74; CI: 1.45–2.09] and 2.10 times [AOR: 2.10; CI: 1.68–2.62] more likely to have knowledge about yellowish milk feeding, and 3.13 times [AOR: 3.13; CI: 2.6–3.78] and 3.87 times [AOR: 3.87; CI: 2.95–5.08] more likely to have knowledge about exclusive breastfeeding respectively than girls with no schooling. Conclusion Breastfeeding practices and interpersonal counselling from elders in the household should be encouraged. Ongoing breastfeeding promotion programs of the government should promote high education of adolescent girls. Mass media interventions should be encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W3204268057,"Using whole genome sequencing, PCI Domain Containing 2 (PCID2) was identified to be amplified in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we investigated the expression, biological function, molecular mechanism, and clinical implication of PCID2 in CRC. PCID2 mRNA and protein expression were higher in CRC cells and tumor tissues compared to healthy colonic tissues. The copy number of PCID2 was positively correlated with its mRNA expression. Multivariate analysis revealed that PCID2 is an independent prognostic factor for CRC recurrence. Functional studies showed that PCID2 promoted cell growth, cell cycle progression, and cell migration/invasion, while apoptosis was suppressed. Moreover, PCID2 promoted xenograft growth and lung metastasis in nude mice. Using co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy, we showed that PCID2 binds to promyelocytic leukemia (PML), a tumor suppressor involved in non-canonical β-catenin signaling. PCID2 promoted the degradation of PML via poly-ubiquitination, which in turn, induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling while simultaneously repressing ARF-p53 pathway. Thus, these results demonstrated that PCID2 functions as an oncogene in CRC by enhancing canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and inhibition of CTNNB1-ARF-p53 axis. PCID2 promoted canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC via degradation of PML. PCID2 may serve as an independent prediction marker for CRC recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W3204783510,"Mitochondria are essential organelles that carry out a number of pivotal metabolic processes and maintain cellular homeostasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by various stresses is associated with many diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, cancer, heart failure, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging. Therefore, it is important to understand the stimuli that induce mitochondrial stress. However, broad analysis of mitochondrial stress has not been carried out to date. Here, we present a set of fluorescent tools, called mito-Pain (mitochondrial PINK1 accumulation index), which enable the labeling of stressed mitochondria. Mito-Pain uses PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) stabilization on mitochondria and quantifies mitochondrial stress levels by comparison with PINK1-GFP, which is stabilized under mitochondrial stress, and RFP-Omp25, which is constitutively localized on mitochondria. To identify compounds that induce mitochondrial stress, we screened a library of 3374 compounds using mito-Pain and identified 57 compounds as mitochondrial stress inducers. Furthermore, we classified each compound into several categories based on mitochondrial response: depolarization, mitochondrial morphology, or Parkin recruitment. Parkin recruitment to mitochondria was often associated with mitochondrial depolarization and aggregation, suggesting that Parkin is recruited to heavily damaged mitochondria. In addition, many of the compounds led to various mitochondrial morphological changes, including fragmentation, aggregation, elongation, and swelling, with or without Parkin recruitment or mitochondrial depolarization. We also found that several compounds induced an ectopic response of Parkin, leading to the formation of cytosolic puncta dependent on PINK1. Thus, mito-Pain enables the detection of stressed mitochondria under a wide variety of conditions and provides insights into mitochondrial quality control systems. Mitochondria are essential organelles that carry out a number of pivotal metabolic processes and maintain cellular homeostasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by various stresses is associated with many diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, cancer, heart failure, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging. Therefore, it is important to understand the stimuli that induce mitochondrial stress. However, broad analysis of mitochondrial stress has not been carried out to date. Here, we present a set of fluorescent tools, called mito-Pain (mitochondrial PINK1 accumulation index), which enable the labeling of stressed mitochondria. Mito-Pain uses PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) stabilization on mitochondria and quantifies mitochondrial stress levels by comparison with PINK1-GFP, which is stabilized under mitochondrial stress, and RFP-Omp25, which is constitutively localized on mitochondria. To identify compounds that induce mitochondrial stress, we screened a library of 3374 compounds using mito-Pain and identified 57 compounds as mitochondrial stress inducers. Furthermore, we classified each compound into several categories based on mitochondrial response: depolarization, mitochondrial morphology, or Parkin recruitment. Parkin recruitment to mitochondria was often associated with mitochondrial depolarization and aggregation, suggesting that Parkin is recruited to heavily damaged mitochondria. In addition, many of the compounds led to various mitochondrial morphological changes, including fragmentation, aggregation, elongation, and swelling, with or without Parkin recruitment or mitochondrial depolarization. We also found that several compounds induced an ectopic response of Parkin, leading to the formation of cytosolic puncta dependent on PINK1. Thus, mito-Pain enables the detection of stressed mitochondria under a wide variety of conditions and provides insights into mitochondrial quality control systems. Mitochondria are complex organelles that play a variety of roles in various metabolic processes, including energy production, lipid synthesis, and protein translation, and as dynamic organelles, they frequently exhibit changes in shape, size, and distribution in response to various stimuli. These proper functions of mitochondria are essential for cell survival (1Saraste M. Oxidative phosphorylation at the fin de siècle.Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). ATP production through the respiration chain is a key activity in eukaryotes, but respiration in mitochondria generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) (2Li X. Fang P. Mai J. Choi E.T. Wang H.

Davies K.J. Lon protease preferentially degrades oxidized mitochondrial aconitase by an ATP-stimulated mechanism.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Misfolding of mitochondrial proteins and defects in protein transport through mitochondrial translocons injure mitochondria as well (7Nargund A.M. Pellegrino M.W. Fiorese C.J. Baker B.M. Haynes C.M. Mitochondrial import efficiency of ATFS-1 regulates mitochondrial UPR activation.Science. 2012; 337: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 8Weidberg H. Amon A. MitoCPR-A surveillance pathway that protects mitochondria in response to protein import stress.Science. 2018; 360eaan4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The effects of damaged mitochondria (e.g., generating ROS) exacerbate DNA mutagenesis and lead to several deleterious outcomes, such as aging and neoplastic transformation. To prevent these negative effects, quality control systems remove mitochondrial damaged proteins through the action of mitochondrial proteases, which degrade mitochondrial proteins, or by mitophagy, which degrades damaged mitochondria by autophagy (8Weidberg H. Amon A. MitoCPR-A surveillance pathway that protects mitochondria in response to protein import stress.Science. 2018; 360eaan4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Pickles S. Vigié P.

The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix is sensed by PINK1 to induce PARK2/Parkin-mediated mitophagy of polarized mitochondria.Autophagy. 2013; 9: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, defects in mitochondrial quality control systems increase the number of damaged mitochondria, which results in several diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (11Palikaras K. Daskalaki I. Markaki M. Tavernarakis N. Mitophagy and age-related pathologies: Development of new therapeutics by targeting mitochondrial turnover.Pharmacol. Ther. 2017; 178: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial depolarization is associated with mitochondrial stress. Because several fluorescent dyes, including tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester and MitoTracker, specifically stain polarized mitochondria in cells, measurement of the fluorescence intensity using these reagents enables the detection of mitochondrial depolarization (12Scaduto R.C. Grotyohann L.W. Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential using fluorescent rhodamine derivatives.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 13Poot M. Zhang Y.Z. Krämer J.A. Wells K.S. Jones L.J. Hanzel D.K. Lugade A.G. Singer V.L. Haugland R.P. Analysis of mitochondrial morphology and function with novel fixable fluorescent stains.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). JC-1, a ratiometric dye that stains polarized mitochondria red and depolarized mitochondria green, is a sensitive indicator of mitochondrial depolarization. However, most of them are not suitable for use with fixation (14Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Rabinowich H. Interrelated roles for Mcl-1 and BIM in regulation of TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10153-10163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Another problem is that, all the reagents measure only mitochondrial stress accompanied with mitochondrial depolarization. To understand mitochondrial stress, it is important to quantitatively detect a broad range of mitochondrial stress types in addition to depolarization. Mitochondria are complex organelles in which most mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nuclear DNA, and highly dynamic machines drive and contribute to mitochondrial translocases to import mitochondrial proteins (15Rehling P. Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Truscott K.N. The mitochondrial import machinery for preproteins.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, disturbances of mitochondrial homeostasis by mitochondrial stress cause a reduction in the protein import activity. Hence, we hypothesized that measurement of mitochondrial import activity can be an indicator of mitochondrial stress. PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) is a mitochondrial protein identified as a responsible gene in Parkinson’s disease (16Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Mutations in the parkin gene cause autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism.Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4087) Google Scholar, 17Valente E.M.

Salvi S. et al.Hereditary early-onset Parkinson's disease caused by mutations in PINK1.Science. 2004; 304: 1158-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar). PINK1 is a Ser/Thr kinase that undergoes autophosphorylation and phosphorylates Parkin and ubiquitin. PINK1–Parkin–mediated mitophagy has been well characterized, and Parkin activated by PINK1 ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial proteins that are targeted for mitophagy, leading to the degradation of damaged mitochondria (18Koyano F. Okatsu K. Kosako H. Tamura Y. Go E. Kimura M. Kimura Y. Tsuchiya H. Yoshihara H. Hirokawa T. Endo T. Fon E.A. Trempe J.F. Saeki Y.

PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of the Parkin ubiquitin-like domain primes mitochondrial translocation of Parkin and regulates mitophagy.Sci. Rep. 2012; 2: 1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). PINK1 is the critical factor in mitophagy because PINK1 functions at the initial mitophagy step to distinguish healthy and stressed mitochondria. For healthy mitochondria, translated PINK1 is transported into mitochondria through the Tom complex on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the Tim23 complex on the inner mitochondrial membrane by a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). After passing through the Tim–Tom complex, a mitochondrial protease cleaves the N-terminal MTS of PINK1. Then, PARL, an inner mitochondrial membrane–resident protease, further cleaves PINK1 within the transmembrane domain (TMD). This truncated PINK1 is retrotranslocated into the cytosol and degraded by the proteasome (21Jin S.M. Lazarou M. Wang C. Kane L.A. Narendra D.P. Youle R.J. Mitochondrial membrane potential regulates PINK1 import and proteolytic destabilization by PARL.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 22Yamano K. Youle R.J.

The mitochondrial intramembrane protease PARL cleaves human Pink1 to regulate Pink1 trafficking.J. Neurochem. 2011; 117: 856-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In stressed mitochondria (e.g., depolarized mitochondria), the inactivated TIM23 complex does not allow PINK1 passage; therefore, PINK1 is not cleaved by PARL. Noncleaved PINK1 accumulates on the OMM, where it is stabilized by autophosphorylation and multimerization, thereby recruiting and then phosphorylating Parkin, which subsequently ubiquitinates the mitochondrion for mitophagy (23Meissner C. Lorenz H. Weihofen A. Selkoe D.J. Lemberg M.K. The mitochondrial intramembrane protease PARL cleaves human Pink1 to regulate Pink1 trafficking.J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 36372-36384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PINK1 is a mitochondrial quality control factor in addition to inducing Parkin-mediated mitophagy upon mitochondrial depolarization. Besides import inhibition caused by depolarization, misfolding proteins in the mitochondrial matrix or disturbance of mitochondrial calcium density also leads to PINK1 recruitment to mitochondria (10Jin S.M. Youle R.J. The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix is sensed by PINK1 to induce PARK2/Parkin-mediated mitophagy of polarized mitochondria.Autophagy. 2013; 9: 1750-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 26Huang E. Qu D. Huang T. Rizzi N. Boonying W. Krolak D. Ciana P. Woulfe J. Klein C. Slack R.S. Figeys D. Park D.S. PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of LETM1 regulates mitochondrial calcium transport and protects neurons against mitochondrial stress.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). So, mitochondrial PINK1 can be used as an indicator of mitochondrial stresses. In addition, considering that the expression of Parkin is restricted to some tissues, such as nerves and the liver, ubiquitous expression of PINK1 may explain that PINK1 has a Parkin-independent role in mitochondrial quality control (27Kühn K. Zhu X.R. Lübbert H. Stichel C.C. Parkin expression in the developing mouse.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2004; 149: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Unoki M. Nakamura Y. Growth-suppressive effects of BPOZ and EGR2, two genes involved in the PTEN signaling pathway.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Indeed, HeLa cells express endogenous PINK1, which is recruited to depolarized mitochondria without the expression of Parkin (21Jin S.M. Lazarou M. Wang C. Kane L.A. Narendra D.P. Youle R.J. Mitochondrial membrane potential regulates PINK1 import and proteolytic destabilization by PARL.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), suggesting that PINK1 might have roles in the mitochondrial quality control system independent of Parkin. Therefore, a broad exploration of the PINK1-mediated mitochondrial quality control system will contribute to the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial quality control. To address the challenge posed by measuring mitochondrial stress, we generated a novel ratiometric fluorescent sensor using PINK1 that quantitively measures various mitochondrial stresses. We screened 3374 compounds using the new screening strategy and identified various types of mitochondrial stress inducers, including depolarization-independent and Parkin-independent mitochondrial stress. This novel tool is cost-effective and fixable, and it can be used to measure various mitochondrial stresses in culture cells quantitatively. To quantify mitochondrial stress, we generated a plasmid-based ratiometric fluorescent sensor constructed with PINK1-GFP, which is stabilized on mitochondria in a stress-dependent manner. PINK1-GFP was linked with the T2A “self-cleaving” peptide sequence (29Kim J.H. Lee S.R. Li L.H. Park H.J. Park J.H. Lee K.Y. Kim M.K. Shin B.A. Choi S.Y.

Ryan M.D. Analysis of the aphthovirus 2A/2B polyprotein 'cleavage' mechanism indicates not a proteolytic reaction, but a novel translational effect: A putative ribosomal 'skip'.J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) and fused with RFP and the TMD of Omp25 (31Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Recruitment of an alternatively spliced form of synaptojanin 2 to mitochondria by the interaction with the PDZ domain of a mitochondrial outer membrane protein.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2991-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which is a tail-anchored protein that is inserted into the OMM in a stress-independent manner to compensate for its expression level. The resultant plasmid (full-length PINK1-GFP-T2A-RFP-Omp25TMD) is referred to as the mitochondrial PINK1 accumulation index (containing full-length PINK1) (mito-Pain F) (Fig. 1A). During translation, PINK1-GFP-T2A-RFP-Omp25TMD is cleaved at the T2A sequence, and the former region generates PINK1-GFP, which is transported to mitochondria by the MTS in the N terminus of PINK1. The latter region constitutes RFP-Omp25. In healthy mitochondria, PINK1-GFP is imported into mitochondria and then rapidly undergoes cleavage by a mitochondrial inner-membrane protease and is then retrotranslocated into the cytosol. Cytosolic cleaved PINK1-GFP is immediately degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, stressed mitochondria (e.g., depolarization) do not allow the translocation of PINK1-GFP through the inner membrane complex. Therefore, PINK1-GFP is localized and stabilized on the OMM (Fig. 1B). However, RFP-Omp25, the internal control of expression level, is always localized on the OMM, which enables quantification by calculating the GFP-RFP signal ratio of mito-Pain F under mitochondrial stress. To assess whether mito-Pain F is capable of indicating mitochondrial stress, we generated HeLa cells stably expressing mito-Pain F using a lentivirus system. In the cells expressing PINK1-GFP alone, GFP colocalized with the outer mitochondrial protein TOM20 upon mitochondrial depolarization induced by treatment with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), as expected (Fig. 1C). Cells expressing mito-Pain F also showed colocalization of GFP and RFP-OMP25 with Tom20. An immunoblot analysis showed that mito-Pain F expressed PINK1-GFP and RFP-Omp25 separately, and T2A cleavage was efficient, with a rate higher than 99.3%, and exogenous PINK1 was expressed several-fold more than endogenous PINK1 (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that the addition of the T2A peptide did not affect the localization and the stability of PINK1-GFP. PINK1-GFP was very low under basal conditions (Fig. 1, D and E). In contrast, induction of mitochondrial depolarization markedly increased GFP fluorescence intensity, and the GFP-RFP ratio under stressed conditions was 2.2-fold higher as that under basal conditions. We also confirmed that CCCP-induced PINK1-GFP in cells expressing mito-Pain F colocalized with RFP-Omp25 (Fig. 1E, right panel). These results suggest that mito-Pain F indicates mitochondrial stress. Because PINK1 overexpression relieves mitochondrial stress and might be not convenient to use for stress detection (32Wen Y. Gu Y. Tang X. Hu Z. PINK1 overexpression protects against cerebral ischemia through Parkin regulation.Environ. Toxicol. 2020; 35: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 33Sánchez-Mora R.M. Arboleda H. Arboleda G. PINK1 overexpression protects against C2-ceramide-induced CAD cell death through the PI3K/AKT pathway.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2012; 47: 582-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we generated mito-Pain F with PINK1 kinase-dead (KD) cells. However, PINK1KD-GFP (19Okatsu K. Oka T. Iguchi M. Imamura K. Kosako H. Tani N. Kimura M. Go E. Koyano F. Funayama M. Shiba-Fukushima K. Sato S. Shimizu H. Fukunaga Y. Taniguchi H. et al.PINK1 autophosphorylation upon membrane potential dissipation is essential for Parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) showed very weak stability even after cell treatment with CCCP (data not shown). This finding is consistent with the previous finding that PINK1 is stabilized by self-oligomer formation via autophosphorylation (25Okatsu K. Uno M. Koyano F. Go E. Kimura M. Oka T. Tanaka K. Matsuda N. A dimeric PINK1-containing complex on depolarized mitochondria stimulates Parkin recruitment.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 36372-36384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we replaced the kinase domain with the self-oligomer domain PB1 from PKCζ in mito-Pain (34Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. PB1 domain-mediated heterodimerization in NADPH oxidase and signaling complexes of atypical protein kinase C with Par6 and p62.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 35Sumimoto H. Kamakura S. Ito T. Structure and function of the PB1 domain, a protein interaction module conserved in animals, fungi, amoebas, and plants.Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007re6Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although PINK1ΔKD-PB1 showed improved GFP stability in cells treated CCCP, this mito-Pain variant was more resistant to retrotranslocation into the cytosol under basal conditions (data not shown). To facilitate degradation under basal conditions, we added the degron domain from Rpn4, which promotes proteasomal degradation (36Erales J. Coffino P. Ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 37Morozov A.V. Spasskaya D.S. Karpov D.S. Karpov V.L. The central domain of yeast transcription factor Rpn4 facilitates degradation of reporter protein in human cells.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 3713-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid (PINK1ΔKD-PB1-GFP-degron-T2A-RFP-Omp25TMD) is referred to as truncated mito-Pain (mito-Pain T) (Fig. 2A). The GFP-RFP ratio of mito-Pain T was 3.4-fold higher in CCCP-treated cells than in nontreated cells (Fig. 2, B and C), and the GFP signal of mito-Pain T upon CCCP treatment colocalized with RFP-Omp25 (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that mito-Pain T was more sensitive to mitochondrial stress than mito-Pain F. Notably, cells with high expression of mito-Pain T induced aggregation of GFP-positive mitochondria under mitochondrial stress conditions, possibly because of excessive multimerization capacity conferred through PB1 domains on mitochondria (Fig. 2D). To avoid mitochondrial aggregation, we cloned monoclonal HeLa cells stably expressing mito-Pain T at low levels, and these cells did not show aggregated mitochondria. Stabilized GFP and efficient cleavage at the T2A site in the cells stably expressing mito-Pain T were verified by immunoblotting (Fig. S1A). The GFP signal of mito-Pain T did not colocalize with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes and partially colocalized with peroxisomes, which is in a similar manner to other overexpressed membrane proteins mislocalized to incorrect organelles (Fig. 2E) (38Setoguchi K. Otera H. Mihara K. Cytosolic factor- and TOM-independent import of C-tail-anchored mitochondrial outer membrane proteins.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5635-5647Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To investigate the sensitivity of mito-Pain, we next quantified mitochondrial stress by known cell stress–inducing compounds using mito-Pain T. As expected, treatment with CCCP, oligomycin and antimycin (mitochondrial respiration inhibitors), and valinomycin (an ionophore) markedly elevated the GFP-RFP ratio to be more than 3.8-fold the level induced by dimethyl sulfoxide treatment (Fig. 2F). Treatment with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, led to the greatest increase in the GFP-RFP ratio, which is 38.5-fold (Fig. 2F). MG-132 has been shown to induce caspase-mediated apoptosis with mitochondrial depolarization (39Guo N. Peng Z. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, induces apoptosis in tumor cells.Asia Pac. J. Clin. Oncol. 2013; 9: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, considering proteasomal degradation of retrotranslocated PINK1 in the cytosol, the increase in the ratio induced by MG-132 was mainly due to a secondary effect. Fluorescence microscopy can be used to distinguish the accumulation of PINK1-GFP upon inhibition of proteasomal degradation or stabilization on mitochondria. Indeed, GFP accumulation both on mitochondria and in the cytosol after cell treatment with MG-132 was observed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2G). Although PINK1 stability under thapsigargin treatment exhibited a marginal difference of ∼1.53 (Fig. 2F), fluorescence microscopic observation elucidated that PINK1-GFP localized to mitochondria (Fig. S1B). Taken together, the combination of flow cytometry and microscopy is a more reliable approach for analyzing mitochondrial stress using mito-Pain. To identify novel mitochondrial stress inducers, we screened a Validated Compound Library (Drug Discovery Initiative) containing 3374 known compounds with mito-Pain T using flow cytometry and microscopy (Fig. 3). For the first screening, monoclonal HeLa cells expressing mito-Pain T were treated with each compound (10 μM) for 24 h, and then, the GFP-RFP ratio was measured by flow cytometry. From the first screening, 352 compounds showed elevated >1.2 PINK1 stability. For the second screening, we treated cells with each of the 352 compounds, and using fluorescence microscopy, we evaluated whether GFP localized to mitochondria or other compartments. Finally, we obtained 57 hit compounds considered to be mitochondrial stress inducers (Table S1). To further characterize each phenotype, we selected one-half of the compounds on the basis of their functional properties. For example, among the hit compounds, compounds with higher PINK1 stability and a common function were selected, and in contrast, compounds that are difficult to purchase were not chosen. We purchased the selected 25 compounds separately from the compound library and confirmed reproducibility using mito-Pain T. The results showed that cell treatment with each of the selected compounds increased PINK1-GFP stability and induced PINK1-GFP localization on mitochondria, suggesting that these 25 compounds induce mitochondrial stress (Table 1). This new screening strategy is referred to as a mito-Pain assay.Table 1Summary of mitochondrial stress by identified compoundsRankingCompoundFunctionMitochondrial morphologyDep.ParkinReference1MG-11520S and 26S proteasome inhibitorAggregationCytosol(51Nam Y.J.

https://openalex.org/W3206468298,"Background Back pain patients are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety and reduced quality of life. Pain drawing is a simple, frequently used anamnesis tool that facilitates communication between physicians and patients. This study analysed pain drawings to examine whether pain drawing is suitable as a screening tool for signs of anxiety, depression or reduced quality of life, as the detection of these symptoms is essential for successful treatment. Methods Pain drawings of 219 patients with lower back pain were evaluated retrospectively. Pain drawings are a schematic drawing of a human being. Six variables of the pain drawing were analysed. Subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the Short Form 12 (SF-12) were used to measure anxiety, depression and quality of life, respectively. Descriptive statistics, uni- and multivariate linear regression analyses and analysis of variance were performed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted for suitable variables. Results We revealed significant positive correlations between the variables ""filled body surface"" and ""number of pain sites"" and the anxiety (HADS-A) and depression subscales (HADS-D) of the HADS (p&lt;0.01). The same predictors had significant negative correlations with the MCS (p&lt;0.01). However, the sensitivity and specificity of the variable ""number of pain sites"" were too low compared to those for existing screening tests to consider it as a screening tool for anxiety, depression and quality of life (HADS-A: sensitivity: 45.2%, specificity: 83.3%; HADS-D: sensitivity: 61.1%, specificity: 51%; MCS: sensitivity: 21.2%, specificity: 85.7%). Conclusions There were significant correlations between the amount of filled body surface and the number of pain sites in the pain drawing and anxiety, depression and quality of life. Although useful in routine clinical practice, pain drawing cannot be used as a screening tool based on our results."
https://openalex.org/W3206905180,"Rates of chronic pain and daily opioid use are higher among veterans relative to civilian populations. Increasing physical activity can reduce pain severity and decrease opioid use among patients with chronic pain. Behavioral economic strategies can improve physical activity levels but have been undertested in veterans with chronic pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate if a financial incentive combined with a loss aversion component-a ""regret lottery"" in which veterans could win money if they met a set goal or told how much they could have won had they met their goal-would increase physical activity levels among veterans with chronic pain. A 12-week single-blinded randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04013529) was designed. Veterans with chronic pain (N = 40) receiving care at a specialty pain clinic were eligible for participation, and were randomly assigned (1:1) to either (a) activity trackers and daily text message reminders to increase physical activity (""control arm""), or (b) the same plus a weekly regret lottery (""intervention arm""). For those in the intervention arm, participants who met their activity goal, had a chance to win a small ($30) or large ($100) gift card incentive; those who did not meet their goals were informed of what they would have won had they met their goal. The primary outcome, physical activity, was measured using self-reported physical activity and step counts using activity trackers. Secondary outcomes included changes in physical function, chronic pain severity, depression and opioid use. The sample was primarily white, male and disabled, with an average age of 57 years. No between-arm differences were noted for physical activity, physical function, chronic pain severity, depression or opioid use. Regret lottery-based approaches may be ineffective at increasing physical activity levels in veterans with chronic pain. Trial Registry: NCT04013529."
https://openalex.org/W3202363560,"The genetic underpinnings of most pediatric-cancer cases are unknown. Population-based studies use large sample sizes but have accounted for only a small proportion of the estimated heritability of pediatric cancers. Pedigree-based studies are infeasible for most human populations. One alternative is to collect genetic data from a single nuclear family and use inheritance patterns within the family to filter candidate variants. This approach can be applied to common and rare variants, including those that are private to a given family or to an affected individual. We evaluated this approach using genetic data from three nuclear families with 5, 4, and 7 children, respectively. Only one child in each nuclear family had been diagnosed with cancer, and neither parent had been affected. Diagnoses for the affected children were benign low-grade astrocytoma, Wilms tumor (stage 2), and Burkitt’s lymphoma, respectively. We used whole-genome sequencing to profile normal cells from each family member and a linked-read technology for genomic phasing. For initial variant filtering, we used global minor allele frequencies, deleteriousness scores, and functional-impact annotations. Next, we used genetic variation in the unaffected siblings as a guide to filter the remaining variants. As a way to evaluate our ability to detect variant(s) that may be relevant to disease status, the corresponding author blinded the primary author to affected status; the primary author then assigned a risk score to each child. Based on this evidence, the primary author predicted which child had been affected in each family. The primary author’s prediction was correct for the child who had been diagnosed with a Wilms tumor; the child with Burkitt’s lymphoma had the second-highest risk score among the seven children in that family. This study demonstrates a methodology for filtering and evaluating candidate genomic variants and genes within nuclear families that may merit further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3202393100,"The protein Lgl1 is a key regulator of cell polarity. We previously showed that Lgl1 is inactivated by hyperphosphorylation in glioblastoma as a consequence of PTEN tumour suppressor loss and aberrant activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway; this contributes to glioblastoma pathogenesis both by promoting invasion and repressing glioblastoma cell differentiation. Lgl1 is phosphorylated by atypical protein kinase C that has been activated by binding to a complex of the scaffolding protein Par6 and active, GTP-bound Rac. The specific Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors that generate active Rac to promote Lgl1 hyperphosphorylation in glioblastoma are unknown. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout PREX1, a PI 3-kinase pathway-responsive Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor, in patient-derived glioblastoma cells. Knockout cells had reduced Lgl1 phosphorylation, which was reversed by re-expressing PREX1. They also had reduced motility and an altered phenotype suggestive of partial neuronal differentiation; consistent with this, RNA-seq analyses identified sets of PREX1-regulated genes associated with cell motility and neuronal differentiation. PREX1 knockout in glioblastoma cells from a second patient did not affect Lgl1 phosphorylation. This was due to overexpression of a short isoform of the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor TIAM1; knockdown of TIAM1 in these PREX1 knockout cells reduced Lgl1 phosphorylation. These data show that PREX1 links aberrant PI 3-kinase signaling to Lgl1 phosphorylation in glioblastoma, but that TIAM1 is also to fill this role in a subset of patients. This redundancy between PREX1 and TIAM1 is only partial, as motility was impaired in PREX1 knockout cells from both patients."
https://openalex.org/W3202760050,"Dr. Paul S. Frenette, M.D. passed away on July 26th, 2021 at the age of 56. He was an extraordinarily clever, compassionate, and collegial physician scientist. He was a stalwart champion for medical research and for ensuring translation of his discoveries to the clinic for the benefit of patients with intractable medical conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia, prostate cancer, and sickle cell disease. He was revered for his creative, rigorous paradigm-shifting science and loved for his kindness, humbleness, and humor. Paul will be dearly missed by his family and friends. He adored his wife Nadine and their children Clara and Albéric. He was so proud of their accomplishments and was looking forward to watching their journeys into college and life. He glowed when he would talk about his family. We extend the deepest and heartfelt condolences to them as well as his siblings, his current and former trainees, colleagues, and friends as we all mourn this monumental loss. Although a New Yorker for over two decades, Paul was originally from Québec City, Canada and was raised in a loving family with two brothers and two sisters. Here he acquired his love of skiing and hockey. He began his medical journey at Université Laval with subsequent training at McGill University and the New England Medical Center. In Boston, Paul truly found his love and aptitude for science as well as the love of his life, his wife Nadine. In 1998, Paul was recruited by Barry Coller to Mount Sinai School of Medicine to start his own lab and eventually joined the Einstein faculty in 2010 as a professor of medicine and cell biology and the inaugural director and chair of the Ruth L. and David S. Gottesman Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. His research achievements, leadership, and mentoring commitment over the years have been truly exceptional and are widely recognized both nationally and internationally (Figure 1). His lab’s early work on selectins led to transformative treatments for vaso-occlusion in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) (Turhan et al., 2002Turhan A. Weiss L.A. Mohandas N. Coller B.S. Frenette P.S. Primary role for adherent leukocytes in sickle cell vascular occlusion: a new paradigm.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 3047-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Paul built on this finding not only from a basic science perspective, but with an eye on how to help improve the lives of patients who suffer so much. He worked closely with physicians and drug companies to foster this finding into meaningful action, which culminated in the 2019 approval of an anti-P-selectin antibody for the treatment of SCD vaso-occlusion. Due to his attention to detail, Paul’s group made another unexpected seminal discovery that the nervous system regulated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) behavior (Katayama et al., 2006Katayama Y. Battista M. Kao W.M. Hidalgo A. Peired A.J. Thomas S.A. Frenette P.S. Signals from the sympathetic nervous system regulate hematopoietic stem cell egress from bone marrow.Cell. 2006; 124: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar; Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008Méndez-Ferrer S. Lucas D. Battista M. Frenette P.S. Haematopoietic stem cell release is regulated by circadian oscillations.Nature. 2008; 452: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). This work thrust him to the forefront of the HSC niche field where he quickly became a rising star and leader. Paul had a way of elevating those around him. His focus and work ethic are embodied in a phrase he shared often with his longtime administrator Joan Pitcan, “Get it done.” Paul was not about excuses, but solutions. He would challenge his trainees to find solutions to difficult but critical scientific questions. Similarly, science, hard work, and respect were at the forefront as he developed the Stem Cell Institute at Einstein. His out-of-the box approach to science will live on in his trainees, who know that they are better scientists for having worked with him. He challenged his trainees to think deeper. He was often right, but he would “bet them a beer” to prove him wrong. Let us all raise a glass to the eminent Dr. Paul Frenette. Paul was an outstanding hematology fellow in my laboratory in the nineties and after that a long-term collaborator and friend. He had little lab experience when he joined my group, but this was compensated for by great courage and intelligence. He wished to learn the new knockout mouse technology and decided to begin by preparing a double knockout of P-and E-selectin genes located very close to each other. This meant modifying a preexisting embryonic stem cell lacking P-selectin a second time, which had not been done before. My objections that such overmanipulated cells may not get incorporated into the germline, and that a mouse without both endothelial selectins may not live, were promptly dismissed. The three-year project, in collaboration with Tanya Mayadas and Richard Hynes (MIT), produced a very interesting mouse whose hematological phenotype was described by Paul in Cell (Frenette et al., 1996Frenette P.S. Mayadas T.N. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. Susceptibility to infection and altered hematopoiesis in mice deficient in both P- and E-selectins.Cell. 1996; 84: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This work established that selectins mediate leukocyte rolling in vivo. Paul also deduced that platelets and leukocytes have more in common than anyone had anticipated. Paul continued to produce exciting, unexpected observations throughout his career. It breaks my heart that it ended early; mentees are not supposed to leave before their mentors. Paul’s work resulted in a paradigm shift in the understanding of SCD and energized a field that had been searching in vain for novel therapies for over 50 years. He was the first to identify the critical role of neutrophils and heterocellular adhesive interactions in SCD pathophysiology. While there were initially many detractors of this model, the translation of these observations in the clinic has already profoundly changed patients’ lives. I knew Paul as a collaborator, a dear friend, and a role model. Paul was a tremendous scientist, but above all he was an exceptional person with the highest integrity. He cared deeply about the accuracy and quality of his scientific work, and this was his North Star. This, I think, informed his remarkable focus and intensity in moving projects forward and navigating any difficult professional interactions with clarity, ease, and grace. He was generous with his time and guidance, trusted people easily, smiled readily, and was always authentic. He was deeply affected by the suffering of the patients with SCD and once said to me that it was “enough” and he needed to find a way to make SCD better. The field has lost a tremendous champion. I will miss him deeply. Paul has been an invaluable member and frequent speaker on the conference circuit of the cancer, hematology, and stem cell fields. His innovative and pioneering research and critical contributions to discussions at conferences have greatly influenced the development of these fields in numerous directions. A proud French Canadian, Paul’s sharp mind, dry humor, and charm were much appreciated during conference dinners, receptions, and scientific discussions among colleagues. He was also fond of the arts and enjoyed visiting exhibitions surrounding the conferences. Paul was an enthusiastic skier who could always be found on the slopes during breaks at Keystone conferences and was always up for a little fun racing. As a connoisseur of red wine and especially champagne—preferably Dom Pérignon—he was not averse to sometimes making scientific bets on a good bottle. Paul will be sorely missed in the conference world and beyond, not only as a mentor and stimulus for new scientific developments, but also as a colleague and friend with his gracious, jovial, and inspiring personality. I mourn the loss of one of my best friends. When I first met Paul, it was in New York City at a conference. Instead of taking me to a stylish restaurant, he brought a box of sandwiches and took me to Central Park, where we sat on a stone and enjoyed lunch. We talked frankly and casually without any formalities. In science, he was serious and careful. At the same time, he was also a man who knew how to enjoy and appreciate a life. He was good humored and interested in different cultures and traditions. Besides science meetings, I had numerous and precious opportunities to share time with Paul. Once, we went to the Tsukiji Fish Market at 5 a.m. to see the tuna auction. Paul was so impressed, and after the auction we ate sushi with the fishmongers. On another occasion, we went to sumo wrestling. Paul was so excited and asked me so many questions; many of them I could not answer even though I know quite a bit about sumo. I miss his radiant smile, which delighted me. Not only have we lost a great scientist, but I have lost a good friend. Please rest in peace. The day I learned Paul had slipped away from us was the saddest, and probably the toughest, day I have ever spent at Einstein. I vividly remember that after I signed the offer letter from Einstein 10 years ago, Paul took my wife and I to his favorite restaurant, JoJo, where he spoke passionately about the Institute’s future and how together we would expand the scope of stem cell research at Einstein. I have countless beautiful memories of Paul. I clearly remember one particular miracle: for a west coast conference, we scheduled completely different flights at different airports with departures hours apart. We said, “See you later in LA!” as we set off separately from Einstein. But due to my flight experiencing delays, we found ourselves exiting back-to-back taxis at the same moment as we arrived at the conference. We laughed then that this only confirmed “it was destiny for us to become colleagues at Einstein!” I so enjoyed the time we spent organizing symposia, retreats, and other activities. After hours, we shared so many memorable dinners, with Paul always picking the perfect wine. My office was situated directly across from Paul’s, and I chatted with him whenever we crossed paths as if he were my nearest brother, and Paul just as often stopped by my office to enjoy a cup of coffee with me. We pondered, discussed, and argued over a wide range of topics, from key attitudes as a PI to the latest ice hockey news. There is no question that Paul is a pioneering scientist and his contributions to the field have been exceptional. But it was his wonderful personality that won me over as a friend. I want to emphasize how fortunate I was to have Paul as my role model and faculty mentor. He always offered sound advice, kept me on the right track, and helped me initiate and sustain a successful independent career. Paul will deeply be missed. Paul was always there, like a friend, for his trainees, staff and fellow faculty. As a faculty member, I often went to him with questions and problems on grants, lab affairs, paper submissions, and more. I could talk to him so openly, like he was an older brother. He had nurtured this environment in the institute which was not just for performing high-caliber science but also for building those strong bonds and friendships. That is why losing him so suddenly has been so tough. It was a privilege and luxury to have a scientist so brilliant, kind, and caring on my side. He was instrumental in getting my independent academic career started and helping me grow as a scientist. He was sharp and practical, but more importantly a good-hearted and simply good human being. I will deeply miss his sense of humor and our many banters over food. While we lost him too soon, his legacy in the institute and in the field is cemented forever. Because Paul always dressed so formal and proper many people did not realize that he had a mischievous streak. When I joined the lab at Mount Sinai in 2007, I became the third Spanish postdoc in the lab (together with Andres Hidalgo and Simón Méndez-Ferrer). Paul spoke zero Spanish, but he had learned from Andres to pronounce the word “caramba”—which loosely translates as “Oh, this is surprising”—perfectly. For some reason he was inordinately proud of this and anytime that he talked with one of us he would start with an “Ah, caramba...” and continued using “caramba” through the conversation. For example, I might walk into his office and ask “Paul, can I show you some cool results?” He would reply, “Ah, caramba…Of course!” Then I’d go ahead and show him the data and—if the data were interesting and surprising enough—he would start saying “Caramba! Caramba!” excitedly. He’d then glance surreptitiously at me and start asking “Caramba? Caramba?” to see if I was confident with the results and would finish with a “Very good! Caramba!” I’d leave his office excited to know that my research was going in the right direction and proud of how cool my boss was. I am going to really miss running into him at a meeting and hearing “Ah! Caramba.” Paul was my mentor for more than nine years. During that time, he trained me as a scientist and became a cherished friend. His easy manner was disarming and even made interviewing for a coveted postdoc position in his lab a fond memory. I met Paul in Glasgow where he was giving a seminar on circadian regulation of the stem cell niche. Rather than meeting in a conference room, Paul suggested we go to a local pub to discuss science and watch the soccer World Cup. He could seamlessly ask astute questions, make suggestions on my PhD project, and make pointed comments on the game. The day after this meeting, Paul offered me a position in his lab that I quickly accepted, which has made all the difference in my life. Paul helped me and my lab colleagues (the “Frenettocytes”) grow tremendously as scientists (Figure 2). As I develop my own team now, I often ask myself, “What would Paul do?” Beyond science, Paul truly loved life with a massive passion for his family, friends, classical music, great wine, and good food. He had a wonderful boisterous laugh that would fill the room. I will miss him dearly."
https://openalex.org/W3204418615,"Introduction Determinants of parathyroid hormone level during pregnancy have been less frequently studied. We aimed to describe the serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its determinants in Sri Lankan pregnant women in a community setting. Materials and methods In this cross-sectional analysis, 390 pregnant mothers in their third trimester were enrolled from primary care centers of 15 health divisions in the Colombo District in Sri Lanka. Venous blood was analyzed for a total 25-hydroxyvitamin-D [25(OH)D], serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium, and alkaline phosphatase. The bone quality was assessed in terms of speed of sound (SOS) using the quantitative ultrasound scan (QUS). Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to examine the determinants of PTH concentration in blood. Results Median serum 25(OH)D was 17.5ng/mL. Most (61.6%) were vitamin D deficient (&lt;20ng/mL). Median PTH was 23.7pg/mL. Only 0.8% had hyperparathyroidism (PTH &gt;65pg/mL). The correlation between 25(OH)D and PTH was weak but significant (r = -0.197; p&lt;0.001). SOS Z-score was below the cut-off (≤−2) in fifty-six women (14.7%), and SOS did not relate significantly to PTH. In regression analysis, serum 25(OH)D, serum calcium, body mass index, educational level, and weeks of pregnancy were significant independent variables when adjusted. The model explained 16% of the variation in the PTH level. Conclusions A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was observed among Sri Lankan pregnant women in the present study. Serum 25(OH)D, calcium, weeks of pregnancy, and educational level were determinants of serum PTH."
https://openalex.org/W3207286616,"The present study investigated an integrated life course model, drawn from the life course theoretical perspective, to elucidate youth's additive, cascading, and cumulative life course processes stemming from early socioeconomic adversity and education polygenic score (education PGS) as well as potential interactions between them (GxE), which contribute to subsequent young adult socioeconomic outcomes. Additionally, the independent, varying associations among social and genetic predictors, life-stage specific educational outcomes (educational achievement in adolescence and educational attainment, in later stages), and young adult economic outcomes were examined. The study used prospective, longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent and Adult Health (Add Health) with a sample of 5,728 youth of European ancestry. Early family socioeconomic adversity and individual education PGS were associated with life stage-specific educational outcomes through additive and cascading processes linked to young adults' economic outcomes (personal earnings) through a cumulative process. A GxE moderation existed between individuals' education PGS and early socioeconomic adversity at multiple life stages, explaining variation in adolescent educational outcomes. Both early socioeconomic adversity and education PGS were persistently associated with youth's educational and economic outcomes throughout the early life course. In sum, the findings based on the integrated life course model showed how additive, cascading, and cumulative processes were related and conditioned one another, generating specific life course patterns and outcomes. The findings highlight the value of incorporating molecular genetic information into longitudinal developmental life course research and provide insight into malleable characteristics and appropriate timing for interventions addressing youth developmental characteristics."
