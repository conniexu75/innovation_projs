Mice sera exhibit similar sexual variations in activity, but to a lesser degree. (2) Immature female rats and probably senile female rats possess a low serum cholinesterase activity, in the same range as that of the mature male rats."

https://openalex.org/W2074853396,"Reproduction studies with mice and rats kept on whole plant rations have been in progress in this labora.tory for several years. In the first experiments, poor reproduction performance was observed (1), but later much more satisfactory results were obtained ,..-:ith.a slightly modified diet (2). The only difference ~in the composition of the diets was that the salt mixture supplement used originally did not contain 'cobalt, whereas in the later experiments 0.2% CoC12 was added to the salt complemento Because of the apparent infiuence of this small amount of dietary Co on reproduction, the present study was undertaken. The rats used were of the Sprague-Dawley strain, raised in our laboratory; the mice were of the same albino strain used in the previous experiments. The rats had been kept on a whole plant ration for at least 3 generations prior to the start of the present expebiments, and the mice for at least 5 generations. ThE!animals were kept on the basal ration in common cages until females became pregnant. These were put in <;inglescreen-bottomed cages and given the respective experimental diets and water ad lib. Litters were requced by random selection to 6 and weaned at the age of 28 days. The composition of the basal diet was: solventextracted soybean meal, 46; cornmeal, 46; sesame oil containing 0.2% percol11orphum oil and 0.2% wheat germ oil, 5; salt mixture II USP, 2; thial11ine,0.3 mg; ribofiavin, 0.3 mg; calcium pantothenate, 2 mg; pyridoxin, 0.2 mg; choline hydrocloride, 100 mg; nicotinic acid, 2 mg; folic acid, 0.025 lllg; biotin, 0.01 mg; inositol, 10 mg; P ABA, .25 mg. The diet has been analyzed by microbiological l11ethods and found to contain about 0.5 i.tgjlOO g of vitamin B12 activity (2). Cobalt was supplied in the diet by adding 0.2% CoCl2 to. the salt mixture, or in the drinking water in a concentration of 0.2 l11g% of CoCI2; when cobalt was injected, a 0.1% solution of CoCl2 in physiological saline solution was used, of which 0.2 mI was injected in each female 2-6 days prior to giving birth. A total of 130 litters of mice and 64 litters of rats was used in the present study. The effect of cobalt on the reproduction of l11ice was studied in 4 series (Table 1). In the control group receiving the soybean-corn ration without added CoCI2, the nUl11berof young weanedjlitter born was 3.4. With the addition of 4 l11g% CoCl2 to the diet, the ratio of young weanedjlitter born was 4.7. When the drinking water contained 0.2 mg% CoC12, the survival of the young was practically equal to the group receiving the Co supplement in the diet. Intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of 0.2 mg of CoC12 into the 1110therbefore giving birth did not significantly improve the survival of the young in comparison with the control group. Performance of the group receiving vitamin B12 in the diet was markedly better than that observed with the Cosupplemented diets. The results obtained with rats (Table 2) were similar to those observed with l11ice.Only 1.4 young survived the 4-weeks weaning age out of each litter born on the diet without added Co, whereas on the Cosupplemented diet 1.75 survived, on the average. When Co was added to the drinking water, the corresponding value was 2.9. The mean weights of the young at the age of 28 days were 35, 54, and 55 g, respectively. The group receiving the CoCl2 in the drinking water did as well as a group receiving the corn-soybean diet supplemented with 40 i.tgjkg of vitamin B12• The supplementation also caused a significant weight gain of the mothers during the suckling periodo .The difference between the numbers of litters dead in the control series and in those receiving a -supplemented diet was never significant. This may be due to the fact that the feeding of the supplement was started only a few days before the birth of the litters. The results of these experiments indicate that cobalt is of definite benefit for the reproduction of both mice and rats when they are kept on a whole plant ration low in vitamin B12• The al110unt of Co present in the diet was not deterl11ined. The daily amount of Co de-"

The importance of science in shaping the daily course of events has been made known to all, partly through the literature of technology, but chiefly by the instrumentalities themselves and their omnipresence in our daily lives."
