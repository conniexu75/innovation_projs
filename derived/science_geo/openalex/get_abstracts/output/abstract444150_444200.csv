https://openalex.org/W2088954489,"Dynamin mediates various membrane fission events, including the scission of clathrin-coated vesicles. Here, we provide direct evidence for cooperative membrane recruitment of dynamin with the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins, endophilin and amphiphysin. Surprisingly, endophilin and amphiphysin recruitment to membranes was also dependent on binding to dynamin due to auto-inhibition of BAR-membrane interactions. Consistent with reciprocal recruitment in vitro, dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane in cells was strongly reduced by concomitant depletion of endophilin and amphiphysin, and conversely, depletion of dynamin dramatically reduced the recruitment of endophilin. In addition, amphiphysin depletion was observed to severely inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, GTP-dependent membrane scission by dynamin was dramatically elevated by BAR domain proteins. Thus, BAR domain proteins and dynamin act in synergy in membrane recruitment and GTP-dependent vesicle scission.

Thus, BAR domain proteins and dynamin act in synergy in membrane recruitment and GTP-dependent vesicle scission. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME)4 is a major cellular pathway for synaptic vesicle recycling, receptor internalization, and the uptake of extracellular nutrients (1McMahon H.T. Boucrot E. Molecular mechanism and physiological functions of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). It relies on the concerted action of numerous proteins, many of which bind to membranes and sense or induce bilayer morphology changes. BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain-containing proteins have been proposed to recruit dynamin to the neck regions of forming clathrin-coated pits via their SRC homology 3 (SH3) domains that bind to the C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) of dynamin (2Gout I.

They are also implicated in membrane sculpting of the neck regions and thereby forming a template for dynamin oligomerization (5Roux A. Koster G. Lenz M. Sorre B. Manneville J.B. Nassoy P.

A mutant of dynamin lacking the PRD remains cytosolic in cells (3Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. A binding site for SH3 domains targets dynamin to coated pits.J. Biol.

Amphiphysin and endophilin are two prominent contenders. Both have a similar domain organization containing an N-BAR domain and an SH3 domain (7Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J.

In addition, amphiphysin also binds to AP2 and clathrin (11McMahon H.T. Wigge P. Smith C.

Overexpression of the amphiphysin SH3 domain inhibits transferrin endocytosis, a defect that can be rescued by overexpression of dynamin but not by an SH3-binding-deficient mutant of dynamin (12Wigge P.

In addition, it has been shown that endophilin forms a pre-scission complex with dynamin in lamprey synapses (20Sundborger A. Soderblom C. Vorontsova O. Evergren E. Hinshaw J.E. Shupliakov O.

Another protein proposed to be involved in CME is sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) (23Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R.

It has a BAR and an SH3 domain that binds to dynamin. The involvement of BAR domain proteins in dynamin activity is implied from the direct interaction with dynamin (21Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K.

However, the role of these BAR domain proteins in dynamin recruitment has remained an inference, which we now investigate.

Approximately 2 × 105 or 2.5 × 104 cells were cultured on 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek) or 13-mm coverslips, respectively. Cells were transfected twice (on day 1 and 2) with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) with a total of 80 pmol of each indicated siRNA and analyzed on day 4 (72 h after the first transfection). The siRNAs used were as follows: Amph1+2 pool 1, HSS100465 (two oligos against human amphiphysin1, Invitrogen) and 4392420 s1341 (one oligo against human amphiphysin2 (BIN1), Ambion); Amph1+2 pool 2, HSS100466 (two oligos against human amphiphysin1, Invitrogen) and 4392420 s1342 (one oligo against human amphiphysin2 (BIN1), Ambion); Amph1+2 pool 3, HSS100467 (two oligos against human amphiphysin1, Invitrogen) and 4392420 s1343 (one oligo against human amphiphysin2 (BIN1), Ambion); EndoA1+2+3 pool 1, L-012597 (four oligos against human endophilinA1, Dharmacon), L-019582 (four oligos against human endophilinA2, Dharmacon), and L-015728 (four oligos against human endophilinA3, Invitrogen); EndoA1+2+3 pool 2, HSS109708 (two oligos against human endophilinA1, Invitrogen), HSS109705 (two oligos against human endophilinA2, Invitrogen), and HSS109711 (two oligos against human endophilinA3, Invitrogen); EndoA1+2+3 pool 3, HSS109709 (two oligos against human endophilinA1, Invitrogen), HSS109706 (two oligos against human endophilinA2, Invitrogen), and HSS109712 (2 oligos against human endophilinA3, Invitrogen); SNX9 siRNA-1, HSS122185 (two oligos against human SNX9, Invitrogen); SNX9 siRNA-2, HSS122186 (two oligos against human SNX9, Invitrogen), SNX9 siRNA-3, HSS122187 (two oligos against human SNX9, Invitrogen); SNX9 pool, HSS122185, HSS122186, and HSS122187 (a total of six oligos against human SNX9, Invitrogen); DNM1+2 pool 1, HSS176208 (two oligos against human dynamin1, Invitrogen) and J-004007-06 (one oligo against human dynamin2, Thermo Scientific); DNM1+2 pool 2, HSS102821 (two oligos against human dynamin1, Invitrogen) and J-004007-08 (one oligo against human dynamin2, Thermo Scientific). Control samples were transfected in the same way as the RNAi samples but a scrambled control siRNA oligo (Invitrogen) was used instead. In some experiments, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) using 0.05 to 0.2 μg or 1 μg (overexpression experiments) of amphiphysin1-eGFP, amphiphysin1-TagRFP-T, amphiphysin2-eGFP, amphiphysin2-TagRFP-T, TagRFP-T-SNX9, endophilinA2-eGFP, or endophilinA2-TagRFP-T (all human). Cells were incubated for 24 h to express the constructs before imaging. Cells were imaged live directly or fixed (3.7% paraformaldehyde, 20 min at room temperature) and stained using goat anti-endophilin (S-15) (sc10880, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-endophilin (H-60) (sc-25495, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and donkey anti-goat Alexa-546 or goat anti-rabbit Alexa-546 (Molecular Probes) and mounted on slides using 1,4-diazobicyclo-[2,2,2]-octane. Just before live-cell imaging, the medium was changed to minimum Eagle's medium without phenol red, supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5% FBS, and placed into a temperature-controlled chamber on the microscope stage with 95% air, 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. Live-cell imaging was performed as in Ref. 29Henne W.M. Boucrot E. Meinecke M. Evergren E. Vallis Y. Mittal R. McMahon H.T. FCHo proteins are nucleators of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Science. 2010; 328: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar. Briefly, live-cell and fixed-cell imaging data were acquired using a fully motorized inverted microscope (Eclipse TE-2000, Nikon) equipped with a CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal head (Ultraview Vox, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a ×60 lens (Plan Apochromat VC, 1.4 NA, Nikon) under control of Volocity 5.0 (Improvision, UK). 14-Bit digital images were obtained with a cooled EMCCD camera (9100–02, Hamamatsu, Japan). Two 50 milliwatt solid-state lasers (488 and 561; Crystal Laser and Melles Griots) coupled to an individual acoustic-optical tunable filter were used as the light source to excite eGFP and TagRFP-T or Alexa-546 as appropriate. Dynaminen levels at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, B and E) were measured by summing the fluorescence signals on at least 10,000 μm2 of cell membrane from snapshots at various times along live-cell imaging time lapses. Lifetimes of dynaminen were measured on kymographs. Please note that endogenous dynamin is detected for a longer time than transiently expressed versions (28Doyon J.B. Zeitler B. Cheng J. Cheng A.T. Cherone J.M. Santiago Y. Lee A.H. Vo T.D. Doyon Y. Miller J.C. Paschon D.E. Zhang L. Rebar E.J. Gregory P.D. Urnov F.D. Drubin D.G. Rapid and efficient clathrin-mediated endocytosis revealed in genome-edited mammalian cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Relative levels of BAR domain proteins at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, F and H) correspond to the sum of the fluorescence intensities of at least 100 punctae, normalized to the control levels. Approximately 1 × 106 RPE1 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transfected twice (on day 1 and 2) with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) with a total of 600 pmol of the indicated siRNA and analyzed on day 4 (72 h after the first transfection). AlexaFluor-488-labeled human transferrin (Molecular Probes, used at 20 μg/ml) uptake was carried at 37 °C for 7 min. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, detached by a 1-min incubation with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA, spun, acid-washed (ice-cold buffer, pH 5, to remove surface-bound ligand), washed, fixed (paraformaldehyde 3.7% for 20 min), washed, and resuspended in PBS and analyzed using LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry provided similar phenotypes than those obtained by classical microscopy-based measurement of ligand uptake but allowed an increase in at least 2 log in the number of cells analyzed. 1-μl drops of lipid mixtures (50 mol % Folch Avanti Polar Lipids (Avanti), 40 mol % Folch Sigma (Sigma), 5 mol % 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (Avanti), and 4 mol % phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Avanti), 1 mo % rhodamine-PE (Avanti)) were applied to indium/tin oxide-covered glass slides. A GUV generation chamber was assembled by separating two slides by a 400 mm glucose solution and thin rubber spacer. We adjusted a previously described electro-formation protocol (30Angelova M.I. Dimitrov D.S. Faraday Discuss. 1986; 81: 303Crossref Google Scholar) so that an electrical field (AC) was applied for 195 min at 55 °C (45 min, 0.1–1.4 V at 10 Hz; 120 min, 1.4 V at 10 Hz; 30 min, 2.1 V at 4.5 Hz). GUVs were freshly prepared for each experiments and used immediately. Experiments were carried out using the spinning-disc confocal microscope described above. Reactions took place in a 250-μl chamber (Lab-Tek, Borosilicate). To avoid disruption of the GUVs on contact, the chamber was coated with BSA. 50 μl of GUV solution (400 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was added to 150 μl of buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Osmolalities of the GUV solution and the buffer were matched to the osmolalities of the protein solutions. Proteins were added using a 50-μl Hamilton syringe with a bent tip. Protein concentrations are indicated in the figure legends, but these are likely overestimates, as the protein tends to coat the walls of the incubation chamber, as seen from the increasing fluorescent signal. To avoid disruption of the GUVs, the solution was mixed by gentle rotation of a pipette tip. If GTP was used, 100 μm MgCl2 was mixed into the buffer before GUVs were added. All experiments were carried out at 37 °C. Full-length rat amphiphysin 2–6 and full-length rat endophilin A1 were cloned into pGEX-6P2. Proteins were expressed in BL21 cells for 1 h at 37 °C for amphiphysin and 16 h at 18 °C for the remaining proteins. Cells were lysed using Emulsiflex C3 and spun at 40,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti45 rotor, and the supernatant was bound to glutathione beads for 30 min. The beads were washed extensively with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, with two washes at 500 mm NaCl in between. The GST tag was cleaved using PreScission protease. Cleaved proteins were further purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration. Full-length rat dynamin 1 was cloned into pET15b. The SH3 domain of rat amphiphysin 2 (13Owen D.J. Wigge P. Vallis Y. Moore J.D. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Crystal structure of the amphiphysin-2 SH3 domain and its role in the prevention of dynamin ring formation.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5273-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was cloned into pGEX-4T2. Proteins were expressed in BL21 cells for 16 h at 18 °C. Cell pellets were mixed in a ratio of 1 liter of amphiphysin SH3 to 6 liters of dynamin. Cells were lysed using Emulsiflex C3 and spun at 125,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti45 rotor, and the supernatant was bound to glutathione beads for 30 min. The beads were washed extensively with 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA. Proteins were eluted with free glutathione and bound to Q-Sepharose at 150 mm NaCl and eluted with a salt gradient to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing dynamin alone were pooled and concentrated. Protein was further purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration. Dynamin 1 ΔPRD was cloned into pET15b with a PrSc cleavage site after Thr-752. Overexpression and purification were done according to full-length dynamin protocol until the beads were washed. Protein was then eluted by adding PrSc protease to the beads and further purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration. Proteins were labeled with Alexa dyes using commercially available labeling kits (Alexa-488 and Alexa-647 protein labeling kits from Invitrogen). Liposomes had the same composition as GUVs excluding rhodamine-PE. Lipids were mixed and dried under a stream of argon. To get rid of the remaining solvents, lipids were desiccated for 2 h. Buffer was added to give a final concentration of 1 mg/ml liposomes. Liposomes were re-hydrated for 1 h followed by five freeze-thaw cycles. Liposomes were extruded 21 times through a 100-nm filter (Nucleopore, Track-Etch, Whatman) and used immediately. Liposomes were incubated with 1 μm of the protein(s) indicated in the figures. After 20 min at 37 °C, the liposomes were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants and pellets were separated, and equal amounts of each were loaded onto an SDS gel. The role of BAR domain proteins thought to recruit dynamin to clathrin-coated pits was assessed in a genome-edited skin fibroblast cell line (SK-MEL-2) having all endogenous clathrin and dynamin2 molecules tagged with red fluorescent protein and eGFP, respectively (28Doyon J.B. Zeitler B. Cheng J. Cheng A.T. Cherone J.M. Santiago Y. Lee A.H. Vo T.D. Doyon Y. Miller J.C. Paschon D.E. Zhang L. Rebar E.J. Gregory P.D. Urnov F.D. Drubin D.G. Rapid and efficient clathrin-mediated endocytosis revealed in genome-edited mammalian cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Depletion of amphiphysin (Amph1+2) by RNA interference (RNAi) led to an increased and prolonged dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, A–C). The increased dynamin recruitment is consistent with the known action of amphiphysin in preventing dynamin assembly into larger structures in vitro (13Owen D.J. Wigge P. Vallis Y. Moore J.D. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Crystal structure of the amphiphysin-2 SH3 domain and its role in the prevention of dynamin ring formation.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5273-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The result also implies that other proteins in addition to amphiphysin are involved in dynamin recruitment. Consistently, amphiphysin RNAi led to defective CME as measured by transferrin (Tf) uptake (Fig. 1, D and E). This strong dependence of CME on amphiphysin is in line with Saccharomyces cerevisiae amphiphysin homologues, with Rvs164/167 being important for endocytosis and observed on the necks of endocytic structures (31Lombardi R. Riezman H. Rvs161p and Rvs167p, the two yeast amphiphysin homologs, function together in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6016-6022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Kaksonen M. Toret C.P. Drubin D.G. A modular design for the clathrin- and actin-mediated endocytosis machinery.Cell. 2005; 123: 305-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The severity is less consistent with the weak endocytic phenotype of knock-out (KO) mice for amphiphysin1, where amphiphysin2 expression levels are seen to be concomitantly decreased and where synaptic vesicle recycling defects are only observed with strong stimulations (33Di Paolo G. Sankaranarayanan S. Wenk M.R. Daniell L. Perucco E. Caldarone B.J. Flavell R. Picciotto M.R. Ryan T.A. Cremona O. De Camilli P.

However, residual amphiphysin2 in these mice is likely to be functional. Endophilin is also proposed to be involved in dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane. Depletion of endophilin (EndoA1+2+3) induced a small decrease in dynamin recruitment, a slight increase in dynamin lifetime at clathrin-coated pits, but no significant decrease in Tf uptake (Fig. 1, B–E, and supplemental Fig. S1A). Consistent with the observation that SNX9 is recruited after dynamin, endophilin, and amphiphysin (27Taylor M.J. Perrais D. Merrifield C.J. A high precision survey of the molecular dynamics of mammalian clathrin-mediated endocytosis.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1000604Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), RNAi of SNX9 did not result in detectable changes in dynamin levels at the plasma membrane nor in Tf uptake decrease (Fig. 1, A–E, and supplemental Fig. S1A), and thus it is unlikely to mediate dynamin recruitment at clathrin-coated pits. The concomitant knockdown of both endophilin and amphiphysin, however (EndoA1+2+3 + Amph1+2 RNAi, supplemental Fig. S2), induced a significant diminution of dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, A and B) as well as a marked reduction in Tf uptake (Fig. 1, D and E). Although overexpression of individual full-length BAR+SH3 domain proteins promoted dynamin recruitment to membranes in cells (Fig. 1, F and G, and supplemental Fig. S1B), a significant reduction of dynamin recruitment required the depletion of multiple proteins, implying redundancy between them (Fig. 1B). Given the altered dynamin recruitment with BAR protein depletion, we asked if the plasma membrane localization of BAR+SH3 domain-containing proteins could be altered by decreased dynamin levels. When testing BAR domain protein recruitment to the plasma membrane upon dynamin depletion (DNM1+2 RNAi), we saw that amphiphysin and SNX9 recruitment was unchanged (Fig. 1H and supplemental Fig. S1B), consistent with their additional binding to AP2 and clathrin through their middle domains (11McMahon H.T.

Pitstop2 had no effect on endophilin recruitment (Fig. 1J and supplemental Fig. S1D). Neither RNAi of amphiphysin nor addition of pitstop2 prevents dynamin recruitment to sites of CME (Fig. 1, B and J), yet in both cases the lack of amphiphysin at clathrin-coated pits does not allow for functional vesicle scission, implying that amphiphysin plays a key role in the precise localization of dynamin and/or its function. Finally, dynamin depletion led to a clear reduction of endophilin recruitment to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, F and G, and supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). This indicates a degree of cooperativity of dynamin and endophilin binding to the membrane, as endophilin displays no direct clathrin interaction as a"

https://openalex.org/W2047635605,"High doses of dexamethasone (Dex) or myostatin (Mstn) induce severe atrophy of skeletal muscle. Here we show a novel microRNA1 (miR1)-mediated mechanism through which Dex promotes skeletal muscle atrophy. Using both C2C12 myotubes and mouse models of Dex-induced atrophy we show that Dex induces miR1 expression through glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We further show that Mstn treatment facilitates GR nuclear translocation and thereby induces miR1 expression. Inhibition of miR1 in C2C12 myotubes attenuated the Dex-induced increase in atrophy-related proteins confirming a role for miR1 in atrophy. Analysis of miR1 targets revealed that HSP70 is regulated by miR1 during atrophy. Our results demonstrate that increased miR1 during atrophy reduced HSP70 levels, which resulted in decreased phosphorylation of AKT, as HSP70 binds to and protects phosphorylation of AKT. We further show that loss of pAKT leads to decreased phosphorylation, and thus, enhanced activation of FOXO3, up-regulation of MuRF1 and Atrogin-1, and progression of skeletal muscle atrophy. Based on these results, we propose a model whereby Dex- and Mstn-mediated atrophic signals are integrated through miR1, which then either directly or indirectly, inhibits the proteins involved in providing protection against atrophy."

Total and subscale HIV-related stigma scores were measured using the revised HIV-related Stigma Scale. Correlates of total stigma scores were assessed in univariate and multivariate linear regression. Women had significantly higher total and subscale stigma scores than men (total, median = 56.0 vs. 48.0, p<0.0001). Among men and women, Black individuals had the highest, Aboriginal and Asian/Latin-American/Unspecified people intermediate, and White individuals the lowest total stigma scores. The gender-ethnicity interaction term was significant in multivariate analysis: Black women and Asian/Latin-American/Unspecified men reported the highest HIV-related stigma scores. Gender and ethnicity differences in HIV-related stigma were identified in our cohort. Findings suggest differing approaches may be required to address HIV-related stigma based on gender and ethnicity; and such strategies should challenge racist and sexist stereotypes."

To understand the permeation properties of the CALHM1 ion channel in more detail, we examined permeation of different monovalent and divalent cations as well as different sized structurally similar ions using electrophysiological and optical imaging techniques. Both approaches indicate that the CALHM1 pore has a surprisingly wide diameter, comparable with that of gap junction-forming connexins. Furthermore, we show that, like connexons, a CALHM1 ion channel is a hexamer of CALHM1 monomers, each of which contains four transmembrane domains with cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini. Together, these functional and structural features suggest that CALHM1 belongs to a third protein family that is similar to connexins and pannexins/innexins.

In divalent cation-free solutions, 0.5 mm EGTA and 0.5 mm EDTA were added to the bath solutions without adding divalent cations. In ion permeability experiments, sucrose was used as a substitute for NaCl or Ca2+ to maintain osmolarity. Data were acquired with an OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments Corp.) at 1 kHz with 16-bit A/D converter (Instrutech ITC-16). Electrodes were made from thin walled TW100F-6 glass (World Precision Instruments, Inc.), filled with 3 m KCl, and connected by 3 m KCl agar bridges to the bath solution. Two different voltage protocols were used during this study. In the absence of divalent cations, CALHM1 channels have fast activation gating and cannot be closed even at very negative voltages (3Ma Z. Siebert A.P. Cheung K.H. Lee R.J. Johnson B. Cohen A.S.

Oocytes were clamped at resting membrane potential, which was measured at the beginning of each experiment. A short (250-ms) depolarization to +60 mV from resting membrane potential activated CALHM1 channels. The voltage was then immediately stepped to test pulses ranging from −80 to +40 mV in 10-mV increments every 15 s to record the instantaneous currents. When oocytes are bathed in divalent cation-containing solutions, activation gating is slowed and CALHM1 is stabilized in closed states (3Ma Z. Siebert A.P. Cheung K.H. Lee R.J. Johnson B. Cohen A.S.

Oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of −40 mV to close CALHM1 channels. A 2000-ms depolarization to +60 mV from −40 mV activated CALHM1. The voltage was then immediately stepped to test potentials from −80 to +40 mV in 10-mV increments every 15 s to measure the instantaneous currents. One additional step to −80 mV for 1000 ms was applied to ensure a lack of nonspecific leak during this protocol. Relative permeabilities of K+ and Cl− (PK and PCI, respectively) were estimated from reversal potentials (Erev) using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz constant field equation, Erev=RTFlnPKK+0+PNaNa+o+PCC−PKK+i+PNaNa+i+PCC−o(Eq. 1) where subscripts i and o denote intracellular and extracellular, respectively; R, T, and F have their usual meanings, and PNa, PK, and PCl are the membrane permeabilities to Na+, K+, and Cl−, respectively. For estimations of the relative divalent cation (M2+) permeability, the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation can be derived to an extended constant field equation, Erev=RTFln−b+b2−4ac2a(Eq. 2) a=Na+i+PClPNaCl−o+4PMPNaM2+i+PKPNaK++PMESPNaMES−o+PXPNaX+i(Eq. 3) and b=Na+i−Na+o−PClPNaCl−i−Cl−o+PKPNaK+i−K+o−PMESPNaMES−i−MES−o+PXPNaX+i−X+o(Eq. 4) and c=−Na+0−PClPNaCl−i−PKPNaK+0−4PMPNaM2+0−PMESPNaMES−i−PXPNaX+o(Eq. 5) where X+ is any other monovalent cation except for Na+ and K+, and PNa, PK, PCl, PMES, PX, and PM are the membrane permeabilities to Na+, K+, Cl−, MES−, X+, and M2+, respectively. The cytoplasmic ionic concentrations of Na+, K+, Cl−, and Ca2+ were assumed to be 7 mm, 98 mm, 37 mm, and 3 × 10−4 mm, respectively (8Weber W. Ion currents of Xenopus laevis oocytes.

When oocytes were bathed in solutions containing divalent cations, the ionic activities of the divalent cations were used instead of concentration. The ionic activity was calculated using Equation 6 (10Hamer W.J. Wu Y.-C. Osmotic coefficients and mean activity coefficients of univalent electrolytes in water at 25 °C.J. Phys. Chem. Ref.

Assuming a circular pore and spherical amines, the relationship between the relative permeability and ionic radius is as follows, PXPNa=A1−ar2(Eq. 9) where PX/PNa is the relative permeability, a is the radius of the amine compound, r is the radius of the pore, and A is a scaling factor. The second model includes a term for the viscous drag of the amine as a function of the size of the amine (a). This model is defined as follows, PxPNa=A1−ar2a(Eq. 10) where all terms are the same as above. CALHM1-expressing oocytes bathed in 5 mm Ca2+ solution were clamped at a holding membrane potential of −15 mV. CALHM1 currents induced by exposure to a nominally Ca2+-free solution containing 1 mm Mg2+ were measured in response to test pulses to −80 mV for 25 ms every 5 s. Following 180 s of exposure to nominally Ca2+-free solution, test agents were perfused into the bath for 180 s. 100 μm Gd3+ was applied for 180 s after perfusion of the tested agents, and the currents were normalized to those immediately preceding application of the test agents for each experiment. Averaged normalized currents (mean ± S.E.) are shown. N2a cells were transiently transfected with CALHM1 or empty vector. Experiments were performed 16–24 h post-transfection. Because extracellular Ca2+ modulates the gating of CALHM1, cells were incubated in dye-containing (0.1 mg/ml) Hanks' balanced saline solution (HBSS) for 8 min with Ca2+ (5 mm) to keep CALHM1 in closed states and thus inhibit dye uptake. The cells were then washed in 5 mm Ca2+ HBSS without dye to wash away excess extracellular dye. Alternatively, to activate CALHM1, cells were washed with HBSS containing 0.5 mm EGTA for 1 min. Then cells were incubated in nominally divalent cation-free HBSS containing dye (0.1 mg/ml) for 5 min. The cells were then incubated in dye-containing (0.1 mg/ml) HBSS with Ca2+ (5 mm) for 3 min to close CALHM1 and trap the dye inside the cells. Finally, the cells were washed in 5 mm Ca2+ HBSS without dye to remove excess extracellular dye. Differential interference contrast and fluorescence images were taken using the appropriate optical filters to visualize each dye. Fluorescence images were analyzed using ImageJ. The plasma membranes of healthy cells were traced on the differential interference contrast images to establish the regions of interest of a particular field of cells. The same regions of interest were used in the corresponding fluorescence image to measure the average fluorescent intensity of each cell. The off-cell background fluorescence was subtracted from the fluorescence of each cell to correct for any residual dye that had not been sufficiently washed away. A box plot was generated for each cell category for each dye. Because the fluorescent intensities of the CALHM1-activated cells were not normally distributed, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine statistical significance of median fluorescent intensities with an adjusted p value due to the multiple comparisons. 16–24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in standard lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (PhosSTOP; Roche Applied Science)). Samples were bath-sonicated at 4 °C for 10 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were used to determine protein concentrations (Bio-Rad DC protein assay method). 4× sample buffer (8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) was added to each sample before being boiled for 10 min. The percentage of β-mercaptoethanol (βME) was varied between 0.5 and 8%. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% Tris-HCl gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked at room temperature for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) with 5% nonfat milk. Membranes were washed in TBST and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in 5% milk/TBST. The CALHM1 antibody (gift from P. Marambaud; specifically recognizes the sequence 319EPPLMGNGWA328) concentration was 1:250, and the tubulin antibody (32-2600, Invitrogen) concentration was 1:2000. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, 1:5000 dilution in 5% milk/TBST) conjugated to HRP, followed by chemiluminescence detection (ECL-Plus reagent, Pierce) and exposure to HyBlot CL (Denville Scientific). To ensure equal loading, membranes were submerged in stripping buffer (Restore Western blot stripping buffer, Pierce) at 37 °C for 20 min and then reprobed with a loading control antibody, β-tubulin. Films were scanned. Blue Native PAGE (BN-PAGE) Western blotting was performed according to Invitrogen's recommended protocols. NativePAGETM reagents were acquired from Invitrogen. Transiently transfected SH-SY5Y cells were lysed in standard lysis solution (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1% Triton X-100). Appropriate volumes of NativePAGETM sample buffer (Invitrogen) were added, and an appropriate volume of NativePAGETM G-250 sample additive was introduced immediately before loading on a NativePAGETM Novex® 3–12% BisTris gel. NativeMarkTM unstained protein standard was added to the gel to estimate molecular mass. The Dark Blue Cathode Buffer was used until the dye front migrated through the first third of the gel. It was replaced with the Light Blue Cathode Buffer, and electrophoresis continued. The gel was run at 150 V for the first 60 min and then 250 V for the remainder of the time. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes using NuPAGE® transfer buffer at 180 mA for 60 min to transfer higher molecular mass proteins at 4 °C. The proteins were fixed on the membrane by shaking the membrane in 8% acetic acid for 15 min. Acetic acid was removed by rinsing the membrane in deionized water. Background dye was removed by shaking in methanol followed by washing in water. Standard Western blotting techniques, described above, were used to detect CALHM1. Single-molecule bleaching experiments were performed as described (15Penna A. Demuro A. Yeromin A.V. Zhang S.L. Safrina O. Parker I.

Defolliculated Xenopus oocytes were injected with cRNAs for human CALHM1-GFP 12–24 h before imaging. Individual CALHM1-GFP puncta were visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy using a home-built system (16Demuro A. Parker I. Optical single-channel recording. Imaging Ca2+ flux through individual ion channels with high temporal and spatial resolution.J. Biomed. Opt. 2005; 10: 11002Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) based on an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with a ×60, numerical aperture 1.45 TIRF objective. Devitellinated oocytes were allowed to settle on a coverglass forming the base of the recording chamber and were bathed in calcium-free Ringer's solution (containing 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). GFP-tagged molecules lying within the ∼100-nm evanescent field were excited by total internal reflection of a 488-nm laser beam incident through the microscope objective. Images (128 × 128 pixel; 1 pixel = 0.33 μm) were acquired at 10 frames s−1 by a Cascade 128+ electron multiplying CCD camera (Roper Scientific). The resulting image stacks were processed in MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) by subtraction of a heavily smoothed (7 × 7-pixel) copy of each frame to correct for bleaching of autofluorescence and other background signals. Traces, such as those in Fig. 3D (black data points), were then obtained from selected spots, excluding those that showed obvious movement or where spots were too close to be unambiguously separated. The number of bleaching steps in each trace was determined using the StepFinder algorithm, devised originally to find steps of single molecular motors (17Kerssemakers J.W. Munteanu E.L. Laan L.

The observed distribution of the number of bleaching steps was fitted with a binomial distribution, = Total Steps Bright Steps (1− Bright )(Total − steps )1−(1− Bright )Total (Eq. 11) where Total represents the total number of monomers in the multimer, Steps is the number of photobleaching steps, and Bright is the percentage of GFP molecules that are fluorescent. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with pIRES-CALHM1-EGFP2 or pIRES-EGFP2 alone. Two methods of immunostaining were used to distinguish between cytoplasmic or extracellular location of an epitope. For the permeabilized cell method, cells were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C and then fixed on ice with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by permeabilization for 30 min with 0.2% saponin at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS before incubating in primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed three times in PBS and incubated in secondary antibody (Alexa-Fluor secondary antibody) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed three times in PBS at room temperature. Cells were counterstained with DAPI. Using the unpermeabilized cell immunostaining protocol, cells were washed twice in PBS + 1% BSA, incubated in primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed twice in PBS before being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2165070320,"Endoglin (ENG), a co-receptor for several TGFβ-family cytokines, is expressed in dividing endothelial cells alongside ALK1, the ACVRL1 gene product. ENG and ACVRL1 are both required for angiogenesis and mutations in either gene are associated with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangectasia, a rare genetic vascular disorder. ENG and ALK1 function in the same genetic pathway but the relative contribution of TGFβ and BMP9 to SMAD1/5/8 activation and the requirement of ENG as a co-mediator of SMAD phosphorylation in endothelial cells remain debated. Here, we show that BMP9 and TGFβ1 induce distinct SMAD phosphorylation responses in primary human endothelial cells and that, unlike BMP9, TGFβ only induces SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in a subset of immortalized mouse endothelial cell lines, but not in primary human endothelial cells. We also demonstrate, using siRNA depletion of ENG and novel anti-ENG antibodies, that ENG is required for BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling in all human and mouse endothelial cells tested. Finally, anti-ENG antibodies that interfere with BMP9/pSMAD1 signaling, but not with TGFβ1/pSMAD3 signaling, also decrease in vitro HUVEC endothelial tube formation and inhibit BMP9 binding to recombinant ENG in vitro. Our data demonstrate that BMP9 signaling inhibition is a key and previously unreported mechanism of action of TRC105, an anti-angiogenic anti-Endoglin antibody currently evaluated in clinical trials."

https://openalex.org/W2086498140,"Propofol, a widely used intravenous general anesthetic, acts at anesthetic concentrations as a positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and at higher concentration as an inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here, we characterize propofol binding sites in a muscle-type nAChR by use of a photoreactive analog of propofol, 2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol (AziPm). Based upon radioligand binding assays, AziPm stabilized the Torpedo nAChR in the resting state, whereas propofol stabilized the desensitized state. nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled with [(3)H]AziPm, and labeled amino acids were identified by Edman degradation. [(3)H]AziPm binds at three sites within the nAChR transmembrane domain: (i) an intrasubunit site in the δ subunit helix bundle, photolabeling in the nAChR desensitized state (+agonist) δM2-18' and two residues in δM1 (δPhe-232 and δCys-236); (ii) in the ion channel, photolabeling in the nAChR resting, closed channel state (-agonist) amino acids in the M2 helices (αM2-6', βM2-6' and -13', and δM2-13') that line the channel lumen (with photolabeling reduced by >90% in the desensitized state); and (iii) at the γ-α interface, photolabeling αM2-10'. Propofol enhanced [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling at αM2-10'. Propofol inhibited [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling within the δ subunit helix bundle at lower concentrations (IC50 = 40 μm) than it inhibited ion channel photolabeling (IC50 = 125 μm). These results identify for the first time a single intrasubunit propofol binding site in the nAChR transmembrane domain and suggest that this is the functionally relevant inhibitory binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2091667439,"Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the α(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy."

https://openalex.org/W2098611570,"Normal bone turnover requires tight coupling of bone resorption and bone formation to preserve bone quantity and structure. With aging and during several pathological conditions, this coupling breaks down, leading to either net bone loss or excess bone formation. To preserve or restore normal bone metabolism, it is crucial to determine the mechanisms by which osteoclasts and osteoblast precursors interact and contribute to coupling. We showed that osteoclasts produce the chemokine sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which stimulates osteoblast migration. Thus, osteoclast-derived S1P may recruit osteoblasts to sites of bone resorption as an initial step in replacing lost bone. In this study we investigated the mechanisms by which S1P stimulates mesenchymal (skeletal) cell chemotaxis. S1P treatment of mesenchymal (skeletal) cells activated RhoA GTPase, but this small G protein did not contribute to migration. Rather, two S1P receptors, S1PR1 and S1PR2, coordinately promoted migration through activation of the JAK/STAT3 and FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, respectively. These data demonstrate that the chemokine S1P couples bone formation to bone resorption through activation of kinase signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2100948940,"Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) has become an accepted treatment for patients experiencing the motor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD). While its successes are becoming increasingly apparent, the mechanisms underlying its action remain unclear. Multiple studies using radiotracer-based imaging have investigated DBS-induced regional changes in neural activity. However, little is known about the effect of DBS on connectivity within neural networks; in other words, whether DBS impacts upon functional integration of specialized regions of cortex. In this work, we report the first findings of fMRI in 10 subjects with PD and fully implanted DBS hardware receiving efficacious stimulation. Despite the technical demands associated with the safe acquisition of fMRI data from patients with implanted hardware, robust activation changes were identified in the insula cortex and thalamus in response to therapeutic STN DBS. We then quantified the neuromodulatory effects of DBS and compared sixteen dynamic causal models of effective connectivity between the two identified nodes. Using Bayesian model comparison, we found unequivocal evidence for the modulation of extrinsic (between region), i.e. cortico-thalamic and thalamo-cortical connections. Using Bayesian model parameter averaging we found that during voluntary movements, DBS reversed the effective connectivity between regions of the cortex and thalamus. This casts the therapeutic effects of DBS in a fundamentally new light, emphasising a role in changing distributed cortico-subcortical interactions. We conclude that STN DBS does impact upon the effective connectivity between the cortex and thalamus by changing their sensitivities to extrinsic afferents. Furthermore, we confirm that fMRI is both feasible and is tolerated well by these patients provided strict safety measures are adhered to."

https://openalex.org/W2029961929,"IL-12 is a 70-kDa heterodimeric cytokine composed of the p35 and p40 subunits. To maximize cytokine production from plasmid DNA, molecular steps controlling IL-12p70 biosynthesis at the posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels were investigated. We show that the combination of RNA/codon-optimized gene sequences and fine-tuning of the relative expression levels of the two subunits within a cell resulted in increased production of the IL-12p70 heterodimer. We found that the p40 subunit plays a critical role in enhancing the stability, intracellular trafficking, and export of the p35 subunit. This posttranslational regulation mediated by the p40 subunit is conserved in mammals. Based on these findings, dual gene expression vectors were generated, producing an optimal ratio of the two subunits, resulting in a ∼1 log increase in human, rhesus, and murine IL-12p70 production compared with vectors expressing the wild type sequences. Such optimized DNA plasmids also produced significantly higher levels of systemic bioactive IL-12 upon in vivo DNA delivery in mice compared with plasmids expressing the wild type sequences. A single therapeutic injection of an optimized murine IL-12 DNA plasmid showed significantly more potent control of tumor development in the B16 melanoma cancer model in mice. Therefore, the improved IL-12p70 DNA vectors have promising potential for in vivo use as molecular vaccine adjuvants and in cancer immunotherapy. IL-12 is a 70-kDa heterodimeric cytokine composed of the p35 and p40 subunits. To maximize cytokine production from plasmid DNA, molecular steps controlling IL-12p70 biosynthesis at the posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels were investigated. We show that the combination of RNA/codon-optimized gene sequences and fine-tuning of the relative expression levels of the two subunits within a cell resulted in increased production of the IL-12p70 heterodimer. We found that the p40 subunit plays a critical role in enhancing the stability, intracellular trafficking, and export of the p35 subunit. This posttranslational regulation mediated by the p40 subunit is conserved in mammals. Based on these findings, dual gene expression vectors were generated, producing an optimal ratio of the two subunits, resulting in a ∼1 log increase in human, rhesus, and murine IL-12p70 production compared with vectors expressing the wild type sequences.

https://openalex.org/W1991689280,"Characterizing how cells in three-dimensional (3D) environments or natural tissues respond to biophysical stimuli is a longstanding challenge in biology and tissue engineering. We demonstrate a strategy to monitor morphological and mechanical responses of contractile fibroblasts in a 3D environment. Cells responded to stretch through specific, cell-wide mechanisms involving staged retraction and reinforcement. Retraction responses occurred for all orientations of stress fibers and cellular protrusions relative to the stretch direction, while reinforcement responses, including extension of cellular processes and stress fiber formation, occurred predominantly in the stretch direction. A previously unreported role of F-actin clumps was observed, with clumps possibly acting as F-actin reservoirs for retraction and reinforcement responses during stretch. Responses were consistent with a model of cellular sensitivity to local physical cues. These findings suggest mechanisms for global actin cytoskeleton remodeling in non-muscle cells and provide insight into cellular responses important in pathologies such as fibrosis and hypertension."

We identified two sequences in TGD4, amino acids 1–80 and 110–145, which are necessary and sufficient for PtdOH binding. Deletion of both sequences abolished PtdOH binding activity.

https://openalex.org/W2105815548,"Background Depression is associated with increased HIV transmission risk, increased morbidity, and higher risk of HIV-related death among HIV-infected women. Low sexual relationship power also contributes to HIV risk, but there is limited understanding of how it relates to mental health among HIV-infected women. Methods Participants were 270 HIV-infected women from the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes study, a prospective cohort of individuals initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Mbarara, Uganda. Our primary predictor was baseline sexual relationship power as measured by the Sexual Relationship Power Scale (SRPS). The primary outcome was depression severity, measured with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL), and a secondary outcome was a functional scale for mental health status (MHS). Adjusted models controlled for socio-demographic factors, CD4 count, alcohol and tobacco use, baseline WHO stage 4 disease, social support, and duration of ART. Results The mean HSCL score was 1.34 and 23.7% of participants had HSCL scores consistent with probable depression (HSCL>1.75). Compared to participants with low SRPS scores, individuals with both moderate (coefficient b = −0.21; 95%CI, −0.36 to −0.07) and high power (b = −0.21; 95%CI, −0.36 to −0.06) reported decreased depressive symptomology. High SRPS scores halved the likelihood of women meeting criteria for probable depression (adjusted odds ratio = 0.44; 95%CI, 0.20 to 0.93). In lagged models, low SRPS predicted subsequent depression severity, but depression did not predict subsequent changes in SPRS. Results were similar for MHS, with lagged models showing SRPS predicts subsequent mental health, but not visa versa. Both Decision-Making Dominance and Relationship Control subscales of SRPS were associated with depression symptom severity. Conclusions HIV-infected women with high sexual relationship power had lower depression and higher mental health status than women with low power. Interventions to improve equity in decision-making and control within dyadic partnerships are critical to prevent HIV transmission and to optimize mental health of HIV-infected women."
https://openalex.org/W1999012444,"The epithelial Ca(2+) channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 6 (TRPV6) undergoes Ca(2+)-induced inactivation that protects the cell from toxic Ca(2+) overload and may also limit intestinal Ca(2+) transport. To dissect the roles of individual signaling pathways in this phenomenon, we studied the effects of Ca(2+), calmodulin (CaM), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) in excised inside-out patches. The activity of TRPV6 strictly depended on the presence of PI(4,5)P(2), and Ca(2+)-CaM inhibited the channel at physiologically relevant concentrations. Ca(2+) alone also inhibited TRPV6 at high concentrations (IC(50) = ∼20 μM). A double mutation in the distal C-terminal CaM-binding site of TRPV6 (W695A/R699E) essentially eliminated inhibition by CaM in excised patches. In whole cell patch clamp experiments, this mutation reduced but did not eliminate Ca(2+)-induced inactivation. Providing excess PI(4,5)P(2) reduced the inhibition by CaM in excised patches and in planar lipid bilayers, but PI(4,5)P(2) did not inhibit binding of CaM to the C terminus of the channel. Overall, our data show a complex interplay between CaM and PI(4,5)P(2) and show that Ca(2+), CaM, and the depletion of PI(4,5)P(2) all contribute to inactivation of TRPV6."
https://openalex.org/W2061309137,"Diacylglycerol (DAG) controls numerous cell functions by regulating the localization of C1-domain-containing proteins, including protein kinase C (PKC), but little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of the lipid. Here, we explored plasma membrane DAG dynamics in pancreatic β cells and determined whether DAG signaling is involved in secretagogue-induced pulsatile release of insulin. Single MIN6 cells, primary mouse β cells, and human β cells within intact islets were transfected with translocation biosensors for DAG, PKC activity, or insulin secretion and imaged with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Muscarinic receptor stimulation triggered stable, homogenous DAG elevations, whereas glucose induced short-lived (7.1 ± 0.4 s) but high-amplitude elevations (up to 109 ± 10% fluorescence increase) in spatially confined membrane regions. The spiking was mimicked by membrane depolarization and suppressed after inhibition of exocytosis or of purinergic P2Y₁, but not P2X receptors, reflecting involvement of autocrine purinoceptor activation after exocytotic release of ATP. Each DAG spike caused local PKC activation with resulting dissociation of its substrate protein MARCKS from the plasma membrane. Inhibition of spiking reduced glucose-induced pulsatile insulin secretion. Thus, stimulus-specific DAG signaling patterns appear in the plasma membrane, including distinct microdomains, which have implications for the kinetic control of exocytosis and other membrane-associated processes."
https://openalex.org/W2116515528,"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a prime candidate crop for biofuel feedstock production in the United States. As it is a self-incompatible polyploid perennial species, breeding elite and stable switchgrass cultivars with traditional breeding methods is very challenging. Translational genomics may contribute significantly to the genetic improvement of switchgrass, especially for the incorporation of elite traits that are absent in natural switchgrass populations.In this study, we constitutively expressed an Arabidopsis NAC transcriptional factor gene, LONG VEGETATIVE PHASE ONE (AtLOV1), in switchgrass. Overexpression of AtLOV1 in switchgrass caused the plants to have a smaller leaf angle by changing the morphology and organization of epidermal cells in the leaf collar region. Also, overexpression of AtLOV1 altered the lignin content and the monolignol composition of cell walls, and caused delayed flowering time. Global gene-expression analysis of the transgenic plants revealed an array of responding genes with predicted functions in plant development, cell wall biosynthesis, and flowering.To our knowledge, this is the first report of a single ectopically expressed transcription factor altering the leaf angle, cell wall composition, and flowering time of switchgrass, therefore demonstrating the potential advantage of translational genomics for the genetic improvement of this crop."

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)3 is a master regulator of cell growth and division that is responsive to numerous signaling pathways including growth factors, nutrients, and energy supply. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis is a desirable target for the treatment of cancer because it integrates multiple pathways critical for cell growth. mTOR assembles into two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), each of which has unique substrates (1Kim D.H.

Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Growing roles for the mTOR pathway.Curr. Opin.

Rapamycin is a macrolide fungicide isolated from the bacteria Streptomyces hygroscopicus. When bound to the FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) it inhibits the serine/threonine kinase activity of mTORC1 as well as the translation of specific cell cycle mRNAs (required for G1 to S phase transition), ultimately leading to growth arrest (6Nourse J.

As opposed to mTORC1, mTORC2 is disrupted only by prolonged rapamycin treatment (>24 h) resulting in inhibition of Akt signaling. Rapamycin inhibits mTORC2 in only ∼20% of the cancer cell lines studied (7Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P. Bagley A.F. Markhard A.L. Sabatini D.M.

In the present study, we show that oncogenic miRNAs are significantly up-regulated and tumor suppressor miRNAs are down-regulated in rapamycin-resistant cells. Inhibitors of these oncogenic miRNAs (miR-17 and miR-19) or mimics of the tumor suppressor miRNAs (let-7) restored rapamycin sensitivity in resistant tumor cells. BC3H1 cells, a mouse brain tumor cell line with myogenic properties (ATCC), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Rapamycin-resistant cells (RR1 or RR3) were developed by culturing BC3H1 cells in the presence of 1 or 0.1 μm rapamycin, respectively, for 6 months as described previously (32Luo Y. Marx S.O.

Total RNA was extracted from BC3H1 cells cultured in the presence of 100 nm rapamycin (BC3H1+R cells) or DMSO (BC3H1) for 24 h, and RR1 cells were cultured continuously in the presence of 1 μm rapamycin (RR1+R) or with DMSO for one week (RR1). All experiments were performed in quadruplicate. For each experiment, 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was labeled with Hy3TM dye, and a reference RNA pool (consisting of a mixture of equal amounts of total RNA from BC3H1, BC3H1+R, RR1 and RR1+R cells) was labeled with Hy5TM dye using the miRCURYTM labeling kit. The samples were hybridized to Exiqon miRCURYTM LNA arrays (version 10.0), which contained 417 mouse-specific capture probes (representing 417 miRNAs).

Following hypothesis testing, we corrected for multiple tests controlling for the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction and an accepted α ≤ 0.05 (38Benjamini Y. Y.H.Y. Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from quadruplicates of BC3H1, BC3H1+R, RR1 and RR1+R cell cultures treated as described above. All RNA samples had a 28S/18S rRNA ratio of ∼2 on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gels and 260 nm/280 nm absorbance ratios between 1.9 and 2.1. Ten μg of each RNA sample was used for target preparation, using a one-cycle cDNA synthesis kit, and hybridized to GeneChip® Whole Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), which contain 45,000 probe sets representative of over 39,000 transcripts and variants from over 34,000 well characterized murine genes. The arrays were washed and stained using the Affymetrix 450 Fluidics station and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000, enabled for high resolution scanning. GeneChip® operating software v1.4 (Affymetrix) was used to determine the expression level and “present,” “absent,” or “marginal” calls for each probe set. The mRNA expression data were normalized with GC-RMA (39Wu Z. Irizarry R.A. Stochastic models inspired by hybridization theory for short oligonucleotide arrays.J. Comput. Biol. 2005; 12: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To evaluate global changes in gene expression relative to miRNA dysregulation we plotted the empirical cumulative distribution function of changes in mRNA expression by subsets of transcripts. Transcript subsets were determined according to TargetScan predictions for the respective miRNAs (TargetScanMouse, release 6.0) (40Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9862) Google Scholar). Differential mRNA expression was derived from Affymetrix array hybridization signals. Of 45,501 probe sets on the Affymetrix arrays, 45,037 had corresponding transcripts in the TargetScan database; the change in expression of genes in this list served as the reference distribution against which miRNA target subsets were evaluated. Cumulative distribution function plots and respective Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed within the R framework. TaqMan microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to quantify mature miRNAs. cDNA was synthesized by priming with miRNA-specific looped primers or with snoRNA55 as an endogenous control. Total RNA (100 ng) extracted with the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) was used for each reverse transcription reaction according to the manufacturer's specifications, incubated for 30 min at 16 °C, 30 min at 42 °C, and 5 min at 85 °C, and stored at 4 °C. PCR was performed using 4.5 ng of cDNA, 1× TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (P/N 4324018, Applied Biosystems), and TaqMan® MicroRNA assay. All reactions, excluding no-template controls and non-reverse transcribed controls, were run in triplicate and incubated in 96-well plates at 95 °C for 20 seconds followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 seconds and 60 °C for 30 seconds using the ABI 7500 Fast Real Time PCR detection system. Real-time PCR data were analyzed using the comparative CT method, with normalization against the expression of snoRNA55. For gene expression analyses, 0.5 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNAs using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Real-time PCR was carried out using a LightCycler 1.5 (Roche Applied Science) with the LightCycler TaqMan master mix. For Myc, we used universal probe 77 with 5′-CCTAGTGCTGCATGAGGAGA-3′ forward primer and 5′-TCTTCCTCATCTTCTTGCTCTTC-3′ reverse primer; for Tgif2 we used universal probe 106 with 5′-CGCGAGAATGGCTATTTGTAA-3′ forward primer and 5′-AGCCTGCTGGGTCTCCTAC-3′ reverse primer; and for Thbs1 we used universal probe 9 with 5′-CAGGCCAAAGACCGGTTA-3′ forward primer and 5′-CCGAGTCAGCCATGATTTTC-3′ reverse primer. The amplification efficiencies were 1.909 for Myc, 1.993 for Tgif2, and 1.875 for Thbs1. Cells growing in 10-cm diameter dishes were rinsed once with cold PBS and lysed for 20 min in ice-cold buffer A (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mMNaF, 0.5 mm orthovanadate, and EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) containing 0.3% CHAPS. After clearing of the lysates by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, samples containing 50 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to PVDF and visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against Akt, phospho-Ser-473 Akt, S6K1, phospho-Thr-389 S6K1, GSK, p-GSKβ, Myc, and GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technologies) using infrared-labeled secondary antibodies (1:10,000, LI-COR Biosystems). BC3H1 or RR1 cells (5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates) were transfected in triplicate wells with Myc-specific siRNA or control siRNA (OriGene Technologies, Inc.) at a final concentration of 10 nm or with miRIDIAN microRNA mimics or miRNA hairpin inhibitors (antagomirs, Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific) at a final concentration of 100 nm or as indicated using the DharmaFECT transfection reagent. 16 h later, cells were treated with or without 100 nm rapamycin and counted after 3 days of incubation. Myc cDNA (accession number NM_010849) was amplified using forward primer 5′-AAAGAGCTCCTCGAGCTGTTTGAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TACTCTCACGAGAGATTCCAGCTCCTCC-3′ inserted into pcDNA3.1+ plasmid (Invitrogen) using BamHI and EcoRI unique restriction sites. BC3H1 (5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates) were transfected with Myc-expressing plasmid or mock using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications; total RNA was extracted after a 48-h incubation. The potent anti-proliferative effect of mTOR inhibitors makes them attractive for cancer therapy, with numerous ongoing clinical trials evaluating their potential for treating malignancies (11Faivre S. Kroemer G. Raymond E. Current development of mTOR inhibitors as anticancer agents.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 671-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). However, rapamycin and its analogues (temsirolimus and everolimus) have shown modest success in clinical trials, reflecting an incomplete understanding of mTOR functions. To investigate the role of miRNAs in the cellular response to mTOR inhibition, we studied the molecular changes associated with the development of rapamycin resistance in a murine myogenic cell line, BC3H1 (derived from a mouse brain tumor), and in rapamycin-resistant (RR1) cells developed in our laboratory by prolonged culturing of BC3H1 cells in the presence of 1 μm rapamycin without mutagenesis (32Luo Y. Marx S.O. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Massagué J. Marks A.R. Rapamycin resistance tied to defective regulation of p27Kip1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As shown previously, rapamycin inhibited cell growth of the parental BC3H1 cells but not of the RR1 cells (Fig. 1A). It has been proposed that the ability of rapamycin to inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 accounts for its potent anti-proliferative effect (7Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.H. Hsu P.P.

Uncoupling p70(s6) kinase activation and proliferation: rapamycin-resistant proliferation of human CD8(+) T lymphocytes.J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3201-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test whether the resistance to rapamycin was due to a lack of inhibition of mTORC1 or mTORC2, we compared the effect of 1- and 24-h treatment with 100 nm rapamycin on the phosphorylation of Thr-389-S6K1, a target of mTORC1 in exponentially growing BC3H1 or RR1 cells. Furthermore, we compared the phosphorylation of Ser-473-Akt and GSK targets of mTORC2 and Akt, respectively. One hour of rapamycin treatment inhibited mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 in both BC3H1 and RR1 cells. Because S6K1 normally suppresses the PI3K/Akt pathway (44O'Reilly K.E. Rojo F. She Q.B. Solit D. Mills G.B. Smith D. Lane H. Hofmann F. Hicklin D.J. Ludwig D.L. Baselga J.

Absence of S6K1 protects against age- and diet-induced obesity while enhancing insulin sensitivity.Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar), inhibition of S6K1 by rapamycin resulted in increased phosphorylation of Akt and consequently GSKβ (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, 24 h of rapamycin treatment inhibited both mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways in BC3H1 and RR1 cells, as shown by the dephosphorylation of Thr-389-S6K1, Ser-473-Akt, and p-GSKβ. These results indicate that the mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways are inhibited by rapamycin in the same fashion in both BC3H1+R and RR1+R cells. Therefore the development of rapamycin resistance observed in RR1 cells cannot be attributed to a lack of inhibition of mTORC1 or mTORC2. Global miRNA expression profiling was performed in BC3H1 cells treated with DMSO or 100 nm rapamycin for 24 h (BC3H1 and BC3H1+R, respectively) or in RR1 cells cultured with DMSO for 1 week (RR1) or constantly treated with 1 μm rapamycin (RR1+R). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of normalized hybridization signals identified four distinct groups corresponding to the experimental conditions (Fig. 2A). One sample from the BC3H1 untreated group (BC3H1–3) was excluded for further analysis because it did not pass quality controls (Fig. 2A). Principle component analysis showed sample separation between rapamycin-sensitive cells and rapamycin-resistant cells on component 1 (PC1), whereas on component 2 (PC2) the sample separation was based on rapamycin treatment (Fig. 2B). The main contributors to the sample separation of the PC1 were 23 miRNAs, whereas 28 miRNAs contributed to PC2 (Fig. 2, C and D, and Table 1).TABLE 1miRNAs contributing to PC1 and PC2TABLE 1miRNAs contributing to PC1 and PC2 To identify miRNAs associated with rapamycin resistance, we evaluated the miRNA expression profiles of rapamycin-resistant and -sensitive cells by three pairwise comparisons: RR versus BC3H1, RR1+R versus BC3H1+R, and RR+R versus BC3H1. Twenty miRNAs were significantly changed (>2-fold, p < 0.001) in RR1 cells compared with BC3H1 cells (Table 2, left columns). RR1+R cells showed significant changes (>2-fold, p < 0.001) in 18 miRNAs compared with BC3H1+R and in 16 miRNAs when compared with BC3H1 (Table 2, middle and right columns). Sixteen miRNAs were similarly changed in all three comparisons (Table 2, shown in bold). The 10 up-regulated miRNAs in resistant cells were miR-370 and members of the miR-17–92 and its related miR-106a-92 and miR-106b-25 clusters (miR-25 was increased 1.3-fold; data not shown), which have oncogenic properties (46Olive V.

https://openalex.org/W1974473658,"The adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to human tissues or endothelium is central to the pathology caused by the parasite during malaria. It contributes to the avoidance of parasite clearance by the spleen and to the specific pathologies of cerebral and placental malaria. The PfEMP1 family of adhesive proteins is responsible for this sequestration by mediating interactions with diverse human ligands. In addition, as the primary targets of acquired, protective immunity, the PfEMP1s are potential vaccine candidates. PfEMP1s contain large extracellular ectodomains made from CIDR (cysteine-rich interdomain regions) and DBL (Duffy-binding-like) domains and show extensive variation in sequence, size, and domain organization. Here we use biophysical methods to characterize the entire ∼300-kDa ectodomain from IT4VAR13, a protein that interacts with the host receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). We show through small angle x-ray scattering that IT4VAR13 is rigid, elongated, and monomeric. We also show that it interacts with ICAM-1 through the DBLβ domain alone, forming a 1:1 complex. These studies provide a first low resolution structural view of a PfEMP1 ectodomain in complex with its ligand. They show that it combines a modular domain arrangement consisting of individual ligand binding domains, with a defined higher order architecture that exposes the ICAM-1 binding surface to allow adhesion."

The effects on dentinal tubule occlusion and surface mineralization were compared after brushing dentine discs with dentifrice with or without HA. The two types of dentifrice were then added to 100 µg/ml of hexavalent chromium cation (Cr6+) solution in order to evaluate their capacities of adsorbing Cr6+ from water. Our results showed that the dentifrice containing HA was significantly better than the ordinary dentifrice in occluding the dentinal tubules with a plugging rate greater than 90%. Moreover, the effect of the HA dentifrice was persistent and energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) revealed that the atomic percentages of calcium and phosphorus on the surface of dentine discs increased significantly. Adding HA to ordinary dentifrice significantly enhanced the ability of dentifrice to adsorb Cr6+ from water with the removal rate up to 52.36%. In addition, the sorption was stable. Our study suggests that HA can be added to ordinary dentifrice to obtain dentifrice that has both relieving dentin hypersensitivity benefits and also helps to control environmental pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2043952726,"The biogenesis of peroxisomes is mediated by peroxins (PEXs). PEX7 is a cytosolic receptor that imports peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 (PTS2)-containing proteins. Although PEX7 is important for protein transport, the mechanisms that mediate its function are unknown. In this study, we performed proteomic analysis to identify PEX7-binding proteins using transgenic Arabidopsis expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PEX7. Our analysis identified RabE1c, a small GTPase, as a PEX7 binding partner. In vivo analysis revealed that GTP-bound RabE1c binds to PEX7 and that a subset of RabE1c localizes to peroxisomes and interacts with PEX7 on the peroxisome membrane. Unlike endogenous PEX7, which is predominantly localized to the cytosol, GFP-PEX7 accumulates abnormally on the peroxisomal membrane and induces degradation of endogenous PEX7, concomitant with a reduction in import of PTS2-containing proteins and decreased peroxisomal β-oxidation activity. Thus, GFP-PEX7 on the peroxisomal membrane exerts a dominant negative effect. Mutation of RabE1c restored endogenous PEX7 protein expression and import of PTS2-containing proteins as well as peroxisomal β-oxidation activity. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors also restored endogenous PEX7 protein levels in GFP-PEX7-expressing seedlings. Based on these findings, we conclude that RabE1c binds PEX7 and facilitates PEX7 degradation in the presence of immobile GFP-PEX7 accumulated at the membrane."

Titin is the first sarcomeric protein linked to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. To characterize the disease mechanism, we have used atomic force microscopy to directly measure the effects that the disease-linked point mutation (T16I) has on the mechanical and kinetic stability of Ig10 at the single molecule level. The mutation decreases the force needed to unfold Ig10 and increases its rate of unfolding 4-fold. We also found that T16I Ig10 is more prone to degradation, presumably due to compromised local protein structure.

Biochemical assays allow the study of protein degradation under various proteolytic conditions. The disease-linked mutation is a C→T nucleotide transition found in exon 37 of the titin gene (4.Taylor M. Graw S. Sinagra G. Barnes C. Slavov D. Brun F. Pinamonti B. Salcedo E.E. Sauer W. Pyxaras S.

Exon 37 encodes for the tenth Ig domain in the proximal tandem Ig segment of the I-band, and the mutation changes the native threonine residue into isoleucine. This mutation is referred to as T16I (threonine is the 16th residue from the N terminus of Ig10). From homology modeling and secondary structure prediction (19.Pieper U. Webb B.M. Barkan D.T.

Different molecular mechanics displayed by titin's constitutively and differentially expressed tandem Ig segments.J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), this is the first time a naturally occurring Ig mutation has been studied using AFM and the first time an Ig domain in titin's elastic I-band region has been linked to cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesize that the T16I mutation alters the conformation of Ig10 and increases its propensity to exist in a non-native, unfolded state. T16I Ig10 may then be susceptible to protease cleavage, which would completely abolish titin's force generation mechanism and would probably lead to pathological remodeling (27.LeWinter M.M. Granzier H. Cardiac titin. A multifunctional giant.Circulation. 2010; 121: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A critical first step toward elucidating the relationship between mutated Ig10 and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies is determination of the functional effect of the T16I mutation at the single molecule level. Two Ig10 pentamers (five identical Ig10 domains linked in series) were created: Ig10 wild type and Ig10 mutant. The mutant 5-mer contains the single AC-linked amino acid mutation (T16I) in all five Ig domains. To best mimic the native rotational constraints on Ig10, the linker sequence between Ig10 domains in the WT and T16I pentamers was chosen such that each Ig10 domain was flanked by the native residue at each terminus (Pro at the C terminus and Glu at the N terminus). This resulted in an Ig10(PE(Ig10))4 construct. We also expressed a naturally occurring fragment containing seven Ig domains (Ig7–13) and a mutant version of this heteropolyprotein in which the only difference is the T16I mutation in Ig10. Synthetic DNA coding for five human Ig10 domains connected in series and Ig7–13 was purchased from Geneart (Regensburg, Germany), inserted into vectors, and expressed in Escherichia coli. All constructs were inserted into pETM11 vectors except for Ig7–13 WT, which was inserted in pET9D for technical reasons. Protein expression and purification were performed using standard methods (28.Zhu Y. Bogomolovas J. Labeit S. Granzier H. Single molecule force spectroscopy of the cardiac titin N2B element.

The mechanical and kinetic properties of purified Ig10 5-mers were probed with an MFP3D atomic force microscope from Asylum Research (Santa Barbara, CA). Freshly thawed recombinant protein in buffer (25 mm BES, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm NaATP, 165 mm KCl, pH 7.0) was spotted on gold-coated microscope slides at ∼5–10 μg/ml and incubated at 4 °C for at least 1 h. The Ig10 5-mers were engineered with two C-terminal cysteines to allow thiol-gold bonds to anchor the protein to the slide surface. Few functional groups besides thiols bind strongly to gold (29.Dubois L. Nuzzo R. Synthesis, structure, and properties of model organic surfaces.Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1992; 43: 437-463Crossref Scopus (1773) Google Scholar), so exploiting the thiol-gold bond encourages the protein's short C-terminal extension to attach to the slide surface while discouraging nonspecific binding between the globular Ig domains and gold slide. Unbound molecules were removed from the slide through pipette rinses with buffer. Surface protein density was kept low to minimize protein-protein interactions and the probability of multiple molecules attaching to the atomic force microscope tip simultaneously. With one end of the polyprotein attached to the slide surface, a piezo-controlled silicon nitride cantilever tip (MLCT, Veeco Probes, Plainview, NY) was driven toward the protein-coated surface from above and nonspecifically adsorbed protein. The end-to-end distance of the Ig10 5-mer was constrained between the slide and the cantilever tip, and the molecule was stretched along this axis as the cantilever retracted from the slide surface at 1000 nm/s. This constant velocity stretching generates a force versus displacement curve that characterizes the elastic and mechanical properties of the tethered protein. The displacement of the cantilever base was determined directly via an integrated linear voltage differential transformer. To determine the force exerted on the molecule as the tip was pulled away from the surface, Hooke's law (F = −kx) was used, where F(x) is the force needed to extend the molecule a given distance, x is the distance away from equilibrium the cantilever is bent, and k is the spring constant of the cantilever. Cantilever stiffness was established by measuring its mean thermally driven vertical displacement (x) and then applying the equipartition theorem k〈x2〉 = kBT, where kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is absolute temperature. Stiffness is typically 20–25 pN/nm. To accurately measure the force-displacement relationship of the Ig pentamer, the end-to-end length of the tethered molecule was corrected for cantilever bending. As a tethered Ig pentamer is stretched, force develops in the molecule until a single Ig10 unfolding event occurs. When an Ig domain unravels from a native, compact state to a denatured, extended state, the contour length of the entire 5-mer is increased by ∼28 nm (the diameter of a folded Ig domain is ∼5 nm, and the backbone contour length of the unfolded Ig10 polypeptide is 87 amino acids × 0.38 nm/amino acid = 33 nm). This sudden increase in contour length following a high force unfolding event results in an identifiable “force peak.” This process of polyprotein extension and unfolding continues until all serially linked Ig domains have unfolded or until the protein is displaced from the cantilever tip. Because the thiol-gold bond approaches covalent strengths (∼44 kcal/mol) (29.Dubois L. Nuzzo R. Synthesis, structure, and properties of model organic surfaces.Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1992; 43: 437-463Crossref Scopus (1773) Google Scholar), the molecule is much more likely to be displaced from the cantilever tip than from the slide surface. These successive unfolding events generate a characteristic sawtooth pattern; this “molecular fingerprint” is used to determine when a single Ig10 5-mer is being stretched. If more than five low force peaks are present or if consecutive force peaks are not separated by ∼28 nm periodicity, the tip has attached to multiple pentamers at once; these data are not analyzed. Stretch-relaxation-restretch was also implemented to directly measure the refolding rate of WT and T16I Ig10. A standard force-extension trace was overridden by a secondary trigger that initialized a user-defined drive wave that controls piezoelectric position. For the stretch-relaxation-restretch protocol, the number of unfolded domains that were allowed to refold was limited by the molecular extension during the low force hold. For example, in Fig. 6, the molecule was relaxed to the middle of the first Ig10 unfolding peak at ∼25 nm extension (the first blue peak is adhesion between the cantilever tip and slide surface). Although there are four unfolding peaks in the initial extension, only three domains can possibly refold during the hold time (which is at an extension of ∼25–30 nm) because the fourth refolding event would require ∼50 pN of bend in the cantilever tip (i.e. the force needed to extend four folded domains to 25–30 nm during the initial stretch). The energy required to bend a cantilever tip (k = 20 pN/nm) by this amount is 63 pN·nm, which is 15 times larger than kBT; therefore, the fourth unfolded Ig domain is prohibited from refolding. Force clamp AFM protocols were also performed to measure force-dependent unfolding. The force clamp protocol uses a feedback mechanism to maintain tension in a tethered 5-mer following Ig unfolding. For each unfolding event, we measured the time interval Δti between the start of the force clamp and the unfolding event. It takes tens of milliseconds for the feedback to reestablish the force clamp, and this time was subtracted from the raw time data to correct for the amount of time that the 5-mer is not held at the clamp force. For two-step unfolding, Δti was taken from the start of the force clamp to the time of the second unfolding transition. Because actual hold forces varied slightly between tethered molecules, we analyzed data in 5 pN bins (i.e. data from clamps between 53 and 57 pN were analyzed together and considered as 55 pN; root mean square force noise is ∼7 pN). Although the Ig10 pentamers contain identical domains, average unfolding force increases with peak number (Table 1). To increase the robustness of fits between simulated and experimental data, we removed this peak dependence and thus reduced the spread in our data. Order statistics theory (30.Zhmurov A. Dima R.I. Barsegov V. Order statistics theory of unfolding of multimeric proteins.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 1959-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was implemented to generate a parent distribution of unfolding force (describing a single isolated domain) from data gathered from unfolding of Ig10 pentamers, ψ(f)=1−1−φ1:n−1+1(f)1/(n−1+1)(Eq. 1) where Ψ represents the parent cumulative distribution function (cdf) and ϕ is the cumulative distribution function of the lth unfolding force peaks of a homopolyprotein of length n.TABLE 1Average unfolding force ± S.E. of each peak for 1000 nm/s pulling velocityAverage unfolding forcePeak 1Peak 2Peak 3Peak 4Peak 5pNWT120 ± 2124 ± 2128 ± 2134 ± 2143 ± 4T16I92 ± 2ap < 0.001.97 ± 3ap < 0.001.106 ± 2ap < 0.001.117 ± 2ap < 0.001.126 ± 4bp < 0.01.a p < 0.001.b p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Monte Carlo methods were used to simulate AFM force-extension traces. Starting from five serially linked Ig domains with a defined unfolding rate at zero force (α0) and distance along the reaction coordinate from the folded state to the transition state (Δxu), the molecule was stretched at 1000 nm/s (mimicking AFM experiments). At each time point, the force acting on the 5-mer was determined from force balance between cantilever bend (set at 22 pN/nm) and the force required to stretch the polypeptide (the combination of unfolded and folded domains) using the wormlike chain equation (31.Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Stretching DNA.Macromolecules. 1995; 28: 8759-8770Crossref Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). The probability of unfolding is p = j·α(F)·Δt, where j is the number of folded domains, α(F) = α0exp(F·Δxu/kBT) is the force-dependent unfolding rate constant, and Δt is the time step. A contour length increase of 28 nm was imposed for each unfolding event, and the persistence length of the polypeptide chain was set to 0.4 nm. Bootstrap sampling was used to determine uncertainty in the zero force unfolding rate for WT and T16I Ig10. 10,000 bootstrap samples were generated by resampling with replacement from our AFM data. Resampling was performed for each unfolding force peak (i.e. peak i values of a bootstrap data set were taken from peak i experimental forces), and an average parent cdf (with peak dependence removed) was generated for each bootstrap sample. This cdf was then compared with Monte Carlo simulation cdfs to determine the unfolding rate that best describes the bootstrap cdf. The S.D. of the 10,000 bootstrap unfolding rates is reported as the error in unfolding rate for WT and T16I Ig10. The distance to the transition barrier (Δxu) was fixed at 0.3 nm for bootstrap sampling. All data acquired from the AFM refolding protocol were analyzed together using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to determine the refolding rate of WT and T16I Ig10. Although we have evidence for two-step refolding, this process was observed too rarely to generate a data set large enough for analysis. Therefore, partial refolding was considered a 0.5 refolding event for MLE. Domain refolding was modeled as a Bernoulli trial with a success probability of 1 − e−β·t. The likelihood function we want to maximize is as follows, L(β∣x¯,t¯)=Π1−e−β⋅tixie−β⋅ti1−xi(Eq. 2) where β is the refolding rate, x and t are the measured observables, and the likelihood is the product of all possible refolding events. The vectors x and t are length N (number of domains able to refold), with xi = 1 if refolding occurs and 0 otherwise, and ti equal to the user-defined hold time. To determine uncertainty in estimated refolding rate, we generated 10,000 bootstrap samples from our experimental data. We then performed MLE on each of the new data sets (to obtain a best fit β′ for each bootstrap sample) and took the S.D. value of all 10,000 β′ to determine the error in our refolding rate estimate for our experimental data set. Purified trypsin from bovine pancreas was purchased from Sigma. Freshly dissolved trypsin (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6) was incubated with Ig10 5-mer at 37 °C until the reaction was stopped with reducing buffer. Proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-stained. Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher) with an Advion Nanomate (Ithaca, NY) source operated in data-dependent MS/MS mode was used for determining N-terminal peptides of protein degradation products. High resolution mass measurement of peptides was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). The MALDI experiments were performed on a Bruker Ultraflex III MALDI TOF-TOF instrument using sinapinic acid as the matrix. Physiological protease degradation assays were performed on Ig7–13 fragments (with or without T16I mutation in Ig10). Fresh mouse hearts were blended in 800 μl of 1× PBS (either pH 5 or 8) + 1.5 mm CaCl2. The resulting pH of the heart extract was ∼6.3 and ∼7.4, as determined by a micro-pH electrode (Lazar Research Laboratories, Los Angeles, CA). The heart extract was then added to WT and mutant Ig7–13. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and a portion of the mixture was removed at various time points and spun down at 13,000 rpm for 2 min. The resulting supernatants were then solubilized and separated using SDS-PAGE. Titin-based passive tension (in mN/mm2) as a function of sarcomere length (SL) was determined from muscle mechanics data (32.Nedrud J. Labeit S. Gotthardt M. Granzier H.

https://openalex.org/W2056664700,"NOD1 and NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins) are intracellular pattern recognition receptors that activate inflammation and autophagy. These pathways rely on the caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) within the receptors, which serve as protein interaction platforms that coordinately regulate immune signaling. We show that NOD1 CARD binds ubiquitin (Ub), in addition to directly binding its downstream targets receptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (RIP2) and autophagy-related protein 16-1 (ATG16L1). NMR spectroscopy and structure-guided mutagenesis identified a small hydrophobic surface of NOD1 CARD that binds Ub. In vitro, Ub competes with RIP2 for association with NOD1 CARD. In vivo, we found that the ligand-stimulated activity of NOD1 with a mutant CARD lacking Ub binding but retaining ATG16L1 and RIP2 binding is increased relative to wild-type NOD1. Likewise, point mutations in the tandem NOD2 CARDs at positions analogous to the surface residues defining the Ub interface on NOD1 resulted in loss of Ub binding and increased ligand-stimulated NOD2 signaling. These data suggest that Ub binding provides a negative feedback loop upon NOD-dependent activation of RIP2."
https://openalex.org/W2106710825,"Intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) dramatically increases bone mass and currently is one of the most effective treatments for osteoporosis. However, the detailed mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that conditioned media from PTH-treated osteoblastic and osteocytic cells contain soluble chemotactic factors for bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors, which express a low amount of PTH receptor (PTH1R) and do not respond to PTH stimulation by increasing cAMP production or migrating toward PTH alone. Conditioned media from PTH-treated osteoblasts elevated phosphorylated Akt and p38MAPK amounts in mesenchymal progenitors and inhibition of these pathways blocked the migration of these progenitors toward conditioned media. Our previous and current studies revealed that PTH stimulates the expression of amphiregulin, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like ligand that signals through the EGF receptor (EGFR), in both osteoblasts and osteocytes. Interestingly, conditioned media from PTH-treated osteoblasts increased EGFR phosphorylation in mesenchymal progenitors. Using several different approaches, including inhibitor, neutralizing antibody, and siRNA, we demonstrate that PTH increases the release of amphiregulin from osteoblastic cells, which acts on the EGFRs expressed on mesenchymal progenitors to stimulate the Akt and p38MAPK pathways and subsequently promote their migration in vitro. Furthermore, inactivation of EGFR signaling specifically in osteoprogenitors/osteoblasts attenuated the anabolic actions of PTH on bone formation. Taken together, these results suggest a novel mechanism for the therapeutic effect of PTH on osteoporosis and an important role of EGFR signaling in mediating PTH's anabolic actions on bone."
https://openalex.org/W2109628305,"Retinoic acid receptor β 2 (RARβ2) is a tumor suppressor gene whose loss of expression is recurrent in prostate cancers. Here we studied the epigenetic mechanisms leading to its stable silencing. First, we characterized all RARβ isoforms in 6 human tumor cell lines (prostate DU145, LNCaP, PC3, lung A549, breast Hs578T, and colon HCT116) by RT-PCR and Western blot. We excluded loss of heterozygosity (2D-FISH) and loss of RARa expression, an upstream regulator, as origin of RARβ2 silencing. All data concluded to an epigenetic silencing. In agreement, a DNA methylation inhibitor restored its expression. Second RARβ2 loss of expression was found associated with different epigenetic profiles in LNCaP and DU145 cells. According to bisulfite sequencing and ChIP analysis, we observed heavy methylation (97%) of the RARβ2 promoter with repressive histone mark H3K9me3 in LNCaP. While DNA methylation and polycomb repression are described to be mutually exclusive at CpG-rich promoters, we observed that in DU145, moderate DNA methylation (36%) and H3K9me3 mark were present concomitantly with H3K27me3, a signature of polycomb repression. In summary, we provide new insights on how the RARβ2 promoter is silenced, reveal the existence of two distinct repressive chromatin profiles at the same locus, and support a polycomb-mediated epigenetic repression process in prostate cancer.—Moison, C., Senamaud-Beaufort, C., Fourrière, L., Champion, C., Ceccaldi, A., Lacomme, S., Daunay, A., Tost, J.

https://openalex.org/W2091680105,"Glucokinase is the predominant hexokinase expressed in hepatocytes and pancreatic β-cells, with a pivotal role in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, illustrated by glucokinase gene mutations causing monogenic diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. A complex tissue-specific network of mechanisms regulates this enzyme, and a major unanswered question in glucokinase biology is how post-translational modifications control the function of the enzyme. Here, we show that the pancreatic isoform of human glucokinase is SUMOylated in vitro, using recombinant enzymes, and in insulin-secreting model cells. Three N-terminal lysines unique for the pancreatic isoform (Lys-12/Lys-13 and/or Lys-15) may represent one SUMOylation site, with an additional site (Lys-346) common for the pancreatic and the liver isoform. SUMO-1 and E2 overexpression stabilized preferentially the wild-type human pancreatic enzyme in MIN6 β-cells, and SUMOylation increased the catalytic activity of recombinant human glucokinase in vitro and also of glucokinase in target cells.

https://openalex.org/W2005481656,"Recent progress in stem cell biology, notably cell fate conversion, calls for novel theoretical understanding for cell differentiation. The existing qualitative concept of Waddington’s “epigenetic landscape” has attracted particular attention because it captures subsequent fate decision points, thus manifesting the hierarchical (“tree-like”) nature of cell fate diversification. Here, we generalized a recent work and explored such a developmental landscape for a two-gene fate decision circuit by integrating the underlying probability landscapes with different parameters (corresponding to distinct developmental stages). The change of entropy production rate along the parameter changes indicates which parameter changes can represent a normal developmental process while other parameters’ change can not. The transdifferentiation paths over the landscape under certain conditions reveal the possibility of a direct and reversible phenotypic conversion. As the intensity of noise increases, we found that the landscape becomes flatter and the dominant paths more straight, implying the importance of biological noise processing mechanism in development and reprogramming. We further extended the landscape of the one-step fate decision to that for two-step decisions in central nervous system (CNS) differentiation. A minimal network and dynamic model for CNS differentiation was firstly constructed where two three-gene motifs are coupled. We then implemented the SDEs (Stochastic Differentiation Equations) simulation for the validity of the network and model. By integrating the two landscapes for the two switch gene pairs, we constructed the two-step development landscape for CNS differentiation. Our work provides new insights into cellular differentiation and important clues for better reprogramming strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2037214280,"This investigation was to elucidate the basis for augmentation of nitric-oxide synthesis in neutrophils exposed to hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperoxia increases synthesis of reactive species leading to S-nitrosylation of β-actin, which causes temporary inhibition of β2 integrin adherence. Impaired β2 integrin function and actin S-nitrosylation do not occur in neutrophils from mice lacking type-2 nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) or when incubated with 1400W, an iNOS inhibitor. Similarly, effects of hyperoxia were abrogated in cells depleted of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by treatment with small inhibitory RNA and those exposed to a specific FAK inhibitor concurrent with hyperoxia. Nitric oxide production doubles within 10 min exposure to hyperoxia but declines to approximately half-maximum production over an additional 10 min. Elevated nitric oxide production did not occur after FAK depletion or inhibition, or when filamentous actin formation was inhibited by cytochalasin D. Intracellular content of iNOS triples over the course of a 45-min exposure to hyperoxia and iNOS dimers increase in a commensurate fashion. Confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that co-localization/linkage of FAK, iNOS, and filamentous actin increased within 15 min exposure to hyperoxia but then decreased below the control level. Using isolated enzymes in ex vivo preparations an association between iNOS and filamentous actin mediated by FAK could be demonstrated and complex formation was impeded when actin was S-nitrosylated. We conclude that iNOS activity is increased by an FAK-mediated association with actin filaments but peak nitric oxide production is transient due to actin S-nitrosylation during exposure to hyperoxia.Background: Reactive nitrogen species increase by an unclear mechanism with exposure to hyperbaric oxygen, which inhibits neutrophil β2 integrin adherence.Results: Nitric-oxide synthase-2 activity increases when held in proximity to short filamentous actin by focal adhesion kinase.Conclusion: Protein associations are transient because of actin S-nitrosylation.Significance: Nitric-oxide synthase regulation in neutrophils depends on cytoskeletal protein associations. This investigation was to elucidate the basis for augmentation of nitric-oxide synthesis in neutrophils exposed to hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperoxia increases synthesis of reactive species leading to S-nitrosylation of β-actin, which causes temporary inhibition of β2 integrin adherence. Impaired β2 integrin function and actin S-nitrosylation do not occur in neutrophils from mice lacking type-2 nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) or when incubated with 1400W, an iNOS inhibitor. Similarly, effects of hyperoxia were abrogated in cells depleted of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by treatment with small inhibitory RNA and those exposed to a specific FAK inhibitor concurrent with hyperoxia. Nitric oxide production doubles within 10 min exposure to hyperoxia but declines to approximately half-maximum production over an additional 10 min. Elevated nitric oxide production did not occur after FAK depletion or inhibition, or when filamentous actin formation was inhibited by cytochalasin D. Intracellular content of iNOS triples over the course of a 45-min exposure to hyperoxia and iNOS dimers increase in a commensurate fashion. Confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that co-localization/linkage of FAK, iNOS, and filamentous actin increased within 15 min exposure to hyperoxia but then decreased below the control level. Using isolated enzymes in ex vivo preparations an association between iNOS and filamentous actin mediated by FAK could be demonstrated and complex formation was impeded when actin was S-nitrosylated. We conclude that iNOS activity is increased by an FAK-mediated association with actin filaments but peak nitric oxide production is transient due to actin S-nitrosylation during exposure to hyperoxia. Background: Reactive nitrogen species increase by an unclear mechanism with exposure to hyperbaric oxygen, which inhibits neutrophil β2 integrin adherence.

https://openalex.org/W2067240669,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans regulate various physiological and developmental processes through interactions with a number of protein ligands. Heparan sulfate (HS)-ligand binding depends on the amount and patterns of sulfate groups on HS, which are controlled by various HS sulfotransferases in the Golgi apparatus as well as extracellular 6-O-endosulfatases called ""Sulfs."" Sulfs are a family of secreted molecules that specifically remove 6-O-sulfate groups within the highly sulfated regions on HS. Vertebrate Sulfs promote Wnt signaling, whereas the only Drosophila homologue of Sulfs, Sulf1, negatively regulates Wingless (Wg) signaling. To understand the molecular mechanism for the negative regulation of Wg signaling by Sulf1, we studied the effects of Sulf1 on HS-Wg interaction and Wg stability. Sulf1 overexpression strongly inhibited the binding of Wg to Dally, a potential target heparan sulfate proteoglycan of Sulf1. This effect of Drosophila Sulf1 on the HS-Wg interaction is similar to that of vertebrate Sulfs. Using in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo systems, we show that Sulf1 reduces extracellular Wg protein levels, at least partly by facilitating Wg degradation. In addition, expression of human Sulf1 in the Drosophila wing disc lowers the levels of extracellular Wg protein, as observed for Drosophila Sulf1. Our study demonstrates that vertebrate and Drosophila Sulfs have an intrinsically similar activity and that the function of Sulfs in the fate of Wnt/Wg ligands is context-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2073176414,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are trimeric cation-selective proton-gated ion channels expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The pore-forming transmembrane helices in these channels are linked by short loops to the palm domain in the extracellular region. Here, we explore the contribution to proton gating and desensitization of Glu-79 and Glu-416 in the palm domain of ASIC1a. Engineered Cys, Lys, and Gln substitutions at these positions shifted apparent proton affinity toward more acidic values. Double mutant cycle analysis indicated that Glu-79 and Glu-416 cooperatively facilitated pore opening in response to extracellular acidification. Channels bearing Cys at position 79 or 416 were irreversibly modified by thiol-reactive reagents in a state-dependent manner. Glu-79 and Glu-416 are located in β-strands 1 and 12, respectively. The covalent modification by (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl) methanethiosulfonate bromide of Cys at position 79 impacted conformational changes associated with pore closing during desensitization, whereas the modification of Cys at position 416 affected conformational changes associated with proton gating. These results suggest that β-strands 1 and 12 contribute antagonistically to activation and desensitization of ASIC1a. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that the lower palm domain contracts in response to extracellular acidification. Taken together, our studies suggest that the lower palm domain mediates conformational movements that drive pore opening and closing events."
https://openalex.org/W2014989420,"Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) and its paralogs, HDAC5, -7, and -9 (all members of class IIa), possess multiple phosphorylation sites crucial for 14-3-3 binding and subsequent nuclear export. cAMP signaling stimulates nuclear import of HDAC4 and HDAC5, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here we show that cAMP potentiates nuclear localization of HDAC9. Mutation of an SP motif conserved in HDAC4, -5, and -9 prevents cAMP-stimulated nuclear localization. Unexpectedly, this treatment inhibits phosphorylation at the SP motif, indicating an inverse relationship between the phosphorylation event and nuclear import. Consistent with this, leptomycin B-induced nuclear import and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment result in the dephosphorylation at the motif. Moreover, the modification synergizes with phosphorylation at a nearby site, and similar kinetics was observed for both phosphorylation events during myoblast and adipocyte differentiation. These results thus unravel a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby cAMP promotes dephosphorylation and differentially regulates multisite phosphorylation and the nuclear localization of class IIa HDACs."
https://openalex.org/W2015104782,"Differences in genomic structure between individuals are ubiquitous features of human genetic variation. Specific copy number variants (CNVs) have been associated with susceptibility to numerous complex psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism-spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. These disorders often display co-morbidity with low intelligence. Rare chromosomal deletions and duplications are associated with these disorders, so it has been suggested that these deletions or duplications may be associated with differences in intelligence. Here we investigate associations between large (≥500kb), rare (<1% population frequency) CNVs and both fluid and crystallized intelligence in community-dwelling older people. We observe no significant associations between intelligence and total CNV load. Examining individual CNV regions previously implicated in neuropsychological disorders, we find suggestive evidence that CNV regions around SHANK3 are associated with fluid intelligence as derived from a battery of cognitive tests. This is the first study to examine the effects of rare CNVs as called by multiple algorithms on cognition in a large non-clinical sample, and finds no effects of such variants on general cognitive ability."

https://openalex.org/W2025549951,"To examine the impacts of a multi-city HIV prevention public health program (China Global Fund Round 5 Project) on condom use and HIV infection, we analyzed four yearly cross-sectional surveys from 2006 through 2009 among 20,843 men who have sex with men (MSM) in 16 Chinese cities. Self-reported condom use at last sex with a male partner increased from 58% in 2006 to 81% in 2009 (trend test, P<0.001). HIV prevalence increased from 2.3% in 2006 to 5.3% in 2009 (P<0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that self-reported receipt of interventions was an independent predictor of increased condom use at last sex with a male partner over time (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.63 in 2006 to 2.33 in 2009; P<0.001), and lower HIV prevalence (aOR, 1.08 in 2006 to 0.45 in 2009; P<0.001). HIV prevalence increased from 2006–2009 for participants with no self-reported receipt of interventions (2.1% in 2006 to 10.3% in 2009) and less so for those with interventions (2.4% to 4.7%). This Chinese public health program had positive impacts on both behaviors and disease rate among MSM population. Escalation of the coverage and intensity of effective interventions is needed for further increasing condom use and for reversing the rising trend of HIV epidemic."

To support the high energy requirements of muscle contraction, myogenesis entails an increase in mitochondrial (mt) mass with stimulation of mtDNA synthesis and consumption of DNA precursors (dNTPs). Myotubes are quiescent cells and as such down-regulate dNTP production despite a high demand for dNTPs. Although myogenesis has been studied extensively, changes in dNTP metabolism have not been examined specifically. In differentiating cultures of C2C12 myoblasts and purified myotubes, we analyzed expression and activities of enzymes of dNTP biosynthesis, dNTP pools, and the expansion of mtDNA. Myotubes exibited pronounced post-mitotic modifications of dNTP synthesis with a particularly marked down-regulation of de novo thymidylate synthesis. Expression profiling revealed the same pattern of enzyme down-regulation in adult murine muscles. The mtDNA increased steadily after myoblast fusion, turning over rapidly, as revealed after treatment with ethidium bromide. We individually down-regulated p53R2 ribonucleotide reductase, thymidine kinase 2, and deoxyguanosine kinase by siRNA transfection to examine how a further reduction of these synthetic enzymes impacted myotube development. Silencing of p53R2 had little effect, but silencing of either mt kinase caused 50% mtDNA depletion and an unexpected decrease of all four dNTP pools independently of the kinase specificity. We suggest that during development of myotubes the shortage of even a single dNTP may affect all four pools through dysregulation of ribonucleotide reduction and/or dissipation of the non-limiting dNTPs during unproductive elongation of new DNA chains.

https://openalex.org/W2002881121,"Pacific herring show an abrupt genetic discontinuity in the central North Pacific that represents secondary contact between refuge populations previously isolated during Pleistocene glaciations. Paradoxically, high levels of gene flow produce genetic homogeneity among ocean-type populations within each group. Here, we surveyed variability in mtDNA control-region sequences (463 bp) and nine microsatellite loci in Pacific herring from sites across the North Pacific to further explore the nature of the genetic discontinuity around the Alaska Peninsula. Consistent with previous studies, little divergence (ΦST = 0.011) was detected between ocean-type populations of Pacific herring in the North West Pacific, except for a population in the Yellow Sea (ΦST = 0.065). A moderate reduction in genetic diversity for both mtDNA and microsatellites in the Yellow Sea likely reflects founder effects during the last colonization of this sea. Reciprocal monophyly between divergent mtDNA lineages (ΦST = 0.391) across the Alaska Peninsula defines the discontinuity across the North Pacific. However, microsatellites did not show a strong break, as eastern Bering Sea (EBS) herring were more closely related to NE Pacific than to NW Pacific herring. This discordance between mtDNA and microsatellites may be due to microsatellite allelic convergence or to sex-biased dispersal across the secondary contact zone. The sharp discontinuity between Pacific herring populations may be maintained by high-density blocking, competitive exclusion or hybrid inferiority."
https://openalex.org/W2011626672,"Steeply voltage-dependent inward rectification of Kir (inwardly rectifying potassium) channels arises from blockade by cytoplasmic polyamines. These polycationic blockers traverse a long (>70 Å) pore, displacing multiple permeant ions, en route to a high affinity binding site that remains loosely defined. We have scanned the effects of cysteine modification at multiple pore-lining positions on the blocking properties of a library of polyamine analogs, demonstrating that the effects of cysteine modification are position- and blocker-dependent. Specifically, introduction of positively charged adducts results in two distinct phenotypes: either disruption of blocker binding or generation of a barrier to blocker migration, in a consistent pattern that depends on both the length of the polyamine blocker and the position of the modified cysteine. These findings reveal important details about the chemical basis and specific location of high affinity polyamine binding."
https://openalex.org/W2151652273,"Recently available G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) structures and biophysical studies suggest that the difference between the effects of various agonists and antagonists cannot be explained by single structures alone, but rather that the conformational ensembles of the proteins need to be considered. Here we use an elastic network model-guided molecular dynamics simulation protocol to generate an ensemble of conformers of a prototypical GPCR, β(2)-adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR). The resulting conformers are clustered into groups based on the conformations of the ligand binding site, and distinct conformers from each group are assessed for their binding to known agonists of β(2)AR. We show that the select ligands bind preferentially to different predicted conformers of β(2)AR, and identify a role of β(2)AR extracellular region as an allosteric binding site for larger drugs such as salmeterol. Thus, drugs and ligands can be used as ""computational probes"" to systematically identify protein conformers with likely biological significance."
https://openalex.org/W1989876414,"Background Although autoimmunity in MRL/lpr mice occurs due to a defect in Fas-mediated cell death of T cells, the role of Fas-independent apoptosis in pathogenesis has rarely been investigated. We have recently reported that receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL)-activated dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in MRL/lpr mice. We here attempted to establish a new therapeutic strategy with RANKL-activated DCs in RA by controlling apoptosis of peripheral T cells. Repeated transfer of RANKL-activated DCs into MRL/lpr mice was tested to determine whether this had a therapeutic effect on autoimmunity. Methods and Finding Cellular and molecular mechanisms of Fas-independent apoptosis of T cells induced by the DCs were investigated by in vitro and in vivo analyses. We demonstrated that repeated transfers of RANKL-activated DCs into MRL/lpr mice resulted in therapeutic effects on RA lesions and lymphoproliferation due to declines of CD4+ T, B, and CD4−CD8− double negative (DN) T cells. We also found that the Fas-independent T-cell apoptosis was induced by a direct interaction between tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) on T cells and TRAIL on Fas-deficient DCs in MRL/lpr mice. Conclusion These results strongly suggest that a novel Fas-independent apoptosis pathway in T cells maintains peripheral tolerance and thus controls autoimmunity in MRL/lpr mice."
https://openalex.org/W2026090746,"Introduction In January 2010, the Virginia Department of Health received reports of 2 hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections (1 acute, 1 chronic) among residents of a single assisted living facility (ALF). Both infected residents had diabetes and received assisted monitoring of blood glucose (AMBG) at the facility. An investigation was initiated in response. Objective To determine the extent and mechanism of HBV transmission among ALF residents. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting An ALF that primarily housed residents with neuropsychiatric disorders in 2 adjacent buildings in Virginia. Participants Residents of the facility as of March 2010. Measurements HBV serologic testing, relevant medical history, and HBV genome sequences. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to identify risk factors for HBV infection. Results HBV serologic status was determined for 126 (91%) of 139 residents. Among 88 susceptible residents, 14 became acutely infected (attack rate, 16%), and 74 remained uninfected. Acute HBV infection developed among 12 (92%) of 13 residents who received AMBG, compared with 2 (3%) of 75 residents who did not (RR = 35; 95% CI, 8.7, 137). Identified infection control breaches during AMBG included shared use of fingerstick devices for multiple residents. HBV genome sequencing demonstrated 2 building-specific phylogenetic infection clusters, each having 99.8–100% sequence identity. Limitations Transfer of residents out of the facility prior to our investigation might have contributed to an underestimate of cases. Resident interviews provided insufficient information to fully assess behavioral risk factors for HBV infection. Conclusions Failure to adhere to safe practices during AMBG resulted in a large HBV outbreak. Protection of a growing and vulnerable ALF population requires improved training of staff and routine facility licensing inspections that scrutinize infection control practices."
https://openalex.org/W2092867234,"Bacterial chromosomal toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been proposed not only to play an important role in the stress response, but also to be associated with antibiotic resistance. Here, we identified the chromosomal HP0892-HP0893 TA proteins in the gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, and structurally characterized their protein-protein interaction. Previously, HP0892 protein was suggested to be a putative TA toxin based on its structural similarity to other RelE family TA toxins. In this study, we demonstrated that HP0892 binds to HP0893 strongly with a stoichiometry of 1:1, and HP0892-HP0893 interaction occurs mainly between the N-terminal secondary structure elements of HP0892 and the C-terminal region of HP0893. HP0892 cleaved mRNA in vitro, preferentially at the 5' end of A or G, and the RNase activity of HP0892 was inhibited by HP0893. In addition, heterologous expression of HP0892 in Escherichia coli cells led to cell growth arrest, and the cell toxicity of HP0892 was neutralized by co-expression with HP0893. From these results and a structural comparison with other TA toxins, it is concluded that HP0892 is a toxin with intrinsic RNase activity and HP0893 is an antitoxin against HP0892 from a TA system of H. pylori. It has been known that hp0893 gene and another TA antitoxin gene, hp0895, of H. pylori, are both genomic open reading frames that correspond to genes that are potentially expressed in response to interactions with the human gastric mucosa. Therefore, it is highly probable that TA systems of H. pylori are involved in virulence of H. pylori."
https://openalex.org/W2021512697,"Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM) binds integrin α4β7. Their interaction directs lymphocyte homing to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues. The interaction between the two immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains of MAdCAM and integrin α4β7 is unusual in its ability to mediate either rolling adhesion or firm adhesion of lymphocytes on vascular surfaces. We determined four crystal structures of the IgSF domains of MAdCAM to test for unusual structural features that might correlate with this functional diversity. Higher resolution 1.7- and 1.4-Å structures of the IgSF domains of MAdCAM in a previously described crystal lattice revealed two alternative conformations of the integrin-binding loop, which were deformed by large lattice contacts. New crystal forms in the presence of two different Fabs to MAdCAM demonstrate a shift in IgSF domain topology from the I2- to I1-set, with a switch of integrin-binding loop from CC' to CD. The I1-set fold and CD loop appear biologically relevant. The different conformations seen in crystal structures suggest that the integrin-binding loop of MAdCAM is inherently flexible. This contrasts with rigidity of the corresponding loops in vascular cell adhesion molecule, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3, and ICAM-5 and may reflect a specialization of MAdCAM to mediate both rolling and firm adhesion by binding to different α4β7 integrin conformations."

We have developed a compact high-sensitivity PET system that consisted of two large-area panel PET detector heads, which produce more than 224 million lines of response and thus request dramatic computational demands. In this work, we employed a state-of-the-art graphics processing unit (GPU), NVIDIA Tesla C2070, to yield an efficient reconstruction process. Our approaches ingeniously integrate the distinguished features of the symmetry properties of the imaging system and GPU architectures, including block/warp/thread assignments and effective memory usage, to accelerate the computations for ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) image reconstruction. The OSEM reconstruction algorithms were implemented employing both CPU-based and GPU-based codes, and their computational performance was quantitatively analyzed and compared. The results showed that the GPU-accelerated scheme can drastically reduce the reconstruction time and thus can largely expand the applicability of the dual-head PET system."
https://openalex.org/W2009736698,"Type 1 phosphotidylinosotol-4 phosphate 5 kinase γ (PIP5KIγ) is central to generation of phosphotidylinosotol (4,5)P(2) (PI(4,5)P(2)). PIP5KIγ also participates in cytoskeletal organization by delivering talin to integrins, thereby enhancing their ligand binding capacity. As the cytoskeleton is pivotal to osteoclast function, we hypothesized that absence of PIP5KIγ would compromise their resorptive capacity. Absence of the kinase diminishes PI(4,5) abundance and desensitizes precursors to RANK ligand-stimulated differentiation. Thus, PIP5KIγ(-/-) osteoclasts are reduced in number in vitro and confirm physiological relevance in vivo. Despite reduced numbers, PIP5KIγ(-/-) osteoclasts surprisingly have normal cytoskeletons and effectively resorb bone. PIP5KIγ overexpression, which increases PI(4,5)P(2), also delays osteoclast differentiation and reduces cell number but in contrast to cells lacking the kinase, its excess disrupts the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton-disruptive effects of excess PIP5KIγ reflect its kinase activity and are independent of talin recognition. The combined arrested differentiation and disorganized cytoskeleton of PIP5KIγ-transduced osteoclasts compromises bone resorption. Thus, optimal PIP5KIγ and PI(4,5)P(2) expression, by osteoclasts, are essential for skeletal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1970971929,"The onset of parturition is associated with a number of proinflammatory mediators that are themselves regulated by the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors. In this context, we previously reported that the RelA NF-κB subunit represses transcription and mRNA expression of the proquiescent Gαs gene in human myometrial cells following stimulation with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. In the present study, we initially defined the functional consequence of this on myometrial contractility. Here we show that, contrary to our initial expectations, TNF did not induce myometrial contractility but did inhibit the relaxation produced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, an effect that in turn was abolished by the NF-κB inhibitor N(4)-[2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethyl]-4,6-quinazolinediamine. This result suggested a role for TNF in regulating Gαs expression via activating NF-κB and modifying histone acetylation associated with the promoter region of the gene. In this context, we show that the -837 to -618 region of the endogenous Gαs promoter is occupied by cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), Egr-1, and Sp1 transcription factors and that CREB-binding protein (CBP) transcriptional complexes form within this region where they induce histone acetylation, resulting in increased Gαs expression. TNF, acting via NF-κB, did not change the levels of CREB, Sp1, or Egr-1 binding to the Gαs promoter, but it induced a significant reduction in the level of CBP. This was associated with increased levels of histone deacetylase-1 and surprisingly an increase in H4K8 acetylation. The latter is discussed herein."
