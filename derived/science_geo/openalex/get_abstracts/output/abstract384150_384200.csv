https://openalex.org/W2030984826,"Background The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis has been shown to increase host resistance to viral infection in native Drosophila hosts and in the normally Wolbachia-free heterologous host Aedes aegypti when infected by Wolbachia from Drosophila melanogaster or Aedes albopictus. Wolbachia infection has not yet been demonstrated to increase viral resistance in a native Wolbachia-mosquito host system. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated Wolbachia-induced resistance to West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae) by measuring infection susceptibility in Wolbachia-infected and Wolbachia-free D. melanogaster and Culex quinquefasciatus, a natural mosquito vector of WNV. Wolbachia infection of D. melanogaster induces strong resistance to WNV infection. Wolbachia-infected flies had a 500-fold higher ID50 for WNV and produced 100,000-fold lower virus titers compared to flies lacking Wolbachia. The resistance phenotype was transmitted as a maternal, cytoplasmic factor and was fully reverted in flies cured of Wolbachia. Wolbachia infection had much less effect on the susceptibility of D. melanogaster to Chikungunya (Togaviridae) and La Crosse (Bunyaviridae) viruses. Wolbachia also induces resistance to WNV infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus. While Wolbachia had no effect on the overall rate of peroral infection by WNV, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes produced lower virus titers and had 2 to 3-fold lower rates of virus transmission compared to mosquitoes lacking Wolbachia. Conclusions/Significance This is the first demonstration that Wolbachia can increase resistance to arbovirus infection resulting in decreased virus transmission in a native Wolbachia-mosquito system. The results suggest that Wolbachia reduces vector competence in Cx. quinquefasciatus, and potentially in other Wolbachia-infected mosquito vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2014522512,"Terminal differentiation of NK cells is crucial in maintaining broad responsiveness to pathogens and discriminating normal cells from cells in distress. Although it is well established that KIRs, in conjunction with NKG2A, play a major role in the NK cell education that determines whether cells will end up competent or hyporesponsive, the events underlying the differentiation are still debated.A combination of complementary approaches to assess the kinetics of the appearance of each subset during development allowed us to obtain new insights into these terminal stages of differentiation, characterising their gene expression profiles at a pan-genomic level, their distinct surface receptor patterns and their prototypic effector functions. The present study supports the hypothesis that CD56dim cells derive from the CD56bright subset and suggests that NK cell responsiveness is determined by persistent inhibitory signals received during their education. We report here the inverse correlation of NKG2A expression with KIR expression and explore whether this correlation bestows functional competence on NK cells. We show that CD56dimNKG2A-KIR+ cells display the most differentiated phenotype associated to their unique ability to respond against HLA-E+ target cells. Importantly, after IL-12+IL-18 stimulation, reacquisition of NKG2A strongly correlates with IFN-gamma production in CD56dimNKG2A- NK cells.Together, these findings call for the reclassification of mature human NK cells into distinct subsets and support a new model, in which the NK cell differentiation and functional fate are based on a stepwise decrease of NKG2A and acquisition of KIRs."
https://openalex.org/W2146686951,"In recent decades, large pelagic and coastal shark populations have declined dramatically with increased fishing; however, the status of sharks in other systems such as coral reefs remains largely unassessed despite a long history of exploitation. Here we explore the contemporary distribution and sighting frequency of sharks on reefs in the greater-Caribbean and assess the possible role of human pressures on observed patterns.We analyzed 76,340 underwater surveys carried out by trained volunteer divers between 1993 and 2008. Surveys were grouped within one km2 cells, which allowed us to determine the contemporary geographical distribution and sighting frequency of sharks. Sighting frequency was calculated as the ratio of surveys with sharks to the total number of surveys in each cell. We compared sighting frequency to the number of people in the cell vicinity and used population viability analyses to assess the effects of exploitation on population trends. Sharks, with the exception of nurse sharks occurred mainly in areas with very low human population or strong fishing regulations and marine conservation. Population viability analysis suggests that exploitation alone could explain the large-scale absence; however, this pattern is likely to be exacerbated by additional anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution and habitat degradation, that also correlate with human population.Human pressures in coastal zones have lead to the broad-scale absence of sharks on reefs in the greater-Caribbean. Preventing further loss of sharks requires urgent management measures to curb fishing mortality and to mitigate other anthropogenic stressors to protect sites where sharks still exist. The fact that sharks still occur in some densely populated areas where strong fishing regulations are in place indicates the possibility of success and encourages the implementation of conservation measures."
https://openalex.org/W2010011361,"There is increasing recognition of the importance of B lymphocytes in the immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), encouraging the evaluation of B cell-associated biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We aimed to evaluate the relevance of the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 as a prognostic marker in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) regarding conversion to MS, and to compare it to Barkhof criteria in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), oligoclonal bands (OCB) and the polyspecific intrathecal B cell response against measles, rubella and varicella zoster virus (MRZR).CXCL13 was determined in a prospective study over 2 years including 46 patients that remained CIS over follow-up (CIS-CIS), 45 patients that developed MS (CIS-RRMS), and 30 controls using ELISA. CSF CXCL13 was significantly elevated in CIS-RRMS as compared to CIS-CIS and controls (p<0.001). It was significantly elevated in CIS with OCB (p<0.001), positive MRZR (p=0.04), and gadolinium enhancement in MRI (p=0.02) and showed a significant correlation with CSF leukocyte count (p<0.001) and QIgG (p<0.001). CXCL13 showed the best positive predictive value (PPV) of all parameters investigated (70%, 95%-CI: 53-84%), which could be further increased by combination with Barkhof criteria in MRI (80%).Our data indicate the relevance of CXCL13 in CIS to predict conversion to MS. It furthermore shows CXCL13 to be an important mediator in the inflammatory cascade associated with the polyspecific intrathecal B cell response that manifests itself in OCB and MRZR."
https://openalex.org/W2024427829,"Copper is an essential trace element that functions in a diverse array of biochemical processes that include mitochondrial respiration, neurotransmitter biogenesis, connective tissue maturation, and reactive oxygen chemistry. The Ctr1 protein is a high-affinity Cu<sup>+</sup> importer that is structurally and functionally conserved in yeast, plants, fruit flies, and humans and that, in all of these organisms, is localized to the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles. Although intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of Ctr1 in mice demonstrated a critical role for Ctr1 in dietary copper absorption, some controversy exists over the localization of Ctr1 in intestinal epithelial cells <i>in vivo</i>. In this work, we assess the localization of Ctr1 in intestinal epithelial cells through two independent mechanisms. Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that Ctr1 localizes to the apical membrane in intestinal epithelial cells of the mouse, rat, and pig. Moreover, biotinylation of intestinal luminal proteins from mice fed a control or a copper-deficient diet showed elevated levels of both total and apical membrane Ctr1 protein in response to transient dietary copper limitation. Experiments in cultured HEK293T cells demonstrated that alterations in the levels of the glycosylated form of Ctr1 in response to copper availability were a time-dependent, copper-specific posttranslational response. Taken together, these results demonstrate apical localization of Ctr1 in intestinal epithelia across three mammalian species and suggest that increased Ctr1 apical localization in response to dietary copper limitation may represent an adaptive response to homeostatically modulate Ctr1 availability at the site of intestinal copper absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2154970420,"Type I interferons (IFNs) are known to be critical factors in the activation of host antiviral responses and are also important in protection from influenza A virus infection. Especially, the RIG-I- and IPS-1-mediated intracellular type I IFN-inducing pathway is essential in the activation of antiviral responses in cells infected by influenza A virus. Previously, it has been reported that influenza A virus NS1 is involved in the inhibition of this pathway. We show in this report that the influenza A virus utilizes another critical inhibitory mechanism in this pathway. In fact, the viral polymerase complex exhibited an inhibitory activity on IFNβ promoter activation mediated by RIG-I and IPS-1, and this activity was not competitive with the function of NS1. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that each polymerase subunit bound to IPS-1 in mammalian cells, and each subunit inhibited the activation of IFNβ promoter by IPS-1 independently. In addition, by a combinational expression of each polymerase subunit, IPS-1-induced activation of IFNβ promoter was more efficiently inhibited by the expression of PB2 or PB2-containing complex. Moreover, the expression of PB2 inhibited the transcription of the endogenous IFNβ gene induced after influenza A virus infection. These findings demonstrate that the viral polymerase plays an important role for regulating host anti-viral response through the binding to IPS-1 and inhibition of IFNβ production.

These findings demonstrate that the viral polymerase plays an important role for regulating host anti-viral response through the binding to IPS-1 and inhibition of IFNβ production. Influenza A virus, which belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae, is a negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus, which causes respiratory disease in humans. Influenza A virus carries eight segmented RNA as its genome, and viral proteins are translated from viral mRNA transcripted by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza A virus. The influenza A virus polymerase complex is a heterotrimer consisting of PA (polymerase acidic protein), PB1 (polymerase basic protein 1), and PB2, and each component is crucial in order for the virus to replicate (1Neumann G. Brownlee G.G. Fodor E. Kawaoka Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 283: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Type I interferons (IFNs) represented by IFNα and IFNβ are known to be important factors in the activation of host defensive mechanisms against invasion of exogenous pathogens. Type I IFNs are produced by various cells and activate transcription of IFN-stimulated genes through the IFNα receptor, JAK (Janus kinase), and STAT (signal transducers and activator of transcription) (2Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar, 3Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Production of proteins from IFN-stimulated genes is also important in the acquisition of resistance to influenza A virus infection. For instance, mouse Mx1 (myxovirus resistance 1) or its human homologue MxA, which is known to be a member of the IFN-stimulated genes, displays a strong antiviral activity against influenza A virus infection by overexpression (4Arnheiter H. Skuntz S. Noteborn M. Chang S. Meier E. Cell. 1990; 62: 51-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Garber E.A. Chute H.T. Condra J.H. Gotlib L. Colonno R.J. Smith R.G.

The induction pathway for Type I IFN is activated by cellular sensors, which recognize exogenous pathogens, such as Toll-like receptor family receptors (7Kirk P. Bazan J.F. Immunity. 2005; 23: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Kumar H. Kawai T. Akira S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 388: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Recently, the gene products of RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5) were identified as intracellular RNA sensors, which are responsible for the activation of IFN induction in cells infected with viruses (9Yoneyama M.

These molecules recognize distinct viruses in each other (e.g. RIG-I recognizes Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Reoviridae, whereas MDA5 recognizes Picornaviridae) (11Meylan E. Tschopp J. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 442: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 12Takeuchi O. Akira S. Curr. Opin.

IPS-1 is known to be a downstream mitochondrial adapter protein that transmits the induction signal of type I IFN through the activation of transcription factors IRF3 (IFN regulatory factor 3), IRF7, and NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) (14Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar, 15Xu L.G. Wang Y.Y. Han KJ. Li L.Y. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. Mol.

These molecules are assumed to be physiologically important in the inhibition of viral replication; in fact, the functions of these molecules are inhibited by a variety of viruses (18Foy E. Li K. Sumpter Jr., R. Loo Y.M. Johnson C.L. Wang C. Fish P.M. Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mechti N. Virology. 2009; 393: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from IPS-1-deficient mice do not completely produce type I IFN against influenza A virus infection (23Kumar H. Kawai T. Kato H. Sato S. Takahashi K. Coban C. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Therefore, the intracellular induction pathway for type I IFN is also thought to be important for the host defense against influenza A virus infection through the activation of an immunoresponse, especially at the early phase of infection. Previously, it has been reported that influenza A virus NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) binds to RIG-I and prevents IPS-1 mediated type I IFN production (24Pichlmair A. Schulz O. Tan C.P. Näslund T.I.

Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an earlier study using a UV-irradiated virus suggested that the influenza viral RNA polymerase is also responsible in the inhibition of type I IFN production (28Marcus P.I. Rojek J.M. Sekellick M.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2880-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A viral RNA polymerase recognizes cap structure at the 5′-end of host mRNA and snatches it as a primer for viral mRNA synthesis (29Hagen M. Chung T.D. Butcher J.A. Krystal M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1509-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Li M.L. Ramirez B.C. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5844-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because this function of a viral RNA polymerase causes shutoff of host protein synthesis by decreasing the mature mRNA level, the inhibitory activity of IFN production by the influenza A virus polymerase has been assumed to be dependent on this “cap-snatching” activity. However, there is no direct evidence to support this hypothesis. In this study, we report that the influenza A virus RNA polymerase performs the function of inhibition of the intracellular induction pathway for type I IFN by binding to IPS-1 independently of its cap-snatching activity. In addition, we show that this inhibitory function is mainly dependent on the PB2 subunit of a viral polymerase, and the expression of IFNβ mRNA induced after influenza A virus infection is inhibited by the expression of the PB2 protein. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfections were performed by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The specific antibodies used in this study, rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10, Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-IPS-1 polyclonal antibody (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), rabbit anti-IRF3 monoclonal antibody (D83B9; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and rabbit anti-phospho-IRF3 (Ser396) monoclonal antibody (4D4G; Cell signaling Technology) were purchased as commercially available products. The information for the specific antibodies raised against influenza A virus PA (clone 58/1), PB1 (clone 11/3), and PB2 (clone 143/3) is described elsewhere (31Hatta M. Asano Y. Masunaga K. Ito T.

Ishihama A. Kida H. Arch. Virol. 2000; 145: 1947-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To construct expression plasmids, the coding regions of PB2 from various strains were amplified from the infectious clones by PCR. A series of the expression vectors for FLAG-tagged deletion mutants of PB2 were constructed by PCR from PB2 cDNA derived from an influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8). PA, PB1, and NS1 coding regions were then obtained from the total RNA of PR8-infected cells by RT-PCR, and these amplified cDNAs were inserted into the cloning vectors to express epitope-tagged protein designated pcDNA5/FRT/FLAG, pcDNA5/FRT/HA, and pcDNA5/FRT/MYC, respectively. These cloning vectors were generated by an insertion of synthetic oligonucleotide, which encoded the peptide sequence for the epitope tag to pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen). The retrovirus vector carrying the PB2 gene was constructed by an insertion of the fragment encoding full-length PB2 derived from the expression plasmid into pMXs Puro (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA). The expression vectors for FLAG- and HA-tagged IPS-1, RIG-I, and MDA5 were described previously (16Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar), and p125 luc, which carries the firefly luciferase gene under the control of an INFβ promoter, is described elsewhere (33Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Sato M. Ozato K. Fujita T. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). pcDNA 3.1(+) TLR3 carried the full-length coding region of the human TLR3 (Toll-like receptor 3) gene was constructed by RT-PCR. To construct a template plasmid carrying influenza virus matrix (M) segment cDNA used for in vitro translation, the full-length M segment genome cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into a pCR blunt II TOPO cloning vector using a Zero blunt II TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). pBS HCV 1B IRES, which carries the hepatitis C virus type 1B 5′-untranslated region, was kindly provided by A. Nomoto (University of Tokyo). More detailed vector information is available upon request. Luciferase activities were quantified with a luminometer (Mtharas LB940; Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Single-stranded RNA used in this study to stimulate RIG-I was synthesized by in vitro transcription using a MEGAscript T7 kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) from the vector carrying the HCV 5′-UTR and influenza virus M segment cDNA downstream of the T7 promoter. These RNA were purified by using the MEGAclear kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Poly(I-C), the synthetic double-stranded RNA used to stimulate MDA5 and TLR3, was purchased from Sigma. IFNβ promoter activities were measured by firefly luciferase activity of the reporter plasmid carrying the human IFNβ promoter region, p125 luc, and activations of NF-κB were monitored by pNF-κB-luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which carries a synthetic promoter containing direct repeats of the NF-κB recognition sequence. The quantified results were normalized with the Renilla luciferase activities of the internal control vector (pGL 4.74; Promega). To analyze binding of transiently expressed proteins, the expression plasmids indicated in the figures were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the cells were then harvested and lysed by radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini; Roche Applied Science). After the cell debris was removed by centrifugation, the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). To analyze the binding of viral polymerase to the IPS-1 protein in virus-infected cells, the HEK293 cells were infected with the PR8 virus strain (multiplicity of infection = 2). After 8 h, the cells were harvested and were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PB2 monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The resins were washed five times with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer, and binding proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min with 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel-loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR for endogenously expressed IFNβ was carried out as described previously (34Opitz B. Vinzing M. van Laak V. Schmeck B. Heine G. Günther S. Preissner R. Slevogt H. N'Guessan P.D. Eitel J. Goldmann T. Flieger A. Suttorp N. Hippenstiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36173-36179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently, cDNA was synthesized from the RNA using random hexamer and reverse transcriptase (ReverTra Ace; Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Real-time PCRs were performed using SYBR Premix Ex TaqII (Takara, Otsu, Japan) and quantified by the Mx3000P quantitative PCR System (Stratagene). HEK293 cells were transfected with 2 μg of expression vector for intact PB2. After 35 h, the cells were infected with influenza virus A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2; Aichi) strain (multiplicity of infection = 2), and incubated with DMEM containing 1% BSA and 0.5 μg/ml trypsin for 3 h. Subsequently, the cells were harvested and subjected to RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. To investigate the function of the influenza virus polymerase complex against the induction of type I IFN, we constructed expression vectors that encode the N-terminal epitope-tagged influenza A virus RNA polymerase subunits PA, PB1, and PB2 derived from the H1N1 subtype influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8). Initially, we confirmed whether these N-terminal epitope-tagged subunits are able to form a heterotrimeric complex. The expression vectors for FLAG-tagged PB2 and HA-tagged PA and PB1 were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the whole cell extracts prepared from the cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG resin. As shown in Fig. 1, the results indicate that when three subunits are expressed together, both HA-tagged PA and PB1 subunits are co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged PB2 subunit. Previous reports demonstrated that the RNA polymerase subunits of influenza A virus are able to form PA/PB1 and PB1/PB2 heterodimers as intermediates, whereas PA/PB2 is not (35González S. Zürcher T. Ortín J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4456-4463Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Deng T. Sharps J. Fodor E. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8669-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In agreement with the previous observations, although the signal was relatively weak, HA-tagged PB1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged PB2, whereas HA-tagged PA was not. These results suggest that these N-terminal epitope-tagged subunits are able to form the heterotrimer of the mature viral polymerases. Next, we examined the effect of the expression of these subunits on the activation of the IFNβ promoter by stimulation with exogenous RNA by using a reporter gene assay. The results show that activation of IFNβ promoter mediated by MDA5 or RIG-I was significantly inhibited by the overexpression of the viral RNA polymerase complex (Fig. 2A and 2B), whereas TLR3-mediated activation of the IFN promoter was not influenced (Fig. 2C). Because it has been reported that the conserved flanking sequence lying on viral genomic RNA is required for the activation of the cap-snatching function of the influenza A virus polymerase (37Leahy M.B. Pritlove D.C. Poon L.L. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Honda A. Endo A. Mizumoto K. Ishihama A. J. Biol.

Virol. 2001; 75: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it was assumed that stimulation by both HCV 5′-UTR and poly(I-C) could not activate cap-snatching activity. Therefore, we concluded that the inhibitory effect of a viral polymerase on RIG-I-mediated IFNβ promoter activation was independent of its cap-snatching function. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that the expression of a viral polymerase did not inhibit TLR3-mediated IFNβ promoter activation. Although subcellular localization of RIG-I or MDA5 is different from that of TLR3, the overall induction pathway for type I IFN by RIG-I and MDA5 is mediated by the same signaling molecules as the pathway mediated by TLR3. These molecules transduce the signals to the same transcription factors, IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB, mediated by the intermediate signaling molecules, such as TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) and IKKϵ (IκB kinase ϵ) (40Bowie A.G. Unterholzner L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 41Takeuchi O. Akira S. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data, derived by using a reporter gene assay (Fig. 2, A–C), suggest that the targets of viral RNA polymerase are not these overlapping signaling molecules that inhibit the intracellular induction pathway for type I IFN. From these facts, we thought that there is a possibility that the viral polymerase complex targets to IPS-1 and inhibits its function, because IPS-1 is an adapter molecule that binds RIG-I and MDA5 but not TLR3. Initially, we investigated the effect of an expression of the influenza A virus polymerase to the IFNβ promoter activated by the overexpression of IPS-1. As shown in Fig. 2D, the results show that a viral polymerase strongly inhibited IFNβ promoter activation induced by the expression of IPS-1. To confirm that the viral polymerase specifically inhibits the IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway, we evaluated the effects of the viral polymerase on the IFNβ promoter activation induced by overexpression of IRF3. The results show that activation of the IFNβ promoter induced by overexpression of IRF3 was not affected by the expression of the viral polymerase (Fig. 2E). It is known that activation of the IFNβ promoter is regulated by IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB (40Bowie A.G. Unterholzner L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 41Takeuchi O. Akira S. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), and NF-κB is involved in the induction of a variety of inflammatory cytokines in addition to type I IFN (42Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3389) Google Scholar). Taking this into consideration, we used a reporter plasmid that carries the luciferase gene under the control of the synthetic NF-κB binding site (pNF-κB-luc; Promega) and evaluated the effect of the viral polymerase expression on IPS-1-induced NF-κB activation. The results show that the viral polymerase significantly inhibited NF-κB activation induced by the IPS-1 overexpression (Fig. 2F) but did not inhibit the activation induced by TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 2G). TNF-α is known to be an inflammatory cytokine belonging to the TNF superfamily and is also known to be a strong NF-κB inducer that activates a signaling pathway distinct from the IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway (43Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9441-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Finally, we examined whether IPS-1-mediated activation of IRF3 is inhibited by the expression of the viral RNA polymerase. It has been reported that the Ser396 residue of IRF-3 is phosphorylated by the infection of RNA viruses and the transfection of double-stranded RNA (44Bianchi K. Meier P. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 736-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and is also phosphorylated by the overexpression of IPS-1 (16Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar). We evaluated the activation of IRF3 by monitoring the phosphorylation level of IRF3 at Ser396, using its specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 2H, The results show that the phosphorylation of Ser396 in IRF3 was increased by the IPS-1 overexpression and was significantly inhibited by the expression of the viral RNA polymerase. These results suggest that the influenza A virus RNA polymerase has an activity to inhibit internal IFN induction pathway through the inhibition of IPS-1 function. To reveal the molecular mechanism for the inhibition of the IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway, we initially examined a possibility that viral RNA polymerase inhibits the IPS-1 function through the binding to the IPS-1. To investigate the binding of a viral polymerase with IPS-1, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay. IPS-1 with PA, PB1, or PB2 was expressed in HEK293 cells, and the binding of IPS-1 with PA, PB1, or PB2 was analyzed. Each component of the influenza viral polymerase complex was co-immunoprecipitated with IPS-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicated that all subunits of a viral RNA polymerase have the ability to bind with IPS-1. Next, we investigated whether all components of viral polymerase bind to IPS-1 simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, PA and PB2 were detected to have the same mobility by Western blotting, so it was difficult to distinguish between the two proteins. To resolve this problem, we constructed a Myc-tagged PB2 expression vector. Expression vectors for HA-tagged PA, PB1, Myc-tagged PB2, and FLAG-tagged IPS-1 were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG resin. The results show that all components of the viral polymerase were co-immunoprecipitated with IPS-1 at the same time (Fig. 3C). A viral polymerase forms a stable complex (1Neumann G. Brownlee G.G. Fodor E. Kawaoka Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 283: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 36Deng T. Sharps J. Fodor E. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8669-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 45Hwang J.S. Yamada K. Honda A. Nakade K. Ishihama A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4074-4084Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and we confirmed that the N-terminal epitope-tagged polymerase subunits used in this study are also able to form a complex (Fig. 1). From these results, it is likely that a viral polymerase binds to IPS-1 as a complex. Finally, we investigated whether the viral polymerase binds to IPS-1 in virus-infected cells. The PB2 proteins in the lysates of the influenza virus-infected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PB2 monoclonal antibody, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3D, the results indicate that PA and PB1 subunits were largely co-immunoprecipitated with PB2, and IPS-1 was also co-immunoprecipitated together with these proteins. The data suggested that the PB2 subunit binds to IPS-1 in the virus-infected cells and probably makes a complex. To investigate which subunit of viral polymerase is responsible for the inhibition of IPS-1 function, we examined the inhibitory activity of each polymerase subunit by using a reporter gene assay. Each polymerase subunit and NS1 were independently expressed in HEK293 cells together with RIG-I, and the cells were stimulated with single-stranded RNA derived from the influenza virus matrix (M) segment. The results indicated that IFNβ promoter activation by single-stranded RNA was equally inhibited by each subunit of the viral polymerase (Fig. 4A). However, the expression level of PB1 was higher than that of PA and PB2 (Fig. 4B). In addition, the expression level of NS1 was higher than that of PA, PB1, and PB2. However, the inhibitory activity of NS1 on IFNβ promoter activation was detected as stronger than that of each polymerase. Therefore, it may be assumed that the inhibitory effect of PB2 on IFNβ promoter activation was very strong. Next, we adjusted the amount of expression vectors for the transfection to equalize the protein expression level of each subunit, and then we tested their inhibitory effect on IPS-1-induced INFβ promoter activation. The results show that the relative inhibitory activity of PB2 on IFNβ promoter activation depended on the PB1/PB2 heterodimer and the viral polymerase complex (Fig. 4C). To confirm this strong inhibitory activity of PB2 against the IPS-1 function, we investigated the inhibitory activities of each viral polymerase component on IPS-1-mediated activation of NF-κB by using a reporter gene assay. The results show that NF-κB activation by overexpression of IPS-1 was also most strongly inhibited by PB2 (Fig. 4D). The amounts of transfected expression plasmids for viral polymerase subunits and NS1 were the same in this case. In addition, because NS1 binds to PI3K and activates the NF-κB pathway (46Hale B.G.

https://openalex.org/W2076422568,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single stranded RNAs with a key role in post-transcriptional regulation of thousands of genes across numerous species. While several computational methods are currently available for identifying miRNA genes, accurate prediction of the mature miRNA remains a challenge. Existing approaches fall short in predicting the location of mature miRNAs but also in finding the functional strand(s) of miRNA precursors. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we present a computational tool that incorporates a Naive Bayes classifier to identify mature miRNA candidates based on sequence and secondary structure information of their miRNA precursors. We take into account both positive (true mature miRNAs) and negative (same-size non-mature miRNA sequences) examples to optimize sensitivity as well as specificity. Our method can accurately predict the start position of experimentally verified mature miRNAs for both human and mouse, achieving a significantly larger (often double) performance accuracy compared with two existing methods. Moreover, the method exhibits a very high generalization performance on miRNAs from two other organisms. More importantly, our method provides direct evidence about the features of miRNA precursors which may determine the location of the mature miRNA. We find that the triplet of positions 7, 8 and 9 from the mature miRNA end towards the closest hairpin have the largest discriminatory power, are relatively conserved in terms of sequence composition (mostly contain a Uracil) and are located within or in very close proximity to the hairpin loop, suggesting the existence of a possible recognition site for Dicer and associated proteins. Conclusions This work describes a novel algorithm for identifying the start position of mature miRNA(s) produced by miRNA precursors. Our tool has significantly better (often double) performance than two existing approaches and provides new insights about the potential use of specific sequence/structural information as recognition signals for Dicer processing.

https://openalex.org/W2056852384,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia among senile subjects. It has been proposed that AD can be caused by defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Given the fundamental contribution of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) for the respiratory chain, there have been a number of studies investigating the association between mtDNA inherited variants and multifactorial diseases, however no general consensus has been reached yet on the correlation between mtDNA haplogroups and AD.We applied for the first time a high resolution analysis (sequencing of displacement loop and restriction analysis of specific markers in the coding region of mtDNA) to investigate the possible association between mtDNA-inherited sequence variation and AD in 936 AD patients and 776 cognitively assessed normal controls from central and northern Italy. Among over 40 mtDNA sub-haplogroups analysed, we found that sub-haplogroup H5 is a risk factor for AD (OR=1.85, 95% CI:1.04-3.23) in particular for females (OR=2.19, 95% CI:1.06-4.51) and independently from the APOE genotype. Multivariate logistic regression revealed an interaction between H5 and age. When the whole sample is considered, the H5a subgroup of molecules, harboring the 4336 transition in the tRNAGln gene, already associated to AD in early studies, was about threefold more represented in AD patients than in controls (2.0% vs 0.8%; p=0.031), and it might account for the increased frequency of H5 in AD patients (4.2% vs 2.3%). The complete re-sequencing of the 56 mtDNAs belonging to H5 revealed that AD patients showed a trend towards a higher number (p=0.052) of sporadic mutations in tRNA and rRNA genes when compared with controls.Our results indicate that high resolution analysis of inherited mtDNA sequence variation can help in identifying both ancient polymorphisms defining sub-haplogroups and the accumulation of sporadic mutations associated with complex traits such as AD."

https://openalex.org/W2075130445,"Delivering extinction trials minutes after fear conditioning yields only a short-term fear suppression that fully recovers the following day. Because extinction has been reported to increase CS-evoked spike firing and spontaneous bursting in the infralimbic (IL) division of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), we explored the possibility that this immediate extinction deficit is related to altered mPFC function. Single-units were simultaneously recorded in rats from neurons in IL and the prelimbic (PrL) division of the mPFC during an extinction session conducted 10 minutes (immediate) or 24 hours (delayed) after auditory fear conditioning. In contrast to previous reports, IL neurons exhibited CS-evoked responses early in extinction training in both immediate and delayed conditions and these responses decreased in magnitude over the course of extinction training. During the retention test, CS-evoked firing in IL was significantly greater in animals that failed to acquire extinction. Spontaneous bursting during the extinction and test sessions was also different in the immediate and delayed groups. There were no group differences in PrL activity during extinction or retention testing. Alterations in both spontaneous and CS-evoked neuronal activity in the IL may contribute to the immediate extinction deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2112807691,"Background Cells resident in certain hollow organs are subjected routinely to large transient stretches, including every adherent cell resident in lungs, heart, great vessels, gut, and bladder. We have shown recently that in response to a transient stretch the adherent eukaryotic cell promptly fluidizes and then gradually resolidifies, but mechanism is not yet understood. Principal Findings In the isolated human bladder smooth muscle cell, here we applied a 10% transient stretch while measuring cell traction forces, elastic modulus, F-actin imaging and the F-actin/G-actin ratio. Immediately after a transient stretch, F-actin levels and cell stiffness were lower by about 50%, and traction forces were lower by about 70%, both indicative of prompt fluidization. Within 5min, F-actin levels recovered completely, cell stiffness recovered by about 90%, and traction forces recovered by about 60%, all indicative of resolidification. The extent of the fluidization response was uninfluenced by a variety of signaling inhibitors, and, surprisingly, was localized to the unstretch phase of the stretch-unstretch maneuver in a manner suggestive of cytoskeletal catch bonds. When we applied an “unstretch-restretch” (transient compression), rather than a “stretch-unstretch” (transient stretch), the cell did not fluidize and the actin network did not depolymerize. Conclusions Taken together, these results implicate extremely rapid actin disassembly in the fluidization response, and slow actin reassembly in the resolidification response. In the bladder smooth muscle cell, the fluidization response to transient stretch occurs not through signaling pathways, but rather through release of increased tensile forces that drive acute disassociation of actin."
https://openalex.org/W2020702702,"Background MBD5 and MBD6 are two uncharacterized mammalian proteins that contain a putative Methyl-Binding Domain (MBD). In the proteins MBD1, MBD2, MBD4, and MeCP2, this domain allows the specific recognition of DNA containing methylated cytosine; as a consequence, the proteins serve as interpreters of DNA methylation, an essential epigenetic mark. It is unknown whether MBD5 or MBD6 also bind methylated DNA; this question has interest for basic research, but also practical consequences for human health, as MBD5 deletions are the likely cause of certain cases of mental retardation. Principal Findings Here we report the first functional characterization of MBD5 and MBD6. We have observed that the proteins colocalize with heterochromatin in cultured cells, and that this localization requires the integrity of their MBD. However, heterochromatic localization is maintained in cells with severely decreased levels of DNA methylation. In vitro, neither MBD5 nor MBD6 binds any of the methylated sequences DNA that were tested. Conclusions Our data suggest that MBD5 and MBD6 are unlikely to be methyl-binding proteins, yet they may contribute to the formation or function of heterochromatin. One isoform of MBD5 is highly expressed in oocytes, which suggests a possible role in epigenetic reprogramming after fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2047273027,"Background A combination of levodopa (L-DOPA) and carbidopa is the most commonly-used treatment for symptom management in Parkinson's disease. Studies have shown that concomitant use of a COMT inhibitor is highly beneficial in controlling the wearing-off phenomenon by improving L-DOPA bioavailability as well as brain entry. The present study sought to determine whether (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a common tea polyphenol, can serve as a naturally-occurring COMT inhibitor that also possesses neuroprotective actions. Methodology/Principal Findings Using both in vitro and in vivo models, we investigated the modulating effects of EGCG on L-DOPA methylation as well as on chemically induced oxidative neuronal damage and degeneration. EGCG strongly inhibited human liver COMT-mediated O-methylation of L-DOPA in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro, with an average IC50 of 0.36 µM. Oral administration of EGCG moderately lowered the accumulation of 3-O-methyldopa in the plasma and striatum of rats treated with L-DOPA + carbidopa. In addition, EGCG also reduced glutamate-induced oxidative cytotoxicity in cultured HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells through inactivation of the nuclear factor κB-signaling pathway. Under in vivo conditions, administration of EGCG exerted a strong protective effect against kainic acid-induced oxidative neuronal death in the hippocampus of rats. Conclusions/Significance These observations suggest that oral administration of EGCG may have significant beneficial effects in Parkinson's patients treated with L-DOPA and carbidopa by exerting a modest inhibition of L-DOPA methylation plus a strong neuroprotection against oxidative damage and degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2072563743,"The accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers a cellular process known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). One of the earliest responses is the attenuation of protein translation. Little is known about the role that Ca2+ mobilization plays in the early UPR. Work from our group has shown that cytosolic phosphorylation of calnexin (CLNX) controls Ca2+ uptake into the ER via the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) 2b.Here, we demonstrate that calcineurin (CN), a Ca2+ dependent phosphatase, associates with the (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and promotes PERK auto-phosphorylation. This association, in turn, increases the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha (eIF2-alpha) and attenuates protein translation. Data supporting these conclusions were obtained from co-immunoprecipitations, pull-down assays, in-vitro kinase assays, siRNA treatments and [35S]-methionine incorporation measurements. The interaction of CN with PERK was facilitated at elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and involved the cytosolic domain of PERK. CN levels were rapidly increased by ER stressors, which could be blocked by siRNA treatments for CN-Aalpha in cultured astrocytes. Downregulation of CN blocked subsequent ER-stress-induced increases in phosphorylated elF2-alpha. CN knockdown in Xenopus oocytes predisposed them to induction of apoptosis. We also found that CLNX was dephosphorylated by CN when Ca2+ increased. These data were obtained from [gamma32P]-CLNX immunoprecipitations and Ca2+ imaging measurements. CLNX was dephosphorylated when Xenopus oocytes were treated with ER stressors. Dephosphorylation was pharmacologically blocked by treatment with CN inhibitors. Finally, evidence is presented that PERK phosphorylates CN-A at low resting levels of Ca2+. We further show that phosphorylated CN-A exhibits decreased phosphatase activity, consistent with this regulatory mechanism being shut down as ER homeostasis is re-established.Our data suggest two new complementary roles for CN in the regulation of the early UPR. First, CN binding to PERK enhances inhibition of protein translation to allow the cell time to recover. The induction of the early UPR, as indicated by increased P-elF2alpha, is critically dependent on a translational increase in CN-Aalpha. Second, CN dephosphorylates CLNX and likely removes inhibition of SERCA2b activity, which would aid the rapid restoration of ER Ca2+ homeostasis."

We recorded demographic data, antenatal prescription of intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and bed net use, and examined finger-prick blood for malaria parasites and hemoglobin concentration. In 4,712 women, we examined placental blood for malaria parasites and recorded the infant's birth weight. Peripheral and placental parasitemia prevalence declined from 23.5% to 5.0% and from 25.2% to 6.8% respectively. Smaller declines in prevalence of low birth weight and anemia were observed. Coverage of intermittent preventive treatment and bednets increased. Number of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine doses received correlated inversely with placental parasitemia (Odds Ratio (95% CI): 0.79 (0.68, 0.91)), maternal anemia (0.81, (0.73, 0.90)) and low birth weight from 1997-2001 (0.63 (0.53, 0.75)), but not from 2002-2006. Bednet use protected from peripheral parasitemia (0.47, (0.37, 0.60)) and placental parasitemia (0.41, (0.31, 0.54)) and low birth weight (0.75 (0.59, 0.95)) but not anemia throughout the study. Compared to women without nets who did not receive 2-dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, women using nets and receiving 2-dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine were less likely to have parasitemia or low birth weight babies. Women receiving 2-dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone had little evidence of protection whereas bednets alone gave intermediate protection.Increased bednet coverage explains changes in parasitemia and birth weight among pregnant women better than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine use. High bed net coverage, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance, may be contributing to its apparent loss of effectiveness."

Historically, the lacZ gene encoding the enzyme β-galactosidase has been the most common reporter gene and many chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates are well established, but limited to histology or in vitro assays. We now present a novel approach for in vivo detection of β-galactosidase using optical imaging to detect light emission following administration of the chemiluminescent 1,2-dioxetane substrate Galacto-Light PlusTM. Methodology and Principal Findings B-gal activity was visualized in stably transfected human MCF7-lacZ tumors growing in mice. LacZ tumors were identified versus contralateral wild type tumors as controls, based on two- to tenfold greater light emission following direct intra tumoral or intravenous administration of reporter substrate. The 1,2-dioxetane substrate is commercially available as a kit for microplate-based assays for β-gal detection, and we have adapted it for in vivo application. Typically, 100 µl substrate mixture was administered intravenously and light emission was detected from the lacZ tumor immediately with gradual decrease over the next 20 mins. Imaging was also undertaken in transgenic ROSA26 mice following subcutaneous or intravenous injection of substrate mixture. Conclusion and Significance Light emission was detectable using standard instrumentation designed for more traditional bioluminescent imaging.

https://openalex.org/W1980129194,"Background Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be considered the result of a failure to recover after a traumatic experience. Here we studied possible protective and therapeutic aspects of environmental enrichment (with and without a running wheel) in Sprague Dawley rats exposed to an inescapable foot shock procedure (IFS). Methodology/Principal Findings IFS induced long-lasting contextual and non-contextual anxiety, modeling some aspects of PTSD. Even 10 weeks after IFS the rats showed reduced locomotion in an open field. The antidepressants imipramine and escitalopram did not improve anxiogenic behavior following IFS. Also the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor sodium butyrate did not alleviate the IFS induced immobility. While environmental enrichment (EE) starting two weeks before IFS did not protect the animals from the behavioral effects of the shocks, exposure to EE either immediately after the shock or one week later induced complete recovery three weeks after IFS. In the next set of experiments a running wheel was added to the EE to enable voluntary exercise (EE/VE). This also led to reduced anxiety. Importantly, this behavioral recovery was not due to a loss of memory for the traumatic experience. The behavioral recovery correlated with an increase in cell proliferation in hippocampus, a decrease in the tissue levels of noradrenalin and increased turnover of 5-HT in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Conclusions/Significance This animal study shows the importance of (physical) exercise in the treatment of psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder and points out the possible role of EE in studying the mechanism of recovery from anxiety disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2062109421,"One fundamental concept in the context of biological systems on which researches have flourished in the past decade is that of the apparent robustness of these systems, i.e., their ability to resist to perturbations or constraints induced by external or boundary elements such as electromagnetic fields acting on neural networks, micro-RNAs acting on genetic networks and even hormone flows acting both on neural and genetic networks. Recent studies have shown the importance of addressing the question of the environmental robustness of biological networks such as neural and genetic networks. In some cases, external regulatory elements can be given a relevant formal representation by assimilating them to or modeling them by boundary conditions. This article presents a generic mathematical approach to understand the influence of boundary elements on the dynamics of regulation networks, considering their attraction basins as gauges of their robustness. The application of this method on a real genetic regulation network will point out a mathematical explanation of a biological phenomenon which has only been observed experimentally until now, namely the necessity of the presence of gibberellin for the flower of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana to develop normally."

Alanine-scanning mutagenesis, bioinformatics, and molecular modeling were used to identify several “hot spots,” such as Val42, Met44, Ala71, Lys93, Gly94, and Tyr96, forming a continuous protein-protein surface of about 830 Å2, bearing very conserved amino acids among coronaviruses. Because nsp16 carries RNA cap 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′O-MTase) activity only in the presence of its interacting partner nsp10 (Bouvet, M., Debarnot, C., Imbert, I., Selisko, B., Snijder, E.

Most changes that disrupted the nsp10-nsp16 interaction without structural perturbations were shown to abrogate stimulation of nsp16 RNA cap 2′O-MTase activity. More strikingly, the Y96A mutation abrogates stimulation of nsp16 2′O-MTase activity, whereas Y96F overstimulates it.

Because nsp16 carries RNA cap 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′O-MTase) activity only in the presence of its interacting partner nsp10 (Bouvet, M., Debarnot, C., Imbert, I., Selisko, B., Snijder, E. J., Canard, B., and Decroly, E. (2010) PLoS Pathog. 6, e1000863), functional consequences of mutations on this surface were evaluated biochemically. Most changes that disrupted the nsp10-nsp16 interaction without structural perturbations were shown to abrogate stimulation of nsp16 RNA cap 2′O-MTase activity. More strikingly, the Y96A mutation abrogates stimulation of nsp16 2′O-MTase activity, whereas Y96F overstimulates it. Thus, the nsp10-nsp16 interface may represent an attractive target for antivirals against human and animal pathogenic coronaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2080407205,"It is well recognized that compared with men, women have better ultra-endurance capacity, oxidize more fat during endurance exercise, and are more resistant to fat oxidation defects i.e. diet-induced insulin resistance. Several groups have shown that the mRNA and protein transcribed and translated from genes related to transport of fatty acids into the muscle are greater in women than men; however, the mechanism(s) for the observed sex differences in fat oxidation remains to be determined. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were obtained from moderately active men (N = 12) and women (N = 11) at rest to examine mRNA and protein content of genes involved in lipid oxidation. Our results show that women have significantly higher protein content for tri-functional protein alpha (TFPα), very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) (P<0.05). There was no significant sex difference in the expression of short-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD), or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα), or PPARγ, genes potentially involved in the transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism. In conclusion, women have more protein content of the major enzymes involved in long and medium chain fatty acid oxidation which could account for the observed differences in fat oxidation during exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2100003461,"Genetically modified mice carrying engrafted human tissues provide useful models to study human cell biology in physiologically relevant contexts. However, there remain several obstacles limiting the compatibility of human cells within their mouse hosts. Among these is inadequate cross-reactvitiy between certain mouse cytokines and human cellular receptors, depriving the graft of important survival and growth signals. To circumvent this problem, we utilized a lentivirus-based delivery system to express physiologically relevant levels of human interleukin-7 (hIL-7) in Rag2-/-gammac-/- mice following a single intravenous injection. hIL-7 promoted homeostatic proliferation of both adoptively transferred and endogenously generated T-cells in Rag2-/-gammac-/- Human Immune System (HIS) mice. Interestingly, we found that hIL-7 increased T lymphocyte numbers in the spleens of HIV infected HIS mice without affecting viral load. Taken together, our study unveils a versatile approach to deliver human cytokines to HIS mice, to both improve engraftment and determine the impact of cytokines on human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2024728475,"Extracellular recordings in primates have identified two types of neurons in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe): high frequency pausers (HFP) and low frequency bursters (LFB). The aim of the current study was to test whether the properties of HFP and LFB neurons recorded extracellularly in the primate GPe are linked to cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of action potential (AP) firing. Thus, we recorded from primate and rat globus pallidus neurons. Extracellular recordings in primates revealed that in addition to differences in firing patterns the APs of neurons in these two groups have different widths (APex). To quantitatively investigate this difference and to explore the heterogeneity of pallidal neurons we carried out cell-attached and whole-cell recordings from acute slices of the rat globus pallidus (GP, the rodent homolog of the primate GPe), examining both spontaneous and evoked activity. Several parameters related to the extracellular activity were extracted in order to subdivide the population of recorded GP neurons into groups. Statistical analysis showed that the GP neurons in the rodents may be differentiated along six cellular parameters into three subgroups. Combining two of these groups allowed a better separation of the population along nine parameters. Four of these parameters (Fmax, APamp, APhw, and AHPs amplitude) form a subset, suggesting that one group of neurons may generate APs at significantly higher frequencies than the other group. This may suggest that the differences between the HFP and LFB neurons in the primate are related to fundamental underlying differences in their cellular properties."
https://openalex.org/W2026080473,"Cancer cells are often associated with secondary chromosomal rearrangements, such as deletions, inversions, and translocations, which could be the consequence of unrepaired/misrepaired DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Nonhomologous DNA end joining is one of the most common pathways to repair DSBs in higher eukaryotes. By using oligomeric DNA substrates mimicking various endogenous DSBs in a cell-free system, we studied end joining (EJ) in different cancer cell lines. We found that the efficiency of EJ varies among cancer cells; however, there was no remarkable difference in the mechanism and expression of EJ proteins. Interestingly, cancer cells with lower levels of EJ possessed elevated expression of BCL2 and vice versa. Removal of BCL2 by immunoprecipitation or protein fractionation led to elevated EJ. More importantly, we show that overexpression of BCL2 or the addition of purified BCL2 led to the down-regulation of EJ. Further, we found that BCL2 interacts with KU proteins both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, our results suggest that EJ in cancer cells could be negatively regulated by the anti-apoptotic protein, BCL2, and this may contribute toward increased chromosomal abnormalities in cancer.

DSBs can be generated by both intrinsic (physiologic processes, such as replication, V(D)J recombination, class switch recombination, meiosis, and generation of free radicals during oxidative metabolism) and extrinsic (ionizing radiations and chemotherapeutic drugs) agents (1Lieber M.R.

There are two major modes of repair of DSBs: homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) (3Wyman C. Kanaar R. Annu. Rev.

Homologous recombination requires a minimum of 100-bp homology, whereas NHEJ requires limited or no homology (5Sonoda E. Hochegger H. Saberi A. Taniguchi Y. Takeda S.

Although homologous recombination can repair DSBs in higher eukaryotes, it is restricted to the late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, whereas NHEJ is active throughout the cell cycle (7Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 8Lieber M.R. Ma Y.

The mechanism of NHEJ has been elucidated in the past several years. NHEJ involves a complex network of proteins, which include KU70/80, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, LIGASE IV, ARTEMIS, and XLF (3Wyman C. Kanaar R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 363-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 4Lieber M.R. Annu. Rev.

KU proteins, which act as a heterodimer, consist of KU70 and KU80; they recognize and bind to the DSBs and subsequently recruit DNA-PKcs to the site (13Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol.

The DNA ends are processed by ARTEMIS or a DNA-PKcs-ARTEMIS complex to create ligatable ends (16Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R.

The error-prone DNA polymerases, polymerase μ and λ, carry out DNA synthesis during the joining process (18Tseng H.M. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol.

Because NHEJ does not depend on a homologous partner to repair the breaks, in many instances, it can be error-prone. Deletions and insertions are the most common modifications seen at the NHEJ junctions (12Yano K. Morotomi-Yano K. Adachi N. Akiyama H. J. Radiat. Res. 2009; 50: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Ma Y. Lu H. Tippin B. Goodman M.F. Shimazaki N. Koiwai O. Hsieh C.L. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol.

Given that unrepaired DSBs in organisms can lead to chromosomal translocations and genomic instability, resulting in cancer or apoptosis, the quick sealing mechanism, NHEJ, is crucial for maintaining the genomic integrity (24Zhu C.

However, it is possible that the end joining observed in in vitro assays using crude cell extracts could also be accounted for by single strand annealing (SSA) and alternative NHEJ, besides the classical NHEJ. Studies on various cancer cells have revealed the presence of chromosomal abnormalities, including deletions and chromosomal translocations (25Nambiar M. Kari V. Raghavan S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Albertson D.G. Collins C. McCormick F. Gray J.W. Nat.

Based on this, it has been suggested that cancer cells may have either impaired (29Mérel P. Prieur A. Pfeiffer P. Delattre O.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1798-1805PubMed Google Scholar). BCL2, an anti-apoptotic protein, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, upon activation can promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (35Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1693s-1700sPubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that chromosomal translocations, such as t(14;18) juxtapose the BCL2 gene to the immunoglobulin enhancer, leading to overexpression of BCL2 in B lymphocytes (36Bakhshi A. Jensen J.P. Goldman P. Wright J.J. McBride O.W. Epstein A.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1985; 41: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 37Tsujimoto Y. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C.M. Science. 1985; 228: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Such translocations could lead to deregulation of apoptotic pathways, culminating into neoplasia (25Nambiar M. Kari V. Raghavan S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested the plausible role of BCL2 in genomic instability and development of cancer (38Youn C.K. Cho H.J. Kim S.H. Kim H.B. Kim M.H. Chang I.Y. Lee J.S. Chung M.H. Hahm K.S.

In another study, it was shown that BCL2 can interact with KU proteins through its BH1 and BH4 domains and decrease the efficiency of KU binding to DNA ends (40Wang Q. Gao F. May W.S. Zhang Y. Flagg T. Deng X. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 488-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In a recent study, it has been suggested that multipotent hair follicle bulge stem cells are more radioresistant due to higher levels of BCL2 and enhanced DNA repair activity, leading to an attenuated p53 response (41Sotiropoulou P.A. Candi A. Mascré G. De Clercq S. Youssef K.K. Lapouge G. Dahl E. Semeraro C. Denecker G. Marine J.C. Blanpain C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that human cancer cell lines repair different DSBs with varying efficiency, although the mechanism of EJ is comparable between cancer cells. We further show that the cancer cells with higher expression of BCL2 possessed lower EJ activity, whereas the ones with lower BCL2 expression showed higher EJ. Removal of BCL2 from cancer cell lines by protein fractionation or immunoprecipitation enhanced the EJ activity, whereas the overexpression or addition of purified BCL2 led to down-regulation of EJ. Finally, we show that although BCL2 is a mitochondrial membrane protein, it is also present in the nucleus at lower levels and interacts with KU proteins, which could be one of the mechanisms by which BCL2 down-regulates EJ in cancer cells. Chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma and Amresco. Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Radioisotope-labeled nucleotides were purchased from BRIT (Hyderabad, India). Culture media were from Sera Laboratory International Ltd. (West Sussex, UK), and FBS was from Invitrogen. Human leukemia cell lines CEM and K562, Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines RAJI and DAUDI, cervical cancer cell line HeLa, and lung cancer cell line A549 were purchased from the National Center for Cell Science (Pune, India). Lymphoblastoid cell line GM00558B and B-cell leukemia cell lines REH and NALM6 were kind gifts from Dr. Michael Lieber. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640, DMEM, Ham's media, or minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics in appropriate conditions. Cell-free extracts were prepared as described earlier with minor modifications (42Sathees C.R. Raman M.J. Mutat. Res. 1999; 433: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43Sharma S. Choudhary B. Raghavan S.C. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cancer cell lines of interest were cultured in bulk and washed in PBS. Approximately 8 × 107 cells were resuspended in 4 ml of hypotonic buffer (Buffer A: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF) and incubated for 20 min. Cells were homogenized in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), and an equal volume of ice-cold buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 25% sucrose, and 50% glycerol) was added, followed by 1 ml of neutralized, saturated ammonium sulfate solution. The resulting lysate was stirred gently and centrifuged for 3 h at 32,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (model L8-70M) at 2 °C. Proteins were precipitated using ammonium sulfate (0.33 g/ml) from the supernatant, pelleted, dissolved, and dialyzed in buffer C (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.1 m KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 17% glycerol). The clarified extract was aliquoted, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford's colorimetric assay and was generally between 3 and 5 mg/ml for each of the extracts. The oligomers listed were gel-purified as described (44Naik A.K. Lieber M.R. Raghavan S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7587-7597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 1). The 5′-end labeling of the oligomeric DNA was done using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, purified, and stored at −20 °C until use (44Naik A.K. Lieber M.R. Raghavan S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7587-7597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The oligomeric DNA substrates (75 bp) containing 5′ compatible overhangs were prepared by slow annealing of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled TSK1 with cold complementary oligomer TSK2 (1:3 ratio) in the presence of 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA (43Sharma S. Choudhary B. Raghavan S.C. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, double-stranded DNA containing 5′-5′ and 5′-3′ noncompatible overhangs were prepared by mixing [γ-32P]ATP-labeled TSK1 with cold complementary oligomers VK11 and VK13, respectively. Blunt-ended substrate was prepared by annealing radiolabeled VK7 with cold VK8. EJ reactions were performed as described earlier with modifications (43Sharma S. Choudhary B. Raghavan S.C. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 45Raghavan S.C. Raman M.J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1297-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Reactions were done in a volume of 10 μl by mixing 4 nm end-labeled DNA substrate in EJ buffer containing 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 50 μm dNTPs, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 μm cold strand and 0.1 μg of BSA at 37 °C for 2 or 4 h. 5 μg of cell-free extracts were used per reaction, unless mentioned otherwise. The EJ reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA (10 mm) and proteinase K. The reaction products were deproteinized by phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation in the presence of glycogen. The pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of Tris (10 mm), EDTA (1 mm), resolved on 8% denaturing PAGE, dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and scanned using an FLA9000 phosphor imager (Fuji). The resulting image was analyzed using Multi Gauge (version 3.0) software. For quantitation, the area (rectangle) covering the DNA band of interest was selected, and the intensity was calculated and expressed as photo-stimulated luminescence (PSL) units. The same sized rectangle was used to determine background, which was subtracted. The intensity measured from each band in a lane, resulting from EJ, was added and plotted. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described earlier (46Wang Y.D. Caldwell R.B. Subcell. Biochem. 2006; 40: 439-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, K562, CEM, and REH cells were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, and 320 mm sucrose supplemented with protease inhibitors and 1 mm DTT). The cytoplasmic proteins were separated by centrifugation. Nuclear proteins were extracted using buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol along with protease inhibitors and 1 mm DTT). The extracts were stored at −80 °C until use. The purity of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts was tested by immunoblotting using the markers α-tubulin and histone 3, respectively. T7 exonuclease digestion was performed by incubating purified EJ products with either increasing concentrations or 5 units of T7 exonuclease (New England Biolabs) at 25 °C for 2 h. In some cases, a fraction of EJ products was digested with XhoI (4 units) (37 °C for 4 h) prior to T7 exonuclease digestion. The products were then resolved by 8% denaturing PAGE, which was dried and exposed. The EJ products of interest were cut out from PAGE, and DNA was eluted in a solution containing Tris (10 mm), EDTA (1 mm) and NaCl (0.5 m). The purified DNA was then used for PCR amplification of EJ junctions using the primers VK24 and SS3. Gel-purified PCR products were cloned into TA vector, and the presence of insert was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing (Macrogen Inc.). For immunoblotting analysis, ∼20 μg of protein was resolved on 8–10% SDS-PAGE (47Chiruvella K.K. Kari V. Choudhary B. Nambiar M. Ghanta R.G. Raghavan S.C. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 4066-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore), blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder, and probed with appropriate primary antibodies against KU70, KU80, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, LIGASE IV, ARTEMIS, polymerase λ, pATM, p53, MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 and secondary antibodies as per standard protocol. The blots were developed using chemiluminescent detection solution (ImmobilonTM Western, Millipore) and scanned by a gel documentation system (LAS 3000, Fuji). Protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) were activated by immersing in water, followed by incubation in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min on ice. The activated beads were incubated with anti-BCL2 or anti-KU80 antibody at 4 °C for 5–8 h to generate antibody-bead conjugate. It was then pelleted, washed, and incubated with cell-free extract at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was collected, and the immunoprecipitation was verified by Western blot analysis. BCL2-depleted cell-free extracts were used for the EJ assay. For fractionation of cell-free extracts by size exclusion chromatography, a Bio-Gel P100 column (Bio-Rad) was used. Approximately, 2 mg of CEM cell extracts were used for fractionation as per the manufacturer's protocol. The column was washed and equilibrated with dialysis buffer. The protein was loaded and allowed to separate based on molecular size. Fractions were collected, concentration of protein was estimated, and fractions were stored at −80 °C. Fractions containing partially purified BCL2 protein (fractions 15–17) were mixed in a ratio of 1:1:1, and increasing concentrations were added (20, 40, and 60 μg) to K562 (2.5 μg) cell-free extracts (incubated for 30 min on ice). EJ assay was performed on compatible and noncompatible ends as described above. BCL2 was amplified from mammalian expression vector, NIH_MGC_92 (Open Biosystems) using primers MS50 and MS51 (supplemental Table 1). The fragment was digested with NheI and XhoI, gel-purified, and ligated to pET28a following digestion with same enzymes. The clone was sequenced, and deletion of the C-terminal 70 amino acids was confirmed. For BCL2, the C-terminal truncation is necessary for the protein to be in the soluble fraction. Human BCL2 was expressed in Escherichia coli. In brief, plasmid pET28a-His6-BCL2 was transformed into E. coli, BL21(DE3) and induced to express His6-BCL2 fusion protein at 37 °C with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8), 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 30 min following the addition of 1 mg/ml lysozyme and PMSF. The cells were sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and loaded on Ni+-NTA resin (Novagen). The protein was eluted with elution buffer (0.33 m imidazole in 0.3 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)). The elute was collected and dialyzed (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.1 m KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 17% glycerol). The purity of recombinant protein was checked by PAGE, and the concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Finally, the purified recombinant protein was stored at −80 °C. Approximately 20 μg of BCL2 expression vector (NIH_MGC_92) was transfected by electroporation using a Gene Pulser X-Cell (Bio-Rad) into 3 × 106 cells at 875 V and 50 microfarads. Following transfection, the cells were grown in RPMI containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and cell-free extracts were prepared. The EJ assay was carried out with 5 μg of protein on 5′ overhangs and 5′-5′ noncompatible ends, as mentioned above. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (5 min), and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (10 min) at room temperature. BSA (0.1%) was used for blocking (30 min) and subsequently incubated with appropriate primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. FITC- and phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibodies raised in goats and mice, respectively, were used for detection of the signal. After washing, the cells were stained with DAPI, mounted, and observed under a fluorescence microscope using specific filters for fluorescein (NIKON). In selected cases, slides were observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus). Cell-free extracts were prepared from various cancer cell lines derived from patients of chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562), T-cell leukemia (CEM), B-cell leukemia (REH and NALM6), Burkitt's lymphoma (RAJI and DAUDI), lung cancer (A549), and cervical cancer (HeLa). GM00558B, a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a healthy individual, was used as control. The different steps involved during the EJ assay and four different substrates used for assaying EJ are outlined (supplemental Fig. 1). Integrity of the substrates was confirmed by P1 nuclease digestion (supplemental Fig. 2). To compare EJ efficiency in different cell lines, protein concentration was estimated by Bradford assay and SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 3, A–D). The overall protein profile in all cell lines was comparable. For the end joining assay, 5 μg of cell-free extracts was used, based on the protein titration assay (data not shown). Time-kinetics studies showed that the optimum joining activity was at around 2 h (compatible ends) or 4 h (noncompatible and blunt ends) of incubation (data not shown). First, we checked the joining efficiency of compatible ends using the cell-free extracts from different cancer cell lines. For this, we incubated a 75-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing 5′ overhangs with different cell extracts for 2 h in EJ buffer. Upon analysis of purified joined products on a denaturing PAGE, we found that the extracts catalyzed end-to-end joining of the substrates, resulting in dimerization, trimerization, and other levels of multimerization (Fig. 1A). In addition to the above joined products, bands were also visible between substrate and dimer bands, which were identified as circular products (see below) (Fig. 1A). The overall efficiency of joining varied among the different cancer cell extracts (Fig. 1, E and I). Similar to normal cell extracts, K562, DAUDI, and RAJI cells showed higher levels of joining (Fig. 1, E and I). CEM, REH, NALM6, and HeLa extracts exhibited poor joining (Fig. 1, E and I). Thus, studies using 5′ compatible termini showed that all cancer cell extracts were able to catalyze joining, albeit with different efficiencies. We have also used oligomeric DNA substrates containing blunt or noncompatible ends to mimic the endogenous DSBs within cells (supplemental Fig. 1B). Noncompatible termini cannot be joined by simple ligation because the overhangs at both ends of the substrates are nonligatable; hence, joining of such ends can take place only by EJ. In the present study, we have used two types of noncompatible ends, 5′-5′ and 5′-3′ overhangs (supplemental Fig. 1B). Results showed that cell-free extracts of GM00558B, K562, CEM, and RAJI were capable of joining the blunt ends (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–6). However, in all the cases, joining was weak and resulted only in dimer, of which REH showed least joining (Fig. 1, B and F). Similarly, the efficiency of blunt end joining was weak, even when A549, DAUDI, HeLa, and NALM6 cell extracts were used for the study. However, among the cell lines studied, DAUDI showed the highest blunt end joining activity (Fig. 1J). Thus, results suggest that blunt end joining catalyzed by cancer cells is less efficient as compared with 5′ compatible overhangs (Fig. 1, compare A, E, and I with B, F, and J), which was also consistent with the joining activity exhibited by T4 DNA ligase (data not shown). Further, restriction enzyme digestion analysis showed that most of the joined junctions were recleavable (data not shown), suggesting that joining occurred with minimum or no modifications. DNA end joining of 5′-5′ and 5′-3′ noncompatible overhangs was tested by incubating the respective [γ-32P]ATP-labeled substrates with cancer cell extracts. Results showed that overall efficiency of joining was lower in the case of noncompatible ends as compared with compatible ends (Fig. 1, compare A with C with D). Comparison of joining efficiency in cell lines using both of these substrates indicated that GM00558B, K562, RAJI, A549, and DAUDI cell-free extracts possessed higher EJ activity (Fig. 1, G, H, K, and L). Interestingly, the efficiency of joining was less in the case of CEM, REH, HeLa, and NALM6 (Fig. 1, G, H, K, and L). Hence, these results suggest that joining efficiency of compatible ends was higher compared with noncompatible or blunt ends in all of the cancer cell extracts. Further, the efficiency of joining varied among cancer cell lines irrespective of the termini. We observed 1–2 additional bands between DNA substrates and 150-bp dimer products (Fig. 1A). To identify the nature of the bands, we carried out T7 exonuclease digestion of these reaction products (Fig. 2A). T7 exonuclease is known to act in the 5′–3′ direction on a linear DNA but not on circular DNA. End joining reaction products resulting from K562 extracts were treated with increasing concentrations (0.1–10 units) or 5 units of T7 exonuclease at 25 °C for 2 h and resolved on an 8% denaturing PAGE. Results showed that T7 exonuclease was able to digest the bands corresponding to the substrate and linear dimer DNA but not the one in between (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3) (data not shown), suggesting the circular nature of the products. In order to confirm the results, we first linearized the joined products by XhoI digestion and then subjected them to T7 exonuclease treatment. Results showed that following digestion with XhoI, even the circularized band was sensitive to T7 exonuclease (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). Interestingly, one of the circular bands (Form I) was sensitive neither to XhoI nor to T7 exonuclease, possibly because of inherent distortion of each nucleotide due to circularization of apparently a 75-mer (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). Therefore, the results suggest that extracts were able to catalyze circularization of DNA substr"
https://openalex.org/W2055534075,"Background The neuropeptide, oxytocin (OXT), acts on brain circuits to inhibit food intake. Mutant mice lacking OXT (OXT knockout) overconsume salty and sweet (i.e. sucrose, saccharin) solutions. We asked if OXT might also act on taste buds via its receptor, OXTR. Methodology/Principal Findings Using RT-PCR, we detected the expression of OXTR in taste buds throughout the oral cavity, but not in adjacent non-taste lingual epithelium. By immunostaining tissues from OXTR-YFP knock-in mice, we found that OXTR is expressed in a subset of Glial-like (Type I) taste cells, and also in cells on the periphery of taste buds. Single-cell RT-PCR confirmed this cell-type assignment. Using Ca2+ imaging, we observed that physiologically appropriate concentrations of OXT evoked [Ca2+]i mobilization in a subset of taste cells (EC50 ∼33 nM). OXT-evoked responses were significantly inhibited by the OXTR antagonist, L-371,257. Isolated OXT-responsive taste cells were neither Receptor (Type II) nor Presynaptic (Type III) cells, consistent with our immunofluorescence observations. We also investigated the source of OXT peptide that may act on taste cells. Both RT-PCR and immunostaining suggest that the OXT peptide is not produced in taste buds or in their associated nerves. Finally, we also examined the morphology of taste buds from mice that lack OXTR. Taste buds and their constituent cell types appeared very similar in mice with two, one or no copies of the OXTR gene. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that OXT elicits Ca2+ signals via OXTR in murine taste buds. OXT-responsive cells are most likely a subset of Glial-like (Type I) taste cells. OXT itself is not produced locally in taste tissue and is likely delivered through the circulation. Loss of OXTR does not grossly alter the morphology of any of the cell types contained in taste buds. Instead, we speculate that OXT-responsive Glial-like (Type I) taste bud cells modulate taste signaling and afferent sensory output. Such modulation would complement central pathways of appetite regulation that employ circulating homeostatic and satiety signals."
https://openalex.org/W2029396420,"Cholesterol-rich lipid rafts act as signaling microdomains and can regulate receptor function. We have shown in HEK293 cells recombinant P2X1-4 receptors (ATP-gated ion channels) are expressed in lipid rafts. Localization to flotillin-rich lipid rafts was reduced by the detergent Triton X-100. This sensitivity to Triton X-100 was concentration- and subunit-dependent, demonstrating differential association of P2X1-4 receptors with lipid rafts. The importance of raft association to ATP-evoked P2X receptor responses was determined in patch clamp studies. The cholesterol-depleting agents methyl-β-cyclodextrin or filipin disrupt lipid rafts and reduced P2X1 receptor currents by >90%. In contrast, ATP-evoked P2X2-4 receptor currents were unaffected by lipid raft disruption. To determine the molecular basis of cholesterol sensitivity, we generated chimeric receptors replacing portions of the cholesterol-sensitive P2X1 receptor with the corresponding region from the insensitive P2X2 receptor. These chimeras identified the importance of the intracellular amino-terminal region between the conserved protein kinase C site and the first transmembrane segment for the sensitivity to cholesterol depletion. Mutation of any of the variant residues between P2X1 and P2X2 receptors in this region in the P2X1 receptor (residues 20–23 and 27–29) to cysteine removed cholesterol sensitivity. Cholesterol depletion did not change the ATP sensitivity or cell surface expression of P2X1 receptors. This suggests that cholesterol is normally needed to facilitate the opening/gating of ATP-bound P2X1 receptor channels, and mutations in the pre-first transmembrane segment region remove this requirement.

This suggests that cholesterol is normally needed to facilitate the opening/gating of ATP-bound P2X1 receptor channels, and mutations in the pre-first transmembrane segment region remove this requirement. The concept of ATP acting as an extracellular signaling molecule through P2 receptors was initially proposed by Burnstock in the 1970s (1Burnstock G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 166-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). It is now clear that ATP is released from a variety of sources, including nerves, astrocytes, and platelets, as well as the result of tissue damage or shear stress. ATP can then activate metabotropic P2Y receptors and ionotropic P2X receptors (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Seven mammalian P2X receptor subunits (P2X1-7) have been identified. These have two transmembrane domains, intracellular amino and carboxyl termini, a large extracellular ligand binding loop, and form functional trimeric ion channels (3North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar, 4Roberts J.A. Vial C. Digby H.R. Agboh K.C. Wen H. Atterbury-Thomas A. Evans R.J. Pflugers Arch. 2006; 452: 486-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The membrane topology and subunit stoichiometry of P2X receptors are distinct from both the pentameric cysteine loop and tetrameric glutamate families of ligand-gated ion channels. The homomeric and heteromeric assembly of P2X receptor subunits gives rise to a wide range of phenotypes (3North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). The use of knock-out animals, antisense strategies, and subtype-selective antagonists has established the contribution of P2X receptors to a range of physiological processes (5Surprenant A. North R.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 6Khakh B.S. North R.A.

For example, P2X1 receptors mediate contraction of smooth muscles; P2X2 receptors are essential for taste sensation; P2X3 receptors contribute to sensory processing, and P2X4 receptors are involved in pain and blood pressure regulation (for reviews see Refs. 4Roberts J.A. Vial C. Digby H.R. Agboh K.C. Wen H. Atterbury-Thomas A. Evans R.J. Pflugers Arch. 2006; 452: 486-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Surprenant A. North R.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The regulation of these receptors is therefore of interest as it may have important physiological consequences. The activity of P2X receptors is sensitive to modulation by accessory proteins (8Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 9Chaumont S. Compan V. Toulme E. Richler E. Housley G.D. Rassendren F. Khakh B.S. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: ra8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and it is likely that P2X receptors are not randomly inserted into the membrane but may be targeted to form signaling complexes. We have previously shown that P2X1 receptors are expressed in lipid rafts (10Vial C. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30705-30711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Vial C. Fung C.Y. Goodall A.H. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Evans R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These are rich in cholesterol as well as glycosphingolipids and form liquid-ordered microdomains within the liquid-disordered glycerophospholipid bilayer (12Pike L.J. Biochem.

The association of P2X1 receptors with these rafts appears essential for normal function as disruption of the rafts by depletion of membrane cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβ-CD) 3The abbreviations used are: mβ-CDmethyl-β cyclodextrinTM1first transmembrane segmentα-CDα-cyclodextrinTM2second transmembrane segmentPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. or sequestration of cholesterol with filipin reduced P2X1 receptor-mediated currents by ∼90%, and responses are restored following mβ-CD treatment with cholesterol repletion (10Vial C. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30705-30711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of this effect remains to be determined. A limited number of studies have looked at the lipid raft association of other P2X receptors with a focus on P2X3 (14Vacca F. Amadio S. Sancesario G. Bernardi G. Volonté C. J. Neurosci.

In this study, we have systematically compared the lipid raft association of recombinant P2X1-4 receptors under a range of conditions and demonstrate that they are differentially distributed. In addition, we compared the effects of lipid raft disruption, and only P2X1 receptors showed a reduction in responsiveness. This enabled us to use chimeras between P2X1 and P2X2 receptors and point mutants to identify the molecular basis of cholesterol sensitivity for the P2X1 receptor. methyl-β cyclodextrin first transmembrane segment α-cyclodextrin second transmembrane segment phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. P2X1-4 receptors were stably expressed in P2X null HEK293 cells (P2X2-4 cell lines provided by GlaxoSmithKline). Cells were cultured in T175-cm2 tissue flasks and treated with either apyrase (3.2 units/ml, 1 h) (Sigma) or ATP (100 μm, 10 min) (Sigma). Cells were washed with PBS and scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11, and left on ice for 20 min. Alternatively, the cells expressing P2X1-4 subtype receptors were lysed in 2 ml of MBS (25 mm MES and 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) containing Triton X-100 (0.1, 0.3, or 1%). All lysates were subjected to three 20-s bursts of sonication and brought to 45% sucrose by addition of an equal volume of 90% sucrose in MBS and loaded in an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was layered on top of the sample by placing 4 ml of 35% sucrose prepared in MBS (containing 250 mm Na2CO3) and then 4 ml of 5% sucrose (also in MBS/Na2CO3). The gradient was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm on a TH-641 rotor in a Sorvall OTD65B ultracentrifuge (Kendro Laboratory Products Plc, Bishop's Stortford, UK) for 16 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 12 fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top to the bottom of each tube, and Bio-Rad protein assays were performed (Bio-Rad). Samples from fractions 3 to 10 were then equally protein-loaded and run by Western blotting. HEK293 cells expressing P2X1 receptors were cultured in 6-well plates and treated with cholesterol-depleting agents (Sigma) as follows: mβ-CD (10 mm, 1 h, room temperature) or filipin (10 μm, 20 min, room temperature). Cells were also treated with the inactive isomer α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) (10 mm, 1 h). Surface proteins were biotinylated by the addition of 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (sulfo-biotin; Pierce) diluted in PBS (30 min at 4 °C). Excess biotin was quenched with two 20-min (4 °C) washes with 100 mm glycine in PBS. Cells were lysed in 300 μl of buffer H (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (P8340; Sigma)), incubated on ice for 20 min, and cleared by centrifugation (4 °C at 16,000 × g for 10 min). For isolation of biotinylated proteins, 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) was added to 200 μl of supernatant and mixed on a rolling shaker (4 °C, 3 h). The rest of the supernatant was retained to assess total protein for each sample. Beads were washed four times in buffer H, and 30 μl of 2× gel sample loading buffer was added. Protein samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were then processed with the primary anti-P2X1-4 receptor antibodies (1:1000 for P2X1, -3, and -4, 1:500 for P2X2, Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel), anti-flotillin-2 (1:5000, BD Biosciences), anti-LAMP-1 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-β-adaptin (1:1000 BD Biosciences). Protein bands were visualized using an ECL Plus kit and Hyperfilm MP (GE Healthcare). Chimeric receptors between the P2X1 and P2X2 receptor were generated using mega-primer-mediated domain swapping. To generate the mega-primers, the smaller of the two receptor components required for the chimera was amplified by PCR. Forward and reverse primers (Sigma) were designed to encode 25 bp of the region of interest and also a 25-bp overhang corresponding to the desired insertion location within the body of the receptor chimera. Each 50-μl PCR contained 50 ng of template P2X receptor, 250 pmol of each primer, 100 μm dNTPs, and 2.5 units/ml PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Cheshire, UK). PCR parameters included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 60 s; and 72 °C, 60 s) and a final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The product from this first PCR was purified (Qiagen, Sussex, UK), and 1 μl was used as mega-primer for the second PCR whereby the larger of the two receptor components required for the chimera was used as template DNA (50 ng of template, 1 μl mega-primer, 100 μm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase). After initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, DNA fragments were amplified through 16 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 60 s; and 68 °C, 16 min) followed by elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. An aliquot of the reaction was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis whereby a band corresponding to the size of the chimeric gene could be seen. The reaction was treated with Dpn-1 (Agilent) to remove any remaining template DNA and then transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells (Agilent). The sequence of the resulting clones was verified by sequencing using Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory services, Leicester University. Native HEK293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle's Salts (with GlutaMAXTM I, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. A monolayer of cells at 80–90% confluence in a 24-well culture dish was transiently transfected using 0.5 μg of DNA (0.45 μg DNA of targeted receptor and 0.05 μg DNA of GFP) and 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 500 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM1. After 24 h of incubation, cells were plated onto 13-mm No. 1 coverslips for electrophysiological experiments and left to grow in DMEM cell culture medium. Cells were subjected to experiments 24–48 h after transfection. Lipofectamine treatment (30 μl added to a T75 flask and incubated for 24 h) had no effect on the raft association of P2X receptors (supplemental Fig. 2). Chimeric receptors were initially expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and 100 μm ATP was shown to be a maximal concentration of agonist. 4R. C. Allsopp, U. Lalo, and R. J. Evans, unpublished observations. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were made from HEK293 cells using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Membrane currents were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV (corrected for liquid junction potential). Data were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at a sampling interval of 200 μs, and acquired using a Digidata 1200 analog-to-digital converter with pClamp 9.2 acquisition software (Molecular Devices). Microelectrodes were filled with internal solution composed (in mm) of 140 potassium gluconate, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 NaCl (pH 7.3, adjusted with KOH) and had resistances in the range of 3–6 megohms. The bath was continuously perfused with extracellular solution containing (in mm) 150 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH). ATP (100 μm) was applied with a U-tube perfusion system. In experiments with filipin (10 μm for 20 min), α-CD (10 mm for 1 h), and mβ-CD (10 mm for 1 h), cells were pretreated in drug-containing solution before the experiment. Controls for treated cells were performed on the same day; therefore, the comparisons between nontreated and treated cells used cells from the same batch. Electrophysiological data were analyzed with CLAMPFIT (Molecular Devices). Data in the text and graphs are shown as mean ± S.E. from n determinations as indicated and analyzed using the unpaired Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Cholesterol-rich lipid rafts are characterized by the presence of flotillin (20Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cholesterol-rich rafts are buoyant and are present toward the top of the sucrose gradient. HEK293 cells stably expressing P2X1-4 receptors were used to determine whether these receptors were localized in lipid rafts. To characterize the distribution of P2X receptors under resting conditions, in the absence of agonist, cells were pretreated with apyrase (3.2 units/ml, 1 h) to break down any endogenous ATP. For the HEK293 cells used in this study, flotillin was detected in the upper fractions (Fig. 1) that we have previously shown to be enriched with >75% of the cholesterol (10Vial C. Evans R.J. J.

The P2X1 receptor was detected in the same fractions as flotillin as we have shown previously (10Vial C. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30705-30711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A similar distribution and co-localization with flotillin was seen for the P2X2 receptor consistent with its presence in lipid rafts. The P2X3 receptor was predominantly in the lipid raft fractions for 0.1% Triton and in the non-raft fractions when prepared with 0.3 and 1% detergent. In contrast, the P2X4 receptor was co-localized with flotillin in fractions 4–6 consistent with its presence in lipid rafts but was also at high levels in non-raft fractions 7–9 that are characterized by the presence of the non-raft marker β-adaptin (22Jacobs C. Onnockx S. Vandenbroere I. Pirson I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Pagano M. Clynes M.A. Masada N. Ciruela A. Ayling L.J. Wachten S. Cooper D.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C607-C619Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This indicates that P2X4 receptors are expressed both within and outside of lipid rafts. The P2X4 receptor can be trafficked through a lysosomal pathway characterized by the presence of the lysosome-associated membrane protein LAMP-1 (24Qureshi O.S. Paramasivam A. Yu J.C. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3838-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested to determine whether LAMP-1 was associated with lipid rafts. Western blotting showed that LAMP-1 was only detected in the lipid raft fractions (supplemental Fig. 1). The association of receptors with lipid rafts can be changed following ligand binding. This has been reported for several G protein-coupled receptors, e.g. following activation the β2-adrenoreceptor moves out of the lipid rafts and leads to a reduction in signaling (25Rybin V.O. Xu X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 26Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Drenan R.M. Xiang Y. Regan J.W. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42063-42069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Activation of P2X1 and P2X3 receptors results in desensitization, and ∼5 min are required following agonist removal for responses to recover. We therefore tested whether movement out of the lipid rafts could contribute to desensitization. For P2X1-4 receptors, stimulation with ATP (100 μm) had no effect on the receptor distribution (Fig. 1). This demonstrates that in contrast to some G-protein-coupled receptors, the activation of P2X1-4 ligand-gated ion channel receptors does not result in movement out of the lipid rafts. Lipid rafts show heterogeneity based on their protein and lipid content (12Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and differences in detergent solubility can be used to characterize different raft domains as well as the strength of association of a particular protein with the rafts. The use of Na2CO3 MBS (see Fig. 1) gives rise to lipid rafts that are enriched in glycerophospholipids and retain inner leaflet membrane lipids (12Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In contrast, lysis using the detergent Triton X-100 leads to a depletion of glycerophospholipids and disruption of inner leaflet membrane lipids (12Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). We have therefore compared the raft association of P2X1-4 receptors following solubilization in 0.1, 0.3, and 1% Triton X-100. Flotillin was detected in the buoyant fractions 4–5 for Triton X-100 at 1% showing that the core raft is maintained under these conditions. Triton X-100 solubilization resulted in the predominant component of the P2X1 receptor being detected in the non-raft fractions. However, some P2X1 receptors were still detected in the raft fraction at 1% Triton consistent with our previous study (Fig. 2) (10Vial C. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30705-30711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The P2X2 receptor was associated with flotillin for extraction in 0.1 and 0.3% Triton, but when this was increased to 1%, P2X2 moved to the non-raft fractions and was below the limit of detection in the lipid raft fractions (Fig. 2). The P2X3 receptor was predominantly in the lipid raft fractions for 0.1% Triton and was only detected in the non-raft fractions when prepared with 0.3 and 1% detergent (Fig. 2). This contrasts with the localization of P2X3 receptors in lipid rafts following 1% Triton X treatment in cerebellar granule neurons (14Vacca F. Amadio S. Sancesario G. Bernardi G. Volonté C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 76: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and suggests that differences in lipid composition or the repertoire of accessory proteins differs between HEK293 cells and granule cells. The P2X4 receptor showed both raft and non-raft association with 0.1% Triton and no raft association at concentrations of Triton at ≥0.3% (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that P2X1-4 receptors show differential distribution with lipid rafts. The co-localization of P2X1-4 receptors with flotillin clearly shows that these receptors are associated with lipid rafts; however, the extent of the association appears subtype-dependent. To determine whether the lipid rafts play a regulatory role on the P2X1-4 receptor function, we tested the effects of disrupting the lipid rafts either by using filipin (10 μm for 20 min) to form multimeric globular complexes with membrane cholesterol or depleting cholesterol with mβ-CD (10 mm for 1 h). ATP (100 μm) evoked transient inward P2X1 receptor currents as described previously (10Vial C. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30705-30711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Filipin or mβ-CD treatment reduced the peak amplitude of P2X1 receptor currents by >90% (Fig. 3a). The inactive α-CD (10 mm for 1 h) had no effect on P2X1 receptor currents indicating that the effects of mβ-CD result from cholesterol depletion (Fig. 3a). The reduction in P2X1 receptor responses could result from a decrease in agonist sensitivity, surface expression, and/or an effect on channel gating. The time course of ATP-evoked P2X1 receptor currents is concentration-dependent, and the lack of effect of filipin or mβ-CD treatment on the rise time or desensitization of the P2X1 receptor currents (data not shown) indicates that the reduction in current amplitude does not result from a reduction in agonist sensitivity. Cell surface expression of the P2X1 receptor was also unaffected by cholesterol disruption (Fig. 3a, lower panel) demonstrating that a change in receptor number does not account for the inhibition of P2X1 receptor responses. Taken together, these results suggest that cholesterol depletion has an effect on P2X1 receptor channel gating/activation. These results are consistent with our previous work demonstrating the importance of lipid rafts in the regulation of P2X1 receptors (10Vial C. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30705-30711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Vial C. Fung C.Y. Goodall A.H. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Evans R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At P2X2 receptors ATP (an EC50 concentration of 10 μm or a maximal concentration of 100 μm) evoked inward currents that were sustained during the 3 s of application and unaffected by mβ-CD treatment (Fig. 3b and supplemental Fig. 3) demonstrating that the integrity of lipid rafts is not essential for normal P2X receptor-mediated responses. Filipin treatment resulted in an ∼50% increase in current amplitude for the P2X2 receptor (Fig. 3b). The lack of effect of mβ-CD on P2X2 receptors suggests that cholesterol depletion does not affect the P2X2 receptor. Whether the potentiation by filipin could result from its clustering/chelation of cholesterol in the membrane or an effect not related to changes in cholesterol remains to be determined. Rapid transient inward currents were evoked by ATP (100 μm, a maximal concentration) from HEK293 cells expressing P2X3 receptors. The amplitude and time course of these responses were unaffected by filipin or cyclodextrin treatment (Fig. 3c). Similarly, responses to an ∼EC50 concentration of ATP (1 mm) were unaffected by mβ-CD treatment (supplemental Fig. 3). These results are consistent with previous studies on native and recombinant P2X3 receptors (15Liu M. Huang W. Wu D. Priestley J.V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Vacca F. Giustizieri M. Ciotti M.T. Mercuri N.B. Volonté C. J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Filipin treatment had no effect on ATP-evoked P2X4 receptor currents evoked either by an EC50 concentration of ATP (10 μm) or a maximal concentration (100 μm) (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 3), indicating that lipid rafts do not play a role in their basal regulation. However, P2X4 receptor currents were potentiated ∼2.5-fold following treatment with cyclodextrins. The similar enhancement of the response by either mβ-CD, which depletes cholesterol, or the α-CD analog, which has no effect on cholesterol (as well as the lack of effect of filipin), suggests that the potentiation is due to an effect of the cyclodextrin family of compounds and not due to an effect on cholesterol. The level of P2X4 receptor expression and functional currents can be regulated by lysosome trafficking and is potentiated by ionomycin (24Qureshi O.S. Paramasivam A. Yu J.C. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3838-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and methylamine (27Toulme E. Garcia A. Samways D. Egan T.M. Carson M.J. Khakh B.S. J. Gen Physiol. 2010; 135: 333-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that cyclodextrins potentiate P2X4 currents by an effect on receptor trafficking. This study demonstrates that although P2X1-4 receptors are present in lipid rafts, albeit to different extents, only P2X1 receptor currents are sensitive to cholesterol depletion. To address the molecular basis of cholesterol sensitivity, we generated a series of chimeras on a P2X1 receptor background replacing the amino terminus (P2X1-2a), the first transmembrane segment (TM1) (P2X1-2b), the extracellular domain (P2X1-2c), the second transmembrane segment (TM2) (P2X1-2d), or the regions of the carboxyl terminus (P2X1-2eα, residues 354–366 and P2X1-2eβ residues 366 onwards swapped) with the equivalent region from the human P2X2 receptor (Fig. 4a). To determine which regions of the P2X1 receptor contribute to cholesterol sensitivity, the chimeric receptors were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, and the effects of cholesterol depletion with mβ-CD or filipin were determined on the responses to a maximal concentration of ATP (100 μm). Replacement of TM2 (P2X1-2d) or the first half of the carboxyl terminus of the P2X1 receptor (P2X1-2eα) with the P2X2 receptor had no effect on the reduction of the responses following cholesterol depletion (Fig. 4, b and c). Swapping the P2X2 receptor TM1 (P2X1-2b), extracellular domain (P2X1-2c), or second half of the carboxyl terminus (P2X1-2eβ) for the equivalent P2X1 receptor region reduced the effects of cholesterol depletion by ∼20–40% suggesting that these regions contribute to receptor regulation by lipid rafts. However, replacing the amino terminus of the P2X1 receptor with the equivalent region from the P2X2 receptor (P2X1-2a) abolished the inhibitory effect of cholesterol depletion (Fig. 4, b and c). The “mirror” chimera inserting the amino terminus of the P2X1 receptor into the P2X2 receptor (P2X2-1a) was reduced following filipin treatment (145 ± 17 and 23 ±"
https://openalex.org/W1992896042,"The gliotransmitters released from astrocytes are deemed to play key roles in the glial cell-neuron communication for normal function of the brain. The gliotransmitters, such as glutamate, ATP, D-serine, neuropeptide Y, are stored in vesicles of astrocytes and secreted following the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced intracellular Ca2+ releases. Yet studies on the identity of the IP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ stores remain virtually unexplored.We have therefore studied the potential existence of the IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores in the cytoplasm of astrocytes using human brain tissue samples in contrast to cultured astrocytes that had primarily been used in the past. It was thus found that secretory granule marker proteins chromogranins and secretogranin II localize in the large dense core vesicles of astrocytes, thereby confirming the large dense core vesicles as bona fide secretory granules. Moreover, consistent with the major IP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ store role of secretory granules in secretory cells, secretory granules of astrocytes also contained all three (types 1, 2, and 3) IP3R isoforms.Given that the secretory granule marker proteins chromogranins and secretogranin II are high-capacity, low-affinity Ca2+ storage proteins and chromogranins interact with the IP3Rs to activate the IP3R/Ca2+ channels, i.e., increase both the mean open time and the open probability of the channels, these results imply that secretory granules of astrocytes function as the IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store."
https://openalex.org/W2127228076,"Chimpanzee culture has generated intense recent interest, fueled by the technical complexity of chimpanzee tool-using traditions; yet it is seriously doubted whether chimpanzees are able to learn motor procedures by imitation under natural conditions. Here we take advantage of an unusual chimpanzee population as a ‘natural experiment’ to identify evidence for imitative learning of this kind in wild chimpanzees. The Sonso chimpanzee community has suffered from high levels of snare injury and now has several manually disabled members. Adult male Tinka, with near-total paralysis of both hands, compensates inability to scratch his back manually by employing a distinctive technique of holding a growing liana taut while making side-to-side body movements against it. We found that seven able-bodied young chimpanzees also used this ‘liana-scratch’ technique, although they had no need to. The distribution of the liana-scratch technique was statistically associated with individuals' range overlap with Tinka and the extent of time they spent in parties with him, confirming that the technique is acquired by social learning. The motivation for able-bodied chimpanzees copying his variant is unknown, but the fact that they do is evidence that the imitative learning of motor procedures from others is a natural trait of wild chimpanzees."

In this study, in order to determine whether adiponectin affects tumor growth and tumor induced vascularization, we implanted B16F10 melanoma and Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells subcutaneously into adiponectin knockout and wild-type control mice, and found that adiponectin deficiency markedly promoted the growth of both tumors. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that adiponectin deficiency reduced macrophage recruitment to the tumor, but did not affect cancer cell mitosis, apoptosis, or tumor-associated angiogenesis. In addition, treatment with recombinant adiponectin did not affect the proliferation of cultured B16F10 tumor cells. Importantly, the restoration of microphage infiltration at an early stage of tumorigenesis by means of co-injection of B16F10 cells and macrophages reversed the increased tumor growth in adiponectin knockout mice. Thus, we conclude that the enhanced tumor growth observed in adiponectin deficient mice is likely due to the reduction of macrophage infiltration rather than enhanced angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2171275715,"Background Symbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing trees are rare in late-successional temperate forests, even though these forests are often N limited. Two hypotheses could explain this paradox. The ‘phylogenetic constraints hypothesis’ states that no late-successional tree taxa in temperate forests belong to clades that are predisposed to N fixation. Conversely, the ‘selective constraints hypothesis’ states that such taxa are present, but N-fixing symbioses would lower their fitness. Here we test the phylogenetic constraints hypothesis. Methodology/Principal Findings Using U.S. forest inventory data, we derived successional indices related to shade tolerance and stand age for N-fixing trees, non-fixing trees in the ‘potentially N-fixing clade’ (smallest angiosperm clade that includes all N fixers), and non-fixing trees outside this clade. We then used phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) to test for associations between these successional indices and N fixation. Four results stand out from our analysis of U.S. trees. First, N fixers are less shade-tolerant than non-fixers both inside and outside of the potentially N-fixing clade. Second, N fixers tend to occur in younger stands in a given geographical region than non-fixers both inside and outside of the potentially N-fixing clade. Third, the potentially N-fixing clade contains numerous late-successional non-fixers. Fourth, although the N fixation trait is evolutionarily conserved, the successional traits are relatively labile. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that selective constraints, not phylogenetic constraints, explain the rarity of late-successional N-fixing trees in temperate forests. Because N-fixing trees could overcome N limitation to net primary production if they were abundant, this study helps to understand the maintenance of N limitation in temperate forests, and therefore the capacity of this biome to sequester carbon."
https://openalex.org/W1970424863,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critical for physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Within the tumor microenvironment, VEGF functions as an endothelial cell survival factor, permeability factor, mitogen, and chemotactic agent. The majority of these functions are mediated by VEGF-induced activation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a high affinity receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by endothelial cells and other cell types in the tumor microenvironment. VEGF can also ligate other cell surface receptors including VEGFR1 and neuropilin-1 and -2. However, the importance of VEGF-induced activation of these receptors in tumorigenesis is still unclear. We report the development and characterization of r84, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds human and mouse VEGF and selectively blocks VEGF from interacting with VEGFR2 but does not interfere with VEGF∶VEGFR1 interaction. Selective blockade of VEGF binding to VEGFR2 by r84 is shown through ELISA, receptor binding assays, receptor activation assays, and cell-based functional assays. Furthermore, we show that r84 has potent anti-tumor activity and does not alter tissue histology or blood and urine chemistry after chronic high dose therapy in mice. In addition, chronic r84 therapy does not induce elevated blood pressure levels in some models. The ability of r84 to specifically block VEGF∶VEGFR2 binding provides a valuable tool for the characterization of VEGF receptor pathway activation during tumor progression and highlights the utility and safety of selective blockade of VEGF-induced VEGFR2 signaling in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2058779025,"NPRL2, one of the tumor suppressor genes residing in a 120-kb homozygous deletion region of human chromosome band 3p21.3, has a high degree of amino acid sequence homology with the nitrogen permease regulator 2 (NPR2) yeast gene, and mutations of NPRL2 in yeast cells are associated with resistance to cisplatin-mediated cell killing. Previously, we showed that restoration of NPRL2 in NPRL2-negative and cisplatin-resistant cells resensitize lung cancer cells to cisplatin treatment in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we show that sensitization of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to cisplatin by NPRL2 is accomplished through the regulation of key components in the DNA-damage checkpoint pathway. NPRL2 can phosphorylate ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activated by cisplatin and promote downstream γ-H2AX formation in vitro and in vivo, which occurs during apoptosis concurrently with the initial appearance of high-molecular-weight DNA fragments. Moreover, this combination treatment results in higher Chk1 and Chk2 kinase activity than does treatment with cisplatin alone and can activate Chk2 in pleural metastases tumor xenograft in mice. Activated Chk1 and Chk2 increase the expression of cell cycle checkpoint proteins, including Cdc25A and Cdc25C, leading to higher levels of G2/M arrest in tumor cells treated with NPRL2 and cisplatin than in tumor cells treated with cisplatin only. Our results therefore suggest that ectopic expression of NPRL2 activates the DNA damage checkpoint pathway in cisplatin-resistant and NPRL2-negative cells; hence, the combination of NPRL2 and cisplatin can resensitize cisplatin nonresponders to cisplatin treatment through the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, leading to cell arrest in the G2/M phase and induction of apoptosis. The direct implication of this study is that combination treatment with NPRL2 and cisplatin may overcome cisplatin resistance and enhance therapeutic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2015232689,"Background Senescence has been widely detected among mammals, but its importance to fitness in wild populations remains controversial. According to evolutionary theories, senescence occurs at an age when selection is relatively weak, which in mammals can be predicted by adult survival rates. However, a recent analysis of senescence rates found more age-dependent mortalities in natural populations of longer lived mammal species. This has important implications to ageing research and for understanding the ecological relevance of senescence, yet so far these have not been widely appreciated. We re-address this question by comparing the mean and maximum life span of 125 mammal species. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that senescence occurs at a younger age relative to the mean natural life span in longer lived species. Methodology/Principal Findings We show, using phylogenetically-informed generalised least squares models, a significant log-log relationship between mean life span, as calculated from estimates of adult survival for natural populations, and maximum recorded life span among mammals (R2 = 0.57, p<0.0001). This provides further support for a key prediction of evolutionary theories of ageing. The slope of this relationship (0.353±0.052 s.e.m.), however, indicated that mammals with higher survival rates have a mean life span representing a greater fraction of their potential maximum life span: the ratio of maximum to mean life span decreased significantly from >10 in short-lived to ∼1.5 in long-lived mammal species. Conclusions/Significance We interpret the ratio of maximum to mean life span to be an index of the likelihood an individual will experience senescence, which largely determines maximum life span. Our results suggest that senescence occurs at an earlier age relative to the mean life span, and therefore is experienced by more individuals and remains under selection pressure, in long- compared to short-lived mammals. A minimum rate of somatic degradation may ultimately limit the natural life span of mammals. Our results also indicate that senescence and modulating factors like oxidative stress are increasingly important to the fitness of longer lived mammals (and vice versa)."
https://openalex.org/W2018151612,"Background The Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) is an important marine foodfish species in Southeast Asia and Australia. Genetic improvement of this species has been achieved to some extent through selective breeding programs since 1990s. Several genomic tools such as DNA markers, a linkage map, cDNA and BAC libraries have been developed to assist selective breeding. A physical map is still lacking, although it is essential for positional cloning of genes located in quantitative trait loci (QTL) and assembly of whole genome sequences. Methodology/Principal Findings A genome-wide physical map of the Asian seabass was constructed by restriction fingerprinting of 38,208 BAC clones with SNaPshot HICF FPC technique. A total of 30,454 were assembled into 2,865 contigs. The physical length of the assembled contigs summed up to 665 Mb. Analyses of some contigs using different methods demonstrated the reliability of the assembly. Conclusions/Significance The present physical map is the first physical map for Asian seabass. This physical map will facilitate the fine mapping of QTL for economically important traits and the positional cloning of genes located in QTL. It will also be useful for the whole genome sequencing and assembly. Detailed information about BAC-contigs and BAC clones are available upon request."

These unrelated subordinates stand to gain direct fitness through nest inheritance, raising the question of whether their behaviour is adaptively tailored towards maximizing inheritance prospects. Unusually, in this species, a wealth of theory and empirical data allows us to predict how unrelated subordinates should behave. Based on these predictions, here we compare helping in subordinates that are unrelated or related to the dominant wasp across an extensive range of field-based behavioural contexts. We find no differences in foraging effort, defense behaviour, aggression or inheritance rank between unrelated helpers and their related counterparts. Our study provides no evidence, across a number of behavioural scenarios, that the behaviour of unrelated subordinates is adaptively modified to promote direct fitness interests."
https://openalex.org/W2091939702,"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the major component of caveolae, is a 21-24 kDa integral membrane protein that interacts with a number of signaling molecules. By acting as a scaffolding protein, Cav-1 plays crucial roles in the regulation of various physiologic and patho-physiologic processes including oncogenic transformation and tumorigenesis, and tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study we sought to explore the role of Cav-1 in response to DNA damage and the mechanism involved. We found that the level of Cav-1 was up-regulated rapidly in cells treated with ionizing radiation. The up-regulation of Cav-1 following DNA damage occurred only in cells expressing endogenous Cav-1, and was associated with the activation of DNA damage response pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression of Cav-1 protected cells against DNA damage through modulating the activities of both the homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair systems, as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of the Cav-1-targeted siRNA on cell survival, HR frequency, phosphorylation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and nuclear translocation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) following DNA damage, and by the stimulatory effect of the forced expression of Cav-1 on NHEJ frequency.Our results indicate that Cav-1 may play a critical role in sensing genotoxic stress and in orchestrating the response of cells to DNA damage through regulating the important molecules involved in maintaining genomic integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2084253332,"Background Epidemiological studies have shown a J- or U-shaped relation between alcohol and type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD). The underlying mechanisms are not clear. The aim was to examine the association between alcohol intake and diabetes and intermediate CHD risk factors in relation to selected ADH and ALDH gene variants. Methodology/Principal Findings Cross-sectional study including 6,405 Northern European men and women aged 30–60 years from the general population of Copenhagen, Denmark. Data were collected with self-administered questionnaires, a physical examination, a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test, and various blood tests. J shaped associations were observed between alcohol and diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MS), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and total homocysteine. Positive associations were observed with insulin sensitivity and HDL cholesterol, and a negative association with insulin release. Only a few of the selected ADH and ALDH gene variants was observed to have an effect. The ADH1c (rs1693482) fast metabolizing CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)/diabetes compared to the CT and TT genotypes. Significant interactions were observed between alcohol and ADH1b (rs1229984) with respect to LDL and between alcohol and ALDH2 (rs886205) with respect to IGT/diabetes. Conclusions/Significance The selected ADH and ALDH gene variants had only minor effects, and did not seem to markedly modify the health effects of alcohol drinking. The observed statistical significant associations would not be significant, if corrected for multiple testing."

Adolescents' structural constraints (such as their social position and household labor requirements) and needs (such as anonymity in the health encounter) leave them highly vulnerable during their pregnancies and, especially, during the high malaria transmission season.Our study shows that adolescents need to be targeted specifically, prior to their first pregnancy and with measures adapted to their social context, addressing their structural constraints and needs and going beyond standard health promotion campaigns. Unless such specific measures are taken, adolescents' social vulnerability will present a serious bottleneck for the effectiveness of IPTi-SP."
https://openalex.org/W2006300041,"Breast cancer is the second most frequent type of cancer affecting women. We are increasingly aware that changes in mRNA splicing are associated with various characteristics of cancer. The most deadly aspect of cancer is metastasis, the process by which cancer spreads from the primary tumor to distant organs. However, little is known specifically about the involvement of alternative splicing in the formation of macroscopic metastases. Our study investigates transcript isoform changes that characterize tumors of different abilities to form growing metastases.To identify alternative splicing events (ASEs) that are associated with the fully metastatic phenotype in breast cancer, we used Affymetrix Exon Microarrays to profile mRNA isoform variations genome-wide in weakly metastatic (168FARN and 4T07) and highly metastatic (4T1) mammary carcinomas. Statistical analysis identified significant expression changes in 7606 out of 155,994 (4%) exons and in 1725 out of 189,460 (1%) intronic regions, which affect 2623 out of 16,654 (16%) genes. These changes correspond to putative alternative isoforms-several of which are novel-that are differentially expressed between tumors of varying metastatic phenotypes. Gene pathway analysis showed that 1224 of genes expressing alternative isoforms were involved in cell growth, cell interactions, cell proliferation, cell migration and cell death and have been previously linked to cancers and genetic disorders. We chose ten predicted splice variants for RT-PCR validation, eight of which were successfully confirmed (MED24, MFI2, SRRT, CD44, CLK1 and HNRNPH1). These include three novel intron retentions in CD44, a gene in which isoform variations have been previously associated with the metastasis of several cancers.Our findings reveal that various genes are differently spliced and/or expressed in association with the metastatic phenotype of tumor cells. Identification of metastasis-specific isoforms may contribute to the development of improved breast cancer stage identification and targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1990013017,"In eukaryotes, the 40 S ribosomal subunit serves as the platform of initiation factor assembly, to place itself precisely on the AUG start codon. Structural arrangement of the 18 S rRNA determines the overall shape of the 40 S subunit. Here, we present genetic evaluation of yeast 18 S rRNA function using 10 point mutations altering the polysome profile. All the mutants reduce the abundance of the mutant 40 S, making it limiting for translation initiation. Two of the isolated mutations, G875A, altering the core of the platform domain that binds eIF1 and eIF2, and A1193U, changing the h31 loop located below the P-site tRNA(i)(Met), show phenotypes indicating defective regulation of AUG selection. Evidence is provided that these mutations reduce the interaction with the components of the preinitiation complex, thereby inhibiting its function at different steps. These results indicate that the 18 S rRNA mutations impair the integrity of scanning-competent preinitiation complex, thereby altering the 40 S subunit response to stringent AUG selection. Interestingly, nine of the mutations alter the body/platform domains of 18 S rRNA, potentially affecting the bridges to the 60 S subunit, but they do not change the level of 18 S rRNA intermediates. Based on these results, we also discuss the mechanism of the selective degradation of the mutant 40 S subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2137763819,"The chicken is an important agricultural and avian-model species. A survey of gene expression in a range of different tissues will provide a benchmark for understanding expression levels under normal physiological conditions in birds. With expression data for birds being very scant, this benchmark is of particular interest for comparative expression analysis among various terrestrial vertebrates.We carried out a gene expression survey in eight major chicken tissues using whole genome microarrays. A global picture of gene expression is presented for the eight tissues, and tissue specific as well as common gene expression were identified. A Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis showed that tissue-specific genes are enriched with GO terms reflecting the physiological functions of the specific tissue, and housekeeping genes are enriched with GO terms related to essential biological functions. Comparisons of structural genomic features between tissue-specific genes and housekeeping genes show that housekeeping genes are more compact. Specifically, coding sequence and particularly introns are shorter than genes that display more variation in expression between tissues, and in addition intergenic space was also shorter. Meanwhile, housekeeping genes are more likely to co-localize with other abundantly or highly expressed genes on the same chromosomal regions. Furthermore, comparisons of gene expression in a panel of five common tissues between birds, mammals and amphibians showed that the expression patterns across tissues are highly similar for orthologous genes compared to random gene pairs within each pair-wise comparison, indicating a high degree of functional conservation in gene expression among terrestrial vertebrates.The housekeeping genes identified in this study have shorter gene length, shorter coding sequence length, shorter introns, and shorter intergenic regions, there seems to be selection pressure on economy in genes with a wide tissue distribution, i.e. these genes are more compact. A comparative analysis showed that the expression patterns of orthologous genes are conserved in the terrestrial vertebrates during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2120352078,"High throughput screening (HTS) is one of the primary tools used to identify novel enzyme inhibitors. However, its applicability is generally restricted to targets that can either be expressed recombinantly or purified in large quantities.Here, we described a method to use activity-based probes (ABPs) to identify substrates that are sufficiently selective to allow HTS in complex biological samples. Because ABPs label their target enzymes through the formation of a permanent covalent bond, we can correlate labeling of target enzymes in a complex mixture with inhibition of turnover of a substrate in that same mixture. Thus, substrate specificity can be determined and substrates with sufficiently high selectivity for HTS can be identified. In this study, we demonstrate this method by using an ABP for dipeptidyl aminopeptidases to identify (Pro-Arg)2-Rhodamine as a specific substrate for DPAP1 in Plasmodium falciparum lysates and Cathepsin C in rat liver extracts. We then used this substrate to develop highly sensitive HTS assays (Z'>0.8) that are suitable for use in screening large collections of small molecules (i.e >300,000) for inhibitors of these proteases. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to use broad-spectrum ABPs to identify target-specific substrates.We believe that this approach will have value for many enzymatic systems where access to large amounts of active enzyme is problematic."
https://openalex.org/W2057101458,"Background Factors associated with the survival of truth of clinical conclusions in the medical literature are unknown. We hypothesized that publications with a first author having a higher Hirsch' index value (h-I), which quantifies and predicts an individual's scientific research output, should have a longer half-life. Methods and Results 474 original articles concerning cirrhosis or hepatitis published from 1945 to 1999 were selected. The survivals of the main conclusions were updated in 2009. The truth survival was assessed by time-dependent methods (Kaplan Meier method and Cox). A conclusion was considered to be true, obsolete or false when three or more observers out of the six stated it to be so. 284 out of 474 conclusions (60%) were still considered true, 90 (19%) were considered obsolete and 100 (21%) false. The median of the h-I was = 24 (range 1–85). Authors with true conclusions had significantly higher h-I (median = 28) than those with obsolete (h-I = 19; P = 0.002) or false conclusions (h-I = 19; P = 0.01). The factors associated (P<0.0001) with h-I were: scientific life (h-I = 33 for>30 years vs. 16 for<30 years), -methodological quality score (h-I = 36 for high vs. 20 for low scores), and -positive predictive value combining power, ratio of true to not-true relationships and bias (h-I = 33 for high vs. 20 for low values). In multivariate analysis, the risk ratio of h-I was 1.003 (95%CI, 0.994–1.011), and was not significant (P = 0.56). In a subgroup restricted to 111 articles with a negative conclusion, we observed a significant independent prognostic value of h-I (risk ratio = 1.033; 95%CI, 1.008–1.059; P = 0.009). Using an extrapolation of h-I at the time of article publication there was a significant and independent prognostic value of baseline h-I (risk ratio = 0.027; P = 0.0001). Conclusions The present study failed to clearly demonstrate that the h-index of authors was a prognostic factor for truth survival. However the h-index was associated with true conclusions, methodological quality of trials and positive predictive values."
https://openalex.org/W2134148354,"The consequences of plant species loss are rarely assessed in a multi-trophic context and especially effects on life-history traits of organisms at higher trophic levels have remained largely unstudied. We used a grassland biodiversity experiment and measured the effects of two components of plant diversity, plant species richness and the presence of nitrogen-fixing legumes, on several life-history traits of naturally colonizing aphids and their primary and secondary parasitoids in the field. We found that, irrespective of aphid species identity, the proportion of winged aphid morphs decreased with increasing plant species richness, which was correlated with decreasing host plant biomass. Similarly, emergence proportions of parasitoids decreased with increasing plant species richness. Both, emergence proportions and proportions of female parasitoids were lower in plots with legumes, where host plants had increased nitrogen concentrations. This effect of legume presence could indicate that aphids were better defended against parasitoids in high-nitrogen environments. Body mass of emerged individuals of the two most abundant primary parasitoid species was, however, higher in plots with legumes, suggesting that once parasitoids could overcome aphid defenses, they could profit from larger or more nutritious hosts. Our study demonstrates that cascading effects of plant species loss on higher trophic levels such as aphids, parasitoids and secondary parasitoids begin with changed life-history traits of these insects. Thus, life-history traits of organisms at higher trophic levels may be useful indicators of bottom-up effects of plant diversity on the biodiversity of consumers."
https://openalex.org/W1989987918,"Background The transporters for dopamine (DAT) and norepinephrine (NET) are members of the Na+- and Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family SLC6. There is a line of evidence that alternative splicing results in several isoforms of neurotransmitter transporters including NET. However, its relevance to the physiology and pathology of the neurotransmitter reuptake system has not been fully elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings We found novel isoforms of human DAT and NET produced by alternative splicing in human blood cells (DAT) and placenta (NET), both of which lacked the region encoded by exon 6. RT-PCR analyses showed a difference in expression between the full length (FL) and truncated isoforms in the brain and peripheral tissues, suggesting tissue-specific alternative splicing. Heterologous expression of the FL but not truncated isoforms of DAT and NET in COS-7 cells revealed transport activity. However, immunocytochemistry with confocal microscopy and a cell surface biotinylation assay demonstrated that the truncated as well as FL isoform was expressed at least in part in the plasma membrane at the cell surface, although the truncated DAT was distributed to the cell surface slower than FL DAT. A specific antibody to the C-terminus of DAT labeled the variant but not FL DAT, when cells were not treated with Triton for permeabilization, suggesting the C-terminus of the variant to be located extracellulary. Co-expression of the FL isoform with the truncated isoform in COS-7 cells resulted in a reduced uptake of substrates, indicating a dominant negative effect of the variant. Furthermore, an immunoprecipitation assay revealed physical interaction between the FL and truncated isoforms. Conclusions/Significance The unique expression and function and the proposed membrane topology of the variants suggest the importance of isoforms of catecholamine transporters in monoaminergic signaling in the brain and peripheral tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1978434336,"Background Complex but common maternal diseases such as diabetes and obesity contribute to adverse fetal outcomes. Understanding of the mechanisms involved is hampered by difficulty in isolating individual elements of complex maternal states in vivo. We approached this problem in the context of maternal diabetes and sought an approach to expose the developing fetus in vivo to isolated hyperglycemia in the pregnant rat. Methodology and Principal Findings We hypothesized that glucose infused into the arterial supply of one uterine horn would more highly expose fetuses in the ipsilateral versus contralateral uterine horn. To test this, the glucose tracer [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was infused via the left uterine artery. Regional glucose uptake into maternal tissues and fetuses was quantified using positron emission tomography (PET). Upon infusion, FDG accumulation began in the left-sided placentae, subsequently spreading to the fetuses. Over two hours after completion of the infusion, FDG accumulation was significantly greater in left compared to right uterine horn fetuses, favoring the left by 1.9±0.1 and 2.8±0.3 fold under fasted and hyperinsulinemic conditions (p<10−11 n = 32-35 and p<10−12 n = 27–45) respectively. By contrast, centrally administered [3H]-2-deoxyglucose accumulated equally between the fetuses of the two uterine horns. Induction of significant hyperglycemia (103 mg/dL) localized to the left uterine artery was sustained for at least 48 hours while maternal euglycemia was maintained. Conclusions and Significance This approach exposes selected fetuses to localized hyperglycemia in vivo, minimizing exposure of the mother and thus secondary effects. Additionally, a set of less exposed internal control fetuses are maintained for comparison, allowing direct study of the in vivo fetal effects of isolated hyperglycemia. Broadly, this approach can be extended to study a variety of maternal-sided perturbations suspected to directly affect fetal health."
https://openalex.org/W2025078248,"Recent studies have suggested that ribosomal protein S12 modulates 16S rRNA function and susceptibility to 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides. To study whether the non-restrictive K42R mutation in RpsL affects 2-deoxystreptamine susceptibility in Mycobacterium smegmatis, we studied the drug susceptibility pattern of various mutants with genetic alterations in the 16S rRNA decoding A-site in the context of wild-type and mutant protein S12. RpsL K42R substitution was found not to affect the drug resistance pattern associated with mutational alterations in 16S rRNA H44."
https://openalex.org/W2031279243,"Clathrin and clathrin-dependent events are evolutionary conserved although it is believed that there are differences in the requirement for clathrin in yeast and higher vertebrates. Clathrin is a long-lived protein and thus, with clathrin knockdowns only long-term consequences of clathrin depletion can be studied. Here, we characterize the first vertebrate temperature-sensitive clathrin heavy chain mutant as a tool to investigate responses to rapid clathrin inactivation in higher eukaryotes. Although we created this mutant using a clathrin cryo-electron microscopy model and a yeast temperature-sensitive mutant as a guide, the resulting temperature-sensitive clathrin showed an altered phenotype compared to the corresponding yeast temperature-sensitive clathrin. First, it seemed to form stable triskelions at the non-permissive temperature although endocytosis was impaired under these conditions. Secondly, as a likely consequence of the stable triskelions at the non-permissive temperature, clathrin also localized correctly to its target membranes. Thirdly, we did not observe missorting of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase which could indicate that the temperature-sensitive clathrin is still operating at the non-permissive temperature at the Golgi or, that, like in yeast, more than one TGN trafficking pathway exists. Fourthly, in contrast to yeast, actin does not appear to actively compensate in general endocytosis. Thus, there seem to be differences between vertebrates and yeast which can be studied in further detail with this newly created tool."
