https://openalex.org/W2007236469,"Amyloid fibril formation is assumed to be the molecular basis for a variety of diseases of unrelated origin. Despite its fundamental clinical importance, the mechanism of amyloid formation is not fully understood. When we analyzed a variety of short functional fragments from unrelated amyloid-forming proteins, a remarkable occurrence of aromatic residues was observed. The finding of aromatic residues in diverse fragments raises the possibility that pi-pi interactions may play a significant role in the molecular recognition and self-assembly processes that lead to amyloid formation. This is in line with the well-known central role of pi-stacking interactions in self-assembly processes in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry. We speculate that the stacking interactions may provide energetic contribution as well as order and directionality in the self-assembly of amyloid structures. Experimental data regarding amyloid formation and inhibition by short peptide analogs also support our hypothesis. The pi-stacking hypothesis suggests a new approach to understanding the self-assembly mechanism that governs amyloid formation and indicates possible ways to control this process."
https://openalex.org/W2151165961,"Growth factors, hormones, and other regulatory molecules are traditionally required in tissue engineering studies to direct the differentiation of progenitor cells along specific lineages. We demonstrate that mechanical stimulation in vitro, without ligament-selective exogenous growth and differentiation factors, induces the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells from the bone marrow into a ligament cell lineage in preference to alternative paths (i.e., bone or cartilage cell lineages). A bioreactor was designed to permit the controlled application of ligament-like multidimensional mechanical strains (translational and rotational strain) to the undifferentiated cells embedded in a collagen gel. The application of mechanical stress over a period of 21 days up-regulated ligament fibroblast markers, including collagen types I and III and tenascin-C, fostered statistically significant cell alignment and density and resulted in the formation of oriented collagen fibers, all features characteristic of ligament cells. At the same time, no up-regulation of bone or cartilage-specific cell markers was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2165565339,"Axons and their synapses distal to an injury undergo rapid Wallerian degeneration, but axons in the C57BL/WldS mouse are protected. The degenerative and protective mechanisms are unknown. We identified the protective gene, which encodes an N-terminal fragment of ubiquitination factor E4B (Ube4b) fused to nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat), and showed that it confers a dose-dependent block of Wallerian degeneration. Transected distal axons survived for two weeks, and neuromuscular junctions were also protected. Surprisingly, the Wld protein was located predominantly in the nucleus, indicating an indirect protective mechanism. Nmnat enzyme activity, but not NAD+ content, was increased fourfold in WldS tissues. Thus, axon protection is likely to be mediated by altered ubiquitination or pyridine nucleotide metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1981722357,"Glucocorticoids continue to be the major immunomodulatory agents used in clinical medicine today. However, their actions as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs are both beneficial and deleterious. We analyzed the effect of glucocorticoids on the gene expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. DNA microarray analysis combined with quantitative TaqMan PCR and flow cytometry revealed that glucocorticoids induced the expression of chemokine, cytokine, and complement family members as well as of newly discovered innate immune-related genes, including scavenger and Toll-like receptors. In contrast, glucocorticoids repressed the expression of adaptive immune-related genes. Simultaneous inhibitory and stimulatory effects of glucocorticoids were found on inflammatory T helper subsets and apoptosis-related gene clusters. In cells activated by T cell receptor cross-linking, glucocorticoids down-regulated the expression of specific genes that were previously up-regulated in resting cells, suggesting a potential new mechanism by which they exert positive and negative effects. Considering the broad and continuously renewed interest in glucocorticoid therapy, the profiles we describe here will be useful in designing more specific and efficient treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2121018683,"Prolonged exposure of the brain to ethanol is a prerequisite for developing ethanol dependence, but the underlying neural adaptations are unknown. Here we demonstrate that rats subjected to repeated cycles of intoxication and withdrawal develop a marked and long-lasting increase in voluntary ethanol intake. Exposure-induced but not spontaneous alcohol intake is antagonized by acamprosate, a compound clinically effective in human alcoholism. Expression analysis of cingulate cortex and amygdala reveals a set of long-term up-regulated transcripts in this model. These include members of pathways previously implicated in alcohol dependence (glutamatergic, endocannabinoid, and monoaminergic neurotransmission), as well as pathways not previously thought to be involved in this disorder (e.g., members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway). Thus, alternating periods of ethanol intoxication and withdrawal are sufficient to induce an altered functional brain state, which is likely to be encoded by long-term changes in gene expression. These observations may have important implications for how alcoholism is managed clinically. Novel clinically effective treatments may be possible to develop by targeting the products of genes found to be regulated in our model."
https://openalex.org/W2022683869,"Constitutive activation of NF-κB is an emerging hallmark of various types of tumors including breast, colon, pancreatic, ovarian, and melanoma. In melanoma cells, the basal expression of the CXC chemokine, CXCL1, is constitutively up-regulated. This up-regulation can be attributed in part to constitutive activation of NF-κB. Previous studies have shown an elevated basal IκB kinase (IKK) activity in Hs294T melanoma cells, which leads to an increased rate of IκB phosphorylation and degradation. This increase in IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation leads to an ∼19-fold higher nuclear localization of NF-κB. However, the upstream IKK kinase activity is up-regulated by only about 2-fold and cannot account for the observed increase in NF-κB activity. We now demonstrate that NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) is highly expressed in melanoma cells, and IKK-associated NIK activity is enhanced in these cells compared with the normal cells. Kinase-dead NIK blocked constitutive NF-κB or CXCL1 promoter activity in Hs294T melanoma cells, but not in control normal human epidermal melanocytes. Transient overexpression of wild type NIK results in increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), which is inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by PD98059, an inhibitor of p42/44 MAPK. Moreover, the NF-κB promoter activity decreased with overexpression of dominant negative ERK expression constructs, and EMSA analyses further support the hypothesis that ERK acts upstream of NF-κB and regulates the NF-κB DNA binding activity. Taken together, our data implicate involvement of IκB kinase and MAPK signaling cascades in NIK-induced constitutive activation of NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W1597609025,"Pathologic impacts in the brain lead to a widespread activation of microglial cells far beyond the site of injury. Here, we demonstrate that glial Ca2+ waves can trigger responses in microglial cells. We elicited Ca2+ waves in corpus callosum glial cells by electrical stimulation or local adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ejection in acute brain slices. Macroglial cells, but not microglia, were bulk-loaded with Ca2+-sensitive dyes. Using a transgenic animal in which astrocytes were labeled by the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) allowed us to identify the reacting cell populations: the wave activated a Ca2+ response in both astrocytes and non-astrocytic glial cells and spread over hundreds of micrometers even into the adjacent cortical and ventricular cell layers. Regenerative ATP release and subsequent activation of metabotropic purinergic receptors caused the propagation of the glial Ca2+ wave: the wave was blocked by the purinergic receptor antagonist Reactive Blue 2 and was not affected by the gap junction blocker octanol, but enhanced in Ca2+ free saline. To test whether microglial cells respond to the wave, microglial cells were labeled with a dye-coupled lectin and membrane currents were recorded with the patch-clamp technique. When the wave passed by, a current with the characteristics of a purinergic response was activated. Thus, Ca2+ waves in situ are not restricted to astrocytic cells, but broadly activate different glial cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1995921067,"The substantial variations in the responses of cells to the anaphylatoxin C5a and its desarginated form, C5adR74, suggest that more than one type of cell surface receptor for these ligands might exist. However, only a single receptor for C5a and C5adR74, CD88, has been characterized to date. Here we report that the orphan receptor C5L2/gpr77, which shares 35% amino acid identity with CD88, binds C5a with high affinity but has a 10-fold higher affinity for C5adR74 than CD88. C5L2 also has a moderate affinity for anaphylatoxin C3a, but cross-competition studies suggest that C3a binds to a distinct site from C5a. C4a was able to displace C3a, suggesting that C5L2, like the C3a receptor, may have a low binding affinity for this anaphylatoxin. Unlike CD88 and C3a receptor, C5L2 transfected into RBL-2H3 cells does not support degranulation or increases in intracellular [Ca2+] and is not rapidly internalized in response to ligand binding. However, ligation of C5L2 by anaphylatoxin did potentiate the degranulation response to cross-linkage of the high affinity IgE receptor by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. These results suggest that C5L2 is an anaphylatoxin-binding protein with unique ligand binding and signaling properties. The substantial variations in the responses of cells to the anaphylatoxin C5a and its desarginated form, C5adR74, suggest that more than one type of cell surface receptor for these ligands might exist.

These results suggest that C5L2 is an anaphylatoxin-binding protein with unique ligand binding and signaling properties. Complement fragment C5a is a potent chemoattractant and anaphylatoxin that acts on all classes of leukocytes and on many other cell types including endothelial, smooth muscle, kidney, liver, and neuronal cells (1Gallin J.I.

In addition to its proinflammatory effects, C5a has recently been shown to protect cells against toxic insult and to stimulate proliferation in neurons and hepatocytes (3Bhatia M. Saluja A.K.

Muller-Eberhardt H.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1970; 49: 2427-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The dR74 form has a different spectrum of bioactivity to intact C5a; for instance, in human basophils, stimulation by intact C5a causes the release of lipid mediators (e.g. leukotriene C4) and cytokines (e.g. interleukin-4 and interleukin-13), whereas C5adR74 stimulates only cytokine release (8Eglite S. Pluss K. Dahinden C.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2183-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Antagonists can also discriminate between different cell types: a cyclic peptide is 30-fold more potent on human neutrophils than a linear peptide antagonist, but both peptides are equally potent on human umbilical artery macrophages (9Paczkowski N.J. Finch A.M. Whitmore J.B. Short A.J. Wong A.K. Monk P.N. Cain S.A. Fairlie D.P. Taylor S.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Wide variations in antagonist affinity have also been observed in different species, but the sequences of C5a receptor homologs in these species do not suggest an obvious mechanism for these variations (10Cain S.A. Woodruff T.M. Taylor S.M. Fairlie D.P. Sanderson S.D. Monk P.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1571-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the ability of different cell types to discriminate between agonists, antagonists, and intact C5a/C5adR74 has yet to be elucidated as only a single receptor for C5a (CD88), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, has so far been cloned (11Gerard C.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2993-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CD88 is in a G protein-coupled receptor subfamily that contains the receptors for human C3a (C3aR), formyl peptide, and an orphan receptor, C5L2 (also known as gpr77) (13Ohno M. Hirata T. Enomoto M.

Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 86: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). C5L2 transcripts are widespread with expression demonstrated in spleen, testis, brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, ovary, and colon and in granulocytes and dendritic cells but not monocyte-derived macrophages (13Ohno M. Hirata T. Enomoto M. Araki T. Ishimaru H. Takahashi T.A. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Lee D.K. George S.R. Cheng R. Nguyen T. Liu Y. Brown M.

Here we report that C5L2 has high affinity binding sites for both C5a and C5adR74, apparently with a distinct binding site for the related anaphylatoxin C3a. Unlike CD88, C5L2 couples poorly to Gi-like G protein-mediated signaling pathways and does not undergo rapid receptor internalization in response to ligand binding. des-Arg74 human C5a receptor human C3a receptor rat basophilic leukemia acetoxymethyl ester of Fluo3 hemagglutinin 2,4-dinitrophenol linked to human serum albumin immunoglobulin E specific for 2,4-dinitrophenol des-Arg74 human C5a receptor human C3a receptor rat basophilic leukemia acetoxymethyl ester of Fluo3 hemagglutinin 2,4-dinitrophenol linked to human serum albumin immunoglobulin E specific for 2,4-dinitrophenol RBL-2H3 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, which was supplemented with 400 mg/liter G-418 for transfected cells, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The C5L2 cDNA was cloned from a human brain (whole) Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) by PCR using the sense primer 5′-GCGCGCAAGCTT GCCACC ATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGGGAACGATTCTGTCAGCTAC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGGCCCGAATTCCTACACCTCCATCTCCGAGAC-3′.

After authentication by sequencing, the full-length PCR product was digested with EcoRI andHindIII (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and ligated into the expression vector pEE6hCMV.neo (Celltech). The C3aR cDNA, a generous gift of P. Gasque (Cardiff, United Kingdom), was inserted into PEE6hCMV.neo vector at the same site. Stable transfection of RBL-2H3 cells was achieved by electroporation as previously described (15Monk P.N. Barker M.D. Partridge L.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16625-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or C3aR (clone P4B4, a generous gift from P. Gasque) was used to sort the highest 5% of transfected cells on a Becton-Dickinson Vantage flow cytometer in three rounds of cell sorting. C4a was cloned from the same human brain library as C5L2 using the sense primer 5′-CCGCCGGGATCCAACGTGAACTTCCAAAAGGCGA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GCACCTGGTACCCTATTATCGTTGGAGGCCCGCCT-3′; the addedBamHI and KpnI restriction sites are shown respectively in italics. Expression and purification of the recombinant His6-tagged C5a, C5adR74, C3a, and C4a was performed under denaturing conditions as described previously (9Paczkowski N.J. Finch A.M. Whitmore J.B. Short A.J. Wong A.K. Monk P.N. Cain S.A. Fairlie D.P. Taylor S.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). C4a was also expressed and purified under nondenaturing conditions by sonication in the presence of BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen) using the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Cellular activation was measured as the release of β-hexosaminidase from intracellular granules (16Cain S.A. Ratcliffe C.F. Williams D.M. Harris V. Monk P.N. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 245: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The percentage of β-hexosaminidase release was calculated as a percentage of the maximal release (1 μm C5a or C3a for CD88 and C3aR, respectively) or total cellular β-hexosaminidase (C5L2). EC50 and standard error values were obtained by iterative curve fitting using GraphPad Prism 2.0. Alternatively activation was assayed as the increase in intracellular [Ca2+] measured by flow cytometry of RBL cells labeled with the fluorescent indicator Fluo3AM (15Monk P.N. Barker M.D. Partridge L.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16625-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Competition binding assays were performed using 50 pm125I-C5a or125I-C3a (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on adherent C5aR-transfected RBL cells in 96-well microtiter plates at 4 °C as described previously (17Monk P.N. Pease J.E. Marland G. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2922-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Binding curves were generated by incubating adherent cells in microtiter plates (at 55,000/well) with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled C5a and C3a in the presence or absence of 1 μm unlabeled anaphylatoxin. The IC50, standard error values, and linear regression analyses were obtained by using GraphPad Prism 2.0. These were performed as described previously (18Bock D. Martin U. Gartner S. Rheinheimer C. Raffetseder U. Arseniev L. Barker M.D. Monk P.N. Bautsch W. Kohl J. Klos A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1522-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transfected RBL cells were incubated with 100 nm ligand to stimulate receptor internalization, which was determined as the loss of surface receptor using specific monoclonal antibodies for CD88 (clone S5/1, Serotec), C3aR (clone P4B4), and HA tag at 10 μg/ml. A sequence alignment between CD88, C3aR, and C5L2 is shown in Fig. 1. The N termini of CD88 and C5L2 contain several acidic residues that are characteristic of complement fragment receptors and that, for CD88 at least, form a part of the ligand binding site (19Mery L. Boulay F. Eur. J. Haematol. 1993; 51: 2872-2877Google Scholar). Both CD88 and C3aR have been shown to have distinct ligand binding and activation sites (20Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Receptor activation by ligand involves the engagement of charged and uncharged residues on the extracellular faces of the transmembrane helices. For CD88, these include Ile116, Val286, Arg175, Glu199, Arg206, and Asp282 (21Geva A. Lassere T.B. Lichtarge O. Pollitt S.K. Baranski T.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14047-14052Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); C3aR has conserved residues at most analogous positions (Fig. 1). Interestingly C5L2 shares all of these residues except for Asp282, where there is a Glu residue (boxed residues in Fig. 1). Thus C5L2 has a similar acidic ligand-binding N-terminal domain to CD88 and a similar ligand activation domain. C5L2 was cloned from a human brain cDNA library and expressed as a stable transfectant in the rat basophilic leukemia line RBL-2H3. Antibodies against an N-terminal HA peptide, inserted after the initiating methionine of C5L2, was used to select the top 5% of expressing cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting in three rounds of cell sorting. Anti-HA antibody, but not anti-CD88 or anti-C3aR monoclonal antibody, recognized these cells (data not shown). Binding assays were performed using 125I-C5a and 125I-C3a to determine the ligand specificity. The specific binding curve indicates that specific, saturable binding of C5a occurs (Fig.2 a) with a receptor number calculated from the B max value of 39,736 ± 5,993/cell, mean ± S.E., n = 3. C3a also binds specifically (Fig. 2 b) with a similar number of binding sites (25,652 ± 10,237/cell, mean ± S.E., n= 3; not significantly different from the C5a binding site number), but the calculated affinity for C5a was higher than that for C3a. Ligand specificity was investigated further using competition binding analysis, preincubating cells with a number of potential ligands prior to the addition of 125I-C5a or 125I-C3a (TableI). Using 125I-C5a, the IC50 for C5a was similar to that observed with CD88 in RBL cells, but C5L2 had a 10-fold lower IC50 for C5adR74 than CD88 (Table I). In contrast, C3a and C4a were very poor competitors for 125I-C5a binding to both C5L2 and CD88 (Table I). A very different pattern was observed using125I-C3a: C5a, C4a, and C3a all had similar IC50 values for 125I-C3a binding to C5L2 (TableI), whereas C5adR74, a very effective competitor for125I-C5a binding, had no detectable ability to compete for125I-C3a binding (Table I). This pattern is clearly different to that observed for C3aR (Table I) where both C3a and C4a competed much more effectively with 125I-C3a than C5a or C5adR74. These data demonstrate that C5L2 has a high affinity binding site for C5a and C5adR74 and that C3a (and possibly also C4a) is a low affinity ligand for C5L2. It is likely that the binding sites for C5a and C3a on C5L2 are distinct because of the complex pattern of competition between ligands, in particular the complete failure of C5adR74 to compete with125I-C3a. The location of the C3a binding site is, however, unclear as C5L2 does not have the very large second extracellular loop that appears to form the binding site for C3a on C3aR (24Chao T.H. Ember J.A. Wang M. Bayon Y. Hugli T.E. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9721-9728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The binding of C4a to C3aR has been previously observed (25Lienenklaus S. Ames R.S. Tornetta M.A. Sarau H.M. Foley J.J. Crass T. Sohns B. Raffetseder U. Grove M. Holzer A. Klos A. Kohl J. Bautsch W. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2089-2093PubMed Google Scholar), albeit with a larger difference between C3a and C4a affinities than observed here. The relatively high binding activity of the recombinant C4a used here may be due to the production process, which did not include the denaturation/refolding step used for C5a and C3a. Denaturation of C4a in urea during purification appeared to destroy both the C5L2 and C3aR binding activity.Table ICompetition binding analysis of RBL cells transfected with CD88, C3aR, or C5L2Unlabeled ligandReceptor (radioligand)CD88 (125I-C5a)C3aR (125I-C3a)C5L2 (125I-C5a)C5L2 (125I-C3a)−log IC501-aIC50, concentration of unlabeled ligand resulting in 50% of maximal radioligand binding. ± S.E.IC50n1-bn, number of separate experiments performed in triplicate.−log IC50 ± S.E.IC50n−log IC50 ± S.E.IC50n−log IC50 ± S.E.IC50nnmnmnmnmC5a7.72 ± 0.0319.0145.54 ± 0.072,90038.02 ± 0.04**9.5076.53 ± 0.16***2933C5adR746.39 ± 0.0941265.02 ± 0.189,67037.44 ± 0.10***36.53<43C4a5.35 ± 0.094,44046.60 ± 0.0825035.16 ± 0.10ns6,86046.31 ± 0.12ns4854C3a4.64 ± 0.3323,10036.81 ± 0.05155124.64 ± 0.17ns23,20036.72 ± 0.12ns1907Significantly different from human C5a receptor (CD88) (125I-C5a) or human C3a receptor (C3aR) (125I-C3a): ns,p > 5%; **, p < 0.5%; ***,p < 0.005% (t test).1-a IC50, concentration of unlabeled ligand resulting in 50% of maximal radioligand binding.1-b n, number of separate experiments performed in triplicate.

The ligand binding data suggested the possibility that the high affinity of C5L2 for C5adR74 might explain the sensitivity of some cell types to this ligand. We examined this by assessing the ability of C5L2 to activate transfected RBL cells using the degranulation response to ligand binding. The C5L2 ligands (C5a, C4a, C3a, and C5adR74) were not able to support degranulation at concentrations of up to 3 μm (Fig.3 a). In contrast, C5a and C5adR74 (EC50 = 8 and 21 nm, respectively) could activate CD88-transfected RBL cells (Fig.3 b), and C3a (EC50 = 52 nm) but not C4a could activate C3aR-transfected RBL cells (Fig. 3 c). C5L2 also did not increase degranulation even when RBL cells were primed with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm), a treatment that enhances the response to suboptimal stimuli in RBL cells (26Monk P.N. Bingham B.R. Ahmad T.B. Helm B.A. Receptor. 1993; 3: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar), for 10 min prior to the addition of ligand (data not shown) (17Monk P.N. Pease J.E. Marland G. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2922-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The failure of C4a to activate C3aR has been previously reported (25Lienenklaus S. Ames R.S. Tornetta M.A. Sarau H.M. Foley J.J. Crass T. Sohns B. Raffetseder U. Grove M. Holzer A. Klos A. Kohl J. Bautsch W. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2089-2093PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling activity of C5L2 was also assessed as the increase in intracellular Ca2+ using Fluo3AM-labeled RBL cells, an assay previously shown to be 10-fold more sensitive to ligand concentration than degranulation (15Monk P.N. Barker M.D. Partridge L.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16625-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells expressing C5L2 did not respond to 100 nm C5a, C5adR74, C3a, or C4a (Fig. 3 d), whereas RBL cells expressing CD88 responded to C5a and C5adR74 with robust increases in cellular fluorescence (Fig. 3 e), and RBL cells expressing C3aR responded to C3a but not to C4a (Fig.3 f). Identical patterns of activity were observed using 1 μm ligand (data not shown). The absence of intracellular Ca2+ signaling is not due to low receptor number because the receptor expression level for C5L2 (∼40,000/cell) is actually higher than CD88 expression (∼36,000/cell (17Monk P.N. Pease J.E. Marland G. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2922-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). We then examined whether ligand binding to C5L2 could prime RBL cells for a subsequent stimulus through the tyrosine kinase-coupled high affinity IgE receptor, FcεRI. C5L2-transfected RBL cells were incubated with IgEDNP and activated by addition of 100 ng/ml HSA-DNP. Pretreatment for 10 min with 100 nm C5a, C3a, C4a, and C5adR74 caused small but significant increases in the secretory response to HSA-DNP (Fig. 4). Untransfected cells did not show any increased response to HSA-DNP (Fig. 4), and the pretreatment of C5L2-transfected cells with pertussis toxin at a dose that could completely inhibit the degranulatory response to ligation of CD88 (10 ng/ml for 4 h (30Ahamed J. Haribabu B. Ali H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) also inhibited the effects of C5L2 ligands on the HSA-DNP response (Fig. 4). It appears that a low level of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-dependent signal transduction can occur following ligand binding to C5L2. The relatively weak coupling of C5L2 to G protein (probably Gi) is not surprising because C5L2 does not have a sequence corresponding to the DRY motif found in most chemoattractant and chemokine receptors (Fig. 1); CD88 has132DRF, C3aR has DRC, but C5L2 has DLC (Fig. 1). The arginine residue of this motif in particular has been shown to be important in coupling to G proteins; mutation of the analogous residue in formyl peptide receptor inhibits signaling because of uncoupling from G protein (27Prossnitz E.R. Gilbert T.L. Chiang S. Campbell J.J. Qin S. Newman W. Sklar L.A. Ye R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, the third intracellular loop of C5L2 is much shorter than that of CD88 and C3aR (Fig. 1) and lacks Ser/Thr residues that may be protein kinase C phosphorylation sites as well as a conserved basic region (239KTLK in CD88). Mutation of these Ser/Thr residues to Ala in CD88 inhibits signaling but not ligand binding (18Bock D. Martin U. Gartner S. Rheinheimer C. Raffetseder U. Arseniev L. Barker M.D. Monk P.N. Bautsch W. Kohl J. Klos A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1522-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that this loop plays an essential role in G protein coupling. RBL cells are regarded as an excellent model system for the expression of granulocyte chemoattractant receptors (28Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with similar G proteins and other receptor-associated molecules. Platelet-activating factor receptor transfected into RBL cells (29Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) couples primarily to pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins, demonstrating that different types of G proteins are available for stimulus-secretion coupling in the RBL cell line. We conclude therefore that C5L2, despite being expressed at high levels on granulocytes (13Ohno M. Hirata T. Enomoto M. Araki T. Ishimaru H. Takahashi T.A. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), couples only poorly to the normal range of G proteins for a granulocyte chemoattractant receptor. The possibility that C5L2 has additional signaling functions that do not require Gi protein activation cannot be excluded. This might occur, for example, by the receptor phosphorylation-dependent mechanism utilized by C3aR for chemokine production (30Ahamed J. Haribabu B. Ali H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Figure 4Potentiation by C5L2 ligands of the degranulation response to cross-linkage of the high affinity IgE receptor. RBL cells transfected with C5L2 or untransfected control cells were incubated overnight with 1 μg/ml IgEDNP and then treated with buffer or 100 nm C5a, C5adR74, C4a, or C3a for 15 min prior to the addition of the cross-linking agent HSA-DNP at 100 ng/ml. Degranulation was assessed as the secretion of β-hexosaminidase. In some cases cells were pretreated with 10 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PT) for 4 h prior to the addition of C5L2 ligands. Results are shown as a percentage of the release stimulated by 100 ng/ml HSA-DNP in the absence of anaphylatoxin (control = 100) and are means of three to six separate experiments performed in triplicate ± S.E.

Ames R.S. Tornetta M.A. Sarau H.M. Foley J.J. Crass T. Sohns B. Raffetseder U. Grove M. Holzer A. Klos A. Kohl J. Bautsch W. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2089-2093PubMed Google Scholar) when expressed in RBL cells, and so the ability of ligands (100 nm C5a, C5adR74, C4a, and C3a) to stimulate C5L2 internalization was investigated using anti-HA antibody to measure surface expression. None of the C5L2 ligands induced internalization after a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, although 55% of surface CD88 and 75% of surface C3aR internalized after 10 min of treatment by 100 nm C5a/C5adR74 or C3a, respectively (Fig.5). The broad expression pattern and ligand preference of C5L2 initially suggested the possibility that C5L2 may act as a “sink” for excess anaphylatoxin following activation of the complement cascade, analogous to the Duffy and D6 promiscuous chemokine-binding proteins that may function in the buffering and presentation of chemokines (31Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar). As it is not rapidly internalized, C5L2 is unlikely to be involved in anaphylatoxin clearance but might act as a reservoir of cell surface-associated anaphylatoxin to aid chemotaxis or to buffer anaphylatoxin concentrations during an inflammatory response. Alternatively, although internalization and receptor desensitization are not directly correlated, the retention of ligated C5L2 at the cell surface may be involved in prolonging signaling beyond the rapid responses normally stimulated by C5a. In conclusion, we have shown that C5L2 has high affinity binding sites for C5a and C5adR74 and also binds C3a and C4a with a similar affinity to C3aR. However, C5L2 couples poorly to the intracellular signaling and internalization machinery used by other chemoattractant receptors. The functions of this novel anaphylatoxin-binding protein remain to be defined."
https://openalex.org/W2005940304,"We hypothesize that actin polymerization within vascular smooth muscle (VSM) in response to increased intravascular pressure is a novel and previously unrecognized mechanism underlying arterial myogenic behavior. This hypothesis is based on the following observations. 1) Unlike skeletal or cardiac muscle, VSM contains a substantial pool of unpolymerized globular (G) actin whose function is not known. 2) The cytosolic concentration of G-actin is significantly reduced by an elevation in intravascular pressure, demonstrating the dynamic nature of actin within VSM and implying a shift in the F:G equilibrium in favor of F-actin. 3) Agents that inhibit actin polymerization and stabilize the cytoskeleton (cytochalasins and latrunculin) inhibit the development of myogenic tone and decrease the effectiveness of myogenic reactivity. 4) Depolymerization of F-actin with cytochalasin D causes VSM relaxation and increased G-actin content, whereas polymerization of F-actin with jasplakinolide causes VSM contraction and decreased G-actin content. These results are consistent with observations in other cell types in which actin dynamics have been implicated in contractility and/or motility. Actin filament formation in VSM may therefore underlie mechanotransduction and, by providing additional sites for interaction with myosin, enhance force production in response to pressure. Although the mechanism by which actin polymerization is stimulated by pressure is not known, it likely occurs via integrin-mediated activation of signal transduction pathways previously associated with VSM contraction (e.g., PKC activation, Rho A, and tyrosine phosphorylation)."

High levels of intracellular taurine are maintained by a Na+-dependent taurine transporter (TAUT) in the plasma membrane. In view of the immunomodulatory and cytoprotective effects of taurine, a mouse model with a disrupted gene coding for the taurine transporter (taut-/- mice) was generated. These mice show markedly decreased taurine levels in a variety of tissues, a reduced fertility, and loss of vision due to severe retinal degeneration. In particular, the retinal involvement identifies the taurine transporter as an important factor for the development and maintenance of normal retinal functions and morphology."

We used a phage-displayed library of llama single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) to enrich for species that selectively bind to and are internalized by human cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells (HCEC). Two sdAbs (FC5 and FC44) were selected, sequenced, subcloned, and expressed as fusion proteins with c-Myc-His5 tags. Similar to phage-displayed sdAbs, soluble FC5 and FC44 were shown to selectively bind HCEC and to transmigrate across an in vitro human blood-brain barrier (BBB) model. Both FC5 and FC44, in contrast to an unrelated llama sdAb, were also detected in the brain after i.v. injection into mice. These small (approximately 14 kDa) antibodies have characteristics essential for a carrier-vector and can be used to facilitate drug transport across the BBB."
https://openalex.org/W2149958200,"Angiostatin effectively blocks tumor angiogenesis through still poorly understood mechanisms. Given the close association between immune and vascular regulation, we investigated the effects of angiostatin on angiogenesis-associated leukocytes. Angiostatin inhibited the migration of monocytes and, even more markedly, neutrophils. Angiostatin blocked chemotaxis of neutrophils to CXCR2 chemokine receptor agonists (IL-8, MIP-2, and GROalpha), formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, and repressed fMLP-induced mitochondrial activity. Two different angiostatin forms (kringles 1-4 and 1-3) were effective, whereas whole plasminogen had no effect. IL-8, MIP-2, and GROalpha induced intense angiogenic reactions in vivo, but no angiogenic response to these factors was observed in neutropenic mice, demonstrating an essential role for neutrophils. Angiostatin potently inhibited chemokine-induced angiogenesis in vivo, and consistent with in vitro observations, both angiostatin forms were active and whole plasminogen had little effect. Angiostatin inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo was accompanied by a striking reduction in the number of recruited leukocytes. In vivo, the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide also induced extensive leukocyte infiltration and angiogenesis that were blocked by angiostatin. Neutrophils expressed mRNAs for ATP synthase and angiomotin, two known angiostatin receptors. These data show that angiostatin directly inhibits neutrophil migration and neutrophil-mediated angiogenesis and indicate that angiostatin might inhibit inflammation."

In the present study we provide evidence that IFNα and IFNβ induce phosphorylation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein (Map) kinase in CD34+-derived primitive human hematopoietic progenitors. Such type I IFN-inducible phosphorylation of p38 results in activation of the catalytic domain of the kinase and sequential activation of the MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MapKapK-2 kinase), indicating the existence of a signaling cascade, activated downstream of p38 in hematopoietic progenitors. Our data indicate that activation of this signaling cascade by the type I IFN receptor is essential for the generation of the suppressive effects of type I IFNs on normal hematopoiesis. This is shown by studies demonstrating that pharmacological inhibitors of p38 reverse the growth inhibitory effects of IFNα and IFNβ on myeloid (colony-forming granulocytic-macrophage) and eythroid (burst-forming unit-erythroid) progenitor colony formation. In a similar manner, transforming growth factor β, which also exhibits inhibitory effects on normal hematopoiesis, activates p38 and MapKapK-2 in human hematopoietic progenitors, whereas pharmacological inhibitors of p38 reverse its suppressive activities on both myeloid and erythroid colony formation. In further studies, we demonstrate that the primary mechanism by which the p38 Map kinase pathway mediates hematopoietic suppression is regulation of cell cycle progression and is unrelated to induction of apoptosis.

All type I IFNs bind to a common receptor, the type I IFN receptor. The binding of interferons to their common receptor results in activation of two tyrosine kinases of the Janus family, Tyk-2 and Jak-1, that are constitutively associated with the different receptor subunits (reviewed in Refs. 12Darnell J.E.

During engagement of the type I interferon receptor, activated Jak kinases induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat proteins, which results in formation of several different Stat complexes. The IFNα-tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of Stat1 and Stat2 associate with IRF-9 to form the mature interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 complex. This complex translocates to the nucleus of cells and binds to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the promoters of interferon-stimulated genes to initiate gene transcription (12Darnell J.E.

In the present study, we determined whether the p38 Map kinase pathway is engaged in type I IFN signaling in primary human hematopoietic progenitors and whether its function is required for the generation of the suppressive effects of interferons on normal hematopoiesis. Our data demonstrate that p38 and its downstream effector, MapKapK-2, are rapidly activated by IFNα or IFNβ treatment of enriched primary human progenitor cells. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 activation reverses the type I IFN-dependent inhibition of hematopoietic progenitor colony formation, demonstrating that the function of this pathway is essential for the generation of the suppressive effects of type I IFNs on hematopoiesis. We also demonstrate that TGF-β, another potent inhibitor of normal hematopoiesis (27Keller J.R. Sing G.K. Ellingsworth L.R. Ruscetti F.W. J. Cell.

The cells were passed through the columns twice to obtain a purity of 90–95% CD34+ cells, which was confirmed by flow cytometry using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD34 antibodies.

Briefly, cells were treated with IFNα for the indicated times and lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer. Total cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an antibody against MapKap kinase-2, and immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times in phosphorylation lysis buffer and two times in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μmATP) and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of Hsp-25 protein (StressGen Laboratories) and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of Hsp-25 was detected by autoradiography.

The cells were treated with the indicated IFNs and lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer. In some experiments the cells were starved for 2 h prior to interferon treatment.

Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from normal donors after obtaining informed consent, as approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois.

Colony-forming units granulocyte-macrocytic (CFU-GM) and burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) were scored on day 14 of culture. Isolated CD34+ bone marrow cells were grown in IMDM supplemented with 30% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml interleukin-3, 2 IU/ml recombinant human erythropoietin, 20 ng/ml granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, and 50 ng/ml stem cell factor. The cells were exposed to IFNα (1000 units/ml) or TGF-β (20 ng/ml), in the presence or absence of SB203580 (10 μm), as indicated.

We sought to determine whether the p38 Map kinase pathway is activated in response to type I IFN treatment of human hematopoietic progenitors. We initially performed studies with purified human eythroid progenitors, at the CFU-E stage of differentiation. The hematopoietic progenitor cells were incubated for different times in the presence or absence of IFNα, and after cell lysis, total lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated/activated form of p38. As shown in Fig.1, IFNα treatment induced strong phosphorylation of the p38 Map kinase in human progenitors (Fig. 1,A and B). In a similar manner, when progenitor cells were treated with IFNβ, p38 was rapidly phosphorylated (Fig. 1,C and D), strongly suggesting that in addition to IFNα this kinase is involved in signaling for all different type I IFNs in primitive hematopoietic cells. In parallel studies, we determined whether type I IFN treatment induces Erk kinase activation in enriched progenitors. CD34+-derived erythroid progenitors were treated with IFNα; the cells were lysed, and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-phospho-Erk-specific antibody. IFNα treatment induced phosphorylation of Erk2 in primary progenitors (Fig. 1, Eand F), indicating that this member of the Erk family of Map kinases is also engaged in type I IFN signaling in primary hematopoietic cells. Previous studies (36Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) have shown that a downstream effector of p38 is the MapKapK-2 kinase, which is activated in response to stress and growth factors as well as in response to type I IFN treatment of human cell lines (24Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30127-30131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We examined whether IFNα treatment results in activation of this kinase in expanded CD34+ bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells. Lysates from IFNα-treated or untreated cells were immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody against MapKap kinase-2, and in vitrokinase assays were performed on the immunoprecipitates, using Hsp-25 as an exogenous substrate. Fig. 1 G shows that this downstream effector of the p38 Map kinase is activated in an IFNα-dependent manner. Such an activation is detectable after 20 min of IFNα treatment and is very strong after 60 min of incubation with IFNα. Thus, treatment of primary hematopoietic progenitors with IFNα results in phosphorylation and activation of MapKapK-2, indicating that this kinase is a downstream effector of p38 in human hematopoietic progenitors and may participate in the generation of the biological effects of type I IFNs in hematopoietic cells. As our data established that both the p38 and Erk2 are activated in primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells, we sought to obtain information on the role that these Map kinases play in type I IFN-dependent suppression of normal hematopoietic cell progenitor growth. We performed experiments in which bone marrow mononuclear cells were cultured in methylcellulose with IFNα, in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors for the p38 pathway (SB203580 and SB202190) or the Erk pathway (PD98059). As shown in Fig.2 A, addition of SB203580 had no significant effects on normal colony formation for myeloid (CFU-GM) or erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors, suggesting that the p38 pathway does not mediate signals required for growth or differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors (Fig. 2 A). As expected, IFNα inhibited colony formation for both myeloid (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors (Fig. 2, A–C). Concomitant treatment of cells with SB203580, used at doses of either 5 or 10 μm, reve"

These diseases are typified by the Z variant of α1-antitrypsin (E342K), which causes the retention of protein within hepatocytes as inclusion bodies that are associated with neonatal hepatitis and cirrhosis. The inclusion bodies result from the Z mutation perturbing the conformation of the protein, which facilitates a sequential interaction between the reactive center loop of one molecule and β-sheet A of a second. Therapies to prevent liver disease must block this reactive loop-β-sheet polymerization without interfering with other proteins of similar tertiary structure. We have used reactive loop peptides to explore the differences between the pathogenic Z and normal M α1-antitrypsin. The results show that the reactive loop is likely to be partially inserted into β-sheet A in Z α1-antitrypsin. This conformational difference from M α1-antitrypsin was exploited with a 6-mer reactive loop peptide (FLEAIG) that selectively and stably bound Z α1-antitrypsin. The importance of this finding is that the peptide prevented the polymerization of Z α1-antitrypsin and did not significantly anneal to other proteins (such as antithrombin, α1-antichymotrypsin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) with a similar tertiary structure. These findings provide a lead compound for the development of small molecule inhibitors that can be used to treat patients with Z α1-antitrypsin deficiency.

The proteinase binds to the serpin and cleaves the reactive loop at the P1-P1′ bond. This cleavage initiates a profound conformational change in the serpin in which the reactive loop peptide inserts into β-sheet A to form a new central strand termed s4A (6Huntington J.A. Read R.J.

The conformational change inactivates the proteinase by translocating it over 70 Å to the lower pole of the molecule and disrupting the catalytic site.This reactive loop-β-sheet A interaction, while being essential for proteinase inhibition, also renders the serpin vulnerable to conformational disturbances that are associated with disease, the serpinopathies (8Stein P.E.

Point mutations perturb the relationship between the reactive loop and β-sheet A to allow the sequential interaction between the reactive center loop of one molecule and β-sheet A of another (Fig. 1 a). These loop-sheet polymers are inactive as proteinase inhibitors and are retained within the cell of synthesis. This process is best characterized for the deficiency variants of α1-antitrypsin (9Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W.

Most Northern Europeans are M homozygotes, but 1 in 25 has the severe Z α1-antitrypsin deficiency variant (E342K). This is at residue P17 (17 residues proximal to the P1reactive center) at the head of strand 5 of β-sheet A and the base of the mobile reactive loop (Fig. 1). The mutation opens β-sheet A thereby favoring the insertion of the reactive loop of another α1-antitrypsin molecule to form a dimer. This can then extend to form chains of polymers that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver to form inclusion bodies (9Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W.

This has allowed us to first define the pathogenic conformation of Z α1-antitrypsin and then exploit this difference from M α1-antitrypsin to target a 6-mer peptide specifically to Z α1-antitrypsin to prevent polymerization.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe 12-mer P14-3 peptide, corresponding to the reactive loop of antithrombin, was incubated in 100-fold molar excess with 0.1 mg/ml M and Z α1-antitrypsin at 37 °C. The binding of the reactive loop peptide to α1-antitrypsin was monitored on acrylamide/8 m urea gels and by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Native α1-antitrypsin unfolded in the urea and was retarded by the gel. The binary complex of α1-antitrypsin with peptide was stable in 8 murea and hence migrated further into the acrylamide. The peptide annealed at a much slower rate to Z α1-antitrypsin than it did to M α1-antitrypsin (Fig.2, top). Analysis of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence allowed a more detailed assessment of the rate of peptide annealing. The addition of peptide to M α1-antitrypsin resulted in a significant increase in fluorescence as the peptide annealed to β-sheet A, reflecting incorporation of the reactive loop peptide into α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 2, bottom). However, the Z variant accepted the 12-mer reactive loop peptide at less than half of the rate of M α1-antitrypsin (2.6 × 10−5 and 6.0 × 10−5 s−1for Z and M α1-antitrypsin, respectively). There was no change in fluorescence signal from α1-antitrypsin cleaved at the reactive loop with Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase when incubated under the same conditions (data not shown).Figure 2Top, 7.5% (w/v) acrylamide, 8m urea gel showing the comparative rates of insertion of the 12-mer peptide into M and Z α1-antitrypsin.

The Z mutation of α1-antitrypsin readily favors loop-sheet polymerization and therefore must make this region more receptive to the reactive center loop of another molecule (Fig. 1 a). However, our data show that the 12-mer reactive loop peptide anneals to Z α1-antitrypsin at a slower rate than to the nonpolymerogenic M α1-antitrypsin. This can be explained by examining the crystal structure of α1-antitrypsin (26Elliott P.R. Pei X.Y. Dafforn T.R. Lomas D.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which shows that the Z mutation lies at the head of strand 5 of β-sheet A and at the base of the reactive center loop. The positively charged lysine residue in Z α1-antitrypsin must destabilize the upper part of β-sheet A to allow partial insertion of the reactive center loop (Fig. 1 b). This partial loop insertion would explain the slower rate of annealing of full-length reactive loop peptides. It would also explain the rapid conversion to polymers as these are formed by annealing of P8-3 of the reactive loop to the lower part of β-sheet A (12Sivasothy P. Dafforn T.R. Gettins P.G.

The conformation adopted by Z α1-antitrypsin is therefore similar to that produced by annealing a P14-8 7-mer reactive loop peptide to antithrombin, which opens the top of β-sheet A to favor polymerization (33Fitton H.L. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Chang W.-S.W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1059-1063PubMed Google Scholar). It also approximates the conformation seen in our crystal structure of a naturally occurring mutant of α1-antichymotrypsin that also readily forms polymersin vitro and in vivo (34Gooptu B. Hazes B. Chang W.S. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 67-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).The hypothesis that the pathogenic conformation adopted by Z α1-antitrypsin is associated with partial insertion of the reactive loop was tested using a peptide targeted to the lower part of β-sheet A. A 6-mer peptide that was homologous to P7-2of the reactive loop of α1-antitrypsin was obtained from Dr A. Zhou and colleagues (Department of Hematology, University of Cambridge) who were undertaking a separate study on the structural requirements for peptide-β-sheet A blockage (Fig. 1 b). This peptide was able to anneal to Z, but not to M α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 3,top), and resulted in a 60% reduction in its inhibitory activity against bovine α-chymotrypsin (data not shown). Furthermore, the rate of fluorescence increase when the peptide annealed was over 30-fold more rapid with Z α1-antitrypsin than with M α1-antitrypsin: 2.2 × 10−5 and 0.07 × 10−5 s−1 for Z and M α1-antitrypsin, respectively (Fig. 3, middle). The importance of this interaction was highlighted by co-incubation of the 6-mer peptide with Z α1-antitrypsin, which resulted in a complete inhibition of polymerization of Z α1-antitrypsin when incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 3,bottom) and 41 °C (data not shown). It is likely that the peptide also prevented polymerization of Z α1-antitrypsin at peptide:protein ratios of less than 25:1, although accurate values were precluded by limited peptide solubility.Figure 3Top, 7.5% (w/v) acrylamide, 8m urea gel showing the insertion of the 6-mer peptide into Z but not M α1-antitrypsin.

Moreover it had no effect on inhibitory activity of M α1-antitrypsin against bovine α-chymotrypsin or the ability of M α1-antitrypsin to form SDS-stable complexes with trypsin (data not shown). The specificity of the interaction of the 6-mer peptide with Z α1-antitrypsin was underscored by the demonstration that it would not anneal to other members of the serpin superfamily that have the same tertiary structure (α1-antichymotrypsin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, or α-antithrombin) when incubated under physiological conditions (data not shown).The implications of these findings are 2-fold. First, an effective approach to treat the liver disease associated with Z α1-antitrypsin would be to inhibit polymerization of the Z protein and thus prevent the accumulation of the protein within hepatocytes. However, this approach may result in the release of inactive Z α1-antitrypsin and would require intravenous replacement therapy with normal α1-antitrypsin to replenish plasma levels to prevent emphysema. This makes it essential to specifically block β-sheet A of Z α1-antitrypsin but not M α1-antitrypsin or other proteins with a similar tertiary structure. We have shown that this is achievable in vitro. Second, these findings extend to other diseases that result from polymer formation. Loop-sheet polymerization is also recognized to underlie the deficiency of other members of the serpin superfamily: antithrombin (35Bruce D. Perry D.J. Borg J.-Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin.

Lomas DA Nature. 1999; 401: 376-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are associated with thrombosis, angioedema, emphysema, and an inclusion body dementia, respectively. All the mutations that favor these disease processes have been shown, or been predicted, to open β-sheet A and facilitate polymer formation (8Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 38Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Holohan P. Bradshaw C. Feiglin D. Sonderegger P. Kinter J. Becker L.M. Lacbawan F. Kraesnewich M.

Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). It is likely that peptides or synthetic mimetics can be created that will bind specifically to these mutant serpins, prevent polymer formation, and so attenuate disease.In summary, these findings offer the real prospect of selectively targeting Z α1-antitrypsin to prevent polymerization and so ameliorate the associated liver disease. The challenge for the future is to reconcile the requirements of a small molecule for specific inhibition of Z α1-antitrypsin with those properties needed for drug design and targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. Members of the serine proteinase inhibitor or serpin superfamily are characterized by an exposed 14-residue (P14-1) mobile reactive center loop and a dominant five-stranded β-sheet A (1Whisstock J.

The proteinase binds to the serpin and cleaves the reactive loop at the P1-P1′ bond. This cleavage initiates a profound conformational change in the serpin in which the reactive loop peptide inserts into β-sheet A to form a new central strand termed s4A (6Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar,7Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The conformational change inactivates the proteinase by translocating it over 70 Å to the lower pole of the molecule and disrupting the catalytic site. This reactive loop-β-sheet A interaction, while being essential for proteinase inhibition, also renders the serpin vulnerable to conformational disturbances that are associated with disease, the serpinopathies (8Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Point mutations perturb the relationship between the reactive loop and β-sheet A to allow the sequential interaction between the reactive center loop of one molecule and β-sheet A of another (Fig. 1 a). These loop-sheet polymers are inactive as proteinase inhibitors and are retained within the cell of synthesis. This process is best characterized for the deficiency variants of α1-antitrypsin (9Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W.

Most Northern Europeans are M homozygotes, but 1 in 25 has the severe Z α1-antitrypsin deficiency variant (E342K). This is at residue P17 (17 residues proximal to the P1reactive center) at the head of strand 5 of β-sheet A and the base of the mobile reactive loop (Fig. 1). The mutation opens β-sheet A thereby favoring the insertion of the reactive loop of another α1-antitrypsin molecule to form a dimer. This can then extend to form chains of polymers that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver to form inclusion bodies (9Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). These inclusions result in neonatal hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (14Sharp H.L. Bridges R.A. Krivit W.

An effective approach to treatment of the liver disease would be to inhibit polymerization of the Z α1-antitrypsin and thus prevent the accumulation of the protein within hepatocytes.

The conformation adopted by Z α1-antitrypsin is therefore similar to that produced by annealing a P14-8 7-mer reactive loop peptide to antithrombin, which opens the top of β-sheet A to favor polymerization (33Fitton H.L. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Chang W.-S.W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1059-1063PubMed Google Scholar). It also approximates the conformation seen in our crystal structure of a naturally occurring mutant of α1-antichymotrypsin that also readily forms polymersin vitro and in vivo (34Gooptu B. Hazes B.

A 6-mer peptide that was homologous to P7-2of the reactive loop of α1-antitrypsin was obtained from Dr A. Zhou and colleagues (Department of Hematology, University of Cambridge) who were undertaking a separate study on the structural requirements for peptide-β-sheet A blockage (Fig. 1 b). This peptide was able to anneal to Z, but not to M α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 3,top), and resulted in a 60% reduction in its inhibitory activity against bovine α-chymotrypsin (data not shown). Furthermore, the rate of fluorescence increase when the peptide annealed was over 30-fold more rapid with Z α1-antitrypsin than with M α1-antitrypsin: 2.2 × 10−5 and 0.07 × 10−5 s−1 for Z and M α1-antitrypsin, respectively (Fig. 3, middle). The importance of this interaction was highlighted by co-incubation of the 6-mer peptide with Z α1-antitrypsin, which resulted in a complete inhibition of polymerization of Z α1-antitrypsin when incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 3,bottom) and 41 °C (data not shown). It is likely that the peptide also prevented polymerization of Z α1-antitrypsin at peptide:protein ratios of less than 25:1, although accurate values were precluded by limited peptide solubility.Figure 3Top, 7.5% (w/v) acrylamide, 8m urea gel showing the insertion of the 6-mer peptide into Z but not M α1-antitrypsin.

Moreover it had no effect on inhibitory activity of M α1-antitrypsin against bovine α-chymotrypsin or the ability of M α1-antitrypsin to form SDS-stable complexes with trypsin (data not shown). The specificity of the interaction of the 6-mer peptide with Z α1-antitrypsin was underscored by the demonstration that it would not anneal to other members of the serpin superfamily that have the same tertiary structure (α1-antichymotrypsin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, or α-antithrombin) when incubated under physiological conditions (data not shown).The implications of these findings are 2-fold. First, an effective approach to treat the liver disease associated with Z α1-antitrypsin would be to inhibit polymerization of the Z protein and thus prevent the accumulation of the protein within hepatocytes. However, this approach may result in the release of inactive Z α1-antitrypsin and would require intravenous replacement therapy with normal α1-antitrypsin to replenish plasma levels to prevent emphysema. This makes it essential to specifically block β-sheet A of Z α1-antitrypsin but not M α1-antitrypsin or other proteins with a similar tertiary structure. We have shown that this is achievable in vitro. Second, these findings extend to other diseases that result from polymer formation. Loop-sheet polymerization is also recognized to underlie the deficiency of other members of the serpin superfamily: antithrombin (35Bruce D. Perry D.J. Borg J.-Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin.

All the mutations that favor these disease processes have been shown, or been predicted, to open β-sheet A and facilitate polymer formation (8Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct.

It is likely that peptides or synthetic mimetics can be created that will bind specifically to these mutant serpins, prevent polymer formation, and so attenuate disease.In summary, these findings offer the real prospect of selectively targeting Z α1-antitrypsin to prevent polymerization and so ameliorate the associated liver disease. The challenge for the future is to reconcile the requirements of a small molecule for specific inhibition of Z α1-antitrypsin with those properties needed for drug design and targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum. The 12-mer P14-3 peptide, corresponding to the reactive loop of antithrombin, was incubated in 100-fold molar excess with 0.1 mg/ml M and Z α1-antitrypsin at 37 °C. The binding of the reactive loop peptide to α1-antitrypsin was monitored on acrylamide/8 m urea gels and by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Native α1-antitrypsin unfolded in the urea and was retarded by the gel. The binary complex of α1-antitrypsin with peptide was stable in 8 murea and hence migrated further into the acrylamide. The peptide annealed at a much slower rate to Z α1-antitrypsin than it did to M α1-antitrypsin (Fig.2, top). Analysis of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence allowed a more detailed assessment of the rate of peptide annealing. The addition of peptide to M α1-antitrypsin resulted in a significant increase in fluorescence as the peptide annealed to β-sheet A, reflecting incorporation of the reactive loop peptide into α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 2, bottom). However, the Z variant accepted the 12-mer reactive loop peptide at less than half of the rate of M α1-antitrypsin (2.6 × 10−5 and 6.0 × 10−5 s−1for Z and M α1-antitrypsin, respectively). There was no change in fluorescence signal from α1-antitrypsin cleaved at the reactive loop with Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase when incubated under the same conditions (data not shown). Both reactive loop peptide annealing to serpins and the formation of loop-sheet polymers occurs by intramolecular addition of a strand to β-sheet A (12Sivasothy P. Dafforn T.R. Gettins P.G.

Structure. 1998; 15: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 a). The Z mutation of α1-antitrypsin readily favors loop-sheet polymerization and therefore must make this region more receptive to the reactive center loop of another molecule (Fig. 1 a). However, our data show that the 12-mer reactive loop peptide anneals to Z α1-antitrypsin at a slower rate than to the nonpolymerogenic M α1-antitrypsin. This can be explained by examining the crystal structure of α1-antitrypsin (26Elliott P.R. Pei X.Y. Dafforn T.R. Lomas D.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which shows that the Z mutation lies at the head of strand 5 of β-sheet A and at the base of the reactive center loop. The positively charged lysine residue in Z α1-antitrypsin must destabilize the upper part of β-sheet A to allow partial insertion of the reactive center loop (Fig. 1 b). This partial loop insertion would explain the slower rate of annealing of full-length reactive loop peptides. It would also explain the rapid conversion to polymers as these are formed by annealing of P8-3 of the reactive loop to the lower part of β-sheet A (12Sivasothy P. Dafforn T.R. Gettins P.G.

These observations support a 35-year-old conjecture that Mars has a large surface reservoir of solid carbon dioxide.

Therefore, a significant research effort has been made to elucidate the function of Ras in normal and neoplastic cells. In particular, much is now known regarding the function of Ras in signal transduction (3Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 4Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Ras is activated by a diverse spectrum of extracellular stimuli. Once activated, Ras interacts with downstream effectors and stimulates cytoplasmic signaling cascades that regulate events in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Cytoplasmic events include reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and modulation of cell shape and cell movement (5Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Nuclear events include regulation of cell cycle progression and gene transcription (6Pruitt K. Der C.J.

Mutated Ras proteins found in tumors are constitutively activated in the absence of extracellular stimuli, cause persistent signaling, promoting morphologic and growth transformation. Ras interacts with a spectrum of functionally diverse effectors to mediate its diverse functions (3Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 4Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The best characterized are the Raf serine/threonine kinases (8Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Ras binds and promotes the activation of Raf, which in turn activates the MEK1/2 dual specificity kinases, which activate the ERK1mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Activated ERKs then translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and activate Ets family transcription factors. Ras also activates two other MAPK cascades, the JNK and p38 MAPKs, via Raf-independent effectors that activate the Rac small GTPase (9Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar). JNK and p38 activation can also regulate the activity of transcription factors, such as c-Jun and ATF-2, respectively. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases are a second family of effectors involved in Ras transformation (10Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.

Because Ras signaling can regulate the activities of a variety of transcription factors, it is likely that Ras transformation is mediated, in part, by changes in gene expression (7Murphy G.A. Der C.J. Rak J. Oncogene-directed Therapies. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility is the observation that genes with known functions in oncogenesis contain Ras-responsive promoter elements in their promoters (e.g. Ets, AP-1, and NF-κB). For example, the cyclin D1 promoter contains Ets-, AP-1-, and NF-κB-binding sites, and cyclin D1 transcription and protein expression are up-regulated persistently in Ras-transformed cells (6Pruitt K. Der C.J. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and required for Ras oncogenesis (16Yu Q. Geng Y. Sicinski P. Nature. 2001; 411: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Additionally, inhibition of the function of various transcription factors can block Ras transformation of rodent fibroblasts. For example, depletion of c-myc with specific antisense sequences (17Sklar M.D. Thompson E. Welsh M.J. Liebert M. Harney J. Grossman H.B. Smith M. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3699-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or expression of dominant negative mutants of Ets-1, Ets-2 (18Wasylyk C. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B.

Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, the deregulated function of these transcription factors is clearly important for Ras transformation. However, what remains poorly understood is what genes are the key targets of Ras important for transformation. The majority of human cancers in which ras mutations are found are of epithelial or hematopoietic cell origin (1Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 2Clark G.J. Der C.J. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 259-288Google Scholar). Despite this, much of our understanding of Ras function is based on studies of Ras transformation of rodent fibroblast cell lines (23Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Observations that Ras function exhibits significant cell type differences questions whether the delineation of the Ras signaling events important for transformation in rodent fibroblasts accurately reflect how oncogenic Ras promotes human oncogenesis. For example, we and others (24Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,25Schulze A. Lehmann K. Jefferies H.B. McMahon M. Downward J.

Counter, submitted for publication. showed previously that although activated Ras and Raf can fully transform NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, only activated Ras caused transformation of RIE-1, IEC-6, or MCF-10A and HEK human epithelial cells. Although activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is necessary for Ras transformation of RIE-1 cells, by itself, Raf is incapable of causing transformation of these rodent intestinal epithelial cells. Stanbridge and colleagues (26Plattner R. Khosravi-Far R. Sato K.Y. Perucho M. Der C.J. Stanbridge E.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1807-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) found that activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway was necessary for Ras-induced transformation of a human fibrosarcoma but not a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line. Gire et al. (27Gire V. Marshall C.J. Wynford-Thomas D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4819-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) determined that although activated Ras was capable of stimulating a proliferative response in human primary thyroid epithelial cells, activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway alone was not able to mimic this proliferative response. Finally, Marshall and colleagues (28Yip-Schneider M.T. Lin A. Barnard D. Sweeney C.J. Marshall M.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 271-279PubMed Google Scholar) found that up-regulation of the ERK MAPK cascade did not correlate with the presence of mutated ras in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the importance of Raf-independent pathways in the transformation of epithelial cells. To delineate the Raf-independent mechanisms important for Ras transformation of epithelial cells, we utilized the PCR-based cDNA subtraction library screening method of representational difference analysis (RDA) (29Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 30Shields J.M. Powers S. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and we identified genes whose expression was deregulated by activated Ras, but not Raf, in RIE-1 cells. Our analyses identified both known and novel genes that were either up- or down-regulated by Ras, but not Raf, in an essentially all-or-none fashion. These observations support the important role of Raf-independent effectors in causing changes in gene expression and the importance of gain as well as loss of gene expression in Ras-mediated transformation. Finally, we further characterized the regulation of transgelin, which was identified previously as a protein whose expression was lost in suspended or virally transformed rodent cell lines (31Shapland C. Lowings P. Lawson D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We determined that both Raf-dependent and Raf-independent signalings are required for Ras to cause down-regulation of transgelin gene expression in RIE-1 cells, whereas Raf activation alone was sufficient to cause down-regulation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Finally, we determined that Ras-dependent and Ras-independent mechanism can down-regulate transgelin in breast and colon carcinoma cell lines and patient-derived tumors, supporting an important contribution of transgelin loss of function in human oncogenesis. RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells are a spontaneously immortalized, nontransformed, diploid, epidermal growth factor-responsive cell line (obtained from R. J. Coffey, Jr., Vanderbilt University) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Mass populations of RIE-1 cell lines stably expressing activated forms of K-Ras4B (K-Ras(12V)) and Raf-1 (Raf-22W) were established by transfection with pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 retrovirus vectors, where expression of the inserted gene is regulated by a Moloney long terminal repeat promoter, have been characterized previously, and are designated RIE(Ras) and RIE(Raf) cells, respectively (24Oldham S.M.

Mass populations of RIE-1 cells stably expressing constitutively activated forms of RhoA(63L) and Rac1(61L) (32Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kinch M.S. Burridge K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

The MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells, a spontaneously immortalized cell line that retains growth properties of normal breast epithelial cells, were obtained from M. Kinch (Purdue University) and maintained in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 10 μg/ml insulin (35Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar). The MCF-7 human breast ductal carcinoma cell line, provided by E. Stanbridge (University of California, Irvine), was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 8 μg/ml insulin. The T47D human breast ductal carcinomas cell line, provided by P. Keely (University of Wisconsin), was maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 mm sodium pyruvate, and 4 mg/ml insulin. The DLD-1 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line contains one endogenous K-ras(13D) allele, and the derivative cell line of DLD-1 lacking the mutant K-ras allele (DKO-3) (36Shirasawa S. Furuse M.

The reduced ability of the DKO-3 variant to form colonies in soft agar and tumors in athymic nude mice has been described previously (36Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T.

The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line containing one endogenous mutant N-ras(61K) allele and the derivative cell line of HT1080 lacking the mutant ras allele (MCH 603c8) were provided by E. Stanbridge and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 25 mm HEPES, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and additionally for the 603c8 cells, 1× hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium (Sigma) was also added. The human colon tumor cell lines, provided by L. G. Tillotson (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), were as follows: Colo320 HSR and Colo205 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS; HT29, HCT116, and CaCo2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS; and SW480 cells were maintained in Leibovitz's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. RDA was carried out essentially as described by Hubank and Schatz (29Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) and as we have described previously (30Shields J.M. Powers S. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from RIE(Ras) and RIE(Raf) cell lines (24Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that were cultured and harvested at the same time to minimize gene expression changes because of cell culture conditions. mRNA Maxi Kit from Qiagen was used to purify mRNA from total RNA and cDNA prepared with the Superscript Choice Kit (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturers. Tester and driver amplicons were hybridized to each other at molar ratios of 1:100 (DP1), 1:400 (DP2), 1:80,000 (DP3), and 1:800,000 (DP4) for each successive round of RDA. After four rounds of hybridization and PCR, the final PCR products were size-fractionated over a 1.4% agarose gel, purified, cloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript (Stratagene), sequenced, and compared with the GenBankTM and EST data bases using BLAST algorithms. Matched pairs of five colon adenocarcinomas and four breast invasive ductal carcinomas tumor samples along with surrounding marginal nontumor tissue samples were obtained from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center's Tissue Procurement Center at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and total RNA was extracted from the tissues as described below. Total RNA from cultured cells and tumors was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate, acid-phenol method (38Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analyses, 25 μg of total RNA was size-fractionated over 1.4% formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to32P-labeled DNA probes. Control for equivalent RNA loading was determined by hybridization with a GAPDH cDNA probe. Hybridizations were with 2 × 106 cpm/ml in a solution containing 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate at 42 °C for 24–48 h and washed in 1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 50 °C followed by 0.2× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Whereas both activated Ras and Raf can readily transform NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, only Ras can transform RIE-1 and other epithelial cell lines suggesting that Raf-independent pathways play a crucial role in transformation of epithelial cells (24Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To assess further the role of Raf-independent effector function in promoting Ras transformation, we identified genes aberrantly expressed by oncogenic Ras through Raf-independent mechanisms in RIE-1 cells using the PCR-based cDNA subtraction cloning method of RDA (29Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 30Shields J.M. Powers S. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Because our goal was to identify gene expression changes that are important for the maintenance of oncogenic Ras transformation, we utilized RIE-1 cells stably expressing constitutively activated K-Ras4B(12V) or Raf-1 (Raf-22W) (designated RIE(Ras) and RIE(Raf), respectively) (24Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey Jr., R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, the gene expression changes identified may be caused directly by the activation of oncogenic Ras function or indirectly as consequence of Ras-mediated transformation. To isolate genes up-regulated by Ras, but not Raf, we subtracted cDNA from RIE(Ras) cells with cDNA from RIE(Raf) cells. By using this approach, genes up-regulated by the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway were subtracted out leaving only those genes up-regulated by Ras that required activation of Raf-independent effector signaling pathways. To isolate genes down-regulated by Ras, but not Raf, a second subtraction was performed in the reverse direction. Here we subtracted cDNA from RIE(Raf) cells with cDNA from RIE(Ras) cells. In this direction, the absence of cDNA from those genes down-regulated by Ras through Raf-independent pathways allowed for the cloning of the corresponding cDNAs from the RIE(Raf) cells. Fig. 1 shows the difference products (DP) we obtained after four successive rounds of subtraction and amplification used to isolate the genes either up-regulated (Ras cDNA subtracted with Raf cDNA (Ras-Raf), lanes 2–5) or down-regulated (Raf cDNA subtracted with Ras cDNA (Raf-Ras),lanes 6–9) in RIE(Ras) cells. Sequential subtractions resulted in the enrichment of specific bands which represented various genes as we increased the stringency of each subtraction (compare the starting cDNA material, lanes 1 (Ras cDNA representation) and 10 (Raf cDNA representation) to the sequentially subtracted and amplified difference products (DP1 to DP4 for each subtraction, lanes 2–9)). For our analyses, we concentrated on the isolation and analyses of sequences from DP4 to identify those genes whose expression shows a large gain or loss of expression by Ras, but not Raf, activation. We first confirmed that the clones isolated from the subtractions represented truly differentially expressed genes and compared relative expression levels by Northern blot analysis using total RNA from control, empty vector-transfected RIE-1 cells, RIE(Raf), and RIE(Ras) cells hybridized to 32P-labeled probes of each clone (Fig.2). We found that all the isolated clones did correspond to differentially expressed transcripts and most were highly differentially expressed in an essentially all-or-none fashion. Collectively, we identified 10 genes whose expression was up-regulated and 12 whose expression was down-regulated, by Ras but not by Raf or vector only expressing RIE-1 cells. After verification of differential expression, the sequences of the isolated genes were used to search for related sequences in GenBankTM. As summarized in Tables I andII, our analyses identified both known and novel genes. Several genes encoding proteins involved with protein or DNA synthesis were up-regulated by Ras, but not Raf, including DNA-directed RNA polymerase II, IMP dehydrogenase type II, and the L27a ribosomal protein subunit. In addition to four novel genes found to be up-regulated by Ras but not Raf (RDA clones 12, 28, 31, and 87), those encoding a putative ligand-binding protein (RY 2G5), a cartilage matrix proteoglycan (aggrecan), and a serine protease, nexin I (glial-derived nexin I), were also cloned.Table IGenes up-regulated by Ras but not RafRDA cloneSequence identitySpeciesGenBank™ accession no.mRNAIdentitykb%7Potential ligand-binding protein (RY2G5)RatX606602.5998Rat glia-derived nexinRatM177842.610034Rat cartilage proteoglycan (aggrecan)RatJ03485.12.8967.244DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB7RatZ719251.09892IMPDHMouseM33934.13.09346Ribosomal subunit L27aRatX527330.79831EST190268RatAA8007716.99812Novel3.64.928Novel3.287Novel3.7 Open table in a new tab Table IIGenes down-regulated by Ras but not RafCloneSequence identitySpeciesGenBank™ accession no.mRNAIdentitykb%22Homolog of Drosophila pair-rule gene odz/Tenm(ODZ3)MouseAF19518.17.99123TransgelinRatX644221.09924Nidogen/Entactin (ENT)X144802.89141TropomyosinRatM606661.799M6066743Protein tyrosine phosphatase δMouseD139057.79545Stromal cell-derived factor-1 β (β/SDF-1β/TLSF)MouseL120302.9893.647Collagen α-1(I)RatZ78279.14.29875BMP-4Z226071.69717Novel; homologous to human pseudogene for chromogranin BHumanAL035461.13.88315.530Connexin-26RatX510153.59939Novel6.548Novel5.9 Open table in a new tab Genes down-regulated by Ras, but not Raf, included three novel genes (RDA clones 17, 42, and 48), two cytoskeletal actin-binding proteins (tropomyosin and transgelin), an extracellular matrix protein (collagen α-1(I)), a basement membrane protein (nidogen/entactin), a gap junction protein (connexin-26), two membrane-bound receptor proteins (protein tyrosine phosphatase δ and ODZ3), and two growth factor type proteins (bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) and thymic lymphoma cell stimulating factor (TLSF-β/SDF-1β)). One of the genes we identified that was strongly down-regulated by Ras, but not Raf, was transgelin (Fig. 2 B). Transgelin (also called SM22 (39Lawson D. Harrison M. Shapland C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 38: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)) is an actin-binding protein of unknown function and has been shown to cross-link actin filaments in vitro (40Shapland C.

Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Its critical role in regulating salt and fluid transport is underscored by the findings that inactivating mutations in ENaC cause the salt-wasting nephropathy pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, and gain-of-function mutations cause Liddle syndrome, a hereditary form of hypertension (for review, see Ref. 2Lifton R.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Each ENaC subunit is comprised of two transmembrane domains, a large ectodomain flanking them and containing numerousN-linked glycosylation sites, and short intracellular N and C termini (16Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24379-24383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol.

The N termini of α- and γ-ENaC contain conserved Lys residues that serve as ubiquitin acceptor sites (19Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), and the C termini of all three subunits contain the above mentioned PY motifs (4Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T.

Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although all three ENaC chains are glycosylated in cells, the role of this glycosylation is not clear, and indeed mutation of all N-linked glycosylation sites in α-ENaC does not seem to affect channel function (16Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24379-24383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Canessa C.M. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1682-C1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In native tissues, ENaC is a rare protein with very low expression levels (21Loffing J. Pietri L. Aregger F. Bloch-Faure M. Ziegler U. Meneton P. Rossier B.C. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F252-F258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R19-R23Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), permitting electrophysiological and limited immunofluoresence analyses to be performed but precluding biochemical studies on such low abundance proteins. Thus, several groups have investigated aspects of ENaC trafficking and protein stability in cell lines and heterologous expression systems, primarily inXenopus oocytes, Xenopus A6 cells, and mammalian fibroblasts transiently expressing the ENaC subunits (23–26; for review, see Ref. 27Rotin D. Kanelis V. Schild L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F391-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ENaC trafficking in mammalian kidney (polarized) epithelial cells stably expressing αβγ-ENaC has not been reported, hence this was the focus of our studies. The ENaC chains appear to assemble together early on in the endoplasmic reticulum (28Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but details of the route of trafficking to the cell surface are lacking. A major obstacle in following ENaC maturation biochemically has been the lack of an apparent endoglycosidase H (Endo H)-resistant pool, which typically marks mature transmembrane proteins that have acquired complex glycosylation at the medial Golgi compartment. This is unlike the ENaC relative Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide-activated Na channel (FaNaC), in which an Endo H-resistant pool is easily detectable during its maturation process (29Coscoy S. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8317-8322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, an important issue to be resolved is whether ENaC does not acquire complex glycosylation, or whether it does so but the Endo H-resistant pool is below our detection limits. In addition, it has been suggested that in COS cells, the mature ENaC is stripped of its core glycosylation and becomes insoluble in non-ionic detergents upon arrival at the plasma membrane (23Prince L.S. Welsh M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Prince L.S. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1346-C1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous work (19Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the total cellular pool of ENaC expressed heterologously in mammalian MDCK or NIH-3T3 cells has a short half-life (t 1/2 ∼1–2 h), as also shown for A6 cells, which express ENaC endogenously (25Weisz O.A. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30May A. Puoti A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). InXenopus oocytes expressing ectopic ENaC, which are grown at a much lower temperature, this half-life is ∼10 h (31Valentijn J.A. Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30344-30351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Despite the relatively short half-life of the intracellular pool of ENaC in cultured cells, it has been recently suggested that the half-life of the surface pool of ENaC in A6 cells is quite long (>24 h for α or γ, and ∼6 h for the β subunit) (25Weisz O.A. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Kleyman T.R. Zuckerman J.B. Middleton P. McNulty K.A. Hu B. Su X. An B. Eaton D.C. Smith P.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F213-F221Google Scholar). This contrasts previous work which suggested, based on functional studies in Xenopusoocytes after brefeldin A treatment, that the active cell surface pool of ENaC is short lived (10Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 19Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), although this was not tested biochemically. The stability of ENaC at the cell surface of mammalian epithelial cells, most relevant for ENaC function, has not been investigated. In this study, we describe the generation of kidney epithelial MDCK cells stably expressing epitope-tagged αβγ-ENaC under an inducible promoter. Each subunit was tagged with a different tag at the intracellular C terminus, and an additional tag was added to the extracellular domain of β-ENaC. These cells express functional ENaC at the apical membrane. Using this cell line, we show here that the cell surface, mature ENaC is Endo H-sensitive (similar to intracellular ENaC), suggesting that the channel does not acquire complex glycosylation during trafficking to the cell surface. We also show that ENaC is not associated with lipid rafts, and its intracellular and cell surface pools are primarily detergent soluble. Moreover, we demonstrate that unlike A6 cells, the cell surface ENaC has a very short half-life, about 1 h. These studies are important for our understanding of the regulation of channel numbers at the plasma membrane, which play a key role in regulating ENaC function under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, such as Liddle syndrome. MDCK clones expressing rat ENaC chains bearing different epitope tags (see Fig. 1 A) were generated from high resistance MDCK cells as follows. For α-ENaC, a triple HA tag (YPYDVPDY) was introduced intracellularly just upstream of the stop codon, and the cDNA was subcloned into pLKneo, which possesses a dexamethasone-inducible promoter and neomycin resistance gene (32Hirt R.P. Poulain-Godefroy O. Billotte J. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Fasel N. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 111: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After selection in G418, the stably expressing α-ENaC-MDCK cells were used as a template for the introduction of FLAG-tagged γ-ENaC. FLAG-γ-ENaC was generated by introducing an intracellular FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) upstream of the stop codon and subcloning into pCEP4 (Invitrogen), which possesses a hygromycin resistance gene. After selection in hygromycin (in the presence of G418), the αHAγFLAG-ENaC-MDCK cells were used to introduce a double-tagged β-ENaC into them. For β-ENaC, a Myc tag (AEEQKLISEEDL) was inserted in the ectodomain (between amino acids 138 and 139, in a position previously described to have little effect on channel activity (3Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar)), and an intracellular T7 (MASMTGGQQMG) tag was added just upstream of the stop codon. The tagged β-ENaC was subcloned into pBabe-puro, which expresses the puromycin resistance gene, and the cDNA was introduced into the above cells. Puromycin selection (in the presence of G418 and hygromycin) yielded the αHAβMyc,T7γFLAG-ENaC-MDCK cells (see Fig. 1 A). The αβγFLAG-ENaC-MDCK cells have been described previously (19Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10%, fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2-containing humidified air. The αHAβMyc,T7γFLAG-ENaC-MDCK cells were maintained in the above medium supplemented with 300 μg/ml G418, 5 μg/ml puromycin, 100 μg/ml hygromycin, and 10 μm amiloride. To verify protein expression, confluent monolayers grown on 10-cm plates were induced overnight (with 2 mm sodium butyrate, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 10 μm amiloride), washed, and lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 10% glycerol (w/v), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA plus protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; a 250-μg aliquot (for α- or β-ENaC) was boiled in sample buffer, and proteins separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE. Because the expression of the γFLAG was very low, a larger amount of protein (6 mg) was used, and proteins were concentrated by methanol/chloroform precipitation (33Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar) prior to separation on a 7% Tricine SDS-PAGE. For comparison, 600 μg of protein from the αβγFLAG-ENaC-expressing cells was also run on the same gel. After SDS-PAGE separation, proteins were immunoblotted with antibodies to the tags (from Sigma (anti-FLAG), BAbCO (anti-HA), Novagen (anti-T7), PharMingen (anti-Myc)) and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. or SuperSignal from Pierce). In all experiments, MDCK cells were grown either on permeable filters (2.4-cm diameter, 0.4-μm pore size, Costar) or in 3.25-cm wells or 10-cm plates (plastic, Falcon) to confluence, and assays were performed 4 days later to ensure complete polarization and formation of domes (on plates) in the monolayers of cells. Several assays were performed using both systems, with similar results (see “Results”). Whole cell current recordings were made from αHAβMyc,T7γFLAG-ENaC-expressing MDCK cells grown on cover glass using the standard whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique as reported previously (34Ishikawa T. Marunaka Y. Rotin D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used to measure whole cell currents. The amplifier was driven by PCLAMP 6 software to allow the delivery of voltage step protocols with concomitant digitization of the whole cell current. The patch clamp pipettes, which were pulled from glass capillaries (LG 16, Dagan, Minneapolis) using a vertical puller (model PP-830, Narishige, Tokyo), had resistances of ∼2–3 megohms when filled with a standard cesium-glutamate-rich solution described below. The reference was an Ag/AgCl electrode, which was connected to the bath via an agar bridge filled with a standard NaCl-rich bathing solution. Current-voltage (I-V) relations were studied using voltage ramps. The command voltage was varied from −124 mV to +16 mV over a duration of 800 ms every 30 s. 10 μm amiloride-sensitive currents were estimated by subtraction of currents measured under identical conditions except for the addition of 10 μmamiloride. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 100 or 120 cesium-glutamate, 10 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0 or 10 Na2-ATP, and 10 EGTA. The pH of the solution was adjusted with CsOH to 7.4. The cells were initially immersed in a bath solution (pH 7.4) containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4.3 KCl, 1MgCl2, and 10 HEPES. Before the establishment of whole cell configuration, the bath solution was changed to the one containing (in mm) 145 lithium-glutamate, 1 MgCl2, and 19 HEPES. The pH of the solution was adjusted with LiOH. All experiments were performed at room temperature (∼20 °C). Bath solution changes were accomplished by gravity feed from reservoirs. The results are reported as the means ± S.E. of several experiments (n), and n refers to the number of cells patched in the different plate. Confluent monolayers grown on either a permeable filter or a solid support were induced overnight and then kept on ice throughout the experiment. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS-CM (PBS with 1 mm MgCl2and 0.1 mm CaCl2) and incubated 15 min with 1.0 mg/ml EZ-linkTM Sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin (Pierce) in cold biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 9.0) with gentle agitation. Cells were washed once with quenching buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris in PBS-CM) and incubated for 10 min with quenching buffer with light agitation. Cells were then rinsed twice with PBS-CM, scraped in cold PBS, and pelleted at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C. They were lysed in lysis buffer and incubated on ice 30 min before centrifugation (10 min at 14,000 × g, 4 °C). Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and after the addition of 50 μl of 50% slurry of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma), were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation and aliquots of the supernatant were taken to represent the unbound, intracellular pool. Beads were then washed three times with HNTG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Trtion X-100). Biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as above. In some experiments, cells were surface biotinylated by treating with prechilled 10 mm sodium periodate on ice for 30 min in the dark. Cells were then incubated with 1.0 mg/ml EZ-linkTM biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce) in prechilled 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, on ice with slight agitation for 30 min. For all experiments analyzing cell surface expression using the Sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin for surface biotinylation, to ensure the absence of leakage of biotin into the cell (which could label the large intracellular pool of ENaC thus skewing the results), an internal control was used for each plate/well of cells by measuring surface biotinylation of an intracellular protein (e.g. actin, annexin II, enolase). Only plates/wells showing no labeling of intracellular proteins (i.e. no leakage of biotin) were included in our data analysis. Cells were grown on plates and induced overnight prior to experiments. Plates were surface biotinylated and lysed, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated and eluted as described above. Aliquots of supernatant from the streptavidin-agarose bead incubations, representing the intracellular pool of proteins, were boiled in sample buffer. Samples were then either left untreated or were treated with 100 mU Endo H or 15 mU peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF), according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Cells were grown on plates or filters and induced overnight. The following day, the indicated plates/filters were incubated with fresh induction medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (ICN) for 1–6 h at 37 °C. We used one 10-cm plate or six filters (pooled) for each time point. At each time point, the appropriate plates/filters were placed on ice, surface biotinylated, and lysed in lysis buffer as described above. Lysates for each time point were quantitated using the Bio-Rad assay, and total protein was normalized before addition of streptavidin-agarose beads. Lysates were then rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation to pellet the beads, aliquots were taken to represent the unbound, intracellular pool. Beads were washed three times with HNTG, and proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with antibodies to the tags followed by chemiluminescence detection. Band quantitation was then performed using Fluorchem™ equipment and software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Bands were quantified using spot densitometry, where only density values within the linear range were used. Polarized αHAβMyc,T7γFLAG-ENaC-expressing MDCK cells grown on filters or plates were induced overnight and placed on ice. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS-CM, surface biotinylated, and quenched as described above, then scraped in PBS. Cells were pelleted and lysed in lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and pellets (detergent-insoluble fraction) were resuspended in a volume of lysis buffer equal to the supernatants (detergent-soluble fractions). Re- suspended pellets were sonicated three times for 15 s each on ice to solubilize the insoluble fraction (35Adair-Kirk T.L. Cox K.H. Cox J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1237-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatants (representing the insoluble fraction) were collected. For ENaC at the cell surface, biotinylated proteins were precipitated with 50 μl of 50% streptavidin-agarose bead slurry by rotating for 2 h at 4 °C. After brief centrifugation, aliquots of supernatants were taken to represent the intracellular pool and were boiled in sample buffer. Beads were washed, and biotinylated proteins were eluted from the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions as de- scribed above. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting and quantitation of chemiluminescence, as described above. Confluent monolayers grown on permeable filters or solid support (six multiwell plates) were washed three times with PBS, scraped in PBS, and pelleted at 2,000 rpm, 4 °C. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of TN (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% sucrose, and 1% Triton X-100) on ice and incubated for 30 min on ice. For some experiments, cells were surface biotinylated as described above prior to lysis in TN. Samples were mixed with 0.4 ml of cold OptiprepTM, transferred into SW60 centrifuge tubes, and overlaid with 0.6 ml of each 35, 30, 25, 20, and 0% Optiprep in TN, as described by Oliferenko et al. (36Oliferenko S. Paiha K. Harder T. Gerke V. Schwarzler C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Gunthert U. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The gradients were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in an SW60 rotor for 12 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the centrifuge tubes, and proteins were methanol/chloroform precipitated. After resuspension of the pellets in equal volumes of 5% SDS, sample buffer was added, and the fractions were boiled. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Antibodies to annexin II and caveolin were from Santa Cruz and for the tranferrin receptor (TfnR) from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Proteins in the top two fractions (20 and 25%) are considered to be raft-associated (36Oliferenko S. Paiha K. Harder T. Gerke V. Schwarzler C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Gunthert U. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). For experiments in which cells were first surface biotinylated, 50 μl of 50% streptavidin-agarose bead slurry was added to each sample after resuspension of the pellets and rotated for 2 h at room temperature. After brief centrifugation, supernatants were used as described above, and beads were washed three times with HNTG. Biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer supplemented with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Confluent, filter-grown αHAβMyc,T7γFLAG-ENaC-expressing MDCK cells were induced overnight and rinsed three times with cold PBS-CM. Immunogold surface labeling was performed by incubating monolayers on ice for 3 h with monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies in PBS-CM (1:10, PharMingen) in both the apical and basal compartments (4 °C). Cells were washed three times (5 min each) with cold PBS-CM and incubated with goat anti-mouse 15 nm gold in PBS-CM (1:12, British Biolabs) at 4 °C for 1 h on ice. Cells were rinsed three times (5 min each) with ice-cold PBS and incubated in Karnovsky's fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 3.2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with 1% OsO4 for 15 min in the dark. Following PBS washes, filters were incubated with 2% uranyl acetate for 15 min in the dark. Samples were then washed x3 with distilled water and dehydrated using ethanol incubations in 50, 70, 95, and 100% ethanol (2 times 5 min each). Filters were infiltrated with Epon resin:ethanol (1:1 then 3:1, 30 min each) followed by 100% Epon overnight, 4 °C. Fresh Epon was applied to filters and incubated at room temperature for 5 h. Epon was again replaced and polymerized for 48 h at 65 °C. Blocks containing filter were sectioned (90-nm thick- ness) and placed on slotted grids. Sections were viewed using a Hitachi H600 transmission electron microscope. The expression of the ENaC protein in native kidney epithelia is very low, thus precluding biochemical analyses of the channel in these tissues. To analyze ENaC function in cultured kidney epithelial cells, we utilized high resistance MDCK cells, which form polarized monolayers and which are well characterized with respect to cellular trafficking (37Bacallao R. Antony C. Dotti C. Karsenti E. Stelzer E.H. Simons K. J. Cell B"
https://openalex.org/W2124163811,"Human biliverdin reductase (hBVR) is a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes reduction of the heme oxygenase (HO) activity product, biliverdin, to bilirubin. A domain of biliverdin reductase (BVR) has primary structural features that resemble leucine zipper proteins. A heptad repeat of five leucines (L1–L5), a basic domain, and a conserved alanine characterize the domain. In hBVR, a lysine replaces L3. The secondary structure model of hBVR predicts an α-helix-turn-β-sheet for this domain. hBVR translated by the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system appears on a nondenaturing gel as a single band with molecular mass of ∼69 kDa. The protein on a denaturing gel separates into two anti-hBVR immunoreactive proteins of ∼39.9 + 34.6 kDa. The dimeric form, but not purified hBVR, binds to a 100-mer DNA fragment corresponding to the mouse HO-1 (hsp32) promoter region encompassing two activator protein (AP-1) sites. The specificity of DNA binding is suggested by the following: (a) hBVR does not bind to the same DNA fragment with one or zero AP-1 sites; (b) a 56-bp random DNA with one AP-1 site does not form a complex with hBVR; (c) in vitro translated HO-1 does not interact with the 100-mer DNA fragment with two AP-1 sites; (d) mutation of Lys143, Leu150, or Leu157 blocks both the formation of the ∼69-kDa specimens and hBVR DNA complex formation; and (e) purified preparations of hBVR or hHO-1 do not bind to DNA with two AP-1 sites. The potential significance of the AP-1 binding is suggested by the finding that the response of HO-1, in COS cells stably transfected with antisense hBVR, with 66% reduced BVR activity, to superoxide anion ( O2⨪) formed by menadione is attenuated, whereas induction by heme is not affected. We propose a role for BVR in the signaling cascade for AP-1 complex activation necessary for HO-1 oxidative stress response. Human biliverdin reductase (hBVR) is a serine/threonine kinase that catalyzes reduction of the heme oxygenase (HO) activity product, biliverdin, to bilirubin. A domain of biliverdin reductase (BVR) has primary structural features that resemble leucine zipper proteins. A heptad repeat of five leucines (L1–L5), a basic domain, and a conserved alanine characterize the domain. In hBVR, a lysine replaces L3. The secondary structure model of hBVR predicts an α-helix-turn-β-sheet for this domain. hBVR translated by the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system appears on a nondenaturing gel as a single band with molecular mass of ∼69 kDa. The protein on a denaturing gel separates into two anti-hBVR immunoreactive proteins of ∼39.9 + 34.6 kDa. The dimeric form, but not purified hBVR, binds to a 100-mer DNA fragment corresponding to the mouse HO-1 (hsp32) promoter region encompassing two activator protein (AP-1) sites. The specificity of DNA binding is suggested by the following: (a) hBVR does not bind to the same DNA fragment with one or zero AP-1 sites; (b) a 56-bp random DNA with one AP-1 site does not form a complex with hBVR; (c) in vitro translated HO-1 does not interact with the 100-mer DNA fragment with two AP-1 sites; (d) mutation of Lys143, Leu150, or Leu157 blocks both the formation of the ∼69-kDa specimens and hBVR DNA complex formation; and (e) purified preparations of hBVR or hHO-1 do not bind to DNA with two AP-1 sites. The potential significance of the AP-1 binding is suggested by the finding that the response of HO-1, in COS cells stably transfected with antisense hBVR, with 66% reduced BVR activity, to superoxide anion ( O2⨪) formed by menadione is attenuated, whereas induction by heme is not affected. We propose a role for BVR in the signaling cascade for AP-1 complex activation necessary for HO-1 oxidative stress response. biliverdin reductase heme oxygenase human BVR activator protein menadione Biliverdin reductase (BVR)1 is a recently described serine/threonine kinase (1Salim M. Brown-Kipphut B.A. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10929-10934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that catalyzes reduction of biliverdin IXα at the γ meso bridge to produce bilirubin. Biliverdin is the product of heme (Fe-protoporphyrin IX) oxidation by the heme oxygenase (HO) system. The reductase in response to extracellular stimuli (e.g. cGMP, lipopolysaccharides, and free radicals) translocates into the nucleus (2Maines M.D. Ewing J.F. Huang T.J. Panahian N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 1091-1097PubMed Google Scholar) and is activated by oxygen radicals (1Salim M. Brown-Kipphut B.A. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10929-10934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The mammalian enzyme is highly conserved; the rat and human reductases share 84% amino acid identity (3Fakhrai H. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4023-4029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Maines M.D. Polevoda B.V. Huang T.J. McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Certain features of the reductase are conserved phylogenetically from cyanobacteria to humans including its unique property among all enzymes characterized to date of having dual pH/cofactor requirement (5Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schluchter W.M. Glazer A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13562-13569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Human BVR (hBVR) is a 296-residue-long polypeptide that, based on its predicted amino acid sequence, has a region with certain key residues that are conserved in proteins that have a leucine zipper dimerization domain, such as human Shaker, human c-Myc, SaccharomycesGCN4, human c-Jun, human CREB, human c-Fos, andSaccharomyces YAP-1 (Fig. 1). This motif is also found in the rat enzyme (Fig. 1). As a rule, the leucine zipper motif consists of repeat of five leucines (L1–L5) separated by six amino acids (Fig. 1) (7Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar, 8Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Exceptions to this, however, are found, for instance in Saccharomyces YAP-1: L3is substituted with asparagine; in Saccharomyces GCN4 and human CREB, L5 is substituted by araginine and lysine, respectively; and, in human c-Myc, valine replaces L1. They all form functional homodimers or heterodimers. In hBVR and rat BVR, L3 is substituted with lysine at positions 143 and 142, respectively (Fig. 1). Other structural features of the dimerization domain include a secondary structure that in most cases fits the helix-turn-helix model (8Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 9O'Shea E. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 10Struhl K.

The basic region is the DNA binding domain (7Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar, 8Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B.

An α/β secondary structure with leucine-rich repeats also forms a high affinity protein-protein interaction domain (12Kobe B. Diesenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 13Kobe B. Diesenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Although the leucine zipper dimerization motif has been identified in several nonnuclear proteins (Fig. 1), the greater numbers of proteins that have these conserved features are transacting factors and play a role in regulation of gene expression.The AP-1 site is one of the DNA recognition sequences for leucine zipper proteins. The heme oxygenase cognate, HO-1 or hsp32 (14Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Kutty R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is activated by increased AP-1 DNA binding in response to certain oxidative stress stimuli (15Lee P.J. Camhi S.L. Chin B.Y. Alam J. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L175-L182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16He C.H. Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M.K. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation involves binding of c-Jun and c-Fos homodimers or heterodimers to the AP-1 site (17Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar, 18Han Z. Boyle D.L. Chang L. Bennett B. Karin M. Yang L. Manning A.M. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Increased AP-1 complex formation is not restricted to HO-1 or oxidative stress; rather, it is identified for activation of several oncogenes and kinases in response to cytokines, growth factors, transformation factors, UV radiation, and other assorted stimuli (19Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar).Using the x-ray diffraction analysis of rat BVR (20Kikuchi A. Park S.Y. Miyatake H.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we have identified conserved features of leucine zipper DNA-binding proteins in the reductase. We have questioned whether hBVR recognizes specific sequences of DNA and, if so, whether this binding is of biological significance. We present data that show specific binding of native hBVR to DNA and suggest a role for BVR in regulation of HO-1 oxidative stress response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll of the chemicals and biochemicals used in this study were of ultrapure quality purchased from Sigma, Aldrich, or Invitrogen. Enzymes used in this study (BamHI, BlpI,HindIII, SalI, SmaI, XhoI, T4 DNA ligase, DNA polymerase, and polynucleotide kinase) were purchased from New England Biolabs, Invitrogen, or Amersham Biosciences, Inc. [35S]methionine and [32P]ATP RedivueTM radioisotopes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. We used RedivueTMl-[35S]methionine (catalog no. AG 1094), because this grade of [35S]methionine does not cause the background labeling of the rabbit reticulocyte lysate 42-kDa protein that can occur using other grades of labels (21Jackson R. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar).MethodsIn Vitro Synthesis of Capped RNA TranscriptThe full-length BVR fragment was amplified from the plasmid 494 Gex3 (4Maines M.D. Polevoda B.V. Huang T.J. McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides OL.507 and OL.508, while HO-1 (22Yoshida T. Biro P. Cohen T. Müller R.M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 71: 457-464Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar) was amplified using oligonucleotides OL.547 and OL.548 (Table I). They were inserted in the multiple cloning site of pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) betweenBamHI and XhoI. The resultant recombinant DNAs were named as p507 and p547. Methods used in the construction of plasmids, including restriction enzyme digestion, separation of plasmid DNA and restriction fragments on agarose gels, ligation of DNA fragments, and the isolation of plasmid DNA are described in Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Escherichia coli transformations were performed with CaCl2 (24Cohen S.N. Chang A.C.Y. Hsu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out as described by Saiki et al. (25Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlicj H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13400) Google Scholar). Both plasmid p507 and p547 were transformed in INV-competent cells. The plasmid purification was done with Qiagen Mini Prep plasmid purification kit and was linearized by digesting with SmaI. Linearized plasmid was then treated with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and ethanol-precipitated. Plasmids were dissolved and stored in RNase-free water. RNA was transcribed by using the RiboProbein vitro Transcription System from Promega. 5 μg of linearized template DNA was used in a 50-μl reaction volume using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the m7G cap analog so as to generate the capped transcript. 50 units of ribonuclease inhibitor were also added to the reaction along with required amounts of dithiothreitol and nucleotides. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was treated with RNase-free DNase (1 μl/μg of template DNA) and was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with ethanol and ammonium acetate, and resuspended in 20 μl of RNase-free water and kept at −70 °C.Table IList of oligonucleotidesOligonucleotide numberSequenceOL.507GGATCCATGAATGCAGAGCCCGAGAGOL.508CTCGAGAGCTACATCACCTCCTCCTCOL.547GGATCCATGGAGCGCCCACAGCTCGOL.548GCTCGAGTGGCGAAGGATCACCATCGCAGGAGCGGTGTOL.582GAAAAAAGAAGTGGTGGGGGCTGACCTGCTGAAAGGGTCGOL.583CGACCCTTTCAGCAGGTCAGCCCCCACCACTTCTTTTTTCOL.584GACCTGCTGAAAGGGTCGGCCCTCTTCACATCTGACCCGOL.585CGGGTCAGATGTGAAGAGGGCCGACCCTTTCAGCAGGTCOL.586CCTCTTCACATCTGACCCGGCTGAAGAAGACCGGTTTGGCTOL.587AGCCAAACCGGTCTTCTTCAGCCGGGTCAGATGTGAAGAGGOL.619TCCTCAGCTGCTTTTATGCTGTGTCATGGTTGGGAGGGGTGATTAGCAGACAAAGGGAAGACAGATTTTGCGATCCTCCC CTCTGTTCCCTCTGCCTCAGOL.620CTGAGGCAGAGGGAACAGAGGGGAGGATCGCAAAATCTGTCTTCCCTTTGTCTGCTAATCACCCCTCCCAACCATACACA GCATAAAAGCAGCTGAGGAOL.621CAGCCATGAGGACTACATCAGOL.622AGCCAGTTCCTTCTCAGAGAAOL.623TCCTCAGCTGCTTTTATGCTGTGTCATGGTTGGGAGGGGTGATTAGCAGACAAAGGGAAGACAGATTTTGCTGAGTCACC CTCTGTTCCCTCTGCCTCAGOL.624CTGAGGCAGAGGGAACAGAGGGTGACTCAGCAAAATCTGTCTTCCCTTTGTCTGCTAATCACCCCTCCCAACCATGACACA GCATAAAAGCAGCTGAGGAOL.625TCCTCAGCTGCTTTTATGCGATCCTCTGGTTGGGAGGGGTGATTAGCAGACAAAGGGAAGACAGATTTTGCGATCCTCCC CTCTGTTCCCTCTGCCTCAGOL.626CTGAGGCAGAGGGAACAGAGGGGAGGATCGCAAAATCTGTCTTCCCTTTGTCTGCTAATCACCCCTCCCAACCAGAGGAT CGCATAAAAGCAGCTGAGGAOL.627CACTGAGAGAAACTATTACACAAGCCACATTAGCATGACTCATTGTTTCTGATCAGOL.628CTGATCAGAAACAATGAGTCATGCTAATGTGGCTTGTGTAATAGTTTCTCTCAGTGOL.629CACTGAGAGAAACTATTACACAAGCCACATTAGCAGATCCTCTTGTTTCTGATCAGOL.630CTGATCAGAAACAAGAGGATCTGCTAATGTGGCTTGTGTAATAGTTTCTCTCAGTGThe substitutions K143A, L150A, and L157A in oligonucleotides OL.582–OL.587 are shown in boldface type and are underlined.

Open table in a new tab In Vitro TranslationA 5.4-kb pcDNA 3 with 1 kb coding hBVR was used as vector to generate in vitro transcribed mRNA with T7 RNA polymerase. The transcribed mRNA was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using rabbit reticulocyte lysate. In vitro translation was performed using micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). A 50-μl reaction mixture was prepared by using 35 μl of lysate, 1 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 2 μl of 1 mm amino acid mixture minus methionine, 1 μl of RNase inhibitor and 5 μl of translation grade [35S]methionine. 5 μl of transcribed mRNA was added to the above reaction mixture and immediately incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. The in vitro translated proteins were resolved on 12% SDS or native polyacrylamide gel along with rainbow or native high molecular weight markers, respectively (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 30% methanol and then treated with autoradiography enhancer (Amplify; Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 2 h and autoradiographed at −70 °C.Preparation of 32P-labeled DNA FragmentsA 56- or 100-bp DNA fragment with and without AP-1 sites was used for the DNA binding assay; their sequences are shown in Table I (OL.619, OL.620; OL.623–OL.630). Complementary oligonucleotides were used to generate double-stranded DNA fragments. 150-ng aliquots of annealed oligonucleotides were radioactively labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The DNA probes were purified with the Qiagen Nucleic Acid Purification Kit.PCR-generated Site-directed MutagenesisA 1-kb hBVR fragment was cut out from plasmid p507 by SalI. This 1-kb fragment was used as the template DNA for site-directed mutagenesis. Oligonucleotides (OL.582–OL.587) used for mutagenesis of hBVR leucine zipper motif at positions Lys143, Leu150, and Leu157 are shown in Table I. PCR was carried out in two steps. In the first step, the substitutions were introduced by using OL.621 or OL.622 in combination with oligonucleotides OL.582 and OL.583, OL.584 and OL.585, or OL.586 and OL.587 to generate K143A, L150A, and L157A, respectively. In the second stage of the reaction, the PCR products from the first stage were used as template DNA and were joined together by using oligonucleotides OL.621 and OL.622 (Table I). Another difference in the two-step 30-cycle PCRs was the T m, which was 48 °C in the first reaction and 43 °C in the second. The PCR products, thus formed, were purified with PCR purification kit (Concert) and digested with BlpI and HindIII. The resultant fragments were inserted in p507, which was used as a vector. Ligation was done within the gel by using 1% low melt agarose. The plasmids were amplified in XL-1 Blue cells and isolated by the Qiagen Mini Prep kit. The DNA sequencing of the mutated hBVR segment was carried out with the oligonucleotides OL.582–OL.587 (Table I) using the ABI PRISM dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Big Dye).Native and Denaturing Gel AnalysesIn vitrotranslated protein was assayed on native gel immediately after synthesis. One μl of in vitro translated material was added to 2 μl (25 ng) of annealed, unlabeled control DNA fragment. To this, 0.4 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in 14 μl of DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-chloride (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) was added. It was incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and after adding 5 μl of loading buffer (1.5× DNA binding buffer with bromphenol blue dye), samples were resolved on 12% native polyacrylamide gel in Tris-acetate/EDTA buffer at 35 milliamps. The control DNA helps to prevent the formation of nonspecific protein aggregates, thereby increasing the resolution of protein bands (26Halazonetis T.D Georgopoulos K. Greenberg M.E. Leder P. Cell. 1988; 55: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). A portion of the translated protein was treated with SDS and analyzed on a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel.DNA Binding AssayAs with native gel analysis, in vitro translated proteins were assayed for DNA binding immediately after synthesis. 1 μl of translated material was added to 5000–500,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA fragment representing ∼2–3 ng of DNA. 0.1 μg of poly(dI·dC) in 10 μl of DNA binding buffer was added to the labeled DNA. After incubating samples for 20 min at room temperature, 5 μl of loading buffer was added. The samples were resolved on 12% native polyacrylamide gel with 35 milliamps at 4 °C. The gels were processed as described above. Dried gels were put on two pieces of film separated by a piece of paper. Autoradiography was done at −70 °C for different time periods.Western Blot AnalysisFor Western blot analysis, the primary antibody was rabbit anti-human kidney BVR (27Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with ECL detection system RPN 2106 (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, in vitro translated hBVR was subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Pall Corp.), and subjected to Western blot analysis as described earlier (1Salim M. Brown-Kipphut B.A. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10929-10934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).COS Cell Transfection and BVR MeasurementA cytotoxicity curve for the drug G418 sulfate (Geneticin), used as a marker for the selection of clonal cell lines, was established for exponentially grown COS cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (37 °C, 5% CO2). At a concentration of 440 mg/ml and beyond, the drug was found toxic to the parental cell line. Therefore, the selection medium contained G418 at a concentration of 450 mg/ml. pcDNA3 plasmid containing the antisense sequence was isolated from E. coli cultures using Qiagen Midi Prep kit. Transfection was carried out by electroporation. The following day, transfected cells were split 1:2 and seeded on a 100-mm culture dish in the selection medium. The selection process was continued for 8–10 days with a change of selection medium every 2 days. Cells grown in culture flasks to 75% confluence were pooled from three flasks and were used for BVR enzyme activity measurement and mRNA analysis. BVR activity was measured from an increase in absorbance at 450 nm as described before (5Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bilirubin as the substrate and NADH as the cofactor. The activity is expressed as units, a unit representing 1 nmol of bilirubin formed/min/mg of protein.Northern BlottingThe HO-1 hybridization probe was a 569-base pair HO-1 fragment corresponding to nucleotides 86–654 of rat HO-1 cDNA (28Shibahara S. Muller R.M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12889-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from a minimum of three culture flasks were pooled and used for each analysis. Total RNA was extracted from COS cells for preparation of poly(A)+ RNA that was separated by electrophoresis on denaturing formaldehyde gel, and transferred onto a Nytran membrane. The HO-1 and actin probes were labeled using [α-32P]dCTP with the Random Primers Labeling System (Invitrogen). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed as described previously (29Ewing J.F. Maines M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5364-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Blots were probed sequentially with HO-1 and actin. The signals were quantitated using TempDens Platform version 1.0.0 and are expressed relative to that of the control. The control level is arbitrarily given the value of 1.RESULTSThe comparison of the primary structure of hBVR between amino acids 100 and 157 with known leucine zipper-type DNA binding proteins shows certain common features (Fig. 1). These include the five repeating amino acids L1, L2, K3, L4, and L5, spaced every seventh residue, and a basic domain that is flanked by an upstream alanine residue and starts exactly seven residues N-terminal to L1. There are, however, differences in the primary structure of hBVR and those of most leucine zipper DNA binding proteins; a second basic domain that is present in DNA-binding proteins GCN4, c-Jun, c-Fos, and YAP-1 is not present in BVR. Fig.2 shows the secondary structure of hBVR, which is modeled after x-ray diffraction analyses of rat BVR crystal structure and shows a U-shaped α-helix-turn-β motif for the leucine zipper motif. Residues that form heptads are identified by a space-filling model. It is noted that a leucine-rich α-helix-turn-β structure is also present in porcine ribonuclease inhibitor and is involved in heterodimer and homodimer formations (12Kobe B. Diesenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 13Kobe B. Diesenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). On the basis of the crystal structure, Kobe and Deisenhofer (12Kobe B. Diesenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 13Kobe B. Diesenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar) have shown that the leucine-rich repeat of the ribonuclease inhibitor is also “horseshoe-shaped.”Figure 2The predicted three-dimensional structure of hBVR. Rat BVR coordinates were used to model the three-dimensional structure of hBVR. The residues of the leucine zipper (green and red) at key positions Leu129, Leu136, Lys143, Leu150, and Leu157 are shown in the space-filling model. Residues between Leu129 and Lys143 are predicted to form an α-helix; those between Lys143 and Leu157 form a β-sheet.N and C denote the N and C terminus, respectively. The figure was generated with the molecular graphic program RasMol (36Ahmad Z. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18450-18456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)hBVR Forms a Homodimer and Binds DNAObservations with the primary and secondary features of hBVR were followed by examination of whether hBVR forms a dimer, and if so, whether the dimer interacts with DNA. For DNA interaction analysis, 56-mer and a 100-mer (TableI) DNA fragments encompassing AP-1 sites were used. The 56-mer fragment was a random fragment with one AP-1 site used for investigation of c-Jun and c-Fos DNA binding (26Halazonetis T.D Georgopoulos K. Greenberg M.E. Leder P. Cell. 1988; 55: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). AP-1 also has been tested for GCN4 binding (30Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1985; 43: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The 100-mer DNA fragment corresponded to the HO-1 promoter region encompassing two AP-1 sites (31Alam J. Cai J.

In order to bind to DNA, leucine zipper type proteins form a dimer, which takes place at the leucine zipper motif (32Busch S.J. Sassone-Corsi P.

Most proteins bearing this structural feature form homodimers, and dimer formation is required for its efficient DNA binding. The only known exception, Fos, forms a stable heterodimer with Jun oncoprotein (17Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined hBVR for homodimer formation immediately afterin vitro translation of hBVR mRNA, using cold native polyacrylamide gel (4 °C), and employed denaturing/SDS-polyacrylamide gel to dissociate the dimer immediately after in vitro translation of hBVR mRNA, should it be formed. On the native gel, the translated protein migrated as an approximately 69-kDa protein (Fig. 3). The protein size was assessed using standard native high molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific protein aggregation was prevented by the addition of control unlabeled DNA (26Halazonetis T.D Georgopoulos K. Greenberg M.E. Leder P.

For this, the in vitro translated protein was examined on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was processed either for autoradiography (Fig.4 A) or for Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 B). As shown in the autoradiogram, two prominent bands at ∼35 and ∼40 kDa were detected. hBVR, based on its predicted amino acid composition, has a molecular mass of ∼34 kDa (4Maines M.D. Polevoda B.V.

https://openalex.org/W2089807533,"Giardia is an intestinal parasite that belongs to the earliest diverging branch of the eukaryotic lineage of descent. Giardia undergoes adaptation for survival outside the host's intestine by differentiating into infective cysts. Encystation involves the synthesis and transport of cyst wall constituents to the plasma membrane for release and extracellular organization. Nevertheless, little is known about the molecular events related to cyst wall biogenesis inGiardia. Among the components of the cyst wall there are two proteins that we have previously identified and characterized: CWP1 (26 kDa) and CWP2 (39 kDa). Expression of these proteins is coordinately induced, and both concentrated within encystation-specific secretory vesicles before their extracellular polymerization. Although highly similar to each other at the amino terminus, CWP2 includes a COOH-terminal 121-amino acid extension. Here, we show that this extension, rich in basic residues, is cleaved from CWP2 before cyst wall formation by an intracellular cysteine proteinase activity, which is induced during encystation like CWPs. Specific inhibitors prevent release of cyst wall materials, abolishing cyst wall formation. We also report the purification, cloning, and characterization of the encystation-specific cysteine proteinase responsible for the proteolytic processing of CWP2, which is homologue to lysosomal cathepsin C. Encystation-specific cysteine proteinase ESCP possesses unique characteristics compared with cathepsins from higher eukaryotes, such as a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. These features make this enzyme the most divergent cathepsin C identified to date and provide new insights regarding cyst wall formation in Giardia.

CWP predict acidic and leucine-rich proteins of 26 (CWP1) and 39 (CWP2) kDa targeted to the secretory pathway by amino-terminal signal peptides. The amino-terminal overlapping domains of CWP1 and CWP2 are 61% identical in sequence; contain a cysteine-rich region and five tandem copies of leucine-rich repeats. Besides these similarities, CWP2 is distinguished from CWP1 by a 121-residue carboxyl-terminal extension that is rich in basic amino acids. This extension, which accounts for the differences in molecular mass and pI of the two proteins, appears implicated in the sorting of the CWP1-CWP2 complex to the ESVs (4Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Review. 1997; 61: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in purified ESVs CWP2 is mainly found as a 39-kDa protein (26 kDa from the CWP1-like region plus 13 kDa from the alkaline tail); however, in purified cyst walls, only a 26-kDa fragment could be found (4Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Review. 1997; 61: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), suggesting that proteolytic processing of CWP2 occurs before this protein is incorporated into the cyst wall. Formation of cell walls (i.e. during cyst or spore development) is a common characteristic of several protozoan parasites (3Gillin F.D. Reiner D.S. McCaffery M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 679-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Review. 1997; 61: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cyst wall formation in Giardia is an interesting biological problem because the synthesis of cyst wall components takes place within the cell, but their deposit and fibrillar organization occur extracellularly. In consequence, there must be particular mechanisms to carry the precursors and the machinery for cyst wall assembly to the cell surface, avoiding their polymerization inside the cell (4Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Review. 1997; 61: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to analyze the proteolytic processing of CWP2 in the context of the regulated secretory pathway that develops during Giardiadifferentiation into cysts. Our results indicate that an intracellular cysteine proteinase activity is involved in CWP2 cleavage and that specific inhibitors of this enzymes block the release of cyst wall precursors from the ESVs, abolishing cyst wall formation during differentiation. Due to the importance of this proteinase for the completion of the life cycle ofGiardia, we attempted its isolation and molecular characterization. The identified gene encodes a protein homologous to lysosomal cathepsins C of higher eukaryotes but, in contrast to those enzymes, Giardia cysteine proteinase possesses a transmembrane domain and a short cytosolic tail. Trophozoites of the isolate WB, clone 1267 (21Mowatt M.R. Aggarwal A. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), were cultured as described (22Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C.C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med.

Trophozoites were grown in pre-encystation medium for 2 days, the medium was then replaced with encystation medium containing different proteinase inhibitors (see Table I), and cells maintained at 37 °C for 24 h. Cysts were recovered from the medium and trophozoites collected and resuspended in tap water (23Boucher S.M. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

For immunofluorescence assays, cells cultured in growth medium, pre-encystation medium, or encystation medium were harvested and processed as described previously (10Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R.

The specimens were mounted, viewed on a Leica IRME fluorescence microscope; images were captured with a Leica DC250 camera, and processed with Leica QFluoro Software. Detection of proteinase activities was done using non-boiled samples in 15% acrylamide gels containing 0.2% gelatin (28Palmer E.G. So M. Davis C.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Proteinase activity was assessed by adding inhibitors to the gel incubation buffer. Since substrate-copolymerized acrylamide gels may change the mobility of proteins, the correct molecular weight of the protease activities was determined as following. After standard SDS-PAGE using non-boiled samples, gels were placed over a glass plate and an indicator gel (containing 15% polyacrylamide plus 0.1% recombinant CWP2 or gelatin) was placed on top. A second glass plate was laid over, and the resulting sandwich held in place by two clamps and immersed in a chamber filled with citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at room temperature. Diffusion of proteins from the electrophoresis gel to the indicator gel was allowed for 15 h. Once transfer was completed, the indicator gel was immersed into 2% Triton X-100, and incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking at room temperature. Then, it was rinsed twice with distilled water and incubated in citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 1 mm DTT, for 6 h at 37 °C. The indicator gels were stained, destained, and interpreted for proteinase activity (28Palmer E.G. So M. Davis C.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To purify the cysteine proteinase, trophozoites were induced to encyst and harvested as described (23Boucher S.M. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell pellet was suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100 and sonicated until no intact trophozoites were visualized by light microscopy. The homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. To the supernatant, (NH4)2SO4 was added at different percentage of saturation at 0 °C. The fraction at 50% saturation was centrifuged and the pellet was dissolved in 25 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. This material was dialyzed for 12 h against 3,000 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, and applied to an anion-exchange column (NITRAP Q, Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted using a NaCl continuous gradient (0 to 1 m) and fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed for proteinase activity using gelatin-containing gels. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, dissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then applied to a Sephadex G-100 column. Finally, affinity chromatography using cystatin-Sepharose was performed as reported (29Labriola C. Cazzulo J.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 129: 143-148PubMed Google Scholar). Purified enzyme was transferred to Immobilon (Millipore) membranes and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The band was excised and subjected to Edman degradation on a PerkinElmer Biosystems Model 477A Gas-Phase Protein Sequencer as a service of the Protein and Nucleic Acid Shared Facility, Medical College of Wisconsin. The cDNA fragments encoding CWP1 or CWP2 genes, without the signal peptide sequence, were inserted into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pGEX-4T. The resulting constructs encoding a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein were transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15 K12. Since preliminary experiments indicated that rCWP2 underwent proteolysis under the conditions used for purification, a His6 tag was inserted at the 3′-end of the GST-CWP2 construct to perform a two-step purification approach. Purification was done using the GST Gene Fusion System (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Once the column with bound protein was washed, the fusion protein was eluted by the addition of 10 mm reduced gluthatione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Glutathione S-transferase was removed using 10 units of thrombin. For CWP2, we performed a second step purification using the QIAexpressionist System (Qiagen). The sample obtained after been treated with thrombin was mixed with Ni-NTA matrix, washed several times, and eluted by competition with imidazole. Purified rCWP2 was mixed with the purified cysteine proteinase and incubated in citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 1 mm DTT for 12 h at 37 °C. The sample was incubated in sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol, fractionated in 15% SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting as indicated above. Encysting trophozoites were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1.0% Triton X-114 at 0 °C and processed as reported (30Bordier C. J. Biol.

After phase separation, Triton X-114 and buffer were added to the aqueous and detergent phases, respectively, to obtain equal volumes and approximately the same salt and surfactant content for both samples. Giardia RNA was extracted from trophozoites by RNA Total Isolation Kit (Promega). Genomic DNA was obtained as described (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

In this paper we describe two novel human cell lines that are capable of expressing high levels of iNOS under the control of analogues of either the insect hormone ecdysone or tetracycline. We have entrapped these iNOS-expressing cells within a semipermeable alginate-poly-L-lysine membrane as a means of delivery to tumor sites in a nude mouse model. These encapsulated cells can be induced to generate sustainable high concentrations NO and reactive nitrogen species at tumor sites after treatment either with ponasterone A or muristerone A or with doxycycline. Delivery of these iNOS-expressing cells to tumors formed from human ovarian cancer SKOV-3 cells results in 100% killing, whereas treatment of tumors formed from human colon cancer DLD-1 cells results in 54% killing. We show that in these iNOS-expressing cells, tumor killing is associated with concomitant up-regulation of the Fas/FasL proteins."

In a variety of experimental systems, representing the sequential events of the angiogenic process, aeroplysinin-1 treatment of endothelial cells resulted in strong inhibitory effects. Aeroplysinin-1 inhibited the growth of endothelial cells in culture and induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Capillary tube formation on Matrigel was completely abrogated by addition of aeroplysinin-1 at the low micromolar range. Aeroplysinin-1 also exhibited a clear inhibitory effect on the migration capabilities of endothelial cells. Zymographic assays showed that aeroplysinin-1 treatment produced a decrease in the concentration of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and urokinase in conditioned medium from endothelial cells. Finally, aeroplysinin-1 exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the in vivo chorioallantoic membrane assay, showing potent apoptosis-inducing activity in the developing endothelium. The in vivo inhibition of angiogenesis by aeroplysinin-1 was confirmed by the Matrigel plug assay. Together, our data indicate that aeroplysinin-1 is a compound that interferes with key events in angiogenesis, making it a promising drug for further evaluation in the treatment of angiogenesis-related pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2039732477,"Functional foods enriched with plant stanols lower atherogenic LDL cholesterol concentrations. This effect is caused at least partly by a decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption. It has been suggested that LDL production is reduced after plant stanol consumption, but it is unknown whether LDL receptor expression is affected and contributes to the LDL-lowering effect of plant stanols. Markers for endogenous cholesterol synthesis (lathosterol) increase, but it is not known how this higher cholesterol synthesis is regulated at the molecular level. In a double-blind placebo controlled trial, we have found that compared with the control group (N=15), daily consumption of 3.8-4.0 g plant stanol esters (N=29) for 8 weeks increased LDL receptor mRNA levels in human mononuclear blood cells by 43% (P=0.003). LDL receptor protein concentrations on the surface of monocytes and T lymphocytes increased by 37% (P=0.003) and 25% (P=0.013), suggesting an increased translation. This increased protein expression appeared to be functional, since changes in serum LDL cholesterol correlated negatively with changes in LDL receptor mRNA levels (r=-0.361; P=0.015) and changes in LDL receptor protein expression in monocytes (r=-0.440; P<0.001) and T lymphocytes (r=-0.307; P=0.018). Based on these results, we suggest that the higher LDL receptor expression contributed to a lowered LDL formation along the apoB cascade. Whole body cholesterol synthesis increased, as indicated by the rise in serum cholesterol-standardized lathosterol concentrations, but the 34% increased HMG-CoA reductase mRNA concentrations did not reach statistical significance. Nor did it correlate significantly with changes in serum cholesterol-standardized lathosterol concentrations. This suggests that HMG-CoA reductase may be only partly regulated at a transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2051832002,"In this study of 301 blood samples from 21 subjects, we found markedly higher levels of DNA damage (nonpyrimidine dimer types) in the summer than in the winter detected by single-cell gel electrophoresis. The level of DNA damage was influenced by the average daily influx of sunlight < 50 days prior to blood sampling. The 3 and 6 day periods before sampling influenced DNA damage the most. The importance of sunlight was further emphasized by a positive association of the DNA damage level to the amount of time the subjects had spent in the sun over a 3 day period prior to the sampling. The effect of sunlight was comparable to the interindividual variation, indicating that sunlight exposure and the individual's background were the two most important determinants for the basal level of DNA damage. Influence of other lifestyle factors such as exercise, intake of foods, infections, and age could not be detected. Our results suggest that sunlight penetrates the outer layer of the human epidermis and damages the DNA in mononuclear cells circulating in the vessels of the skin."
https://openalex.org/W2075255802,"DEF-1/ASAP1 is an ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein (ARF GAP) that localizes to focal adhesions and is involved in cytoskeletal regulation. In this paper, we use a cell-based ARF GAP assay to demonstrate that DEF-1 functions as a GAP for ARF1 and not ARF6 in vivo. This degree of substrate preference was unique to DEF-1, as other ARF GAP proteins, ACAP1, ACAP2, and ARFGAP1, were able to function on both ARF1 and ARF6. Since transient overexpression of DEF-1 has been shown to interfere with focal adhesion formation and platelet-derived growth factor-induced membrane ruffling, we investigated whether NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing DEF-1 have altered cell motility. Here we report that ectopic DEF-1 enhances cell migration toward PDGF as well as IGF-1. This chemotactic effect appears to result from a general increase in cell motility, as DEF-1-expressing cells also exhibit enhanced levels of basal and chemokinetic motility. The increase in cell motility is dependent on DEF-1 GAP activity, since a DEF-1 mutant lacking the GAP domain failed to stimulate motility. This suggests that DEF-1 alters cell motility through the deactivation of ARF1. In contrast, the inhibition of cell spreading by DEF-1 was not dependent on GAP activity, indicating that spreading and motility are altered by DEF-1 through different pathways.

There are six different mammalian isoforms of ARF, which have been divided into three classes based on sequence similarities. Class 1 consists of ARF1, ARF2, and ARF3; Class 2 consists of ARF4 and ARF5; and Class 3 is represented by ARF6 (3Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Of the ARF family, ARF1 and ARF6 are the most thoroughly characterized. ARF1 predominantly localizes to the internal membranes of the Golgi apparatus and is important for endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport (4Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol.

ARF1 has also been implicated in the regulation of focal adhesions (FAs) (10Norman J.C. Jones D. Barry S.T. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1981-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ARF6 localizes to the plasma membrane and endosomes, where it is thought to function in endocytosis (11Peters P.J.

Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), including the formation of membrane ruffles, filopodia, and actin-rich protrusions. As with other G proteins, the activation state of ARFs is regulated by interaction with guanine nucleotides. ARFs are considered inactive in their GDP bound state and active when binding GTP. This cycle between GDP- and GTP-bound states is under the control of two groups of regulatory factors. The regulators that activate ARFs are GTPase exchange factors, which facilitate ARFs to release bound GDP, thus allowing for interaction with GTP. Deactivation is accomplished through the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP by the intrinsic GTPase activity of ARFs. Due to extremely low rates of intrinsic GTPase activity (14Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ARFs require ARF GAPs, which stimulate their GTPase activity. The first ARF GAP to be described was ARFGAP1, a protein with a CXXCX 16CXXC zinc finger motif, which has proved to be the hallmark of the catalytically active ARF-GAP domain (15Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Another GAP protein with this zinc finger is DEF-1/ASAP1 (differentiation enhancing factor-1/ARF GAP containing SH3, ANK repeat, and pleckstrin homology domains). DEF-1 was independently cloned based on its enzymatic ARF GAP activity as well as through its interaction with Src (16Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 17King F.J. Hu E. Harris D.F. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2330-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DEF-1 belongs to a family of related ARF GAP proteins, which consist of DEF-2/PAP, ACAP1, and ACAP2. In vitro ARF GAP assays have determined that DEF1 and DEF2 have a substrate preference for ARF1 and ARF5, with only modest activity toward ARF6 (16Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ACAP1 and ACAP2 possess greater activity toward ARF6 than to either ARF1 or ARF5 (19Jackson T.R. Brown F.D. Nie Z. Miura K. Foroni L. Sun J. Hsu V.W. Donaldson J.G. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). DEF1, DEF2, ACAP1, and ACAP2 are all involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (19Jackson T.R. Brown F.D. Nie Z. Miura K. Foroni L. Sun J. Hsu V.W. Donaldson J.G. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). DEF-1 localizes to peripheral FAs, and overexpression of DEF-1 reduces the formation of FAs and PDGF-stimulated dorsal ruffles (20Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with DEF-1 functioning as a regulator of cytoskeleletal remodeling. Cell motility is a complex process that depends on the ability of a cell to form new FAs at the leading edge and to dissolve old FAs at its trailing edge (22Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 23Stossel T.P. Cell. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Google Scholar). This coordinated FA turnover provides the attachment points necessary for the cytoskeleton to pull the cell body in a given direction. Thus, disruption of FA turnover by DEF-1 expression would be predicted to alter the ability of cells to move. We have tested this prediction using a modified Boyden chamber cell motility assay and found that NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing DEF-1 have increased basal, chemokinetic, and chemotactic motility. These effects are mediated through DEF-1′s GAP activity, as a DEF-1 mutant lacking the GAP domain does not increase cell motility. COS-1 (African green monkey kidney), and HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were grown in 10-cm diameter or six well tissue culture plates (Falcon) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 cells were grown in 10% calf serum. All cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 7.5% CO2. HEK 293 transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Full-length glutathione S-transferase-tagged DEF-1 protein was produced in the FastBac baculovirus/Sf21 system (Invitrogen), purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and sent to Covance for the generation of an anti-DEF-1 polyclonal antibody. The resulting antiserum was purified by ImmunoPure (A) IgG purification kit (Pierce). Anti-FLAG antibody (M5) was purchased from Sigma. Carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged ARF1 and ARF6 cDNAs were subcloned from a pXS vector (11Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J.

Cells were scraped, cleared at 13,000 × g and normalized for total protein levels using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates were mixed with 3× electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and immunoblotted using dilutions of 1:1000 (M5) or 1:5000 (anti-DEF-1) antibodies. Signal was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence as specified by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GAP activity was assayed as described previously (25Langille S.E. Patki V.

Briefly, COS-1 cells were plated into six-well tissue culture plates and tranfected by FuGENE 6 with 0.75 μg of HA-tagged ARF1 or ARF6 in addition to 1.25 μg of DEF-1, ACAP1, ACAP2, ARFGAP1, or pCDNA3 vector. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were labeled with 325 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 16 h and then harvested. Ectopically expressed ARF proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using affinity purifed HA.11 monoclonal antibody (Covance). ARF immunoprecipitates were extensively washed, eluted, separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Merck), and imaged by PhosphorImager analysis. In the absence of an ARF GAP, roughly 8% of ectopic ARF1 was in its active, GTP-bound state, while ∼15% of ARF6 was active. All data were normalized to the basal ARF activation level exhibited in each experiment, which was set at 100%. Expression levels of ARFs and ARF GAP proteins were ascertained by Western blot analysis. HEK 293 EBNA cells maintained in 400 μg/ml G418 were transfected with 8 μg each of pWZL DEF-1, pWZL ΔZA, or pWZL enhanced green fluorescent protein and expression plasmids coding for GagPol and VSVg envelope using the BES calcium phosphate method (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Media were collected from producer cells 3 days post-transfection, subjected to 0.45-micron filtration, and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. All viruses were titered by colony formation assays in NIH 3T3 cells. NIH 3T3 cells were plated at 40% confluence and infected at an multiplicity of infection of 2. Eighteen hours later, cells were passaged and placed in 2 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Selection was complete after 5 days. The motility response of stably infected NIH 3T3 cells was assayed using a modified Boyden chamber. Cells were plated in T75-cm2 flasks at 0.5 × 106 cells per flask and allowed to grow for 48 h (∼60% confluent) prior to the migration assay. The upper half of transwell (8 μm pore; Costar) membranes were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml; Becton Dickinson) overnight at 4 °C to facilitate cell adhesion. Coated membranes were rinsed with PBS and allowed to air dry immediately before use. Cells were detached by trypsinization, treated with trypsinization neutralization solution (Clonetics), and resuspended at a final concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were added to the upper chamber of the transwell and allowed to migrate toward the bottom chamber containing DMEM, or DMEM supplemented with the chemoattractants PDGF or IGF-1, for 4 h in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. For the checkerboard assay, PDGF was added to either the upper or lower chamber in concentrations as indicated. Transwell filters were rinsed once with PBS and fixed and stained using a Diff-Quik kit (Baxter) following the manufacturer's protocol. Stained filters were cut out of the chamber and mounted onto slides using Permount (Sigma). The number of migrated cells were measured using microscopy (three fields from each membrane were captured using a 10× objective), and images were captured with a CCD camera using SPOT software. Total migration per membrane was quantified from the captured images using Scion Image software (National Institutes of Health). All experiments were run in triplicate. HEK 293 cells were plated at 50% confluence in six-well tissue culture plates and co-transfected the next day with 1.5 μg of DEF-1 constructs in addition to 0.3 μg of GFP-pcDNA3. At 24–48 h post-transfection, cultures were examined under fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Diaphot 200 to identify transfectants. Transfectants were scored based on their degree of spreading on the tissue culture substrate. Only cells exhibiting complete rounding were scored as deficient for spreading. 200–300 individual cells in each population were scored for each experiment. Experiments were repeated three times. For spreading assays performed under conditions of stable expression, control GFP, DEF-1, and ΔZA expressing NIH 3T3 pooled populations were detached from tissue culture plates using 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% trypsin. Detached cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, washed with serum-free DMEM containing 0.5% calf serum, and allowed to equilibrate by rocking for 1 h at 37 °C. 1 × 106 cells were plated onto 10-cm diameter tissue culture plates precoated with fibronectin (Becton Dickinson) for the indicated times. The cells were fixed in Coomassie Blue stain (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 0.15% Coomassie Blue G-250) and examined by Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope with a 10×/0.30 plan Fluor objective. Cell images were printed, excised, and their projected surface area determined using a Mettler AE163 balance. Conversion of mass to area was calculated using a 0.2-mm2 standard. NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged constructs of either DEF-1, ΔZA, or vector alone were grown on one-well Nunc Lab-Tek II slides (12-565-5, Fisher Scientific) at 2 × 105 per well for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, 5 min each and fixed for 5 min in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature. Permeabilization was achieved in methanol (2 min, −20 °C), followed by two 1× PBS washes and further permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Non-specific signal was eliminated by incubating cells 30 min with 1% BSA/PBS. Primary antibodies diluted 1:400 in 1% BSA/PBS were applied to cells for 1 h at RT (anti-paxillin, P13520, BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY; anti-FAK, 05–537, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY; M5 anti-Flag, F4042, Sigma-Aldrich). Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (115–165-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was used as secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 and was applied to cells for 1 h at room temperature. Confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM410) was used to detect intracellular protein localization. Sequence comparison shows that all mammalian ARF GAPs have a zinc finger GAP domain similar to that of ARFGAP1. Fig. 1 compares the structural architecture of DEF-1 and related ARF GAP proteins with ARFGAP1. DEF-2 is most closely related to DEF-1, with identical domain organization except for a lack of the GDLPPKP repetitive motif found in DEF-1. ACAP1 and ACAP2 both terminate after the ankyrin repeats and thus lack the putative SH3 binding sites as well as the COOH-terminal SH3 domain (19Jackson T.R. Brown F.D. Nie Z. Miura K. Foroni L. Sun J. Hsu V.W. Donaldson J.G. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As noted by Brown et al. (16Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), this subset of GAP proteins have the core catalytic zinc finger flanked by an NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology domain and COOH-terminal ANK repeats. This sequence of pleckstrin homology-zinc finger-ANK motifs has been termed the PZA module (16Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). While the zinc finger is sufficient for GAP activity in the case of ARFGAP1 (15Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), PZA containing ARF GAPs require the entire module for GAP activity (16Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol.

The crystal structure of this region of DEF-2 demonstrates that the first two ankyrin repeats form an extensive interface with the zinc finger domain and generates a stable structure (27Mandiyan V. Andreev J. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6890-6898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To create a GAP-inactive DEF-1, we deleted amino acids 457–668, corresponding to the zinc finger and first two ankyrin repeats, as shown in Fig. 1 and termed the deleted DEF-1 protein ΔZA. This deletion was designed to eliminate GAP activity without disrupting conformation or stability. Furthermore, as this region also forms interactions with the ARF substrate, ΔZA is unlikely to form an unproductive complex with ARF and thus act in an interfering manner. Western blot analysis shows that ΔZA is expressed at levels comparable with DEF-1 (Fig.2 B).Figure 2GAP activity of DEF-1 and other GAPs toward ARF1 or ARF6 substrates in intact cells. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3ARF1-HA or pcDNA3-ARF6-HA and a pcDNA3-based expression construct for DEF-1, ΔZA, ACAP1, ACAP2, or ARFGAP1. Cell cultures were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and ectopically expressed ARFs were immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody (HA.11). After extensive washes, bound nucleotides were eluted, separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates, and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The activation state of ARFs was determined as the percentage of bound nucleotide corresponding to GTP, using the formula [32P]GTP/([32P]GTP + [32P]GDP). A, an autoradiograph of separated GDP and GTP by TLC comparing the activation state of wild type ARF1 and ARF6 with inactive ARF mutants (T31N, T27N) and active ARF1 mutant (Q71L).

C, a representative autoradiograph demonstrating the effect of DEF-1 and ΔZA expression on ARF1 and ARF6 GTP binding. The percentage of signal corresponding to GTP is noted below each sample. D, GAP activity of DEF-1 and other GAPs toward ARF1, as normalized to the ARF1 activation state observed in vector control populations. Data expressed as the mean ± S.E.; n = 3–5. DEF-1 significantly reduced ARF1 activation at p < 0.01 (paired Student's ttest). E, GAP activity of DEF-1 and other GAPs toward ARF6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the substrate specificity of DEF-1 in the context of whole cells and to ensure that ΔZA lacks GAP activity, the effect of expression of these proteins on the nucleotide binding state of ARFs was measured in intact cells. We investigated activity toward ARF1 and ARF6, the two most extensively characterized ARF family members. Cells co-expressing HA-tagged ARF1 or ARF6 and DEF-1 proteins were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and lysed. Ectopic ARFs were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and their activation state determined by quantitating the amount of radiolabeled GTP or GDP that co-precipitated with ARF after resolution of GTP and GDP by thin layer chromatography. To validate the cell-based GAP assay we first determined the nucleotide binding state of wild type ARF as compared with the binding state of active and inactive mutants of ARF. The basal activation states of ARF1 and ARF6, as measured in the absense of an overexpressed ARF GAP, revealed that roughly twice as much ARF6 was in its active, GTP-bound state as compared with ARF1 (14.64 ± 1.5% versus8.2 ± 0.73%; Student's t test; p = 0.001). As expected, the inactive mutants ARF1 T31N and ARF6 T27N failed to exhibit detectable levels of GTP binding, while 56% of the active point mutant ARF1 Q71L was GTP-bound (Fig. 2 A). We then measured the effect of DEF-1 expression on ARF activation. The relative expression levels of ARFs and DEF-1 proteins under the conditions of the ARF GAP assay were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 C shows a representative chromatographic separation from one experiment in which expression of DEF-1 reduced the amount of GTP bound by ARF1 from 10.3 to 5.1% but did not cause any decrease in ARF6 activation. Results from several experiments were expressed as the percentage change in ARF activation as compared with basal ARF activation (Fig. 2, Dand E). DEF-1 exhibited GAP activity when using ARF1 as substrate, reducing the basal activation state of ARF1 by 50% (Fig.2 D). This activity is specific to the GAP domain of DEF-1, since ΔZA, which has a deletion of the GAP domain, was enzymatically inactive. In contrast to its activity toward ARF1, DEF-1 demonstrated no GAP activity toward ARF6 as substrate (Fig. 2 E). In fact, while DEF-1 reduced the basal activation state of ARF1 by roughly 50%, it increased the activation state of ARF6 by 15%. While this slight activation was reproduced in three separate experiments, it is important to point out that it just fails to achieve the 95th confidence interval of statistical significance (paired Student's t test; p = 0.067). To compare DEF-1's substrate preference to other ARF GAPs, we also tested ACAP1, ACAP2, and ARF GAP1 for GAP activity. Unlike DEF-1, these other GAPs could utilize both ARF1 and ARF6 as substrate (Fig. 2,D and E). After having demonstrated that DEF-1 functions as a GAP for ARF1 in intact cells, and that ΔZA is, as expected, deficient in GAP activity, we looked for GAP-dependent effects of DEF-1 on the cytoskeleton. Given the importance of FA turnover on cell motility and the report that DEF-1 overexpression destablizes FAs, DEF-1 was tested for effects on cell motility. While previous DEF-1 cytoskeletal studies were performed under transient transfection conditions with high levels of overexpression, we studied the effect of lower levels of DEF-1 expression using retrovirally generated pooled populations of NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing DEF-1 or ΔZA. Expression levels of ectopic DEF-1 proteins were determined to be ∼10-fold over endogenous as determined by Western blotting (Fig.3 A). These stable pooled populations were assessed for chemotactic migration toward PDGF, a known chemoattractant for fibroblasts. To determine the optimal concentration of PDGF, a dose-response curve was performed using control NIH 3T3 pooled population (Fig. 3 B). Cells were plated on porous, fibronectin-coated transwells suspended above a chamber containing DMEM or DMEM supplemented with 0, 1, 5, or 25 ng/ml PDGF. Migration was assessed by counting the number of cells that moved through the pores of the transwell toward the chemoattractant during a 4-h period. The number of cells migrating through the transwells increased with greater concentrations of PDGF up to the highest tested concentration of 25 ng/ml. Subsequent studies on the effect of DEF-1 or ΔZA expression on cell migration were then measured using a subsaturating concentration of 20 ng/ml PDGF. Notably, DEF-1 stable cells exhibited an enhanced chemotactic migration response to PDGF, resulting in a 55% increase in the number of cells migrating to the chemoattractant over a 4-h period (Fig. 3 C). The reproducibility of this enhancement was demonstrated in the course of several experiments using independently generated NIH 3T3 pooled populations. DEF-1 motility enhancement was dependent on GAP activity, as ΔZA behaved similar to the control. DEF-1 stable cell lines also exhibited a slight increase in basal motility as seen by migration in the absence of PDGF. To further investigate this enhancement of non-directed migration by DEF-1, a checkerboard migration assay was performed in which increasing concentrations of PDGF were added to the top and/or bottom chambers of the transwell (Fig.4). Consistent with results in Fig.3 C, NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing DEF-1 exhibited enhanced basal migration, as determined in the transwells without PDGF in either top or bottom chambers. Conditions with increasing concentations of PDGF in only the bottom chamber show that DEF-1 enhances chemotaxis in a dose-responsive manner. Conditions with equal concentrations of PDGF in both top and bottom chambers reveal that PDGF is capable of stimulating cell motility in the absence of a gradient (chemokinesis) and that DEF-1 expression increases chemokinetic response.Figure 4Checkerboard migration assay of DEF-1 effects on PDGF-stimulated"

It was reported previously that the capsule was removed by treating microbes with heparin lyase III. We molecularly cloned a 617-residue enzyme, pmHS, which is a heparosan (nonsulfated, unepimerized heparin) synthase. RecombinantEscherichia coli-derived pmHS catalyzes the polymerization of the monosaccharides from UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA. Other structurally related sugar nucleotides did not substitute. Synthase activity was stimulated about 7–25-fold by the addition of an exogenous polymer acceptor. Molecules composed of ∼500–3,000 sugar residues were produced in vitro. The polysaccharide was sensitive to the action of heparin lyase III but resistant to hyaluronan lyase. The sequence of the pmHS enzyme is not very similar to the vertebrate heparin/heparan sulfate glycosyltransferases, EXT1 and 2, or to other Pasteurellaglycosaminoglycan synthases that produce hyaluronan or chondroitin. The pmHS enzyme is the first microbial dual-action glycosyltransferase to be described that forms a polysaccharide composed of β4GlcUA-α4GlcNAc disaccharide repeats. In contrast, heparosan biosynthesis in E. coli K5 requires at least two separate polypeptides, KfiA and KfiC, to catalyze the same polymerization reaction.

In the former two polymers, usually n = 20–100, although in the case of HA, typically n= 103–4. In vertebrates, one or more modifications including O-sulfation of certain hydroxyls, deacetylation and subsequentN-sulfation, or epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid are found in most GAGs except HA (3Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). A few clever microbes also produce GAG chains, however sulfation or epimerization has not been described. The GAGs in pathogenic bacteria are found as extracellular polysaccharide coatings, called capsules, which serve as virulence factors (4Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The capsule is thought to assist in the evasion of host defenses such as phagocytosis and complement.

Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Two E. coli capsular types, K5 and K4, make polymers composed of GAG-like polymers. The K5 capsular material is a polysaccharide called heparosan, N-acetylheparosan, or desulfoheparin, which is identical to mammalian heparin/heparan sulfate except that the bacterial polymer is nonsulfated, and there is no epimerization of GlcUA to iduronic acid (5Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The E. coli K4 polymer is a nonsulfated chondroitin backbone decorated with fructose side branches on the C3 position of the GlcUA residues (6Rodriguez M.L. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The E. coli K5 capsule biosynthesis locus contains the open reading frames KfiA–D (also calledKfa in some reports; GenBankTM accession numberX77617). At first, KfiC was stated to be a dual-action glycosyltransferase responsible for the alternating addition of both GlcUA and GlcNAc to the heparosan chain (7Griffiths G. Cook N.J. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, a later report by the same group reported that another protein, KfiA, was actually the αGlcNAc-transferase required for heparosan polymerization (8Hodson N. Griffiths G. Cook N.

Therefore, at least these two enzymes, KfiA and KfiC, the βGlcUA-transferases, work in concert to form the disaccharide repeat. Another deduced protein in the operon, KfiB, has been reported to stabilize the enzymatic complex during elongation in vivobut perhaps not participate directly in catalysis (8Hodson N. Griffiths G.

The identity and the sequence of the E. coli K4 capsular glycosyltransferase(s) has not yet been reported. Many Pasteurella multocida isolates produce GAG or GAG-like molecules as assessed by enzymatic degradation and removal of the capsule of living bacterial cells (9Rimler R.B. Vet.

Carter Type A P. multocida, the major causative agent of fowl cholera and pasteurellosis, makes an HA capsule (11Rosner H. Grimmecke H.D. Knirel Y.A. Shashkov A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 223: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A single polypeptide, the HA synthase pmHAS, polymerizes the HA chain by transferring both GlcUA and GlcNAc (12DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Type F P. multocida, the minor fowl cholera pathogen, produces a capsule composed of a nonsulfated chondroitin sensitive to Flavobacterium chondroitin AC lyase (9Rimler R.B. Vet.

Again, a dual-action chondroitin synthase, pmCS, polymerizes the chondroitin chain (14DeAngelis P.L. Padgett-McCue A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24124-24129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The capsule of another distinct P. multocida, Type D, was reported to be sensitive to heparin lyase III (9Rimler R.B. Vet. Rec. 1994; 134: 191-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of pmHS, a dual-action heparosan synthase. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher, and all molecular biology reagents were from Promega. The wild-type encapsulated Type D P. multocida isolates P-934 (swine), P-3881 (bovine), P-4058 (rabbit), and P-5695 (swine) were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture collection (Ames, IA). The strains were grown in brain heart infusion (Difco) at 37 °C. Preliminary data from a Southern blot analysis using pmHAS-based hybridization probes (12DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggested that the Type A synthase and the putative Type D synthase were not very similar at the DNA level. However, a PCR suggested that the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase genes, which encode an enzyme that produces the UDP-GlcUA precursor required for both HA and heparin biosynthesis, were very homologous. In most encapsulated bacteria, the precursor-forming enzymes and the transferases are located in the same operon. To make a hybridization probe predicted to detect the capsule locus, Type D chromosomal DNA served as a template in PCR reactions utilizing degenerate oligonucleotide primers (sense: GARTTYBTIMRIGARGGIAARGCIYTITAYGAY; antisense: RCARTAICCICCRTAICCRAAISWXGGRTTRTTRTARTG, where I is Ino; R is Ado or Guo; S is Cyd or Guo; W is Ado or Thd; and Y is Cyd or Thd) corresponding to a conserved central region in many known UDP-glucose dehydrogenase genes. The ∼0.3-kb amplicon was generated usingTaq DNA polymerase (Fisher), gel-purified, and labeled with digoxigenin (High Prime system, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A lambda library of Sau3A partially digested P-3881 DNA (∼4–9-kb average length insert) was made using theBamHI-cleaved λZap ExpressTM vector system (Stratagene). The plaque lifts were screened by hybridization (5× SSC, 50 °C; 16 h) with the digoxigenin-labeled probe using the manufacturer's guidelines for colorimetric development. E. coli XLI-Blue MRF′ was co-infected with the purified, individual positive lambda clones and ExAssist helper phage to yield phagemids. The resulting phagemids were transfected into E. coli XLOLR cells to recover the plasmids. Sequence analysis of the plasmids using a variety of custom primers as well as the GPS-1 Genome Priming System (New England Biolabs) revealed a novel open reading frame, which we called pmHS (DNA sequence facilities at Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center). We amplified and sequenced the ORF from several highly encapsulated isolates (see next section); very similar sequences were obtained. The pmHS ORF (617 amino acids) was amplified from the various Type D genomic DNA templates by 18 cycles of PCR (16DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) withTaq polymerase. For constructing the full-length enzyme, the sense primer (ATGAGCTTATTTAAACGTGCTACTGAGC) corresponded to the sequence at the deduced amino terminus of the ORF and the antisense primer (TTTACTCGTTATAAAAAGATAAACACGGAATAAG) encoded the carboxyl terminus including the stop codon. In addition, a truncated version of pmHS was produced by PCR with the same sense primer but a different antisense primer (TATATTTACAGCAGTATCATTTTCTAAAGG) to yield a predicted 501-residue protein, DcbF (GenBankTM accession numberAAK17905; Ref. 15Townsend K.M. Boyce J.D. Chung J.Y. Frost A.J. Adler B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar); this variant corresponds to residues 1–497 of pmHS followed by the residues TFRK. The amplicons were cloned using the pETBlue-1 acceptor system (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TheTaq-generated single A overhang is used to facilitate the cloning of the open reading frame downstream of the T7 promoter and the ribosome binding site of the vector. The ligated products were transformed into E. coli NovaBlue and plated on LB carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and tetracycline (13 μg/ml) under conditions for blue/white screening. White colonies were analyzed by PCR-based screening and restriction digestion. Plasmids with the desired ORF were transformed into E. coli Tuner, the T7 RNA polymerase-containing expression host, and maintained on LB medium with carbenicillin and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) at 30 °C. Mid-log phase cultures were induced with β-isopropylthiogalactoside (0.2 mm final) for 5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen, and the membranes were prepared according to a cold lysozyme/sonication method (16DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) except that 0.1 mm mercaptoethanol was included during the sonication steps. Membrane pellets were suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. The incorporation of radiolabeled monosaccharides from UDP-[14C]GlcUA and/or UDP-[3H]GlcNAc precursors (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to monitor heparosan synthase activity. Samples were usually assayed in a buffer containing 50 mmTris, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, 0–0.6 mm UDP-GlcUA, and 0–0.6 mm UDP-GlcNAc at 30 °C. Depending on the experiment, a Type D acceptor polymer processed by extended ultrasonication of a capsular polysaccharide preparation (isolated by cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation of the spent Type D culture media, Ref. 14DeAngelis P.L. Padgett-McCue A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24124-24129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was also added to the reaction mixture. The reaction products were separated from substrates by descending paper (Whatman 3M) chromatography with ethanol, 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, development solvent (65:35). The origin of the paper strip was cut out, eluted with water, and the incorporation of radioactive sugars into polymer was detected by liquid scintillation counting with BioSafe II mixture (Research Products International). The metal preference of pmHS was assessed by comparing the signal from a no metal control reaction (0.5 mm EDTA) to reactions containing 10–20 mm manganese, magnesium, or cobalt chloride. To test the transfer specificity of pmHS, various UDP-sugars (UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GalUA, or UDP-Glc) were substituted for the authentic heparosan precursors. The data from the recombinant construct containing thepmHS gene from the P-4058 strain are presented, but the results are similar to constructs derived from the P-934 or P-5695 strains. Gel filtration chromatography was used to analyze the size distribution of the labeled polymers. Separations were performed with a Polysep-GFC-P 4000 column (300 × 7.8 mm; Phenomenex) eluted with 0.2 m sodium nitrate at 0.6 ml/min. Radioactivity was monitored with an inline Radioflow LB508 detector (EG & G Berthold; 500-μl flow cell) using a Unisafe I mixture (1.8 ml/min; Zinsser). The column was standardized with fluorescein-labeled dextrans of various sizes. To further characterize the radiolabeled polymers, depolymerization tests with specific glycosidases was performed. The high molecular weight product was purified by paper chromatography. The origin of the strips was washed with 80% ethanol and air-dried and then extracted with water. The water extract was lyophilized, resuspended in a small volume of water, and split into three aliquots. Two aliquots were treated with glycolytic enzymes for 2 days at 37 °C (Flavobacterium heparin lyase III, 6.7 milliunits/μl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, or Streptomyces HA lyase, 333 milliunits/μl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8). The last aliquot was mock-treated without enzyme in acetate buffer. The aliquots were quenched with SDS and subjected to paper chromatography, and the radiolabel at the origin was measured by liquid scintillation counting. A PCR product that contained a portion of the Type D UDP-glucose dehydrogenase gene was used as a hybridization probe to obtain the rest of the Type D P. multocida capsular locus from a lambda library. We found a functional heparosan synthase, which we named pmHS, in several distinct Type D strains from different host organisms isolated around the world. In every case, an open reading frame of 617 residues with very similar amino acid sequence (98–99% identical) was obtained. In the latter stages of our project, another group deposited a sequence from the capsular locus of a Type D organism in GenBankTM(15Townsend K.M. Boyce J.D. Chung J.Y. Frost A.J. Adler B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In their annotation, the carboxyl terminus of the pmHS homolog is truncated and mutated to form a 501-residue protein that was called DcbF (GenBankTM accession number AAK17905). No functional role for the protein except glycosyltransferase was described, and no activity experiments were performed. As we describe later, membranes or cell lysates prepared from E. coli with the recombinantdcbF gene do not possess heparosan synthase activity. Another deduced gene recently uncovered by the University of Minnesota in their Type A P. multocida genome project (17May B.J. Zhang Q., Li, L.L. Paustian M.L. Whittam T.S. Kapur V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3460-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) calledpglA (GenBankTM accession number AAK02498) and encoding 651 amino acids is also similar to pmHS (73% identical in the major overlapping region). However, the pglA gene is not located in the putative capsule locus. This group made no annotation of the function of pglA. We have preliminary evidence that this protein also polymerizes GlcUA and GlcNAc residues to form heparosan (data not shown). We found that a Type D strain also appears to contain a homologous pglA gene as shown by PCR and activity analysis (data not shown). The next best heterologous matches for the pmHS enzyme in the data base are KfiA and KfiC proteins from E. coli K5; these two proteins work together to make the heparosan polymer (7Griffiths G. Cook N.J. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Hodson N. Griffiths G. Cook N. Pourhossein M. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27311-27315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is a good overall alignment of the enzyme sequences if smaller portions of the pmHS ORF are aligned separately with KfiA and KfiC (Fig.1). Some of the most notable sequence similarities occur in the regions containing variants of the DXD amino acid sequence motif. Membrane extracts derived from E. coli Tuner cells containing the plasmid encoding pmHS but not samples from cells with the vector alone synthesized polymer in vitro when supplied with both UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc simultaneously (TableI). The identity of the polymer as heparosan was verified by its sensitivity to Flavobacteriumheparin lyase III (∼97% destroyed after treatment) and its resistance to the action of Streptomyces HA lyase. No substantial incorporation of radiolabeled [14C]GlcUA into polymer was observed if UDP-GlcNAc was omitted or if UDP-GalNAc was substituted for UDP-GlcNAc. Conversely, in experiments using UDP-[3H]GlcNAc, substantial incorporation of radiolabel into the polymer was only noted when UDP-GlcUA was also present. UDP-GalUA or UDP-Glc did not substitute for UDPGlcUA. No polymerization or transferase activity was detected if the divalent metal ions were chelated with EDTA. Maximal activity was observed in reactions that contained Mn2+, but Mg2+also supported substantial incorporation (65–85% maximal). Cobalt was a weaker cofactor (∼30% maximal).Table ITransferase specificity of recombinant pmHS for sugar nucleotides2nd Sugar[3H]GlcNAc incorporationpmHS-(1–617)VectordpmNone35040UDP-GlcUA4,36040UDP-GalUA33050UDP-Glc390302nd Sugar[14C]GlcUA incorporationpmHS-(1–617)VectordpmNone14060UDP-GlcNAc14,99070UDP-GalNAc15080UDP-Glc7060Crude membranes from cells with plasmid encoding the full-length pmHS enzyme, pmHS-(1–617) (120 μg of total protein), or no insert, vector (210 μg of total protein), were incubated in 50 μl of assay buffer with 0.6 μg (based on uronic acid) of heparosan oligosaccharide acceptor for 20 min either with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (top section),or UDP-[14C]GlcUA (bottom section). The radiolabeled sugar (300 μM, 0.04 μCi) was used in the presence of the indicated second unlabeled sugar nucleotide (600 μM). The incorporation into polymer was assessed by paper chromatography. A representative experiment is shown. The recombinant pmHS incorporated only the authentic heparin precursors into polysaccharide. Open table in a new tab Crude membranes from cells with plasmid encoding the full-length pmHS enzyme, pmHS-(1–617) (120 μg of total protein), or no insert, vector (210 μg of total protein), were incubated in 50 μl of assay buffer with 0.6 μg (based on uronic acid) of heparosan oligosaccharide acceptor for 20 min either with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (top section),or UDP-[14C]GlcUA (bottom section). The radiolabeled sugar (300 μM, 0.04 μCi) was used in the presence of the indicated second unlabeled sugar nucleotide (600 μM). The incorporation into polymer was assessed by paper chromatography. A representative experiment is shown. The recombinant pmHS incorporated only the authentic heparin precursors into polysaccharide. The addition of the heparosan polymer acceptor increased sugar incorporation catalyzed by pmHS at least 7–25-fold in comparison to parallel reactions without acceptor (Fig.2), analogous to observations of pmHAS (18DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and pmCS (14DeAngelis P.L. Padgett-McCue A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24124-24129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The acceptor stimulation of activity is probably due to the lower efficiency or slower rate of initiation of a new polymer chain in comparison to the elongation stage in vitro. The exogenous acceptor sugar probably associates with the recombinant enzyme's binding site for the nascent chain and then is elongated rapidly. Analysis by gel filtration chromatography indicated that recombinant pmHS produced long polymer chains (∼1–3 × 103monosaccharides or ∼200–600 kDa) in vitro without acceptor (Fig. 3). If an acceptor polymer was supplied to parallel reaction mixtures, then higher levels of shorter chains (∼0.1–2 × 103 monosaccharides or ∼20–400 kDa added to acceptor) were more rapidly produced. Radioactivity from both labeled GlcUA and GlcNAc sugars co-migrated as a single peak in all chromatography profiles. Some chains also appear to be initiated de novo in reactions with an acceptor as evidenced by the small peak of higher molecular weight material near the void volume. Apparently, once pmHS either starts a new chain or binds an existing chain, rapid elongation is performed. We found in parallel tests that membranes or lysates prepared from recombinant cells containing the predicted dcbF gene (a truncated version of pmHS in the same expression vector; Ref. 15Townsend K.M. Boyce J.D. Chung J.Y. Frost A.J. Adler B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) do not exhibit heparosan synthase activity. Even with large amounts of total protein repeated polymerization was not observed, and no significant radiolabel incorporation above background levels was noted. In this report, we have molecularly cloned the dual-action glycosyltransferase responsible for polymerizing the heparosan backbone component of the Type D capsular polysaccharide. As discussed earlier, the first 497 residues of the pmHS protein are virtually identical to the hypothetical DcbF sequence. We have sequenced the DNA from the equivalent P-934 isolate obtained from the same United States Department of Agriculture collection as reported in Ref. 15Townsend K.M. Boyce J.D. Chung J.Y. Frost A.J. Adler B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar as well as several other Type D strains, but our results do not agree with thedcbF open reading frame. Adler and co-workers (15Townsend K.M. Boyce J.D. Chung J.Y. Frost A.J. Adler B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) appear to have made a sequencing error that resulted in a frameshift mutation; a conceptual premature termination led to the creation of the erroneously truncated dcbF annotation. Recently, we have determined that thePasteurella hyaluronan synthase, pmHAS, contains two active sites in a single polypeptide by generating mutants that transfer only GlcUA or only GlcNAc (19Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mixing the two different mutant pmHAS proteins reconstituted the HA synthase activity. We hypothesized that one domain, called A1, is responsible for GlcNAc transfer and that the other domain, called A2, is responsible for GlcUA transfer (19Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The chondroitin synthase, pmCS, transfers a different hexosamine, GalNAc, and also appears to contain a similar two-domain structure (14DeAngelis P.L. Padgett-McCue A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24124-24129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the heparosan synthase pmHS, however, is very different from other Pasteurella GAG synthases, pmHAS and pmCS. The pmHAS and pmHS enzymes both perform the task of polymerizing the identical monosaccharides; HA and heparin only differ with respect to their linkages. The creation of different anomeric linkages probably requires very distinct active sites because of the disparity between a retaining (to form α-linkages) and an inverting (to form β-linkages) transfer mechanism. The putative dual-action vertebrate heparin synthases, EXT1 and 2, also appear to have two transferase domains, but the amino acid sequences are not similar to pmHS (20Duncan G. McCormick C. Tufaro F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Two distinct regions of pmHS are similar to the E. coli K5 KfiA or KfiC proteins, suggesting the limits of the sugar transfer domains (Fig. 1). On the basis of sequence similarity, if the Kfi studies are correct, then GlcUA transfer and GlcNAc transfer occur at the amino and carboxyl portions of pmHS, respectively. The pmHS protein may be the result of the fusion of two ancestral single-action enzymes. The efficiency and convenience of combining the two required enzyme activities into a single polypeptide seem clear, but as a counterexample, the E. coli KfiA and KfiC proteins remain separate entities. Interestingly, pglA, a gene with no reported function from a Type A isolate (17May B.J. Zhang Q., Li, L.L. Paustian M.L. Whittam T.S. Kapur V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3460-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), is similar to the pmHS gene of a Type D strain. In parallel expression experiments, PglA from Type A or D strains also appears to be a heparosan synthase (data not shown). We have sequencing and enzymology projects in progress to verify the open reading frames and the activities of PglA. It is quite puzzling that the Type A strain would have a heparosan synthase as well as the known HA synthase. The major Type A capsular polymer was shown to be HA, but in retrospect a small amount of heparosan would be difficult or impossible to detect in these characterization studies (11Rosner H. Grimmecke H.D. Knirel Y.A. Shashkov A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 223: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A possible scenario for the presence of a heparosan synthase in the Type A bacteria is that the pglA gene is repressed or silent and not expressed in this host under laboratory conditions. ThepglA gene could also be a cryptic remnant from an ancestral organism (i.e. before Types A and D diverged) that has been maintained, and the gene product is still functional. Another interesting possibility is that in Type A organisms, either thepmHAS or the pglA gene is utilized at different times depending on conditions or the stage of infection; using different capsular polymers could serve as a phase-shift mechanism. We are generating antibodies to the PglA and pmHS proteins to examine these hypotheses. Bacteria-derived heparosan may be converted by epimerization and sulfation into a polymer that resembles the mammalian heparin and heparan sulfate because all the modifying enzymes have been identified (3Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). P. multocida Type D (or an improved recombinant version) may be a more economical and useful source of heparosan thanE. coli K5 for several reasons. The former microbe has a higher intrinsic biosynthetic capacity for capsule production. ThePasteurella capsule radius often exceeds the cell diameter when observed by light microscopy of India ink-prepared cells. On the other hand, visualization of the meager E. coli K5 capsule often requires electron microscopy. From a safety standpoint, E. coli K5 is a human pathogen, whereas Type D Pasteurellahas only been reported to cause disease in animals. Furthermore, with respect to recombinant gene manipulation to create better production hosts, the benefits of handling only a single gene encoding pmHS, a dual-action synthase, in comparison to utilizing KfiA and C (and probably KfiB) are obvious. The discovery of pmHS expands the known GAG biosynthesis repertoire ofP. multocida. Depending on the Carter capsular type, this widespread species produces HA, heparosan, or chondroitin. The use of the three major vertebrate GAGs as capsular polymers certainly strengthens the case for molecular mimicry or camouflage as a useful strategy for bacterial pathogens. We thank Tasha Arnett, Wei Jing, Ling Gao, and Deborah Spaulding for technical assistance and Dr. Kim Brogden and the late Dr. Richard Rimler for providing the Type D P. multocida strains and helpful advice."
https://openalex.org/W2140894582,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block prostaglandin synthesis and impair healing of gastrointestinal ulcers and growth of colonic tumors, in part, by inhibiting angiogenesis. The mechanisms of this inhibition are incompletely explained. Here we demonstrate that both nonselective (indomethacin) and COX-2-selective (NS-398) NSAIDs inhibit hypoxia-induced in vitro angiogenesis in gastric microvascular endothelial cells via coordinated sequential events: 1) increased expression of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, which targets proteins for ubiquitination leading to 2) reduced accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and, as a result, 3) reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its specific receptor Flt-1. Because HIF-1alpha is the major trigger for hypoxia-induced activation of the VEGF and Flt-1 genes, this could explain how NSAIDs inhibit hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. Exogenous VEGF and, to a lesser extent, exogenous prostaglandins partly reversed the NSAIDs inhibition of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. Taken together, these results indicate that NSAIDs inhibit hypoxia-induced angiogenesis in endothelial cells by inhibiting VEGF and Flt-1 expression through increased VHL expression and the resulting ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1alpha. This action of NSAIDs has both prostaglandin-dependent and prostaglandin-independent components."
https://openalex.org/W1987840607,"Isozymes of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) act at a prereceptor level to regulate the tissue-specific availability of active glucocorticoids. To examine the effect of this on cell proliferation and differentiation, we have developed transfectant variants of a rat osteosarcoma cell line that express cDNA for 11beta-HSD1 (ROS 17/2.8beta1) or 11beta-HSD2 (ROS 17/2.8beta2). ROS 17/2.8beta1 showed net conversion of cortisone to cortisol whereas ROS 17/2.8beta2 showed only inactivation of cortisol to cortisone. There was no significant difference in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression between the different clones. However, in proliferation and differentiation studies, ROS 17/2.8beta2 cells were completely resistant to cortisol. In contrast, ROS 17/2.8beta1 were sensitive to both cortisone and cortisol. Expression of 11beta-HSD1 decreased cell proliferation whereas 11beta-HSD2 increased proliferation. These responses appear to be due to metabolism of endogenous serum glucocorticoids; proliferation of ROS 17/2.8beta1 decreased further with exogenous cortisone or cortisol whereas ROS 17/2.8beta2 were resistant to both compounds. The pro-proliferative effects of 11beta-HSD2 were abrogated by 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, an 11beta-HSD inhibitor, and in cells transfected with cDNA encoding inactive 11beta-HSD2. Data indicate that differential regulation of 11beta-HSD1 and 2 (rather than GR expression) is a key determinant of cell proliferation. Dysregulated expression of 11beta-HSD2 may be a novel feature of tumorigenesis."

Proc. 2001; 33: 710-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), suggesting that the upstream regulatory regions might be species-specific even though the enzyme function of the α1,3GT gene product was identical (15Koike C. Friday R.P. Fung J.J. Starzl T.E. Trucco M. Transplant. Proc. 2001; 33: 710-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). If so, it would be conceivable that the loss of αGal expression in higher primates could be due to mutation in the upstream regulatory region (16Joziasse D.H. Oriol R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As a further step in a phylogenetic comparison of the αGal-positive pig with the higher primates, we employed a PCR-based cloning strategy to avoid the potential artifacts of extrapolating from partial sequences and cross-species hybridization. After obtaining the full coding region of the αGal-positive marmoset and cebus α1,3GT gene, we identified the full coding region of the gene in the αGal-negative rhesus monkey, orangutan, and human, as well as the genomic organization and upstream regulatory region in the rhesus and human. In all three αGal-negative primate species, we found that the α1,3GT gene produces a variety of transcripts that were confirmed in the rhesus samples with Northern blot analysis. The transcripts contained crucial mutations in addition to the one(s) described previously in exon 9 of the rhesus (6Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7401-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), orangutan (6Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Taken together, our findings suggest substantial revisions of the characterization of the α1,3GT gene that have implications for the molecular study of primate evolution and for the planning of xenotransplantation initiatives. After high molecular genomic DNA was isolated from the PBMC of multiple healthy adult male humans, two rhesus monkeys, and an orangutan, libraries for the three species were constructed using the Universal GenomeWalkerTM Library Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The initial gene-specific and nested primer pairs were designed from the partial exon 9 sequences of the α1,3GT gene available in the GenBankTM (Table I). Gene-specific and nested primer pairs for other regions were designed from the exonic sequences obtained from RACE or RT-PCR experiments (not shown).Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used as PCR primersHumanH9a: 5′-CTGAATGGGTGTTCCTCCAGAAATGGCT-3′H9b: 5′-TGGAAGACCTGGTCCACATCCATGCAG-3′H9m: 5′-GAAGAGGTGGCAAGACATCAGCATGATGC-3′H9n: 5′-CTGCATGGATGTGGACCAGGTCTTCCA-3′OrangutanU9a: 5′-TAGGCCAGTCGGTGGCTCAGCTACAGG-3′U9b: 5′-TGGCGGTACAAGGCAGATCCCGATGAC-3′U9m: 5′-GTGATGTTGAGAACCTGAATGGGTGTTG-3′U9n: 5′-CTGGCCAAATGGAATATATGCTGCTGACTC-3′RhesusR9a: 5′-GAGGTCAAGCCAGAGAAGAGGTGGCAACA-3′R9b: 5′-GACTTCCTCTTCTGCATGGATGTAGACCAG-3′R9m: 5′-ATGTTGAGAACCTGAATGGGTGTTCCTCC-3′R9n: 5′-CTGGCCAAATGGAATGCATGCTGCTGACTC-3′GenBank™ accession numbers are: human, J05421; orangutan, M73305; rhesus, M73306. Open table in a new tab GenBank™ accession numbers are: human, J05421; orangutan, M73305; rhesus, M73306. Using TrizolTM reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, total RNA was extracted from rhesus PBMC and spleen samples, from human PBMC and placenta (provided in the CLONTECH MarathonTM amplification kit), and from orangutan PBMC. After treatment with DNase I (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), poly(A)+ RNA was separated from total RNA using the DynabeadsTM mRNA purification Kit (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) in accordance with the protocol provided. Using the primers listed in Table I, the 5′- and 3′-RACE procedures were performed with the MarathonTM cDNA amplification kit. The thermal cycling conditions on a PerkinElmer GeneAmp System 9600 or 9700 thermocycler and TaKaRa LA Taq(Takara Shuzo, Shiga, Japan) enzyme were used for PCR procedures. Using total RNA derived from two rhesus monkeys, first-strand cDNA templates for RT-PCR were generated with the SuperScript PreamplificationTM system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Based on the sequences obtained from the RACE experiments, primers were designed and RT-PCR was performed. Comparable experiments were performed with the orangutan and human-derived specimens. The primers are listed in TableI. PCR products amplified in 5′- or 3′-RACE, GenomeWalker™-PCR, and RT-PCR were subcloned into the pCR II vector provided with the Original TA CloningTM Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Automated fluorescent sequencing of cloned inserts was performed using an ABI 377 Automated DNA Sequence Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). To confirm the results of RT-PCR in the rhesus species with NorthernMaxTM-GlyNorthernTM blots system (Ambion), total RNA was extracted from rhesus spleen tissue using TrizolTM as described above. Using the protocol provided with the kit, ∼10 μg of total RNA from each species was blotted to the BrightStar-PlusTM membrane. The BrightStarTM Psoralen-biotin nonisotopic labeling kit was employed for the biotinylated DNA probe (a 744-bp fragment of the rhesus α1,3GT exon 9). The Dual LuciferaseTM reporter assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to evaluate the promoter activity. For this purpose, a fragment of 1431 bp of the 5′-flanking region of rhesus exon 1 was inserted into the multicloning site of the pGL3-Basic vector (termed pGL3-RA), which was co-transfected with pRL-TK vector for normalization of transfection efficiency into pig aortic endothelial cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Relative luciferase activity of the pGL3-RA was measured by luminometer and compared with that of the pig promoter (12Koike C. Friday R.P. Nakashima I. Luppi P. Fung J.J. Rao A.S. Starzl T.E. Trucco M. Transplantation. 2000; 70: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The full-length genomic organization determined by the combined results of GenomeWalker-PCR, RACE, and RT-PCR consisted of nine exons and eight introns (Fig. 1), corresponding to the previously delineated porcine and mouse genomic structure (8Sandrin M.S.

A. 1989; 86: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, some cryptic exons or aberrant splicing sites were observed as described below. The total rhesus and human gene size is calculated to be more than 50 kb. 5′- and 3′-RACE experiments revealed sequences of the αGal-negative species that were highly homologous with the α1,3GT gene of αGal-positive species. 3′-RACE demonstrated the presence of poly(A) (adenylation) signal and poly(A) tail. Based on these sequences, we performed RT-PCR using a pair of primers that spanned several exons. Multiple bands were seen in human (Fig.2 A, a) and rhesus (Fig. 2 A, c), whereas only one major band was seen in the orangutan (Fig. 2 A, b). The results of any exon of a given species were identical with all three PCR methods (i.e. RACE, RT-PCR, and GW-PCR) (Fig.2 A). Moreover, the presence of transcripts for the rhesus α1,3GT gene was confirmed with Northern blot hybridization (Fig.2 A, d). We concluded that the sequences identified with all of the detection methods were derived from authentic α1,3GT mRNA in the respective αGal-negative species. Cryptic exons were found in both the rhesus and human α1,3GT gene, e.g. between exons 2 and 4, designated 3H in human and 3R in rhesus (Fig. 2 B, a andc). Exons 3H and 3R showed no homology with each other, and neither exon had any homology with the previously described mouse exon 3 (13Joziasse D.H. Shaper N.L. Kim D. Van den Eijnden D.H. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5534-5541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cryptic human exon with two size variants, both of which had poly(A) tails, was found in 18 of 22 humans between exons 7 and 8 (Fig.2 B, a) and was designated 7H. At the end of the 7Ha variant, a donor splicing site was found that spliced to exon 9 (Fig. 2 B, a). In rhesus, cryptic exons designated 6Ra and 6Rb were found between exons 6 and 7, and in addition, a third variant was found (6Rc) that included a retained intron (Fig.2 B, c). In the 5′-untranslated region, rhesus exon 2 is 112 bp, whereas human exon 2 is 269 bp (Fig.3). Comparative analysis revealed that the first half (110 bp, termed 2A) of the human exon 2 is highly homologous to rhesus exon 2, and the last half (159 bp, termed 2B) is similar to the rhesus intron 2 that extends from exon 2. Although the first half (138 bp, termed 8Ra) of the rhesus exon 8 (327 bp) showed high homology with the porcine exon 8 (138 bp), the remaining half (189 bp, termed 8Rb) resembled the porcine intron 8 sequences extending from exon 8 (Figs. 2 B, c, and 3). A single nucleotide deletion of G was found only in rhesus at the border between the region 8Ra and 8Rb (Fig. 3, position [d]), resulting in utilization of another downstream splicing site. A variety of alternative splicing patterns were demonstrated in the RACE and RT-PCR experiments (Fig. 2, A andB). In the coding region, the predominant pattern in human consisted of exons 4 through 9. Because of the cryptic exons and aberrant splicing sites in the human and rhesus genes, the alternative splicing patterns were far more varied in these αGal-negative species than in αGal-positive murine or porcine species (8Sandrin M.S. Dabkowski P.L. Henning M.M. Mouhtouris E. McKenzie I.F.C. Xenotransplant. 1994; 1: 81-88Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Strahan K.M. Gu F. Andersson L. Gustafsson K.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5534-5541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A comparative sequence analysis of splice junctions was performed on rhesus, orangutan, and human genomic DNA (Fig. 3). The results were further compared with the porcine species sequence (GenBankTM accession numbers AF221510–AF221517) (not shown), revealing high homology among the three species. As shown in Fig. 3, the pyrimidine richness in the intron 7–exon 8 boundary of both the rhesus and human was less than the pyrimidine content of the intron 3–exon 4 boundary, explaining the frequency of splicing of exon 8 in the 2 species. GenomeWalker-PCR starting at exon 1 revealed that the rhesus and human upstream regulatory region contains several SP1/GC-box, AP2, and other consensus motifs in the absence of a TATA- or CAAT-box. The findings were similar to those in the pig gene (12Koike C. Friday R.P. Nakashima I. Luppi P. Fung J.J. Rao A.S. Starzl T.E. Trucco M. Transplantation. 2000; 70: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In both the rhesus and human, as well as the pig, the region comprises a CpG island. In the upstream region between −340 and −470, the high degree of homology between the rhesus and pig, but not between the human and pig, gene is noteworthy (Fig.4). The transcription initiation site has been identified in the pig (12Koike C. Friday R.P. Nakashima I. Luppi P. Fung J.J. Rao A.S. Starzl T.E. Trucco M. Transplantation. 2000; 70: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When the transcription initiation site is identified in the human and rhesus gene, the question may be clarified as to whether there are differences in gene regulation between the human and rhesus. The intensity of expression promoted expressed by the pGL3-RA construct was 18-fold greater than the pGL3-Basic control, and that of pig was 81-fold higher (Fig. 5). The nucleotide divergence of the rhesus exon 9 sequence from that of the orangutan and human was found starting 1273 bp downstream from the 5′-end of exon 9 and spanning 420 bp (data not shown). A GenBankTM BLAST search revealed that this divergence had a striking homology with a retrovirus long terminal repeat sequence present in the baboon (GenBankTM accession number NC-000863; Ref. 17Mang R. Goudsmit J. van der Kuyl A.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We compared our results of the human, orangutan, and rhesus sequences to our αGal-positive marmoset and cebus New World monkey sequences (deposited in the GenBankTM). Our marmoset sequence also was compared with an independently submitted sequence (18Henion T.R. Macher B.A. Anaraki F. Galili U. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although the overall sequence from the start codon in exon 4 to the stop codon in exon 9 in marmoset is 1131 bp, the corresponding sequence of the human (from exon 4 to exon 9 through exon 8) or rhesus (from exon 4 to exon 9 through exon 8Ra) was 1128 or 1129 bp, respectively. Homology between human, orangutan, or rhesus to marmoset is 94.3, 94.7, or 92.4%, respectively. There were no frameshift mutations in the rhesus, orangutan, or human exons 4–6. However, five crucial mutations that might account for loss of the α1,3GT expression were identified in the human and rhesus, and three were detected in the orangutan. It is noteworthy that the mutations at the position [b] and [f] were shared by all three species. In the rhesus, at position [a] and [b] (Fig.7), corresponding to the deduced amino acid positions 75 and 81, respectively, in marmoset, a single nucleotide deletion resulted in a frameshift. At position 96 (position [c]), a single nucleotide substitution resulted in a premature stop codon. As described under “Aberrant Splicing Sites,” a single nucleotide deletion was detected at position [d] of the exon 8 splicing junction. At position 268 [f], a single nucleotide substitution also resulted in a premature stop codon. In the orangutan, a single nucleotide deletion was observed at position [b] and [g]. A premature stop codon was observed at position [f]. In human, a single nucleotide deletion was observed at the position [b], [e] and [g]. A premature stop codon was observed at position [f] and [h]. Three critical mutations were observed within exon 7, leading to the predicted nonfunctional α1,3GT expression in all frames (Figs. 6 and 7). At position [a] or [b] in the rhesus, corresponding to the deduced amino acid at positions 75 or 81, respectively, in marmoset, a single nucleotide deletion, G, from the triplet GAA (Glu) was identified, resulting in a frameshift. At position 96 (position [c]), a single nucleotide substitution resulted in a premature stop codon (from TGG (Trp) to TGA). At position 268 ([f], a single nucleotide substitution resulted in an additional premature stop codon (TAT (Tyr) to TAG). A single nucleotide deletion at position [g] was observed in both human and orangutan but not in rhesus. The premature stop codon at position [h] was observed only in human. Thus, five crucial mutations that might account for loss of α1,3GT expression were determined in human and rhesus and three in orangutan. It is noteworthy that the mutations at position [b] and [f] were shared by the rhesus monkey, ape, and human. The αGal epitopes are chemically related to the ABO blood type antigens. In the absence of expression of A or B epitopes or of αGal epitopes, antibodies develop against the respective antigens. Phylogenetic data on the emergence of the ABO antigen system (19Oliol R. Le Pendu J. Mollicone R. Vox Sang. 1986; 51: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and especially molecular studies on ABO transferase (20Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) have been valuable in determining higher primate evolution. In contrast, little comparable information is known about the molecular basis of inactivation of the gene expressing the enzyme α1,3GT upon which synthesis of the αGal epitope depends. The αGal system in lower mammals was not discovered until the 1980s (1Galili U. Shohet S.B. Kobrin E. Stults C.L.M. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17755-17762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Galili U. Clark M.R. Shohet S.B. Buehler J. Macher B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Evidence of the presence of α1,3GT gene homologues in some αGal-negative higher primates was published in 1989–1991 by three pioneer groups. Joziasse et al. (7Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Jabs E.W. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6991-6998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described an 89-bp sequence (HGT-10) in human cells that was similar to a fragment of the murine and bovine exon 4. Larsen et al. (5Larsen R.D. Rivera-Marrero C.A. Ernst L.K. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) characterized a 703-bp genomic sequence in human tissue with a high degree of homology to exon 9 of the mouse α1,3GT gene. Galili and Swanson (6Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7401-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) reported a 371-bp sequence in rhesus cells that resembled part of mouse and bovine exon 9. All three groups concluded that point mutations in exon 9 at some time in the evolutionary past of the higher primates could be the cause of the loss of αGal epitope expression. We confirmed the point mutations that had been described earlier in exon 9 of the rhesus (6Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7401-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), orangutan (6Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7401-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and human α1,3GT gene (5Larsen R.D. Rivera-Marrero C.A. Ernst L.K. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7401-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and demonstrated four additional point mutations in exons 7 and 8. The crucial mutations in the different species that result in frameshift and premature termination of translation include a deletion mutation at position [b] in exon 7 and a premature termination at position [f] in exon 9 that are shared by all three of these higher primates. Because no α1,3GT transcripts could be found in the early investigations of the African green monkey (COS) and human cell lines (4Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Tunen A.J. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14290-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility could not be dismissed that inactivation of the gene in the higher primates is due to mutations in the upstream regulatory regions of the α1,3GT gene (16Joziasse D.H. Oriol R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This potential explanation for loss of the αGal epitope was eliminated in our study using sensitive PCR methods for detection of mRNA transcripts that were not available at the time of the seminal investigations (4Joziasse D.H.

A variety of transcripts with more than 10 different splicing patterns of the α1,3GT gene were observed in the full coding region in all rhesus, orangutan, and human tissues examined. Their presence was confirmed with Northern blot of total RNA derived from rhesus spleen. Joziasse et al. (7Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Jabs E.W. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6991-6998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Joziasse D.H. Oriol R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) estimated that inactivation of the α1,3GT gene occurred between 40 and 25 millions years ago, following the divergence between higher primates (catarrhines) and the New World monkey but prior to the further divergence of the individual higher primates. The hypothesis was based on their discovery of an intron-less processed cDNA homologue (termed HGT-2) in the human genome (7Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Jabs E.W. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6991-6998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Joziasse D.H. Oriol R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, Galili and Swanson (6Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7401-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) postulated that inactivation occurred at a much later time and independently in Old World monkeys, apes, and humans (6Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7401-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Our finding of crucial point mutations shared by the rhesus, orangutan, and human at positions [b] and [f] of exons 7 and 9, respectively, appears to be more consistent with Joziasse's hypothesis (16Joziasse D.H. Oriol R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that the α1,3GT gene inactivation occurred in a common ancestor than with the suggestion by Galili and Swanson (6Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7401-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that it occurred independently in the three different lineages. However, the time and the process of the inactivation remain to be determined (6Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7401-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 7Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Jabs E.W. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6991-6998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high homology of the α1,3GT gene in the αGal-negative species to the shared sequence of the αGal-positive marmoset and cebus (Fig.7) suggests that the inactivation may have occurred more recently than previously thought. The development of preformed antibodies directed against a wide range of microorganisms or macroparasites that express αGal-like substance has been the conventional explanation for the evolution of the αGal-negative state in higher primates (1Galili U. Shohet S.B. Kobrin E. Stults C.L.M. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17755-17762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Galili U. Clark M.R. Shohet S.B. Buehler J. Macher B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The possibility cannot yet be excluded, however, that some other survival advantage drove the gene inactivation and that the protection from such infecting agents afforded by the “natural” anti-αGal antibodies was fortuitous. Whatever the reason, antibodies against the αGal epitope are responsible for the immediate (hyperacute) rejection by αGal-negative recipients of tissues and organs from αGal-positive donors, precluding successful clinical xenotransplantation from αGal-positive animals (3Cooper D.K.C. Koren E. Oliol R. Lancet. 1993; 342: 682-683Abstract PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Detailed information about the α1,3GT gene may help in mapping strategies for transgenic modification of the αGal-positive species. If higher primates were to spontaneously recover the expression of αGal epitopes, as has been described in normal breast and MCF7 human breast carcinoma cell lines (21Petryniak J. Varani J. Ervin P.R. Goldstein I.J. Cancer Lett. 1991; 60: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the potential for the development of αGal antibody-mediated autoimmune disease is implicit. Galili and co-workers (22Etienne-Decerf J. Winand R. Galili U. Autoimmunity. 1991; 10: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) observed the presence of αGal epitopes in thyroid cells of a human with autoimmune Grave's disease, but no transcripts could be detected in these cells with Northern blot. A search for α1,3GT mRNA transcripts in tissues from such “autoimmune suspect” patients may be fruitful with more sensitive PCR technology used in our study.

https://openalex.org/W2099168978,"Aldose reductase, a member of the aldo-keto reductase family, has been implicated in the development of vascular and neurological complications in diabetes. Despite recent studies from our laboratory demonstrating protection of ischemic hearts by an aldose reductase inhibitor, the presence and influence of aldose reductase in cardiac tissue remain unknown. Our goal in this study was to isolate and characterize the kinetic properties of cardiac aldose reductase, as well as to study the impact of flux via this enzyme on glucose metabolism and contractile function in hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. Results demonstrate that ischemia increases myocardial aldose reductase activity and that these increases are, in part, due to activation by nitric oxide. The kinetic parameter of cardiac aldose reductase (Kcat) was significantly higher in ischemic tissues. Aldose reductase inhibition increased glycolysis and glucose oxidation. Aldose reductase inhibited hearts, when subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, exhibited less ischemic injury and was associated with lower lactate/pyruvate ratios (a measure of cytosolic NADH/NAD+), greater tissue content of adenosine triphosphate, and improved cardiac function. These findings indicate that aldose reductase is a component of ischemic injury and that pharmacological inhibitors of aldose reductase present a novel adjunctive approach for protecting ischemic hearts."
https://openalex.org/W2050501244,"Caspase-3 is the major effector in apoptosis triggered by various stimuli. Previous studies demonstrated a significant increase in transcriptional activity of the caspase-3 gene during neuronal apoptosis. Recent findings suggest that differential expression of the caspase-3 gene may underlie the regulation of apoptotic susceptibility during brain development and after acute injury to the mature brain. We identified and cloned the rat caspase-3 gene promoter, determined its structure, and examined its regulation during a course of apoptosis in PC12 cells. Results demonstrate that this promoter lacks a TATA-box and contains a cluster of Sp1 elements and multiple transcription start sites. The first identified transcription start site is located 87-bp upstream from the first splicing site. A role of Sp1 elements in the regulation of caspase-3 promoter activity is demonstrated by the inhibition of Sp1 binding using mithramycin A. Results of deletion analysis show that an Ets-1-like element located between nucleotides −1646 and −1632 relative to the most extended transcription start site is necessary to achieve sustained transcriptional activity. Homology analysis revealed that the 5′-flanking region of the human caspase-3 gene exhibits significant similarity to a regulatory region of the rat gene.

The first strong evidence supporting the specific role for this protease in neuronal apoptosis comes from studies on mice deficient in caspase-3 in which brain development is profoundly altered (8Kuida K.

Because the activation of caspases, and caspase-3 in particular, appears to be a major factor for the execution of neuronal apoptosis, the evaluation of upstream modulatory mechanisms is important for understanding the regulation of the apoptotic process. Recent findings suggest that differential expression of the caspase-3 gene may underlie the regulation of apoptotic susceptibility during brain development as well as after acute injury to mature brain (18Bittigau P.

Therefore, in addition to the regulation of proteolytic activation, a potential rate-limiting step leading to regulation of caspase-3 activity may be the transcription of this gene. This report provides the first information on the rat caspase-3 gene control region and general transcription factors required for transcriptional activity of this gene. The P1Rattus norvegicus genomic DNA library (IncyteGenomics, cat. no. P1-5538) was screened by PCR using 5′-AAATTCAAGGGACGGGTCAT-3′ and 5′-ATTGACACAATACACGGGATCTGT-3′ primers derived from the coding region of rat caspase-3 cDNA (30 cycles at 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 15 s; and 72 °C, 45 s). DNA from a PCR-positive P1 clone was isolated, digested withBamHI or HindIII restriction endonucleases, and subcloned in pZErO-2 plasmid vector (Invitrogen). One hundred recombinant DNA clones were screened using the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 5′-GGGCGGTAGGCTGCTGATGC-3′ corresponding to exon 1 of the rat caspase-3 gene. Hybridization was performed at moderate stringency (6× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.2% SDS at 37 °C). Individual positive clones were isolated after an additional round of colony purification at the same hybridization stringency. Isolated clones were then analyzed by restriction mapping with numerous restriction endonucleases and PCR followed by sequencing using the chain termination reaction. 5′-RACE1was performed using Marathon-Ready™ cDNA from Sprague-Dawley rat brain (BD Biosciences, CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, 5 μl of a cDNA sample were subjected to the first round of PCR amplification using the adaptor primer 1 and the antisense caspase-3 primer 5′-CATTTCTTTAGTGATAAAA-3′. After amplification for 30 cycles (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 15 s; and 72 °C, 2 m), the reaction products were diluted 20-fold with water, and 3 μl were then reamplified for 30 cycles using the same reaction conditions with nested primer adaptor primer 2 and the antisense caspase-3 primer 5′-ATCATGGGATCTGTTTCTTT-3′. The longest detected PCR products were then cloned in the pCR2.1 TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the chain termination reaction. The locations of transcription start sites in the rat caspase-3 gene were determined by a modified primer extension technique (30Yakovlev A.G. Krueger K.E. Faden A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6421-6424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using an oligonucleotide primer complementary to the previously determined sequence (GenBankTMU58656) from nt 59 to 76 within exon 1. Oligonucleotides were labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Inc.). Twenty micrograms of yeast (control) or rat brain RNA, pretreated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega), were reverse transcribed with 15 pmol of phosphorylated extension primer and 5 units of thermostable Tth DNA polymerase (Promega) in 30 μl of reaction mixture, as recommended by the manufacturer for reverse transcription. To amplify the signal, 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C for denaturation and 5 min at 70 °C for primer annealing and extension were performed. This process permits the thermostable Tth to reverse transcribe the same RNA templates after subsequent denaturing of RNA/DNA hybrids and reannealing with oligonucleotide. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels beside a sequencing ladder from the corresponding region of the rat caspase-3 gene obtained with the same primer used in primer extension procedures. PC12 and HeLa cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere. Progressive deletion constructs of the caspase-3 promoter were engineered by unidirectional cloning of PCR fragments from the promoter between the NheI and HindIII sites of the reporter luciferase vector pGL3-basic (Promega). Nucleotide sequences of the cloned DNA fragments were confirmed in each case using the chain termination sequencing reaction. PC12 or HeLa cells were seeded into 6-well plates and transiently transfected using Mirus TransIT-100 reagent (Panvera). Transfections included reporter plasmids and pRSVβ-galactosidase reporter vector (Promega) as an internal control. After 24 h, cells were harvested and lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity by using the Enhanced Luciferase Assay kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego) and a TD-20/20 luminometer. For β-galactosidase activity the luminescent β-galactosidase genetic reporter system (CLONTECH) was used. Levels of mRNA were analyzed with an RT-PCR approach as previously described (31Yakovlev A.G. Faden A.I. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1994; 23: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In brief, total cellular RNA was isolated by acidic phenol extraction (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar), and 5 μg was reverse transcribed with M-MLV RT (Invitrogen) in 20 μl of reaction mixture. The resulting cDNA (3 μl) was amplified by PCR. The numbers of cycles and reaction temperature conditions were estimated to be optimal to provide a linear relationship between the amount of input template and the amount of PCR product generated over a wide concentration range: from 0.5 to 10 μg of total RNA, as described in detail previously (31Yakovlev A.G. Faden A.I. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1994; 23: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Primers to amplify rat caspase-3 cDNA were 5′-GGTATTGAGACAGACAGTGG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-CATGGGATCTGTTTCTTTGC-3′ (antisense primer). cDNA was amplified for 28 cycles consisting of denaturing for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 15 s at 55 °C, and primer extension for 45 s at 72 °C. Amplified cDNA was analyzed in 2% agarose electrophoretic gels. After being stained with ethidium bromide, UV light gel images were captured and analyzed by the Image 1.59 program. Levels of individual mRNA were expressed in arbitrary units as the proportion of individual PCR product mean optical density to a control product mean optical density obtained from the same RNA sample. The cDNA for GAPDH was used as the internal control. Primers to amplify rat GAPDH cDNA were 5′-TAAAGGGCATCCTGGGCTACACT-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-TTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGG-3′ (antisense primer). GAPDH cDNA was amplified for 22 cycles at PCR conditions described for caspase-3 cDNA. The identity of each PCR-generated product to a corresponding cDNA has been confirmed by DNA sequencing (12Yakovlev A.G. Knoblach S.M. Fan L. Fox G.B. Goodnight R. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7415-7424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brains were dissected on ice and immediately homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice in lysis buffer without Triton X-100. Nuclear proteins were extracted in high salt buffer (420 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2,10% sucrose, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm NaF, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) by gentle mixing at 4 °C for 30 min. The debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 15 min. Affinity purification of nuclear proteins was performed as described previously (33Earle E. Saxena A. MacDonald A. Hudson D.F. Shaffer L.G. Saffery R. Cancilla M.R. Cutts S.M. Howman E. Choo K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (175 μg) (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were incubated with 3 μg of annealed 5′-biotin-GTAAGCTTACTTCCTAGATTGTGTA-3′ and 5′-biotin-TACACAATCTAGGAAGTAAGCTTAC-3′(wild type) or 5′-biotin-GTAAGCTTACGGGGTAGATTGTGTA-3′ and 5′-biotin-TACACAATCTACCCCGTAAGCTTAC-3′ (mutant) oligonucleotides and 60 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) on a shaker at room temperature for 30 min. The nuclear extract (250 μg) was preincubated with 125 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 125 μl of 1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 0.25 ml of gel shift buffer (GSB) (10 mm HEPES, 40 mm KCI, 2 mmMgCl2, and 5% glycerol), and 0.5 ml of distilled water for 20 min at room temperature. The extract and oligonucleotide-coated beads were combined for 20 min with gentle agitation at room temperature. The protein-bound beads were separated using a magnetic separator (Dynal), washed once in GSB, and boiled in SDS-protein sample loading buffer for 10 min. After brief centrifugation, aliquots of eluted samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with antibodies specific to Tel proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PCR-based screening of 105,300 individual clones from the P1 rat genomic DNA library (Incyte Genomics, Inc.) resulted in the isolation of one positive clone. Combined Southern blot hybridization and further PCR analysis revealed the presence in the clone of the entire transcribed region for the rat caspase-3 gene (data not shown). A 2,056-bp BamHI fragment containing the 5′-flanking sequence of the gene was subcloned into pZErO-2 plasmid vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The determined sequence was deposited to the GenBankTM data bank under accession number AF427079(Fig. 1). A 3-way alignment of the obtained sequence with the 5′-end sequences for rat caspase-3 cDNA and the mouse caspase-3 gene revealed that the cloned rat genomic DNA fragment contained the first exon, a part of intron 1, and an extended 5′-flanking region. Using REPEAT software (WebGene, the Institute of Advanced Biomedical Technologies) we identified a portion of a B3 repeated element beginning at nt 1 and ending at nt 88 within the cloned DNA fragment. Using the WWWCPG program (WebGene) a CpG island was localized at the 3′-end of this sequence (nt 1336–2056). Analysis of the 5′-flanking sequence using PromoterInspector software (Genomatix Software GmbH, Munich) resulted in the prediction of a core promoter region between nt 1637 and 1932. The predicted core promoter lacks an apparent TATA-box and contains six Sp1- and one GC-box binding sites. Based on the sequence previously obtained by 5′-RACE (GenBankTMU58656), we next determined locations of the transcription start points for the caspase-3 gene. The target mRNA was isolated from fetal rat brain because our previous results showed high levels of caspase-3 mRNA expression in this tissue (21Yakovlev A.G. Ota K. Wang G. Movsesyan V. Bao W.L. Yoshihara K. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7439-7446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primer extension reaction gave rise to multiple extension products that corresponded to a sequence extending from 6 to 12 nt upstream of that determined by us in 5′-RACE experiments (Fig. 2). The most extended transcription start site for caspase-3 mRNA from rat fetal brain can thus be assigned to a G nucleotide 87-bp upstream from the first splicing site. All positions within the rat 5′-flanking sequence have been indexed relative to this +1 transcription start site (Fig. 1). A DNA fragment of the cloned 5′-flanking caspase-3 region between positions −1841 and +88 and its serial deletion derivatives obtained by PCR were subcloned into pGL3-Basic vector, encoding the modified firefly luciferase (Promega). The resulting constructs were transiently transfected into rat PC12 or human HeLa cells, which normally express caspase-3 (34Haviv R. Lindenboim L. Li H. Yuan J. Stein R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Kobayashi D. Watanabe N. Yamauchi N. Okamoto T. Tsuji N. Sasaki H. Sato T. Niitsu Y. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 2000; 16: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Both cell lines demonstrated similar profiles of luciferase expression upon transfection with the reporter constructs (Fig. 3). Thus, luciferase expression from the most extended reporter gene (-1841/88) was ∼40-fold greater than that produced by the promotorless pGL3-Basic. A vector in which the −237/88-nt fragment that contains a predicted core promoter region was placed to drive luciferase expression failed to express detectable levels of the enzyme. Furthermore, deletion of a region containing a cluster of Sp1 elements (construct −1646/−67) also resulted in a loss of luciferase expression. Progressive deletions of the −1841/88 construct from its 5′-end revealed that the essential regulatory element(s) necessary to sustain luciferase expression is located within a 43-bp segment between nt −1646 and −1603. Deletion of this segment resulted in a decrease in luciferase expression to the level of the promotorless control. Further deletion of a region between nt −1603 and −1542 led, however, to a moderate increase in promoter activity, suggesting the presence of a negative regulatory element(s) within the −1603/−1542 segment and additional positive elements between nt −1542 and −1037 (Fig. 3). Mithramycin A is an aureolic acid antibiotic that has been shown to selectively inhibit gene expression by displacing transcriptional activators such as Sp1, which bind to GC-rich regions of promoters (36Chatterjee S. Zaman K. Ryu H. Conforto A. Ratan R.R. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because the predicted core promoter for the rat caspase-3 gene lacks a TATA-box and contains several Sp1 binding sites and one GC-box, we next determined the effects of mithramycin A on the activity of this promoter. A full-length (-1841/88) reporter contract was transiently transfected into PC12 cells, and luciferase activity was assayed after incubation of cells in the presence of 25 or 100 nm mithramycin A. The addition of mithramycin A to transfected cells led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of promoter activity with ∼40% inhibition at 25 nm and 50% inhibition at 100 nm mithramycin A concentration (Fig. 4). MatInspector-based analysis of the region between nt −1646 and −1603 (critical for promoter activity) revealed the potential presence of binding sites for Ets-1-like transcription factors (core similarity 1.000), hepatic leukemia factor (HLF, core similarity 1.000), and CEBPB transcription factor (core similarity 0.985) (Fig. 5 A). Reporter plasmids containing mutations in each individual binding site for Ets-1, HLF, or CEBPB were then constructed. To alter the HLF site a T nucleotide within a consensus binding site (ATTRYGTAAY) was deleted using the PCR approach. Four essential bases 5′-GGAA-3′ in the Ets-1 binding site were replaced with 5′-CCCC-3′. 5′-GAAA-3′ in the CEBPB site were replaced with 5′-CGGG-3′. A wild type and three mutant reporter constructs (-1646/88) were separately transfected in PC12 cells, and luciferase activity was assayed. Results demonstrated that a mutation of Ets-1 but not HLF or CEBP binding sites resulted in approximately a 4-fold decrease in the caspase-3 promoter activity (Fig. 5 B). To confirm a functional role of the Ets-1 element, three additional 10-bp deletions were introduced in the 5′-end of the promoter beginning with nt −1646. The resulting reporter constructs were transfected in PC12 cells. Results of the luciferase assay evidently showed that a small deletion of the Ets-1 binding region (from nt −1646 to −1636) was sufficient for loss of promoter activity (Fig. 5 C). To confirm the binding specificity of the predicted Ets-1-like element with members of the Ets-1 family of transcription factors we examined the binding of the Tel protein to the corresponding region of the gene. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to a wild type or a mutated form of the Ets-1-like element in the rat caspase-3 gene were attached to magnetic beads and incubated with nuclear protein extracts isolated from rat brain. After washing, bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies specific to the Tel protein (Fig. 6). Results showed that a wild type but not a mutant Ets-1 binding site was able to bind with this member of the Ets-1 transcription factor family. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR we examined the effect of growth factor deprivation on caspase-3 mRNA levels in differentiated PC12 cells. Thus, the cells in complete medium were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF (Sigma) for 5 days followed by removal of NGF and serum. As shown in Fig.7 A, such treatment caused a significant elevation in caspase-3 mRNA after 6 h. The addition of NGF to serum-free culture medium prevented an increase in caspase-3 mRNA levels. NGF did not significantly affect caspase-3 mRNA levels in the presence of serum. To examine whether the activity of the caspase-3 promoter is affected by growth factor deprivation, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with (-1646/88)-luciferase reporter plasmid, and luciferase activity was assayed after 24 h incubation with or without serum or NGF. Results demonstrated an ∼70% increase in luciferase activity in the absence of serum and NGF compared with activity in the presence of serum, NGF, or both (Fig. 7 B). A DNA fragment comprising the promoter sequence from nt −1646 to +88 was then inserted upstream from the enhanced fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene in the promoterless vector pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH), and the obtained construct was stably transfected into PC12 cells. Fluorescent microscopy examination revealed low levels of green fluorescence in transfected cells. In contrast, intensive fluorescence was observed in shrunken cells with apoptotic morphology after NGF-induced differentiation followed by 18 h of incubation under growth factor-deprived conditions (Fig.7 C). To confirm that activation of the caspase-3 promoter leads to an increase in protein levels, we examined EGFP protein expression in transfected PC12 cells as a function of time after growth factor deprivation. Using Western blot analysis we found that EGFP protein levels were elevated after 6 h of treatment (Fig.7 D). The human caspase-3 gene comprises ∼21.8 kb from nt 425446 to 447199 within the NT 006256.6 chromosome 4 working draft sequence segment. Analysis of the 5′-flanking human caspase-3 gene sequence (from nt 422092 to 425520; NT 006256.6) using PromoterInspector software (Genomatix) resulted in the prediction of a core promoter region between nt 425068 and 425487. Alignment of the rat and human predicted core promoters using LALIGN showed 61.8% identity within a 225-nt overlap (Fig. 8). Further analysis of the predicted human core promoter using MatInspector demonstrated that, similar to the rat core promoter, it lacks an apparent TATA-box but contains five Sp1- and one GC-box binding sites. Using ClustalW and LALIGN sequence alignment programs we also found that a fragment from nt 422177 to 422942 had 61.7% identity within a 788-nt overlap with the cloned rat caspase-3 gene regulatory region. This fragment is located ∼2.5-kb upstream from the transcription start site (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated up-regulation of caspase-3 gene activity during the course of apoptosis in neuronal cells; however, the significance of such gene activation remains obscure (12Yakovlev A.G.

In this report we identified the rat caspase-3 gene promoter, determined its structure, and began examining mechanisms of its regulation. The study was undertaken to test a general hypothesis that differential regulation of the caspase-3 gene may have functional consequences for the control of neuronal death. Screening of a P1 rat genomic DNA library resulted in the isolation of a 5′-flanking region of the rat caspase-3 gene. Computer analysis of the nucleotide sequence from this fragment predicted, with high probability, a core promoter located between nt −205 and +91 relative to the most upstream transcription start site. This predicted core promoter does not contain a noticeable TATA-box but has a cluster of Sp1 binding sites. The absence of a TATA-box is a notable feature of many housekeeping genes (37Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In TATA-less promoters, so-called initiator elements located over a transcription start site, determine basal levels of transcription. In the case of the rat caspase-3 gene, we identified a cluster of transcription start sites. The most upstream transcription start site identified is located in the middle of a Sp1 tandem. Using homology analysis tools we found that a predicted promoter for human caspase-3 shows 61.8% identity with the identified rat promoter, also lacks an apparent TATA-box, and contains multiple Sp1 and one GC binding site. Moreover, we found that the 5′-flanking sequence of the human gene demonstrates 61.7% identity with the rat gene regulatory region. Overall, these data suggest that regulatory regions of the caspase-3 gene are conserved between these mammalian species. A recent study has demonstrated that the inhibition of Sp1 and Sp3 binding by mithramycin A inhibited neuronal apoptosis induced by oxidative stress or DNA damage (36Chatterjee S. Zaman K. Ryu H. Conforto A. Ratan R.R. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that mithramycin A and its structural analogs might be useful for the treatment of neurological diseases associated with apoptosis. In the present study, we examined an effect of mithramycin A on the activity of the rat caspase-3 gene promoter. Results demonstrated that the addition of this drug leads to a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of caspase-3 promoter activity. Elevation of caspase-3 mRNA and protein levels has been reported for several models of neuronal apoptosis (12Yakovlev A.G. Knoblach S.M. Fan L. Fox G.B. Goodnight R. Faden A.I. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In this study using PC12 cells, we showed that growth factor deprivation also results in an increase in caspase-3 mRNA content and that this event is associated with the activation of the gene-specific promoter in cells undergoing apoptosis. Results of the deletion analysis demonstrated that the computer-predicted caspase-3 core promoter is necessary for the expression of the luciferase reporter gene; however, activity of the isolated core promoter is extremely low. Functional characterization of the gene 5′-flanking region revealed that major elements necessary for significant basal transcriptional activity are located between positions −1646 and −1603. The location of these elements relative to the predicted core promoter and transcription start sites suggests that they belong to an enhancer region. Computer-based analysis revealed the presence in this region of binding sites for several transcription factors including Ets-1, HLF, and CEBPB. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrated an important role for an Ets element in the regulation of the caspase-3 promoter activity. Direct binding of the Tel member of the Ets family to this regulatory element was also demonstrated in this study. However, because more than 40 identified Ets-like transcription factors share the same consensus DNA binding site, identification of a specific factor(s) responsible for control of the caspase-3 gene activity requires additional experiments. The Ets family of transcription factors is known to control the expression of genes critical for cellular proliferation, differentiation, and transformation (38Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Differential expression of Ets genes is particularly associated with embryonic development of the central nervous system (39Maroulakou I.G. Bowe D.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6432-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies have implicated Ets transcription factors in apoptosis; however, exact mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, overexpression of Ets-1 and Pu.1 induces apoptosis in various cell types (40Teruyama K. Abe M. Nakano T. Iwasaka-Yagi C. Takahashi S. Yamada S. Sato Y. J. Cell.

Hertzog P. Kola I. Wolvetang E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Tel gene has been demonstrated to play an important role in developmental apoptosis of mesenchymal and neural cells (45Wang L.C. Kuo F. Fujiwara Y. Gilliland D.G. Golub T.R. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4374-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Future studies will examine whether a role for Ets family members in neuronal development and apoptosis is based on their ability to regulate caspase-3 gene expression. We thank Drs. K. E. Krueger and V. Soldatenkov for helpful suggestions and discussion of experimental results."

V., Zhao, X., Lukyanov, S., Matz, M., Kim, S., Weissman, I., and Siebert, P. (2000) Science 290, 1585–1588). Further mutagenesis generated variants with novel and improved fluorescent properties. The mutant called AG4 exhibits only green fluorescence. The mutant, called E5up (V105A), shows complete fluorophore maturation, eventually eliminating residual green fluorescence present in DsRed. Finally, the mutant, called E57 (V105A, I161T, S197A), matures faster than DsRed as demonstrated in vitro with purified protein and in vivo with recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli andXenopus leavis. Comparative analysis of the mutants in the context of the crystal structure of DsRed suggests that mutants with free space around the fluorophore mature faster and more completely. Earlier mutagenesis of the red fluorescent protein drFP583, also called DsRed, resulted in a mutant named Fluorescent Timer (Terskikh, A., Fradkov, A., Ermakova, G., Zaraisky, A., Tan, P., Kajava, A.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4941) Google Scholar). The discovey of new fluorescent proteins from nonbioluminescent Anthozoa species (3Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar), in particular, the red-shifted fluorescent protein drFP583, also known as DsRed, opened new horizons for multicolor labeling and fluorescence resonance energy transfer applications. However, several major drawbacks, such as slow maturation and residual green fluorescence, need to be overcome for the efficient use of DsRed as an in vivo reporter. Compared with GFP, we and others (4Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11984-11989Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) noted a slow rate of fluorescence development for DsRed, which is a limiting factor for many practical applications. This difference is most pronounced at lower temperatures (close to room temperature), where GFP has maximal folding efficiency (5Kimata Y. Lim C.R. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 1997; 42: 1187-1192PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, all Anthozoa proteins studied so far mature faster at higher temperatures (≥30 °C) when compared with GFP. These temperature-dependent rates may be evolutionary adaptations to the animals' natural habitat: corals live in the warm Indo Pacific waters, while Aequorea victoria live in the cold boreal waters. The need for faster maturing DsRed mutants is especially acute in studies involving heterologous expression systems maintained at low temperature (such as Drosophila orXenopus). In addition, even after extensive maturation periods (i.e. several weeks) the wild-type DsRed protein has residual green fluorescence at 500 nm (4–5% of the major red fluorescence peak), which is a tangible source of problems in multicolor detection applications. Here we report two mutants of DsRed with improved fluorescent properties: namely, faster maturation and the absence of residual green fluorescence. Moreover, based on the crystal structure of DsRed, we formulated the “space” hypothesis to explain faster development of red fluorescence. Random mutagenesis was performed using the Diversify PCR Random Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer's protocol in conditions optimal for three to four mutations per 1000 bp. PCR products were cloned into pQE-30/BamHI/HindIII expression vector.Escherichia coli DH5-α (CLONTECH) were transformed by electroporation in 10% glycerol with ligation mixture (0.1-cm cuvette, 12.5 kV/cm, 200 Ω, 25 farads) and were grown on LB/agar plates with 100 μg/ml Amp and 0.1 mm IPTG at 37 °C overnight. Colonies (up to 2000–5000 per plate) were screened visually using a standard fluorescent microscope (Karl Zeiss) with the 31001 filter set (Chroma). The brightest colonies or colonies with different phenotypes were picked and further characterized. For protein expression, bacteria harboring the recombinant plasmid were grown to anA 600 of 0.6 in LB containing 100 μg/ml Amp, induced with 1 mm IPTG, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1× PBS buffer, and lysed by sonication. Fluorescent protein was purified at 0–4 °C from the cleared lysate using TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Excitation and emission spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer LS 50 B Luminescence Spectrometer. E. coli agar plate culture: DH5-α competent cells were transformed with plasmids pQE-E57, pQE-E5up, or pQE-DsRed, respectively. The transformants were grown overnight at 37 °C. Plates were then transferred to 4 °C for one and a half days. Two days after transformation, cells from a single colony were streaked out on a fresh LB/ampicillin plate and grown for 20–22 h at 37 °C. The pictures were taken under UV light. Microinjections of Xenopus embryos were performed as described previously (33). A number of mutants of the human codon-optimized DsRed gene (DsRed1, CLONTECH) were generated by random mutagenesis using the error-prone PCR technique (6Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). We initially characterized the mutant E5 (V105A, S197T), called Fluorescent Timer, for its ability to change the fluorescence color over time (1Terskikh A. Fradkov A. Ermakova G. Zaraisky A. Tan P. Kajava A.V. Zhao X. Lukyanov S. Matz M. Kim S. Weissman I. Siebert P. Science. 2000; 290: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The impact of each individual substitution on the fluorescent properties of E5 was further studied by splitting the mutations. Mutants each containing only one of the two substitutions present in E5, called E5up (V105A) and E5down (S197T), were obtained by site-directed PCR mutagenesis (TableI). While the “down” mutation, S197T, produced the E5 phenotype (data not shown), the “up” mutation resulted in a new phenotype. Freshly isolated E5up mutant protein fromE. coli shows a minimal green fluorescence in the first 24 h of maturation and no detectable green fluorescence after 48–72 h of maturation (Fig.1 B). Concordantly, the shoulder at 483 nm in the excitation peak observed for the wild-type protein (Fig. 1 A) and in E5 (1Terskikh A. Fradkov A. Ermakova G. Zaraisky A. Tan P. Kajava A.V. Zhao X. Lukyanov S. Matz M. Kim S. Weissman I. Siebert P. Science. 2000; 290: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) was diminished in fully matured E5up protein (Fig. 1 B) (1Terskikh A. Fradkov A. Ermakova G. Zaraisky A. Tan P. Kajava A.V. Zhao X. Lukyanov S. Matz M. Kim S. Weissman I. Siebert P. Science. 2000; 290: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 3Matz M.V.

In addition, E. coli expressing E5up showed increased brightness of red fluorescent colonies in comparison with those expressing wild-type DsRed (Fig. 2 B). Position 105 mutated in E5up corresponds to position 106, occupied by tyrosine in GFP. Molecular modeling shows that, unlike GFP, DsRed has bulky amino acids surrounding position Val105 (3Matz M.V.

Presumably, the substitution of a bulky aliphatic valine for a more compact alanine resulted in relaxation of the overall structure, which facilitates complete maturation of the red fluorophore (Fig.3).Table ISummary of DsRed mutantsCloneMutationsRedt 1/21-aAs measured in vitro; green fluorescence λem = 500 nm, red fluorescence λem = 580 nm.Residual green fluorescence1-aAs measured in vitro; green fluorescence λem = 500 nm, red fluorescence λem = 580 nm.DescriptionhDsRedWild-type9–105% after 24 hSlow maturationE51-bGeneration and properties of the Fluorescence Timer protein were described.V105A, S197T9–1014% after 43 h, 10% after few daysFluorescent TimerE5upV105A9–103% after 24 h, 0% after several daysNo residual green fluorescenceE57V105A, I161T, S197A3–45% after 8 h, 4% after 24 hFast maturationAG4V71M, V105A, S197T1.5100% green at all timesGreen only, no detectable red fluorescenceFluorescence data measured for purified proteins following the course of in vitro maturation at 37 °C.1-a As measured in vitro; green fluorescence λem = 500 nm, red fluorescence λem = 580 nm.1-b Generation and properties of the Fluorescence Timer protein were described.

To find faster maturating mutants, we used the E5 mutant as a template for a second round of random mutagenesis. We isolated a mutant named E57, which developed bright red fluorescence in bacteria much faster than wild-type and E5 did. As early as after overnight incubation colonies of E. coli transformants expressing E57 developed an intense pink hue when observed at normal daylight. In contrast, colonies expressing wild-type DsRed needed another 16–24 h at room temperature to show color (data not shown). Compared with E5, mutant E57 differs from the former at two amino acid positions, namely, I161T and T197A (Table I). Position 161 in DsRed corresponds to position 165 in GFP. Although no mutant variants of GFP were isolated for this particular position, several reported mutations map to this region (I167T/V and V163A) leading to improved brightness or better folding (7Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12501-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 8Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat.

Interestingly, the mutation T197A which seems to enhance chromophore maturation is the second observed mutation in position 197 (occupied by serine in wild-type protein and threonine in E5). The excitation spectrum of freshly isolated E57 mutant protein showed a diminished shoulder at 483 nm and less green fluorescence emission compared with wild-type DsRed (Fig. 1, C andA). As with E5up, expression of E57 resulted in considerably brighter colonies when expressed in E. coli than wild-type DsRed (Fig. 2 B). In vitro maturation kinetics of E57, E5up, and wt DsRed were studied using the freshly purified proteins. The E57 mutant developed its fluorescence faster than the wild-type DsRed and E5up protein (Fig. 2 A). To compare the speed of fluorescent signal development between E57 and wt DsRed in a whole organism, mRNAs encoding corresponding proteins were micro-injected into Xenopus blastocytes at the two blastomeres stage. Approximately 15 h later at the early neurula stage, we used fluorescence microscopy to compare the fluorescence intensities. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the E57 mutant developed fluorescence much faster than that of wt DsRed. Unexpectedly, we did not observe a faster onset of red fluorescence upon transient transfection in HEK 293 cells, suggesting that fluorescence development in this case was controlled by a cell-specific rate-limiting step (data not shown). Remarkably, during screening we identified several mutants exhibiting intense green fluorescence. One of them, AG4 (Table I), showed only bright green fluorescence and had no detectable red fluorescence at any time (Fig. 1 D). Substitution V71M in AG4, which completely abrogates red fluorescence, maps in the α-helical region inside the β-can (Fig. 3). The residue 71 is located close to the fluorophore, and according to the crystal structure, it appears to be tightly packed against the surrounding bulky side chains of amino acids Phe118, Phe94, and Tyr72 (10Yarbrough D. Wachter R.M. Kallio K. Matz M.V. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thus, most probably, introducing a larger side chain by substituting methionine for valine produced substantial distortion of the fluorophore environment, preventing complete maturation of the red fluorophore. Although at first glance the generation of yet another green fluorescent protein may not seem to be of any advantage, it may be used as an ideal counterpart for DsRed (or its red-emitting mutants) in multicolor labeling applications. Because of the minimal sequence differences, it assures similar behavior in cells (i.e.nonspecific accumulation, precipitation, and interaction with cellular components). Thus, any observed difference in behavior of two proteins, one tagged by red-emitting variant of DsRed and another by AG4, should be unequivocally attributed to the proteins themselves and not to the difference of tags. Similar to DsRed AG4 is an obligate tetramer. 2A. V. Terskikh, unpublished observation. Thus, one should be careful to perform the control experiment with AG4 in a different cell, to avoid a potential problem of producing mixed tetramers of DsRed and AG4. The three-dimensional structure of wild-type DsRed (10Yarbrough D. Wachter R.M. Kallio K. Matz M.V. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 11Wall M.A. Socolich M. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct.

After modeling and analysis of the mutants we predict that the volume of space occupied by the side chain in position 161 may affect the efficiency of the green-to-red maturation. In the course of this reaction, additional atoms of the central helix are involved into the rigid and flat moiety of the fluorophore. The comparative analysis of the DsRed and GFP structures shows that movement of the rigid fluorophore moiety relative to the helix is necessary for the maturation of the DsRed fluorophore (Fig.3). Therefore, close packing of the residues that surround the fluorophore can hamper the reaction. The observed effect of I161T substitution from a bulky residue to a small residue agrees with this hypothesis. Interestingly, the corresponding position in GFP is occupied by an even bulkier side chain, that of phenylalanine (position 165 in GFP corresponds to position 161 in DsRed). Structural analysis of position 197 also supports our hypothesis that the DsRed fluorophore matures more rapidly, when its immediate environment within the folded protein is kept open and unencumbered by bulky side chains. Indeed, serine in position 197 of the wild-type DsRed protein is in direct contact with the phenolic moiety of the fluorophore (Fig. 4). Furthermore, our comparative analysis of the structures of GFP and DsRed shows that the fluorophore of DsRed is closer to the residue in position 197 (Fig. 3). It is reasonable to suggest that the kinetic barrier for the maturation reaction decreases in proportion to the volume of empty space near residue 197. Indeed, the E57 mutant, which has the fastest known maturation rate, has the large residue serine replaced by the smaller residue alanine in position 197. Another confirmation comes from the recent report where a serine to tyrosine substitution in position 197 of DsRed was described (12Verkhusha V.V. Otsuna H. Awasaki T. Oda H. Tsukita S. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29621-29624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In accordance with our theory, replacement of serine with the bigger tyrosine residue did not increase the rate of maturation; it affected only the overall folding efficiency (12Verkhusha V.V. Otsuna H. Awasaki T. Oda H. Tsukita S. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29621-29624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Slow maturation of wild-type DsRed, residual green fluorescence, and lower brightness compared with GFP were pointed out as the major limitations for its use as a fluorescent reporter (13Zacharias D.A. Gross L.A. Baird G.S. Hoffman R.C. Baldridge K.K. Tsien R.Y. 11th International Symposium on Bioluminescence and Chemolum, September 6–10, Monterey, CA.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) no mutants of DsRed protein with accelerated fluorescence development were reported. Here we describe three mutants of DsRed: E57 with improved maturation kinetics, E5up with eliminated residual green fluorescence, and AG4 with only green fluorescence but no detectable red fluorescence. Serendipitous selection of the E5 variant (1Terskikh A. Fradkov A. Ermakova G. Zaraisky A. Tan P. Kajava A.V. Zhao X. Lukyanov S. Matz M. Kim S. Weissman I. Siebert P. Science. 2000; 290: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) for the second round of mutagenesis was a key for the generation of improved red fluorescent proteins. Indeed, the rate of random mutagenesis used in this study (about 1 mutation per 1 kb) makes it unlikely, in the case of E57, to generate all three mutations simultaneously. Precise determination of the relative brightness and quantum yield of wild-type DsRed was somewhat confusing with large discrepancies reported by various investigators (3Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 4Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl.

The generation of these data depend upon many different factors: source of the protein, maturation conditions, protein purity, reference standard for relative quantum yield calculations, protein concentration, and buffer system. 3A. P. Savitsky, personal communication. It remains to be elucidated whether the increased fluorescence signal intensity obtained by expressing E5up and E57 in cells or whole organisms is due to a greater quantity of fluorescent protein, an increased brightness of the chromophore, or both. We believe that the direct in vivocomparison of protein performance in different model systems on the cellular and whole organism levels as shown in this work is more meaningful for practical applications than in vitrogenerated spectrofluorometric data. Eventually, the possibility of earlier detection of gene expression, increased fluorescence signal, and higher signal-to-noise ratio should be the most objective criteria for the usefulness of the new mutants as reporters for various biological applications. Finally, based on the analysis of the three-dimensional structure of DsRed, we formulated the hypothesis where the space availability around the fluorophore is crucial for fast and complete maturation. Recently another fast maturing mutant of the DsRed protein was described (18Bevis B.G. Glick B.S. Nature Biotechnology. 2002; 20: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).

Therefore, extracellular cholesterol transport in the CNS is mediated by its own lipoprotein system, consisting mainly of the particles equivalent to plasma HDL (1Roheim P.S. Carey M. Forte T. Vega G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4646-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The main apolipoproteins are apoE produced by astrocytes (2Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Foss D. Mahley R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), microglias (3Nakai M. Kawamata T. Taniguchi T. Maeda K. Tanaka C. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 211: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and apoA-I from an unknown source but reportedly secreted by brain endothelial cells (4Weiler-Guttler H. Sommerfeldt M.

The astrocytes were shown to generate HDL, not only with endogenously synthesized apoE but also with exogenous apoE and apoA-I (5Ito J. Zhang L.Y. Asai M. Yokoyama S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The apolipoprotein-cell interaction that generates HDL is common for many somatic cells from various origins and is distinct from the diffusion-mediated cholesterol efflux from the cell surface (6Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The reaction is a main source of plasma lipoprotein (7Tsujita M. Tomimoto S. Okumura-Noji K. Okazaki M. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and is also one of the major pathways for cholesterol release from the cells (8Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of HDL with cellular phospholipid seems to require a cellular interaction site with apolipoprotein. An intracellular cholesterol trafficking system linked to such interaction is responsible for incorporation of cholesterol into the HDL (9Li Q. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26216-26223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Li Q. Tsujita M. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12045-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutations in the ABCA1 transporter protein were identified in patients with plasma HDL deficiency who lack the ability to generate HDL by this reaction (11Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M.

A specific intracellular cholesterol transport system is important to make the HDL cholesterol-rich. In macrophages and smooth muscle cells, protein kinase C was shown to be involved in this trafficking (9Li Q. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26216-26223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Li Q. Tsujita M. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12045-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the mechanism for generation of HDL in somatic cells is different from that for the HDL assembly in the CNS. There are, however, a few unique findings concerning HDL generation by CNS cells. We have reported in a previous study (5Ito J. Zhang L.Y. Asai M. Yokoyama S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that the cultured rat astrocytes produce cholesterol-poor and phosphatidylcholine-rich HDL with exogenous apoA-I, whereas the HDL formed with endogenous apoE is cholesterol-rich. Digestion of sphingomyelin with the extracellular enzyme enhances the exogenous apoA-I-mediated cholesterol release to make the HDL cholesterol-rich, but not the endogenous apoE-mediated pathway (14Ito J. Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result indicated that the behavior of cholesterol molecules in the astrocytes upon HDL assembly with extracellular apolipoprotein is influenced by interaction with sphingomyelin. Thus, intracellular trafficking of cholesterol to link to the exogenous apoA-I-mediated cholesterol release and assembly of HDL might undergo the restriction by sphingomyelin in these cells. The plasma membrane organizes unique cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich domains called rafts or caveolae (15Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Such domains have indeed been implicated as sites where cellular cholesterol might be leaving the cells (14Ito J. Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1, a 22-kDa protein, is one of the major components of rafts/caveolae that holds a high affinity for cholesterol and sphingomyelin molecules (15Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 17Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This protein has been shown to be involved in intracellular cholesterol trafficking. It directly binds to cholesterol (18Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 19Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol.

Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). It is also translocated between caveolae and the endoplasmic reticulum by cholesterol oxidation and its removal (21Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar,22Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 reportedly forms a chaperone complex with heat-shock protein and cholesterol in cytosol to transport newly synthesized cholesterol (19Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25595-25599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A more specific role for this protein was demonstrated in the cholesterol transport system to incorporate cholesterol molecules into the HDL generated by apolipoprotein-cell interaction (24Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25Arakawa R. Abe-Dohmae S. Asai M. Ito J. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1952-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we investigated the mechanism by which caveolin-1 mediates cholesterol trafficking to the cellular surface stimulated by the apolipoprotein-cell interaction to generate HDL in rat astrocytes. We discovered that newly synthesized cholesterol was translocated to the cytosol fraction prior to its appearance in the generated HDL, apparently forming a complex with phospholipid accompanied by the increase of caveolin-1 in the cytosol. ApoA-I was isolated from freshly prepared human HDL by delipidation and anion-exchange chromatography according to a previously described method (26Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem. 1982; 91: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were prepared from the brain of day-17 Wistar rat fetus according to the method previously described (5Ito J.

Brain Res. 1984; 301: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded and cultured in 10% fetal calf serum/F-10 medium for 1 week. The rat astrocytes at the confluent stage were pulse-labeled with [3H]acetic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 or 120 min and chased with a medium containing 1 mm cold acetic acid and 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Alternatively, cellular cholesterol was labeled by incubating with low-density lipoprotein containing [3H]cholesteryl ester for 24 h as previously described (5Ito J. Zhang L.Y. Asai M. Yokoyama S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cytosol of rat astrocytes was prepared according to the method of Thom et al. (29Thom D. Powell A.J. Lloyd C.W. Rees D.A. Biochem. J. 1977; 168: 187-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells pretreated with or without apoA-I in F-10 medium containing 0.02% BSA were harvested with a rubber policeman after washing with 53.6 mm sodium phosphate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 5.5 mmglucose (buffer A) four times. The cell pellet from centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 10 min was treated with cold extract solution composed of 0.02 m boric acid, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmbenzamidine, pH 10.0, for 15 min with 25 agitations for 10 s every 5 min. The suspension was neutralized with 0.5 n HCl and was then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. After removal of nuclei and cell debris, the suspension was centrifuged at 300,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain supernatant as the cytosol fraction. For standard analysis, the cytosol (9 ml) was overlayered on top of the sucrose solutions with a density of 1.20 g/ml (bottom, 8 ml) and of 1.07 g/ml (middle, 8 ml) and centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 48 h at 4 °C by using a Hitachi RP50T rotor. The solution in the centrifuged tube was collected from the bottom as 12 fractions (8Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cytosol fraction (7 ml) was overlayered on the sucrose solution of 1.18 g/ml (18 ml) and centrifuged under the same conditions in order to achieve better separation in the fractions of higher density. After cellular lipid was labeled, lipid was extracted from the whole cell with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) and from various cell fractions and culture medium with chloroform/methanol (2:1). Extraction efficiency of the lipid was estimated as 0.895 ± 0.015 and 0.926 ± 0.015 from the cell and its fractions and from the medium, respectively, by using internal standards. The extract was separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and radioactivity in each fraction, such as cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin, was determined (5Ito J. Zhang L.Y. Asai M. Yokoyama S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For mass assay, total and free cholesterol and triglyceride were directly determined by enzymatic assay methods. For choline phospholipid, the extracted lipid was separated by TLC with a developing solvent of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:2) and was then enzymatically determined. Phosphatidylcholine (egg, Avanti Polar Lipids, 0–20 μg/spot) and sphingomyelin (bovine brain, Sigma-Aldrich, 0–10 μg/spot) were applied and separated on the same plate as the standards, for chromatography and quantitative assay. Fractions were scraped, and lipid was extracted from each sample with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol solution (2:1, v/v) five times for enzymatic assay of choline phospholipid (5Ito J. Zhang L.Y. Asai M. Yokoyama S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2362-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis of cytosol, protein was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid from the cytosol aliquot (700 μl) of rat astrocytes and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. Protein was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and visualized by an immunoblotting technique using rabbit anti-caveolin 1 (N-20) and goat anti-histone H1 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-cyclophilin A antibody (Affinity BioReagents), mouse anti-EEA1, anti-GM130, anti-Bip/GRP78, anti-heat-shock proteins (HSP) 70, 90, and 110, and anti-flotillin 1 monoclonal antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories). For analysis of activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP), its increase in the nuclear extracts was detected as described (30Sato R. Miyamoto W. Inoue J. Terada T. Imanaka T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellet by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min was strongly agitated by vortexing for 10s times 25, repeating four times with a 5-min interval in between, in a cold extract solution of 0.02 mboric acid, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 m benzamidine, pH 10.0. The suspension was neutralized with 0.5 n HCl and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min in order to pellet the crude nuclear fraction. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against recombinant human SREBP2 (1–481) with a His tag (RS004) (30Sato R. Miyamoto W. Inoue J. Terada T. Imanaka T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and recombinant SREBP1 (1–487) with a His tag (RS005) and used for detecting the mature SREBPs in the nuclear fractions (30Sato R. Miyamoto W. Inoue J. Terada T. Imanaka T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane fraction was treated in 1% Triton X-100, and the insoluble fraction was obtained as described previously (14Ito J. Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sample solution was made to 2 ml in 30% sucrose, overlayered by 1.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 90,000 rpm for 1 h in a Hitachi CS 120GX centrifuge using a S100AT6 rotor. Twelve fractions were collected from the bottom, and each fraction was analyzed for cholesterol content and protein by enzymatic measurement and for caveolin-1 and flotillin 1 by immunoblotting. The lipid fraction of the cytosol was dialyzed against 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9 at 4 °C overnight with a formvar-coated grid in the solution. The specimen adsorbed on the grid was negatively stained with 0.5% uranium acetate and examined in a Hitachi 7100 electron microscope. The cells were metabolically pulse-labeled by incubating with [3H]acetate for 30 min or 120 min and then incubated with apoA-I. Radioactivities in cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin were monitored in the cytosol and membrane fractions. After 30 min of pulse-labeling, the radioactivity profile of cholesterol in the cytosol fraction demonstrated that the transient increase has a peak at 90 min in the apoA-I-treated astrocytes (Fig.1 A). On the other hand, the increase of cholesterol radioactivity in the membrane fraction started with a 90-min incubation and continued to 120 min or longer (Fig.1 B). The radioactivity profile of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in the cytosol of the apoA-I-stimulated cells also showed a peak at 90 min simultaneously with cholesterol when pulse-labeled for 120 min (Fig. 1, C–E). Biosyntheses of cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin were monitored by incorporation of [3H]acetate into each lipid in the cell for 120 min after preincubation with apoA-I for various periods of time. Synthesis was stimulated when the apoA-I treatment was longer than 90 min (Fig.1, F–H). The release of labeled cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin into the medium from pulse-labeled cells was increased when the apoA-I pretreatment was longer than 120 min (Fig. 2). These findings indicate that when the cells interact with apoA-I, translocation of cholesterol and phospholipid to the cytosol takes place prior to incorporation of these lipids into HDL and prior to the increase of lipid biosynthesis.Figure 2Release by apoA-I of newly synthesized lipid from rat astrocytes. Rat astrocytes were pulse-labeled with 40 μCi/ml [3H]acetate for 120 min. The cells were immediately washed, chased, and treated with (closed circles) or without (open circles) apoA-I (5 μg/ml) for the indicated time. Lipid was extracted from the conditioned medium after the removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 h. Radioactivity was counted in cholesterol (A,chol), phosphatidylcholine (B, pc), and sphingomyelin (C, spm) after separation by TLC.

When the cells pulse-labeled for 120 min were incubated with apoA-I, only a low lipid count was detected in fractions 3–6 at around 1.12 g/ml (at 60 min) without a significant difference with or without apoA-I. At 90 min, a substantial increase in the count was induced by apoA-I in cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin at the same position of density (Fig.3, B, D, andF). Fractions 3–6 with a cytosol density of 1.09–1.16 g/ml were collected and examined with an electron microscope using a negative-staining technique. As shown in Fig.4, somewhat amorphous lipid particles were observed regardless of the incubation with and without apoA-I. The average diameters of the particles were 17.7 ± 7.0 nm and 17.1 ± 6.8 nm with and without apoA-I, respectively. This cytosol fraction was further analyzed for chemical composition of lipid (TableI). Major lipid components were phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol, but a small amount of triglyceride was also detected. The results show that small lipid particles are present in the cytosol, regardless of the stimulation by apoA-I. Translocation of the newly synthesized lipid to these particles was induced by the reaction to extracellular apoA-I. The lipid particles were likely to be complexed with protein as judged by the density.Figure 4Negatively stained electron micrograph of the lipid fraction isolated from the cytosol. The lipid fraction of the cytosol was prepared by two-step ultracentrifugation. The cytosol fraction prepared from the cells treated with (5 μg/ml) and without apoA-I for 90 min was overlaid on the sucrose solutions of density 1.20 g/ml (bottom) and 1.07 g/ml (middle) and centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 48 h. The fraction of the density 1.09–1.16 g/ml was recovered, adjusted to 1.18 g/ml with sucrose, and centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 48 h by using an RP55T rotor (Hitachi). The top fraction (500 μl) was recovered and dialyzed against 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9 at 4 °C overnight with a formvar-coated grid in the solution. The specimen adsorbed on the grid was negatively stained with 0.5% uranium acetate and examined in a Hitachi 7100 electron microscope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ILipid Composition of the Lipid-containing Cytosol FractionPC1-aPC, phosphatidylcholine.SPM1-bSPM, sphingomyelin.FC1-cFC, free cholesterol.CE1-dCE, cholesteryl ester.TG1-eTG, triglyceride.apoA-I(−)4.93 ± 1.250.87 ± 0.220.70 ± 0.17ND1-fND, not detected.0.54 ± 0.07apoA-I(+)5.63 ± 0.430.93 ± 0.070.83 ± 0.09ND0.29 ± 0.08The fraction was isolated as the density 1.09–1.16 g/ml and then as a floating fraction in the density 1.18 g/ml from the cytosol of the astrocytes preincubated with and without apoA-I (5 μg/ml) for 90 min.

Fig. 5 demonstrates the increase of the activated SREBP1 and SREBP2 in the nuclear fraction by apoA-I. SREBP1 increased somewhat earlier than SREBP2. Translocation of newly synthesized cholesterol is thus associated with stimulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and other sterol-relating metabolic pathways via the SREBP-mediated mechanism. The cytosol preparation was analyzed for protein in density gradient ultracentrifugation (Fig. 6). Regardless of the stimulation by apoA-I, caveolin-1 and cyclophilin A were recovered in the fractions with densities of 1.103–1.148 g/ml (Fig. 6 A), equivalent to those of lipid (Fig. 3) and were separated from Bip/GRP78 (an endoplasmic reticulum marker protein). The increase of caveolin-1, but not cyclophilin A, was demonstrated in these fractions by stimulation of the cells with apoA-I (Fig.6 A). Cytosolic caveolin-1 (1.102–1.146 g/ml) was also separated from organelle membrane marker proteins EEA1 (an early endosome marker protein) and GM130 (a Golgi apparatus protein) (Fig. 6 B). Heat-shock proteins, HSP 70, 90, and 110 were found in the fractions with higher density. A time-dependent increase of caveolin-1 in the cytosol was synchronized with the translocation of the lipids, reaching a maximum at 60–90 min, whereas cyclophilin A did not show a time-dependent change (Fig. 6 C). To examine whether the cytosol particles identified are distinct from the DRM fraction rich in caveolin-1, DRM and the cytosol particles were directly compared (Fig. 7). The density range of DRM was 1.02–1.10 g/ml where the main protein peak, cholesterol, caveolin-1, and flotillin (another DRM marker) were simultaneously recovered. The cytosol lipid particles were recovered at 1.10–1.16 g/ml, with caveolin-1 separated from the main cytosol protein peak (Fig. 7, A and B). The lipid particles in the cytosol were sensitive to Triton X-100, apparently with loss of their original integrated structure, suggesting that the particles were not derived from the DRM domain of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7 C). When Cs-A, a ligand to cyclophilin proteins, was added to the cells, the increase of caveolin-1 in the cytosol by apoA-I was completely suppressed (Fig.8 A). The effects of Cs-A were also examined with regard to cholesterol synthesis, its translocation into the cytosol, and lipid release into the medium by apoA-I. As demonstrated in Fig. 8 B, all of the intracellular reactions induced by apoA-I were completely inhibited by Cs-A, and the cholesterol release was substantially suppressed. The results thus suggested that the apoA-I-mediated intracellular events are seemingly related to cholesterol transport to the HDL assembly site. The results in rat astrocytes are summarized in the following statements. 1) ApoA-I causes translocation of newly synthesized cholesterol and phospholipid to the cytosol to form the lipid-protein complex particles (density of 1.09–1.16 g/ml) prior to their appearance in the HDL assembled by apoA-I and to the increase of their biosynthesis. 2) ApoA-I also induces the increase of caveolin-1 in the cytosol that associates with lipid to form a density peak of 1.10–1.15 g/ml. 3) Cyclophilin A also associates with lipid in the cytosol found in the fractions with roughly similar density to caveolin-1, and its inhibitor Cs-A suppressed all of the apoA-I-mediated reactions including the enhancement of cholesterol biosynthesis, its translocation to the cytosol, and its incorporation into the generated HDL, as well as the appearance of caveolin-1 in the cytosol. The results are thus consistent with the hypothesis that apoA-I stimulates translocation of the newly synthesized lipids to the cytosol as an initial event in cholesterol trafficking for the assembly of HDL. The translocated lipids to the cytosol appear to form particles having a density of the lipid-protein complex. Caveolin-1 and cyclophilin A also seem to associate with lipid in the cytosol, being distinct from the endosome and the microsome derived from the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus. EEA1, GM130, and Bip/GRP78 were recovered in higher density fractions than the lipid-protein complex particles as well as the HSPs (Fig. 6). It is also obvious that the particles are not derived from the DRM domain or caveolae because of their sensitivity to Triton X-100 (Fig. 7). Biosynthesis of cholesterol and phospholipids appears to be enhanced after this translocation, presumably triggered by the decrease of cholesterol in the SREBP-sensitive compartment. The labeled lipids appear in the HDL extracellularly assembled by apoA-I after their translocation into the cytosol. Because caveolin-1 has been proposed to mediate intracellular cholesterol transport to the cellular surface, which is linked to cholesterol release by apoA-I, it is conceivable that this particle may function to carry cholesterol and other lipids to the cell surface site where HDL assembly takes place. It has been reported that the movement of newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane is accompanied by the formation of the protein complex composed of caveolin-1, cyclophilin A, cyclophilin 40, and heat-shock protein 56 in the cytosol of NIH 3T3 cells and also lymphoid cell line L1210-JF transfected by caveolin-1 (23Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the case of rat astrocytes, however, cyclophilin 40 was recovered in the membrane fraction and the higher density protein fraction of the cytosol, but not in the lipid-caveolin-1 fraction. 2J. Ito and S. Yokoyama, unpublished data. Whereas such a proposed protein complex reportedly contains only cholesterol as a lipid component, the lipid-protein complexed particles identified in the rat astrocyte cytosol in this study contained cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin. ApoA-I induced incorporation of newly synthesized cholesterol and phospholipid into these particles. Although both caveolin-1 and cyclophilin A seem to be associated with these particles in a density gradient analysis, an anti-caveolin-1 antibody failed to coprecipitate cyclophilin A with caveolin 1 from the rat astrocytes cytosol. 2J. Ito and S. Yokoyama, unpublished data. Intracellular cholesterol distribution has been shown to be greatly dependent on the function of caveolin-1 and caveolae. Expression of caveolin-1 is closely related to cellular cholesterol levels (24Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,31Bist A. Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10693-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Exposure of human fibroblasts to cholesterol oxidase rapidly allows caveolin-1 to redistribute from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum and then to the Golgi complex (21Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized cholesterol was first moved from the endoplasmic reticulum to caveolae linked to the caveolin-1 movement and then to the noncaveolae domain of the plasma membrane (32Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Cholesterol transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane is greatly enhanced in caveolin-1-transfected lymphocytes (23Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of caveolin-1 reduced the incorporation of cholesterol into HDL assembled by the cell-apoA-I interaction (24Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 25Arakawa R. Abe-Dohmae S. Asai M. Ito J. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1952-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it may not be irrelevant to conceive that the cytosolic caveolin-lipid complex in rat astrocytes may function as a vehicle for transport of cholesterol and phospholipid from the endoplasmic reticulum to the DRM domain of the plasma membrane. ABCA1 plays a key role in the apolipoprotein-mediated HDL assembly (11Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M. Zhang L.H. Roomp K. van Dam M. Yu L. Brewer C. Collins J.A. Molhuizen H.O. Loubser O.

Physical interaction of apolipoprotein with the cell surface seems to require ABCA1 (33Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 34Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol.

Abe-Dohmae S. Asai M. Ito J. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1952-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol enrichment in the HDL, thus generated, is regulated in a relatively independent manner from the assembly of HDL particles (9Li Q. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26216-26223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and caveolin-1 seems involved in this step (25Arakawa R. Abe-Dohmae S. Asai M. Ito J. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1952-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This part is also dependent on sphingomyelin-cholesterol interaction in DRM in astrocytes (14Ito J. Nagayasu Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 894-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) so that intracellular cholesterol transport by caveolin-1 may enrich this domain with cholesterol to lead to its incorporation into the HDL. More studies are required to prove this hypothesis. Anderson and co-workers (37Liu P. Li W.P. Machleidt T. Anderson R.G. Nat. Cell Bio. 1999; 1: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have reported that exocrine cells that synthesize both apoA-I and apoE secreted caveolin-1 along with these apolipoproteins as a lipoprotein particle. They have suggested that caveolin-1 with apolipoproteins are present as a lipoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartment and are transported in the secretory pathway. In contrast, neither caveolin-1 was detected in the HDL fraction in the medium of the rat astrocytes pretreated with apoA-I nor was endogenous apoE in the caveolin-lipid complex of the cytosol fraction of the rat astrocytes. Therefore, cholesterol trafficking for its release in the HDL assembly reaction with extracellular apolipoprotein seems essentially different from what was observed in the exocrine cells. The absence of apoE in the cytosolic fraction excludes the possibility that the HDL particles in the secretory pathway, if any, contaminated the isolated fraction. More recently, the same group demonstrated the presence of caveolin-1 and cyclophilin A in an HDL density fraction of the cytosol of human fibroblasts (38Li W.P. Liu P. Pilcher B.K. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1397-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so the present findings may not be specific for astrocytes but rather more generally applicable for the HDL assembly system by apolipoprotein and cellular lipid. The results of inhibition of the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol release and other cellular reactions by Cs-A support the hypothesis that the translocation of lipid and caveolin-1 to the cytosol is associated with lipid release and HDL assembly by apoA-I. The results also suggest that the reactions are dependent on the function of cyclophilin proteins. We thank Michiyo Asai for technical assistance, especially for preparation of apoA-I."

Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). More than two dozen MMPs have been identified so far. Based on their substrate specificities they can be divided into a number of groups, which include collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, and membrane-type MMPs. The MMPs are secreted as pro-enzymes and can only be activated by cleavage of a short peptide from their N-terminal ends by plasmin as well as by one of their own members, membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MMP-1) (2Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 1999; 107: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). MMP activity is tightly coordinated at several levels including transcriptional regulation, activation of latent zymogen, and interaction with endogenous inhibitors (1Matrisian L.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Brown P.D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 52: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MMP-2 (gelatinase A, type IV collagenase) is one of the MMP members that has been extensively studied and has been found to play an important role in increasing smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration, tissue remodeling, and tumor metastasis (4Li Y.Y. McTiernan C.F. Feldman A.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 46: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 5Curran S. Murray G.I. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 1621-1630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In studying occlusive vascular disease, much attention has been focused on increased MMP-2 expression and its ability to promote VSMC migration to the intima from the original media after either inflammatory or mechanical injury to the vascular wall (6Newby A.C. Southgate K.M. Davies M. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1994; 89: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zempo N. Kenagy R.D. Au Y.P. Bendeck M. Clowes M.M. Reidy M.A. Clowes A.W. J. Vasc. Surg. 1994; 20: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In normal vessels, most of the VSMC reside in the media and are embedded in and also immobilized by the ECM. During VSMC migration, the surrounding ECM barriers must first be degraded and removed by MMPs. MMP-2 is one of the major ECM-degrading proteases and was shown specifically to degrade basement membrane, which consists mainly of collagen type IV, laminin, and proteoglycans (8Knox J.B. Sukhova G.K. Whittemore A.D. Libby P. Circulation. 1997; 95: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 9Li Z. Li L. Zielke H.R. Cheng L. Xiao R. Crow M.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Froehlich J. Lakatta E.G. Am J Pathol. 1996; 148: 121-128PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-2 is expressed abundantly in atherosclerotic and restenotic lesions, and the inhibition of its activity by synthetic compounds greatly reduces neointima formation (10George S.J. Johnson J.L. Angelini G.D. Jeremy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2500-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MMP-2 expression in VSMC is up-regulated by vascular injury and low blood flow conditions but is down-regulated by cellular differentiation and high blood flow (11Bassiouny H.S. Song R.H. Hong X.F. Singh A. Kocharyan H. Glagov S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this regulation, however, is unclear. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a 38-kD immediate early gene product and belongs to a recently described and structurally related CCN (CTGF/Cyr16/Nov) gene family. CTGF is suggested to play an important role in the ECM remodeling that occurs in normal physiological processes such as embryogenesis, implantation, and wound healing as well as in fibrosis and scarring (see review in Ref. 12Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). However, recent advances have shown that CTGF is involved in diverse autocrine or paracrine actions in many cell types such as vascular endothelial cells, epithelial cells, neuronal cells, VSMC, and cells of supportive skeletal tissues (see review in Ref. 13Moussad E.E. Brigstock D.R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 276-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). We previously found that CTGF promotes VSMC proliferation, migration, and production of ECM in tissue culture (14Fan W.H. Pech M. Karnovsky M.J. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that CTGF also increases the activity of MMP-2 in VSMC conditioned medium, and this increase is the result of rising level of MMP-2 mRNA. The mRNA increase can be blocked by cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis is required for this effect. We further found that CTGF has no major effects on either tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) or MMP-9. Moreover, the CTGF regulation on MMP-2 seems to be mediated by the transcription factor AP-2. Because MMP-2 is intimately involved in promoting VSMC migration during neointima formation, our results suggest that CTGF-promoted VSMC migration is mediated by MMP-2. Cell Culture, CTGF Plasmid, and Other Reagents—VSMC were isolated from abdominal aortas of Sprague-Dawley rats as described (15Pukac L.A. Hirsch G.M. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Choay J. Karnovsky M.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 139: 1501-1509PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 20% fetal calf serum/RPMI with penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells between passages 7 and 13 were used in our experiments. CTGF expression plasmid construction and cell transfection methods were described previously (14Fan W.H. Pech M. Karnovsky M.J. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recombinant CTGF protein and anti-CTGF antibody were gifts from Dr. Michael Pech (Hoffmann-La Roche) and were described previously (14Fan W.H. Pech M. Karnovsky M.J. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). MMP-2 cDNA probe was a gift from Dr. Jo Louise Seltzer of Washington University (St. Louis, MO). Anti-MMP-2 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. MMP-2 activity in conditioned media was determined by zymography. For each sample 30 μl of conditioned media were loaded onto a precast SDS-PAGE containing 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 3 h and incubated at 37 °C in low-salt collagenase buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris, 0.2 mol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/ liter anhydrous CaCl2, and 0.02% Brij detergent. The gels were subsequently stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue (G-250), destained with 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid, and incubated in 30% methanol and 5% glycerol. They were dried between cellophane sheets. Areas of gelatinase activity appeared as nonstaining bands on the gels. Gelatinolytic bands at 92, 72, and 62 kDa represent latent MMP-2, latent MMP-9, and active MMP-2 activity, respectively. The zymography gels were scanned and analyzed densitometrically using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant software. The image density for each gelatinolytic band was recorded and reported in volume units of pixel intensity × mm2. Each value was normalized against the protein concentration and reported as gelatinase activity. Cells were lysed in RNAzolTM, and total RNA was isolated according to the vendor's instructions. RNA samples were quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm. 20 μg of RNA was separated on a 1% agarose, 1.1 m formaldehyde gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The hybridization was carried out using 32P-labeled MMP-2 and GAPDH probes. GAPDH was used as a control to normalize RNA loading. The hybridization buffer and conditions used in our experiments were: 2× Denhardt's, 50% formamide, 100 μl/ml herring sperm DNA, and 0.25% SDS at 42 °C incubation for 12 h. MMP-2 mRNA levels were also quantitated by densitometry of the MMP-2 signals and normalized to the GAPDH levels. The sequences of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (ODN) against AP-2 used in this study were: 5′-CGTCAATTTCCAAAGCAT TTTCATGGATCGG-3′ (−13 to +18 of the AP-2 sequence). The control oligonucleotide, 5′-CAAAGTCTTGCAT TATTCGGTCATAATGGCC-3′, consisted of similar nucleotides with scrambled sequences. For RT-PCR amplification of AP-2 mRNA, primers 5-CCC AAG CCA TAG CTC GAG ACT C-3′ and 5-GAA GTC ACA GAT TTG GGA GGG A-3′ were used, resulting in a 531-bp fragment spanning residues 66–597 of the cDNA. Purified ODNs were introduced into VSMC cells using a cationic liposome reagent, Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Briefly, the cells were incubated at 37 °C until they reached confluency. For each transfection, ODNs were mixed with Lipofectin reagent in serum-free medium and overlaid onto the cells that had been rinsed with serum-free medium. The final concentration of ODNs was 100 μm; 2 μg of Lipofectin was added to each well of a 6-multi-well plate. The cells were incubated overnight. Transfection efficiency was assayed and routinely found to be more than 50%. This was done by co-transfecting a β-galactosidase plasmid (pRSV-βGal from Promega) and determining the number of cells that stained blue (Promega protocol). Mobility shift assays were used to determine binding of extract proteins to synthetic oligonucleotides representing the AP-2 binding site. VSMC nuclear proteins were extracted as follows. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4). Samples then were incubated on ice for 10 min with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15% glycerol, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4), and the extracts were dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of buffer C (20 mmHEPES, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15% glycerol, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4). Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Nuclear extract binding assay was performed using AP-2 binding site double-stranded oligonucleotides as probe. The probe sequence included 5′-CCCCAGCCCCGCTCTGCCAGCT-3′, which corresponds to the MMP-2 promoter sequence 66–44. The nonspecific competing fragment consists of a scrambled sequence with the same nucleotide composition.32P-labeled AP-2 probe was mixed with the nuclear extract at room temperature in binding buffer (50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)). In competition assay, the unlabeled DNA was used as competitor and was incubated with the nuclear extracts before the addition of labeled probe. Bound and free DNA were resolved by electrophoresis through a regular polyacrylamide gel and then scanned using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. All densitometry data are presented as the mean ± the standard error about the mean, and all experiments were performed at least three times. To study the functions of CTGF, we stably transfected a CTGF over-expression construct into VSMC. MMP-2 activity was first measured in the conditioned media using standard zymography. We observed that in the CTGF over-expression media there is an approximate 3-fold increase in MMP-2 activity compared with untransfected VSMC media (Fig. 1). We further found that this increase was due to an increase of MMP-2 pro-enzyme in the media (Fig. 2). Because MMP-2 is secreted as pro-enzyme before being activated, the MMP-2 pro-enzyme was detected in Western analysis by using a specific anti-pro-MMP-2 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2). The levels of increase of MMP-2 proteins in both CTGF over-expression cells (Fig. 2 A) and media (Fig.2 B) over the controls are more than 3-fold, comparable with that found in MMP-2 activity. There are no apparent differences in protein and activity levels between the untransfected and the vector transfected cells, and we used both as controls.Figure 2A and B, Western analyses of MMP-2 protein in total cell extract (A) and in conditioned medium (B) demonstrating a visible increase of MMP-2 protein in CTGF over-expression cells and in the conditioned media. Total proteins were extracted from growth-arrested VSMC or precipitated from the conditioned media and probed with a MMP-2 specific monoclonal antibody. C and D, graphs represent the average densitometric data ± S.E. forA and B from three experiments. There are significant increases (more than 3-fold) of MMP-2 in both CTGF over-expression cells in total cell extract and in the conditioned media versus vector control. The inhibitory effects of anti-CTGF antibody, AP-1 antisense oligo, and cycloheximide are evident from the protein levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further examined the mRNA level of MMP-2 and found that CTGF over-expression increases MMP-2 mRNA over the untransfected and vector controls on an average of 3.5-fold (Fig.3), which is also consistent with the increase in MMP-2 protein level. Vector transfection alone does not change the level of MMP-2 mRNA (Fig. 3). To confirm that the increased MMP-2 level is the result of over-expression of CTGF, we used a recombinant CTGF to treat normal VSMC and found that by adding an exogenous recombinant CTGF (25 ng/ml) to the cultured VSMC for 6 h, the MMP-2 mRNA, antigen, and activity were increased to levels comparable with those in CTGF over-expression cells (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). Furthermore, the increase of MMP-2 mRNA, protein, and activity levels by exogenous addition can be blocked by a specific anti-CTGF antibody (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). We also tested whether the increase of MMP-2 expression by CTGF requires de novo protein synthesis and found that this induction can be inhibited by pretreatment with cycloheximide for 30 min (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). However, we also observed that the basal MMP-2 expression in normal cells does not show a marked decrease by this antibody (not shown), which may be because a different mechanism regulates constitutive MMP-2 expression. TIMPs are endogenous antagonists for their corresponding MMPs and in many cases are regulated by similar inducers and repressors (1Matrisian L.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Brown P.D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 52: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We also explored the possible effects of CTGF on TIMP-2 expression and examined its expression at the mRNA level in the CTGF over-expression and CTGF protein-treated cells. Our data show that there are no significant changes between the CTGF over-expression cells and the control cells (Fig. 4). The transcription regulation of MMP-2 has not been completely defined, and there are only a few transcription factors reportedly involved. One of them is the transcription factor AP-2, which has been shown specifically to bind to the regulatory region and activate MMP-2 gene expression (16Qin H. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29130-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether AP-2 mediates CTGF action in up-regulating MMP-2 expression. Our results show that in both CTGF over-expression and exogenous CTGF-treated cells, AP-2 mRNA levels were about 2-fold higher than in normal and vector control cells (Fig.5). To confirm that the increased AP-2 level was directly responsible for the increase of MMP-2 levels, we used an antisense oligo against the AP-2 transcription to treat the CTGF-transfected cells and found that this antisense oligo was effective and could block about 75% of the increase in MMP-2 mRNA, antigen, and activity levels (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), whereas a control oligo did not have much effect. However, the use of AP-2 antisense oligo did not completely block the increase of MMP-2, suggesting that other factors may also be involved in CTGF-regulated MMP-2 expression. We further examined the binding activities on the AP-2 element in the MMP-2 promoter region and found that there is an enhanced binding to this site by nuclear extract from CTGF over-expression cells compared with the extract from normal control cells. We used a labeled synthetic DNA fragment that contains the consensus AP-2 binding sequence (5′-CCCCACCCCGCTGCCAGCT-3′) and performed a gel mobility shift assay to determine the DNA-protein complex formation for cells over-expressing CTGF and for the normal control. As shown in Fig.6, two DNA-protein complexes were detected, and there were marked increases in shifted bands in CTGF over-expressing and exogenous CTGF-treated cells. In addition, the complexes could be competed away by an excess of unlabeled AP-2 fragment (Fig. 6) but were not affected by an unlabeled nonspecific fragment (GATA fragment). These findings confirm that the increased binding to AP-2 site is specific in CTGF over-expression and CTGF-treated cells. CTGF has recently been identified as a novel mitogen for endothelial, smooth muscle, and fibroblast cells (12Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). It also is involved in the regulation of ECM protein production and thus in wound repair and fibrosis. CTGF is strongly induced by TGF-β and may serve as its downstream effector (12Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Oemar and Luscher (17Oemar B.S. Luscher T.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; : 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) have found that CTGF is rarely detectable in normal blood vessels but is overexpressed in atherosclerotic lesions. The overexpression was found mainly in VSMC in the lesions, indicating that it may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. We previously found that VSMC proliferation and migration were stimulated by CTGF over-expression (14Fan W.H. Pech M. Karnovsky M.J. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and in this study, we observed that CTGF increases the expression of MMP-2 in VSMC culture; this increase is not accompanied by a corresponding increase of TIMP-2. We further determined that the elevated MMP-2 activity is the result of an increased level of MMP-2 mRNA. In searching a number of possible transcription factors that might mediate the transcription of MMP-2, we determined that AP-2 is involved in CTGF-induced MMP-2 expression. The expanding family of MMPs now comprises 25 members of the zinc-dependent metallopeptidases. The pathophysiological importance of these MMPs has been determined gradually, based on the growing list of their functions, which range from degrading basement membrane constituents such as fibronectin, laminin, collagen, and elastin (1Matrisian L.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Lamparter S. Maisch B. Z. Kardiol. 2000; 89: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) to interacting with a number of nonmatrix proteins such as tumor necrosis factor-β, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, and angiogenic factors (19Parsons S.L. Watson S.A. Brown P.D. Collins H.M. Steele R.J. Br. J. Surg. 1997; 84: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20Sang Q.X. Cell Res. 1998; 8: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This wide variety of activity reflects the multiple functions of MMPs in regulating biological and pathological processes such as cell migration, differentiation, and atherogenesis. The involvement of MMP-2 in the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis, which are characterized by lesion formation after arterial injury, has been reported in several studies (7Zempo N. Kenagy R.D. Au Y.P. Bendeck M. Clowes M.M. Reidy M.A. Clowes A.W. J. Vasc. Surg. 1994; 20: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 21Godin D. Ivan E. Johnson C.

Increased MMP-2 activity was found in and around atherosclerotic lesions. During lesion development in experimental balloon injury, MMP-2 plays a key role in degrading basement membrane and promoting the migration of VSMC from media to intima (7Zempo N. Kenagy R.D. Au Y.P. Bendeck M. Clowes M.M. Reidy M.A. Clowes A.W. J. Vasc. Surg. 1994; 20: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies by Koshikawaet al. (23Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) have shown that the cleavage of laminin-5 by MMP-2 exposes cryptic promigratory sites on laminin-5, which in turn triggers cell motility. In light of our previous and current results, it is conceivable that the CTGF-initiated pro-migratory effect is at least partially mediated by MMP-2 activity. In contrast to functional characterization, the regulation of MMP-2 transcription is inadequately delineated; there are only a few transcription factors that have been identified so far as binding to the MMP-2 promoter region. Qin and et al. (16Qin H. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29130-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) have shown that binding to the MMP-2 promoter area by transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and AP-2 leads to constitutive expression in astroglioma cells. However, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines commonly involved in VSMC proliferation, i.e.platelet-derived growth factor and interleukin-1, fail to up-regulate MMP-2 expression (24Fabunmi R.P. Baker A.H. Murray E.J. Booth R.F. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), suggesting that a different regulatory mechanism governs MMP-2 induction. TGF-β was shown to induce the transcription of MMP-2 during embryogenesis, but the role this regulation plays in atherogenesis remains unclear (25Miralles F. Battelino T. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In another report, Benbow and Brinckerhoff (26Benbow U. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) have shown that AP-1 activity is needed but that AP-2 is critical for tissue-specific MMP-2 expression. AP-1 alone does not regulate MMP-2 transcription, and there is an essential interaction with other cis-acting sequences in the promoter and with other transcription factors that bind to these sequences. We found in this study that the AP-2 level is increased in CTGF over-expression cells, which contributes significantly to the increase of mRNA level of MMP-2 because an AP-2 antisense oligo blocks most of the increase of MMP-2. Other factors may also be at work in CTGF-stimulated MMP-2 expression because blocking AP-2 alone does not completely inhibiting the induction of MMP-2. Transcription factor AP-2 has also been found in the regulation of a number of other genes, including biglycan and vascular endothelial growth factor, both of which were shown to be involved in various stages of atherosclerotic development (27Celletti F.L. Waugh J.M. Amabile P.G. Brendolan A. Hilfiker P.R. Dake M.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 28Yamakawa T. Bai H.Z. Masuda J. Sawa Y. Shirakura R. Ogata J. Matsuda H. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 152: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the mechanisms for AP-2 induction may involve three major pathways: activation of the retinoic acid receptor (29Luscher B Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 10: 1507-1517Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar), cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (30Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), and protein kinase C activation (31Hyman S.E. Comb M. Pearlberg J. Goodman H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to help elucidate which pathway is critical in the CTGF induction of AP-2 and the subsequent increase of MMP-2. Biglycan is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan that is involved in several pathophysiological processes including atherogenesis through its interactions with other ECM molecules and TGF-β (28Yamakawa T. Bai H.Z. Masuda J. Sawa Y. Shirakura R. Ogata J. Matsuda H. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 152: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Its synthesis is controlled by TGF-β, and biglycan and TGF-β are thought to form a negative feedback loop regulating TGF-β activity (32Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 33Ungefroren H. Krull N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15787-15795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Wegrowski Y. Pillarisetti J. Danielson K.G. Suzuki S. Iozzo R.V. Genomics. 1995; 30: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because CTGF is also closely controlled by TGF-β, it should be very interesting to investigate whether the modulation of biglycan expression by TGF-β is via CTGF and AP-2 and, if so, whether the TGF-β-biglycan loop should include CTGF and AP-2 as well. In general, in the current study we have demonstrated an increased level of MMP-2 regulated by CTGF and underscored the importance of understanding the complex interactions of gene activities under the direct and indirect control of TGF-β. Because TGF-β plays a pivotal role as an endogenous growth regulatory factor in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, e.g. progressive neointimal thickening (restenosis) after angioplasty (35Nikol S. Isner J.M. Pickering J.G. Kearney M. Leclerc G. Weir L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and atherosclerosis, a better understanding of its mechanisms will surely advance future plans to block targeted molecules to treat and prevent the development of cardiovascular disease. We are indebted to Dr. Michael Pech of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland, for his generous gift of the recombinant CTGF and anti-CTGF antibody."

To this end, we synthesized theDrosophila core histones in Escherichia coli. The purified histones were lacking covalent modifications as well as their N-terminal initiating methionine residues. The recombinant histones were efficiently assembled into periodic nucleosome arrays in a completely purified recombinant system with DrosophilaATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF),Drosophila nucleosome assembly protein-1, plasmid DNA, and ATP. With the Gal4-VP16 activator and a crude transcription extract, we found that the transcriptional properties of ACF-assembled chromatin containing unmodified histones were similar to those of chromatin containing native histones. We then examined ACF-catalyzed chromatin remodeling with completely purified factors and chromatin consisting of unmodified histones. In these experiments, we observed promoter-specific disruption of the regularity of nucleosome arrays upon binding of Gal4-VP16 as well as nucleosome positioning by R3 Lac repressor and subsequent nucleosome remobilization upon isopropylβ-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced dissociation of R3 from the template. Thus, chromatin assembly and remodeling by ACF can occur in the absence of histone modifications.

The basic unit of chromatin, the nucleosome core particle, consists of 146 bp of DNA wrapped 1.7 times around a core histone octamer that contains two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Luger K.

Hence, for these and other chromatin-utilizing processes, it is important to investigate how the structure of chromatin affects its function. Chromatin is a complex biological polymer in which the histones are subjected to a variety of posttranslational modifications, which include acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and ADP-ribosylation (3Wolffe A.P.

To study the influence of histone modifications upon chromatin structure and function, it is first necessary to investigate the properties of chromatin consisting of histones that are devoid of covalent modifications. Thus, in this study, we describe the ATP-dependent assembly of periodic nucleosome arrays with a purified recombinant system that consists of DrosophilaACF,1 DrosophilaNAP-1, Drosophila core histones, and DNA. TheDrosophila S-phase-regulated core histones were synthesized in Escherichia coli to obtain a preparation of core histones that are devoid of posttranslational modifications.

Each of the four core histone genes was subjected to PCR amplification with primers that incorporated an NdeI restriction site at the initiating Met codon as well as a BamHI site at the 3′ end of the gene. Then, each NdeI-BamHI fragment was ligated into pET-11a (Novagen) that was previously digested withNdeI and BamHI. The histone genes in each of the resulting plasmids, termed pdH2A, pdH2B, pdH3, and pdH4, were resequenced to confirm their integrity. Next, an H3-H4 co-expression vector, termed pdH3-dH4, was created by insertion of the H4 gene-containing BglII-BamHI fragment of pdH4 into pdH3 that was linearized with BamHI. The sequences of the PCR primers are available upon request. Recombinant H2A was produced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring pdH2A, whereas recombinant H2B was produced inE. coli strain JM109(DE3) harboring pdH2B. Freshly transformed cells were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and histone protein synthesis was induced at anA 600 of ∼0.6 by the addition of IPTG (Promega) to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. H2A synthesis was induced for 1 h at 37 °C, whereas H2B production was induced for 16 h at 37 °C. Unless stated otherwise, all subsequent operations were performed at 4 °C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (8,000 rpm, 5 min; Sorvall GSA rotor) and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (4 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl) (100 ml/liter bacterial cell culture). The pellets were resuspended in Buffer A (10 mm Hepes (K+), pH 7.6, 6 m guanidine-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, and 2 mm benzamidine-HCl) (10 ml/liter bacterial cell culture). Each pellet (H2A and H2B) was separately dispersed with a Dounce homogenizer. The suspensions were then combined and subjected to additional homogenization. The resulting mixture was dialyzed extensively against Buffer D (10 mm Hepes (K+), pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, and 2 mmbenzamidine-HCl) containing 0.1 m NaCl. Next, concentrated HCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 n, and the mixture was incubated at −20 °C for 30 min. The insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation (30,000 rpm, 15 min; Beckman SW41 rotor). The supernatant was collected, neutralized with 0.25 volume of 2 m Tris base, and dialyzed extensively against Buffer D containing 0.1 m NaCl. The resulting H2A-H2B dimers were purified by Source 15S (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) chromatography (column volume = 1 ml; column dimensions (diameter × length) = 0.5 × 5 cm; flow rate = 1 ml/min; fraction size = 0.5 ml). The sample was applied to the column in Buffer D containing 0.1 m NaCl and washed with 10 ml of the same buffer. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient (20 ml) from 0.1 to 2m NaCl in Buffer D. Peak fractions of H2A-H2B eluted at 1m NaCl and were pooled. The resulting H2A-H2B was dialyzed against Storage Buffer (10 mm Hepes (K+), pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The typical yield of H2A-H2B is 2 mg/liter bacterial culture of H2B (which is synthesized at lower levels than H2A). Recombinant H3 and H4 were produced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring pdH3-dH4. Freshly transformed cells were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and histone protein synthesis was induced at an A 600of ∼0.6 by the addition of IPTG (Promega) to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. H3-H4 synthesis was induced for 1 h at 37 °C. Unless stated otherwise, all subsequent operations were performed at 4 °C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (8,000 rpm, 5 min; Sorvall GSA rotor) and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (100 ml/liter bacterial cell culture). The pellets were resuspended in Buffer D containing 0.1 m NaCl (20 ml/liter bacterial cell culture) and lysed by three cycles of sonication of 30 s each. The lysate was subjected to centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min; Sorvall SS34 rotor), and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was suspended in 0.25 n HCl (10 ml/liter bacterial cell culture) and dispersed with a Dounce homogenizer. The resulting suspension was incubated at −20 °C for 30 min and subjected to centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min; Sorvall SS34 rotor). The supernatant was collected and neutralized with 0.125 volume of 2m Tris base. The solution was dialyzed against Buffer D containing 0.1 m NaCl, and the H3-H4 tetramers were purified by Source 15S chromatography, as described above for the purification of the H2A-H2B dimers. Peak fractions eluted at 1m NaCl and were pooled. The H3-H4 was dialyzed extensively against Storage Buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The typical yield of H3-H4 is 4 mg/liter bacterial cell culture. Chromatin assembly reactions, micrococcal nuclease digestion assays, and DNA supercoiling assays were performed essentially as described by Ito et al. (20Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) with either supercoiled plasmid DNA or relaxed (covalently closed circular) plasmid DNA that had been previously treated with purified recombinantDrosophila topoisomerase I. Standard chromatin assembly reactions (final volume, 100 μl) contained plasmid DNA (0.3 μg; 0.14 pmol of a 3.2-kb plasmid), purified Drosophila core histones (either native or recombinant; 0.27 μg; 20 pmol of histone polypeptides), purified recombinant (baculovirus-synthesized)Drosophila NAP-1 (2.3 μg; 41 pmol of dNAP-1 polypeptides), and purified recombinant (baculovirus-synthesized)Drosophila ACF (13 ng; 45 fmol) in 10 mm Hepes (K+), pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 3 mm ATP, an ATP regenerating system (30 mm phosphocreatine and 1 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase), and 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were performed at 27 °C for 2 h, unless indicated otherwise. With the recombinant histones, we obtained essentially identical results when H2A-H2B dimers were combined with H3-H4 tetramers in a 2:1 molar ratio before chromatin assembly and when histone octamers were formed from the recombinant histones (in 2 m NaCl) and purified by gel filtration (in 2 m NaCl; followed by dialysis into assembly buffer, which causes dissociation of octamers into dimers and tetramers) before chromatin assembly (data not shown). We typically added the recombinant core histones into the assembly reactions separately as H2A-H2B dimers and H3-H4 tetramers. In vitro transcription reactions with chromatin templates were carried out with aDrosophila nuclear extract termed the soluble nuclear fraction essentially as described previously (21Kamakaka R.T.

The transcripts were detected by primer extension analysis, and the data were quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Micrococcal nuclease digestion and indirect end-labeling analysis with R3 Lac repressor was carried out as described previously (23Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1998: 173-194Google Scholar, 25Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except that chromatin was assembled with purified factors instead of the crude S190 chromatin assembly extract. Standard chromatin assembly reactions were performed with pU6-LNS plasmid DNA (a 3.2-kb plasmid that contains twolac operators, each with a 21-bp recognition sequence identical to that of the wild-type E. coli lacO1 operator, separated by 183 bp of DNA) with either native or recombinant Drosophila core histones. Where indicated, purified R3 Lac repressor (50 nm) was added at the onset of chromatin assembly, and the reactions were carried out to completion (reaction time, 2 h). In addition, IPTG (1 mm) was added, where indicated, after chromatin assembly to dissociate the R3 Lac repressor, and the mixture was incubated at 27 °C for an additional 30 min to allow movement of the nucleosomes. (Due to the loss of ACF activity over the course of the 2-h reaction period (data not shown), it was also necessary to add additional ACF (the same amount as that added at the beginning of chromatin assembly) at the same time as IPTG to catalyze nucleosome mobilization upon dissociation of R3 protein.) The samples were then partially digested with micrococcal nuclease (Sigma), deproteinized, and cleaved withAlwNI (New England Biolabs). The positions of the nucleosomes were revealed by Southern blot analysis of the DNA samples with a radiolabeled probe that hybridizes near the AlwNI restriction site. Single-round primer extension footprinting analysis of R3 binding and dissociation was performed essentially as described previously (23Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1998: 173-194Google Scholar, 25Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with aliquots of the same chromatin samples that were subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion and indirect end-labeling analysis. In Drosophila, the S-phase-regulated histones are present in a gene cluster that is repeated ∼100 times in chromosome region 39DE (18Goldberg M.L. Sequence Analysis of Drosophila Histone Genes. Stanford University, 1979Google Scholar, 19Lifton R.P. Goldberg M.L. Karp R.W. Hogness D.S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 42: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using PCR, we amplified the coding sequences of each of the Drosophila core histone genes in the cDm500 plasmid (18Goldberg M.L. Sequence Analysis of Drosophila Histone Genes. Stanford University, 1979Google Scholar, 19Lifton R.P. Goldberg M.L. Karp R.W. Hogness D.S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 42: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains one copy of the histone gene cluster. We individually subcloned each of the core histone genes into the pET-11a bacterial expression vector, and then we created a co-expression plasmid for histones H3 and H4. Each of the resulting expression clones was resequenced to confirm that mutagenesis had not occurred during the PCR and subcloning steps. By using the bacterial expression plasmids, H2A-H2B dimers and H3-H4 tetramers were purified to near homogeneity. As seen in Fig.1, the recombinant Drosophilahistones exhibit the same electrophoretic mobility as their native counterparts on a 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. In addition, we confirmed that translation of the recombinant histones had terminated at the appropriate stop codons by analysis of the purified proteins by electrospray mass spectrometry (data not shown). We observed a single major peak for each of H2A, H2B, and H3. These proteins were lacking their initiating Met residues, as do the native core histones. With H4, we observed a major species that was lacking the initiating Met residue and a minor species that contained the initiating Met residue. In these measurements, the observed and calculated masses differed by a maximum of 0.02% (i.e. 3 mass units). We also subjected nativeDrosophila core histones to mass spectrometry, and in contrast to the results with the recombinant histones, we observed multiple and/or broad peaks, all of which were greater than the calculated masses of the individual core histones. These results confirm the absence of modification of the recombinant core histones as well as the integrity of the proteins. In vivo, newly synthesized core histones exhibit a specific acetylation pattern that may be important for histone transport and/or chromatin assembly (see, for example, Refs.26Shimamura A. Worcel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14524-14530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We therefore tested whether our unmodified core histones can be assembled into periodic nucleosome arrays. We had previously shown that purified nativeDrosophila core histones can be assembled into periodic nucleosome arrays by purified recombinant Drosophila ACF (an ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (20Ito T.

Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)) in a reaction that consists of ACF, dNAP-1, histones, DNA, and ATP. In this process, ACF mediates the ATP-dependent deposition of histones onto DNA in a manner that yields a periodic array of nucleosomes (20Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 31Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). With this purified defined chromatin assembly system, we compared the ability of native and recombinant histones to be assembled into chromatin. These experiments revealed that purified recombinant histones can be efficiently assembled into chromatin, as assessed by the DNA supercoiling assay (Fig. 2 A) as well as by the micrococcal nuclease digestion assay (Fig.2 B). We found that chromatin assembly with native or recombinant histones occurred readily with supercoiled or topoisomerase I-relaxed plasmid DNA. In addition, a higher degree of supercoiling was seen when chromatin assembly was carried out with supercoiled DNA relative to relaxed DNA in reactions containing either native or recombinant histones (Fig. 2 A). To test the factor requirements for chromatin assembly with the recombinant histones, we performed assembly reactions in the presence or absence of individual reaction components. As shown in Fig.2 C, ACF, dNAP-1, and ATP are each required for chromatin assembly with the recombinant histones, as seen previously with native histones (31Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). These results provide further confirmation that the mechanism of chromatin assembly with unmodified recombinant histones is similar to that with native histones. We further examined the rate and efficiency of the chromatin assembly reaction because it typically appeared that the periodicity of the micrococcal nuclease digestion ladders of the recombinant histone-containing chromatin is slightly less than that of the native histone-containing chromatin (see, for example, Fig. 2 B). In these experiments, we performed a time course of chromatin assembly with native versus recombinant histones and monitored the progress of the reaction by using the DNA supercoiling assay. Equivalent amounts of the deproteinized reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis in separate agarose gels that contained either 0 or 1 μm chloroquine, which allows resolution of highly negatively supercoiled species that co-migrate in standard agarose gels. As shown in Fig. 3, there is no apparent difference in the rate or efficiency of assembly with native (lanes N) or recombinant (lanes R) histones when the samples are analyzed in the standard agarose gel lacking chloroquine. Yet, in contrast, analysis of the samples in the chloroquine gel showed that the rate and efficiency of assembly are lower with the recombinant histones than with the native histones (Fig.3, bottom panel). This effect was reproducibly observed, and variation of the concentration of the recombinant histones did not increase the rate or efficiency of assembly (data not shown). It thus appears that the covalent modification of the native histones is responsible for the slightly higher rate and efficiency of assembly with native versus recombinant histones. Overall, these studies on chromatin assembly have shown that recombinant histones are efficiently assembled into chromatin that consists of extended periodic nucleosome arrays. We therefore continued our analysis of the properties of the chromatin containing unmodified recombinant histones. Covalent histone modifications are critically important for the regulation of transcriptional activity (for reviews, see Refs.3Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function.3rd Ed.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar), and we therefore sought to test the transcriptional properties of chromatin lacking histone modifications in a simple biochemical system. To this end, we performed chromatin assembly reactions with the unmodified recombinant histones, as in Figs. 2 and 3, and then subjected the resulting chromatin to in vitro transcription analysis with a low-salt Drosophilanuclear extract termed the soluble nuclear fraction (21Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, the Gal4-VP16 activator (33Chasman D.I. Leatherwood J. Carey M. Ptashne M. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4746-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was used along with the reporter plasmid pGIE-0, which contains five tandem Gal4 sites upstream of the adenovirus E4 core promoter (22Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, Gal4-VP16 is able to activate transcription from chromatin templates that are assembled with either native or recombinant histones. Comparable levels of transcription are seen when the Gal4-VP16 is added to naked DNA before chromatin assembly (Fig. 4, Before Assembly) or to chromatin that has been previously assembled (Fig. 4, After Assembly). Therefore, the transcriptional properties of ACF-assembled chromatin consisting of unmodified recombinant histones are similar to those of ACF-assembled chromatin consisting of native histones. To test whether histone modifications are necessary for the mobilization of nucleosomes, we carried out chromatin remodeling assays. A key feature of these experiments is that they are performed with completely purified components and are thus unlikely to involve the covalent modification of histones. First, we examined the ability of Gal4-VP16 to induce promoter-specific chromatin remodeling (Fig. 5). In these experiments, ACF-mediated chromatin assembly was performed with pGIE-0 plasmid DNA, which contains five tandem Gal4 sites upstream of the adenovirus E4 core promoter, as noted above. The assembly reactions were carried out with either native or recombinant histones in the presence or absence of Gal4-VP16, and the resulting samples were subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion analysis. Analysis of the total DNA, as visualized by staining with ethidium bromide, indicated that there were no detectable changes in the regularity of the nucleosome spacing of the bulk chromatin (Fig. 5, left panels). Southern blot analysis of the same gels revealed Gal4-VP16-dependent disruption of the regularity of the nucleosome arrays in the proximal promoter region (adjacent to the Gal4 binding sites) but not at a distal location (∼900 bp from the Gal4 sites) (Fig. 5, middle andright panels). These results thus indicate that covalent histone modifications are not required for Gal4-VP16-induced nucleosome remodeling. We further tested whether nucleosome positioning and ACF-catalyzed nucleosome mobilization can occur with the unmodified histones. To this end, we used R3 Lac repressor as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that can be dissociated upon the addition of the lactose analog, IPTG. R3 protein is a dimeric Lac repressor derivative that binds only to a single lac operator, which is in contrast to the tetrameric wild-type Lac repressor that can bind simultaneously to two separate lac operators (34Alberti S. Oehler S. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3227-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Chen J. Alberti S. Matthews K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12482-12487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conjunction with R3 protein, we used a template that contains two lac operators separated by 183 bp. We had previously shown that a positioned array of several nucleosomes is formed when chromatin is assembled onto this template (with a crude S190 extract) in the presence of R3 protein and that the nucleosomes become randomly distributed by ATP-dependent nucleosome mobilization activities (in the S190 extract) upon dissociation of R3 with IPTG (25Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We examined nucleosome positioning and mobilization with the unmodified recombinant histones as follows. By using purified ACF and dNAP-1, we performed chromatin assembly reactions with native or recombinant histones in the presence or absence of R3 protein. Micrococcal nuclease digestion and indirect end-labeling analysis revealed that a positioned array of nucleosomes is induced by R3 protein (Fig.6 A). Then, we added IPTG to the chromatin to dissociate the R3 protein from the templates and observed mobilization of the nucleosomes, as indicated by the loss of specific nucleosome positioning. We additionally confirmed the binding and dissociation of R3 protein to the same chromatin samples by primer extension DNase I footprinting analysis (Fig. 6 B). These results show that ACF-catalyzed nucleosome positioning and mobilization occur with chromatin containing either recombinant or native histones. Hence, the covalent modification of histones is not necessary for nucleosome positioning and mobilization by ACF. We describe the synthesis and purification of unmodified, recombinantDrosophila core histones. In addition, the purification of bacterially synthesized core histones from Xenopus laevis(36Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M.Y. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (37Gelbart M.E. Rechsteiner T. Richmond T.J. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2098-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38White C.L. Suto R.K. Luger K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5207-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) has been reported. In those studies, each of the core histones polypeptides was synthesized in E. coli, and the individual histones, each of which is insoluble, were purified separately under denaturing conditions in the presence of 7 m urea. In our work, we employed a different strategy for the synthesis and purification of theDrosophila core histones. Histones H3 and H4 were co-synthesized in E. coli; then, H3-H4 tetramers were solubilized with 0.25 n HCl, neutralized, and purified by cation exchange chromatography under nondenaturing conditions. Histones H2A and H2B were synthesized separately. Then, H2A-H2B dimers were formed by denaturation with 6 m guanidine followed by renaturation in the absence of guanidine and subsequently purified by cation exchange chromatography under nondenaturing conditions. This approach to the purification of recombinant core histones may be useful for other studies of histone structure and function. By using ACF and dNAP-1, we were able to assemble the purified recombinantDrosophila core histones into periodic nucleosome arrays. It is interesting to compare these results with those of Loyola et al. (39Loyola A. LeRoy G. Wang Y.-H. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2837-2851PubMed Google Scholar), in which the assembly of bacterially synthesizedXenopus core histones into chromatin was carried out with purified native human RSF, a factor that consists of hSNF2h (which is related to Drosophila ISWI) and a 325-kDa subunit. First, RSF-mediated chromatin assembly occurs in the absence of a core histone chaperone (39Loyola A. LeRoy G. Wang Y.-H. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2837-2851PubMed Google Scholar), such as NAP-1, which is required for ACF-mediated chromatin assembly (20Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 31Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Second, RSF-mediated assembly of recombinant histones was found to be stimulated by p300 and acetyl-CoA (39Loyola A. LeRoy G. Wang Y.-H. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2837-2851PubMed Google Scholar), whereas, in contrast, we did not observe any stimulation of ACF-mediated chromatin assembly of recombinant histones by p300 and acetyl-CoA (data not shown). Thus, the mechanism of chromatin assembly by RSF is distinct from the process by which ACF and NAP-1 assemble nucleosomes. In fact, these findings suggest that there may be different mechanisms of chromatin assembly that possess different requirements for histone modifications. In other studies with bacterially synthesized core histones, nucleosome core particles or chromatin was prepared by salt dialysis (36Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M.Y. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 38White C.L. Suto R.K. Luger K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5207-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) or by a two-step procedure in which histones are initially randomly deposited onto DNA by NAP-1 in an ATP-independent process and then rearranged into a periodic array with an ATP-utilizing remodeling factor or polypeptide (37Gelbart M.E. Rechsteiner T. Richmond T.J. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2098-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 40Clapier C.R. Längst G. Corona D.F.V. Becker P.B. Nightingale K.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Hence, there are different methods for the preparation of core particles or chromatin with recombinant histones, and the suitability of any specific procedure will depend on the desired application. In this work, we describe a simple and accessible approach that uses completely recombinant proteins for the efficient assembly of periodic nucleosome arrays.

In our defined biochemical system, we have been able to analyze the effects of the absence of histone modifications upon nucleosome mobilization in a context that is separate from the many other functions of chromatin that occur in vivo or in a crude extract. Thus, in the absence of histone modifications, we observed promoter-specific disruption of the regularity of nucleosome arrays by the binding of Gal4-VP16 (Fig. 5) as well as nucleosome positioning by R3 Lac repressor and subsequent nucleosome remobilization upon IPTG-induced dissociation of R3 from the template (Fig. 6). Thus, histone modifications are not required for the mobilization of nucleosomes by ACF. These findings indicate that nucleosome mobility is not necessarily dependent upon a specific pattern of histone modifications and are consistent with the histone code hypothesis, in which histone modifications act as recognition signals for the action of other factors. In summary, we have assembled chromatin with fully defined components: purified E. coli-synthesized core histones, purified recombinant ACF, purified recombinant dNAP-1, plasmid DNA, and ATP. In the absence of posttranslational modifications, the bacterially synthesized histones are assembled efficiently into periodic nucleosome arrays. In addition, the chromatin consisting of unmodified recombinant histones is functional for transcription in vitro as well as for ACF-catalyzed nucleosome mobilization. It thus appears that nucleosomes can be mobilized in the absence of specific histone modifications. Lastly, the fully recombinant chromatin assembly system with homogeneous unmodified histones should be useful for the analysis of the effects of histone modifications upon chromatin function.

Here, we report that in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats, telomerase is selectively activated and telomeres are lengthened, in vivo and in vitro. Down-regulation of telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the maintenance and elongation of telomeres (the ends of chromosomes) arrests the increased proliferation of spontaneously hypertensive rat vascular smooth muscle cells and induces apoptosis. This apoptosis is reversible by overexpressing telomerase and is prevented by increasing p53 tumor suppressor protein expression and worsened by lowering p53. Telomerase activation, telomere maintenance, and the p53 checkpoint appear to be critical for increased vascular smooth muscle proliferation, thus they represent potential novel therapeutic targets in hypertension."

Proteins destined for these surfaces possess various types of structures or motifs that are recognized by specific sorting mechanisms in thetrans-Golgi network (TGN)1 and are subsequently delivered via separate vesicles to the correct surface domain (1Nelson W.J.

Apical sorting signals are not as unique, are less well defined, and can be located in the luminal, membrane, or cytosolic domains of the targeted protein. Structurally diverse apical signals are known that are encoded in the proteinaceous, carbohydrate, or lipid moieties of the sorted proteins. Glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchors direct proteins to the apical surface of several types of epithelial cells (18Brown D.A. Crise B. Rose J.K.

Another type of glycosylation,O-glycosylation, has been demonstrated to be important in directing the neurotrophin receptor and intestinal sucrase-isomaltase (SI) to the apical membrane (28Alfalah M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Finally, carbohydrate-independent sorting signals, most likely protein subdomains, are implicated in the sorting of intestinal lactase-phlorizin hydrolase and many other proteins (31Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this paper we investigate the role of glycans in the sorting of a heavily N- and O-glycosylated glycoprotein, dipeptidyl peptidase IV. This protein is usually sorted with high fidelity to the apical membrane of intestinal cells (32Matter K. Brauchbar M. Bucher K. Hauri H.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 429-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). By virtue of its convenient structural features DPPIV serves as an exquisite model protein for analyses aimed at elucidating the sorting behavior and sorting signals of proteins. DPPIV is a type II membrane glycoprotein that is synthesized with an uncleavable signal sequence that functions as a membrane anchoring domain (33Misumi Y. Hayashi Y. Arakawa F. Ikehara Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Fan H. Meng W. Kilian C. Grams S. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Processing of the 100-kDa mannose-rich DPPIV species to the 124-kDa complex glycosylated mature form includes an extensiveO-glycosylation event, mainly in a Ser/Thr-rich stalk domain adjacent to the membrane anchor (35Matter K. Hauri H.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1916-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After maturation in the Golgi apparatus, DPPIV is transported to the apical membrane, either directly from the TGN or along the transcytotic pathway through the basolateral membrane (32Matter K. Brauchbar M. Bucher K. Hauri H.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 429-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In Caco-2 cells at least 85% of newly synthesized DPPIV is expressed at the apical membrane and in steady state determinations and in pulse-chase experiments DPPIV is entirely found at the apical membrane after prolonged chase periods (32Matter K. Brauchbar M. Bucher K. Hauri H.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 429-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the transcytotic pathway is not the major sorting event, otherwise substantially more DPPIV would be present at the basolateral membrane. The identity and location of the sorting signals of DPPIV as well as the sorting mechanism have not yet been investigated in great detail. Recent data have proposed O-glycosylation to be crucial for apical sorting (36Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A possible role of N-linked glycosylation remains undetermined, and recent data have excluded sialic acids on N-linked glycans being implicated in the sorting event of DPPIV (37Slimane T.A. Lenoir C. Sapin C. Maurice M. Trugnan G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The main purpose of this paper is to delineate the mechanism by which DPPIV is sorted to the apical membrane in Caco-2 cells. We show thatO-glycans play a role in the sorting event. However, a high sorting fidelity is substantially strengthened by the presence of complex glycosylated but not mannose-rich N-linked glycans. Furthermore, DPPIV associates on its way to the brush border membrane with Triton X-100-insoluble cholesterol-rich microdomains, although sphingolipids do not constitute a critical structure of these domains. Caco-2 and HT-29 (38Rousset M. Chevalier G. Rousset J.P. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 531-534PubMed Google Scholar) cells were cultured in 10-cm Petri dishes or on membrane filters (Falcon, Plymouth, UK), as described previously (36Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and were usually labeled biosynthetically at day 6 after confluence. When used, benzyl-GalNAc, an inhibitor of O-glycosylation (39Kojima N. Handa K. Newman W. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The final concentration of benzyl-GalNAc was 4 mm, that of swainsonine was 4 μg/μl, that of fumonisin was 10 μm, and that of β-cyclodextrin was 50 mm (all reagents were obtained from Sigma). Metabolic labeling of Caco-2 or HT-29 cells grown on filters or plated in 6-well culture dishes was performed as described previously (28Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cells were labeled for 4 h with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). In pulse-chase experiments, the cells were pulsed with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine for 15 min followed by a chase with cold methionine for different intervals. The cells were solubilized using a combination of Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate in the presence of protease inhibitors, and the detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with mouse mAb anti-DPPIV (hybridoma HBB 3/153, Ref. 42Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cell surface antigens were immunoprecipitated from intact cells on filters by addition of anti-DPPIV antibody to either the apical or basolateral compartments. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6% polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Caco-2 or HT-29 cells were grown 6 days after confluence and were biosynthetically labeled for 4 h with [35S]methionine. The cells were solubilized in the cold for 2 h with 1% Triton X-100 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. The detergent extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-DPPIV. The pellet was dissolved by boiling in 1% SDS for 10 min. Thereafter, a 10-fold volume of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 was added. These extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatant was also immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-DPPIV that recognizes native and denatured forms of DPPIV (44Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In parallel, lipid microdomains were isolated on a 5–35% sucrose gradient as described previously (28Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). DPPIV was immunoprecipitated from the individual gradient fractions with mAb anti-DPPIV, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6% gels. Caco-2 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min and chased for 4 h with cold methionine. The pulse and chase were performed in the presence or absence of benzyl-GalNAc, swainsonine, or both using similar final concentrations as described above. The cells were solubilized in the cold for 2 h with 1% Triton X-100 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and the detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with mAb anti-DPPIV. The immunoprecipitates were treated or not treated with 50 μg of trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, after which time the reaction was terminated by boiling in 3-fold SDS-PAGE Laemmli buffer. The treatment of immunoprecipitates with 5 units of the V8 protease was performed for 90 min in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C (45Quinn M.T. Mullen M.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7303-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by a similar treatment as in the case of trypsin. The treated and non-treated DPPIV glycoforms were subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Digestion of [35S]methionine-labeled immunoprecipitates with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F/glycopeptidase F (endo F) was performed as described previously (46Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Analysis of proteins was performed on 6% slab gels according to Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). By using enzymatic and chemical deglycosylation procedures, it has been convincingly demonstrated that DPPIV is a heavilyO-glycosylated glycoprotein (36Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, an association between trimming of mannose-rich N-linked glycans of DPPIV and the onset of O-glycosylation in the cis-Golgi could be demonstrated in the presence of deoxymannojirimycin (dMM), an inhibitor of cis-Golgi mannosidase I. In fact,O-glycosylation of DPPIV is drastically reduced when trimming was inhibited. The polarized sorting of DPPIV was substantially affected in the presence of dMM implicatingO-glycans in the sorting event. However, dMM inhibits processing of mannose-rich chains, and it is therefore unclear whether complex N-glycans that do not occur in the presence of dMM are involved in sorting. Here we employed benzyl-GalNAc, a potent inhibitor of O-linked glycosylation, which competes withN-acetylgalactosamine in binding to the potentialO-glycosylation sites, Ser or Thr. This inhibitor has been shown not to affect complex N-glycosylation (39Kojima N. Handa K. Newman W. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The effect of benzyl-GalNAc on structural features of DPPIV was then examined in Caco-2 cells that were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine for 4 h in the presence or absence of the inhibitor. Fig. 1 depicts the results obtained in these experiments. DPPIV appeared predominantly as a 124-kDa complex glycosylated species within 4 h of labeling (denoted DPPIVc) in the absence of benzyl-GalNAc as shown previously (36Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in intestinal biopsy samples. It shifted to a diffuseO-glycosylated band upon endo F/GF treatment. A substantial reduction in the size of the complex glycosylated glycoform of DPPIV to about 115-kDa (denoted DPPIVc/benzyl) was discerned in benzyl-GalNAc-treated Caco-2 cells. To examine whetherO-glycosylation has been affected, we made use of the observation that N-deglycosylation of complex glycosylated wild type DPPIVc with endo F/GF results in a polypeptide that is O-glycosylated. Alterations in theO-glycosylation pattern of DPPIVc/benzyl could be readily monitored in their N-deglycosylated forms, and a change in the size of the N-deglycosylated forms is reminiscent of different O-glycosylation. Fig. 1 shows that the endo F/GF product of DPPIVc/benzyl was substantially smaller than its DPPIVc counterpart which isO-glycosylated. It is evident therefore thatO-glycosylation has been directly affected and is markedly reduced in DPPIVc/benzyl. Having assessed the effect of benzyl-GalNAc on the O-glycosylation of DPPIV, we examined the sorting behavior of the modified glycoform DPPIVc/benzyl. For this, cell surface immunoprecipitations with mAb anti-DPPIV were performed on Caco-2 cells that have been pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased for several time points in the presence or absence of benzyl-GalNAc (Fig.2). 1 h into the chase DPPIV appeared predominantly at the apical surface of Caco-2 cells that were labeled in the absence of benzyl-GalNAc. This sorting pattern persisted throughout 4 h of chase. In the presence of benzyl-GalNAc a shift in the sorting behavior of the modified DPPIVc/benzylglycoform to the basolateral membrane could be discerned (Fig. 2). At 1 h of chase almost 25% of the DPPIVc/benzylglycoform was found at the basolateral membrane, and the proportion of basolaterally located DPPIVc/benzyl increased to almost 40% at the 2- and 4-h chase time points. This result indicates that modification of the O-linked glycosylation is compatible with alterations in the sorting event and points to a direct implication of O-linked glycans as an apical sorting signal. On the other hand, the variation in the sorting behavior is not as drastic as in the case of the heavily O-glycosylated sucrase-isomaltase, where almost equal distribution of this protein could be observed on both sides of the membrane whenO-glycosylation is inhibited by benzyl-GalNAc (28Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is possible that components other than O-glycans are implicated in the sorting of DPPIV. Previous work from our laboratory (36Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) has shown that polarized sorting of DPPIV is not affected when complexN-linked glycosylation was modulated at the site of action of swainsonine, an inhibitor of Golgi mannosidase II. Additionally, swainsonine had neither a direct nor an indirect effect onO-glycosylation of DPPIV, whereas the size of theN-linked glycans was smaller than the normally glycosylated DPPIV species. By contrast dMM which inhibits the processing of the outermost mannose-rich mannoses by mannosidase I has markedly shifted the high polarity of DPPIV to an almost randomly distributed protein on both sides of the membrane. At this stage of investigation the effect was attributed to the absence of O-glycans, the processing of which has been indirectly affected by the presence of the unprocessed mannose-rich chains (see Ref. 36Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar for more details). The sorting pattern of DPPIV was not as drastically altered upon inhibition of O-glycosylation by benzyl-GalNAc as it was in the presence of dMM, and this is explained as follows. First, only partialO-glycosylation occurred in the presence of benzyl-GalNAc but was sufficient to prevent a complete depolarization of the targeting pattern of DPPIV. Second, additional components toO-glycans are implicated in the sorting of DPPIV. Possible candidates are mature complex glycosylated N-linked glycans. The following observations lend support to this hypothesis. In the presence of dMM the processing of mannose-rich N-linked glycans of DPPIV to the mature form does not take place,O-glycosylation is impaired, and targeting of DPPIV follows a random pattern. On the other hand, in the presence of swainsonine, which inhibits mannosidase II, an incompletely processed but nevertheless endo H-resistant N-linked andO-glycosylated DPPIV is correctly sorted to the apical membrane (36Naim H.Y. Joberty G. Alfalah M. Jacob R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17961-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Altogether a possible role for complex glycosylatedN-linked glycans in conjunction with O-linked glycans could be hypothesized. To examine this possibility, we labeled cells in the presence of benzyl-GalNAc and swainsonine to affect bothN- and O-linked glycosylation, and we analyzed the sorting of DPPIV. Under these conditions DPPIV shifted further to a smaller protein (DPPIVc/benzyl/swa) as compared with the glycoforms obtained in the presence of benzyl-GalNAc or swainsonine alone. The sorting behavior of this DPPIV glycoform was next investigated using a pulse-chase protocol of biosynthetically labeled Caco-2 cells. Fig. 2 demonstrates that a further alteration in the trafficking of DPPIV as compared with DPPIVc/benzyl has occurred. At 1 h of chase only 55% of DPPIVc/benzyl/swa was located at the apical membrane. With increasing chase DPPIVc/benzyl/swa became almost equally distributed at the apical and basolateral membranes. The results demonstrate that the type and structure of N- andO-linked complex glycans are together critical elements in the apical targeting of DPPIV. It is also obvious thatO-linked glycans alone are not sufficient for a sorting of DPPIV with high fidelity to the apical membrane. The drastic effects of N- andO-linked glycosylation on the sorting of DPPIV raise the question whether carbohydrates are directly implicated in the sorting event or whether their modification has altered the folding of a protein epitope that comprises the sorting signal. To examine the folding pattern of the various glycoforms of DPPIV, we analyzed the sensitivity of these forms toward trypsin and the V8 protease. The rationale is that a change in the folding pattern would be associated with an altered accessibility of the protein toward the proteases. As shown in Fig. 3 the various glycoforms of DPPIV did not reveal differences in their band pattern upon treatment with trypsin, and in all these cases no additional bands were discerned after trypsin treatment of DPPIVc/benzyl or DPPIVc/benzyl/swa. This result strongly suggests that gross structural alterations did not occur in DPPIV after modification of the carbohydrate chains in the Golgi, the site of action of benzyl-GalNAc and swainsonine. These findings were corroborated by employing another protease, the V8 protease. Fig. 3 shows that the fully glycosylated DPPIV, and the underglycosylated DPPIV glycoforms were cleaved in the same way by the protease. In fact, in each case two major polypeptides were revealed that varied in their apparent molecular masses depending on their underglycosylation pattern. Moreover, the labeling intensities of these glycoforms were in all cases comparable, reminiscent of similar susceptibilities of the various DPPIV glycoforms to the digesting protease. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the folding pattern of DPPIV was not altered due to the variations in the glycosylation pattern in the presence of benzyl-GalNAc, swainsonine, or both. Furthermore, the results are in line with current concepts of protein folding, which have established that major folding events of membrane and secretory proteins including acquisition of a mature, transport-competent form occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (47Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). One type of signals for sorting proteins to the apical surface of epithelial cells, or axon of neurons, is that of a glycolipid anchor. These anchors have been demonstrated to direct proteins to the apical surface of several types of epithelial cells (48Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 49Lipardi C. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Mol. Biol.

Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8048) Google Scholar). Although initially observed with GPI-anchored proteins, association with lipid microdomains as a possible mechanism for apical sorting appears to also occur with proteins that possess a transmembrane domain. Localization of DPPIV to membrane microdomains in Caco-2 cells has been shown in pig intestinal explants. We investigated here the specific association of DPPIV with lipid rafts as a possible sorting mechanism and the link between N- andO-linked glycosylation and the sorting process. Sphingolipids and cholesterol are the major lipid constituents of Triton X-100-insoluble lipid microdomains. Here we analyzed the possible association of DPPIV and the various underglycosylated DPPIV forms with these domains.

https://openalex.org/W2128282422,"Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), has been shown to be activated mainly by soluble fibrillar collagen. Unusually, the kinetics of phosphorylation of the receptor is slow, with maximal phosphorylation observed after 90 min. To understand the reasons for slow phosphorylation of the receptor, we examined several cell lines under different conditions. We confirm that endogenous DDR1 is phosphorylated slowly by collagen in adherent T47D and HCT116 cells. In detached and resuspended cells, collagen induced rapid phosphorylation of DDR1. This was further confirmed with a semiadherent cell line (COLO201) and one that grows as a suspension (K562), both of which express endogenous DDR1. Replating K562 on fibronectin to mimic adherent conditions altered the kinetics of phosphorylation from rapid to slow, similar to those of adherent cells. The slow kinetics of phosphorylation in the adherent state was probably not due to cell-cell contacts because EDTA had no major effect. However, pervanadate in the absence of collagen was able to induce strong DDR1 phosphorylation, indicating that a phosphatase may inhibit or delay the phosphorylation of DDR1. Further, downstream signals after phosphorylation of DDR1 by collagen were not transmitted through the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In addition, a chimeric TrkA-DDR1 receptor failed to become phosphorylated on stimulation with nerve growth factor (NGF), although it dimerized normally. This is the first RTK whose kinetics of phosphorylation is dependent on cellular context. The interaction of the cells with the matrix, rather than cell-cell contact, is probably responsible for the inhibition of phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2041482139,"Nucleolin is one of the most abundant non-ribosomal proteins of the nucleolus. Several studies in vitro have shown that nucleolin is involved in several steps of ribosome biogenesis, including the regulation of rDNA transcription, rRNA processing, and ribosome assembly. However, the different steps of ribosome biogenesis are highly coordinated, and therefore it is not clear to what extent nucleolin is involved in each of these steps. It has been proposed that the interaction of nucleolin with the rDNA sequence and with nascent pre-rRNA leads to the blocking of RNA polymerase I (RNA pol I) transcription. To test this model and to get molecular insights into the role of nucleolin in RNA pol I transcription, we studied the function of nucleolin inXenopus oocytes. We show that injection of a 2–4-fold excess of Xenopus or hamster nucleolin in stage VIXenopus oocytes reduces the accumulation of 40 S pre-rRNA 3-fold, whereas transcription by RNA polymerase II and III is not affected. Direct analysis of rDNA transcription units by electron microscopy reveals that the number of polymerase complexes/rDNA unit is drastically reduced in the presence of increased amounts of nucleolin and corresponds to the level of reduction of 40 S pre-rRNA. Transcription from DNA templates containing various combinations of RNA polymerase I or II promoters in fusion with rDNA or CAT sequences was analyzed in the presence of elevated amounts of nucleolin. It was shown that nucleolin leads to transcription repression from a minimal polymerase I promoter, independently of the nature of the RNA sequence that is transcribed. Therefore, we propose that nucleolin affects RNA pol I transcription by acting directly on the transcription machinery or on the rDNA promoter sequences and not, as previously thought, through interaction with the nascent pre-rRNA.

Ribosomal gene transcription can account for as much as 40% of all cellular transcription and ribosomal RNA for about 80% of the RNA content of living cells (1Hadjiolov A.A. The Nucleolus and Ribosome Biogenesis. Cell Biology Monographs. 12. Springer-Verlag, New York1985Crossref Google Scholar). The different steps of ribosome biogenesis take place in a subcompartment of the nucleus called the nucleolus (2Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 465-471PubMed Google Scholar, 3Melese T. Xue Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 4Scheer U. Hock R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The localization of the different steps of ribosome biogenesis in a single nuclear compartment probably allows an efficient coordination and regulation of ribosome assembly. The formation of mature ribosomes is one of the most complex assembly of ribonucleoparticles involving the interaction of four different RNAs and about 80 ribosomal proteins (5Wool I.G. Chan Y.-L. Glück A. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 685-732Google Scholar). In addition, several nucleolar non-ribosomal proteins are required for this process (6Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Busch H. J.

Telford Press, West Caldwell, NJ1990: 519-559Google Scholar). An ordered interaction of ribosomal and non-ribosomal proteins with pre-rRNA is probably required for the formation of functional ribosomes. The molecular details of this highly integrated process are still largely unknown. The non-ribosomal proteins fibrillarin and nucleolin as well as some ribosomal proteins have been detected on nascent pre-rRNA (9Scheer U. Benavente R. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 10Chooi W.Y. Leiby K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) suggesting that they interact with the pre-rRNA during transcription. These abundant non-ribosomal proteins present in the nucleolus could be involved in the regulation and coordination of early steps of pre-rRNA packaging during transcription and also at later stages for ribosome assembly. Nucleolin is one of the most abundant non-ribosomal proteins of the nucleolus (12Bugler B. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Bouche G. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Eur. J.

It is found within the dense fibrillar component at the site of rDNA transcription and within the peripheral granular component of the nucleolus where rRNA processing occurs (8Olson M.O.J.

This localization suggests that nucleolin could be involved in different aspects of ribosome biogenesis. Indeed, it has been proposed that nucleolin can regulate: (i) transcription of the rDNA genes (17Bouche G. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Bugler B. Amalric F.

Because the N-terminal domain of nucleolin contains acidic regions that may interact with histones in chromatin and the central four RNA-binding domains interact with nascent pre-rRNA, it was proposed that nucleolin may form a bridge between the nascent transcript and chromatin, resulting in the blockage of transcription elongation (17Bouche G. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Bugler B. Amalric F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3025-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Egyhazi E. Pigon A. Chang J.H. Ghaffari S.H. Dreesen T.D. Wellman S.E. Case S.T. Olson M.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We used the Xenopus oocyte system to test this model. We followed the transcriptional activity of the endogenous rDNA promoter or of minigenes and the maturation of rRNA in the presence of increased amount of nucleolin. We show that injection of nucleolin in stage VI oocytes specifically affects RNA pol I transcription and pre-rRNA maturation. Observation of ribosomal RNA transcription units by electron microscopy and the use of several chimeric minigenes provided direct evidence that an elevated amount of nucleolin down-regulates rDNA transcription independently of the RNA sequence that is transcribed. The pol I1-rDNA plasmid (identical to pXLS108f (30Firek S. Read C. Smith D.R. Moss T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3777-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)) was derived from pXL108f (60Bell S.P. Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It contains a complete 6.6-kb Xenopus laevis rDNA spacer fragment with a truncated rDNA gene. A SalI linker was inserted into the 5′-ETS (position +116 to +136) to distinguish RNA transcribed from the plasmid and endogenous rRNA. pol II-CAT (pCMV-CAT) has a complete chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene cloned downstream the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (61Boshart M. Weber F. Jahn G. Dorsch-Hasler K. Fleckenstein B. Schaffner W. Cell. 1985; 1: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (851) Google Scholar). pol I-CAT was constructed by inserting the CAT cDNA (PCR fragment obtained with primers 5′-GAGGCCCTTTCGTCTTCTTACGCCCCGCCCTGCCACTCATCG-3′ and 5′-TAGGGGAAGACCGGCCCATGGAGAAAAAAATCACTGGATATACC-3′) between theBbsI restriction sites of pXLS108f (6645-bp fragment, which contains the complete rDNA intergenic spacer with distal promoters and enhancer repeats and all the promoter sequences up to +14). For the pol II-rDNA plasmid, the BbsI 1745-bp fragment from pXLS108f (rDNA sequence from +14 to +1758) was inserted into theSmaI site of pspCMV-SV40poly(A) vector. This last plasmid was constructed by inserting the 590-bpXhoI-HindIII fragment of the CMV promoter and the 900-bp EcoRI-BglII fragment containing the SV40-poly(A) signal from the CMV-CAT plasmid (62Harland R. Misher L. Development. 1988; 102: 837-852PubMed Google Scholar) in the corresponding sites of psp72 (Promega). pol I mini-CAT plasmid corresponds to thePstI-EcoRI fragment of pol I-CAT plasmid (−308 to +216) cloned between the PstI-EcoRI sites of pUC9. This minigene contains the pol I minimal promoter and the T3 terminator (−308 to +14) but lacks all rDNA intergenic enhancer sequences. Nucleolin was purified from exponentially grown CHO cells (Computer Cell Culture Center) or from Xenopus A6 cells as described previously (11Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F.

For the labeling of nucleolin with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC), 100 μg of nucleolin was incubated with 7.5 μg of TRITC (10m excess of TRITC) for 2 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 500 μl of 100 mm borate buffer. The excess TRITC was then removed using a Microcon 10 unit (Amicon), and protein was concentrated in 50 μl of TMK buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl) before injection. Western blot analysis to detect the CHO-injected nucleolin was performed using a polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to the C-terminal domain of nucleolin (p50) (this antibody does not react with Xenopus nucleolin in Western blot analysis but reacts with the Xenopus protein in immunofluorescence studies). For the detection of endogenous nucleolin (immunofluorescence studies), we used a polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant polypeptide corresponding to the four RBD of Xenopus nucleolin (Xlp40). This antibody reacts with theXenopus and CHO-nucleolin proteins in Western blot and immunofluorescence studies. Ovaries from X. laevis female were surgically removed, cut into pieces, and treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase type VIII (Sigma) in calcium-free OR2 buffer (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.8)) for 45 min at room temperature. Oocytes were washed 8–10 times in MBSH buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2). Stage VI oocytes were selected and left to recover overnight at 18 °C before injection. In vivo RNA labeling experiments were performed by injecting 18.4 nl of [α32P]CTP at 20 μCi/μl, 800 Ci/mmol into the cytoplasm of each oocyte. Nucleolin was injected into the oocyte nucleus (23 nl of 3 mg/ml) 1–12 h prior to RNA labeling or plasmid injections. Plasmids (pol I-rDNA at 50 μg/ml and pol II-CAT at 200 μg/ml) are injected (23 nl) into the oocyte nucleus or as indicated in the figure legend (Fig. 9). Inhibition of polymerase I transcription was obtained by injection of actinomycin D 1 mg/ml (23 nl). Oocyte nuclei were individually hand-isolated in freshly prepared 5:1 isolation medium (83 mm NaCl, 17 mm KCl, 6.5 mmNa2HPO4, 3.5 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The nuclear envelope was removed using a pair of jeweler's forceps and a fine needle, and the nuclear content was pipetted and washed briefly in freshly prepared dispersal medium (20.7 mm NaCl, 4.3 mm KCl, 1.6 mmNa2HPO4, 0.9 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01 CaCl2, 0.1% paraformaldehyde). The nuclear content was then transferred to a drop of dispersal medium placed into a spreading chamber constructed on a polylysine-coated microscope slide (for details see Ref. 64Gall J.G. Murphy C. Callan H.G. Wu Z.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 149-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Slides were centrifuged at 3600 × g for 1 h and then fixed by immersion in PBS + 2% formaldehyde. Spreading chambers were removed and immunofluorescence staining performed as follows: 1 h incubation with the primary antibody in PBS + 1% BSA (1/50000 for Xlp40, 1/200 for A17, 1/10 for 72B9), briefly washed with PBS + 1% BSA, and then incubated 1 h with the secondary antibodies in PBS + 1% BSA (Texas Red-coupled anti-rabbit for Xlp40, fluorescein-coupled anti-human for A17, and fluorescein-coupled anti-mouse for 72B9). The preparations were then washed with PBS and incubated in DAPI (0.2 μg/ml) for 30 min. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope using a 63× oil immersion objective. Chromatin spreading was performed mainly as described previously (65Osheim Y.N. Beyer A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 471-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All pH levels were adjusted using a 13 mm sodium tetraborate solution. Briefly, four oocyte nuclei were hand-isolated in 75 mm KCl, pH 8, and dispersed into 80 μl of pH 9 water for 15–20 min. 50 μl of a 100 mm sucrose, 3.6% formalin, pH 8.7, solution was added, and the solution was allowed to disperse for 5 more min. 60 μl of this solution was then layered onto an 80-μl centrifuge chamber containing a freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated grid in 20 μl of sucrose/formalin solution. After centrifugation at 2500 ×g (20 min), grids were collected and incubated for 30 s in a diluted Kodak Photo-Flo solution (three drops in 50 ml of water). Grids were then allowed to dry before rotary shadowing with platinum at an angle of 5–10°. For each experimental point, five oocytes were pooled and stored at −20 °C. Oocytes were homogenized in 500 μl of RNA extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma)) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Total RNA was extracted with phenol-water (3.75:1, v/v) and precipitated with 0.8 vol. of isopropanol. When oocytes were injected with a plasmid an additional step was added. After the isopropanol precipitation, nucleic acids were resuspended in 50 μl of sterile water and 25 μl of LiCl, 10 m. RNA was precipitated for 1 h on ice. After centrifugation, RNAs were washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 4 μl of sterile water per oocyte. RNAs were resolved on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels (6.5% formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA) for 12–14 h at 75 V at 4 °C with 1.6% formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA as running buffer. For S1 nuclease experiments, 1 equivalent oocyte RNA (4 μl) was precipitated with 10 ng of 5′ radiolabeled probe and then incubated in 20 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mm Pipes (pH 6.4), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 80% formamide) for 10 min at 90 °C and overnight at 55 °C. S1 nuclease (120 units, Promega) and its reaction buffer were added to the hybridized sample and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, protected RNA fragments were resolved on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel. For primer extension experiments, 1 equivalent oocyte RNA (4 μl) was incubated with 1 ng of 5′ radiolabeled primer in 7.5 μl of hybridization buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7), 50 mmKCl) for 3 min at 90 °C and allowed to cool down slowly to 45 °C. Reverse transcriptase (MMLV, 200 units, Promega) was added with 5 μl of extension buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP) and incubated for 1 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped with 30 μl of the STOP buffer (300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), ethanol-precipitated, and loaded on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel. Gels were dried, exposed on a PhosphorImager screen for quantification, and autoradiographed. Two rDNA probes were used for S1 nuclease experiments. The first correspond to the 441-bp PstI-SalI fragment of p8wt and contains the first 125 nt of Xenopus 5′-ETS and the 305-nt upstream sequence corresponding to the 40 S promoter and adjacent terminator. The protected fragment is 125 nt and is specific to the pol I-rDNA minigenes. The second probe corresponds to the 491-bpPstI-NotI fragment of the pXCr7 plasmid. It contains the first 171 nt of the Xenopus 5′-ETS and the 316-nt upstream sequence corresponding to the 40 S promoter adjacent terminator. This probe is specific to the endogenous rDNA genes and protects a fragment of 171 nt. The DNA fragments were dephosphorylated and 32P 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ32P]ATP. The CAT primers sequence for primer extension experiments were 5′-ATCAACGGTGGTATATCCAGTG-3′ for the pol II-CAT plasmid and 5′-ACATGGATATTGGTCTGGCA-3′ for the pol I-CAT and pol I mini-CAT plasmids, which hybridize to the 5′-end of the CAT RNA. Western blot analysis indicates that about 20 ng of nucleolin is present in stage VI oocytes (data not shown). Because of this large stock of endogenous nucleolin, we were unable to over-express significantly the amount of nucleolin by microinjection in the oocyte of nucleolin mRNA or of an expression vector (data not shown). To overcome this difficulty, we injected highly purified nucleolin from hamster (CHO) or X. laevis cells (Fig.1). After the injection of nucleolin (∼4-fold increase of nucleolin/oocyte) into the oocyte nucleus, RNA was labeled by the injection of [α-32P]CTP. Total RNA was then extracted at various times and run on an agarose gel (Fig. 1,B and C). With both nucleolins, a drastic effect on 40 S accumulation and on its processing was observed. The amount of 40 S pre-rRNA produced in presence of exogenous nucleolin was reduced about 3–4-fold with both proteins. Furthermore, the 40 S pre-rRNA produced in the presence of excess nucleolin was not mature but instead was apparently simply degraded, producing a smear below the 40 S pre-rRNA (Fig. 1, B, lanes 10 and12, and C, lanes 6 and 8). The smear below the 40 S pre-rRNA produced in oocytes injected withXenopus nucleolin is not as apparent as with CHO nucleolin, however; and even with a longer labeling time, no significant accumulation of mature 28 S RNA was observed (data not shown), indicating that the 40 S pre-rRNA was degraded. However, in some experiments (see Fig. 1 C) some 18 S mature RNA could be observed only when Xenopus nucleolin was injected. Incubation of purified proteins (from Xenopus or CHO cells) with in vitro transcribed 5′-ETS rRNA did not show any degradation of the RNA, indicating that these proteins are not contaminated by a ribonuclease activity (data not show). To determine whether these effects were specific for the nucleolin proteins, mock injection of buffer or other proteins such as the nucleolar Nop10 protein (27Henras A. Henry Y. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Gelugne J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. EMBO J. 1998; 7: 7078-7090Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or BSA was performed (Fig.2). Injection of a large molar excess of Nop10 and BSA compared with nucleolin had no effect either on the production of 40 S or on its processing. These experiments demonstrated that excess of nucleolin in the oocyte has a profound and specific effect on the production of mature rRNA species. All experiments that follow have been performed with hamster and Xenopusnucleolin. For clarity of the figures, only one set of data is shown for each experiment.Figure 2Effect of control proteins on ribosomal RNA production. A, 23 nl of Nop 10 protein (0.8 mg/ml), BSA (5 mg/ml), or Xenopus nucleolin (1 mg/ml) was injected inXenopus oocytes nuclei. This represents a 5.5 molar excess of Nop 10- and BSA-injected protein compared with Xenopusnucleolin injection. After a 12-h incubation, RNA was labeled by microinjection of [α-32P]CTP in oocyte cytoplasm. Pools of five oocytes were taken after 1, 3, or 13 h, and was RNA extracted. The RNA from one equivalent oocyte was resolved on a 1% agarose denaturing gel and run for 14 h at 4 °C. The gel was dried then autoradiographed. B, 1 μl of each protein preparation was resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reduction in the 40 S pre-rRNA pool could be the result of a reduction of rRNA transcription by RNA pol I, an increase of 40 S turnover, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, the stability of the 40 S pre-rRNA was measured in the presence or absence of injected nucleolin. CHO nucleolin was first injected into oocyte nuclei, and then the RNA was labeled for 1 h before the inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D. Under these conditions, we observed that the level of rRNA transcribed in the presence of nucleolin was reduced about 3 times (Fig.3 A, compare lane 8with lane 1). Total RNA was isolated at various times after drug treatment and analyzed on an agarose gel (Fig. 3). Quantification of the disappearance of 40 S pre-rRNA in the absence (lanes 1–7) and presence (lanes 8–14) of injected nucleolin indicated that nucleolin did not promote a faster decay of the 40 S pre-rRNA (Fig. 3 C). Instead, a slight increase in the half-life of this precursor was observed. In control oocytes, the stability of the 40 S is determined mainly by its rate of processing because the disappearance of the 40 S is quantitatively correlated with the appearance of the mature 18 and 28 S RNA. In injected oocytes, the half-life of the 40 S seems to be determined by its rate of degradation because no intermediate precursors were detected. Because the half-life of 40 S rRNA is identical in control and injected oocytes, the decrease in 40 S pre-rRNA accumulation must have been the direct consequence of a reduction in RNA pol I transcription. To further characterize the role of nucleolin on RNA pol I transcription, we first tested the efficiency with which nucleolin repressed RNA pol I transcription. Different amounts of CHO nucleolin were injected into the oocyte nuclei, and after 12 h RNA was labeled for 4 h before analysis (Fig.4 A). Quantification of 40 S pre-rRNA synthesized in the presence of nucleolin showed a linear and rapid decrease of RNA pol I transcription (Fig. 4 B). A 3-fold repression of transcription was obtained with the injection of as little as 0.5 pmol of nucleolin (corresponding to a 2–3-fold increase in nucleolin in the oocyte). The experiment also indicated that the effect of nucleolin on rRNA maturation is very efficient. The injection of as little as 0.4 pmol (2-fold increase in nucleolin in the oocyte) is sufficient to inhibit the maturation of all newly synthesized rRNA. Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction of control and injected oocytes showed that injected CHO nucleolin (1.15 pmol) is retained in the nucleus and is stable during the experiment (data not shown). To further characterize the specificity of the repression of RNA pol I transcription mediated by nucleolin, we examined the effect of nucleolin on RNA pol III transcription. Oocytes were injected with nucleolin as described previously, and RNA was labeled for 12 h. Analysis of these RNAs on a 1.0% agarose gel (Fig.5 A) indicated that the level of 40 S in nucleolin-injected oocytes was reduced 3-fold compared with buffer-injected oocytes (compare lanes 1 and 2) as already shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The same RNAs were also analyzed on a 6% acrylamide-urea gel to detect the low molecular weight 5 S and tRNA RNA pol III transcripts. In control oocytes the rRNA 12 and 5.8 S maturation products and the RNA pol III 5 S and tRNAs transcripts were clearly detected (Fig. 5 B, lane 3). In contrast, in oocytes injected with nucleolin (lane 4) only, the RNA pol III transcripts (5 S and tRNAs) were observed and found at a level similar to that in control oocytes, indicating that neither their transcription nor their maturation had been affected by nucleolin. The absence of 12 and 5.8 S rRNA in nucleolin-injected oocytes (lane 4) further demonstrated that the 40 S pre-rRNA was not mature but was instead degraded, in agreement with previous experiments. RNA polymerase II transcription is weak in stage VI oocytes, and transcripts are generally stable. For these reasons we have been unable to find a suitable system to determine whether the injection of nucleolin affects pol II transcription of the oocyte genes. To overcome this difficulty, we used the RNA pol II minigene, pol II-CAT, encoding the CMV promoter in fusion with the CAT gene (Fig.6 A). This plasmid, which is commonly used to study regulation of pol II transcription inXenopus oocytes, was injected in the oocyte 1 h after nucleolin. Transcription from the CMV promoter was assayed by primer extension 8 and 22 h after plasmid injection. Nucleolin had no effect on the steady state level of CAT RNA (Fig. 6 B). Thus, nucleolin appears to exert its repressive effect solely at the level of RNA pol I transcription.Figure 6Nucleolin does not affect polymerase II transcription. A, schematic representation of the pol II-CAT minigene injected in the oocyte nuclei. The CAT gene is inserted downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV). The transcription level is assayed by reverse transcription (RT). B, pol II-CAT plasmid (4.5 ng) is injected in nuclei of oocytes that have been injected with 1.15 pmol of CHO nucleolin (lanes 3 and 5) or not (lanes 2 and 4). At 8 and 22 h after the injection of the pol II-CAT plasmid, total RNA is extracted and analyzed by primer extension. C, PhosphorImager quantification is reported on the graph. The transcriptional level in the presence of nucleolin has been determined in comparison with the control oocytes (100%) for each time point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

We characterized a major outer membrane protein, KdgM, whose synthesis is strongly induced in the presence of pectic derivatives. The corresponding gene was characterized. Analysis of transcriptional fusions showed that the kdgM expression is controlled by the general repressor of pectinolytic genes, KdgR, by the repressor of hexuronate catabolism genes, ExuR, by the pectinase gene repressor, PecS, and by catabolite repression via the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) transcriptional activator. A kdgM mutant is unable to grow on oligogalacturonides longer than trimers, and its virulence is affected. Electrophysiological experiments with planar lipid bilayers showed that KdgM behaves like a voltage-dependent porin that is slightly selective for anions and that exhibits fast block in the presence of trigalacturonate. In contrast to most porins, KdgM seems to be monomeric. KdgM has no homology with currently known porins, but proteins similar to KdgM are present in several bacteria.

Microbiol. 1998; 21: 384-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), is mainly due to their ability to macerate the major component of plant cell walls, pectin. Pectin consists of α-1,4-linked galacturonate residues (PGA)1 with some methyl-esterified and acetyl-esterified residues. Erwinia chrysanthemi (synonym Pectobacterium chrysanthemi), which causes soft-rot disease of various plants, is able to use pectin as a carbon source for growth. Pectin catabolism involves a variety of pectinases, including esterases and depolymerases (Fig.1), among which endo-pectate lyases play a crucial role in the soft-rot disease (2Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Condemine G. Nasser W. Reverchon S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 213-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 3Barras F. Van Gijsegem F. Chatterjee A.K. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1994; 32: 201-234Crossref Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Pectinases are secreted in the extracellular medium by a type II secretion pathway, the Out system (4Condemine G. Dorel C. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Robert-Baudouy J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3199-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The end products of pectin degradation by these extracellular pectinases are mainly dimers to tetramers of galacturonides (GA2 to GA4) with some longer oligomers. Most oligogalacturonides (GAn) resulting from a lyase activity have a 4,5-unsaturated bond at their non-reducing end (6Preston J.F. Rice J.D. Ingram L.O. Keen N.T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Roy C. Kester H. Visser J. Shevchik V. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Robert-Baudouy J. Benen J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3705-3709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pectin degradation products are known to enter the E. chrysanthemi cells (8Collmer A. Bateman D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3920-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9San Francisco M.J.D. Xiang Z. Keeman R.W. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1996; 9: 144-147Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Enzymes able to cleave GAn exist inside the bacteria. GA4 is the best substrate for the periplasmic exo-pectate lyase PelX, but this enzyme is also able to degrade longer oligomers (10Shevchik V.E. Kester H.C. Benen J.A. Visser J. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1652-1663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GA3and GA4 are good substrates for the cytoplasmic pectate lyase PelW, and GA2 is the preferential substrate for the cytoplasmic oligogalacturonate lyase Ogl (11Shevchik V.E. Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. HugouvieuxCotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3912-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After being internalized into the cytoplasm, GAn are catabolized by PelW and Ogl into monomers of GA and 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate, which are next degraded into 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate and then into pyruvate and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde, products that finally enter the general cellular metabolism (2Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Condemine G. Nasser W. Reverchon S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 213-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 11Shevchik V.E. Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. HugouvieuxCotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3912-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two transport systems allowing GAn translocation through the inner membrane, TogMNAB and TogT, have been characterized (12Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Blot N. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 41: 1113-1123Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 41: 1125-1132Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). TogMNAB is a member of the carbohydrate uptake transporter-1 family, included in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. TogT is a member of the glycoside-pentoside-hexuronide transporter family. The simultaneous inactivation of both transporters is required to prevent growth with pectin as the sole carbon source (13Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 41: 1125-1132Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The transport of GAn through the outer membrane is the only step of the pectin catabolism pathway that remains unknown. In Gram-negative bacteria, carbohydrates enter the periplasm by passing through porins. Porins form water-filled channels that permit the diffusion of hydrophilic solutes across the outer membrane. They are divided in two classes as follows: (i) the non-specific porins of the general bacterial porin family, such as OmpF and OmpC ofEscherichia coli, permit the diffusion of molecules below about 600 Da and are responsible for the exclusion limit of the outer membrane (14Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Koebnik R. Locher K.P. van Gelder P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar); (ii) the substrate-specific porins can facilitate the diffusion of specific substrates. Complex sugars can enter the cell by specific porins, like the maltoporin LamB of E. coli orSalmonella typhimurium which is specific for maltose and maltodextrin uptake (16Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Robert-Baudouy J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 248-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the identification of a new porin, KdgM, involved in GAn translocation across the outer membrane of E. chrysanthemi. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are described in Table I. E. chrysanthemi and E. coli cells were grown at 30 and 37 °C, respectively, in LB or M63 medium (25Miller J.H. Experiments In Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-435Google Scholar) supplemented with a carbon source at 2 g·l−1 for glycerol and glucose, 1 g·l−1 for GA, GA2, and GA3, and 4 g·l−1 for PGA and pectin. 0.1 mmCaCl2 was added with PGA and pectin. PGA (grade II), pectin, GA, and saturated GA2 and GA3were from Sigma. The mixture of oligogalacturonides, containing mainly unsaturated trimers to pentamers with longer oligomers, was obtained by digestion of PGA with the E. chrysanthemi pectate lyase PelL, according to Roy et al. (7Roy C. Kester H. Visser J. Shevchik V. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Robert-Baudouy J. Benen J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3705-3709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: kanamycin (Km) 50 mg·l−1, ampicillin (Ap) 50 mg·l−1, and chloramphenicol 20 mg·l−1. For growth in conditions of oxygen limitation, fumarate was added at 2 g·l−1, and the culture was covered with paraffin oil. Media with high and low osmolarity were obtained by addition of 0.3 m NaCl and by 4-fold dilution of M63 medium, respectively.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrain/plasmidGenotype/phenotypeOriginE. chrysanthemi 3937 derivativesA71 (L37)lmrTc lacZ exuR17A350 (L2)lmrTc lacZ17A576lmrTc lacZ argG kdgK18A837lmrTc lacZ kdgR19A1077lmrTc lacZ kdgR∷Cm19A1524lmrTc lacZ pecS∷Cm20A1851lmrTc lacZ outD∷CmLaboratory collectionA2174lmrTc lacZ pecT∷Cm21A2507lmrTc lacZ crp∷Cm22A3009lmrTc lacZ expR∷Cm23A3573lmrTc lacZ kdgM∷uidA-KmThis workA3576lmrTc lacZ kdgR∷CmkdgM∷uidA-KmThis workA3577lmrTc lacZ outD∷CmkdgM∷uidA-KmThis workA3724lacZ exuR kdgM∷uidA-KmThis workA3725lmrTc lacZ pecS∷CmkdgM∷uidA-KmThis workA3726lmrTc lacZ pecT∷CmkdgM∷uidA-KmThis workA3727lmrTc lacZ expR∷CmkdgM∷uidA-KmThis workA3728lmrTc lacZ crp∷CmkdgM∷uidA-KmThis workA4040lmrTc lacZ kdgR∷CmpecS∷ApkdgM∷uidA-KmThis workA4041lmrTc lacZ kdgR∷CmexuR∷ApkdgM∷uidA-KmThis workOther Erwinia strainsEC16E. chrysanthemiLaboratory collection1891E. chrysanthemiLaboratory collectionSCRI449E. amylovoraLaboratory collectionSCRI31E. carotovora subsp.atrosepticaLaboratory collectionSCRI52–476E. carotovora subsp.betavasculorumLaboratory collectionSCRI193E. carotovora subsp.carotovoraLaboratory collectionSCRI56–487E. carotovora subsp.odoriferaLaboratory collectionSCRI51–440E. cypripediiLaboratory collectionE. coli strainsMC4100araD139 Δ(argF-lac)U169 rspL150 relA1 flbB5301 deoC1 ptsF25 rsbRLaboratory collectionPHL646MC4100ompR∷Tn10Laboratory collectionNM522supE, thi-1 Δ(lac-proAB) Δ(hsdSM-mcrB)5 (rk−, m k−) [F′proAB lacIqZΔM15]Laboratory collectionPlasmidspROU2ogl, kdgR, kduI, kduD, pelW, togMNAB, kdgM… on a 30-kb fragment in pULB113, ApR, TcR, KmR24pUC18ApRStratagenepKMkdgM on a 7.5-kb Sau3A fragment in pUC18This workpKM2BssHII-SalI deletion of pKMThis work Open table in a new tab KdgM was extracted from the E. chrysanthemi kdgR strain A837 after growth at 30 °C in LB to an absorbance of 0.8 at 600 nm. The cells were harvested, disrupted in a French press in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the crude cell membrane fraction was sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The membranes were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, incubated for 30 min with gentle agitation at room temperature, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant was loaded onto a 15% preparative Tris glycine SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the band corresponding to KdgM was cut out and crushed, and proteins were extracted by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3% SDS. The protein extract was used to immunize a rabbit to obtain the KdgM antiserum. KdgM was also prepared from the recombinant E. coli strain PHL646/pKM2. Cells were grown at 30 °C in LB with Ap to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and the culture was grown at 30 °C for 4 h. The crude cell membrane fraction was prepared as above. The membranes were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5%N-lauroylsarcosyl (Sigma), incubated for 1 h with gentle agitation at room temperature, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h.

The same treatment was performed with the resulting non-soluble fraction resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS. Supernatant was loaded onto a 20 × 20-cm 10% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the band containing KdgM was cut out and crushed, and proteins were extracted by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS. KdgM was further purified by extraction after migration from a 20 × 20-cm 15% Tris glycine SDS-PAGE. These extracts were used for electrophysiological experiments. Tris glycine SDS-PAGE was usually performed according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) with 15 and 0.4% of acrylamide and bisacrylamide, respectively. Protocols for electrophoresis, protein staining with Coomassie G-250, semi-dry transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane, Western blotting, and immunological screening of colonies with KdgM antiserum were performed according to Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE was adapted from Schägger and von Jagow (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

For immunodetection, the KdgM antiserum was diluted 1:5000 and purified by incubation for 1 h, at room temperature, with NM522 and A3573 cellular lysates. The secondary antibody, an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G peroxidase conjugate (Sigma), was revealed with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subcellular fractionation was performed using E. chrysanthemi kdgR cells grown to early stationary phase after disruption with a French press. Membrane fractionation was carried out by sucrose density gradient centrifugation in a flotation gradient (29Possot O. Pugsley A.P. Mol.

The membrane was stained with 0.5% Ponceau S, and the KdgM band was cut out and subjected to N-terminal analysis by Edman degradation at Institut de Biologie et Chemie des Protéines (Lyon, France). E. chrysanthemi strains were grown at 30 °C in LB and LB + PGA to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm. Cells were washed with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and incubated in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1% formaldehyde for 5 or 30 min at room temperature. After a second washing, extracts were either incubated for 10 min at 30 °C or boiled for 20 min, separated by Tris glycine SDS-PAGE, and submitted to immunodetection. The KdgR protein was used as a control of dimerization (32Nasser W. Reverchon S. Robert-Baudouy J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The purified protein KdgM (500 ng) was added to 2 ml of 500 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, and 33 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucoside buffer containing 1 mg of sonicated lipids (asolectin from soybean, type IV-S). After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, 160 mg wet weight of Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) were added to the suspension to remove the detergent. Incubation was carried out for 4 h at room temperature. The Bio Beads were discarded, and the suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 344,000 × g at 4 °C. The proteoliposomes were resuspended in 0.1 ml of 500 mm KCl, 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.4. Bilayers were formed from a solution of asolectin lipids dissolved in n-decane (30 mg·ml−1) across a 250-μm diameter hole. Proteoliposomes (3 ng of protein per ml, final concentration) were added to the cis compartment. Fusion was induced by imposing a salt gradient between the two chambers as follows: 800 mmKCl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, in the ciscompartment versus 100 mm KCl, 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.4, in the trans compartment. The bilayer set up was connected to the external circuit through salt bridges with Ag/AgCl electrodes. Unitary currents were recorded using an Axon 200B patch clamp amplifier and stored on digital audio tape (Biologic DTR 1200 recorder). Recordings were filtered at 1 kHz through a 4-pole bessel filter and digitized off line at 2 kHz. The membrane potential refers to the potential of the cis side minus the potential of the trans side. Plate assays for detection of secreted enzymes were performed as described previously (34Ji J.W. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Robert-Baudouy J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 793-802Google Scholar). Pectate lyase activity was determined by monitoring the appearance of unsaturated oligomers at 230 nm (35Tardy F. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2503-2511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-glucuronidase activity was measured by monitoring the cleavage ofp-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucuronide at 405 nm (36Bardonnet N. Blanco C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 72: 243-247PubMed Google Scholar). The alginate lyase activity was determined by monitoring the appearance of unsaturated oligomers at 230 nm according to Preiss and Ashwell (37Preiss J. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 309-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assays were performed on toluenized extracts of cells grown to early stationary phase. Chicory leaves were slightly wounded with a pipette tip prior to inoculation. At least 15 leaves were infected using 106 bacteria per inoculation site. After incubation in a dew chamber for 24 h at 30 °C, the length of rotted tissue was measured. Transduction with the generalized transducing phage phi-EC2 was performed according to Résibois et al. (38Résibois A. Colet M. Faelen M. Schoonejans E. Toussaint A. Virology. 1984; 137: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Preparation of plasmid or chromosomal DNA or RNA, restriction digestions, ligations, transformations, and DNA or RNA electrophoresis were all carried out as described previously (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA purification kits were from Qiagen (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit) and Prolabo (DNA Purification Kit). Cloning of kdgM gene was performed by screening an E. chrysanthemi gene library constructed in pUC18 (23Nasser W. Bouillant M.L. Salmond G. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1391-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed by Genome Express SA (Grenoble, France). ThekdgM nucleotide sequence accession number is AJ320226 in the EMBL, GenBankTM, and DDBJ nucleotide sequence data bases. The kdgM::uidA transcriptional fusion was constructed by introduction of the uidA-Km cassette, which carries the β-glucuronidase gene, into the PinAI site of the kdgM coding region. The fusion was introduced into the E. chrysanthemi chromosome by marker exchange recombination after growth in low phosphate concentration medium containing Km, as described by Roeder and Collmer (39Roeder D.L. Collmer A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from the E. coli strain NM522/pROU2 (24Reverchon S. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2203-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30 °C in LB, with Ap and GA, to an absorbance of 0.8 at 600 nm. pROU2 RNA was used as the matrix for primer extension experiments (AMV-RT Primer Extension Kit from Stratagene). The primer GCATTGACGCTAACCAGAGATGCAACAGCC located 20 nucleotides downstream from the initiation codon was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]dATP. The kdgMregulatory region was amplified by PCR using the primers CTTCCAGCGTCAAGCTTACCGTATTCTGAAGCGCG and CCAGAGCATTGACGCTATCTAGAGATGAACAGCC that carry sequence modifications (underlined letters) to includeHindIII and XbaI restriction sites. The 356-nucleotide fragment was digested with HindIII, labeled by incorporating [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci·mmol−1) with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Band shift assays were performed with the KdgR-, CRP-, and PecS-purified proteins (32Nasser W. Reverchon S. Robert-Baudouy J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Reverchon S. Mol.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The labeled DNA fragment (50,000 cpm) and 5–100 nm of the purified regulator were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of binding buffer, and the reaction mixtures were submitted to electrophoresis on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, as described previously (33Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Praillet T. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Bands were detected by autoradiography. The KdgR repressor controls the synthesis of all the genes of the pectic degradation pathway (41Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 42: 39-46Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Analysis by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE of the membrane proteins of wild type and kdgRstrains of E. chrysanthemi showed a protein strongly expressed in the kdgR mutant (Fig.2 A). Synthesis of this protein, named KdgM, is also strongly induced when bacteria are grown in the presence of pectin or pectin derivatives, such as PGA or GA (data not shown). To localize KdgM more precisely, outer and inner membranes of the kdgR and the wild type strains were separated by centrifugation on a sucrose density gradient. KdgM was observed only in the outer membrane protein fraction (data not shown). A KdgM antiserum was obtained and used with extracts of various bacteria. A cross-reacting protein was detected in some pectinolyticErwiniae, such as Erwinia cypripedii orErwinia carotovora subspecies, but not in the non-pectinolytic Erwinia amylovora (Fig. 2 C). Screening of anE. chrysanthemi gene library with the KdgM antiserum allowed for the isolation of a plasmid, pKM, which carries a 10-kb DNA fragment encoding KdgM. The region containing the kdgM gene was reduced to a 1.3-kb BssHII-Eco47III fragment in plasmid pKM2. The nucleotide sequence of theBssHII-Eco47III DNA fragment was determined. A single complete open reading frame was identified. It encodes a 236-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 26,726 Da. A potential Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGGAA) lies 7 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon (Fig.3 A). The kdgMtranscription start was determined, by primer extension experiments (data not shown), to be 70 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon. It is preceded by a −10 Pribnow box (TAAAAT) and a −35 region (ATCACA) that have 5/6 and 4/6 nucleotides of the ς70promoter consensus. Farther upstream is located a short GC-rich inverted repeat, with a calculated free energy of formation of −67 kJ·mol−1, followed by a run of T residues, which is typical for a rho-independent transcription termination site (Fig.3 A). Analysis of the DNA sequences situated on each side ofkdgM enabled us to localize this gene downstream from the pelW-togMNAB operon (12Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Blot N. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 41: 1113-1123Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and upstream from thepaeX gene (Fig. 4), encoding an esterase. 2N. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat and V. E.

Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was confirmed by the N-terminal sequencing of the protein purified from E. chrysanthemi membranes. KdgM C-terminal primary structure, with its Phe terminal residue, is characteristic of outer membrane proteins (42Struyve M. Moons M. Tommassen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The mature KdgM protein has a calculated molecular mass of 24,688 Da. The KdgM sequence was compared with other amino acid sequences deposited in the data banks and against translated complete and incomplete bacterial genomes. The best homologues are twoYersinia pestis proteins, which we named KdgM and KdgN, both with 64% identity to KdgM (TableII). E. carotovora,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas syringae pv.tomato,S. typhimurium,Salmonella paratyphimurium,Vibrio halioticoli, and E. coli possess proteins that have less similarity with KdgM (TableII). Among these proteins only one has been assigned a putative activity, the alginate lyase AlyVGIII from V. halioticoli. 3I. Sugimura, T. Sawabe, and Y. Ezura, unpublished observations.

https://openalex.org/W2026617111,"Dock, the Drosophila orthologue of Nck, is an adaptor protein that is known to function in axonal guidance paradigms in the fly including proper development of neuronal connections in photoreceptor cells and axonal tracking in Bolwig's organ. To develop a better understanding of axonal guidance at the molecular level, we purified proteins in a complex with the SH2 domain of Dock from fly Schneider 2 cells. A protein designated p145 was identified and shown to be a tyrosine kinase with sequence similarity to mammalian Cdc-42-associated tyrosine kinases. We demonstrate that Drosophila Ack (DAck) can be co-immunoprecipitated with Dock and DSH3PX1 from fly cell extracts. The domains responsible for the in vitro interaction between DrosophilaAck and Dock were identified, and direct protein-protein interactions between complex members were established. We conclude that DSH3PX1 is a substrate for DAck in vivo and in vitro and define one of the major in vitro sites of DSH3PX1 phosphorylation to be Tyr-56. Tyr-56 is located within the SH3 domain of DSH3PX1, placing it in an important position for regulating the binding of proline-rich targets. We demonstrate that Tyr-56 phosphorylation by DAck diminishes the DSH3PX1 SH3 domain interaction with the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein while enabling DSH3PX1 to associate with Dock. Furthermore, when Tyr-56 is mutated to aspartate or glutamate, the binding to Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein is abrogated. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of DSH3PX1 by DAck targets this sorting nexin to a protein complex that includes Dock, an adaptor protein important for axonal guidance.

Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a particular guidance signal may act as either a repellent or an attractant dependent solely upon the activity of the intracellular signal transduction pathways of the neuron (2Ming G.L. Song H.J. Berninger B. Holt C.E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1225-1235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding how individual neurons translate extracellular signals into the cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for the directed movement of their growth cones requires the molecular identification of protein-protein interactions within the guidance receptor complex.Previous reports have proposed that Dock,1 theDrosophila orthologue of the mammalian SH3/SH2 adaptor protein Nck, links guidance signals to changes in the actin cytoskeleton in photoreceptor growth cones (3Garrity P.A. Rao Y. Salecker I. McGlade J. Pawson T. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Recently, using the epitope-tagged SH2 domain of Dock, we biochemically purified five proteins (molecular masses of 270, 145, 74, 69, and 63 kDa), which are present in a putative complex with the SH2 domain of Dock. Further characterization revealed that p270 is a novel receptor-like protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and shares extensive sequence similarity to the human Down'sSyndrome cell adhesionmolecule (Dscam). Additionally, we demonstrated that Dscam lies upstream of Dock signaling and is important for normal axonal pathfinding in the developing nervous system in the fly (4Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar).The second protein that was characterized from the collection of Dock SH2 domain-interacting proteins was the 63-kDa protein identified as the SH3 and PX domains containing protein, DSH3PX1 (5Worby C. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J. Kruger R. Muda M. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41782-41789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DSH3PX1 is a member of the sorting nexin family and is able to interact with both Dock and Dscam (5Worby C. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J. Kruger R. Muda M. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41782-41789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Importantly, we also demonstrated that the SH3 domain of DSH3PX1 interacts with Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP), a protein involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton (5Worby C. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J. Kruger R. Muda M. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41782-41789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that DSH3PX1 may link the Dscam receptor complex to cytoskeletal modification machinery.Here we describe the identification of the 145-kDa protein, which we have named Drosophila Ack. Mammalian ACKs are tyrosine kinases that are specifically activated by Cdc42 but not by Rac or Rho (6Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 7Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ACK1 is activated by the stimulation of M3-muscarinic receptors via a mechanism that requires the Src-like kinase, Fyn (8Linseman D.A. Heidenreich K.A. Fisher S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5622-5628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The association of ACK1 with Cdc42 may result in sustained activation of Cdc42 (6Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition, ACK1 has recently been shown to interact with Nck via its proline-rich regions and with clathrin via a clathrin-binding motif (9Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ACK2, a smaller splice variant of ACK1, is stimulated by bradykinin, epidermal growth factor, or integrin β1-mediated cell adhesion (10Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similar to ACK1, ACK2 activity is regulated by Src, and it also interacts with clathrin (11Yang W. Lo C.G. Dispenza T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17468-17473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Yang W. Lin Q. Zhao J. Guan J.-L. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43987-43993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, ACK-related tyrosine kinase-1, theCaenorhabditis elegans orthologue of ACK1, was shown to negatively regulate epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in a Grb-2-dependent manner (13Hopper N.A. Lee J. Sternberg P.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).This report describes the isolation, identification, and characterization of DAck. We demonstrate that DAck co-immunoprecipitates in a cellular complex with Dock and DSH3PX1 and confirm these observations with a systematic yeast two-hybrid analysis. The specific domains by which Dock directly interacts with DAck are identified in vitro by GST pull-down assays employing various GST-Dock fusion proteins. We also demonstrate that DSH3PX1 is a substrate for DAck in vivo and in vitro and determine that a major site of DSH3PX1 phosphorylation is a conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr-56) present in its SH3 domain. The phosphorylation of this tyrosine residue reduces the binding of DSH3PX1 with WASP, an interaction previously shown to require the DSH3PX1 SH3 domain (5Worby C. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J. Kruger R. Muda M. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41782-41789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Instead, tyrosine-phosphorylated DSH3PX1 interacts with Dock via its SH2 domain. This finding suggests that phosphorylation of DSH3PX1 by DAck changes its preference for protein interaction partners.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDock was first described by Garrity et al. (3Garrity P.A. Rao Y. Salecker I. McGlade J. Pawson T. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) as an adaptor protein playing a critical role in axonal pathfinding. Because tyrosine phosphorylation is known to play an important role in the development of the fly nervous system (16Desai C.J. Gindhart J.G. Goldstein L.S. Zinn K. Cell. 1996; 84: 599-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 17Krueger N.X. Van Vactor D. Wan H.I. Gelbart W.M. Goodman C.S. Saito H.

Nature. 1995; 376: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we were interested in the interactions directed by the SH2 domain of Dock. In an effort to identify tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that interact with Dock, the SH2 domain of Dock was overexpressed as a His-tagged protein inDrosophila S2 cells (4Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar,5Worby C. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J. Kruger R.

Protein lysates were prepared from S2 cells and subjected to Ni-agarose affinity chromatography followed by purification on a p-Tyr-specific antibody (4G10) affinity column. Proteins eluted from the anti-p-Tyr affinity column were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. A protein of 145 kDa was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin, and the peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography for sequence analysis.Sequence determination of the tryptic peptides obtained from p145 resulted in seven unambiguous amino acid sequences (Fig.1, underlined) that were used to search the Berkeley Drosophila genome data base for corresponding expressed sequence tags. Four overlapping expressed sequence tags, GH10884, GH07655, GH11561, and LD18821, in conjunction with 5′-RACE products were completely sequenced in order to obtain a full-length nucleotide sequence encoding p145. The cDNA contains an open reading frame of 3219 nucleotides encoding a tyrosine kinase (light gray box) with sequence similarity to mammalian kinases of the ACK family. Immediately following the kinase domain is an SH3 domain (dark gray box) followed by a COOH-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (black box) (Fig. 1). The UBA domain is a motif found in UV excision repair proteins, certain protein kinases, and proteins playing roles in the ubiquitination pathway (19Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Although the role of this domain is not known, it has been suggested that UBA domains are involved in conferring target specificity to enzymes of the ubiquitination system (19Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To date, there have been no reports of ACK ubiquitination, but we have observed that DAck is rapidly processed into smaller fragments in S2 cell extracts (data not shown).Between the SH3 domain and the UBA domain, the COOH-terminal sequence of DAck contains four proline-rich (PXXP) motifs (Fig. 1,clear boxes), which could be involved in interactions with SH3 domains. There are also six YXXϕ motifs (boldface) that are thought to be important in vesicle trafficking particularly with regard to interactions with the adaptor proteins in clathrin-coated vesicles (Fig. 1) (20Strous G.J. Govers R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a putative clathrin-binding core motif LIDIS is also found in this region of DAck (Fig. 1, gray box with white lettering). Mammalian ACK1 and ACK2 have recently been shown to interact directly with clathrin using this conserved motif (9Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Yang W. Lo C.G. Dispenza T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17468-17473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The most distinctive differences between mammalian ACKs and DAck are the apparent absence of a Cdc42-binding domain and the presence of a UBA domain in theDrosophila enzyme. The apparent absence of a Cdc42-binding domain in DAck raises the intriguing possibility that this enzyme may be activated by a different mechanism from mammalian ACKs.Because DAck and DSH3PX1 were purified from S2 cell extracts using the SH2 domain of Dock, we thought it was important to determine whether these molecules associate with one another in vivo. DSH3PX1 can be co-immunoprecipitated with both DAck and Dock from S2 cell extracts (Fig. 2 A) (5Worby C. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J. Kruger R. Muda M. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41782-41789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DAck can also be co-immunoprecipitated with Dock (Fig.2 B). Because DAck contains several proline-rich motifs, we wanted to know whether the SH3 domains of Dock and/or its SH2 domain interact with DAck. GST fusions of SH3 domains and SH2 domain of Dock were produced in bacteria and were used in a pull-down assay in conjunction with S2 cell extracts as the source of interacting proteins. Under these conditions, Dock interacts with DAck via its SH2 domain (Fig. 2 C). In the case of mammalian Nck and ACK1, it has been reported that the SH3 domains of Nck are able to bind to ACK1 in an overlay assay (9Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between our results and Teoet al. (9Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) most probably results from the type of assay employed. It is possible that DAck isolated from S2 cell extract is conformationally unavailable for binding to the SH3 domains of Dock. However, we also tested the ability of the DSH3PX1 SH3 domain to interact with DAck. As can be seen in Fig. 2 C, the SH3 domain of DSH3PX1 interacts strongly with DAck in S2 cell extracts, suggesting that at least one of the proline-rich (PXXP) motifs of DAck is available for protein-protein interactions.Figure 2In vivo and in vitroanalyses of the association of DAck with Dock and DSH3PX1. A, DAck and Dock associate with DSH3PX1 in S2 cells. Dock and DAck immunoprecipitates from S2 cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using DSH3PX1 antibodies. B, Dock immunoprecipitates with DAck from S2 cells. Dock and DAck immunoprecipitates from S2 cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with DAck antibodies. C, in vitroanalysis of the ability of Dock or DSH3PX1 GST fusions to interact with DAck. GST fusion proteins of the indicated Dock domains prepared in bacteria were mixed with extracts prepared from S2 cells. The ability of the GST fusion proteins to bind DAck was assessed by Western analysis using antibodies directed against DAck. The amount of Dock or DSH3PX1 GST fusion proteins present in each reaction is displayed in the Coomassie Blue-stained panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because DAck was isolated by virtue of its ability to interact with the Dock SH2 domain, we sought to dissect the potential protein-protein interactions between Dock complex proteins using a directed two-hybrid screen (5Worby C. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J. Kruger R. Muda M. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41782-41789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Dock interacts strongly with full-length DAck but not with a COOH-terminally truncated DAck construct consisting of amino acids 1–507 (TableI). It was not possible to use full-length DAck as a bait because of autoactivation. Because the DAck constructs encode the active kinase, the removal of the COOH-terminal sequence most probably removes an autophosphorylation site that is important for Dock SH2 domain binding (Fig. 2 C). Full-length DSH3PX1 as well as the DSH3PX1 SH3 domain also interact strongly with full-length DAck but not with truncated DAck, presumably because of the removal of one or more of the COOH-terminal PXXP motifs of DAck. As reported previously (4Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 5Worby C. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J. Kruger R. Muda M. Dixon J. J. Biol.

However, DAck (amino acids 1–507) that contains the kinase domain plus the SH3 domain is not capable of interacting with any of the Dock complex proteins tested. Therefore, the binding partners for the DAck SH3 domain are most probably not present in this group. Interestingly, our two-hybrid results suggest that Dock is able to interact with itself. This possibility would effectively increase the ability of Dock to bring together a variety of molecules simultaneously.Table IDAck protein interactionsLibrary →DockDAck (FL)DSH3PX1DscamVP16Bait ↓Dock1-aPartial overlap of data published in Worby et al.

Open table in a new tab Because DAck co-immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 A) and directly interacts (Table I) with DSH3PX1, we sought to determine whether DSH3PX1 is an in vivo substrate for this kinase. dsRNAs were used to ablate the expression of DAck and other intracellular Src-related tyrosine kinases and the resulting extracts separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis using antibodies directed against phosphotyrosine (Fig.3 A). Equal loading of DSH3PX1 was confirmed by stripping and reprobing the Western with antibody recognizing DSH3PX1 (Fig. 3 A). In S2 cell extracts, the ablation of DAck, Src42A, or Src64 each reduce the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated DSH3PX1. Simultaneous ablation of all three kinases completely obliterates Tyr phosphorylation of DSH3PX1. Alternatively, the removal of Shark and Abl did not effect the level of SH3PX1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that Src42A, Src64, and DAck are upstream of DSH3PX1 phosphorylation. Our ability to co-immunoprecipitate DSH3PX1 and DAck leads us to speculate that DAck is an important cellular kinase for DSH3PX1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, it has been reported that the Src-like kinase, Fyn, phosphorylates and activates mammalian ACK1 (8Linseman D.A. Heidenreich K.A. Fisher S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5622-5628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and that ACK2 activity is similarly controlled by Src phosphorylation (12Yang W. Lin Q. Zhao J. Guan J.-L. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43987-43993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduction in DSH3PX1 phosphorylation observed in the Src RNAi examples may be the result of reduced DAck activity. To demonstrate that DAck can directly phosphorylate DSH3PX1, DAck engineered to contain an NH2-terminal FLAG tag was stably expressed in S2 cells. This kinase was immunoprecipitated from S2 cells using FLAG beads followed by extensive washing in high salt buffer to remove any co-precipitating proteins. Precipitated DAck was then added to anin vitro kinase assay containing bacterially expressed DSH3PX1 as the substrate (Fig. 3 B). Under these experimental conditions, DAck is able to efficiently phosphorylate DSH3PX1. A kinase-dead version of DAck made by mutating Lys-156 to Ala, similarly expressed and immunoprecipitated from S2 cells, was not able to phosphorylate itself or DSH3PX1 (Fig. 3 B). This finding indicated that DAck and not a co-precipitating kinase was responsible for DAck phosphorylation. In addition, immunoprecipitated DAck only phosphorylates itself in the absence of added substrate, demonstrating that no potential substrates have co-immunoprecipitated with the active kinase under the experimental conditions used. Taken together, DSH3PX1 is an in vitro substrate for DAck, and our RNAi data suggest that it is also an in vivo substrate.Figure 3DAck, Src42A, and Src64 are cellular tyrosine kinases for DSH3PX1. A, profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated DSH3PX1 in S2 cell extracts treated with dsRNAs for various tyrosine kinases. Protein extracts from untreated S2 cells or S2 cells treated with the indicated dsRNAs directed against cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using p-Tyr antibodies and DSH3PX1 antibodies. The top panel represents the p-Tyr signal obtained for DSH3PX1, and the bottom panel represents the signal obtained for anti-DSH3PX1. B, in vitrokinase assay using immunoprecipitated DAck. NH2-terminal FLAG-tagged kinase-dead or wild type DAck was stably expressed in S2 cells. Wild type and mutant DAck were immunoprecipitated from S2 cells using FLAG beads and were combined with ∼5 μg of recombinant GST-DSH3PX1 in an in vitro kinase reaction (see “Materials and Methods”). Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue to verify equal loading. Phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography overnight at −80 °C with a screen. C, DAck in vitro kinase assay with DSH3PX1 mutants. Conserved Tyr residues in GST-DSH3PX1 were mutated to Phe, and the recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria. FLAG-tagged DAck was immunoprecipitated from S2 cells and mixed with recombinant DSH3PX1 in an in vitro kinase assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue to verify equal loading. Phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography overnight at −80 °C with a screen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To elucidate the role of DAck phosphorylation on DSH3PX1 function, the site of phosphorylation by DAck was determined. A comparison of the amino acid sequences among mammalian, C. elegans, andDrosophila SH3PX1 highlighted the conservation of several tyrosine residues including Tyr-9, Tyr-56, and Tyr-256 (Drosophila numbering) (5Worby C. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J. Kruger R. Muda M. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41782-41789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These Tyr residues were mutated to Phe in the context of the bacterial expression vector, GST-DSH3PX1. Mutant and wild type proteins were expressed in bacteria and subjected to the in vitro kinase assay as described above. FLAG-tagged wild type DAck was immunoprecipitated from S2 extracts as described under “Materials and Methods” and used in the in vitro kinase assays along with the bacterially expressed wild type and mutant DSH3PX1 proteins (Fig. 3 C). The mutation of Tyr-56 to Phe (Y56F) significantly reduced the ability of DAck to phosphorylate DSH3PX1, indicating that Tyr-56 is a major site of Tyr phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). Residual phosphorylation persists, suggesting that more than one Tyr in DSH3PX1 is phosphorylated by DAck. However, the mutation of Tyr-9 and Tyr-256 do not dramatically reduce the level of DSH3PX1 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that these residues are not candidates for DAck phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). It is interesting that Tyr-56 falls in the polyproline recognition site of the DSH3PX1 SH3 domain. Based on mutational studies on Src-family SH3 domains (21Liu X. Marengere L.E. Koch C.A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5225-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we predict that the phosphorylation of Tyr-56 would interfere with the ability of the DSH3PX1 SH3 domain to bind proline-rich ligands. Because we previously demonstrated that DSH3PX1 interacts with WASP via its SH3 domain, we predict that the phosphorylation of Tyr-56 will interfere with WASP binding. Similar results have been reported for the SH3 domain interactions of PSTPIP and Bruton's tyrosine kinase with WASP (22Morrogh L. Hinshelwood S. Costello P. Cory G. Kinnon C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2269-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Wu Y. Spencer S. Lasky L. J. Biol.

In the case of PSTPIP, the phosphorylation of Tyr-367, which resides in its SH3 domain polyproline-binding pocket interferes with WASP binding (22Morrogh L. Hinshelwood S. Costello P. Cory G. Kinnon C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2269-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For Bruton's tyrosine kinase, autophosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue in its SH3 domain abolishes its interaction with WASP while preserving its ability to interact with c-Cbl (23Wu Y. Spencer S. Lasky L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5765-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These reports provide evidence that a common theme may exist for regulating SH3 domain-polyproline interactions involving WASP.To test this theory, DSH3PX1 phosphorylated in vitro by DAck was allowed to interact with either Dock or WASP immobilized on affinity resins. After extensive washing, the amount of DSH3PX1 bound to each protein was visualized by Western analysis. In the case of Dock, His-tagged protein was produced in bacteria and attached to Ni-agarose resin. Because we could not produce recombinant WASP in bacteria, V5-tagged WASP was overexpressed and immunoprecipitated from S2 cells as described previously (5Worby C. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J. Kruger R. Muda M. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41782-41789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4 A, phosphorylated DSH3PX1 binds efficiently to epitope-tagged Dock, whereas nonphosphorylated-DSH3PX1 does not. This demonstrates that the phosphorylation of DSH3PX1 by DAck generates a binding site for the Dock SH2 domain. On the other hand, nonphosphorylated DSH3PX1 binds efficiently to WASP, whereas P-DSH3PX1 displays reduced binding (Fig.4 A). The interaction between P-DSH3PX1 and WASP can be explained by the incomplete phosphorylation of DSH3PX1 in our kinase assay and from the ability of nonphosphorylated DSH3PX1 to dimerize with P-DSH3PX1. Therefore, the above data suggest that the binding of DSH3PX1 to WASP may be regulated by phosphorylation of Tyr-56. To fu"

It is well established, however, that glucose induces internalization of Gal2p into the endocytotic pathway and its subsequent proteolysis in the vacuole, whereas FBPase is targeted to the 26 S proteasome for proteolysis under similar inactivation conditions. Here we report that two distinct proteolytic systems responsible for specific degradation of two conditionally short-lived protein targets, Gal2p and FBPase, utilize most (if not all) protein components of the same glucose sensing (signaling) pathway. Indeed, initiation of Gal2p and FBPase proteolysis appears to require rapid transport of those substrates of the Hxt transporters that are at least partially metabolized by hexokinase Hxk2p. Also, maltose transported via the maltose-specific transporter(s) generates an appropriate signal that culminates in the degradation of both proteins. In addition, Grr1p and Reg1p were found to play a role in transduction of the glucose signal for glucose-induced proteolysis of Gal2p and FBPase.

It is the aim of our work to shed some light on the question of how the nutrient glucose is able to induce two different degradation pathways, the ubiquitin proteasome-linked hydrolysis of FBPase1 and the lysosomal uptake and elimination of the membrane transporter Gal2p, in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Selective modification by ubiquitin serves as the primary signal, which confers instability on numerous naturally and/or conditionally short-lived proteins in eukaryotic cells. One well-established role for the covalent linkage of ubiquitin is to mark cytosolic and nuclear proteins as well as those proteins that are subjected to endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation to hydrolysis by the 26 S proteasome (1Bonifacino J.S.

For most of the 26 S proteasome protein targets, the attachment of a polyubiquitin chain composed of at least four ubiquitin monomer units linked by isopeptide bonds between Lys48 of ubiquitin molecules and the C-terminal carboxyl group of the following ubiquitin facilitates their binding to the proteasome (8Chau V.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). However, ubiquitination of many short-lived cell surface nutrient transporters, ion channels, and signal-transducing receptors appears to play no role in proteasomal proteolysis and signals their internalization into the endocytotic pathway followed by subsequent proteolysis in the vacuole instead (1Bonifacino J.S.

In all known cases of yeast plasma membrane proteins, a single ubiquitin moiety or di-ubiquitin chains in which ubiquitin molecules are linked through Lys63 appear to suffice to trigger their endocytotic uptake and degradation in the vacuole. Most of the short-lived plasma membrane proteins are constitutively internalized into the endocytotic system. The rate of their internalization can be increased by a change in a variety of parameters such as nutrient availability, binding of substrates or other ligands, or stress (13Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 41-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).

FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), represent a group of proteins that are significantly degraded in the presence of an easily fermentable carbon source such as glucose. Their degradation occurs by a mechanism called glucose- or catabolite-induced inactivation due to apparent analogy with the catabolic inactivation of gluconeogenic enzymes (20Holzer H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 1: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Holzer H. Cell Biol. Rev. 1989; 21: 305-319Google Scholar). Glucose-induced inactivation is a process that occurs upon arrest of cytosolic protein synthesis by either nitrogen source depletion or the addition of cycloheximide to the growth medium in combination with glucose (in the case of transporters) or simply by the addition of glucose (in the case of gluconeogenic enzymes). Although inactivation conditions and the ultimate fate of the proteins are similar, the gluconeogenic enzymes and the above-mentioned sugar transporters are hydrolyzed by two distinct proteolytic systems: gluconeogenic enzymes are degraded by the 26 S proteasome, whereas transporters are degraded by the vacuolar proteases. To identify the mechanism(s) that determines the different fates of proteins observed during their inactivation, we wanted to elucidate whether these differences could be due to utilization of distinct glucose sensing/signaling pathways by different proteolytic systems. Two proteolytic target proteins undergoing glucose-induced degradation, FBPase as a substrate of the 26 S proteasome and galactose transporter Gal2p as a substrate of vacuolar proteases, were chosen. Our previous studies (17Horak J. Wolf D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1541-1549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Horak J. Wolf D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3083-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) had revealed that in response to glucose addition to galactose-grown cells, Gal2p is monoubiquitinated at several lysine residues. This is triggered through the Ubc1p-Ubc4p-Ubc5p triad of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and the ubiquitin-protein ligase Npi1p/Rsp5p before transfer of Gal2p to the vacuole, the site of its degradation. In contrast, upon glucose addition to cells growing on a nonfermentable carbon source, polyubiquitination of FBPase occurs. This is also induced by the Ubc1p-Ubc4p-Ubc5p triad of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and, in addition, requires Ubc8p. This modification appears to be essential for its proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome (22Hämmerle M. Bauer J. Rose M. Szallies A. Thumm M. Dusterhus S. Mecke D. Entian K.-D. Wolf D.H. J. Biol.

There is evidence that some protein components of these pathways, Rgt2p, Rgt1p, Grr1p, Reg1p, and Hxk2p, are involved in posttranslational proteolysis of the maltose-specific Mal61p transporter (34Jiang H.

We started our analysis with a search for the potential functions of the main protein components of glucose sensing systems in the Gal2p and FBPase proteolysis. TheS. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in TableI. For assays of Gal2p turnover, the yeast cell cultures were grown in either rich medium (1% yeast extract and 2% Bacto peptone) or minimal SD medium (0.67% Difco nitrogen base without amino acids), supplemented with 2% d-galactose plus 0.02% glucose and auxotrophic requirements. The cells were grown at 30 °C on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) to anA 600 of 0.5–1.0. To induce the Gal2p inactivation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (2500 ×g, 4 min), washed with water, and resuspended in 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium and amino acids plus 2% glucose or any other “inactivating” sugar as indicated to anA 600 of 3. In wild type cells, the effect of 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 6-deoxy-d-glucose, and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose on catabolite degradation of Gal2p was also tested in the presence of 2%d-galactose. Similarly, the influence of glucose on the fate of Gal2p in the Δhxk1Δhxk2Δglk1 triple mutant was tested in the presence of 2% d-galactose. The cell samples were taken at the times indicated below over a 6-h period, and for each sample, total cell extracts were prepared for Western analysis as described previously (18Horak J. Wolf D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3083-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For assays of FBPase turnover, the overnight cell cultures grown on rich medium in the presence of 2%d-glucose were diluted 1:100 in the same medium and grown for additional 6–7 h. Then the cells were washed, resuspended in rich medium containing 2% ethanol to an A 600 of 0.5, and grown for an additional 16–17 h to de-repress FBPase (finalA 600 = 4–5). To induce FBPase inactivation,d-glucose was added to 2% concentration to the cell suspension at an A 600 of 3, and cell samples were taken at the times indicated below over 1–2 h. For each sample, total cell extracts were prepared for Western analysis. When other sugars were used for FBPase inactivation, pulse-chase analysis was done (see below).Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeOriginCEN.PK2–1CMATa leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ1 MAL2–8CE.

After harvesting and washing with water, the cells were preincubated in CM-Met medium containing 2% ethanol for 2.5 h at an A 600 of 5. Radiolabeling was done by adding [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to the suspension to a final concentration of 45 μCi/ml. After 3.5 h at 30 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in complete medium containing 10 mml-methionine and 2% glucose or another “inactivating” sugar. 1-ml samples were taken at the times indicated, and trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 5%) was added. The precipitates were washed with 100 μl of acetone and lysed in 100 μl of breaking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 murea, 1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA) with glass beads three times for 5 min with intermittent heating for 1 min at 100 °C. After cooling, the lysate was diluted with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 190 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, and 1.25% Triton X-100) containing complete protease inhibitor mix and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged, and the supernatants were transferred to new test tubes. FBPase antiserum (3 μl) was added, and the samples were gently agitated for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitates were collected by adding a protein A-Sepharose CL-4B suspension (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.; 5% (w/v) in immunoprecipitation buffer) and further incubated for 1 h. The Sepharose beads were centrifuged (2 min, 3000 rpm) and washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. Proteins were released from Sepharose by boiling in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (200 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) for 10 min at 100 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and protein bands were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Western blot analysis of FBPase was carried out as described previously for the Gal2p transporter (20Holzer H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 1: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (158) Google Scholar), with one exception; the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were solubilized for 40 min at 37 °C and then solubilized for another 3–4 min at 95 °C. The Gal2p protein and FBPase in the extracts were detected using anti-Gal2p (1:2000) and anti-FBPase (1:5000) specific antibodies and the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Antibodies to Gal2p were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1–20. The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for immunization of rabbits (Eurogentec). The relative intensities of the Gal2p and FBPase bands at each time point were quantified by scanning densitometry on ECL-Hyperfilms. The addition of rapidly fermentable sugars such as glucose to glucose-depleted cells or cells grown on nonfermentable carbon sources causes a rapid, transient peak in intracellular cAMP concentration. This cAMP signal triggers a cAMP-protein kinase A-mediated protein phosphorylation cascade that affects numerous targets at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels (29Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 304-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 32Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol.

Rolland F. Teunissen A. Van Dijck P. Versele M. Wera S. Winderickx J. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 26: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Components of this cAMP pathway in yeast include the heterotrimeric G protein Gpa2p and, upstream of Gpa2p, the G protein-coupled receptor Gpr1p, which stimulate cAMP synthesis by adenylate cyclase Cyr1p in response to glucose and other easily fermentable carbon sources (37Colombo S. Ma P. Cauwenberg L. Winderickx J. Crauwels M. Teunissen A. Nauwelaers D. de Winde J.H. Gorwa M.-F. Colavizza D. Thevelein J.M.

Activation of cAMP production is also dependent on glucose transport via Hxt transporters and hexokinase-mediated intracellular phosphorylation of this sugar, suggesting that glucose is sensed extracellularly by Gpr1p and intracellularly by hexokinases (29Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 304-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Besides Gpa2p, the G proteins Ras1p and Ras2p regulate basal activity of adenylate cyclase; however, the role of Ras signaling in signal transmission, if any, is unclear at present. The fact that the conditions used to trigger proteolysis of the Gal2p transporter and FBPase also cause an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration prompted us to examine the fate of these proteins ingpr1 and gpa2 deletion mutants in response to glucose. Our data indicate that the rates of Gal2p (Fig.1 A) and FBPase (Fig.1 B) degradation are not altered in the mutant strains as compared with the wild type. Analogous results were obtained when the fates of Gal2p and FBPase were measured in a strain carrying a deletedRAM1 gene encoding the β-subunit of protein farnesyltransferase, which modifies the Ras protein (data not shown). Because in addition to its regulatory functions, glucose is a nutrient, its presence can be detected by the cells in several ways: (i) by glucose-specific receptors, (ii) by its metabolite(s), or (iii) by the metabolic changes it causes. To decide among these alternatives, we analyzed the fate of Gal2p and FBPase by measuring their turnover rates in yeast strains carrying deletions in two genes, SNF3 and RGT2, encoding putative glucose sensors/receptors using standard inactivation assays. The Snf3p and Rgt2p proteins are unique members of the hexose transporter (Hxt) family comprising about 20 proteins related in sequence (40Boles E. Hollenberg C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 85-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kruckeberg A.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 166: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 42Wieczorke R. Krampe S. Weierstall T. Freidel K. Hollenberg C.P. Boles E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). These two proteins differ from the other Hxt family members in that they are poorly expressed, control rather than mediate glucose transport, and possess unique, extremely long, presumably cytoplasmic C-terminal tails. They are thought to play a role in glucose sensing at low (Snf3p) and high (Rgt2p) extracellular glucose concentrations (31Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1996; 63: 554-569Crossref Google Scholar,43Liang H. Gaber R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1953-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 44Özcan S. Dover J. Rosenwald A. Wolfl S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2566-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis monitoring the fate of Gal2p and FBPase indicated a half-life of about 1 h for Gal2p (Fig.2 A) and about 20 min for FBPase (Fig. 2 B) in wild type as well as snf3 andrgt2 mutant cells. Thus, the rate of proteolysis of both proteins in response to glucose is not altered in snf3 andrgt2 deletion mutants, indicating that none of the glucose receptors examined is involved in the signaling pathway for degradation of Gal2p and FBPase. Recent work has discovered two additional proteins, Mth1p/Htr1p and Std1p/Msn3p, that may also be components of the glucose induction mechanism, which regulates HXT gene expression (46Lafuente M.J. Gancedo C. Jauniaux J.-C. Gancedo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 47Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. Zhang X. Tillman T.S. Solimeo H. Wölfl S. Almonte C.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both proteins interact with the C-terminal tails of the glucose sensors Snf3p and Rgt2p and are presumably involved in the transmission of glucose signals in the upper part of the glucose sensing/signaling pathway(s). Although our results suggest that a glucose signaling pathway independent of the glucose sensors Snf3p and Rgt2p is involved in the proteolysis of Gal2p and FBPase, they do not exclude the requirement of Std1p and Mth1p in this process a priori. Therefore, we compared the fates of Gal2p and FBPase in wild type strains with those in std1 and mth1 deletion mutants. The rates of the Gal2p and FBPase degradation are not significantly affected in std1 and mth1 mutants as compared with the wild type strain (data not shown). Because metabolism-independent glucose receptors/sensors Snf3p and Rgt2p are not involved in the detection of extracellular glucose, other obvious candidates for such a function are the general hexose transporters (Hxt) and glucokinases, which mediate the uptake and subsequent phosphorylation of intracellular glucose and related sugars. To decide between glucose itself and its metabolite(s) as the primary signal for Gal2p and FBPase degradation, we first compared the fate of both of these proteins in response to glucose, glucose analogues, and related sugars known or supposed to be the substrates of Hxt transporters. The selected sugars include the nonmetabolizable 6-deoxy-d-glucose andd-fucose, as well as 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose, which can be phosphorylated but not metabolized further. Other sugars tested are the rapidly fermented d-fructose and d-mannose, which are metabolized like d-glucose but with somewhat lower efficacy. To unravel whether the signal needed for triggering of Gal2p and FBPase proteolysis is specific for the substrates of Hxt transporters or not, the capability of the sugarsd-galactose, d-maltose, raffinose, and sucrose, which are substrates of other transporters and/or other metabolic pathways, was examined. Our results are shown in Fig.3 and are summed up as follows. (i) Gal2p is not degraded when the nonmetabolizable sugars 6-deoxy-d-glucose and d-fucose, a gratuitous inducer of Gal2p, 2J. Horak, J. Regelmann, and D. H. Wolf, unpublished data. are present. However, the presence of 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose is sufficient for a relatively rapid degradation of Gal2p (Fig. 3 A). Because degradation of Gal2p is tested under starvation conditions devoid of a carbon source, the effects of nonmetabolizable sugars on Gal2p degradation could be due to the lack of ATP production. The ability of 2-deoxy-d-glucose to deplete intracellular ATP pools has been described previously (49Beullens M. Thevelein J.M. Curr. Microbiol. 1990; 21: 39-46Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the fate of Gal2p in the presence of 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 3-O-methyl-d-glucose, and 6-deoxy-d-glucose and also in the presence of the easily usable carbon and energy source d-galactose. No differences in the inactivation patterns were observed (data not shown), indicating that changes in the ATP content, if any, are not responsible for the effects observed. (ii) The easily fermentable sugarsd-fructose and d-mannose appear to be comparably as efficient as glucose in triggering the proteolysis of Gal2p (Fig. 3 A). This is in contrast to the Mal61p transporter, whose proteolysis is not significantly induced byd-fructose or d-mannose (36Jiang H. Tatchell K. Liu S. Michels C.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). (iii) Selected di- and trisaccharides that are split into their monosaccharide moieties either in the extracellular space (sucrose in most yeast strains, or raffinose) or after uptake by specific transporters are hydrolyzed intracellularly (such as maltose, for instance) serve as “inactivating” sugars to a different extent. Maltose triggers degradation of Gal2p in galactose-grown wild type cells carrying a constitutive MAL2-8C allele that causes highMAL gene expression even in the absence of maltose (CEN.PK2-1C strain), but not in the wild type W303-1A strain (mal background) This suggests that transport of maltose has to occur for initiation of Gal2p degradation (Fig. 3 A). (iv) Galactose itself does not lead to significant proteolysis of the Gal2p transporter. Taken together, our results show that the generation of an intracellular metabolic signal that initiates proteolysis of the Gal2p transporter requires transport and at least phosphorylation of the proper sugar. The signal is not specific for glucose, neither its transport through Hxt transporters nor its metabolism. The rapid glucose-triggered inactivation of FBPase does not occur under the same inactivation conditions used for the Gal2p transporter, whose proteolysis is strongly accelerated by nitrogen starvation (see here) or by the addition of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of cytosolic protein synthesis (17Horak J. Wolf D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1541-1549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of cycloheximide or nitrogen starvation prevents glucose-triggered degradation of FBPase, probably due to the absence of an “inactivation factor” whose glucose-induced synthesis is ne"

This work represents the first unequivocal identification of the polypeptide synthesis in kinetoplasts. The kinetoplast-mitochondrial genetic system of trypanosomes has revealed features that clearly distinguish it from animal, fungal, or plant mitochondria. The maxicircle component of kinetoplast DNA networks contains cryptic genes whose expression depends on post-transcriptional mRNA editing by uridylate insertions and deletions (1Estevez A.M. Simpson L. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 240: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Bioenerg.

This process is mediated by guide RNAs encoded in the kinetoplast DNA minicircles, which account for the bulk of DNA in these mitochondria. After the discoveries of RNA editing in 1986 (4Benne R. Van den Burg J. Brakenhoff J. Sloof P. Van Boom J. Tromp M. Cell. 1986; 46: 819-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) and guide RNAs in 1990 (5Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), there has been a steady progress toward elucidating the mechanism of this process, which has now been demonstrated to involve several enzymes and protein factors (6Aphasizhev R.

At the same time very little is known about other aspects of kinetoplast gene expression, especially at the level of translation. The very existence of a functional translation system remained unproven for almost 3 decades (summarized in Ref. 11Breek C.K. Speijer D. Dekker H. Muijsers A.O. Benne R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1997; 378: 837-841Google Scholar). This question is important because kinetoplast translation must utilize templates modified or created by editing, and it is interesting to investigate interactions of these two systems. Early works demonstrated that cycloheximide at low concentrations effectively inhibited cytosolic translation in Crithidia luciliae and Trypanosoma brucei in vivo. A small fraction of the total cell protein synthesis was resistant to cycloheximide and at the same time insensitive to d-chloramphenicol and other inhibitors at concentrations that inhibit mitochondrial translation in other organisms (12Kleisen C.M. Borst P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 390: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Spithill T. Shimer S. Hill G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1981; 2: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, high concentrations (∼1 mg/ml) of chloramphenicol substantially inhibited total cell protein synthesis inT. brucei (13Spithill T. Shimer S. Hill G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1981; 2: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas in C. luciliae the inhibition was close to 50% (14Laub-Kuperszteijn R. Thirion J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 340: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, no inhibition was observed in a closely related organism, Crithidia fasciculata (15Dixon H. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 450Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that some permeability barriers might be responsible for the apparent lack of chloramphenicol-sensitive translation in whole cells, the analysis of translation in the isolated mitochondrial fractions of T. brucei and Crithidia oncopelti showed that protein synthesis is indeed sensitive to lower concentrations of mitochondrial inhibitors (13Spithill T. Shimer S. Hill G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1981; 2: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Zaitseva G.N. Kolesnikov A.A. Shirshov A.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1977; 14: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A recent analysis of amino acid incorporation by digitonin-treated cells or the isolated kinetoplast-mitochondria ofT. brucei (17Nabholz C.E. Speijer D. Schneider A. Parasitol. Res. 1999; 85: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Shu H.H. Göringer H.U. Parasitology. 1998; 116: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) apparently confirmed the existence of chloramphenicol-sensitive and cycloheximide-resistant kinetoplast translation system. In contrast, this idea was not supported by the results obtained in C. fasciculata, which showed that leucine incorporation by digitonin-treated kinetoplast-mitochondria was insensitive to 250 μg/ml chloramphenicol (19Hill R.C. Morris C.A. Weber M.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 170: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The insensitivity to a broad range of chloramphenicol concentration in this organism was recently shown again, although no attempts to increase the permeabilization were made (20Tittawella I.

Although incomplete inhibition in principle can be caused by impermeable barriers, the observed discrepancies can also be attributed to the presence of variable levels of bacterial contamination in kinetoplast preparations, as well as the presence of prokaryotic endosymbionts in some species. Because of this controversy, a differential sensitivity of polypeptide synthesis to antibiotics, which in other systems served as a reliable criterion to distinguish cytosolic translation from mitochondrial, cannot be used as an evidence for translation in kinetoplasts. The problem can be solved, however, by demonstrating the de novosynthesis of individual polypeptides with known kinetoplast origin. We have recently identified two such polypeptides, cytochrome coxidase subunit I (COI) 1COcytochromec oxidaseTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineBNBlue NativeNDNADH dehydrogenaseCybapocytochrome bSoTETris-HCl, sorbitol, EDTA and apocytochrome b (Cyb), which were found in enzymatically active respiratory complexes IV and III, respectively, fromLeishmania tarentolae (21Horváth A.

The N-terminal sequences of these polypeptides matched the sequences of the corresponding mRNAs, which in the case of Cyb is modified by RNA editing, indicating that they are translated in the kinetoplasts. In this work we have identified the de novo synthesized COI, COII, and Cyb polypeptides in isolated kinetoplasts and demonstrated that they assemble into the corresponding respiratory complexes. This work for the first time clearly demonstrates the existence of protein synthesis in kinetoplasts and describes some unusual properties of this process. cytochromec oxidase N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine Blue Native NADH dehydrogenase apocytochrome b Tris-HCl, sorbitol, EDTA Cells of L. tarentolae, strain UC, were cultivated in brain heart infusion medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml hemin and grown to a density 0.8–1.2 × 108 cells/ml as described earlier (24Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The kinetoplast-mitochondrial fraction was isolated after cell rupture by nitrogen cavitation according to the procedure described previously with some modifications (25Hauser R. Pypaert M. Hausler T. Horn E.K. Schneider A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure was performed at 0–4 °C. Cells obtained from a 6-liter culture were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min and washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.9, containing 20 mm glucose and 150 mm NaCl. Washed cell were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 mmsorbitol, 2 mm EDTA (SoTE buffer) at 4 × 109 cells/ml in a beaker. The suspension was placed inside a Parr 4635 cell disruption chamber and compressed nitrogen was applied at the 65 bar pressure for 60 min. Following the quick release of gas pressure, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in the original volume of SoTE and MgCl2 was adjusted to 6 mm. DNase I was added to 50 μg/ml, and the suspension was sheared by forcing through a 26-gauge needle and incubated for 30 min. EDTA was added to 6 mm. The unbroken cells and other large debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended and centrifugation repeated. Kinetoplasts were recovered from the combined supernatants by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 60% Percoll made with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, and the suspension was layered underneath six 20–35% Percoll gradients. The gradients were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckman SW 28 rotor. The kinetoplast band formed in the lower part of the gradient. The organelles were retrieved from the gradients and diluted with excess SoTE buffer. Percoll was removed by two rounds of centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The final pellet was resuspended in SoTE at a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml, and kinetoplasts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The analysis was done using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature using the fluorescent dye 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5)) (Molecular Probes) at 622-nm excitation wavelength, 670-nm emission wavelength, and 0.5-s response time in 2-ml samples as described previously (25Hauser R. Pypaert M. Hausler T. Horn E.K. Schneider A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dye uptake was measured using 10–20 μl of the kinetoplast suspension (200–400 μg of protein). The dye release resulting from membrane depolarization was monitored after addition of valinomycin to a final concentration of 2.5 μm. Cells (106) were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with SoTE, resuspended in 100 μl of this buffer, and incubated with 100 μCi of EasyTag™ EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, >1000 Ci/mmol) at 28 °C for 60 min. Prior to the electrophoresis, labeled cells were extracted with 0.05% Triton X-100 diluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. For translation in cell lysates, we used the preparations obtained during the isotonic isolation of kinetoplasts (described above) directly after cell breakage by cavitation. Conditions of the labeling reaction for lysates were similar to the conditions for whole cells. A translation mixture was prepared similar to the method described by Nabholz et al. (17Nabholz C.E. Speijer D. Schneider A. Parasitol. Res. 1999; 85: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and contained 600 mm sorbitol, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm KH2PO4, 20 mmMgSO4, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 5 mmNADH, 5 mm succinate, 12 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.1 mm amounts of each amino acid except methionine and cysteine. The reaction was set according to Refs. 17Nabholz C.E. Speijer D. Schneider A. Parasitol. Res. 1999; 85: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar and 26Poyton R.O. Bellus G. McKee E.E. Sevarino K. Goehring B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 36-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar with the following modifications. Kinetoplasts (100–200 μg of protein) were briefly pelleted in a bench-top centrifuge, resuspended in 10 μl of SoTE, and combined with 100 μl of 1.2-fold concentrated translation buffer. After addition of creatine phosphokinase (Sigma) to 0.18 mg/ml and an appropriate antibiotic solution (see below), kinetoplasts were pre-incubated at 28 °C in 14-ml Falcon capped plastic tubes for 10 min with agitation at 100 rpm followed by the addition of 100 μCi (∼8–9 μl) of EasyTag™ EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix or l-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, >1000 Ci/mmol). Most reactions included cycloheximide at 50 μg/ml added at the preincubation step. Incubation continued for the specified periods of time followed by chilling on ice, and kinetoplasts were recovered by a 5-min centrifugation at 2,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of SoTE containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged again. This was followed by resuspension of the pellet in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.05% Triton X-100, incubation on ice for 30 min, and centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 20 min. Before loading on the electrophoretic gel, the last pellet, resuspended in 50 μl of the Triton buffer, was mixed with an equal volume of denaturing buffer containing 125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Stock solutions of the antibiotics were prepared at 50 mg/ml in water (emetine, gentamycin, hygromycin, lincomycin, paromomycin, puromycin, tetracycline) or methanol (chloramphenicol, cycloheximide). Antibiotics were purchased from Fluka and Sigma. This was done using the strain S. cerevisiaeS288C according to published methods (26Poyton R.O. Bellus G. McKee E.E. Sevarino K. Goehring B.

After a 30-min incubation at 0 °C, the insoluble material was recovered by a 20-min centrifugation at 16,000 × g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The samples were analyzed by single dimension Tris-glycine-SDS gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), two-dimensional Tris-glycine-SDS gels (29Marres C.A.M. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 462: 531-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and BN/Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels (BN gels) (30Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) as described previously (23Horváth A. Kingan T.G. Maslov D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed for 40 min in 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol and stained with Coomassie Blue R250 (Sigma). For autoradiography, stained gels were subjected to four 10-min washes in water followed by 40-min incubation in 1 msalicylate solution and dried with vacuum. Western blot analysis was performed after semidry electroblotting. The source of anti-COI serum and its immunoaffinity purification were described previously (23Horváth A. Kingan T.G. Maslov D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The blots were treated with SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). The procedures utilized for N-terminal amino acid sequencing have also been described earlier (23Horváth A. Kingan T.G. Maslov D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because quality of the kinetoplasts was crucial for efficient in organellotranslation, we compared several isolation procedures. We used the level of electrochemical transmembrane potential in freshly isolated organelles and its maintenance after freezing-thawing as the criteria for intact kinetoplasts. Isolation by the traditional method of hypotonic cell lysis followed by purification in Renografin gradients (24Braly P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) yielded organelles lacking a potential (data not shown). When kinetoplast were isolated isotonically by nitrogen cavitation (25Hauser R. Pypaert M. Hausler T. Horn E.K. Schneider A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by Renografin gradient centrifugation, a measurable potential was present (data not shown); however, it was almost completely lost after one round of freezing-thawing. The use of Percoll gradients resulted in organelles with a higher potential (Fig.1 A), which was stably maintained after incubation of the organelles on ice for at least 3 h. A measurable fraction of the potential was observed after one cycle of freezing-thawing (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained after purification of kinetoplasts in Nycodenz gradients (25Hauser R. Pypaert M. Hausler T. Horn E.K. Schneider A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, contamination of the kinetoplasts with unbroken cells and cell debris, as seen in light microscope, was significantly higher, whereas the yield was lower. The Percoll procedure was adopted for the subsequent work. It should also be mentioned that the highest potential was observed in kinetoplasts purified by several rounds of low speed differential centrifugation instead of gradients (data not shown). The potential was well maintained after freezing-thawing; however, contamination levels in such preparations were unacceptably high. After intact cells were incubated in SoTE buffer in the presence of radioactive methionine and cysteine, they were lysed and the labeled polypeptides were resolved by electrophoresis in denaturing gels. A specific pattern of bands representing the de novo synthesized polypeptides was observed (Fig. 2, lane 1). A nearly identical pattern was seen when the protein synthesis was performed using cell lysates (Fig. 2, lane 2). Cycloheximide and emetine at 50 μg/ml significantly inhibited isotope incorporation. After an exposure time equivalent to that shown in Fig.2 (lanes 1 and 2), no bands were detected on the autoradiogram (data not shown). The observed labeling, therefore, was attributed to cytosolic translation, and the corresponding pattern of labeled bands is hereafter referred to as the whole cell or cytosolic pattern. Although the inhibition by cycloheximide was very efficient, it was not complete, and a longer exposure revealed a residual, cycloheximide-resistant incorporation pattern (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). This pattern of bands could be traced to a specific subset of minor bands seen in the whole cell pattern. The “residual” pattern accounts for no more than 4% of the total incorporation as judged by the PhosphorImager analysis of a gel similar to that presented in Fig. 2. Cycloheximide at 1 mg/ml only slightly reduced the incorporation to a level of ∼2.5%. The residual translation was also resistant to chloramphenicol at high concentrations (data not shown). Although it could be expected that the cycloheximide-resistant pattern represented kinetoplast translation, further analysis indicated that this was not the case. In the original experiments we used the complete translation mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the course of this work, we found that, surprisingly, the presence of the remaining amino acids and the ATP regeneration system did not stimulate protein synthesis, and that this process can occur in SoTE buffer alone. This property is further addressed in the next section. When isotonically isolated, gradient-purified organelles were incubated in SoTE buffer with 35S-labeled amino acids without or with cycloheximide, the observed incorporation pattern largely resembled translation in unfractionated lysates or residual translation, respectively (data not shown). The presence of contaminating cytoplasmic membranes was not unexpected because a relatively low, ∼3-fold, enrichment of kinetoplasts is achieved by this method (31Allemann N. Schneider A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); however, it had become clear that the residual incorporation could obscure kinetoplast translation. An additional complication was caused by the hydrophobic nature of kinetoplast-encoded polypeptides, such as COI and Cyb. We observed earlier that each of these molecules formed a series of aggregation products that were seen in single dimension SDS gels as broad, diffuse bands (22Horváth A. Berry E.A. Maslov D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1639-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Horváth A. Kingan T.G. Maslov D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). If these properties are shared by other kinetoplast-encoded polypeptides, which are also predicted to be hydrophobic, then an overlapping set of bands from the translation products will be represented by a smear. These factors made single dimension gel electrophoresis unsuitable for the analysis of kinetoplast translation. We, therefore, had to look for an alternative procedure, which would allow us to separate the kinetoplast pattern and identify its individual components. We have previously shown that COI and Cyb polypeptides migrate in the form of well separated spots positioned off the main diagonal in 9versus 14% two-dimensional polyacrylamide-SDS gels. Now, when we applied this gel system to the analysis of the products generated by in organello labeling in the presence of cycloheximide, we observed a labeled diagonal and a series of off-diagonal spots (Fig. 3 A). By correlating the positions of these spots with the known positions of COI and Cyb spots, identified in the Coomassie-stained gel (Fig.3 A, inset image), we could easily identify the observed de novo synthesis products representing these polypeptides. We observed both the monomeric form of COI (spotc) and its aggregated forms (spots b anda and other high molecular weight spots) that we have identified previously (23Horváth A. Kingan T.G. Maslov D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The monomeric form of Cyb was also present in its characteristic gel position (22Horváth A. Berry E.A. Maslov D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1639-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although its labeling was significantly lower level than that of COI. This difference contrasts sharply with the nearly equal ratio of the corresponding Coomassie-stained bands (Fig. 3 A, inset). Although intensity varied in different experiments, the labeling of the COI spots was always higher than Cyb. In the COI molecule there are twice as many predicted methionine residues (28 residues) as in Cyb (12 residues), whereas the cysteine content is nearly equal (19 and 20 residues, respectively). The labeling pattern in Fig. 3 A was produced using E. coli 35S-labeled hydrolysate in which [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine accounted for 73 and 22% of the radioactivity, respectively. The intensity of COI was also greater than Cyb when labeling was done using methionine alone (Fig. 3 B). Although the methionine content certainly contributes to the observed labeling difference, it is not a sufficient explanation. Therefore, other factors must be responsible. It is noticeable that the COI aggregates (spots b,a, and others) were labeled less intensively with [35S]Met than with the labeled mixture. This result is consistent with our previous observation that the spot blikely includes a heterodimer of COI and COIII. The COIII polypeptide contains 24 Cys residues and 5 Met residues. The influence of the components included in translation mixtures, such as amino acids and an ATP regeneration system, was investigated by the experiments presented in Fig. 4. Comparison of the labeling intensity in a complete system (Fig.4 A) to incubation in SoTE alone (Fig. 4 D) showed that there was no stimulation of [35S]Met and Cys incorporation by these additional components. Gel resolution, however, declined when a complete medium was used. Addition of the remaining 18 amino acids at 0.1 mm concentrations to the SoTE buffer medium slightly reduced the incorporation (Fig. 4 C), whereas their omission from the complete medium slightly increased it (Fig.4 B). These results indicate that the reaction utilizes the endogenous pool of amino acids, whereas the exogenously added components may slightly compete with the uptake of the isotope. The observed situation contrasted sharply with translation in the isolated yeast mitochondria, in which no incorporation was observed in SoTE with or without amino acids in a one h incubation (Fig.4 E). Translation medium without the 18 amino acids produced a smeared pattern that is probably the result of incomplete synthesis of polypeptides, which were hence misfolded and aggregated. On the other hand, very efficient polypeptide synthesis was observed after the reintroduction of the missing components. The overall efficiency of yeast mitochondrial synthesis, as judged by the comparison of band intensities, was at least an order of magnitude greater than in kinetoplasts. The observed synthesis of kinetoplast Cyb and COI was not affected by chloramphenicol, hygromycin, paromomycin, lincomycin, tetracycline, and gentamycin at 100 μg/ml (Fig.5 A). Interestingly, puromycin strongly inhibited synthesis of Cyb, and synthesis of COI was also noticeably affected. Yeast translation, as expected, was completely inhibited by chloramphenicol and puromycin and was noticeably sensitive to other antibiotics (Fig. 5 B). A number of labeled polypeptides are always found in the main diagonal of the kinetoplast two-dimensional gels. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of these proteins correspond to unidentified kinetoplast-encoded translation products. However, taking into account the existence of cycloheximide-resistant residual translation, it is more likely that the diagonal represents translation products from contaminating cytoplasmic ribosomes. Contaminating cytosolic rRNA was detectable in the RNA extracted from the kinetoplast preparations used in these experiments, although it was much less abundant than the kinetoplast 12 and 9 S rRNAs (data not shown). The intensity of the diagonal generally correlated with the level of contamination by unbroken cells and cell debris, as judged by light microscopy. The reasons why a fraction of cytoplasmic ribosomes was insensitive to cycloheximide remain unclear. Freshly isolated kinetopla"

To determine whether ERβ was capable of altering DNA conformation and whether ERα- and ERβ-induced transcription activation might be related to the abilities of these two receptors to induce conformational changes in DNA structure, we have compared the abilities of ERα and ERβ to activate transcription and induce flexibility and directed bending in ERE-containing DNA fragments and determined the effects of DNA bending on transcription activation. Transient cotransfections carried out with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells utilized 3 μg of the CAT reporter plasmid, ERE TATA-CAT (41Nardulli A.M. Romine L.E. Carpo C. Greene G.L. Rainish B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 694-704PubMed Google Scholar), which contains an ERE in theBglII site of ATC0, 200 ng of the β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and 5 ng of the human ERα expression vector pCMV5 hER (42Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6595-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or the human ERβ expression vector pCMV5 hERβ (43McInerney E.M. Weis K.E. Sun J. Mosselman S. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Transient transfections carried out in U2 osteosarcoma (U2-OS) cells utilized 25 ng of ERα or ERβ expression vector and 3 μg of a CAT reporter plasmid containing an ERE in the SalI site of ATC0 (ATC1, Ref. 44Chang T.-C. Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Shapiro D.J. Mol.

Grobner C. Cotter D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1064-1076PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (25Loven M.A. Likhite V.S. Choi I. Nardulli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45282-45288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CAT activity was quantitated as described (24Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). β-galactosidase activity was determined (45Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and used to normalize for transfection efficiency. To construct the CDβ expression vector, nucleotides encoding amino acids 134–260 of the ERβ (DBD and hinge regions) were PCR amplified using the hERβ expression vector pCMV5hERβ and primers with 5′-NheI and 3′-HindIII compatible sites (forward primer: 5′-GCTATGGCTAGCCCTGTTACTGGTCCA-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GAGTCTAAGCTTTACTACAGCAGCAGCTCCCGCAC-3′). Oligonucleotides encoding the FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDK) with 5′-NdeI and 3′-NheI restriction enzyme sites (forward oligo: 5′-TATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGG-3′ and reverse oligo: 5′-CTAGCCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCA-3′) were annealed and ligated toNheI and HindIII-digested PCR product. The resulting fragment (flag:hERβDBD) was ligated to theNdeI/HindIII-cut pET-28a(+) and used to transform the DH5α strain of Escherichia coli. Plasmids were checked for insertion of the flag:hERβDBD fragment by digestion withRsaI, and the junctions of the pET-28a(+):flag:hERβDBD plasmid were verified by DNA sequencing. FLAG-tagged ERα and ERβ were expressed and purified as previously described (23Loven M.A. Wood J.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Protein purity was assayed by Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE. ER concentration was determined using a hydroxyapatite binding assay (24Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CDα, which contained the DBD and hinge region of ERα, was expressed using the expression vector pET-21b(+):flag:hERαDBD (39Kim J. de Haan G. Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3173-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) kindly provided by David J. Shapiro (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). CDβ was constructed as described above to encode the region of ERβ (amino acids 134–260) corresponding to the region included in the ERα construct (amino acids 166–307). 500-ml cultures of transformed BL21DE3plysS cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. 10 μm ZnCl2 was added to help stabilize the DBD zinc fingers. Induced cultures were incubated for 3 h with shaking at 37 °C and then chilled on ice for 5 min and pelleted at 4700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed with one freeze/thaw cycle. 5 ml of TEGDZ (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μm ZnCl2, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) with 0.5% Triton X-100 was added to the cell lysate and incubated with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 142,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was discarded. Polyethyleneimine was added dropwise to the supernatant to 0.1%, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 142,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was diluted with 2 ml of TEGDZ and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose (A1205, Sigma) with rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. The CD-antibody complexes were washed and eluted as described for the full-length receptors (23Loven M.A. Wood J.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), except that the wash and elution buffers for CDα contained 400 mm NaCl. Plasmids encoding CDα/β (amino acids 189–250 of ERα and 219–256 of ERβ) and CDβ/α (amino acids 148–218 of ERβ and 251–288 of ERα) GST fusion proteins were cloned, expressed, and purified as described (46Melvin V.M.S. Edwards D.P. Proceedings, 83rd Annual Endocrine Society Meeting. The Endocrine Society, Denver, CO2001: 100Google Scholar). The GST moiety was removed by overnight digestion with 0.02 units/μl thrombin. Protein purity of CDα, CDβ, CDα/β, and CDβ/α was assessed on Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Circular permutation experiments were carried out with 427-bp DNA fragments isolated from the DNA bending vector B3ConsERE (41Nardulli A.M. Romine L.E. Carpo C. Greene G.L. Rainish B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 694-704PubMed Google Scholar). B3ConsERE was digested withEcoRI, HindIII, EcoRV,NheI, or BamHI to produce DNA fragments containing a consensus ERE near the 3′ end, at an intermediate 3′ position, in the middle of the fragment, at an intermediate 5′ position, or near the 5′ end, respectively. All DNA fragments were composed of identical nucleotide sequence and differed only in the location of the ERE. The DNA fragments were isolated and32P labeled as described (32Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Phasing analysis experiments were carried out with 280–290-bp DNA fragments containing an ERE 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, or 36-bp upstream of an intrinsic DNA bend. The DNA fragments were labeled as described (36Nardulli A.M. Grobner C. Cotter D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1064-1076PubMed Google Scholar). Vectors for DNA bending standards (47Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by A. Landy (Brown University, Providence, RI). DNA bending standards were prepared as described (32Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Receptor. 1993; 3: 247-255PubMed Google Scholar). For circular permutation analysis, gel mobility shift assays were performed with 50 fmol of purified baculovirus-expressed ERα or ERβ and 5000 cpm of32P-labeled ERE containing DNA fragments in binding buffer (10% glycerol, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.2 mmEDTA, pH 8.0) with 20 mm KCl, 50 ng of polydeoxyinosine-polydeoxycytidine poly (dI/dC), and 50 nmE2. For phasing analysis, gel mobility shift assays were performed with 10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA fragments containing an ERE and an intrinsic DNA bend in binding buffer with 50 μmZnCl2. Full-length receptor assays used 100 fmol of purified baculovirus-expressed ERα or ERβ and included 50 ng of poly(dI/dC), 20 mm KCl, and 50 nmE2 in the binding reaction buffer. Assays with truncated DBD-hinge proteins used 350 or 600 fmol of purified, bacterially expressed CDα or CDβ, respectively, and included 100 ng of poly(dI/dC) and 50 mm KCl (CDα) or no additional KCl (CDβ) in the binding buffer. Assays with chimeric DBD-CTE proteins utilized 50 or 10 fmol of purified, bacterially expressed CDα/β or CDβ/α, respectively, and included 100 ng of poly (dI/dC) and 50 mm or 10 mm KCl in the binding buffer. Reactions were incubated for 10–15 min at room temperature prior to fractionation on low ionic strength polyacrylamide gels (48Chodosh L.A. Buratowski S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, New York1989: 12.2.1-12.2.10Google Scholar) at 4 °C with buffer recirculation. 2500 cpm each of NheI- orBamHI-digested bending standards were included on each gel. The migration distances of the ER-DNA complexes, free probe, and DNA bending standards were determined using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The magnitude of each ER-induced distortion angle was determined from circular permutation experiments using two methods. The magnitude of the distortion angle was determined graphically by plotting the relative mobilities of the DNA bending standards (47Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) as a function of their known DNA bend angles. Polynomial regression analysis was used to determine the distortion angles induced by ERα and ERβ. Distortion angles were also determined using the empirical equation μm/μe = cos (kα/2), where μm is the relative mobility when the DNA bend is at the middle of the fragment and μe is the relative mobility when the bend is at the end of the fragment (47Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Ak value of 1.130 was determined by comparing the relative mobility of the DNA bending standards with the known bend angles as described (37Potthoff S.J. Romine L.E. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1095-1106PubMed Google Scholar). Calculations of DNA distortion angles are presented as the mean ± S.E. from four (ERα) or six (ERβ) independent experiments. The magnitude of the directed DNA bend was determined from phasing analysis experiments by comparing the relative mobility of each ER-DNA complex with the relative mobility of the DNA bending standards. The magnitude of the directed bend angle (αB) was determined using the equation tan (kαB/2) = (A PH/2)/(tan(kαC/2)) where αC is the intrinsic bend (49Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Science. 1991; 254: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The kvalue of 1.154 was determined as described for circular permutation analysis. The relative mobility of each ER-DNA complex was calculated by dividing the mobility of the ER-DNA complex by the mobility of the corresponding uncomplexed DNA fragment. Interexperimental variation was eliminated by dividing the relative mobility of the ER-DNA complex by the average relative mobility to obtain the normalized relative mobility (μ). The amplitude of phasing, A PH, was calculated by subtracting μmin from μmax. The fragment that migrated the farthest was determined using the greatest normalized relative mobility (μmax). Calculations for directed bend angles are presented as the mean ± S.E. from 4 (ERα), 10 (ERβ), 11 (CDα), 8 (CDβ), or 6 (CDα/β and CDβ/α) independent experiments. Transient transfection assays were used to examine the ability of ERα and ERβ to activate transcription of a CAT reporter vector containing a single consensus ERE. CHO cells were transiently transfected with an ERα or ERβ expression vector, a CAT reporter plasmid containing a consensus ERE upstream of a TATA box, and a β-galactosidase control vector. Both receptors significantly induced transcription in the presence of 10 nm E2 when compared with an ethanol vehicle (Fig. 1,p < 0.0001). ERα and ERβ induced 19- and 11-fold increases in transcription, respectively. Similar results were obtained in U2-OS cells. 2J. R. Schultz and A. M. Nardulli, unpublished data. Thus, ERα was a more potent activator of transcription than ERβ. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that binding of ERα to ERE-containing DNA fragments induces distortion and directed DNA bending (32Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Receptor. 1993; 3: 247-255PubMed Google Scholar, 34Nardulli A.M. Greene G.L. Shapiro D.J. Mol.

These studies and others suggest that the ability of a protein to induce conformational changes in DNA structure may be related to its ability to enhance transcription (50Wolffe A.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1100-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 51van der Vliet P.C. Verrijzer C.P. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 52Werner M.H. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Science. 1996; 271: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To determine whether ERβ induces distortion in ERE-containing DNA fragments and whether the magnitude of distortion might be related to the ability of ERα and ERβ to activate transcription, circular permutation analysis was carried out with ERα and ERβ. Circular permutation assays assess the migration of protein-DNA complexes through a native acrylamide gel to determine the magnitude of protein-induced DNA distortion. Because the geometry of a DNA fragment affects its migration through an acrylamide gel, a DNA fragment with a distortion near the end will migrate farther through the gel matrix than a DNA fragment with a distortion in the middle. 427-bp 32P-labeled DNA fragments containing a consensus ERE near the end, in the middle, or at an intermediate position in the DNA fragment were incubated with purified, baculovirus-expressed ERα or ERβ and fractionated on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. DNA bending standards, which contained 54, 72, or 90 ° intrinsic DNA bends (53Crothers D.M. Haran T.E. Nadeau J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7093-7096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Eckstein F. Lilley D. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 7. Springer, New York1994: 70-105Google Scholar) were also included on all gels. As seen in Fig.2 A, distinct differences in the migration of the ER-bound DNA fragments were observed with both ERα and ERβ. The migration of the receptor-DNA complexes was dependent on the location of the ERE in the DNA fragment. When the ERE was near the end of the DNA fragment (R, B), the ER-DNA complex migrated farther than when the ERE was present at an intermediate position in the DNA fragment (H, N). When the ERE was at the middle of the DNA fragment (V), the ER-DNA complex migrated even more slowly indicating that both ERα and ERβ induced distortion in DNA structure. The magnitude of distortion was determined from four (ERα) or six (ERβ) independent experiments using two methods. Graphical analysis, which compares the relative mobilities of the receptor-DNA complexes with the relative mobilities of the DNA bending standards (Fig. 2 B), indicated that ERα and ERβ induced distortion angles of 74.6 ± 4.1° and 63.9 ± 0.9°, respectively. Using the empirical equation μm/μe = cos (kα/2) (47Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), similar distortion angles were obtained for ERα (76.0 ± 4.3°) and ERβ (64.5 ± 1.0°). Thus, both ERα and ERβ induce distortion in ERE-containing DNA fragments, but ERα induces a larger distortion angle than ERβ (p < 0.05 comparing ERα to ERβ by Student's t test). Circular permutation analysis can be used to determine the degree of distortion or flexibility induced by protein binding, but it does not provide information about the orientation of a DNA bend. To determine the magnitude and direction of receptor-induced DNA bending, phasing analysis was carried out. This assay utilizes DNA fragments with an ERE 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, or 36 bp upstream of an intrinsic DNA bend so that the orientation of the ER-induced and the intrinsic DNA bends are incrementally varied over one turn of the DNA helix. At some point the ER-induced and intrinsic DNA bends will be in phase, a larger DNA bend will be produced, and the migration of the ER-DNA complex through the gel matrix will be inhibited. Likewise, at some point the ER-induced and intrinsic DNA bends will be out of phase, the DNA fragment will have a smaller overall bend, and the ER-DNA complex will migrate more rapidly through the gel. By monitoring the migration of the ER-DNA complexes, it is possible to determine the magnitude and direction of an ER-induced DNA bend. 32P-labeled DNA fragments containing an ERE and an intrinsic DNA bend were incubated with purified, baculovirus-expressed ERα or ERβ and separated on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. When the DNA fragment contained an ERE 32 bp upstream of the intrinsic DNA bend, the ERα-DNA complex migrated more rapidly (Fig.3). This 32-bp spacing places the ERE and intrinsic DNA bend on the same side of the DNA helix. The rapid migration of the ERα-DNA complex indicates that the ERα-induced and intrinsic DNA bends must be out of phase. Since we know that the intrinsic DNA bend is oriented toward the minor groove of the DNA helix (55Zinkel S.S. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the ERα-induced DNA bend must be directed toward the major groove of the DNA helix. Combined data from four independent experiments indicated that the ERα-directed DNA bend was 11.0 ± 1.6°. These findings are in good agreement with earlier work examining ERα-induced DNA bending (37Potthoff S.J. Romine L.E. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1095-1106PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when ERβ was incubated with these same DNA fragments, none of the ERβ-bound DNA fragments consistently migrated farther than the others in 10 ind"

Immobilized anti-CD43 monoclonal antibody (mAb) MEM-59 has been previously shown to induce apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitors. In this study we show that it also triggers apoptosis of the myeloid progenitor-derived cell line TF-1. The kinetics of the MEM-59-induced apoptosis were unusually slow, with the first apoptotic cells appearing 36–48 h after their contact with the immobilized antibody; in 5 days, 90% of the cells were dead. CD43-mediated apoptosis was enhanced by coimmobilized anti-CD45 mAb and partly suppressed by coimmobilized anti-CD50 (ICAM-3) or anti-CD99 mAb. The MEM-59-triggered apoptosis of TF-1 cells was also inhibited by the overexpression of an apoptotic regulator, Daxx. CD43-mediated apoptosis was preceded by the repression of the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor AP-1. DNA array screening revealed that the expression of several genes encoding apoptosis-regulating proteins, including 14-3-3 proteins and the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor β-subunit, was repressed in TF-1 cells bound to immobilized MEM-59. The down-regulation of 14-3-3 proteins and GM-CSF receptor β was accompanied by translocation of the proapoptotic protein Bad to the mitochondria. These results suggest that engagement of CD43 may, presumably through the repressing transcription, initiate a Bad-dependent apoptotic pathway.

DNA array screening revealed that the expression of several genes encoding apoptosis-regulating proteins, including 14-3-3 proteins and the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor β-subunit, was repressed in TF-1 cells bound to immobilized MEM-59. The down-regulation of 14-3-3 proteins and GM-CSF receptor β was accompanied by translocation of the proapoptotic protein Bad to the mitochondria. These results suggest that engagement of CD43 may, presumably through the repressing transcription, initiate a Bad-dependent apoptotic pathway. intercellular adhesion molecule 1 fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor β-subunit of GM-CSF receptor interleukin monoclonal antibody(ies) 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide nuclear factor phosphate-buffered saline CD43, a highly glycosylated and sialylated transmembrane type I protein, is expressed abundantly on the surface of hematopoietic cells, including hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (1Rosenstein Y.

This extension, the highly negative charge of the CD43 extracellular domain, and variability in its post-translational modifications suggest that CD43 is responsible for the regulation of the first contacts between cells, either adhesive or repulsive (6Ostberg J.R.

Variability in the glycosylation of the extracellular domain of CD43 was observed during T cell activation. The mobility of CD43 glycosylation isoforms on SDS-polyacrylamide gels ranged from 95 to 130 kDa, and the isoforms were expressed differently on resting versus activated T cells (7Jones A.T.

Molecular events that accompany CD43-induced T cell activation include increased binding of protein-tyrosine kinase Fyn to the intracellular part of CD43, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc and the proto-oncogene Vav. CD43-induced signaling then leads to elevated DNA binding of AP-1, NFκB, and NF-AT and to increased expression of IL-2, CD69, and CD40 ligand (12Pedraza-Alva G. Merida L.B. Burakoff S.J.

Activation of the protein-tyrosine kinases Syk and Lyn and phospholipase Cγ by antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD43 in hematopoietic progenitor cells resulted in increased homotypic adhesion, and it also enhanced the integrin-dependent adhesion of human cord blood cells to fibronectin (27Tada J.

Similar treatment also enhanced the affinity of β1 and β2 integrins in T cells and increased homotypic aggregation of the human mast cell line HMC-1 through the activation of protein kinase C and tyrosine kinases (29Sanchez-Mateos P.

In contrast, the interaction of proliferating hematopoietic progenitors with plastic-immobilized anti-CD43 mAb MEM-59 led to their apoptosis (32Bazil V. Brandt J. Tsukamoto A. Hoffman R. Blood. 1995; 86: 502-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bazil V. Brandt J. Chen S. Roeding M. Luens K. Tsukamoto A. Hoffman R. Blood. 1996; 87: 1272-1281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bazil V. Brandt J.E. Hoffman R. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, stem cells and nonproliferating progenitors were resistant to MEM-59-induced apoptosis. Another anti-CD43 mAb also triggered apoptosis in the Jurkat T cell line (35Brown T.J. Shuford W.W. Wang W.C. Nadler S.G. Bailey T.S. Marquardt H. Mittler R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27686-27695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the apoptosis induced in hematopoietic progenitors by the cross-linking of their surface CD43 with a putative ligand in bone marrow may be important in regulating their growth and/or differentiation. Very little is known about the molecular basis of the apoptotic signaling triggered by the cross-linking of CD43. Therefore, in the present study we investigated processes that led to or affected apoptosis induced by immobilized anti-CD43 mAb MEM-59 in a model myeloid progenitor-derived cell line TF-1. TF-1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10 ng/ml recombinant GM-CSF (Leukomax, Shering-Plough, Basel, Switzerland) (36Kitamura T. Tojo A. Kuwaki T. Chiba S. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. Blood. 1989; 73: 375-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Daxx-overexpressing TF-1 cells (TF-1/Daxx) were grown in the same culture medium containing in addition 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). The monoclonal antibodies MEM-59 (CD43), MEM-28 (CD45), MEM-131 (CD99), MEM-171 (CD50), and AFP-01 (human α-fetoprotein), previously prepared and characterized in the Prague laboratory, were purified on a protein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Anti-Myc tag mAb 9E10 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibodies against 14-3-3 proteins, Bad, and GM-CSF receptor β subunit (GM-CSF Rβ) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). mAb TU-01 (α-tubulin) was kindly provided by Dr. P. Dráber (Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague), mAb αF1 (mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase) by Dr. J. Houštek (Institute of Physiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic), and mAb 1C1 recognizing GM-CSF Rβ by Dr. A. F. Lopez (Hanson Center for Cancer Research, Adelaide, Australia). The annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide apoptosis determination kit was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA), and GAM was from Sigma. The intracellular parts of human cDNAs encoding CD43 (amino acids 275–400) and human Fas (CD95) (amino acids 191–335) were amplified from a leukocyte cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR and subcloned into the yeast two-hybrid bait vector pLexA (CLONTECH). Daxx cDNA (provided by Dr. A. Pluta, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore) was subcloned in-frame into a modified pCDNA3 plasmid containing the Myc epitope upstream of the cloning site. This construct and the parental plasmid were transfected into TF-1 cells, and Myc-Daxx expressing cells (TF-1/Daxx) or mock-transfected cells were selected by limiting dilution in a culture medium containing in addition 1 mg/ml G418. The oligonucleotides (5′ → 3′) used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays were CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA (AP-1) and AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGCC (NFκB). Mutations that compromised specific DNA binding were TGACTCA to TGACTTG (AP-1) and GGGGACTTT to GGCGACTTT (NFκB). The expression of GM-CSF Rβ and β-actin mRNAs was determined by reverse transcription-PCR using oligonucleotides GACAGGCCGTGGAAGTGGAGAG, GGCCGGGGAGGAAGCAATAG, and CCTGGGGGCTTCTTGACTTG (reverse transcription primer) (GM-CSF Rβ), and GACGAGGCCCAGAGCAAGAG and GGGCCGGACTCATCGTACTC (β-actin). All PCR-made constructs were sequenced. For cell treatment with immobilized mAbs, tissue culture plates/dishes were incubated with purified mAbs (100 μg/ml in PBS) at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed three times with PBS. Cells at the indicated cell concentrations were then added and incubated with the immobilized mAbs for the various time periods indicated. Cells in suspension were treated with a mixture of soluble mAb and GAM (both at 10 μg/ml). Cells attached to the MEM-59-coated plastic were released by treating with 0.25 mg/mlO-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, Canada) at 37 °C for 45 min. The enzyme treatment did not affect the viability of the treated cells (32Bazil V. Brandt J. Tsukamoto A. Hoffman R. Blood. 1995; 86: 502-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bazil V. Brandt J. Chen S. Roeding M. Luens K. Tsukamoto A. Hoffman R. Blood. 1996; 87: 1272-1281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The released cells were then harvested by gentle pipetting and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSort, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For immunostaining, cells were incubated in the staining buffer (PBS containing 0.2% gelatin and 0.1% sodium azide) with 50 μg/ml cell surface marker-specific mAb on ice for 1 h. After washing, cells were incubated in the staining buffer containing FITC-conjugated GAM (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cells were then washed, resuspended in the staining buffer, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The apoptosis assay using annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. pLexA-CD43(ICP) was used for screening a Jurkat cDNA library cloned in the prey vector pB42AD (CLONTECH) for interacting proteins. The control plasmid, pLexA-lamin, was also supplied by CLONTECH. Postscreening analysis, including β-galactosidase assays, was done according to the manufacturer's protocols (CLONTECH). MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS, Sigma) was added to cells cultured in 96-well plates to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, an equal volume of acid isopropyl alcohol (0.04 m HCl in isopropyl alcohol) was added, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The liquid in the wells was resuspended by pipetting, and the absorbance at 570 nm was determined using a Victor microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nuclear extracts from TF-1 cells, both untreated and treated with mAbs, were prepared by hypotonic lysis and nuclei extraction. Cells in suspension were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS and hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9 at 4 °C), resuspended in 3 packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer and, after a 15-min incubation on ice, lysed by repeatedly passing the cell suspension through a 30-gauge needle. The nuclei were centrifuged and washed with hypotonic buffer, and nuclear proteins were extracted with hypotonic buffer containing in addition 0.35 m NaCl. The nuclear extract was centrifuged (13,000 × g at 2 °C for 30 min), and the supernatant was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The protein concentration in the nuclear extracts was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Cells attached to the immobilized MEM-59 were washed on the culture dishes and scraped in hypotonic buffer; nuclear proteins were purified as above. Equal amounts of the nuclear extracts (3 μg, usually 1–2 μl) were incubated in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9, at 20 °C) with the32P end-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 20 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in native 6% polyacrylamide gel, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified by a PhosphorImager BAS-5000 (FUJIFILM Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). For the analysis of protein expression, cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunodetected by specific antibodies. Heavy membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of TF-1 cells were prepared as described by Rice and Lindsay (37Rice J.E. Lindsay J.G. Graham J.M. Rickwood D. Subcellular Fractionation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 107-142Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic fraction was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 2 h) and contained no membranes (i.e. it was F1F0-ATPase-negative). Gel loadings were normalized either to α-tubulin (whole cell lysates and cytoplasmic fractions) or to F1F0-ATPase (heavy membrane fractions) signals. Total RNA from TF-1 cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with additional acid phenol and two chloroform extractions. Its purity was confirmed by spectrophotometry (A 260/A 280 > 1.8) and by agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and specific primers. Synthesized cDNA was used either for semiquantitative PCR with gene-specific primer pairs or for the hybridization of nylon membranes with the DNA arrays of apoptosis-related genes (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). In the latter case, [α-32P]dCTP was included into the reverse transcription reaction. The PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. 32P-Labeled cDNAs were hybridized according to the manufacturer's protocols (R&D Systems) to DNA array membranes containing 198 cloned, apoptosis-related cDNAs, including cytokines, their receptors, caspases, signal transduction, and other factors. Radioactive signals on the membranes were detected by autoradiography and quantified by a PhosphorImager BAS-5000. Relative gene expression was calculated as the ratio of averaged signals of the duplicate gene spots on the membrane hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA isolated from TF-1 cells treated with the immobilized MEM-59 to the signals of corresponding spots on the membrane hybridized with the 32P-labeled cDNA from cells treated either with the control mAb or with a mixture of soluble MEM-59 and GAM (10 μg/ml of both). The results were normalized by the corresponding ratios of the signals of the housekeeping genesL19 and HLA-A. Immobilized, but not soluble, anti-CD43 mAb MEM-59 specifically induced apoptosis of human hematopoietic progenitors (32Bazil V. Brandt J. Tsukamoto A. Hoffman R. Blood. 1995; 86: 502-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bazil V. Brandt J. Chen S. Roeding M. Luens K. Tsukamoto A. Hoffman R. Blood. 1996; 87: 1272-1281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these cells are available only in limited amounts, and therefore we looked for a suitable model cell line. The hematopoietic progenitor-derived cell line TF-1 was such a sensitive model. In the presence of plastic-immobilized CD43 mAb MEM-43, the relative proliferation of these cells in a 5-day assay was only 14 ± 2% of the control (Fig.1 A), and as expected, soluble MEM-59 did not affect their growth. 2L. Andera, unpublished data. Suppression of TF-1 cell proliferation by the immobilized MEM-59 was clearly caused by the induction of apoptosis, as shown by annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining (Fig. 1 B). TF-1 cells strongly expressed the early hematopoietic markers CD34 and CD38 as well as other surface markers such as CD5, CD7, CD29, CD45, CD50, CD99, and CD147.2Coimmobilization of mAbs to most of these molecules (in addition to the immobilized MEM-59) had no further effect, but coimmobilized mAb to CD45 (MEM-28) further enhanced the growth inhibitory effect, although coimmobilized mAb MEM-131 (CD99) or MEM-171 (CD50) partially counteracted it (Fig. 1 A), obviously because of reduced apoptosis (Fig. 1 B). Proteins interacting with the intracellular part of CD43 should mediate or regulate proximal steps in the apoptotic signaling induced by mAb-cross-linked CD43. Thus, we employed yeast two-hybrid screening of a Jurkat cDNA library and searched for proteins interacting with the intracellular part of CD43. The screening revealed that the C-terminal part of the protein Daxx specifically interacted with the intracellular part of CD43 (Table I.). Under the same conditions, Daxx also interacted with the intracellular part of Fas (CD95) used as a positive control (see “Discussion”). To examine whether Daxx could affect the MEM-59-induced apoptosis of TF-1 cells, human Daxx with the N-terminal Myc tag was overexpressed in TF-1 cells (Fig. 2 A). TF-1/Daxx cells were markedly more resistant to MEM-59-induced growth suppression/induction of apoptosis than the parental or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Overexpression of Daxx also significantly reduced the growth inhibitory effect of coimmobilized CD43 (MEM-59) and CD45 (MEM-28) mAbs, and in combination with coimmobilized CD50 (MEM-171) or CD99 (MEM-131) mAbs almost eliminated MEM-59-induced growth suppression and apoptosis (Fig.2, B and C).Table IIntracellular parts (ICP) of CD43 and Fas (CD95) interact with the C-terminal part of Daxx in the yeast two-hybrid systemBaitPreyβ-Galactosidase activityunitspLexA-laminpB42AD-Daxx(558–740)3 ± 0.5pLexA-CD43(ICP)pB42AD-Daxx(558–740)59 ± 4.6pLexA-Fas(ICP)pB42AD-Daxx(558–740)54 ± 5.2pLexA-laminpB42AD-Daxx(1–740)2.5 ± 0.8pLexA-CD43(ICP)pB42AD-Daxx(1–740)15 ± 2.3pLexA-Fas(ICP)pB42AD-Daxx(1–740)13 ± 2.7Liquid culture β-galactosidase assays were performed, and the β-galactosidase activities of yeast cell extracts were calculated as described in the Yeast Protocol Handbook (Clontech).

The relatively slow kinetics of the immobilized MEM-59-induced apoptosis of TF-1 cells suggested a possible requirement of de novo transcription/proteosynthesis. However, inhibition of proteosynthesis even by very low doses of cycloheximide led to relatively rapid (within 24–36 h) apoptosis of TF-1 cells. 3S̆. S̆ı́mová, unpublished data. In agreement with previous data on Jurkat T cells (20Santana M.A. Pedraza-Alva G. Olivares-Zavaleta N. Madrid-Marina V. Hor̆ejs̆i V. Burakoff S.J. Rosenstein Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31460-31468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the cross-linking of CD43 with soluble MEM-59 significantly enhanced the DNA binding activities of the transcription factors AP-1 and NFκB in TF-1 cells as well (Fig.3). In contrast, the cross-linking of CD43 with immobilized MEM-59 resulted in a substantial inhibition of the DNA binding activity of AP-1 (3-fold after 6 h of treatment), whereas the DNA binding activity of NFκB remained almost unchanged with only a slight increase after 2 h of treatment (Fig. 3). The next set of experiments was aimed at the characterization of the MEM-59-induced changes in the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Hybridization of 32P-labeled cDNA from control and TF-1 cells treated with immobilized MEM-59 mAb to a nylon membrane with a cDNA array of apoptosis-related genes revealed that the immobilized MEM-59 suppressed the expression of genes encoding IL-2 Rα, ref-1, GM-CSF Rβ, and 14-3-3s, whereas the expression of IL-4 Rα was up-regulated (TableII, center column). The down-regulation of ref-1, GM-CSF Rβ, and 14-3-3 gene expression was specifically elicited by immobilized mAb, whereas changes in the expression of the IL-2 Rγ and IL-4 Rα genes were also induced by soluble mAb (Table II, right column).Table IIChanges in the expression of some genes in TF-1 cells treated with either immobilized or soluble MEM-59GeneRelative change in gene expression in TF-1 cells treated withImmobilized MEM-59 versus control (AFP-01) mAbImmobilized MEM-59 versus soluble MEM-59IL-4 Rα2.430.9214–3-3 proteins0.360.46IL-2 Rγ0.571.04GM-CSF Rβ0.450.41ref-10.530.43Relative changes in gene expression were determined from a PhosphorImager analysis of apoptotic cDNA array membranes (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab Relative changes in gene expression were determined from a PhosphorImager analysis of apoptotic cDNA array membranes (see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunostaining of Western blots with pan-specific anti-14-3-3 mAb confirmed that a 24-h treatment of TF-1 cells with immobilized MEM-59 already caused a significant down-regulation of 14-3-3 proteins (Fig.4 A). This decrease in the 14-3-3 protein level was less pronounced when MEM-59 was coimmobilized with CD99 mAb and was not observed in TF-1 cells overexpressing Daxx (Fig. 4 A). Because none of the tested anti-GM-CSF Rβ mAbs recognized the GM-CSF receptor on the surface of TF-1 cells with sufficient sensitivity or under the conditions of Western blotting, the expression of GM-CSF Rβ was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. As expected, a 24-h treatment of cells with immobilized MEM-59 suppressed the expression of GM-CSF Rβ mRNA in TF-1 cells and, to lesser extent, also in TF-1/Daxx cells (Fig. 4 B). Coimmobilized antiapoptotic CD99 mAb did not modulate this suppression. However, after 44 h of treatment, the expression of GM-CSF Rβ mRNA was restored in both TF-1 and TF-1/Daxx cells (Fig. 4 B). Both 14-3-3 proteins (by sequestering of serine-phosphorylated proteins) and the GM-CSF receptor (through activation of Akt kinase) cooperate in inhibiting the apoptosis-inducing activity of the proapoptotic protein Bad (38Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 39Datta R.S. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol.

Thus, down-regulation of both of these effectors should lead to the translocation of Bad from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria. Indeed, a 24-h treatment of TF-1 cells with immobilized MEM-59 already induced a significant mobilization of Bad to the mitochondrial (heavy membrane) fraction (Fig.4 C).

The 3β-HSD enzyme exists as multiple isoforms in humans and rodents, each the product of a distinct gene (1Clarke T.R. Bain P.A. Burmeister M. Payne A.H. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To date, six isoforms have been identified in mouse and two in human. These isoforms are expressed in a tissue- and temporal-specific manner (1Clarke T.R. Bain P.A. Burmeister M. Payne A.H. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 2Park C.-H.J. Abbaszade I.G. Payne A.H. Mol. Cell.

In the mouse, the two major isoforms involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis are 3β-HSD I and 3β-HSD VI. 3β-HSD I is the major or only isoform expressed in gonads and adrenal glands, whereas 3β-HSD VI is the only isoform expressed in giant trophoblast cells during mid-pregnancy (3Abbaszade I.G. Arensburg J. Park C.H. Kasa-Vubu J.Z. Orly J. Payne A.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The orthologous isoforms in human are human 3β-HSD II, the isoform expressed in the gonads and adrenal glands (6Rheaume E. Lachance Y. Zhao H.-F. Breton N. Dumont M. de Launoit Y. Trudel C. Luu-The V. Simard J. Labrie F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and human 3β-HSD I (7Luu-The V. Lachance Y. Labrie C. Leblanc G. Thomas J.L. Strickler R.C. Labrie F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1310-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Guerin S.L. Leclerc S. Verreault H.L.F. Luu-The V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1583-1597PubMed Google Scholar), the only isoform expressed in placenta throughout pregnancy. The expression of human 3β-HSD I in placenta is essential for placental progesterone biosynthesis and, thus, is vital for maintenance of pregnancy (9Miller W.L. Clin. Perinatol. 1998; 25: 799-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of human 3β-HSD I in placental progesterone biosynthesis, we have shown that mouse 3β-HSD VI is required for progesterone biosynthesis in giant trophoblast cells between embryonic day (E) 9.5 and E10.5 (10Peng L. Orly J. Payne A.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Progesterone biosynthesis from cholesterol requires the activity of two enzymes, cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc) which catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and 3β-HSD which catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. This latter step is brought about by distinct tissue-specific isoforms of 3β-HSD. Previous studies designed to identify placental-specific regulatory elements in the human placental-specific 3β-HSD promoter were unsuccessful (8Guerin S.L. Leclerc S. Verreault H.L.F. Luu-The V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1583-1597PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, identity of transcription factors essential for placental-specific expression of P450scc remains to be resolved (11Huang N. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2852-2858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, the question is whether there is a unique tissue-specific transcription factor or factors required for the expression of the trophoblast-specific isoform of 3β-HSD as well as the other enzyme required for progesterone biosynthesis, P450scc, in human placenta and mouse giant trophoblast cells. In the present study, we identify a 66-bp trophoblast-specific enhancer element located between −2896 and −2831 5′ of the transcription start site of the murine 3β-HSD VI promoter and demonstrate the requirement for two transcription factors, AP-2γ, and the homeodomain protein, Distal-less 3 (Dlx 3), in determining trophoblast-specific expression of the 3β-HSD VI gene. Dlx 3 is a member of a family comprising at least six Dlx genes sharing a homeobox sequence similar to that found in the Drosophila Distal-less gene (12Bendall A.J. Abate-Shen C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Dlx proteins are transcriptional activators which play an essential role during vertebrate development (12Bendall A.J. Abate-Shen C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). AP-2γ is a member of a family of three closely related and evolutionary conserved sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins which include AP-2α, AP-2β, and AP-2γ (13Hilger-Eversheim K. Moser M. Schorle H. Buettner R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 260: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Dlx 3 and AP-2γ are expressed in both murine and human placental trophoblast cells and are required for the placental-specific expression of a number of genes (14Morasso M.I. Grinberg A. Robinson G.

Our studies demonstrate that these two transcription factors regulating the trophoblast-specific expression of the steroidogenic enzyme, 3β-HSD VI, are conserved in both murine and human trophoblast cells. This is the first report on the identification of at least two of the transcription factors required for placental-specific expression of 3β-HSD in humans and mice. A λ phage 129/SvJ mouse genomic library from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) was screened with an 180-bp probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, which includes 18 bp of coding region and 167 bp of 3′-untranslated region of the 3β-HSD VI cDNA (3Abbaszade I.G. Arensburg J. Park C.H. Kasa-Vubu J.Z. Orly J. Payne A.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Prehybridization and hydribization were performed as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch F.H. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two clones (402 and 602) were identified to represent 3β-HSD VI. The clones were subjected to restriction enzyme and Southern blot analysis using exon-specific oligonucleotide probes (exon 2, 5′-CCAGAGGATTGTCCAGTTG-3′; exon 3, 5′-GACATCTAGGATGGTCTG-3′; exon 4, 5′-AGGAAGCTCACAGTTTCCA-3′). Restriction fragments from clone 402 were subcloned into the pBluescript-KS vector and subjected to further analysis to identify the location of exon 1 and to establish the start site of transcription. 5′-RACE was carried out using a Marathon cDNA library from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) prepared from a 7-day pregnant mouse implantation site. The primary amplification was performed as described by the manufacturer using touchdown PCR techniques with adapter primer AP1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and 3β-HSD VI-specific primer GSP1 (5′-GCCCGTACAACCGAGAATATT-3′, 628 bp 3′ of ATG in exon 4) (20Roux K.H. Hecker K.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 39-45PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary amplification was performed using nested adapter primer AP2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′) and 3β-HSD-specific primer GSP2 (5′-CAGACCATCCTAGATGTC-3′, 283 bp 3′ of ATG in exon 3). The secondary PCR product was subject to sequencing using primers AP2 or GSP2. Timed pregnant C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were killed by CO2 followed by cervical dislocation at E9.5 and E10.5, and the uterine horns were removed and placed in phosphate-buffered saline for further isolation of giant trophoblast cells as described (5Arensburg J. Payne A.H. Orly J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5220-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). E9.5 and E10.5 implantation sites were separated from the myometrium and the embryos were removed. Giant trophoblast cells were gently removed by scraping the inner face of the hemi-implantation site and collected for preparation of RNA or proteins. The transcription initiation site of 3β-HSD VI was determined using the primer extension kit from Promega (Madison, MI). Messenger RNA was isolated from E10.5 mouse giant trophoblast cells and adult mouse testes using the QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Primer GSP3 (5′-GGTTCTGATCTCTGCAAAGGAACCAG-3′, 132 bp 5′ of exon 1 end), which is specific for 3β-HSD VI, was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 100 fmol of labeled primer and 3–5 μg of mRNA were hybridized at 65 °C for 20 min, followed by gradual cooling to room temperature. The reactions were extended by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 1 h and 15 min and followed by heating at 99 °C for 5 min. The extended DNA fragments were precipitated with ethanol and subjected to electrophoresis in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To characterize the promoter region of the mouse 3β-HSD VI gene, a series of 5′ deletions spanning between −4700 and −40 (Fig. 3) were subcloned into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector pA3LUC at theSmaI-HindIII sites (21Wood W.M. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14840-14847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To make heterologous constructs, different fragments, including −3004/−1989, −3004/−2500, −3004/−2723, and −2722/−2500, were subcloned into a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter-driven luciferase reporter vector TK164LUC at the SmaI site. Further deletions within the −3004/−2723 fragment, including sequences −2896/−2725, −2830/−2725, and −2896/−2831, were generated by PCR using primers with SmaI site added at the 5′ end and subcloned into TK164LUC/SmaI. The sequences −2896/−2857 and −2867/−2831 were synthesized with a half SmaI site added in both 5′ and 3′ ends and subcloned into TK164LUC/SmaI. The PCR fidelity and orientations of inserts of each construct were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. Mutations in the potential AP-2, TEF, or Dlx 3-binding sites in each footprint (FPI, FPII, and FPIII) (Table I) that were identified by DNase I footprinting were introduced by the ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the instructions given in the manual. Positive clones were identified and verified by sequencing in the DNA Sequencing Facility at Stanford University.Table ISequences of some oligonucleotides for EMSAsOligo nameSequence (5′→3′)Position (5′→3′)FPICAGTTGGCCTGTAGGCAAGT−2891 /−2872mFPICAGTTGGCCTGggtaccAGT−2891 /−2872Ker1 (31)GTGTAGCCTGCAGGCCCACAFPIICTGGAGGGCATTCTATTGAC−2871 /−2852mFPIICTGGAGGaagctcTATTGAC−2871 /−2852FPIIITTGACTGATAATTGGTGTGA−2856 /−2837mFPIIITTGACaagcttTTGGTGTGA−2856 /−2837Nkx2–5 (34)TCGGGATCCGAGTTAATTGCGCJRE (18)GTACTTGGTGTAATTACCAT Open table in a new tab Both human choriocarcinoma cells, JEG-3 (ATCC HTB-36) and monkey kidney tumor cells, COS-7 (ATCC CRL-1651), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 50 μg/ml gentamycin supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD). MA-10 cells, a mouse Leydig tumor cell line (a gift of Dr. Mario Ascoli), were grown in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium containing 15% horse serum. JEG-3 and MA-10 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were plated at a density of 0.5–1 × 105 cells/20-mm well. After 20 h of culture, the testing plasmid (0.5 μg DNA) and pSV2β-Gal (23Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) (0.1 μg of DNA) were co-transfected in triplicate. Following transfection (42 h), cells were lysed using the Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). The activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured according to the manufacturer's description. The luciferase activity of each construct was normalized to the co-transfected β-galactosidase activity. Crude nuclear extracts from JEG-3 and MA-10 cells were prepared as described (24Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 192499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from E10.5 giant trophoblast cells and E15.5 placental tissues were isolated using the 1-h minipreparation techniques (25Deryckere F. Gannon F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 405PubMed Google Scholar). Total protein was quantitated by Bradford assay and normalized against extraction buffer. The extracts were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use for footprinting or EMSA. DNase I footprinting was carried out using Promega's core footprinting kit with modifications. To generate the probe, the 120-bp fragment (−2916/−2800) amplified from PCR was subcloned into the pBluescript-KS vector at theEcoRI-HindIII sites. The insert was sequenced for verification. A 167-bp/XbaI-XhoI fragment released from the vector was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Digestion with AccI orSpeI resulted in formation of a sense or antisense probe, respectively. Increasing amounts of crude nuclear extract were incubated with the labeled probe (10,000 cpm) at room temperature for 10 min, followed by digestion with 6 units of DNase I at room temperature for 3 min. The digested products were extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1), ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed using 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EMSAs were performed as described previously (26Howard G. Peng L. Hyde J.F. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4649-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The 20-μl binding reaction containing 5–10 μg of crude nuclear extracts and 0.05–0.25 ng of radiolabeled probes (50,000 cpm/reaction) was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The sequences of the double-stranded oligonucleotides used for EMSAs are listed in TableI. For competition assays, a 50–500-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added to the binding reaction mixture. For supershift assays, 2 μg of polyclonal antisera to AP-2α, AP-2γ, Nkx2-5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Dlx 3 (a gift of Dr. Mark Roberson), or preimmune sera were added to the mixture prior to the addition of the probe. The binding reactions were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Extracts of MA-10 cells, transfected COS-7 cells, E9.5 or E10.5 giant trophoblast cells, or adrenal glands or testes from 50-day-old mice were prepared by homogenization in extraction buffer followed by centrifugation as described previously (3Abbaszade I.G. Arensburg J. Park C.H. Kasa-Vubu J.Z. Orly J. Payne A.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Membranes were first incubated with antiserum generated against human placental 3β-HSD and then with the horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and exposed using the Enhanced ChemiLuminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL). Cryosections (8 μm) of implantation sites from E9.5 and E10.5 were subjected to in situhybridization as described (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996Google Scholar) using a 359-bp 35S-labeled sense or antisense cRNA probe representing 45 bp from the 3′ end of the coding region and 314 bp from the 3′-untranslated region of 3β-HSD VI cDNA (3Abbaszade I.G. Arensburg J. Park C.H. Kasa-Vubu J.Z. Orly J. Payne A.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Slides were exposed at 4 °C and developed after 4 days. The slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined under light microscopy with bright- and dark-field illumination. To characterize the 3β-HSD VI gene, a λ phage genomic DNA library was screened with a 3β-HSD VI cDNA probe. Two phage clones, 402 and 602, were identified as encompassing the entire 3β-HSD VI gene. Restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis revealed that clone 402 contains ∼10 kb of 5′-flanking region, and exon 2 through exon 4 ending at theSacI site in the 3′-untranslated region (3Abbaszade I.G. Arensburg J. Park C.H. Kasa-Vubu J.Z. Orly J. Payne A.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas clone 602 contains a portion of intron 2, exon 3, exon 4, and 9 kb 3′-flanking region (Fig.1 A). 5′-RACE analysis was performed to identify the exon 1 sequence. The 3′ 340-bp sequences from the 5′-RACE PCR product matched with known cDNA sequences including 206 bp of exon 2 and 134 bp of exon 3 (3Abbaszade I.G. Arensburg J. Park C.H. Kasa-Vubu J.Z. Orly J. Payne A.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To confirm that the new sequence from the 5′-RACE represents the exon 1 sequence, reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using RNA isolated from E10.5 mouse giant trophoblast cells and from mouse testicular tissues with a forward primer designed from the 5′-RACE exon 1 sequence and a backward primer designed from the known sequence of exon 2 (3Abbaszade I.G. Arensburg J. Park C.H. Kasa-Vubu J.Z. Orly J. Payne A.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A fragment of the expected size was obtained. Thus, exon 1 was identified and the size of intron 1 was established to be 3.1 kb, which differs from human 3β-HSD I or mouse 3β-HSD I (1Clarke T.R. Bain P.A. Burmeister M. Payne A.H. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The transcription start site for 3β-HSD VI was confirmed by primer extension (Fig. 1 B). Using mRNA from adult mouse testes and from E10.5 mouse giant trophoblast cells, a single transcription start site was identified at a guanosine residue 315 bp 5′ of the translation initiation codon in exon 2 which defines the size of exon 1 as 252 bp. We previously reported the expression of 3β-HSD mRNA and protein in mouse giant trophoblast cells at E9.5 (5Arensburg J. Payne A.H. Orly J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5220-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the earlier study did not use isoform-specific probes for the identification of 3β-HSD. To determine the isoform-specific expression of 3β-HSD VI, in situ hybridization of sections of E9.5 and E10.5 implantation sites were analyzed using a 3β-HSD VI-specific antisense probe (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.2 A shows exclusive expression of 3β-HSD VI mRNA in giant trophoblast cells at E9.5 and E10.5 with considerably greater expression at E10.5. No expression of 3β-HSD VI mRNA was observed in decidua or embryo. The increase in 3β-HSD VI mRNA in giant trophoblast cells at E10.5 is accompanied by a parallel increase in 3β-HSD VI protein as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). In gonads and adrenal glands expression of steroidogenic enzymes is dependent on steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) (27Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 28Leers-Sucheta S. Morohashi-Ken-ichirou Mason J.I. Melner M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7960-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). SF-1 null mice develop normal placental trophoblast cells that express steroidogenic enzymes (29Sadovsky Y. Crawford P.A. Woodson K.G. Polish J.A. Clements M.A. Tourtellotte L.M. Simburger K. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10939-10943Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) indicating that this factor is not involved in placental-specific expression of steroidogenic enzymes. Our studies (Table II) demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of the murine 3β-HSD VI proximal promoter transfected into JEG-3 cells that do not contain SF-1, is 22-fold greater than the transcriptional activity of the gonadal- and adrenal-specific 3β-HSD I promoter. Furthermore, co-transfection with an SF-1 expression vector resulted in a dose-dependent increase in 3β-HSD I transcriptional activity, but had no effect on 3β-HSD VI transcriptional activity. Thus, SF-1 is not required for expression of the 3β-HSD VI enzyme in the placenta.Table IIEffect of SF-1 on transcriptional activity of the mouse 3β-HSD I and VI promoters in JEG-3 cellsSF-1Luciferase activity2-aLuciferase activity relative to pGL3-Basic.3β-HSD I3β-HSD VIng00.715.820034004.18004.917.416005.8The sequences −359/+35 of 3β-HSD I and −443/+33 of 3β-HSD VI were subcloned into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega), respectively, and then transfected into JEG-3 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data from one experiment carried out in triplicates.2-a Luciferase activity relative to pGL3-Basic. Open table in a new tab The sequences −359/+35 of 3β-HSD I and −443/+33 of 3β-HSD VI were subcloned into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega), respectively, and then transfected into JEG-3 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data from one experiment carried out in triplicates. Because of the lack of a mouse trophoblast cell line and the difficulty in obtaining mouse primary giant trophoblast cells for transfection studies, the human placental choriocarcinoma cell line, JEG-3, was chosen for the transfection studies described herein. JEG-3 cells express human 3β-HSD I (30Tremblay Y. Beaudoin C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the tissue-specific ortholog to mouse 3β-HSD VI. To establish trophoblast-specific expression, nonplacental cell lines, both mouse Leydig tumor cells (MA-10) and monkey kidney cells (COS-7), were also used for the promoter and enhancer analyses of the mouse 3β-HSD VI gene. To characterize the promoter sequences involved in transcriptional regulation of the 3β-HSD VI gene in trophoblast cells, a series of 5′ deletions of the 3β-HSD VI gene, spanning from −4700 to −40 5′ of exon 1 (Fig. 3), were subcloned into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector, pA3LUC, and transiently transfected into JEG-3, MA-10, or COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, a marked increase in basal transcription activity was observed in all three cell lines when the promoter sequence was increased from −40 to −91, suggesting that a common positive cis-acting element is located between −40 and −91, although the luciferase activity was ∼10-fold greater in JEG-3 and MA-10 cells compared with COS-7 cells. A database analysis of this sequence shows that there are several potential binding sites for transcription factors CREB and Sp1 in the segment between −40 and −91. No further analysis was performed with this proximal sequence. As larger fragments from −91 to −4700 were included, the basal transcription activities remained essentially the same in both MA-10 and COS-7 cells. In contrast, a large increase in basal activity was observed in JEG-3 cells with fragments greater than −1989. The results suggest that the sequence between −3004 and −1989 may contain a trophoblast-specific enhancer element. To determine whether the sequence between −3004 and −1989 has the properties of an enhancer, this region was subcloned 5′ of the heterologous thymidine kinase (tk) promoter either in the sense or antisense direction and transfected into JEG-3, MA-10, and COS-7 cells. Results of the transfections are shown in Fig.4. The sequence between −3004 and −1989 increased tk promoter activity over 8-fold in either the sense or antisense directions in JEG-3 cells, but not in COS-7 or MA-10 cells. These data indicate that the sequence between −3004 and −1989 has the characteristics of a trophoblast-specific enhancer element. Because a further increase in transcriptional activity was observed between −4700 and −3004 (Fig. 3), this 1700-bp fragment was also subcloned 5′ of the tk promoter and transfected into JEG-3 cells. No increase in the promoter activity was observed with this fragment (data not shown). To further define the regulatory domains within the −3004/−1989 fragment of the 3β-HSD VI promoter, subsequent deletions were made and subcloned 5′ of the tk promoter. Fig.5 A shows the results of the deletion constructs transfected into JEG-3, MA-10, and COS-7 cells. No enhancer activity with any of the deletion constructs was observed in MA-10 or COS-7 cells. In contrast, in JEG-3 cells, deletions of the 3′ sequence from −1989 to −2500, did not change enhancer activity compared with the −3004/−1989 fragment. Further deletion from −2500 to −2723 displayed similar enhancer activity. The data suggest that the 282-bp fragment between −3004 and −2723 contains the trophoblast-specific enhancer element. To characterize the minimal enhancer region, additional 5′ deletions within −3004/−2723 were made and subcloned 5′ of the tkhet"

To identify amino acids and functions required for transcriptional repression, we employed PCR-directed mutagenesis to create a panel of mutated M2 proteins. Biochemical and functional analyses of these mutated proteins indicate that functions encoded by the M2 carboxyl terminus, such as DNA binding activity and the capacity to form multimeric complexes, are not required or sufficient for transcriptional repression. Instead, a 93-amino acid portion of the trans-activation domain was shown to be the minimal portion of M2 required to block Sp-dependent gene expression. Transcriptional analysis of three Sp-dependent promoters showed that mutations sustained by many M2 proteins result in promoter-specific effects. Regions of M2 required for physical interactions with five TATA box-associated factors (TAFIIs) were mapped, and mutations that disrupt the interaction of M2 with two of these proteins, TAFII70 and TAFII40, were identified. We conclude that Sp3- mediated transcriptional repression is due, at least in part, to competition for promoter-specific transcription factors.

TATA box-associated factors glutathione S-transferase dihydrofolate reductase hemagglutinin 6-(2-deoxy-β-d-ribofuranosyl)-3,4-dihydro-8H-pyrimido-[4,5-c][1,2]oxazin-7-one triphosphate Sp1 is the founding member of a family of five transcription factors, Sp1–5, that govern the expression of a wide variety of mammalian genes (for review, see Ref. 1Phillipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 27: 2991-3000Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Sp1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed nuclear phosphoprotein that has been divided into five sub-domains based upon their respective functions (2Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 3Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The Sp1trans-activation domain is composed of three sub-domains termed A–C, each of which is capable of stimulating transcription if tethered to DNA via a DNA-binding domain. Sub-domains A and B are composed by serine- and threonine-rich regions as well as glutamine-rich regions. The glutamine-rich portions of A and B are believed to be required for trans-activation, whereas the function(s) of the serine/threonine-rich sub-regions is(are) less well understood. Domain C carries a number of charged amino acids and weakly stimulates transcription in the absence of domains A or B. Carboxyl-terminal to the domain C is a region featuring three Cys2-His2 zinc “fingers” required for sequence-specific DNA binding to GC-rich promoter elements. A carboxyl-terminal domain, termed D, facilitates protein multimerization and is essential for synergistic trans-activation of promoters with multiple Sp-binding sites. Sp1 associates with a large number of transcription-associated proteins, including components of the basal transcription complex (e.g.hTAFII130/dTAFII110 and hTAFII55; Refs. 4Chiang C.-M. Roeder R.G.

As might be expected given the variety of proteins with which it interacts, protein-binding sites have been identified throughout Sp1. For example, hTAFII130/dTAFII110 interact with Sp1 via itstrans-activation domain; hTAFII55 binds the Sp1 zinc fingers, and E2F requires the zinc finger and D sub-domains of Sp1 for protein-protein interactions. A wide variety of extracellular stimuli have been shown to induce gene expression via discrete promoter elements bound by Sp1 and Sp3 (17–29). Moreover, subtle mutations that negate the association of Sp1/Sp3 with their cognate binding sites completely block the induction of such genes by their respective inducing agents. Although GC-rich elements within the promoters of many Sp1/Sp3-regulated genes have been identified and their necessity for induced transcription has been noted, it remains largely unclear how extracellular stimuli activate Sp1/Sp3-dependent genes. For example, in most instances treatment of cells with inducing agents does not lead to consistent alterations in (i) the abundance or subcellular localization of Sp1/Sp3, (ii) the affinity of Sp1/Sp3 for DNA, (iii) the formation of Sp1/Sp3 multimers, nor (iv) the post-translational modification Sp1/Sp3. Instead, extracellular stimuli may activate Sp-dependent genes via alterations in protein-protein interactions. For example, transforming growth factor-β induces p15Ink4B transcription by catalyzing the formation of protein complexes between Sp1 and members of the Smad family of transcription factors (30Feng X.-H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Whether regulated interactions between Sp family members and other factors account for the induced transcription of additional Sp-dependent genes remains to be determined. Several years ago we identified two novel Sp3-derived proteins, termed M1 and M2, that arise by internal translational initiation within the region of Sp3 mRNA that encodes the Sp3 B domain (31Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Sp3, M1, and M2 appear to be expressed in all mammalian cells and tissues at approximately equivalent levels independent of growth status or induction by extracellular stimuli. In contrast to full-length Sp3, M1 and M2 function as potent repressors of Sp-mediated transcription, and Sp3 is at least 10-fold more sensitive to M1/M2-mediated repression than is Sp1. Given that Sp3 encodes proteins with opposing activities, we reasoned that understanding their differential regulation may shed light on mechanisms governing the activity of Sp-dependent promoters. To understand further the mechanism(s) by which M1/M2 repress transcription, we prepared a panel of M2 proteins carrying a limited number of random amino acid substitutions and examined their capacity to function as transcriptional regulators of three Sp-regulated promoters: DHFR, p21, andMDR-1. Additionally, we examined each of these mutated proteins for their capacity to bind DNA, to form multimeric complexes with Sp family members, and to bind components of the basal transcription complex. These studies have resulted in the following observations. 1) Random mutagenesis generated a panel of mutated M2 proteins that carry “loss-of-function” and “gain-of-function” mutations. 2) Many amino acid substitutions affect M2-mediated repression in a promoter-specific fashion. 3) DNA binding activity and the capacity to multimerize are not required or sufficient for M2-mediated repression. 4) The minimal region required for transcriptional repression by M2 consists of 93 amino acids of the B domain. 5) Several components of the TAFII complex bind Sp1, Sp3, and M2 in vitro. 6) The binding of two TAFII1 proteins, TAFII70 and TAFII40, is compromised in several M2 mutants. We conclude from these observations that M1/M2-mediated repression occurs at least in part via the titration of one or more transcription factors that may be required in a promoter-specific fashion.

For quantitative protein/DNA binding assays, whole cell protein extracts prepared from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were incubated with a radiolabeled probe derived from the c-fos gene (5′-CCCTTGCGCCACCCCTCT-3′; see Ref. 32Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 597-608PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting protein-DNA complexes were quantified in situ using an InstantImager (Packard Instrument Co.). Volumes of these extracts that led to half-maximal binding of this probe were then employed in assays performed in triplicate with Sp-binding sites derived from theDHFR, p21, and MDR-1 genes and quantified in situ. Whole cell or nuclear extracts were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry transfer apparatus. Nitrocellulose filters were incubated with 5% milk in TBS-T (2.42 g/liter Tris, 8 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.6, 1 ml/liter Tween 20) from 1 h to overnight. Primary antibodies were diluted in TBS-T (anti-Sp3 at 1:2000 and anti-HA.11 at 1:1000), incubated with filters for 1 h at room temperature, and washed with TBS-T. Filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in TBS-T (anti-mouse, 1:10,000, Amersham Biosciences, or anti-rabbit, 1:40,000, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation and washed in TBS-T, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected using ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro transcribed/translated proteins were produced using a coupled reticulocyte lysate system (TNT; Promega, Inc.) with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and l-[35S]methionine (Tran35S-label; ICN). pBSK-Sp1/flu, pBSK-Sp3/flu, pCR-M2/flu, PCR-amplified mutated M2 cDNAs, and TAFIIconstructs were employed as templates for these reactions. Mutated M2 cDNAs in pPac were amplified and prepared for in vitrotranscription/translation using a 5′ T7 promoter-containing primer, a 3′ primer, and the PCR. Protein binding assays were performed as described (40Sterner J.M. Dew-Knight S. Musahl C. Kornbluth S. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2748-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). GST bead-bound proteins were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. We have shown previously that Sp1 and Sp3 stimulate transcription of theDHFR promoter and that Sp1/Sp3-mediated transcription is repressed by two isoforms of Sp3, termed M1 and M2, that arise via internal translational initiation (31Kennett S.B.

To determine whether these results were likely to reflect a general mechanism of transcriptional regulation, we extended our analyses to thep21 and MDR-1 promoters, two well characterized Sp-dependent promoters of physiologic and therapeutic interest. The p21-luciferase construct employed in these studies includes an Sp protein-binding site that is required for transcriptional stimulation by transforming growth factor-β, calcium, or sodium butyrate, as well as a second Sp protein-binding site that is also required for induction by sodium butyrate (19Datto M.B.

As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, the ectopic expression of Sp3 in Drosophila SL2 cells stimulated transcription of the DHFR, p21, andMDR-1 promoters to varying degrees. p21transcription was stimulated 40-fold more effectively thanMDR-1 and 12-fold more than the DHFR promoter. Analogous results were obtained for activation of each of these promoters by Sp1 (data not shown). Consistent with results reported previously for the DHFR promoter, co-expression of M1 or M2 with Sp1 or Sp3 resulted in repression of p21 andMDR-1 transcription (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Interestingly, the sensitivity of each promoter to M1/M2-mediated repression was noted to be promoter-specific. The promoter most acutely sensitive to activation by Sp1/Sp3, p21, exhibited the least sensitivity to M1/M2-mediated repression. In turn, a promoter that is only modestly activated by Sp1/Sp3, MDR-1, exhibited the greatest sensitivity to M1/M2-mediated repression. Sensitivity ofDHFR to Sp-mediated activation and repression was noted to fall between these two extremes. Given the results presented in Fig. 1, we conclude that intrinsic differences between Sp-dependent promoters influence the degrees to which they are activated by Sp1/Sp3 and repressed by M1/M2. Because Sp proteins activated and repressed the DHFR, p21, and MDR-1to varying degrees, we wished to determine whether these effects might be accounted for by inherent differences in their capacity to bind DNA. For example, the relative sensitivity of p21 to Sp3-mediated transcription and insensitivity to M2-mediated repression might be explained if Sp3 and M2 bind the p21 promoter with substantially different affinities. To address this issue, we performed a series of quantitative protein/DNA binding assays using radiolabeled DNA probes carrying Sp-binding sites from the DHFR,p21, and MDR-1 promoters. Recombinant baculovirus stocks encoding Sp1, Sp3, M1, or M2 proteins were prepared; Sf9 cells were infected with these viruses, and protein extracts from infected cells were normalized for DNA binding activity using a well characterized Sp protein-binding site derived from the mouse c-fos promoter. The volume of each protein extract that bound 50% of the c-fos probe was then employed in protein/DNA binding assays with six Sp protein-binding sites derived from the DHFR, p21, and MDR-1promoters. Each assay was performed in triplicate and quantitatedin situ. As shown in Table I, Sp proteins bound to each probe, and the capacity of a given Sp protein to bind these DNAs varied over a 3-fold range. Interestingly, little correlation was noted between the relative capacity of Sp proteins to bind these DNAs in vitro and the efficiencies with which they activate or repress transcription in vivo. For example, Sp1 and Sp3 bound the Sp-binding site derived from the MDR-1promoter more efficiently than a site derived from the p21promoter, yet MDR-1 is activated significantly less efficiently by both proteins in vivo. Similarly, Sp protein-binding sites derived from all three promoters were bound equivalently by M2, yet their sensitivity to M2-mediated repression varies over a 13-fold range in vivo. We conclude from these studies that the relative capacity of Sp proteins to stimulate or repress transcription is not directly correlated with the efficiency with which they interact with their cognate promoter binding sitesin vitro.Table IRelative binding of recombinant Sp proteins to oligonucleotides carrying Sp-binding sites derived from three Sp-dependent promotersSp proteinPromoterp21MDR-1DHFRDHFR-1DHFR-2DHFR-3DHFR-4Sp112.52.21.813.0Sp311.22.51.91.23.0M111.51.71.20.62.1M211110.51.4Protein extracts were prepared from Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus stocks encoding Sp family members, and the volume of each extract required to bind 50% of a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe derived from the c-fos promoter was determined.

https://openalex.org/W2026799941,"Abstract Electroneutral Na+-H+ exchange is present in virtually all cells, mediating the exchange of extracellular Na+ for intracellular H+ and, thus, plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular pH, cell volume, and transepithelial Na+ absorption. Recent transport studies demonstrated the presence of a novel chloride-dependent Na+-H+ exchange in the apical membrane of crypt cells of rat distal colon. We describe the cloning of a 2.5-kb full-length cDNA from rat distal colon that encodes 438 amino acids and has six putative transmembrane spanning domains. Of the 438 amino acids 375 amino acids at the N-terminal region are identical to Na+-H+ exchange (NHE)-1 isoform with the remaining 63 amino acids comprising a completely novel C terminus.In situ hybridization revealed that this transcript is expressed in colonic crypt cells, whereas Northern blot analysis established the presence of its 2.5-kb mRNA in multiple tissues. Despite its much smaller size compared with all other known Na+-H+ exchange isoforms, NHE-deficient PS120 fibroblasts stably transfected with this cDNA exhibited Na+-dependent intracellular pH recovery to an acid load that was chloride-dependent and inhibited both by 5-ethylisopropylamiloride, an amiloride analogue, and by 5′-nitro-2-(3-phenylproplyamino)benzoic acid, a Cl−channel blocker, but only minimally affected by 25 μm3-methylsulfonyl-4piperidonbenzoylguanidine, an NHE-1 and NHE-2 isoform inhibitor. In contrast to other Na+-H+ exchange isoforms in colonic epithelial cells, chloride-dependent Na+-H+ exchange mRNA abundance was increased by dietary sodium depletion. Based on these results we predict that chloride-dependent Na+-H+ exchange represents a new class of Na+-H+ exchangers that may regulate ion transport in several organs."

Previous studies have concentrated on assessing changes in mutant CFTR-mediated Cl− transport in response to chemical or pharmacological agents such as 4-phenylbutyrate, glycerol, and genistein. However, assessment of mutant CFTR-mediated regulation of Na+ transport in response to these pharmacological agents has received limited attention. We utilized theXenopus oocyte expression system to examine whether genistein restores ΔF508-CFTR regulatory interactions with ENaC, as previous studies have shown that ΔF508-CFTR is expressed at the oocyte cell surface (30Drumm M.L.

We observed that ΔF508-CFTR does not inhibit the functional expression of ENaC, in agreement with previous data (31Mall M. Hipper A. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ENaC did not enhance the functional expression of ΔF508-CFTR. However, we observed that genistein restores functional interactions between ΔF508-CFTR and ENaC, suggesting that combinations of pharmacologic agents may prove beneficial for the repair of mutant CFTR function. Forskolin, IBMX, and genistein were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were purchased from Fisher. Human CFTR (WT and ΔF508) and mouse ENaC were expressed in Xenopus oocytes essentially as described previously (7Jiang Q. Li J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13266-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, human WT-CFTR, human ΔF508-CFTR, and mouse α-, β-, and γ-ENaC cRNAs were prepared using a cRNA synthesis kit (mMESSAGE mMACHINE, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cRNA concentrations were determined spectroscopically. Oocytes obtained from adult female Xenopus laevis (NASCO, Fort Atkinson, WI) were enzymatically defolliculated and maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 0.3 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate). Each batch of oocytes obtained from an individual frog was injected with α-, β- and γ-subunits of ENaC (0.33 ng/subunit), WT-CFTR (10 ng), ΔF508-CFTR (10 ng), or a combination of ENaC and CFTR (WT or ΔF508) cRNAs dissolved in RNase-free water using a Nanoject II microinjector (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA). Whole cell current measurements were performed 24–48 h after injection using the two-electrode voltage clamp method as described previously (7Jiang Q. Li J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13266-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Oocytes were placed in a 1-ml chamber containing modified ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 5.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and impaled with micropipettes of 0.5–5-megaohm resistance filled with 3 m KCl. The whole cell currents were measured by voltage clamping the oocytes in 20-mV steps between −140 mV and +60 mV adjusted for base-line transmembrane potential. Whole cell currents (I) were digitized at 200 Hz during the voltage steps, recorded directly onto a hard disc, and analyzed using pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Ion replacement studies were performed in an identical manner except that equimolar N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) replaced Na+ in the ND96 solution. To reduce error due to series resistance, the voltage clamp (Axon Geneclamp 500B) was configured to clamp the bath potential to 0 mV. In this configuration, we independently monitored the oocyte membrane potential during our clamp protocol. We routinely observed membrane potentials that were <5% depolarized from our target holding potentials, despite high conductances observed in oocytes expressing ENaC and WT-CFTR. The difference in whole cell currents measured in the absence and presence of 10 μm amiloride was used to define the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current that was carried by ENaC. Activation of WT- or ΔF508-CFTR was accomplished by perfusion of the oocyte with buffer supplemented with 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX for 25 min (7Jiang Q. Li J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K.

In some experiments, this first step was followed by an incubation with 10 μmforskolin, 100 μm IBMX, and 50 μm genistein for 20 min. In all experiments, ΔF508-CFTR Cl− current was defined as the difference between current measured 20 min after perfusion with forskolin/IBMX (or 15 min after perfusion with forskolin/IBMX/genistein) and the current measured before forskolin/IBMX (±genistein) stimulation. Whole cell currents were recorded at −100 mV for comparisons. All measurements were performed at room temperature. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Student's t test. A pairwise t test was used for pre-/post-treatment in experiments using an individual oocyte. A two-tailed t test was used when comparing currents obtained from oocytes injected with a cRNA for a single transporter (i.e. ENaC or CFTR (WT or ΔF508)) versusoocytes co-injected with a cRNA for both ENaC and CFTR (WT or ΔF508).p values < 0.05 were accepted to indicate statistical significance. TheXenopus oocyte expression system was used to examine the functional expression of ΔF508-CFTR and its functional interaction with ENaC. Although ΔF508-CFTR is a “trafficking-defective” mutant, ΔF508-CFTR is delivered to the oocyte plasma membrane (30Drumm M.L. Wilkinson D.J. Smit L.S. Worrell R.T. Strong T.V. Frizzell R.A.

Temperatures ≤27 °C are permissive for ΔF508-CFTR trafficking (32Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J.

The two-electrode voltage clamp technique was used to measure whole cell currents at varying clamping potentials in oocytes expressing ΔF508-CFTR (Fig.1 A). I/V curves were obtained before and after 20 min of incubation with 10 μmforskolin, 100 μm IBMX to activate endogenous protein kinase A. Whole cell currents, measured at a clamp potential of −100 mV, increased 7.5-fold from −0.2 ± 0.0 to −1.5 ± 0.3 μA (n = 19) in response to forskolin/IBMX, in agreement with previous observations (30Drumm M.L.

Oocytes expressing αβγ-ENaC exhibited amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents (Fig. 1 B), as reported previously (7Jiang Q. Li J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

The amiloride-sensitive whole cell current, measured at a clamp potential of −100 mV, was −5.1 ± 1.4 μA (n = 9).

Fig. 2 shows whole cell currents measured at a holding potential of −100 mV in oocytes injected with cRNAs for WT-CFTR (10 ng) or αβγ-ENaC (0.33 ng/subunit) or co-injected with cRNAs for both WT-CFTR and αβγ-ENaC. Oocytes co-injected with both CFTR and ENaC expressed an amiloride-sensitive whole cell current (−1.3 ± 0.3 μA at −100 mV) in the absence of forskolin/IBMX. Following CFTR activation with forskolin/IBMX, the amiloride-sensitive whole cell current was reduced to −0.7 ± 0.2 μA (Fig. 2, n = 15, p < 0.01). The forskolin/IBMX-stimulated amiloride-insensitive whole cell current measured at a clamp potential of −100 mV in oocytes co-expressing WT-CFTR and ENaC (−7.6 ± 2.1 μA; n = 15) was 3.5-fold greater than that obtained in oocytes expressing CFTR alone (−2.2 ± 0.4 μA; n = 18; p = 0.01; Fig. 2). The larger forskolin/IBMX-stimulated amiloride-insensitive current in oocytes expressing both CFTR and ENaC, as compared with oocytes expressing CFTR alone, is in agreement with previous reports that ENaC enhances functional CFTR expression (5Chabot H.

Whole cell currents measured at a clamp potential of −100 mV in oocytes injected with cRNAs for either ΔF508-CFTR (10 ng), αβγ-ENaC (0.33 ng/subunit), or both ΔF508-CFTR and αβγ-ENaC are shown in Fig.3. Oocytes co-injected with both ΔF508-CFTR and ENaC expressed amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents (−5.1 ± 0.7 μA) in the absence of forskolin/IBMX. Following ΔF508-CFTR activation with forskolin/IBMX, the amiloride-sensitive whole cell current was essentially unchanged (−4.9 ± 0.6 μA, n = 19,p is not significant), in agreement with previous studies (31Mall M. Hipper A. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, forskolin/IBMX-stimulated whole cell currents in oocytes expressing ΔF508-CFTR alone (−1.3 ± 0.3 μA) and amiloride-insensitive forskolin/IBMX-stimulated whole cell currents in oocytes expressing ΔF508-CFTR and ENaC (−1.6 ± 0.3 μA) were similar in magnitude (n = 19; p is not significant). These data are consistent with a lack of functional regulatory interactions between ΔF508-CFTR and ENaC expressed inXenopus oocytes. Previous studies reported that the open probability of ΔF508-CFTR is lower than the open probability of WT-CFTR (35Dalemans W. Barbry P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1991; 354: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the open probabilities of both ΔF508-CFTR and WT-CFTR have been reported to increase in response to the isoflavone genistein (29Hwang T.C. Wang F. Yang I.C. Reenstra W.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C988-C998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether genistein restored functional interactions between ΔF508-CFTR and ENaC. Linear whole cell I/V relationships were observed in oocytes expressing ΔF508-CFTR (Fig. 4 A) or WT-CFTR (Fig. 4 B) after 15 min of incubation with 10 μm forskolin, 100 μm IBMX, 50 μm genistein. Similarly, oocytes expressing αβγ-ENaC and stimulated with forskolin/IBMX/genistein exhibited amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents with a linear I/V relationship (Fig. 4 C). Previous studies suggested that chronic treatment with genistein inhibits ENaC by reducing surface expression of Na+channels in A6 renal epithelial cells (36Matsumoto P.S. Ohara A. Duchatelle P. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C246-C250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Record R.D. Johnson M. Lee S. Blazer-Yost B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1079-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, protein kinase A activates ENaC in part via an increase in surface expression of channels (38Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 39Kleyman T.R. Ernst S.A. Coupaye-Gerard B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F506-F511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents were measured in oocytes expressing ENaC before and after 15 min of incubation with 10 μm forskolin, 100 μmIBMX, 50 μm genistein (Fig.5). Whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents modestly, but significantly, increased in response to forskolin/IBMX/genistein (−7.1 ± 1.0 μA (−forskolin/IBMX/genistein) versus −9.0 ± 0.9 μA (+forskolin/IBMX/genistein); n = 23; p= 0.004; Fig. 5). In contrast, amiloride-sensitive currents decreased in response to genistein alone (−7.3 ± 1.5 μA (ENaC − genistein); −4.0 ± 0.6 μA (ENaC + genistein);n = 8, p = 0.015). Forskolin/IBMX-stimulated whole cell currents in oocytes expressing ΔF508-CFTR alone increased 5.7-fold following the addition of 50 μm genistein (−0.3 ± 0.1 μA (−genistein)versus −1.7 ± 0.4 μA (+genistein);n = 23; p < 0.001; Fig. 5). Furthermore, the amiloride-insensitive component of the forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated current in oocytes expressing ΔF508-CFTR and αβγ-ENaC was 3.6-fold greater than the forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated current measured in oocytes expressing ΔF508-CFTR alone (−1.7 ± 0.4 μA (ΔF508-CFTR,n = 23) versus −6.2 ± 0.9 μA (ΔF508-CFTR/ENaC, n = 24); p < 0.001; Figs. 5 and 6). A 2.4 ± 0.5-fold (p < 0.05) increase in forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated amiloride-insensitive current in oocytes co-expressing ΔF508-CFTR/ENaC (n = 12), when compared with oocytes expressing ΔF508-CFTR alone (n= 13), was also observed when bath Na+ was replaced with the impermeant cation NMDG+ (Fig. 6). These data suggest that ENaC enhances the forskolin/IBMX/genistein-mediated activation of ΔF508-CFTR. Furthermore, this enhanced activation of ΔF508-CFTR is not dependent on ENaC-mediated Na+ transport. Whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents observed after stimulation by forskolin/IBMX/genistein in oocytes expressing ENaC and ΔF508-CFTR (−5.6 ± 0.6 μA, n = 24) were significantly lower than the amiloride-sensitive currents obtained after stimulation by forskolin/IBMX/genistein in oocytes expressing ENaC alone (−9.0 ± 0.9 μA, n = 23, p = 0.003). Although amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents significantly increased in oocyte expressing ENaC alone following stimulation by forskolin/IBMX/genistein (Fig. 5), the amiloride-sensitive currents recorded in oocytes co-expressing ENaC and ΔF508-CFTR remained stable following stimulation with forskolin/IBMX/genistein (−5.2 ± 0.7 (−forskolin/IBMX/genistein) versus −5.6 ± 0.6 μA (+forskolin/IBMX/genistein); n = 24; p is not significant). These data suggest that activation of ΔF508-CFTR by forskolin/IBMX in the presence of genistein partially restores CFTR-mediated inhibition of ENaC activity. Functional interactions between WT-CFTR and ENaC were examined in oocytes treated with genistein (Fig. 7). Whole cell currents measured in oocytes co-expressing WT-CFTR and ENaC in response to forskolin/IBMX/genistein were −13.0 ± 1.9 μA (n = 12; Fig. 7), 5.2-fold greater than forskolin/IBMX/genistein-stimulated currents in oocytes expressing CFTR alone (−2.5 ± 0.5 μA, n = 13,p < 0.001). Furthermore, oocytes co-expressing WT-CFTR and ENaC responded to forskolin/IBMX/genistein with a modest but statistically insignificant reduction in amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents (Fig. 7; −3.2 ± 0.6 μA (−forskolin/IBMX/genistein); −2.6 ± 0.5 μA (+forskolin/IBMX/genistein); n = 12; p is not significant). CFTR is a Cl−-selective channel as well as a regulator of other epithelial channels and transport proteins. In cystic fibrosis, the absence of CFTR in the airway epithelia leads to hyperactive ENaC, which is hypothesized to lead to enhanced reabsorption of airway fluids and impaired mucociliary clearance (40Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Parsons D. Picher M. Hirsh A.J. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). ENaC hyperactivity results in hyperpolarization of airway epithelia, as is evidenced by increases in the change in the transepithelial potential of the nasal airway in response to amiloride (41Knowles M.R. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 445-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of CFTR in sweat ducts leads to an enhancement in ENaC activity, suggesting that regulatory interactions between CFTR and ENaC may be tissue-specific (9Reddy M.M. Light M.J. Quinton P.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that regulatory interactions between CFTR and ENaC in airway epithelia are replicated in Xenopusoocytes. Functional expression of WT-CFTR, but not ΔF508-CFTR, is associated with an inhibition of functional ENaC expression in oocytes (31Mall M. Hipper A. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Such CFTR-mediated inhibition of ENaC is associated with a decrease in Na+ channel open probability, not with changes in levels of ENaC mRNA or protein expression (8Ling B.N. Zuckerman J.B. Lin C. Harte B.J. McNulty K.A. Smith P.R. Gomez L.M. Worrell R.T. Eaton D.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 594-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 42Stutts M.J.

Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C511-C518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The forskolin/IBMX-regulated inhibition of ENaC by CFTR does not require expression of the full-length CFTR protein. Inhibition of ENaC was observed when ENaC is co-expressed either with CFTR truncation mutants containing an intact first nucleotide binding domain (NBD-1) (44Schreiber R. Hopf A. Mall M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5310-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or with a CFTR peptide fragment containing NBD-1 and the regulatory (R) domain (45Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A similar NBD-1/R peptide fragment containing the G551D mutation did not demonstrate forskolin/IBMX-regulated inhibition of ENaC (45Kunzelmann K. Kiser G.L. Schreiber R. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ji et al. (6Ji H.L. Chalfant M.L. Jovov B. Lockhart J.P. Parker S.B. Fuller C.M. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27947-27956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrated that regulatory interactions between CFTR and ENaC were dependent on the presence of the carboxyl terminus of the β-subunit and the amino terminus of the γ-subunit of ENaC. It has been suggested that the ability of CFTR mutants to transport Cl− correlates with their ability to inhibit ENaC (4Briel M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 825-836Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 46Konig J. Schreiber R. Voelcker T. Mall M. Kunzelmann K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recent data have correlated levels of Cl− transport in oocytes expressing WT-CFTR with the degree of ENaC inhibition; higher levels of Cl− transport due to increased WT-CFTR expression are associated with increases in the extent of inhibition of ENaC (46Konig J. Schreiber R. Voelcker T. Mall M. Kunzelmann K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data with both WT-CFTR (Figs. 2 and 7) and ΔF508-CFTR (Figs. 3 and 5) suggest that levels of Cl−transport do not correlate with the degree of ENaC inhibition. For example, although we observed high levels of CFTR-mediated Cl− currents in oocytes co-injected with CFTR and ENaC following treatment with forskolin/IBMX/genistein, we did not observe significant inhibition of ENaC in oocytes expressing ENaC and CFTR following activation of CFTR (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the enhanced activation of ΔF508-CFTR by ENaC is not dependent on ENaC-mediated Na+ transport (Fig. 6). These data argue that Cl− and Na+ conductances are not the sole determinants of CFTR/ENaC interactions. Nagel and co-workers (47Nagel G. Szellas T. Riordan J.R. Friedrich T. Hartung K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggested that the apparent CFTR-mediated inhibition of ENaC reflected a series resistor error. Our voltage clamp was configured to clamp the bath potential to 0 mV to diminish the likelihood of series resistor errors. Furthermore, in this configuration, we independently monitored oocyte membrane potential during our clamp protocol, and even at high conductances, we routinely observed membrane potentials that were <5% depolarized from our target holding potentials. In addition, the cAMP-regulated conductance in oocytes co-expressing CFTR and ENaC was significantly greater than that observed in oocytes expressing CFTR alone (Fig. 5), in agreement with recent observations (5Chabot H. Vives M.F. Dagenais A. Grygorczyk C. Berthiaume Y. Grygorczyk R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Ji H.L. Chalfant M.L. Jovov B. Lockhart J.P.

Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13266-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This apparent stimulation of CFTR by the presence of ENaC (Figs. 2 and 7) and the restoration of the stimulation of ΔF508-CFTR by ENaC in the presence of genistein cannot be explained by series resistance errors (47Nagel G. Szellas T. Riordan J.R. Friedrich T. Hartung K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These data therefore provide further support for the presence of regulatory interactions between these proteins. Our data are potentially important in devising strategies for effecting chemical or pharmacological repair of mutant CFTR function. ΔF508-CFTR retains chloride transport properties but is mistrafficked and targeted for rapid intracellular degradation (22Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 23Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 24Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the repair of trafficking would sufficiently restore CFTR function to ameliorate the CFTR deficiency in cystic fibrosis (48Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Welch W.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, ΔF508-CFTR-mediated chloride transport can be restored by a number of physical or pharmacological maneuvers in vitro (49Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 1998; 10: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and to a small extent in vivo, using the protein repair agent sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (50Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, in this clinical trial, there was no change in nasal epithelial amiloride-sensitive potential in vivo with 4-phenylbutyrate (50Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This observation and the present data suggest that combinations of protein repair agents, such as 4-phenylbutyrate and genistein, may be necessary to restore ΔF508-CFTR function in vivo. We thank Dr. Shaohu Sheng for help with TEV experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2110666427,"Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) has been used for quantitative analysis of gene expression. We applied cluster analysis on multiple SAGE libraries derived from premalignant epidermal tissue (actinic keratosis), normal human epidermis, and cultured keratinocytes. The samples were obtained from skin biopsies without contamination by dermal tissue or blood. A total of 60,000 transcripts (tags) were analyzed. Two-way cluster analysis was applied to both the transcripts and the tissues, resulting in separation of the cultured cells from the epidermal samples, and clustering of many, presumably coregulated, genes. Two clusters of genes, strongly up-regulated in the tumor tissue compared with normal epidermis, were investigated in more detail. The differential expression of genes could be confirmed in actinic keratosis from four patients. Several of these genes have been previously associated with carcinogenesis or are likely to be important on the basis of their presumed function. Automated literature search tools show that a subgroup of these genes is coexpressed in other tissues and is part of an epidermal differentiation gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. We conclude that cluster analysis on large data sets uncovers clear partitions and correlations that could be confirmed by independent methods. We predict that these partitions will lead to biological interpretations that can be relevant for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2133718663,"In cardiac myocytes, Ca2+ is the second messenger of various physiological processes, including the excitation-contraction coupling phenomenon. Here, we examined how Ca2+ regulates cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Using an adult rat ventricular myocyte culture model, we found that ceramide (Cer) induces an apoptotic process that is highly sensitive to calcium: it is inhibited by the Ca2+buffer BAPTA-AM and is potentiated by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Cer-treated myocytes maintained their Ca2+ homeostasis and normal activity of their voltage-dependent sarcolemmal Ca2+ entry pathways but showed enhanced activity of B-type Ca2+ channels that were stimulated by Cer in the inside-out patch clamp configuration. Pharmacological modulations of B-type Ca2+ channels modulated Cer-induced apoptosis. Mitochondria were involved in Cer-induced apoptosis, as indicated by the inhibitory effect of cyclosporine A and caspase-9 inhibitor. Both the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the caspase-9 activation in Cer-treated myocytes were attenuated by blocking B-type Ca2+ channels. The mitochondrial Ca2+ content was evaluated as changes in [Ca2+]i after a short application of a mitochondrial uncoupler, FCCP, was increased in Cer-treated cells. Together, these results show that Ca2+ modulates Cer-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis through the coupling of B-type Ca2+ channels with mitochondria."
