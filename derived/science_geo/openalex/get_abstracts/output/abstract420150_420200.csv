https://openalex.org/W2146576596,"Advancement of biomedical applications of carbonaceous nanomaterials is hampered by their biopersistence and pro-inflammatory action in vivo. Here, we used myeloperoxidase knockout B6.129X1-MPO (MPO k/o) mice and showed that oxidation and clearance of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) from the lungs of these animals after pharyngeal aspiration was markedly less effective whereas the inflammatory response was more robust than in wild-type C57Bl/6 mice. Our results provide direct evidence for the participation of MPO - one of the key-orchestrators of inflammatory response - in the in vivo pulmonary oxidative biodegradation of SWCNT and suggest new ways to control the biopersistence of nanomaterials through genetic or pharmacological manipulations."

Inhibition of mTORC1 is thus regarded as a promising strategy in the treatment of tumors with elevated mTORC1 activity. We have recently identified niclosamide (a Food and Drug Administration-approved antihelminthic drug) as an inhibitor of mTORC1 signaling. In the present study, we explored possible mechanisms by which niclosamide may inhibit mTORC1 signaling. We tested whether niclosamide interferes with signaling cascades upstream of mTORC1, the catalytic activity of mTOR, or mTORC1 assembly. We found that niclosamide does not impair PI3K/Akt signaling, nor does it inhibit mTORC1 kinase activity. We also found that niclosamide does not interfere with mTORC1 assembly. Previous studies in helminths suggest that niclosamide disrupts pH homeostasis of the parasite. This prompted us to investigate whether niclosamide affects the pH balance of cancer cells. Experiments in both breast cancer cells and cell-free systems demonstrated that niclosamide possesses protonophoric activity in cells and in vitro. In cells, niclosamide dissipated protons (down their concentration gradient) from lysosomes to the cytosol, effectively lowering cytoplasmic pH. Notably, analysis of five niclosamide analogs revealed that the structural features of niclosamide required for protonophoric activity are also essential for mTORC1 inhibition. Furthermore, lowering cytoplasmic pH by means other than niclosamide treatment (e.g. incubation with propionic acid or bicarbonate withdrawal) recapitulated the inhibitory effects of niclosamide on mTORC1 signaling, lending support to a possible role for cytoplasmic pH in the control of mTORC1. Our data illustrate a potential mechanism for chemical inhibition of mTORC1 signaling involving modulation of cytoplasmic pH."
https://openalex.org/W2066447422,"Disinhibition over drug use, enhanced salience of drug use and decreased salience of natural reinforcers are thought to play an important role substance dependence. Whether this is also true for pathological gambling is unclear. To understand the effects of affective stimuli on response inhibition in problem gamblers (PRGs), we designed an affective Go/Nogo to examine the interaction between response inhibition and salience attribution in 16 PRGs and 15 healthy controls (HCs).Four affective blocks were presented with Go trials containing neutral, gamble, positive or negative affective pictures. The No-Go trials in these blocks contained neutral pictures. Outcomes of interest included percentage of impulsive errors and mean reaction times in the different blocks. Brain activity related to No-Go trials was assessed to measure response inhibition in the various affective conditions and brain activity related to Go trials was assessed to measure salience attribution.PRGs made fewer errors during gamble and positive trials than HCs, but were slower during all trials types. Compared to HCs, PRGs activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and ventral striatum to a greater extent while viewing gamble pictures. The dorsal lateral and inferior frontal cortex were more activated in PRGs than in HCs while viewing positive and negative pictures. During neutral inhibition, PRGs were slower but similar in accuracy to HCs, and showed more dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex activity. In contrast, during gamble and positive pictures PRGs performed better than HCs, and showed lower activation of the dorsolateral and anterior cingulate cortex.This study shows that gambling-related stimuli are more salient for PRGs than for HCs. PRGs seem to rely on compensatory brain activity to achieve similar performance during neutral response inhibition. A gambling-related or positive context appears to facilitate response inhibition as indicated by lower brain activity and fewer behavioural errors in PRGs."
https://openalex.org/W1986984347,"Background Stability is a crucial ecosystem feature gaining particular importance in face of increasing anthropogenic stressors. Biodiversity is considered to be a driving biotic force maintaining stability, and in this study we investigate how different indices of biodiversity affect the stability of communities in varied abiotic (composition of available resources) and biotic (invasion) contexts. Methodology/Principal Findings We set up microbial microcosms to study the effects of genotypic diversity on the reliability of community productivity, defined as the inverse of the coefficient of variation of across-treatment productivity, in different environmental contexts. We established a bacterial diversity gradient ranging from 1 to 8 Pseudomonas fluorescens genotypes and grew the communities in different resource environments or in the presence of model invasive species. Biodiversity significantly stabilized community productivity across treatments in both experiments. Path analyses revealed that different aspects of diversity determined stability: genotypic richness stabilized community productivity across resource environments, whereas functional diversity determined stability when subjected to invasion. Conclusions/Significance Biodiversity increases the stability of microbial communities against both biotic and abiotic environmental perturbations. Depending on stressor type, varying aspects of biodiversity contribute to the stability of ecosystem functions. The results suggest that both genetic and functional diversity need to be preserved to ensure buffering of communities against abiotic and biotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2040301423,"Threats to biodiversity resulting from habitat destruction and deterioration have been documented for many species, whilst climate change is regarded as increasingly impacting upon species' distribution and abundance. However, few studies have disentangled the relative importance of these two drivers in causing recent population declines. We quantify the relative importance of both processes by modelling annual variation in population growth of 18 farmland bird species in the UK as a function of measures of land-use intensity and weather. Modelled together, both had similar explanatory power in accounting for annual fluctuations in population growth. When these models were used to retrodict population trends for each species as a function of annual variation in land-use intensity and weather combined, and separately, retrodictions incorporating land-use intensity were more closely linked to observed population trends than retrodictions based only on weather, and closely matched the UK farmland bird index from 1970 onwards. Despite more stable land-use intensity in recent years, climate change (inferred from weather trends) has not overtaken land-use intensity as the dominant driver of bird populations."
https://openalex.org/W1979657596,"Fenretinide is a synthetic retinoid that is being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of breast cancer and insulin resistance, but its mechanism of action has been elusive. Recent in vitro data indicate that fenretinide inhibits dihydroceramide desaturase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of lipotoxic ceramides that antagonize insulin action. Because of this finding, we assessed whether fenretinide could improve insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in vitro and in vivo by controlling ceramide production. The effect of fenretinide on insulin action and the cellular lipidome was assessed in a number of lipid-challenged models including cultured myotubes and isolated muscles strips incubated with exogenous fatty acids and mice fed a high-fat diet. Insulin action was evaluated in the various models by measuring glucose uptake or disposal and the activation of Akt/PKB, a serine/threonine kinase that is obligate for insulin-stimulated anabolism. The effects of fenretinide on cellular lipid levels were assessed by LC-MS/MS. Fenretinide negated lipid-induced insulin resistance in each of the model systems assayed. Simultaneously, the drug depleted cells of ceramide, while promoting the accumulation of the precursor dihydroceramide, a substrate for the reaction catalyzed by Des1. These data suggest that fenretinide improves insulin sensitivity, at least in part, by inhibiting Des1 and suggest that therapeutics targeting this enzyme may be a viable therapeutic means for normalizing glucose homeostasis in the overweight and diabetic."
https://openalex.org/W2170063995,"When mice are subjected to 7-day calorie restriction (40% of normal food intake), body fat disappears, but blood glucose is maintained as long as the animals produce ghrelin, an octanoylated peptide that stimulates growth hormone secretion. Mice can be rendered ghrelin-deficient by knock-out of the gene encoding either ghrelin O-acyltransferase, which attaches the required octanoate, or ghrelin itself. Calorie-restricted, fat-depleted ghrelin O-acyltransferase or ghrelin knock-out mice fail to show the normal increase in growth hormone and become profoundly hypoglycemic when fasted for 18–23 h. Glucose production in Goat−/− mice was reduced by 60% when compared with similarly treated WT mice. Plasma lactate and pyruvate were also low. Injection of lactate, pyruvate, alanine, or a fatty acid restored blood glucose in Goat−/− mice. Thus, when body fat is reduced by calorie restriction, ghrelin stimulates growth hormone secretion, which allows maintenance of glucose production, even when food intake is eliminated. In humans with anorexia nervosa or kwashiorkor, ghrelin and growth hormone are known to be elevated, just as they are in fat-depleted mice. We suggest that these two hormones prolong survival in starved humans as they do in mice.

We suggest that these two hormones prolong survival in starved humans as they do in mice. Chronic starvation is a repeated threat to survival of animals of all species. Indeed, ∼15% of the current human population is estimated to suffer from severe malnutrition, and one-half of all deaths in children less than 5 years of age (∼6 million deaths per year) arise from malnutrition (1.Svedberg P. How many people are malnourished?.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2011; 31: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2.Bryce J. Boschi-Pinto C. Shibuya K.

Over the centuries, starvation has exerted profound evolutionary pressure that has selected for a variety of adaptive mechanisms to support life. Paramount among these mechanisms is the necessity to maintain blood sugar concentrations sufficient for brain function (3.Cahill Jr., G.F. Fuel metabolism in starvation.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2006; 26: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The adaptive mechanisms are particularly strained when chronic starvation has depleted the body of its other source of energy, namely fatty acids stored as triglycerides (3.Cahill Jr., G.F. Fuel metabolism in starvation.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2006; 26: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 4.Nass R.M. Gaylinn B.D. Rogol A.D. Thorner M.O.

Recently, our laboratory has begun to study the adaptation to chronic starvation, focusing on the essential roles of two peptide hormones: ghrelin and growth hormone (5.Zhao T.J. Liang G. Li R.L.

Ghrelin is a peptide hormone of 28 amino acids that contains an 8-carbon fatty acid, octanoate, attached in ester linkage to serine-3 (8.Kojima M. Kangawa K. Ghrelin: Structure and function.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 495-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Most ghrelin is produced in the stomach. The peptide was discovered based on its ability to stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary, an action that absolutely requires the octanoate adduct (9.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Ghrelin is a growth-hormone-releasing acylated peptide from stomach.Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7234) Google Scholar). Two observations in rodents and humans linked ghrelin to appetite control: 1) administration of excess ghrelin was shown to increase food intake (10.Tschöp M. Smiley D.L. Heiman M.L.

However, an essential role of ghrelin in controlling food intake in rodents was ruled out by gene knock-out experiments that demonstrated little, if any, change in food intake when animals were rendered deficient in ghrelin (15.Wortley K.E.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7467-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Ghrelin was linked to starvation when we showed that Goat knock-out mice were unable to maintain their blood sugar levels in a viable range when the animals were subjected to severe chronic calorie restriction (5.Zhao T.J. Liang G. Li R.L. Xie X. Sleeman M.W. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7467-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In these experiments, WT mice and Goat−/− homozygotes were fed diets containing only 40% of the calories that they normally would consume. Under these conditions, WT and Goat−/− mice both lost ∼30% of body weight within 72 h. Over this time, body fat stores were drastically depleted, so that body fat accounted for less than 2% of body weight. Despite this depletion, WT mice maintained blood sugar levels in the range of 60 mg/dl and showed normal activity. In contrast, after 3 days of calorie restriction, Goat−/− mice began to exhibit a gradual fall in blood sugar, reaching as low as 20 mg/dl on days 7–9, at which point the animals were moribund. The adaptation of WT mice to starvation was accompanied by increases in the plasma concentrations of ghrelin and growth hormone, which rose higher each day. These increases did not occur in the Goat−/− mice. Administration of either ghrelin or growth hormone by osmotic minipump restored the ability of the Goat−/− mice to maintain blood sugar levels and survive the severe calorie restriction (5.Zhao T.J. Liang G. Li R.L. Xie X. Sleeman M.W. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7467-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These previous studies did not address the mechanism for hypoglycemia in the ghrelin-deficient mice. The current studies were designed to probe the mechanism for the profound hypoglycemia in the calorie-restricted, ghrelin-deficient mice. Our experiments reveal: 1) that hypoglycemia occurs only when an acute starvation of 20 h is superimposed on the adipose-depleted state; 2) that this hypoglycemia is caused by reduced glucose production associated with marked decreases in plasma concentrations of lactate and pyruvate, two major substrates for gluconeogenesis (18.Exton J.H. Gluconeogenesis.Metabolism. 1972; 21: 945-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 19.Ruderman N.B. Muscle amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis.Annu. Rev. Med. 1975; 26: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); 3) that blood glucose can be restored to WT levels by injection of lactate, pyruvate, and alanine, all of which are readily converted to glucose (3.Cahill Jr., G.F. Fuel metabolism in starvation.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2006; 26: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 19.Ruderman N.B. Muscle amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis.Annu. Rev. Med. 1975; 26: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); and 4) that the reductions in plasma lactate levels and glucose production can be reversed by injection of a medium chain fatty acid that cannot be converted to glucose but can provide a necessary source of energy for gluconeogenesis in these fat-depleted mice. We obtained an Ascensia Contour (blood glucose meter) from Bayer (Leverkusen, Germany); heparin from Hospira (Lake Forest, IL); [3-3H]glucose (14 Ci/mmol) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO); sodium lactate, sodium pyruvate, sodium octanoate, alanine, p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, and aprotinin from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Goat−/− mice were generated as previously described (5.Zhao T.J. Liang G. Li R.L. Xie X. Sleeman M.W. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) is essential for growth hormone-mediated survival of calorie-restricted mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

(20.Wortley K.E. del Rincon J.P. Murray J.D. Garcia K. Iida K. Thorner M.O. Sleeman M.W. Absence of ghrelin protects against early-onset obesity.J. Clin.

Both mouse lines, on a mixed C57BL/6J and DBA background, were housed in colony cages with 12-h light/12-h dark cycles. The dark cycle began at 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. The chow diet consisted of Teklad mouse/rat diet 7002 from Harlan Teklad Global Diets (Houston, TX). This diet contains 3.1 kcal/g of metabolizable energy, of which 18% of calories are from fat, 49% are from carbohydrates, and 33% are from protein. All of the animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Blood was drawn from tail vein or retro-orbital sinus and collected on ice in EDTA-coated tubes containing p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid (final concentration, 1 mm) and/or aprotinin (250 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml for glucagon measurement). Plasma was separated immediately and stored without treatment at −80 °C except for samples used for measurement of ghrelin, amino acids, lactate, and pyruvate. For measurement of ghrelin, plasma samples were treated with HCl (final concentration, 0.1 m) before freezing. For measurement of lactate and pyruvate plasma samples were deproteinized using 70% acetone and then lyophilized. Octanoylated ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin were measured by immunoassay kits that distinguished both forms of the peptide (catalogue number A05117 and A05118; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Plasma levels of lactate and pyruvate and tissue content of glycogen were measured with commercial assay kits from Biovision (Milpitas, CA). Plasma levels of the following hormones were measured with commercial kits from the indicated vendor: growth hormone (Cayman Chemical), free fatty acids (Wako, Richmond, VA), β-hydroxybutyrate (Pointe, Canton, MI), glucagon and fibroblast growth factor-21 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and insulin (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL). Plasma amino acid levels were determined with a Hitachi L-8900 amino acid analyzer. Calorie restriction was carried out as previously described (5.Zhao T.J. Liang G. Li R.L. Xie X. Sleeman M.W. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) is essential for growth hormone-mediated survival of calorie-restricted mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7467-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). One week before initiation of calorie restriction, 8-week-old male littermates (WT and Goat−/−mice; WT and Ghrl−/−mice) were placed in individual cages and fed the chow diet ad libitum. During this week of acclimation, food intake was monitored to determine the average amount of food consumed daily by each mouse. Thereafter, the mice were subjected to 60% calorie restriction such that each mouse was fed at 6 p.m. every day with an amount of food equal to 40% of the daily amount consumed by the same mouse during the week of acclimation. Male WT and Goat−/− littermates (4 weeks old) were fed either the standard chow diet (18% calories from fat; see above under “Mice”) or a high fat diet (45% calories from fat; catalogue number D12451, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). After 4 weeks on the diet, the mice from each group were placed in individual cages and subjected to calorie restriction such that each mouse was fed at 6 p.m. with 1.4 g of chow diet. Body composition was measured every 1 or 2 days at 5 p.m. (Bruker Minispec mq7.5NMR analyzer), after which body weight and blood glucose measurements were made at 5:30 p.m. just prior to feeding. 8-week-old male WT and Goat−/− littermates were placed in individual cages and fed the chow diet ad libitum. Basal food intake was measured for each mouse during this week. Four days before being subjected to 60% calorie restriction, each mouse was implanted with a jugular vein catheter that was externalized at the back of the neck. The catheter was filled with a heparin/glycerol mixture (v/v, 1:3) and blocked with a metal plug. Starting at 4 p.m. on day 6 of calorie restriction, each mouse received a continuous infusion of [3-3H]glucose (31 dpm/fmol) based on a modification of previously described isotopic protocols (21.Altszuler N. Barkai A. Bjerknes C. Gottlieb B. Steele R. Glucose turnover values in the dog obtained with various species of labeled glucose.Am. J. Physiol. 1975; 229: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22.Katz H. Homan M. Butler P. Rizza R. Use of [3-3H]glucose and [6-14C]glucose to measure glucose turnover and glucose metabolism in humans.Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E17-E22PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were infused at 0.3 μCi/min from 0 to 20 min, followed by 0.1 μCi/min from 20 to 90 min. The mice were then bled from cut tails at 45, 60, 75, and 90 min after infusion. Blood glucose level was measured at each time point with a Bayer glucose meter. The content of 3H radioactivity in blood was measured as follows: 4 μl of plasma was deproteinized with barium hydroxide and zinc sulfate, after which the supernatant was evaporated, resuspended in 1 ml of water, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting in 10 ml of counting mixture (3a70B; Research Products International). Whole body glucose production was calculated by dividing the steady-state tracer infusion rate (0.1 μCi/min) adjusted for body weight (dpm/kg/min) by the plasma glucose specific activity (dpm/mg) (23.Wolfe R.R. Chinkes D.L. Isotope tracers in metabolic research: Principles and practice of kinetic analysis. 2nd Ed. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2005: 215-257Google Scholar). In our previous studies of the role of ghrelin in starvation, we used mice that lacked ghrelin as a result of loss of the Goat gene (5.Zhao T.J. Liang G. Li R.L. Xie X. Sleeman M.W. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) is essential for growth hormone-mediated survival of calorie-restricted mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7467-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These animals continued to secrete des-acyl ghrelin. To rule out a contribution of des-acyl ghrelin to the starvation phenotype, we performed a calorie restriction experiment in previously described mice that lack the gene for preproghrelin (designated Ghrl) and hence cannot produce either ghrelin or des-acyl ghrelin. WT and Ghrl−/− mice were placed on a starvation diet containing 40% of their normal caloric intake. The animals were fed each day at 6 p.m. After 2 days of calorie restriction, WT and Ghrl−/− mice became ravenous and ate all of their food within 1 h. Blood was drawn at 5:30 p.m. after the animals had gone nearly 23 h without food. After 4 days of calorie restriction, both WT and Ghrl−/− mice lost ∼25% of their body weight (Fig. 1A), but unlike WT mice, ghrelin knock-out mice developed hypoglycemia, just as previously reported for Goat knock-out mice (Fig. 1B). The mice were killed on day 9 when the blood sugar in the Ghrl−/− mice had reached the range of 16–37 mg/dl. WT mice maintained blood sugars in the 50–60 mg/dl range throughout this period. By day 9, the WT mice exhibited marked increases in plasma ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin, and growth hormone (Fig. 1, C–E). Ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin were undetectable in the Ghrl−/− mice, and the rise in growth hormone was much less pronounced. To further investigate the hypoglycemia of ghrelin deficiency, we returned to the Goat knock-out mice. Remarkably, even after 8 days of calorie restriction Goat−/− mice had the same blood sugar level as WT mice when measured at 9 a.m., which was 14 h after the last meal (Fig. 2A). The WT mice maintained this blood sugar level throughout the day. However, in the Goat−/− mice, blood sugar began to decline after noon and reached its nadir at 6 p.m. Blood sugar rose above 100 mg/dl in both strains immediately after feeding. In WT mice, plasma ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin, and growth hormone levels began to climb after noon and reached a peak at 6 p.m., immediately before the next meal (Fig. 2, B–D). These values declined rapidly after feeding. In the Goat−/− mice, des-acyl ghrelin was the only one of these peptides to rise during the day, and it, too, declined after feeding (Fig. 2C). A nearly identical diurnal result was observed in Ghrl−/− mice except that their des-acyl ghrelin did not rise (supplemental Fig. S1). After 6 days of calorie restriction, plasma insulin was below the limit of detection in all mice from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and rose markedly after feeding in both mouse strains (Fig. 3B). In direct opposition, plasma glucagon levels were elevated throughout the day in both strains and fell dramatically after feeding (Fig. 3C). Plasma levels of free fatty acids (Fig. 3D) and the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (Fig. 3E) were similar in both strains, falling throughout the day and rising after feeding. Plasma levels of the gluconeogenic precursors lactate and pyruvate declined modestly throughout the day in WT mice (Fig. 3, F and G). The decline in the Goat−/− mice was much more profound. By 6 p.m., plasma lactate and pyruvate levels in Goat−/− mice were 48 and 54% of the levels seen in WT mice, respectively (p values, < 0.001). Supplemental Table SI compares various metabolic parameters in additional experiments in WT and Goat−/− mice at 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. after 7 days of calorie restriction. At 5:30 p.m., when compared with WT mice, Goat−/− mice showed significant decreases in blood sugar, growth hormone, lactate, and pyruvate (experiments A and C). Plasma free fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate were equally low in WT and Goat−/− mice at 5:30 p.m. (experiment C). At this time point, glycogen levels in liver and muscle were low in WT mice and even lower in Goat−/− mice (experiment D). In Goat−/− mice, glycogen depletion was extreme; at 5:30 p.m. the levels of liver and muscle glycogen were 4–5% of the levels seen at 9 a.m. Plasma triglycerides at 5:30 p.m. on day 7 in calorie-restricted mice were low in both strains and not significantly different from each other (experiment C). Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21) 7The abbreviation used is:FGF-21fibroblast growth factor-21. is a polypeptide hormone whose production is strongly induced in mouse liver after a 24-h fast (24.Potthoff M.J.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10853-10858Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). However, at 5:30 p.m. after 7 days of calorie restriction and 23.5 h of fasting, FGF-21 levels were actually low in both WT and Goat−/− mice (0.07 ± 0.04 versus 0.09 ± 0.04 ng/ml, respectively; n = 6). In the same experiment, non-calorie-restricted WT and Goat−/− mice fasted for 18 h showed high levels of FGF-21 (2.8 ± 0.48 versus 3.1 ± 0.61 ng/ml, respectively; n = 6). The similarly low levels of FGF-21 in the calorie-restricted WT and Goat−/− mice indicate that the low FGF-21 did not cause the hypoglycemia in the Goat−/− mice. fibroblast growth factor-21. Table 1 shows the plasma amino acid levels in calorie-restricted mice. At 5:30 p.m., the plasma levels of most amino acids were significantly higher in Goat−/− mice as compared with WT mice. This was particularly true of alanine, the key gluconeogenic amino acid (243 ± 89 μm in Goat−/− mice versus 72 ± 9 μm in WT mice). The levels of the branched chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, and leucine) were also much higher in Goat−/− mice. Elevation of branched chain amino acids is a hallmark of physiological states associated with increased protein catabolism as occurs in prolonged starvation (19.Ruderman N.B. Muscle amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis.Annu. Rev. Med. 1975; 26: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that hypoglycemia in Goat−/− mice is not caused by the lack of availability of amino acids.TABLE 1Plasma amino acid levels of WT and Goat−/− mice at 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. on day 7 of calorie restrictionAmino acid9:00 a.m.5:30 p.m.WTGoat−/−WTGoat−/−μmμmGly127 ± 13120 ± 1793 ± 14141 ± 33Ala137 ± 15157 ± 5172 ± 9.2243 ± 89ap < 0.05.Ser58 ± 5.052 ± 7.544 ± 5.6107 ± 30ap < 0.05.Thr70 ± 3.567 ± 9.160 ± 7.2182 ± 46ap < 0.05.Cys11 ± 1.010 ± 2.24.2 ± 1.47.2 ± 1.2Met16 ± 0.813 ± 1.311 ± 2.527 ± 8.0Val98 ± 9.391 ± 8.7104 ± 27400 ± 100bp < 0.01.Iso38 ± 5.332 ± 2.031 ± 6.756 ± 10ap < 0.05.Leu124 ± 1594 ± 1487 ± 42554 ± 147bp < 0.01.Asn————Gln202 ± 10183 ± 20173 ± 17279 ± 54Tyr126 ± 4.9130 ± 7.8122 ± 14181 ± 30Phe42 ± 2.830 ± 3.337 ± 3.555 ± 9.9Trp4.6 ± 1.36.1 ± 1.08.8 ± 2.012.1 ± 1.0Lys172 ± 6.2144 ± 17101 ± 25508 ± 152ap < 0.05.His20 ± 0.915 ± 3.618 ± 3.170 ± 24ap < 0.05.Arg41 ± 4.622 ± 3.420 ± 5.537 ± 8.1ap < 0.05.Asp1.7 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.23.7 ± 0.73.5 ± 0.9Glu12 ± 1.913 ± 1.59.1 ± 1.815 ± 3.6Pro179 ± 21142 ± 23214 ± 86275 ± 93a p < 0.05.b p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab To determine whether hypoglycemia in Goat−/− mice could be reversed by restoring plasma lactate and pyruvate, we subjected the animals to calorie restriction and then injected them intraperitoneally with these substances or with a saline control solution at hourly intervals (Fig. 4). Either lactate or pyruvate raised the blood sugar concentration in WT and Goat−/− mice (Fig. 4, A–D). In the Goat−/− animals, the injections were sufficient to prevent hypoglycemia. Alanine is readily converted to pyruvate and then to glucose (3.Cahill Jr., G.F. Fuel metabolism in starvation.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2006; 26: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 19.Ruderman N.B. Muscle amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis.Annu. Rev. Med. 1975; 26: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Unlike lactate or pyruvate, alanine did not raise the blood sugar in WT mice, but it did prevent hypoglycemia in the Goat−/− animals (Fig. 4, E and F). A notable feature of the calorie-restricted mice is the extremely low concentration of free fatty acids that develops in both strains in the afternoon (Fig. 3D). Despite this deficiency, WT mice are able to maintain their blood glucose, whereas Goat−/− mice become hypoglycemic. Fatty acids cannot be converted directly to glucose, but they can supply energy for glucose production (25.Williamson J.R. Kreisberg R.A. Felts P.W. Mechanism for the stimulation of gluconeogenesis by fatty acids in perfused rat liver.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1966; 56: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To determine whether administration of fatty acids could correct the hypoglycemia in Goat−/− mice, we injected calorie-restricted mice with octanoate. We chose octanoate because it is water-soluble and easier to deliver than are long chain fatty acids. Fig. 5 shows that two intraperitoneal injections of octanoate at 2 and 4 p.m. prevented the drop in blood sugar in the calorie-restricted Goat−/− mice. The plasma ghrelin concentration remained undetectable in the Goat−/− mice injected with octanoate. To confirm that the deficiency of fatty acids is responsible for the hypoglycemia in calorie restricted Goat−/− mice, we pretreated a group of mice with a high fat diet for 4 weeks to increase their adipose tissue stores prior to beginning calorie restriction. After the high fat diet, the body weights of the WT and Goat−/− mice increased by an average of 2.8 and 5.1 g, respectively. All of the mice were then switched to a diet composed of 1.4 g of chow, which was the average amount fed to our previous calorie-restricted mice (day 0 in Fig. 6). In the previously chow-fed WT and Goat−/− mice, the percentage of body fat declined below 2% after 5 days of calorie restriction. After the high fat feeding, body fat did not fall below the 2% threshold until 12 days of calorie restriction (Fig. 6, A and B). Likewise, the fall in plasma free fatty acids was also markedly delayed in the fat-fed mice of both strains, reaching the nadir of 0.4 mm after 7 and 14 days in the chow-fed and fat-fed mice, respectively (Fig. 6, C and D). The fall in plasma β-hydroxybutyrate was also delayed in the previously fat-fed mice as compared with the previously chow-fed mice (Fig. 6, E and F). Blood glucose in the previously chow-fed Goat−/− mice fell below 40 mg/dl at day 6, and the animals were moribund at day 8 (Fig. 6H). In contrast, the previously fat-fed Goat−/− mice appeared healthy up until day 12 when their blood glucose fell below 40 mg/dl (arrows in Fig. 6H), and they survived until day 14.

https://openalex.org/W2026674570,"Large conductance, Ca(2+)- and voltage-gated K(+) (BK) channel proteins are ubiquitously expressed in cell membranes and control a wide variety of biological processes. Membrane cholesterol regulates the activity of membrane-associated proteins, including BK channels. Cholesterol modulation of BK channels alters action potential firing, colonic ion transport, smooth muscle contractility, endothelial function, and the channel alcohol response. The structural bases underlying cholesterol-BK channel interaction are unknown. Such interaction is determined by strict chemical requirements for the sterol molecule, suggesting cholesterol recognition by a protein surface. Here, we demonstrate that cholesterol action on BK channel-forming Cbv1 proteins is mediated by their cytosolic C tail domain, where we identified seven cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus motifs (CRAC4 to 10), a distinct feature of BK proteins. Cholesterol sensitivity is provided by the membrane-adjacent CRAC4, where Val-444, Tyr-450, and Lys-453 are required for cholesterol sensing, with hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions participating in cholesterol location and recognition. However, cumulative truncations or Tyr-to-Phe substitutions in CRAC5 to 10 progressively blunt cholesterol sensitivity, documenting involvement of multiple CRACs in cholesterol-BK channel interaction. In conclusion, our study provides for the first time the structural bases of BK channel cholesterol sensitivity; the presence of membrane-adjacent CRAC4 and the long cytosolic C tail domain with several other CRAC motifs, which are not found in other members of the TM6 superfamily of ion channels, very likely explains the unique cholesterol sensitivity of BK channels."

The current study aimed to determine whether interference suppression and response inhibition are separable component processes of cognitive control. Methodology/Principal Findings Fourteen young adults completed a hybrid Go/Nogo flanker task and continuous EEG data were recorded concurrently. The incongruous flanker condition (that required interference suppression) elicited a more centrally distributed topography with a later N2 peak than the Nogo condition (that required response inhibition). Conclusions/Significance These results provide evidence for the dissociability of interference suppression and response inhibition, indicating that taxonomy of inhibition is warranted with the integration of research evidence from neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W2050664954,"Background Bursicon is a heterodimer neuropeptide composed of two cystine knot proteins, bursicon α (burs α) and bursicon β (burs β), that elicits cuticle tanning (melanization and sclerotization) through the Drosophila leucine-rich repeats-containing G protein-coupled receptor 2 (DLGR2). Recent studies show that both bursicon subunits also form homodimers. However, biological functions of the homodimers have remained unknown until now. Methodology/Principal Findings In this report, we show in Drosophila melanogaster that both bursicon homodimers induced expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in neck-ligated adults following recombinant homodimer injection and in larvae fat body after incubation with recombinant homodimers. These AMP genes were also up-regulated in 24 h old unligated flies (when the endogenous bursicon level is low) after injection of recombinant homodimers. Up-regulation of AMP genes by the homodimers was accompanied by reduced bacterial populations in fly assay preparations. The induction of AMP expression is via activation of the NF-κB transcription factor Relish in the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway. The influence of bursicon homodimers on immune function does not appear to act through the heterodimer receptor DLGR2, i.e. novel receptors exist for the homodimers. Conclusions/Significance Our results reveal a mechanism of CNS-regulated prophylactic innate immunity during molting via induced expression of genes encoding AMPs and genes of the Turandot family. Turandot genes are also up-regulated by a broader range of extreme insults. From these data we infer that CNS-generated bursicon homodimers mediate innate prophylactic immunity to both stress and infection during the vulnerable molting cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2061957332,"Over the past 50 years, repeated attempts have been made to develop biological control technologies for use against economically important species of subterranean termites, focusing primarily on the use of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. However, no successful field implementation of biological control has been reported. Most previous work has been conducted under the assumption that environmental conditions within termite nests would favor the growth and dispersion of entomopathogenic agents, resulting in an epizootic. Epizootics rely on the ability of the pathogenic microorganism to self-replicate and disperse among the host population. However, our study shows that due to multilevel disease resistance mechanisms, the incidence of an epizootic within a group of termites is unlikely. By exposing groups of 50 termites in planar arenas containing sand particles treated with a range of densities of an entomopathogenic fungus, we were able to quantify behavioral patterns as a function of the death ratios resulting from the fungal exposure. The inability of the fungal pathogen M. anisopliae to complete its life cycle within a Coptotermes formosanus (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) group was mainly the result of cannibalism and the burial behavior of the nest mates, even when termite mortality reached up to 75%. Because a subterranean termite colony, as a superorganism, can prevent epizootics of M. anisopliae, the traditional concepts of epizootiology may not apply to this social insect when exposed to fungal pathogens, or other pathogen for which termites have evolved behavioral and physiological means of disrupting their life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1975907226,"Infiltrated macrophages may play important roles in the development and progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We found increased macrophages infiltration in human and mouse BPH tissues. By establishing a co-culture transwell system, we found increased migration of macrophages and proliferation of prostate stromal cells during co-culture. Importantly, stromal androgen receptor (AR) could enhance the migration of macrophages and macrophage-mediated stromal cell proliferation. We identified CCL3 as an AR downstream player, and found CCL3 levels were notably increased in human and mouse BPH prostates. Ablation of prostate stromal AR in a mouse BPH model significantly reduced CCL3 expression levels in prostates. Consistently, targeting AR via an AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9®, or neutralization of CCL3 with an antibody, resulted in suppression of macrophage migration and prostate stromal cell growth. Our study provides mechanistic insights on the regulation of prostate stromal cells by macrophages via stromal AR/CCL3 signaling pathways, which could potentially allow the development of therapeutic approaches for battling BPH with persistent inflammation."

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Specific primers used for RT-PCR assays were 5′-ACTCCTGGTACAGCGACTCCGAAATCCT-3′ (sense), 5′-GTCCCTGCACTGTTGTCCTTTGCTCATA-3′ (antisense) for Smurf1, and 5′-CAACTACATGGTCTACATGTTC-3′ (sense), 5′-CACCAGTAGACTCCACGAC-3′ (antisense) for GAPDH. Specific primers for Cxcl9, Cxcl10, IRF1, and iNOS were used as described (19.Liu B. Mink S. Wong K.A. Stein N. Getman C. Dempsey P.W. Wu H. Shuai K. PIAS1 selectively inhibits interferon-inducible genes and is important in innate immunity.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To detect interaction between endogenous Smurf1 and STAT1, whole-cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Merck). After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g, supernatants were collected and incubated with protein G Plus-agarose immunoprecipitation reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) together with anti-Smurf1 antibody. After 6 h of incubation, beads were washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling with 1% (w/v) SDS sample buffer. To detect interaction between exogenous Smurf1 and STAT1, lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with STAT1 or its mutants and Smurf1 or its mutants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for 3 h. After washing three times with TBS buffer, immunoprecipitates were separated from the beads by adding 3×FLAG peptide elution solution and then boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting analysis, immunoprecipitates or whole-cell lysates were loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and then blotted as described previously (16.Zhao W. Wang L. Zhang L. Yuan C. Kuo P.C. Gao C. Differential expression of intracellular and secreted osteopontin isoforms by murine macrophages in response to Toll-like receptor agonists.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20452-20461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) as described. Data were normalized for transfection efficiency by division of firefly luciferase activity with that of Renilla luciferase. To measure STAT1 ubiquitination in vivo, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-ubiquitin (HA-Ub), FLAG-STAT1, Myc-Smurf1 wild-type (WT), and Myc-Smurf1 E3-inactive mutant (C699A, CA), as indicated. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested under denaturing conditions in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1% SDS. Samples were boiled for 5 min and then diluted 10-fold with buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Merck). Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Cell lysates were then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for 3 h. After washing three times with TBS buffer, immunoprecipitates were separated from the beads by adding 3×FLAG peptide elution solution and then boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was subsequently performed using the indicated antibodies. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) plaque assay was performed as described (20.Mao A.P. Li S. Zhong B. Li Y. Yan J. Li Q. Teng C. Shu H.B. Virus-triggered ubiquitination of TRAF3/6 by cIAP1/2 is essential for induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) and cellular antiviral response.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9470-9476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The HEK293 cells (2 × 105) were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h following treatment with recombinant human IFN-γ (10 ng/ml) for 8 h. At 1 h after VSV infection, cells were washed with PBS for three times, and then medium was added. The supernatants were harvested at 24 h after washing. The supernatants were diluted from 1:103 to 1:106 and then used to infect confluent HEK293 cells cultured on 24-well plates. At 1 h after infection, the supernatant was removed, and 1% methylcellulose was overlaid. At 2 days after infection, overlay was removed; cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Plaques were counted, averaged, and multiplied by the dilution factor to determine viral titer as pfu/ml. Total HEK293 cellular RNA was extracted at 18 h after VSV infection, and VSV RNA replicates were examined by quantitative RT-PCR as described (21.Zheng Y. An H. Yao M. Hou J. Yu Y. Feng G. Cao X. Scaffolding adaptor protein Gab1 is required for TLR3/4- and RIG-I-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFN in macrophages.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 6447-6456Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Primers for VSV were as follows: 5′-ACGGCGTACTTCCAGATGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCGGTTCAAGATCCAGGT-3′ (antisense). All data are presented as mean ± S.D. of three or four experiments. Statistical significance was determined with the two-tailed Student's t test, with a p value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Smurf1 plays a critical role in the regulation of TGF-β signaling and BMP signaling by targeting the degradation of several target proteins (22.Xing L. Zhang M. Chen D. Smurf control in bone cells.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 110: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To explore the functions of Smurf1 in other signaling pathways, we initially investigated the effect of Smurf1 on interferon signaling. The binding of IFN-γ to its receptor, interferon-γ receptor (IFNGR), results in the phosphorylation of STAT1 and formation of STAT1 homodimers named γ-interferon activation factor (GAF). γ-Interferon activation factor migrates to the nucleus and binds to a DNA element termed IFN-γ-activated site (GAS), resulting in the activation of transcription and induction of STAT1 target genes (23.Eilers A. Georgellis D. Klose B. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Decker T. Differentiation-regulated serine phosphorylation of STAT1 promotes GAF activation in macrophages.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3579-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Smurf1 in IFN-γ signaling, the effect of Smurf1 on the activation of the STAT1 cis-reporting plasmid GAS-Luc was investigated. As shown in Fig. 1A, overexpression of Smurf1 significantly inhibited IFN-γ-induced transcriptional activation of GAS-Luc reporter plasmids. Furthermore, Smurf1 inhibited IFN-γ-induced activation of GAS-Luc reporter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Similarly, Smurf1 also significantly inhibited IFN-γ-induced transcriptional activation of iNOS gene promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). To directly examine the function of Smurf1 in IFN-γ-mediated gene activation, mouse peritoneal macrophages were transfected with control siRNA or Smurf1 siRNA to silence Smurf1 expression, and then the cells were treated with IFN-γ for various times. Both Smurf1 mRNA and protein were substantially decreased after transfection of Smurf1 siRNA when compared with control siRNA transfection (Fig. 1D). IFN-γ-induced expression of Cxcl9 (CXC chemokine ligand 9), Cxcl10 (CXC chemokine ligand 10), Irf1 (interferon regulatory factor 1), and Nos2 (inducible nitric oxide synthase) was significantly enhanced in Smurf1 siRNA-transfected macrophages as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 1E). Similarly, IFN-β-induced expression of Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Ly6e, and Ifi203 was also significantly enhanced in Smurf1 siRNA-transfected macrophages (Fig. 1F). Accordingly, IFN-γ-induced NO production was significantly increased in Smurf1 siRNA-transfected macrophages (Fig. 1G). Altogether, these results suggest that Smurf1 negatively regulates IFN signaling. STAT1 plays an essential role in IFN-γ signaling. Furthermore, STAT1 has been reported to interact with Smurf1 in a large scale luminescence-based mammalian interactome mapping (24.Barrios-Rodiles M. Brown K.R. Ozdamar B. Bose R. Liu Z. Donovan R.S. Shinjo F. Liu Y. Dembowy J. Taylor I.W. Luga V. Przulj N. Robinson M. Suzuki H. Hayashizaki Y. Jurisica I. Wrana J.L. High-throughput mapping of a dynamic signaling network in mammalian cells.Science. 2005; 307: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that Smurf1 negatively regulates IFN-γ signaling by targeting STAT1. To confirm the interaction between Smurf1 and STAT1, Myc-Smurf1 and FLAG-STAT1 were cotransfected into HEK293 cells followed by coimmunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody and Western blotting with Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, Myc-smurf1 was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-STAT1. Similarly, Myc-STAT1 could be coimmunoprecipitated by FLAG-Smurf1 (Fig. 2B). Myc-STAT1 was also coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-Smurf1 CA mutant (Fig. 2B), indicating that Smurf1 interacts with STAT1 independent of its E3 ligase activity. Interaction of endogenous proteins was confirmed in macrophages stimulated with IFN-γ for various times with coimmunoprecipitation assays and Western blotting. STAT1 was coimmunoprecipitated with Smurf1 in both IFN-γ-simulated and unstimulated conditions (Fig. 2C). As a control, the interaction could not be detected with normal IgG. It has been reported that Smuf1 interacts with its target proteins through the WW domains of Smurf1 and the proline-rich (PPXY) motif in the substrate proteins (25.Chong P.A. Lin H. Wrana J.L. Forman-Kay J.D. Coupling of tandem Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor (Smurf) WW domains modulates target specificity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18404-18409Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To map the Smuf1 domains required for the interaction with STAT1, various Smurf1 mutants were cotransfected into HEK293 cells with STAT1 followed by coimmunoprecipitation. Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that the WW domains but not the C2 or HECT domains of Smurf1 mediated the interaction with STAT1 (Fig. 2D). Sequence analysis showed that there is a putative PY motif (PLKY amino acids from 663 to 666) in STAT1, which is conserved among STAT1 proteins from various species. To determine whether the PY motif of STAT1 is required for the interaction with Smurf1, the PLKY motif was mutated into ALKA (STAT1 PY/AA). In contrast to WT STAT1, STAT1 PY/AA lost the ability to interact with Smurf1 as measured with coimmunoprecipitation assays, suggesting that the PY motif is required for the interaction with Smurf1 (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these data indicate that Smurf1 interacts with STAT1 through the WW domains of Smurf1 and the PY motif of STAT1. Smurf1 is an E3 ligase and mediates the degradation of target proteins (1.Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. A SMAD ubiquitin ligase targets the BMP pathway and affects embryonic pattern formation.Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The interaction between Smurf1 and STAT1 prompted us to investigate the function of Smurf1 on the degradation of STAT1. An increasing concentration of Smurf1 expression plasmid was cotransfected into HEK293 cells together with a constant concentration of STAT1 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3A, STAT1 protein expression was substantially decreased with transfection of Smurf1 expression plasmid. In sharp contrast, Smurf1 CA mutant could not decrease the STAT1 protein level, indicating that the E3 ligase activity of Smurf1 is required for the degradation of STAT1. Similarly, Smurf1 transfection could decrease the level of endogenous STAT1 protein (Fig. 3B). To determine whether Smurf1 inhibits STAT1 protein expression under physiological conditions, Smurf1 siRNA was transfected into mouse primary peritoneal macrophages, and STAT1 protein expression was measured. Transfection of Smurf1 siRNA significantly increased total STAT1 protein level in macrophages when compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, IFN-γ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation was also significantly increased (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that Smurf1 promotes the degradation of STAT1. Because Smurf1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and causes STAT1 degradation, STAT1 ubiquitination mediated by Smurf1 was investigated. Expression plasmids for FLAG-STAT1 and HA-ubiquitin were transfected into HEK293 cells together with Myc-Smurf1, Myc-Smurf1 CA, or control plasmid followed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of STAT1 ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 4A, STAT1 polyubiquitination was greatly increased in the presence of Smurf1 (lane 3) when compared with control vector (lane 2). Importantly, transfection of Smurf1 CA mutant could not increase STAT1 polyubiquitination (lane 4). To determine the form of ubiquitin chains linked to STAT1, ubiquitin mutant vectors K48 and K63, were used in transfection assays. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis showed that Smurf1 induced K48-linked polyubiquitination of STAT1 (lanes 2 and 4), but not K63-linked polyubiquitination (Fig. 4B, lane 6). K48-linked protein ubiquitination leads to the degradation of the corresponding protein by 26 S proteasome (26.Pickart C.M. Mechanisms underlying ubiquitination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar). Consistently, Smurf1-induced degradation of STAT1 protein could be reversed by proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results indicate that Smurf1 promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of STAT1. Because STAT1 must be phosphorylated on tyrosine 701 and serine 727 to be fully active in transcription (27.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Maximal activation of transcription by Stat1 and Stat3 requires both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation.Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar), we investigated whether STAT1 degradation mediated by Smurf1 requires phosphorylation. Expression plasmids for STAT1 wild-type or mutants (Y701F or S727A) were transfected into HEK293 together with increasing amounts of Smurf1, and the level of STAT1 proteins was measured with Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5A, Smurf1 could induce the degradation of STAT1 WT and STAT1 mutants Y701F and S727A. Consistently, Smurf1 could promote polyubiquitination of both STAT1 WT and STAT1 mutants Y701F and S727A (Fig. 5B). These data indicated that the degradation of STAT1 mediated by Smurf1 is independent of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation. Previous studies showed that full complementation of the antiviral state requires full-length STAT1 (28.Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. The antiviral state induced by α-interferon and γ-interferon requires transcriptionally active Stat1 protein.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 647-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Smurf1 is a physiological suppressor of IFN-γ signaling, we speculate that Smurf1 may play a role in the cellular antiviral response. To directly investigate the effect of Smurf1 on IFN-γ-mediated antiviral responses, VSV was used to infect HEK293 cells and macrophages. Plaque assay of HEK293 cells infected with VSV showed that overexpression of Smurf1 substantially increased viral replication (Fig. 6A). In sharp contrast, Smurf1 CA mutant, which lost the ability to promote ubiquitination and degradation of STAT1, could not increase viral replication (Fig. 6A). Similarly, VSV RNA replication in HEK293 cells was significantly increased in Smurf1-transfected cells when compared with control vector- or Smurf1 CA-transfected cells as measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6B). To further confirm the function of Smurf1 on VSV replication under physiological conditions, Smurf1 expression was silenced by Smurf1 siRNA transfection in mouse peritoneal macrophages, and then the macrophages were stimulated with IFN-γ and infected with VSV. Plaque assay showed that transfection of Smurf1 siRNA greatly decreased VSV viral replication in macrophages (Fig. 6C). Accordingly, knockdown of Smurf1 significantly decreased intracellular VSV RNA replication when compared with control siRNA-transfected macrophages (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Smurf1 negatively regulates cellular antiviral immune responses. Having established the negative role of Smurf1 in IFN-γ signaling, we finally examined the effect of IFN-γ on Smurf1 expression. RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with IFN-γ for various times, and the level of Smurf1 protein was analyzed with immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 7A, the expression level of Smurf1 protein was significantly increased and reached peak expression at 8–24 h after IFN-γ stimulation. Surprisingly, IFN-β could not induce Smurf1 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages (Fig. 7B). Smurf1 protein expression was also induced with IFN-γ stimulation in NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells (Fig. 7, C and D). These results suggest that Smurf1 is induced by IFN-γ and acts as a negative feedback regulator for IFN-γ signaling. Interferons have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunoregulatory functions (9.van Boxel-Dezaire A.H. Rani M.R. Stark G.R. Complex modulation of cell type-specific signaling in response to type I interferons.Immunity. 2006; 25: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 10.Schroder K. Hertzog P.J. Ravasi T. Hume D.A. Interferon-γ: an overview of signals, mechanisms, and functions.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar). However, uncontrolled IFN signaling may lead to autoimmune diseases (29.Schindler C.W. Series introduction: JAK-STAT signaling in human disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, IFN signaling must be tightly controlled. As an essential molecule downstream of IFN signaling, the importance of STAT1 has been manifested by the construction of STAT1-deficient mice (12.Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Campbell D. Carver-Moore K. DuBois R.N. Clark R. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Targeted disruption of the Stat1 gene in mice reveals unexpected physiologic specificity in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.Cell. 1996; 84: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of STAT1 activation represents a novel pathway to modulate IFN signaling. In this study, we demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 promotes STAT1 ubiquitination and degradation to negatively regulate interferon-γ signaling. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, Smurf1 was found to interact with STAT1. Like most interactions between Smurf1 and its substrate, domain-mapping experiments suggest that the WW domains of Smurf1 are sufficient for its interaction with STAT1. The PY motif in STAT1 directly mediated the interaction with Smurf1. Furthermore, we found that Smurf1 promotes STAT1 ubiquitination and degradation through a proteasome-dependent manner. Consequently, Smurf1 overexpression significantly decreased IFN-γ signaling and antiviral immune responses, whereas knockdown of Smurf1 expression increased STAT1 phosphorylation, expression of STAT1 target genes, and antiviral immune responses. Importantly, Smurf1 expression is induced by IFN-γ stimulation in several types of cell. Thus, Smurf1 is a negative feedback regulator for IFN-γ signaling by targeting STAT1 ubiquitination and degradation. Previous studies have demonstrated that ubiquitination and degradation of STAT1 are an important mechanism to down-regulate IFN signaling. Kim and Maniatis (30.Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Regulation of interferon-γ-activated STAT1 by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) were the first to report STAT1 ubiquitination. They found that STAT1 proteins activated by interferon-γ were stabilized by a proteasome inhibitor MG132. Further, they showed that STAT1 was ubiquitinated upon IFN-γ stimulation and that STAT1 phosphorylation was required for its ubiquitination. STAT1 ubiquitination was also detected during virus infection. Some viruses, including SV5 and mumps virus, use their V protein to block IFN signaling by targeting STAT1 for ubiquitination and proteasome mediated degradation (31.Kubota T. Yokosawa N. Yokota S. Fujii N. Tashiro M. Kato A. Mumps virus V protein antagonizes interferon without the complete degradation of STAT1.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4451-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32.Didcock L. Young D.F. Goodbourn S. Randall R.E. The V protein of simian virus 5 inhibits interferon signaling by targeting STAT1 for proteasome-mediated degradation.J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9928-9933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the E3 ligases responsible for the STAT1 ubiquitination are not defined. In this regard, PDLIM2 has been identified as an E3 ligase for STAT1 ubiquitination (15.Tanaka T. Soriano M.A. Grusby M.J. SLIM is a nuclear ubiquitin E3 ligase that negatively regulates STAT signaling.Immunity. 2005; 22: 729-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17.Gao C. Guo H. Mi Z. Grusby M.J. Kuo P.C. Osteopontin induces ubiquitin-dependent degradation of STAT1 in RAW264.7 murine macrophages.J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PDLIM2, as a nuclear protein, was shown to specifically interact with the tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and mediates the degradation of active STAT1. In this study, we demonstrated that Smurf1 is another E3 ligase involved in STAT1 ubiquitination and degradation. Importantly, we found that STAT1 constitutively interacts with Smurf1 in the cytoplasm. STAT1 Y701F and S727A mutants could be ubiquitinated and degraded by Smurf1 with the same efficiency as the WT STAT1. Thus, our findings suggest that Smurf1 is a cellular ubiquitin ligase with specificity toward unphosphorylated STAT1 proteins. Smurf1 plays essential roles in development (22.Xing L. Zhang M. Chen D. Smurf control in bone cells.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 110: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The possible role of the Smurf1 protein in immunity has been reported recently. Smurf1 was demonstrated to mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of MyD88, an essential adaptor molecule in Toll-like receptor and IL-1 signaling (8.Lee Y.S. Park J.S. Kim J.H. Jung S.M. Lee J.Y. Kim S.J. Park S.H. Smad6-specific recruitment of Smurf E3 ligases mediates TGF-β1-induced degradation of MyD88 in TLR4 signaling.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 460Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Smurf1 has also been reported to target various TRAF family proteins (7.Li S. Lu K. Wang J. An L. Yang G. Chen H. Cui Y. Yin X. Xie P. Xing G. He F. Zhang L. Ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 targets TRAF family proteins for ubiquitination and degradation.Mol. Cell Biochem. 2010; 338: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Given the importance of TRAF family proteins in immunity, these data indicate that Smurf1 plays an important role in immune responses. We provided evidence to show that Smurf1 negatively regulates IFN signaling by targeting STAT1 ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, Smurf1 is a very important immune regulator through promoting degradation of various target proteins. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 mediated the ubiquitination and degradation of unphosphorylated STAT1 to negatively regulate IFN-γ signaling. Overexpression of Smurf1 attenuated IFN-γ-mediated STAT1 activation and antiviral immune responses, whereas knockdown of Smurf1 greatly increased IFN-γ-induced STAT1 activation, expression of STAT1 target genes, and antiviral immune responses. Thus, Smurf1 may be a valuable target for the design of therapeutic drugs to modulate IFN signaling that are involved in antiviral immunity and autoimmune diseases. We thank Drs. Jeffrey L.

https://openalex.org/W2083010238,"Stretch of the vascular wall is an important stimulus to maintain smooth muscle contractile differentiation that is known to depend on L-type calcium influx, Rho-activation, and actin polymerization. The role of microRNAs in this response was investigated using tamoxifen-inducible and smooth muscle-specific Dicer KO mice. In the absence of Dicer, which is required for microRNA maturation, smooth muscle microRNAs were completely ablated. Stretch-induced contractile differentiation and Rho-dependent cofilin-2 phosphorylation were dramatically reduced in Dicer KO vessels. On the other hand, acute stretch-sensitive growth signaling, which is independent of influx through L-type calcium channels, was not affected by Dicer KO. Contractile differentiation induced by the actin polymerizing agent jasplakinolide was not altered by deletion of Dicer, suggesting an effect upstream of actin polymerization. Basal and stretch-induced L-type calcium channel expressions were both decreased in Dicer KO portal veins, and inhibition of L-type channels in control vessels mimicked the effects of Dicer deletion. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-145, a highly expressed microRNA in smooth muscle, resulted in a similar reduction of L-type calcium channel expression. This was abolished by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN93, suggesting that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIδ, a target of miR-145 and up-regulated in Dicer KO, plays a role in the regulation of L-type channel expression. These results show that microRNAs play a crucial role in stretch-induced contractile differentiation in the vascular wall in part via miR-145-dependent regulation of L-type calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W2091628243,"Conserved uncharacterized genes account for ~30% of genes in both eukaryotic and bacterial genomes and are predicted to encode what are often termed ""conserved hypothetical proteins."" Many of these proteins have a wide phylogenetic distribution and might play important roles in conserved cellular pathways. Using the bacterium Serratia as a model system, we have investigated two conserved uncharacterized proteins, YgfY (a DUF339 protein, renamed SdhE; succinate dehydrogenase protein E) and YgfX (a DUF1434 protein). SdhE was required for growth on succinate as a sole carbon source and for the function, but not stability, of succinate dehydrogenase, an important component of the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. SdhE interacted with the flavoprotein SdhA, directly bound the flavin adenine dinucleotide co-factor, and was required for the flavinylation of SdhA. This is the first demonstration of a protein required for FAD incorporation in bacteria. Furthermore, the loss of SdhE was highly pleiotropic, suggesting that SdhE might flavinylate other flavoproteins. Our findings are of wide importance to central metabolism because SdhE homologues are present in α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria and multiple eukaryotes, including humans and yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2144276081,"FOXO3a, a member of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor family, is believed to be a tumor suppressor because it was found that FOXO3a inactivation promoted cell transformation and tumor progression. There are also a few studies showing that FOXO3a protected cells under stress conditions, including oxidative stress, serum deprivation, and hypoxia. It was reported that FOXO3a promoted invasion of cancer cells. Thus, the role of FOXO3a in cancer is complicated. Here, we report that FOXO3a is a positive regulator of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. We found that overexpression of FOXO3a increased and knockdown of FOXO3a repressed NF-κB activities. Mechanistic studies indicate that FOXO3a activated NF-κB via inducing expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10), an upstream regulator of IκB kinase (IKK)/NF-κB signaling. We found that the serum deprivation activated NF-κB, which was blocked by inhibition of FOXO3a. Knockdown of FOXO3a enhanced cell apoptosis under serum-free conditions, which was inhibited by overexpression of BCL10. These results suggest that FOXO3a promotes cell survival via BCL10/NF-κB in serum starvation. Our findings may add another layer to the complexity of the role of FOXO3a in cancer. Therefore, caution should be taken when FOXO3a is employed as a target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1977726947,"Crystal structures of Gloeobacter violaceus ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC), a proton-gated prokaryotic homologue of pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (LGIC) from G. violaceus, have provided high-resolution models of the channel architecture and its role in selective ion conduction and drug binding. However, it is still unclear which functional states of the LGIC gating scheme these crystal structures represent. Much of this uncertainty arises from a lack of thorough understanding of the functional properties of these prokaryotic channels. To elucidate the molecular events that constitute gating, we have carried out an extensive characterization of GLIC function and dynamics in reconstituted proteoliposomes by patch clamp measurements and EPR spectroscopy. We find that GLIC channels show rapid activation upon jumps to acidic pH followed by a time-dependent loss of conductance because of desensitization. GLIC desensitization is strongly coupled to activation and is modulated by voltage, permeant ions, pore-blocking drugs, and membrane cholesterol. Many of these properties are parallel to functions observed in members of eukaryotic LGIC. Conformational changes in loop C, measured by site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy, reveal immobilization during desensitization analogous to changes in LGIC and acetylcholine binding protein. Together, our studies suggest conservation of mechanistic aspects of desensitization among LGICs of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin."
https://openalex.org/W2074458472,"Ommochromes are one of the major pigments involved in coloration of eggs, eyes, and body surface of insects. However, the molecular mechanisms of the final steps of ommochrome pigment synthesis have been largely unknown. The eggs of the silkworm Bombyx mori contain a mixture of ommochrome pigments, and exhibit a brownish lilac color. The recessive homozygous of egg and eye color mutant, red egg (re), whose eggs display a pale orange color instead of normal dark coloration, has been long suggested to have a defect in the biosynthesis of the final ommochrome pigments. Here, we identify the gene responsible for the re locus by positional cloning, mutant analysis, and RNAi experiments. In the re mutants, we found that a 541-bp transposable element is inserted into the ORF of BGIBMGA003497-1 (Bm-re) encoding a novel member of a major facilitator superfamily transporter, causing disruption of the splicing of exon 9, resulting in two aberrant transcripts with frameshifts yielding nonfunctional proteins lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domains. Bm-re function in pigmentation was confirmed by embryonic RNAi experiments. Homologs of the Bm-re gene were found in all insect genomes sequenced at present, except for 12 sequenced Drosophila genomes, which seemed to correlate with the previous studies that have demonstrated that eye ommochrome composition is different from other insects in several Dipterans. Knockdown of the Bm-re homolog by RNAi in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum caused adult compound eye coloration defects, indicating a conserved role in ommochrome pigment biosynthesis at least among holometabolous insects. Ommochromes are one of the major pigments involved in coloration of eggs, eyes, and body surface of insects. However, the molecular mechanisms of the final steps of ommochrome pigment synthesis have been largely unknown. The eggs of the silkworm Bombyx mori contain a mixture of ommochrome pigments, and exhibit a brownish lilac color.

https://openalex.org/W1990518231,"The control architecture underlying human reaching has been established, at least in broad outline. However, despite extensive research, the control architecture underlying human locomotion remains unclear. Some studies show evidence of high-level control focused on lower-limb trajectories; others suggest that nonlinear oscillators such as lower-level rhythmic central pattern generators (CPGs) play a significant role. To resolve this ambiguity, we reasoned that if a nonlinear oscillator contributes to locomotor control, human walking should exhibit dynamic entrainment to periodic mechanical perturbation; entrainment is a distinctive behavior of nonlinear oscillators. Here we present the first behavioral evidence that nonlinear neuro-mechanical oscillators contribute to the production of human walking, albeit weakly. As unimpaired human subjects walked at constant speed, we applied periodic torque pulses to the ankle at periods different from their preferred cadence. The gait period of 18 out of 19 subjects entrained to this mechanical perturbation, converging to match that of the perturbation. Significantly, entrainment occurred only if the perturbation period was close to subjects' preferred walking cadence: it exhibited a narrow basin of entrainment. Further, regardless of the phase within the walking cycle at which perturbation was initiated, subjects' gait synchronized or phase-locked with the mechanical perturbation at a phase of gait where it assisted propulsion. These results were affected neither by auditory feedback nor by a distractor task. However, the convergence to phase-locking was slow. These characteristics indicate that nonlinear neuro-mechanical oscillators make at most a modest contribution to human walking. Our results suggest that human locomotor control is not organized as in reaching to meet a predominantly kinematic specification, but is hierarchically organized with a semi-autonomous peripheral oscillator operating under episodic supervisory control."
https://openalex.org/W2039540543,"The desert is an excellent model for studying evolution under extreme environments. We present here the complete genome and ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced transcriptome of Deinococcus gobiensis I-0, which was isolated from the cold Gobi desert and shows higher tolerance to gamma radiation and UV light than all other known microorganisms. Nearly half of the genes in the genome encode proteins of unknown function, suggesting that the extreme resistance phenotype may be attributed to unknown genes and pathways. D. gobiensis also contains a surprisingly large number of horizontally acquired genes and predicted mobile elements of different classes, which is indicative of adaptation to extreme environments through genomic plasticity. High-resolution RNA-Seq transcriptome analyses indicated that 30 regulatory proteins, including several well-known regulators and uncharacterized protein kinases, and 13 noncoding RNAs were induced immediately after UV irradiation. Particularly interesting is the UV irradiation induction of the phrB and recB genes involved in photoreactivation and recombinational repair, respectively. These proteins likely include key players in the immediate global transcriptional response to UV irradiation. Our results help to explain the exceptional ability of D. gobiensis to withstand environmental extremes of the Gobi desert, and highlight the metabolic features of this organism that have biotechnological potential."
https://openalex.org/W2028218115,"Polycystin-2 (PC2) is a Ca(2+)-permeable transient receptor potential channel activated and regulated by changes in cytoplasmic Ca(2+). PC2 mutations are responsible for ∼15% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Although the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PC2 has been shown to contain a Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand domain, the molecular basis of PC2 channel gating by Ca(2+) remains unknown. We propose that the PC2 EF-hand is a Ca(2+) sensor required for channel gating. Consistent with this, Ca(2+) binding causes a dramatic decrease in the radius of gyration (R(g)) of the PC2 EF-hand by small angle x-ray scattering and significant conformational changes by NMR. Furthermore, increasing Ca(2+) concentrations cause the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail to transition from a mixture of extended oligomers to a single compact dimer by analytical ultracentrifugation, coupled with a >30 Å decrease in maximum interatomic distance (D(max)) by small angle x-ray scattering. Mutant PC2 channels unable to bind Ca(2+) via the EF-hand are inactive in single-channel planar lipid bilayers and inhibit Ca(2+) release from ER stores upon overexpression in cells, suggesting dominant negative properties. Our results support a model where PC2 channels are gated by discrete conformational changes in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail in response to changes in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels. These properties of PC2 are lost in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, emphasizing the importance of PC2 to kidney cell function. We speculate that PC2 and the Ca(2+)-dependent transient receptor potential channels in general are regulated by similar conformational changes in their cytoplasmic domains that are propagated to the channel pore."
https://openalex.org/W1965886912,"Influenza A virus (IAV) induces apoptosis of infected cells. In response to IAV infection, p53, a tumor suppressor involved in regulating apoptosis and host antiviral defense, accumulates and becomes activated. This study was undertaken to examine the mechanism of p53 accumulation in IAV-infected cells. Here we show that p53 accumulation in IAV-infected cells results from protein stabilization, which was associated with compromised Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. In IAV-infected cells, p53 was stabilized and its half-life was remarkably extended. The ladders of polyubiquitinated p53 were not detectable in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and were less sensitive to proteasome-mediated degradation. IAV infection did not affect the abundance of Mdm2, a major ubiquitin E3 ligase responsible for regulating p53 ubiquitination and degradation, but weakened the interaction between p53 and Mdm2. Viral nucleoprotein (NP) was able to increase the transcriptional activity and stability of p53. Furthermore, NP was found to associate with p53 and to impair the p53-Mdm2 interaction and Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, demonstrating its role in inhibiting Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2018032273,"Cell-cell junctions are an integral part of epithelia and are often disrupted in cancer cells during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a main driver of metastatic spread. We show here that Metastasis suppressor-1 (Mtss1; Missing in Metastasis, MIM), a member of the IMD-family of proteins, inhibits cell-cell junction disassembly in wound healing or HGF-induced scatter assays by enhancing cell-cell junction strength. Mtss1 not only makes cells more resistant to cell-cell junction disassembly, but also accelerates the kinetics of adherens junction assembly. Mtss1 drives enhanced junction formation specifically by elevating Rac-GTP. Lastly, we show that Mtss1 depletion reduces recruitment of F-actin at cell-cell junctions. We thus propose that Mtss1 promotes Rac1 activation and actin recruitment driving junction maintenance. We suggest that the observed loss of Mtss1 in cancers may compromise junction stability and thus promote EMT and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2151227595,"Zaragozic acids (ZAs) belong to a family of fungal metabolites with nanomolar inhibitory activity toward squalene synthase (SQS). The enzyme catalyzes the committed step of sterol synthesis and has attracted attention as a potential target for antilipogenic and antiinfective therapies. Here, we have determined the structure of ZA-A complexed with human SQS. ZA-A binding induces a local conformational change in the substrate binding site, and its C-6 acyl group also extends over to the cofactor binding cavity. In addition, ZA-A effectively inhibits a homologous bacterial enzyme, dehydrosqualene synthase (CrtM), which synthesizes the precursor of staphyloxanthin in Staphylococcus aureus to cope with oxidative stress. Size reduction at Tyr(248) in CrtM further increases the ZA-A binding affinity, and it reveals a similar overall inhibitor binding mode to that of human SQS/ZA-A except for the C-6 acyl group. These structures pave the way for further improving selectivity and development of a new generation of anticholesterolemic and antimicrobial inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2008808040,"Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are thiol-specific antioxidant proteins that protect cells against reactive oxygen species and are involved in cellular signaling pathways. Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase Ahp1 belongs to the Prx5 subfamily and is a two-cysteine (2-Cys) Prx that forms an intermolecular disulfide bond. Enzymatic assays and bioinformatics enabled us to re-assign the peroxidatic cysteine (C(P)) to Cys-62 and the resolving cysteine (C(R)) to Cys-31 but not the previously reported Cys-120. Thus Ahp1 represents the first 2-Cys Prx with a peroxidatic cysteine after the resolving cysteine in the primary sequence. We also found the positive cooperativity of the substrate t-butyl hydroperoxide binding to Ahp1 homodimer at a Hill coefficient of ∼2, which enabled Ahp1 to eliminate hydroperoxide at much higher efficiency. To gain the structural insights into the catalytic cycle of Ahp1, we determined the crystal structures of Ahp1 in the oxidized, reduced, and Trx2-complexed forms at 2.40, 2.91, and 2.10 Å resolution, respectively. Structural superposition of the oxidized to the reduced form revealed significant conformational changes at the segments containing C(P) and C(R). An intermolecular C(P)-C(R) disulfide bond crossing the A-type dimer interface distinguishes Ahp1 from other typical 2-Cys Prxs. The structure of the Ahp1-Trx2 complex showed for the first time how the electron transfers from thioredoxin to a peroxidase with a thioredoxin-like fold. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis in combination with enzymatic assays suggested that the peroxidase activity of Ahp1 would be altered upon the urmylation (covalently conjugated to ubiquitin-related modifier Urm1) of Lys-32."
https://openalex.org/W2076624411,"Enoxacin has been identified as a small molecule inhibitor of binding between the B2-subunit of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and microfilaments. It inhibits bone resorption by calcitriol-stimulated mouse marrow cultures. We hypothesized that enoxacin acts directly and specifically on osteoclasts by disrupting the interaction between plasma membrane-directed V-ATPases, which contain the osteoclast-selective a3-subunit of V-ATPase, and microfilaments. Consistent with this hypothesis, enoxacin dose-dependently reduced the number of multinuclear cells expressing tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity produced by RANK-L-stimulated osteoclast precursors. Enoxacin (50 μM) did not induce apoptosis as measured by TUNEL and caspase-3 assays. V-ATPases containing the a3-subunit, but not the ""housekeeping"" a1-subunit, were isolated bound to actin. Treatment with enoxacin reduced the association of V-ATPase subunits with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton. Quantitative PCR revealed that enoxacin triggered significant reductions in several osteoclast-selective mRNAs, but levels of various osteoclast proteins were not reduced, as determined by quantitative immunoblots, even when their mRNA levels were reduced. Immunoblots demonstrated that proteolytic processing of TRAP5b and the cytoskeletal protein L-plastin was altered in cells treated with 50 μM enoxacin. Flow cytometry revealed that enoxacin treatment favored the expression of high levels of DC-STAMP on the surface of osteoclasts. Our data show that enoxacin directly inhibits osteoclast formation without affecting cell viability by a novel mechanism that involves changes in posttranslational processing and trafficking of several proteins with known roles in osteoclast function. We propose that these effects are downstream to blocking the binding interaction between a3-containing V-ATPases and microfilaments."
https://openalex.org/W2021630335,"Insect stage trypanosomes use an ""acetate shuttle"" to transfer mitochondrial acetyl-CoA to the cytosol for the essential fatty acid biosynthesis. The mitochondrial acetate sources are acetate:succinate CoA-transferase (ASCT) and an unknown enzymatic activity. We have identified a gene encoding acetyl-CoA thioesterase (ACH) activity, which is shown to be the second acetate source. First, RNAi-mediated repression of ASCT in the ACH null background abolishes acetate production from glucose, as opposed to both single ASCT and ACH mutants. Second, incorporation of radiolabeled glucose into fatty acids is also abolished in this ACH/ASCT double mutant. ASCT is involved in ATP production, whereas ACH is not, because the ASCT null mutant is ∼1000 times more sensitive to oligomycin, a specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial F(0)/F(1)-ATP synthase, than wild-type cells or the ACH null mutant. This was confirmed by RNAi repression of the F(0)/F(1)-ATP synthase F(1)β subunit, which is lethal when performed in the ASCT null background but not in the wild-type cells or the ACH null background. We concluded that acetate is produced from both ASCT and ACH; however, only ASCT is responsible, together with the F(0)/F(1)-ATP synthase, for ATP production in the mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W2056564957,"The ability to balance self-renewal and differentiation is a hallmark of stem cells. In Drosophila neural stem cells (NSCs), Numb/Notch (N) signaling plays a key role in this process. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Numb function in a stem cell setting remain poorly defined. Here we show that α-Adaptin (α-Ada), a subunit of the endocytic AP-2 complex, interacts with Numb through a new mode of interaction to regulate NSC homeostasis. In α-ada mutants, N pathway component Sanpodo and the N receptor itself exhibited altered trafficking, and N signaling was up-regulated in the intermediate progenitors of type II NSC lineages, leading to their transformation into ectopic NSCs. Surprisingly, although the Ear domain of α-Ada interacts with the C terminus of Numb and is important for α-Ada function in the sensory organ precursor lineage, it was dispensable in the NSCs. Instead, α-Ada could regulate Sanpodo, N trafficking, and NSC homeostasis by interacting with Numb through new domains in both proteins previously not known to mediate their interaction. This interaction could be bypassed when α-Ada was directly fused to the phospho-tyrosine binding domain of Numb. Our results identify a critical role for the AP-2-mediated endocytosis in regulating NSC behavior and reveal a new mechanism by which Numb regulates NSC behavior through N. These findings are likely to have important implications for cancer biology."

Here, we examined the evening onset of melatonin secretion, an important hormone for the initiation of sleep, in people with a complete cervical (tetraplegia) and thoracic (paraplegia) SCI, and age- and sex-matched able-bodied control participants. Multiple samples of salivary melatonin were obtained during the evening hours and analyzed by ELISA methods in 10 control partcipants, 9 individuals with paraplegia, and 6 individuals with tetraplegia. Sleep quality was assessed using questionnaires. Interactive effects of group and time were found for melatonin levels (P=0.022). In the control and paraplegia groups, the mean melatonin level increased significantly from 2.59 ± 1.04 and 4.28 ± 3.28 pg/ml at 7 PM to 10.62 ± 4.59 and 13.10 ± 7.39 pg/ml at 11 PM, respectively (P<0.001). In the tetraplegia group, melatonin level was 5.25 ± 3.72 at 7 PM but only 2.41 ± 1.25 pg/ml at 11 PM (P>0.05). Decreased sleep quality was more prevalent in individuals with tetraplegia (83%) and paraplegia (75%) compared with controls (20%; P= 0.02). Unlike in the control and paraplegia groups, the evening increase in melatonin concentration was completely absent in the tetraplegia group. This provides biological insight into sleep regulation in humans and provides better understanding of the poor sleep quality in people with tetraplegia.—Verheggen, R.

This mutant form of CFTR is characterized by a folding and trafficking defect that prevents exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. We previously reported that ΔF508 CFTR can be recovered in a complex with Hsp90 and its co-chaperones as an on-pathway folding intermediate, suggesting that Δ508 CF disease arises due to a failure of the proteostasis network (PN), which manages protein folding and degradation in the cell. We have now examined the role of FK506-binding protein 8 (FKBP8), a component of the CFTR interactome, during the biogenesis of wild-type and ΔF508 CFTR. FKBP8 is a member of the peptidylprolyl isomerase family that mediates the cis/trans interconversion of peptidyl prolyl bonds. Our results suggest that FKBP8 is a key PN factor required at a post-Hsp90 step in CFTR biogenesis. In addition, changes in its expression level or alteration of its activity by a peptidylprolyl isomerase inhibitor alter CFTR stability and transport. We propose that CF is caused by the sequential failure of the prevailing PN pathway to stabilize ΔF508-CFTR for endoplasmic reticulum export, a pathway that can be therapeutically managed."

When studying complex diseases such as CaP that have a heritable component, chances of finding true disease susceptibility alleles can be increased by accounting for genetic ancestry within the population investigated. Race, ethnicity and ancestry were studied in a geographically diverse cohort of men with newly diagnosed CaP.Individual ancestry (IA) was estimated in the population-based North Carolina and Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP), a cohort of 2,106 incident CaP cases (2063 with complete ethnicity information) comprising roughly equal numbers of research subjects reporting as Black/African American (AA) or European American/Caucasian/Caucasian American/White (EA) from North Carolina or Louisiana. Mean genome wide individual ancestry estimates of percent African, European and Asian were obtained and tested for differences by state and ethnicity (Cajun and/or Creole and Hispanic/Latino) using multivariate analysis of variance models. Principal components (PC) were compared to assess differences in genetic composition by self-reported race and ethnicity between and within states.Mean individual ancestries differed by state for self-reporting AA (p = 0.03) and EA (p = 0.001). This geographic difference attenuated for AAs who answered ""no"" to all ethnicity membership questions (non-ethnic research subjects; p = 0.78) but not EA research subjects, p = 0.002. Mean ancestry estimates of self-identified AA Louisiana research subjects for each ethnic group; Cajun only, Creole only and both Cajun and Creole differed significantly from self-identified non-ethnic AA Louisiana research subjects. These ethnicity differences were not seen in those who self-identified as EA.Mean IA differed by race between states, elucidating a potential contributing factor to these differences in AA research participants: self-reported ethnicity.

Much less is known about O-glycoproteins in this regard because only human zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (ZP3) and bovine proopiomelanocortin were reported to be LacdiNAc-modified. In searching for mammalian proteins modified with O-linked LacdiNAc we identified six positive species among nine endogenous and recombinant O-glycoproteins, which were extracellular matrix, or matrix-related proteins. These are ZP3 and the five novel LacdiNAc-positive species ECM1, AMACO, nidogen-1, α-dystroglycan, and neurofascin. The mass spectrometric analyses revealed a core 2-based tetrasaccharide as the common structural basis of O-linked LacdiNAc that could be further modified, similar to the type 2 LacNAc termini, with fucose, sialic acid, or sulfate. Here, we provide structural evidence for a novel type of mucin-type O-glycans that is strictly specific for LacdiNAc termini: sugar phosphorylation with formation of GalNAcβ1–4(phospho-)GlcNAc. The structural details of the phosphatase-labile compound were elucidated by MS2 analysis of tetralysine complexes and by MSn measurements of the permethylated glycan alditols. Phospho-LacdiNAc was detected in human HEK-293 as well as in mouse myoblast cells and in bovine brain tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2113813368,"Increased glutamatergic input, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity, in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is closely associated with high sympathetic outflow in essential hypertension. The molecular mechanisms underlying augmented NMDAR activity in hypertension are unclear. GluN2 subunit composition at the synaptic site critically determines NMDAR functional properties. Here, we found that evoked NMDAR-excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) of retrogradely labeled spinally projecting PVN neurons displayed a larger amplitude and shorter decay time in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) than in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Blocking GluN2B caused a smaller decrease in NMDAR-EPSCs of PVN neurons in SHRs than in WKY rats. In contrast, GluN2A blockade resulted in a larger reduction in evoked NMDAR-EPSCs and puff NMDA-elicited currents of PVN neurons in SHRs than in WKY rats. Blocking presynaptic GluN2A, but not GluN2B, significantly reduced the frequency of miniature EPSCs and the firing activity of PVN neurons in SHRs. The mRNA and total protein levels of GluN2A and GluN2B in the PVN were greater in SHRs than in WKY rats. Furthermore, the GluN2B Ser(1480) phosphorylation level and the synaptosomal GluN2A protein level in the PVN were significantly higher in SHRs than in WKY rats. Inhibition of protein kinase CK2 normalized the GluN2B Ser(1480) phosphorylation level and the contribution of GluN2A to NMDAR-EPSCs and miniature EPSCs of PVN neurons in SHRs. Collectively, our findings suggest that CK2-mediated GluN2B phosphorylation contributes to increased synaptic GluN2A, which potentiates pre- and postsynaptic NMDAR activity and the excitability of PVN presympathetic neurons in hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2155621610,"In dendritic cells (DCs), chemotactic chemokines, such as CXCL12, rapidly increase cytosolic Ca(2+)concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) by triggering Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores followed by store-operated Ca(2+) (SOC) entry. Increase of [Ca(2+)](i) is blunted and terminated by Ca(2+) extrusion, accomplished by K(+)-independent Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers (NCXs) and K(+)-dependent Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers (NCKXs). Increased [Ca(2+)](i) activates energy-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which suppresses proinflammatory responses of DCs and macrophages. The present study explored whether AMPK participates in the regulation of DC [Ca(2+)](i) and migration. DCs were isolated from AMPKα1-deficient (ampk(-/-)) mice and, as control, from their wild-type (ampk(+/+)) littermates. AMPKα1, Orai1-2, STIM1-2, and mitochondrial calcium uniporter protein expression was determined by Western blotting, [Ca(2+)](i) by Fura-2 fluorescence, SOC entry by inhibition of endosomal Ca(2+) ATPase with thapsigargin (1 μM), Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger activity from increase of [Ca(2+)](i), and respective whole-cell current in patch clamp following removal of extracellular Na(+). Migration was quantified utilizing transwell chambers. AMPKα1 protein is expressed in ampk(+/+) DCs but not in ampk(-/-) DCs. CXCL12 (300 ng/ml)-induced increase of [Ca(2+)](i), SOC entry, Orai 1 protein abundance, NCX, and NCKX were all significantly higher in ampk(-/-) DCs than in ampk(+/+) DCs. NCX and NCKX currents were similarly increased in ampk(-/-) DCs. Moreover, CXCL12 (50 ng/ml)-induced DC migration was enhanced in ampk(-/-) DCs.

https://openalex.org/W1971362420,"Heterotrimeric G-proteins and the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins, which accelerate the inherent GTPase activity of Gα proteins, are common in animals and encoded by large gene families; however, in plants G-protein signaling is thought to be more limited in scope. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana contains one Gα, one Gβ, three Gγ, and one RGS protein. Recent examination of the Glycine max (soybean) genome reveals a larger set of G-protein-related genes and raises the possibility of more intricate G-protein networks than previously observed in plants. Stopped-flow analysis of GTP-binding and GDP/GTP exchange for the four soybean Gα proteins (GmGα1-4) reveals differences in their kinetic properties. The soybean genome encodes two chimeric RGS proteins with an N-terminal seven transmembrane domain and a C-terminal RGS box. Both GmRGS interact with each of the four GmGα and regulate their GTPase activity. The GTPase-accelerating activities of GmRGS1 and -2 differ for each GmGα, suggesting more than one possible rate of the G-protein cycle initiated by each of the Gα proteins. The differential effects of GmRGS1 and GmRGS2 on GmGα1-4 result from a single valine versus alanine difference. The emerging picture suggests complex regulation of the G-protein cycle in soybean and in other plants with expanded G-protein networks."

Our previous work implicated the cytoplasmic N terminus of the sodium channel Na(v)1.6 in this process. We report that the N terminus plus the first transmembrane segment (residues 1-153) is sufficient to direct a reporter to the cell surface. To identify proteins that interact with the 117-residue N-terminal domain, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA library. Three clones containing overlapping portions of the light chain of microtubule-associated protein Map1b (Mtap1b) were recovered from the screen. Interaction between endogenous Na(v)1.6 channels and Map1b in mouse brain was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Map1b did not interact with the N terminus of the related channel Na(v)1.1. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the Na(v)1.6 N terminus demonstrated that residues 77-80 (VAVP) contribute to interaction with Map1b. Co-expression of Na(v)1.6 with Map1b in neuronal cell line ND7/23 resulted in a 50% increase in current density, demonstrating a functional role for this interaction. Mutation of the Map1b binding site of Na(v)1.6 prevented generation of sodium current in transfected cells.

NPY plays a key role in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo under both basal and pathological conditions, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We have investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) on the neurogenic effects of NPY. Using postnatal rat hippocampal cultures, we show that the proliferative effect of NPY on nestin(+) precursor cells is NO-dependent. As well as the involvement of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, the proliferative effect is mediated via an NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling pathway. We show that NPY-mediated intracellular NO signaling results in an increase in neuroproliferation. By contrast, extracellular NO had an opposite, inhibitory effect on proliferation. The importance of the NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway in ERK1/2 activation was confirmed using Western blotting. This work unites two significant modulators of hippocampal neurogenesis within a common signaling framework and provides a mechanism for the independent extra- and intracellular regulation of postnatal neural precursors by NO."

As a direct regulating molecule for SMA, we identified and characterized scleraxis (Scx) as a new phenotype modulator in advanced glycation end product (AGE)-exposed MCs. Scx physically associated with E12 and bound the E-box in the promoter of SMA and negatively regulated the AGE-induced SMA expression. Scx induced expression and secretion of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), thereby controlling the Smad1 activation in AGE-treated MCs. In diabetic mice, Scx was concomitantly expressed with SMA in the glomeruli. Inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) was further induced by extended treatment with AGE, thereby dislodging Scx from the SMA promoter.

Scx physically associated with E12 and bound the E-box in the promoter of SMA and negatively regulated the AGE-induced SMA expression. Scx induced expression and secretion of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), thereby controlling the Smad1 activation in AGE-treated MCs. In diabetic mice, Scx was concomitantly expressed with SMA in the glomeruli. Inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) was further induced by extended treatment with AGE, thereby dislodging Scx from the SMA promoter. These data suggest that Scx and Id1 are involved in the BMP4-Smad1-SMA signal transduction pathway besides the TGFβ1-Smad1-SMA signaling pathway and modulate phenotypic changes in MCs in diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy is a morbid complication associated with diabetes mellitus and is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease. Glomerulosclerosis in diabetic nephropathy is caused by accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixAGEadvanced glycation end productbHLHbasic helix-loop-helixCMLcarboxymethyl lysineIdinhibitor of differentiationMCmesangial cellScxscleraxisSMAsmooth muscle α-actinSTZstreptozotocinCol1type I collagenRACE5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end. proteins in the mesangial interstitial space, resulting in the narrowing and obliteration of glomerular capillaries (1Klahr S.

Emerging evidence suggests that the cause of glomerulosclerosis in diabetic nephropathy is phenotypic switching of MCs to an activated state. In response to injury, MCs can transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, a specialized population of mesenchymal cells that secrete interstitial collagens (i.e. type I and type III collagens) that are not normally present in the mesangial matrix and markedly up-regulate the expression of smooth muscle-like proteins (i.e. SMA) (2Johnson R.J.

The fundamental significance of myofibroblasts and SMA expression is unclear, although these actions may lead to prevention of cell migration and concentrate these cells at the site of injury (5Rønnov-Jessen L.

Furthermore, this phenotypic alteration, which is characterized by SMA gene induction, is a common phenomenon in the process of sclerotic or fibrotic changes in many organs, such as the liver (6Ramadori G.

Recently, we demonstrated that Smad1 plays a key role in the progression of various renal diseases such as diabetic nephropathy and proliferative glomerulonephritis (4Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T. Type IV collagen is transcriptionally regulated by Smad1 under advanced glycation end product (AGE) stimulation.J. Biol.

Smad1 transcriptionally up-regulates ECM proteins (type IV and type I collagens and osteopontin) in the common process of progressing glomerulosclerosis (4Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T. Type IV collagen is transcriptionally regulated by Smad1 under advanced glycation end product (AGE) stimulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14201-14206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, induction of Smad1 and SMA expression coincides with the development of glomerulosclerosis in diabetic rats (10Matsubara T. Abe H. Arai H. Nagai K. Mima A. Kanamori H. Sumi E. Takahashi T.

Furthermore, we reported that urinary Smad1 is a novel marker to detect the initial stage of glomerulosclerosis in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic rodents (10Matsubara T. Abe H. Arai H. Nagai K.

Urinary Smad1 is a novel marker to predict later onset of mesangial matrix expansion in diabetic nephropathy.Diabetes. 2008; 57: 1712-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, Smad1 was thought to be closely involved in the phenotypic change of MCs in diabetes. However, there is little information about which molecule stands between Smad1 and SMA, modulating the phenotype of MCs. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors have been implicated in cell fate specification in a variety of cell lineages. Examples of these proteins include the myogenic bHLH factors MyoD and myogenin in muscle development (12Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D.

U.S.A. 1989; 86: 10128-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Cell type-specific bHLH proteins typically form heterodimers with ubiquitous bHLH proteins, such as E12/E47 (products of the E2A gene), through the HLH domains (18Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. A new DNA binding and dimerization motif in immunoglobulin enhancer binding, daughterless, MyoD, and Myc proteins.Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) and enable the basic region to form a bipartite DNA-binding motif that recognizes the so-called E-box sequence CANNTG (19Massari M.E. Murre C. Helix-loop-helix proteins. Regulators of transcription in eucaryotic organisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). In addition, four Id proteins, Id1 through Id4, lack the DNA binding activity due to the absence of a basic domain and have been characterized as negative regulators of bHLH transcription factors. The majority of information concerning the role of bHLH proteins in the process of differentiation has been investigated during embryogenesis. Few studies have examined the role of these proteins in adults or in diseases. Although E-box sites are present in the promoter of the SMA gene, no MC-specific bHLH transcription factors have yet been identified. In this study, we identified scleraxis (Scx) as a binding factor to the promoter of SMA and established the mechanism and function of Scx-mediated SMA expression under diabetic conditions. As described above, in glomerulosclerosis activated MCs produce bone ECM proteins (type I collagen (Col1) and osteopontin) as well as SMA. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) has been implicated in several aspects of embryonic development, from establishment of the basic embryonic body plan to morphogenesis of some organs, including the kidney, by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and chemotaxis (20Hogan B.L. Bone morphogenetic proteins. Multifunctional regulators of vertebrate development.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar, 21Miyazaki Y. Oshima K. Fogo A. Hogan B.L. Ichikawa I. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 regulates the budding site and elongation of the mouse ureter.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). BMP4 is also involved in the commitment of mesenchymal cells to chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages (22Erlebacher A. Filvaroff E.H. Gitelman S.E. Derynck R. Toward a molecular understanding of skeletal development.Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 23Reddi A.H. Role of morphogenetic proteins in skeletal tissue engineering and regeneration.Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). However, the functional roles of BMP4 in adults or in diseases remain elusive. In this study, we reveal an important role of BMP4 for activation of Smad1-SMA signal transduction in the process of phenotypic alteration in MCs. Moreover, we elucidated the molecular mechanism for negative regulation of SMA by Scx in MCs. However, Scx positively regulated BMP4-induced SMA expression. The animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facility of Tokushima University. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines, and the Review Board of Tokushima University granted ethical permission for this study. Male C57BL/6 mice, 8 weeks old, weighing 22–24 g were rendered diabetic by the intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg per kg body weight streptozotocin (STZ) in citrate buffer, pH 4.5, for 5 consecutive days. The diabetic state was confirmed 5 days after final injection by measurement of the blood glucose level. All mice that were given STZ had a blood glucose concentration exceeding 400 mg/dl and were considered diabetic (24Makibayashi K. Tatematsu M. Hirata M. Fukushima N. Kusano K. Ohashi S. Abe H.

Control BSA was prepared by incubating BSA without glucose 6-phosphate under the same conditions as those for AGE-BSA. Preparations were tested for endotoxin using an Endospecy ES-24S system (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan), and no endotoxin was detected. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using BSA as the standard. Nϵ-(Carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) was purchased from Nippi Protein Engineering (Tokyo, Japan). A glomerular MC line was established from glomeruli isolated from normal 4-week-old mice (C57BL/6J×SJL/J) and was identified according to the method described previously (26Davies M.

The MCs were plated on 100-mm plastic dishes (Nunc Roskilde, Denmark) and maintained in B medium (a 3:1 mixture of minimal essential medium/F-12 modified with trace elements) supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, penicillin at 100 units/ml, streptomycin at 100 mg/ml, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). The cultured cells fulfilled the generally accepted criteria for glomerular MCs described previously (26Davies M. The mesangial cell. A tissue culture view.Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 320-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). AGE or BSA exposure was carried out as described previously (4Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T. Type IV collagen is transcriptionally regulated by Smad1 under advanced glycation end product (AGE) stimulation.J. Biol.

CML was added to the MC culture medium at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml after overnight starvation. The full-length cDNAs of Smad1 and E12 were obtained using gene-specific primers for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and inserted into pcDNA3 or pCMV-Myc (resulting in pcDNA3-Smad1 and Myc-E12). The full-length of Scx cDNA was inserted into p3×FLAG-CMV (Sigma) to construct the NH2-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged Scx (FLAG-Scx). A monoclonal antibody (M2; Sigma) directed toward this epitope was used in the Western blot experiments. For expression studies, the Scx gene was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression plasmid. Mouse constitutively active ALK1 (caALK1) was generated by mutation of Glu-194 into aspartic acid. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by a PCR-based approach and was inserted into pCMV-Myc. Constitutively active Smad1 (caSmad1) was obtained by substitution of Ser-463 and Ser-465 of mouse Smad1 vector (kindly provided from Prof. Miyazono, University of Tokyo) with aspartic acid. The constructed plasmids were verified by sequencing. Constitutively active Smad3 (caSmad3) expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. J. Oh (Korea University). Degenerate PCR primers were designed according to two highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs in the basic region and second helix region of the bHLH proteins. Scx was obtained by the RT-PCR method using the following two degenerate primers: 5′-CCAA(C/T)GC(A/C/G/T)CGIGA(A/G)CG(A/C/G/T)(A/G)-3′ and 5′-CCAG(A/G)TGIG(A/C)(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TA(A/G)CT(A/C/G/T)GA(A/C/G/T)GC-3′, corresponding to the target amino acid sequences of NARER(D/N) and ASSYIAHL, respectively (29Narumi O.

One microgram of total RNA of mouse MCs treated with AGE or BSA was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primer using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II; Invitrogen) in a total volume of 30 μl. RT-negative controls were performed to exclude the possibility of genomic or other DNA contamination. Full-length cDNA clones for Scx were isolated by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) using poly(A)+ RNA from mouse MCs. RACE was performed using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Total RNA was extracted from mouse MCs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primer using a SuperScript first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) to generate the first-strand cDNA, followed by PCR to detect the expression of Scx and GAPDH. The sequences of the PCR primers were as follows: 5′-GACCGCACCAACAGCGTGAA-3′ and 5′-GTGGACCCTCCTCCTTCTAACTTC-3′ for Scx; 5′-CTCTGGACGTACAACTGGTATTG-3′ and 5′-TGGATGCCCGCTGACTCCAT-3′ for SMA; and 5′-TATGACTCCACTCACGGCAAAT-3′ and 5′-TGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGT-3′ for GAPDH. The reaction products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. We generated polyclonal antibodies (Scx1 and Scx2) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 169–185 of mouse Scx and confirmed their specificity by dot blot analysis with the antigenic peptide. For Western blot analyses, results using Scx1 were shown in each figure. The anti-E12, anti-E2A, and anti-ALK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Smad1 (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA); anti-pSmad1/5/8, anti-Smad2, anti-Smad3, and anti-pSmad3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); anti-TGFβ3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); anti-TGFβ1, anti-TGFβ2, and anti-SMA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK); anti-FLAG, anti-β-actin, and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma); anti-Myc (Clontech); and anti-Col1 (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) antibodies were used for Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation assay. The anti-pSmad1 (Cell Signaling), anti-SMA, and anti-Scx1 antibodies were used for immunofluorescent staining. Polyclonal anti-TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody (AB10-NA) and monoclonal anti-BMP4 neutralizing antibody (MAB757) (R&D Systems) were used for inhibition assays. Proteins from MCs or mouse total kidneys were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare), subjected to Western blot analysis using primary antibodies, and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Invitrogen). EMSA was performed using oligonucleotides corresponding to specific E-boxes (E1 5′-GGCAGCTCAGCTGCTTATGGG-3′ and E2 5′-GCCCTCAGAACAACTGCTCAAATG-3′). Briefly, the nuclear pellet was collected by centrifugation (600 × g, 10 min, 4 ºC). The nuclear lysates (100 μg) were prepared and incubated in 25 μl of reaction mixture containing poly(dI/dC), 10× binding buffer (50 μm ZnCl2, 0.25 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol), and the labeled oligonucleotide for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were terminated using 25 μl of the loading dye and loaded onto a 7% gel retardation assay gel. The run was performed at 250 V for 3 h at 4 ºC. At the end of the run, the gel was removed, dried, and exposed in a phosphorimager at room temperature. CHOK1 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, and 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitors mixture; Roche Applied Science) was added. The cell lysates were precleared with normal rabbit IgG. Equal amounts of protein were incubated with 10 μl of rabbit anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody for 3 h at 4 ºC with constant rotation. The immune complex was isolated with protein G-Sepharose (2 h at 4 ºC), and the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with sample buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, a portion of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE before Western blot analyses. Kidneys isolated from STZ-induced diabetic mice and nondiabetic control mice were minced and suspended in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% deoxycholate. The tissue suspension was homogenized, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-E12 antibody and control immunoglobulin G. The presence of Scx in the immunoprecipitates was determined by Western blotting with anti-Scx antibody. MCs (0.15 × 105) were plated in 24-well plates and 6 h later co-transfected with increasing amounts of Myc-E12 expression plasmid. Trasfections were perfomed using FuGENE 6. Luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities derived from co-transfected pRL-SV40-Luc (Promega). MCs (1.0 × 105) were seeded into 6-well plates (Nunc) and grown until they were 40–60% confluent. The Smad1, Scx, E12, Id1, and ALK1 siRNA (Invitrogen) and the control siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) were combined with INTERFERin reagent (Polyplus Transfection, New York), and the cells were transfected with siRNA (100 nm) according to the recommended protocol. Tissues were fixed in methyl Carnoy's solution and were paraffin-embedded. Multiple sections were prepared and stained with periodic acid silver methenamine and periodic acid-Schiff's reagent. Cryopreserved kidney tissues were cut into 5-μm-thick sections and fixed in methanol at 4 ºC for 15 min. To eliminate nonspecific staining, sections were incubated with the appropriate preimmune serum for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubating with the primary antibodies. For detection, appropriate biotinylated or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for visualization. ChIP assays were performed essentially as described previously (4Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T.

We used anti-E2A antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Scx antibody, or normal control IgG at 4 ºC overnight. PCR was performed with primers to amplify the region containing the E-box on the SMA promoter. The 5′-primer was 5′-GGAGCTCCCCAATTTGTTG-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-CAGCCTCCGCCTCTTACC-3′. Input DNA (2.5%) was used as a template in the PCR. Although we previously reported that AGE induces and phosphorylates Smad1 (4Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T.

Invest. 2006; 86: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), interaction between Smad1 and SMA in MCs in diabetic conditions remained unknown. Induction of SMA as well as Smad1 and pSmad1 was observed in AGE-treated MCs (Fig. 1A). TGFβ has been known to play an important role in the AGE response of the glomeruli (30Yang C.W. Vlassara H. Peten E.P. He C.J. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Advanced glycation end products up-regulate gene expression found in diabetic glomerular disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

TGFβ1 expression was markedly up-regulated in diabetic mice. In contrast, alteration of TGFβ2 and TGFβ3 expressions was not observed (Fig. 1B). Similar changes were found in MCs treated with AGE (Fig. 1C). To elucidate the effect of TGFβ1 on the induction of SMA by AGE in MCs, an inhibition assay using the TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody was performed (Fig. 1D). MCs treated with the TGFβ1-neutralizing antibody showed significant reduction of pSmad3 up-regulated by AGE. However, small reduction of Smad1, pSmad1, and SMA expression induced by AGE was observed (Fig. 1D). To confirm the role of Smad3 in AGE-induced SMA expression, siRNA knockdown for Smad3 was carried out. Smad3 knockdown did not appear to affect the expression of SMA in AGE-treated MCs (Fig. 2E). To further examine and confirm the effect of Smad3 on the SMA expression, we performed transient overexpression of constitutively active Smad3 (caSmad3) in MCs, resulting in no increase in the protein levels of SMA (Fig. 2F).FIGURE 2Activated Smad1 induces SMA expression in MCs.

https://openalex.org/W2093961756,"PU.1 is an essential transcription factor in normal hematopoietic lineage development. It recognizes a large number of promoter sites differing only in bases flanking a core consensus of 5'-GGAA-3'. DNA binding is mediated by its ETS domain, whose sequence selectivity directly corresponds to the transactivational activity and frequency of binding sites for full-length PU.1 in vivo. To better understand the basis of sequence discrimination, we characterized its binding properties to a high affinity and low affinity site. Despite sharing a homologous structural framework as confirmed by DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting, the two complexes exhibit striking heterogeneity in terms of hydration properties. High affinity binding is destabilized by osmotic stress, whereas low affinity binding is insensitive. Dimethyl sulfate footprinting showed that the major groove at the core consensus is protected in the high affinity complex but accessible in the low affinity one. Finally, destabilization of low affinity binding by salt is in quantitative agreement with the number of phosphate contacts but is substantially attenuated in high affinity binding. These observations support a mechanism of sequence discrimination wherein specifically bound water molecules couple flanking backbone contacts with base-specific interactions in a sequestered cavity at the core consensus. The implications of this model with respect to other ETS paralogs are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2007134756,"HIV transmission in rural areas of China is being fueled in part by migrant workers who acquire HIV outside of their hometowns. Recent surveillance statistics indicate that HIV prevalence among returning migrants has increased significantly.We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study to assess HIV-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors among migrant returnees in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, one of the largest exporters of migrant laborers.A total of 1625 subjects were enrolled with a response rate of 89%. All participants were male and of the majority Han ethnicity. The mean age was 39.0 years (SD = 6.7; range: 18 to 63), and most had a stable partner (N = 1533, 94.3%). Most correctly identified the major modes of HIV transmission (68.9%-82.0%), but fewer were able to identify ways that HIV cannot be transmitted. Nearly one-third of participants held positive attitudes toward having multiple sex partners, and nearly half believed that sex work should be legalized. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that risky sexual behavior (defined as sex with a casual or commercial sex partner) was associated with no stable partner; working abroad; correct condom use; age <22 at first sex; higher coital frequency; and having a positive attitude towards multiple sex partners.We found high levels of reported sex with a casual or commercial sex partner and low levels of consistent condom use. HIV prevention interventions among migrant workers need to focus on younger migrants, migrants without stable partners, and migrants who travel abroad for work."
https://openalex.org/W2026517098,"A large body of in vitro evolution work establishes the utility of biopolymer libraries comprising 1010 to 1015 distinct molecules for the discovery of nanomolar-affinity ligands to proteins.[1], [2], [3], [4], [5] Small-molecule libraries of comparable complexity will likely provide nanomolar-affinity small-molecule ligands.[6], [7] Unlike biopolymers, small molecules can offer the advantages of cell permeability, low immunogenicity, metabolic stability, rapid diffusion and inexpensive mass production. It is thought that such desirable in vivo behavior is correlated with the physical properties of small molecules, specifically a limited number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, a defined range of hydrophobicity, and most importantly, molecular weights less than 500 Daltons.[8] Creating a collection of 1010 to 1015 small molecules that meet these criteria requires the use of hundreds to thousands of diversity elements per step in a combinatorial synthesis of three to five steps. With this goal in mind, we have reported a set of mesofluidic devices that enable DNA-programmed combinatorial chemistry in a highly parallel 384-well plate format. Here, we demonstrate that these devices can translate DNA genes encoding 384 diversity elements per coding position into corresponding small-molecule gene products. This robust and efficient procedure yields small molecule-DNA conjugates suitable for in vitro evolution experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2057594326,"Background The Chlamydia trachomatis incidence rate in Finnmark, the most northern and sparsely populated county in Norway, has been twice the national average. This population based cross-sectional study among Finnmark high school students had the following aims: i) to examine distribution of multilocus sequence types (STs) of C. trachomatis in a previously unmapped area, ii) to compare chlamydia genetic diversity in Finnmark with that of two urban regions, and iii) to compare discriminatory capacity of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) with conventional ompA sequencing in a large number of chlamydia specimens. Methodology ompA sequencing and a high-resolution MLST system based on PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of five highly variable genetic regions were used. Eighty chlamydia specimens from adolescents aged 15–20 years in Finnmark were collected in five high schools (n = 60) and from routine clinical samples in the laboratory (n = 20). These were compared to routine clinical samples from adolescents in Tromsø (n = 80) and Trondheim (n = 88), capitals of North and Central Norway, respectively. Principal Findings ompA sequencing detected 11 genotypes in 248 specimens from all three areas. MLST displayed 50 STs providing a five-fold higher resolution. Two-thirds of all STs were novel. The common ompA E/Bour genotype comprised 46% and resolved into 24 different STs. MLST identified the Swedish new variant of C. trachomatis not discriminated by ompA sequencing. Simpson's discriminatory index (D) was 0.93 for MLST, while a corrected Dc was 0.97. There were no statistically significant differences in ST genetic diversity between geographic areas. Finnmark had an atypical genovar distribution with G being predominant. This was mainly due to expansion of specific STs of which the novel ST161 was unique for Finnmark. Conclusions/Significance MLST revealed multiple new STs and a larger genetic diversity in comparison to ompA sequencing and proved to be a useful tool in molecular epidemiology of chlamydia infections."
https://openalex.org/W2061686084,"Pregnenolone (PREG) can be converted to PREG esters (PE) by the plasma enzyme lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and by other enzyme(s) with unknown identity. Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 and 2 (ACAT1 and ACAT2) convert various sterols to steryl esters; their activities are activated by cholesterol. PREG is a sterol-like molecule, with 3-β-hydroxy moiety at steroid ring A, but with much shorter side chain at steroid ring D. Here we show that without cholesterol, PREG is a poor ACAT substrate; with cholesterol, the V(max) for PREG esterification increases by 100-fold. The binding affinity of ACAT1 for PREG is 30-50-fold stronger than that for cholesterol; however, PREG is only a substrate but not an activator, while cholesterol is both a substrate and an activator. These results indicate that the sterol substrate site in ACAT1 does not involve significant sterol-phospholipid interaction, while the sterol activator site does. Studies utilizing small molecule ACAT inhibitors show that ACAT plays a key role in PREG esterification in various cell types examined. Mice lacking ACAT1 or ACAT2 do not have decreased PREG ester contents in adrenals, nor do they have altered levels of the three major secreted adrenal steroids in serum. Mice lacking LCAT have decreased levels of PREG esters in the adrenals. These results suggest LCAT along with ACAT1/ACAT2 contribute to control pregnenolone ester content in different cell types and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2097493900,"6-Phosphofructokinases (Pfk) are homo- and heterooligomeric, allosteric enzymes that catalyze one of the rate-limiting steps of the glycolysis: the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate at position 1. Pfk activity is modulated by a number of regulators including adenine nucleotides. Recent crystal structures from eukaryotic Pfk revealed several adenine nucleotide binding sites. Herein, we determined the functional relevance of two adenine nucleotide binding sites through site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme kinetic studies. Subsequent characterization of Pfk mutants allowed the identification of the activating (AMP, ADP) and inhibitory (ATP, ADP) allosteric binding sites. Mutation of one binding site reciprocally influenced the allosteric regulation through nucleotides interacting with the other binding site. Such reciprocal linkage between the activating and inhibitory binding sites is in agreement with current models of allosteric enzyme regulation. Because the allosteric nucleotide binding sites in eukaryotic Pfk did not evolve from prokaryotic ancestors, reciprocal linkage of functionally opposed allosteric binding sites must have developed independently in prokaryotic and eukaryotic Pfk (convergent evolution). 6-Phosphofructokinases (Pfk) are homo- and heterooligomeric, allosteric enzymes that catalyze one of the rate-limiting steps of the glycolysis: the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate at position 1.

Note that ATP serves as a substrate and as an allosteric inhibitor of eukaryotic Pfk. ADP can act as an activator at μm concentrations but inhibits eukaryotic Pfk activity at mm concentrations (16.Mediavilla D. Metón I. Baanante I.V.

Biol. 2011; 407: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were determined. In the crystal structure of P. pastoris Pfk, an additional ATP binding pocket was found in each β chain, which was presumed to be an inactivating site (15.Sträter N. Marek S. Kuettner E.B. Kloos M.

Molecular architecture and structural basis of allosteric regulation of eukaryotic phosphofructokinases.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the structure of rabbit muscle Pfk, this ATP binding site was also discovered in the N-terminal domain of each subunit with either ADP or ATP bound to it. An additional novel ADP binding site was found in the center of each subunit (13.Banaszak K. Mechin I. Obmolova G. Oldham M. Chang S.H. Ruiz T. Radermacher M. Kopperschläger G. Rypniewski W.

This was proposed as an activating (ADP binding) site because replacement by ATP failed (see Fig. 1). Neither of these two binding sites evolved from a regulatory or catalytic binding site in bacterial Pfk. Fig. 1B shows a superposition of the E. coli Pfk with its two equivalent effector binding sites at the subunit interfaces. The superposition of rabbit and E. coli Pfk suggests that the effector binding sites of the bacterial protein are maintained in the mammalian enzyme but only a phosphate ion is bound to this site. Because ADP is found in at least two binding sites, the functional relevance of the individual binding sites is still unclear. Furthermore, it is unknown whether additional binding sites exist in Pfk mediating the activating and inhibitory effects of adenine nucleotides. There is no crystal structure with AMP bound to Pfk available yet. Here, we experimentally addressed the functional relevance of the canonical activating and inhibitory adenine nucleotide binding sites through mutagenesis and kinetic studies. We functionally qualified the adenine nucleotide binding sites and identified a reciprocal linkage between these allosteric binding sites.

The gel was washed on a funnel with buffer B. Elution was done with buffer A, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm Fru-6-P and 5 mm ATP. The enzyme was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Omega 100-kDa membrane, Pall Life Sciences, Dreieich, Germany). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20% (v/v), and the solution can be stored at −20 °C for weeks without loss of activity. For ion exchange chromatography, the concentrated enzyme sample (without glycerol) was diluted with 0.8 volumes of 0.5× buffer A, pH 8.0, and loaded on a Resource Q-Colum (6 ml, GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany), equilibrated with buffer A, pH 8.0. After washing with buffer A, pH 8.0, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0–200 mm) in buffer A, pH 8.0. Fractions of Pfk activity were pooled and supplemented with 2 mm ATP and 50 μm Fru-1,6-P2. After concentration by ultrafiltration (Pall Life Sciences, Omega 100-kDa membrane) and Vivaspin 6 (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany), 20% glycerol (v/v) was added, and the mixture was stored at −20 °C. Gel permeation chromatography was done on a BioSep SEC-S4000 (600 × 21.2 mm; Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). The column was equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 μm Fru-1,6-P2, pH 7.5.

The purified enzyme can be stored with 30% glycerol (v/v) at −20 °C for 2 weeks without loss of activity. For kinetic studies of wild type and mutant Pfk, the partially purified enzyme after affinity chromatography with F3GA-SephadexTM was used.

The reaction was started with the addition of a 2–5-μl enzyme sample. Kinetic studies were performed in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm NADH, 0.45 units/ml aldolase, 4.5 units/ml triosephosphate isomerase, and 1.5 units/ml glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase. ATP, Fru-6-P, AMP, and ADP were used as indicated. In the case of the ATP inhibition experiments, the MgCl2 concentration was 15 mm. Auxiliary enzymes were dialyzed before use (Micro Bio-Spin 6, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany). The reaction was started by the addition of a 5-μl enzyme sample appropriately diluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10% glycerol. Curve fittings for kinetic parameters were generated by either Michaelis-Menten or Hill equations using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Thus, the hyperbolic and the sigmoid parts of the curves (Vmin to Vmax) were fit to Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations, respectively. To exclude artifacts in the determination of the kinetic parameters using partially purified enzymes, wild type and two mutants (N341A, R246A/K386A) were purified to homogeneity. Because there were no differences in the kinetic parameters, all mutant Pfk were partially purified (see above) and tested in kinetic assays. In the crystal structure of rabbit skeletal muscle Pfk, the diphosphate moiety of ADP in the allosteric activation site is mainly coordinated by Ser377 and Lys678 (Fig. 1C). Mutation of these residues to Ala significantly increased K0.5 for ADP (Table 1). The K0.5 for ADP of the double mutant S377A/K678A was further increased (Table 1), indicating that this ADP binding site is indeed the allosteric activating site in Pfk. The AMP activation of S377A and K678A was less pronounced (Table 1), probably because of weaker or absent interaction between these residues and the monophosphate moiety of AMP.TABLE 1Effect of AMP, ADP, and ATP on kinetic properties of the wild type human muscle Pfk and Pfk mutated at the activating allosteric siteParameterWild typeN341AS377AK678AS377A/K678AWithout effectorsKmATP (μm)42.5 ± 2.023.2 ± 1.937.0 ± 3.032.6 ± 1.427.5 ± 1.7KiATP (mm)2.0 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.021 mm AMPKmATP (μm)49.8 ± 2.752.8 ± 3.643.0 ± 2.738.4 ± 1.741.5 ± 1.7KiATP (mm)8.5 ± 0.15.2 ± 0.18.6 ± 0.18.1 ± 0.15.8 ± 0.10.82 mm ADPKmATP (μm)169 ± 9.9151 ± 13.7168 ± 12.2250 ± 14.0141 ± 8.3KiATP (mm)5.3 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.15.2 ± 0.14.3 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.1K0.5ADP (μm)83.6 ± 0.9610 ± 13.1454 ± 13.0422 ± 3.4506 ± 14.1KiADP (mm)2.1 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.1K0.5AMP (μm)11.9 ± 0.4201 ± 2.919.7 ± 0.517.2 ± 0.849.3 ± 2.1Residual activity (%)52.4 ± 1.66.4 ± 1.057.5 ± 0.233.8 ± 1.326.1 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab Next, we mutated Asn341 to Ala, which interacts with the ribose of ADP (Fig. 1C) and probably also AMP. In contrast to S377A and K678A, N341A not only showed increased K0.5 values for ADP but also significantly reduced enzyme activation by AMP (Fig. 2, A and B, Table 1). ADP and ATP reduced Pfk activity at mm concentrations (Fig. 2, A and C), most likely via binding to the inhibitory nucleotide binding site (Fig. 1, D and E). Strikingly, Ki values of ADP and ATP were significantly reduced in N341A and S377A/K678A (Fig. 2, A and C, Table 1). This effect was found even in the presence of effectors (Fig. 2C, Table 1; data for ADP not shown). In contrast, Ki values of ADP and ATP remained unchanged in S377A and K678A. To test whether mutations in the allosteric activator site influence the substrate dependence of the catalytic activity, the influence of Fru-6-P concentrations was tested in the presence of different effectors. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2, activities of wild type and mutant enzymes exhibited cooperativity to Fru-6-P without effectors. In the presence of the effectors AMP and ADP, the affinity to this substrate was increased. Specifically, N341A and S377A/K678A displayed significantly increased S0.5 values in comparison with the wild type under these conditions.TABLE 2Saturation kinetics for Fru-6-P on the wild type human muscle Pfk and Pfk mutated at the activating allosteric siteParameterWild typeN341AS377AK678AS377A/K678AWithout effectorsS0.5Fru-6-P (mm)1.2 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.1nHFru-6-P (mm)2.6 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.23.0 ± 0.23.0 ± 0.11 mm AMPS0.5Fru-6-P (mm)0.09 ± 0.010.29 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.010.15 ± 0.01nHFru-6-P (mm)1.4 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.10.82 mm ADPS0.5Fru-6-P (mm)0.19 ± 0.010.61 ± 0.010.18 ± 0.010.42 ± 0.010.58 ± 0.01nHFru-6-P (mm)2.7 ± 0.22.6 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.22.5 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab ADP and ATP inhibit Pfk activity by binding to one or more allosteric inhibitory sites. In the rabbit muscle Pfk crystal structure, ADP and ATP in the potential allosteric inhibition site are mainly coordinated by Val228, His242, Arg246, and Lys386 (Fig. 1, D and E). V228A had no significant effects on Pfk activity when compared with the wild type enzyme (data not shown), most probably because of the very conservative structural change. In contrast, mutation of the other three residues to Ala significantly increased Ki for ATP and ADP (Fig. 4, Table 3). Ki values for ATP and ADP of the double mutant R246A/K386A were further increased (Fig. 4, Table 3), indicating that this nucleotide binding site is indeed the allosteric inhibition site of ADP and ATP in mammalian Pfk. Interestingly, all mutants showed significantly higher basal activity in the absence of the activators AMP and ADP (Fig. 4B, Table 3), suggesting that the enzyme is constitutively activated due to mutation in the allosteric inhibitor site. The Fru-6-P dependence of the Ala mutants of His242, Arg246, and Lys386 presented a Michaelis-Menten kinetic indicating a lack of cooperativity (data not shown).TABLE 3Functional characterization of human muscle Pfk modified in the inhibitory allosteric siteParameterWild typeH242AR246AK386AR246A/K386AN341A/R246A/K386AWithout effectorsKmATP (μm)42.5 ± 2.038.2 ± 2.043.2 ± 1.352.4 ± 4.747.7 ± 2.435.6 ± 2.0KiATP (mm)2.0 ± 0.16.8 ± 0.18.6 ± 0.35.6 ± 0.1>10.05.9 ± 0.11 mm AMPKmATP (μm)49.8 ± 2.733.8 ± 2.050.8 ± 5.035.6 ± 1.942.5 ± 1.563.0 ± 2.3KiATP (mm)8.5 ± 0.1>10.0>10.0>10.0>10.08.8 ± 0.10.82 mm ADPKmATP (μm)169 ± 9.9114 ± 4.4166 ± 7.1168 ± 6.0234 ± 13.6220 ± 7.5KiATP (mm)5.3 ± 0.1>10.0>10.09.5 ± 0.1>10.07.6 ± 0.1K0.5ADP (μm)83.6 ± 0.9NDNDNDNDNDKiADP (mm)2.1 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.12.5 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.1Residual activity at 4.5 mm ADP (%)038.4 ± 1.241.7 ± 0.133.1 ± 0.133.2 ± 0.521.9 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Finally, we combined mutations of the allosteric activating (N341A) and the inhibitory (R246A/K386A) sites in the triple mutant N341A/R246A/K386A. This mutant was also constitutively activated but with a lower extent (66% of maximum activity). The Ki values for ATP and ADP when compared with mutants of the inhibitory allosteric site alone were significantly decreased (Table 3, Fig. 4). Pfk activity underlies strong allosteric regulation by several effectors including adenine nucleotides. The crystal structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic Pfk revealed a number of adenine nucleotide molecules bound in the catalytic center as well as in allosteric binding sites (Fig. 1, A and B). In the crystal structure of rabbit skeletal muscle Pfk (13.Banaszak K. Mechin I. Obmolova G. Oldham M. Chang S.H. Ruiz T. Radermacher M. Kopperschläger G. Rypniewski W. The crystal structures of eukaryotic phosphofructokinases from bakers' yeast and rabbit skeletal muscle.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 407: 284-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), ADP was found in two binding sites (Fig. 1, C and D), which were different from the well characterized allosteric binding sites in prokaryotic Pfk (Fig. 1B). Because ADP can activate (at μm concentration) and also inactivate (at mm concentration) the enzyme, we approached the functional relevance of these two nucleotide binding sites by site-directed mutagenesis. In one crystal structure of the rabbit skeletal muscle Pfk, ATP was found in one of the two ADP binding sites (Fig. 1E), suggesting this as the inhibitory allosteric site; however, an experimental proof was missing. The single mutations of binding relevant residues in the potential activating binding site (N341A, S377A, K678A) shifted the K0.5 values of ADP to higher concentrations (Table 1). Increased K0.5 values of AMP were found for S377A/K678A and N341A (Table 1), strongly supporting annotation of this nucleotide binding site as the allosteric activating binding site for AMP and ADP. Interestingly, the K0.5 values for AMP were unchanged in the single mutants (S377A, K678A). This suggests that in contrast to ADP, where the diphosphate moiety of ADP is coordinated by Ser377 and Lys678 (Fig. 1C), binding of the monophosphate residue of AMP may involve additional or other residues. Only a crystal structure of muscle Pfk with AMP bound may clarify detailed coordination of this nucleotide in the activating allosteric site. Mutation of Asn341 was more efficient in increasing the K0.5 values of both ADP and AMP (Table 1). Because the backbone nitrogen atom of Asn341 interacts with the ribose of ADP, the side chain is probably involved in the transmission of the allosteric signal or necessary for the correct positioning of the backbone chain. Most strikingly, however, Ki values of ADP and ATP were significantly shifted toward lower concentrations, suggesting an increase of the effector affinity at the allosteric inhibitory binding site or an enhanced transduction of the inhibitory effect of ATP and ADP (Fig. 2, A and C). Single Ala mutations of His242, Arg246, and Lys386 and double mutation (R246A/K386A) in the putative inhibitory binding site reduced the inhibitory potency of ATP and ADP (Table 3), strongly supporting the postulated function as the inhibitory allosteric site. However, Pfk activity was almost at the maximum in the absence of the activator AMP or ADP (Fig. 4B), indicating constitutively activated mutant enzymes. The maximum activity of e.g. R246A/K386A was not significantly different from the wild type, and the specific activity of highly purified Ala mutants did not differ from the wild type enzyme under optimal conditions excluding gross structural changes in the mutants. It appears that mutations of the inhibitory allosteric site “locked” the enzyme in an active conformation mimicking the state in the presence of AMP. This is supported by the fact that Fru-6-P dependence of the Ala mutants (H242A, R246A, K386A) presented a Michaelis-Menten kinetic indicating a lack of cooperativity. However, additional mutation on the activating allosteric site (N341A/R246A/K386A) did not reverse this constitutively activated conformation but improved ATP inhibition when compared with R246A/K386A (Fig. 4, A and B). This indicates a more complex interplay of the allosteric sites or several (dissociable) active states. From recent studies, we know that the smallest active enzyme form of mammalian Pfk consists of four subunits but that higher oligomeric complexes exist that are also functional (23.Ferreras C. Hernández E.D. Martínez-Costa O.H. Aragón J.J. Subunit interactions and composition of the fructose 6-phosphate catalytic site and the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate allosteric site of mammalian phosphofructokinase.J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 467: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Physiologically, AMP and μm concentration of ADP promote enzyme activation, and mm concentrations of ADP and ATP promote enzyme inhibition. This allosteric regulation directly couples cellular energy metabolism to cellular ATP/AMP ratio. Our data now suggest that this ATP/AMP-driven allostery is further fine-tuned by a reciprocal linkage of the two functionally opposed allosteric sites. Mutation of the activating allosteric site reduces the activating effect of AMP and ADP and synergistically increases the inhibitory effect of ATP and ADP. Vice versa, mutation of the inhibitory allosteric site increases Ki values of ATP and ADP and results in a constitutively activated enzyme. One may speculate that mutation or ligand occupation of one allosteric site leads to structural changes followed by changes in the affinity of the opposite allosteric site. For example, occupation of the allosteric activator site by AMP in the wild type Pfk decreases the affinity of ATP at the allosteric inhibitory site. Indeed, early studies with the skeletal muscle Pfk showed that the binding of AMP resulted in an antagonism of ATP inhibition by decreasing the affinity of ATP binding (25.Kemp R.G. Krebs E.G. Binding of metabolites by phosphofructokinase.Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Further evidence for such a mechanistic explanation comes from the crystal structures of the prokaryotic Pfk from E. coli. In the inactive state, the AMP binding site is structurally different when compared with the active state (10.Schirmer T. Evans P.R. Structural basis of the allosteric behavior of phosphofructokinase.Nature. 1990; 343: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of eukaryotic Pfk clearly showed that the allosteric nucleotide binding sites are different from those in the prokaryotic Pfk (13.Banaszak K. Mechin I. Obmolova G. Oldham M. Chang S.H. Ruiz T. Radermacher M. Kopperschläger G. Rypniewski W. The crystal structures of eukaryotic phosphofructokinases from bakers' yeast and rabbit skeletal muscle.J. Mol.

Molecular architecture and structural basis of allosteric regulation of eukaryotic phosphofructokinases.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, reciprocal linkage of functionally opposed allosteric binding sites must have developed independently in prokaryotic and eukaryotic Pfk, giving an impressive example of convergent evolution at the molecular level. Although a reciprocal linkage of functionally opposite allosteric binding sites is in agreement with the extended Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allostery (26.Changeux J.P. Allostery and the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model after 50 years.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2012; 41: 83-113Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar), this allostery model has been shown inappropriate in a certain number of cases. For prokaryotic Pfk, the classical two-state model is not sufficient to describe the allosteric behavior (27.Fenton A.W. Reinhart G.D. Disentangling the web of allosteric communication in a homotetramer: heterotropic inhibition in phosphofructokinase from Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), so additional models of allostery were developed (26.Changeux J.P. Allostery and the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model after 50 years.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2012; 41: 83-113Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 27.Fenton A.W. Reinhart G.D.

Because mammalian Pfk are even more complex (in terms of structure and regulation) than prokaryotic Pfk, the appropriate crystal structures of the various states are required to clarify whether the functionally opposed allosteric sites are linked within a subunit or between subunits. In sum, we assigned two new allosteric adenine nucleotide binding sites to be the activating and inhibitory nucleotide binding sites. The latter is occupied by ATP or ADP. The novel ADP binding site found in the crystal structure of mammalian Pfk is the activating allosteric site and also binds AMP. Our data strongly support that activating and inhibitory allosteric binding sites do not only regulate the catalytic Pfk activity but also modulate the properties of each other in a reciprocal manner. This cross-talk between the allosteric nucleotide binding sites may further fine-tune Pfk activity depending on the ATP/AMP ratio.

https://openalex.org/W2005664155,"The enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is rapidly and transiently up-regulated by a large variety of signals and implicated in pathologies such as inflammation and tumorigenesis. Although many signals cause COX-2 up-regulation, much less is known about mechanisms that actively down-regulate its expression. Here we show that the G protein-coupled receptor prostaglandin E(1) (EP(1)) reduces the expression of COX-2 in a concentration-dependent manner through a mechanism that does not require receptor activation. The reduction in COX-2 protein is not due to decreased protein synthesis and occurs because of enhancement of substrate-independent COX-2 proteolysis. Although EP(1) does not interfere with the entry of COX-2 into the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation cascade, it facilitates COX-2 ubiquitination through complex formation. Blockade of proteasomal activity results in degradation of the receptor and concomitant recovery in the expression of COX-2, suggesting that EP(1) may scaffold an unknown E3 ligase that ubiquitinates COX-2. These findings propose a new role for the EP(1) receptor in resolving inflammation through down-regulation of COX-2."

https://openalex.org/W2038012279,"Bacterial proton-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-1) consists of a peripheral and a membrane domain. The peripheral domain catalyzes the electron transfer from NADH to quinone through a chain of seven iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters. Subunit NuoI in the peripheral domain contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters (N6a and N6b) and plays a role in bridging the electron transfer from cluster N5 to the terminal cluster N2. We constructed mutants for eight individual Cys-coordinating Fe/S clusters. With the exception of C63S, all mutants had damaged architecture of NDH-1, suggesting that Cys-coordinating Fe/S clusters help maintain the NDH-1 structure. Studies of three mutants (C63S-coordinating N6a, P110A located near N6a, and P71A in the vicinity of N6b) were carried out using EPR measurement. These three mutations did not affect the EPR signals from [2Fe-2S] clusters and retained electron transfer activities. Signals at g(z) = 2.09 disappeared in C63S and P110A but not in P71A. Considering our data together with the available information, g(z,x) = 2.09, 1.88 signals are assigned to cluster N6a. It is of interest that, in terms of g(z,x) values, cluster N6a is similar to cluster N4. In addition, we investigated the residues (Ile-94 and Ile-100) that are predicted to serve as electron wires between N6a and N6b and between N6b and N2, respectively. Replacement of Ile-100 and Ile-94 with Ala/Gly did not affect the electron transfer activity significantly. It is concluded that conserved Ile-100 and Ile-94 are not essential for the electron transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2066753238,"Paired immunoglobulin-like receptors beta, PILRβ, and alpha, PILRα, are related to the Siglec family of receptors and are expressed primarily on cells of the myeloid lineage. PILRβ is a DAP12 binding partner expressed on both human and mouse myeloid cells. The potential ligand, CD99, is found on many cell types, such as epithelial cells where it plays a role in migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation. Pilrb deficient mice were challenged with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii in two different models of infection induced inflammation; one involving the establishment of chronic encephalitis and a second mimicking inflammatory bowel disease in order to understand the potential role of this receptor in persistent inflammatory responses. It was found that in the absence of activating signals from PILRβ, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) produced increased amounts of IL-27, p28 and promoted IL-10 production in effector T cells. The sustained production of IL-27 led ultimately to enhanced survival after challenge due to dampened immune pathology in the gut. Similar protection was also observed in the CNS during chronic T. gondii infection after i.p. challenge again providing evidence that PILRβ is important for regulating aberrant inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2055722809,"Robust elevation of the cytosolic calcium concentration is a crucial early step for T cell activation triggered by the T cell antigen receptor. Vav1 is a proto-oncogene expressed in hematopoietic cells that is indispensable for transducing the calcium-mobilizing signal. Following T cell receptor stimulation, Vav1 facilitates formation of signaling microclusters through multiple interactions with other proteins participating in the signaling cascade. Truncation of the N terminus of Vav1 produces its oncogenic version, which is unable to support normal calcium flux following T cell activation. We show here that truncation of the N-terminal region of Vav1 alters the fine structure of protein complexes in the signaling clusters, affecting the interaction of Vav1 with phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1). This alteration is accompanied by a decrease in PLCγ1 phosphorylation and inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. We suggest that the structural integrity of the N-terminal region of Vav1 is important for the proper formation of the Vav1-associated signaling complexes. The oncogenic truncation of this region elicits conformational changes that interfere with the Vav1-mediated activation of PLCγ1 and that inhibit calcium mobilization."

Therefore, precise fine-tuning of IL-2 expression is crucial for adjusting the immune response. Combining transcription factor analysis at the single cell and the single nucleus level using flow cytometry with statistical analysis, we showed that physiological differences in the expression levels of c-Fos and NFATc2, but not of c-Jun and NF-κBp65, are limiting for the decision whether IL-2 is expressed in a strongly activated human memory T-helper (Th) cell. Variation in the expression of c-Fos leads to substantial diversity of IL-2 expression in ∼40% of the memory Th cells. The remaining cells exhibit an equally high c-Fos expression level, thereby ensuring robustness in IL-2 response within the population. These findings reveal how memory Th cells benefit from regulated variation in transcription factor expression to achieve a certain stability and variability of cytokine expression in a controlled manner."
