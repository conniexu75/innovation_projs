https://openalex.org/W2119986263,"Six ice cores from Kilimanjaro provide an approximately 11.7-thousand-year record of Holocene climate and environmental variability for eastern equatorial Africa, including three periods of abrupt climate change: approximately 8.3, approximately 5.2, and approximately 4 thousand years ago (ka). The latter is coincident with the ""First Dark Age,"" the period of the greatest historically recorded drought in tropical Africa. Variable deposition of F- and Na+ during the African Humid Period suggests rapidly fluctuating lake levels between approximately 11.7 and 4 ka. Over the 20th century, the areal extent of Kilimanjaro's ice fields has decreased approximately 80%, and if current climatological conditions persist, the remaining ice fields are likely to disappear between 2015 and 2020."
https://openalex.org/W2003721128,"Silaffins are uniquely modified peptides that have been implicated in the biogenesis of diatom biosilica. A method that avoids the harsh anhydrous hydrogen fluoride treatment commonly used to dissolve biosilica allows the extraction of silaffins in their native state. The native silaffins carry further posttranslational modifications in addition to their polyamine moieties. Each serine residue was phosphorylated, and this high level of phosphorylation is essential for biological activity. The zwitterionic structure of native silaffins enables the formation of supramolecular assemblies. Time-resolved analysis of silica morphogenesis in vitro detected a plastic silaffin-silica phase, which may represent a building material for diatom biosilica."
https://openalex.org/W2077404304,"Changes in prion protein (PrP) folding are associated with fatal neurodegenerative disorders, but the neurotoxic species is unknown. Like other proteins that traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum, misfolded PrP is retrograde transported to the cytosol for degradation by proteasomes. Accumulation of even small amounts of cytosolic PrP was strongly neurotoxic in cultured cells and transgenic mice. Mice developed normally but acquired severe ataxia, with cerebellar degeneration and gliosis. This establishes a mechanism for converting wild-type PrP to a highly neurotoxic species that is distinct from the self-propagating PrP(Sc) isoform and suggests a potential common framework for seemingly diverse PrP neurodegenerative disorders."

They are now known to have broader activities, including those that favor tumor growth. We addressed whether and which chemokines may be important promoters of the growth of the incurable brain neoplasm, malignant gliomas. Analyses of 16 human glioma lines for the expression of chemokine receptors belonging to the CXCR and CCR series revealed low to negligible levels of all receptors, with the exception of CXCR4 that was expressed by 13 of 16 lines. All six resected human glioma specimens showed similarly high CXCR4 expression. The CXCR4 on glioma lines is a signaling receptor in that its agonist, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1; CXCL12), produced rapid phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, SDF-1 induced the phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B), a kinase associated with survival, and prevented the apoptosis of glioma cells when serum was withdrawn from the culture medium. SDF-1 also mediated glioma chemotaxis, in accordance with this better known role of chemokines. We conclude that glioma cells express a predominant chemokine receptor, CXCR4, and that this functions to regulate survival in part through activating pathways such as Akt.

We conclude that glioma cells express a predominant chemokine receptor, CXCR4, and that this functions to regulate survival in part through activating pathways such as Akt. Chemokines are a family of molecules that regulate the chemotaxis of leukocytes in tissues (1Moser B. Loetscher P. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Chemokines have other roles, including promoting mitosis and the modulation of apoptosis, survival, and angiogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 2Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). These functions are beneficial for tumor growth, and it is now appreciated that chemokines are expressed by many tumor types. Indeed, several chemokines have been purified and characterized from tumor sources (3Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Barrett J. Rollins M.D. Chemokines and Cancer. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 51-69Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, it was discovered that the ability of breast cancer cells to metastasize to particular tissues was the result of the expression of a specific chemokine receptor, CXCR4, on breast cancer cells; coordinately, its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α 1The abbreviations used are: SDF, stromal cell-derived factor; CNS, central nervous system; IL, interleukin; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; FCS, fetal calf serum; RPA, RNase protection assay; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CXCL12) was expressed in target tissues (4Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4502) Google Scholar). The SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway has also been implicated in the metastasis of prostate cancer cells to bone (5Taichman R.S. Cooper C. Keller E.T. Pienta K.J. Taichman N.S. McCauley L.K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1832-1837PubMed Google Scholar). The chemokine family now consists of over 40 members that are subdivided into groups based on the motifs of their first two N terminus cysteine residues (6Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar, 7Proudfoot A.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The CXC chemokines have an amino acid separating the first two cysteine residues whereas the CC chemokines do not. The CX3C subgroup, with three intervening amino acids, has a single member, as does the C subfamily with one cysteine residue at the N terminus. Chemokines bind to G protein-coupled receptors that are segregated based on the chemokine subgrouping (CXCRs, CCRs, CX3R1, XCR1). Malignant gliomas are brain neoplasms that account for more than 50% of tumors that arise within the central nervous system (CNS). They are highly proliferative and angiogenic and are locally very invasive within the CNS. The median survival of patients with malignant glioma is less than 1 year, and only 2% survive beyond 3 years (8Scott J.N. Rewcastle N.B. Brasher P.M. Fulton D. MacKinnon J.A. Hamilton M. Carincross J.G. Forsyth P. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A better understanding of glioma biology to derive effective therapeutics for this incurable neoplasm is indicated clearly. Several chemokines have now been described on glioma cells in situ and in vitro, and these include macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2) (9Yoshimura T. Kuratsu J. Chemokines and Cancer. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 227-241Crossref Google Scholar, 10Oh J.W. Schwiebert L.M. Benveniste E.N. J. Neurovirol. 1999; 5: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Leung S.Y.

Shin M.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3117-3124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and SDF-1 (CXCL12) (15Rempel S.A. Dudas S. Ge S. Gutierrez J.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 102-111PubMed Google Scholar). The function of these proteins in glioma biology remains uncertain, but they could account for the increased malignancy of glioma cells. For example, a role for chemokines in regulating angiogenesis is suggested by the observation that hypoxic/anoxic insults to glioma cells in vitro induced an increase in IL-8 mRNA (16Desbaillets I. Diserens A.C. Tribolet N. Hamou M.F. Van Meir E.G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1201-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Also, SDF-1 and CXCR4 are co-localized to regions of angiogenesis in glioma specimens in situ (15Rempel S.A. Dudas S. Ge S. Gutierrez J.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 102-111PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand whether and which chemokines may be important promoters of the growth of glioma cells, we have performed a systematic analysis of the chemokine receptors that may be over-represented in the majority of glioma cell lines. Furthermore, we examined biochemical signaling pathways that could be triggered by such chemokine receptors. Our results reveal the predominance of expression of CXCR4, and we further demonstrate that its ligand, SDF-1, activated MAP kinases and Akt and is a survival and chemotactic factor for glioma cells in vitro. The human glioma cell lines U251N, U373, and U87 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and have been described elsewhere (17Couldwell W.T. Uhm J.H. Antel J.P. Yong V.W. Neurosurgery. 1991; 29: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Lines LN18, LN71, LN215, LN229, LN308, LN340, LN405, LN427, LN428, LN443, LN464, LN827 and LN992 (18Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Erwin Van Meir (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Cells were maintained in feeding medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) as described previously (19Besson A. Yong V.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4580-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of astrocytes (over 95% pure) and neurons (purity of 90% or higher) were isolated from the brains of human fetuses as detailed before (20Vecil G.G. Larsen P.H. Corley S.M. Herx L.M. Besson A. Goodyer C.G. Yong V.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The use of these therapeutic abortion specimens has been approved by local institutional human ethics committees. Glioma samples were kindly provided by the London (Ontario) Brain Tumor Tissue Bank in the London Health Sciences Center. The six cases used in this study were diagnosed histologically as glioblastoma multiform (World Health Organization Grade IV). Cells at 80% confluence in 100-mm-diameter dishes were harvested by applying 1 ml of Trizol® (Invitrogen) per dish. Total RNA was extracted, and 15 μg was used for each RPA. Multiprobe template sets for chemokine receptors (hCR-5, hCR-6) were obtained from Pharmingen (RiboQuant™). The method for RPA was as detailed by the manufacturer. In another series of experiments, cell lines were treated with IL-1β (2 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; 100 units/ml), or their combination for 18 h, and cells were then harvested for RPA. Cells at 80% confluence were scraped off 100-mm dishes using a rubber policeman, stained with a monoclonal anti-human CXCR4-fluorescein isothiocyanate (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 45 min, washed, fixed, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Alternatively, 10,000 cells were plated onto glass coverslips and were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to CXCR4 (clone 44708.111; R&D Systems) a day later. Following the application of goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to Cy3 and fixation, coverslips were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. To determine whether CXCR4 on glioma cell lines was functionally active, glioma cells were treated with SDF-1α (20 ng/ml) for 15, 30, or 60 min. Lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and complemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was then added. The lysate was collected, freeze-thawed twice, and spun at 10,000 rpm in a microfuge for 5 min. The supernatant was analyzed for total protein content using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Fifty μg of total protein was added to each lane of a 12.5% SDS-PAGE and resolved. Proteins were transferred on to an ImmobilonTM membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA), which was then blocked for nonspecific binding (using phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 10% milk). A primary antibody to the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) (either rabbit anti-ERK (1:1000) or rabbit anti-phosphorylated ERK (1:1000); New England Biolabs) was then applied overnight at 4 °C. A secondary antibody of anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) was then added at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then probed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL Western blotting detection system; Amersham Biosciences). In other experiments, cell lysates were probed for the activation of Akt/protein kinase B, a kinase that down-regulates apoptosis by phosphorylating various substrates including caspase-9 and forkhead transcription factors. The antibodies utilized were rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) and rabbit anti-Akt (both from New England Biolabs). 50,000 glioma cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate. The amount of SDF-1 secreted into the medium after 48 h of culture was analyzed using 100 μl of cell-conditioned medium. In other experiments, media was collected 72 h after treatment with IL-1β or from untreated cultures. SDF-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was analyzed as described by the manufacturer (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells plated into 6-well set-up were fed with 1.5 ml of feeding medium. Cell-conditioned medium was collected from control or SDF-1-treated cultures 24 h later and was analyzed for MMP-2 content by gelatin zymography as described previously (21Uhm J.H. Dooley N.P. Villemure J.G. Yong V.W. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our focus was on MMP-2 as this is the predominant gelatinase that is expressed by glioma cell lines (21Uhm J.H. Dooley N.P. Villemure J.G. Yong V.W. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To address whether SDF-1 affects the two-dimensional motility of glioma cells, 100,000 cells were plated onto 12-mm-diameter glass coverslips to rapidly obtain a very confluent monolayer of cells. One day later, a rubber policeman was used to scrape cells off from half the coverslip. The distance that remaining cells migrated across the scratch line was then assessed 48 h later. The initial confluent monolayer allowed a reliable evaluation of where the scratch line (point of origin of migration) was (22Besson A. Davy A. Robbins S.M. Yong V.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7398-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After 48 h of migration, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with hematoxylin overnight. Cells were then photographed using a 40× objective, imported via a CCD camera into Image-Pro software, and the distance that cells have migrated was then measured on printouts in cm. In another series of experiments, the ability of SDF-1 to alter the invasiveness of glioma cells was addressed using a Boyden chamber coated with a barrier of the extracellular matrix protein mixture, matrigel, as described earlier (21Uhm J.H. Dooley N.P. Villemure J.G. Yong V.W. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We utilized a 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) to address whether SDF-1 had chemotactic activity for glioma cells. SDF-1 (100 ng/ml) was added into the lower chamber, and the target cells, LN827, were added into the upper chamber (5000 cells in 50 μl of medium). The upper and lower chambers were separated by a polycarbonate filter (8-μm pore; polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-free). The filled chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h after which the cells that had not traversed into the lower chamber were scrapped off. The filter was fixed in acid alcohol (5% acetic acid, 95% ethanol) for 15 min, and the cells were stained with hematoxylin. The migrated cells were then counted using a microscope. 10,000 cells plated onto glass coverslips were incubated with test agents for 24 h; 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added during the last hour. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol and stained for nuclear incorporation of BrdUrd as described previously (23Yong V.W. Kim S.U. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 21: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This was followed by counter staining for 3 min with the DNA binding Hoescht dye (Hoescht 33852; Sigma) to label all cells. Using an immunofluorescence microscope, the number of Hoescht-positive cells was counted per field to obtain the total number of cells in that field. Of these, the number of cells that were BrdUrd-positive was evaluated to obtain the percentage of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. A nucleosome enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Diagnostics) was used to determine cell death in response to serum deprivation. The method relies on the detection of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) that are generated in apoptotic cells. 10,000 cells were placed into each well of a 96-well plate. Cells were plated in feeding medium containing 10% FCS. 4–5 h later, when the majority of cells had adhered, the medium for most experimental groups was changed over to an identical one, except that this contained 0.1% FCS. Some cells continued to be maintained in 10% FCS. In wells that were kept in the 0.1% FCS, SDF-1 was applied to specified groups. Two days later, the cell lysate was collected, and the amount of cell death was evaluated using the nucleosome assay as described in detail by the manufacturer. When two groups were compared, the unpaired Student's t test was applied. When multiple groups were evaluated, the one-way analysis of variance test with post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons was used. Statistical significance was set atp < 0.05. Sixteen human glioma cell lines were analyzed for the expression of chemokine receptors using RPA. Of the CXCR series, CXCR4 was expressed by 13 of 16 lines, albeit at low levels in some lines (e.g. lines 8 and 12) (Fig.1). CXCR1 and CXCR2 were detectable in a minority of lines (numbers 7, 9, 12, 15, and 16), whereas CXCR3 was undetectable in all samples. Of the CCR series (1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5, and 8), except for low CCR1 expression by 4 of 16 lines, these were uniformly absent in gliomas (data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the CXCR4 receptor is a major chemokine receptor expressed by glioma cells in culture. Six glioblastoma specimens were analyzed, and the predominant expression of CXCR4 was also noted in these samples (Fig.2). Subsequent experiments therefore focused on glioma lines to elucidate the biology of CXCR4 in gliomas. A potent stimulus of the expression of chemokines or their receptors is inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1 and TNF-α (10Oh J.W. Schwiebert L.M. Benveniste E.N. J. Neurovirol. 1999; 5: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because glioma cells in situ are in close contact with microglia (24Klein R. Roggendorf W. Acta Neuropathol. (Berlin). 2001; 101: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which are principal sources of IL-1 and TNF-α in the CNS (25Herx L.M. Rivest S. Yong V.W. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether these cytokines, or their combination, could alter the profile of chemokine receptor expression by glioma cells in vitro. Fig. 3 reveals that treatment with IL-1β and TNF-α, alone or in combination, did not alter the profile of chemokine receptor expression. Thus, IL-1β or TNF-α did not elevate CXCR4 transcript levels in lines (LN827, LN427, and LN992) that express CXCR4 under basal culture conditions and did not induce CXCR4 in a line that is without CXCR4 basally (LN229). Similarly, cytokine treatment did not promote the expression of CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR3 in all four lines tested (Fig. 3). The virtual absence of the CCR series was not up-regulated by IL-1β and/or TNF-α treatment (data not shown). To confirm that the transcripts encoding CXCR4 were translated into receptor protein expression, the LN827 line was analyzed by flow cytometry following staining for the CXCR4 receptor. Fig.4 indicates that although the CXCR4 receptor expression at the level of protein tended to be low, this was definitively present on the LN827 line. The expression of CXCR4 protein was also confirmed by cell surface immunofluorescence microscopy analysis (Fig. 4). In summary, of the multitude of chemokine receptors that were analyzed, the majority of glioma cell lines express a major subtype, CXCR4. This and other receptors were not up-regulated by IL-1β or TNF-α. To evaluate whether the presence of CXCR4 on glioma cells contributes to the phenotype of glioma cells, it was necessary to demonstrate that the receptor was functional. The only ligand that is known currently for the CXCR4 receptor is SDF-1. Thus, glioma cells lines were treated with SDF-1α and harvested 15, 30, and 60 min thereafter to evaluate whether cellular activation had occurred. Because SDF-1α is known to activate the ERK pathway (26Oh J.W. Drabik K. Kutsch O. Choi C. Tousson A. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2695-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), cell lysates were investigated for the phosphorylation of ERKs. Fig. 5demonstrates that shortly after the addition of SDF-1α, whereas the total amount of ERKs (p42 and p44 MAP kinase) remained unchanged, there was a rapid induction of ERK phosphorylation. Thus, the CXCR4 receptor on glioma cell lines is a signaling receptor. Glioma cells have a propensity to produce autocrine factors for their own growth and survival. We evaluated whether SDF-1 was produced by glioma cells to interact with their CXCR4 receptors for autocrine functions. Because SDF-1 is a secreted product, we measured the cell-conditioned medium for the amount of this protein. Non-transformed astrocytes were also used, as these are known sources of SDF-1 (27Ohtani Y. Minami M. Kawaguchi N. Nishiyori A. Yamamoto J. Takami S. Satoh M. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 249: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 reveals that the LN427 and U251N lines secreted minimal amounts of SDF-1 under basal culture condition, and this was not further up-regulated by treatment with IL-1β. Two other lines, U87 and U373, had similarly minimal SDF-1 levels under basal or cytokine-stimulated conditions (data not shown). In the case of the LN827 line, some SDF-1 was detected in basal culture, and this was up-regulated in response to IL-1β. Notably, the amount of SDF-1 in cytokine-treated LN827 culture was similar to that produced in astrocytes under basal culture condition. The amount of SDF-1 produced by astrocytes was further up-regulated by IL-1β. Neurons, in contrast to astrocytes, did not produce SDF-1 under the conditions tested. That most CXCR4-bearing glioma lines do not produce detectable SDF-1 levels indicates the absence of an autocrine loop involving these molecules. Rather, it appears possible that the non-transformed glial environment, particularly that provided by astrocytes, is a good source of SDF-1 that activates CXCR4 on glioma cells. To investigate the functional significance of CXCR4 on glioma cells, we focused on the LN827 line and treated its cells with SDF-1α to determine whether a specific phenotype would manifest. It should be noted that all results were reproduced in another glioma line, LN427 (data not shown). Fig.7 A demonstrates that the amount of MMP-2 did not increase following treatment with SDF-1α. In correspondence, the number of cells that transmigrated across matrigel, an indicator of invasiveness that is linked to MMP-2 levels (21Uhm J.H. Dooley N.P. Villemure J.G. Yong V.W. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), was not different between SDF-1α-treated cells and controls (Fig.7 B). The mechanisms underlying the invasiveness of cells across matrigel include the degradation of matrigel and associated protease activity (28Yong V.W. Power C. Forsyth P. Edwards D.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). These are related but distinct from those that regulate the motility of cells in a two-dimensional manner. The latter involves the formation of focal adhesion complexes and the activation of signaling receptors such as integrins (22Besson A. Davy A. Robbins S.M. Yong V.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7398-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 30Aplin A.E. Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, we used a scratch assay to evaluate whether SDF-1α could regulate the motility of glioma cells. Upon the removal, by scratching, of half a monolayer of cells on coverslips, the cells in the remaining half monolayer migrated promptly across into the barren substratum (22Besson A. Davy A. Robbins S.M. Yong V.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7398-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte growth factor increased the distance that remaining cells migrated across the scratch line in comparison to controls (Fig. 7 C), in concordance with the reports that hepatocyte growth factor is a motility factor for glioma cells (31Moriyama T. Kataoka H. Seguchi K. Tsubouchi H. Koono M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 678-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Cao B. Su Y. Oskarsson M. Zhao P. Kort E.J. Fisher R.J. Wang L.M. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7443-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In contrast, SDF-1α did not increase their motility (Fig. 7 C). Although SDF-1 applied directly to glioma cells did not increase their motility in a two-dimensional assay, it did not exclude the possibility that SDF-1 would act as a chemotactic factor if introduced as a gradient for glioma cells to migrate toward. Thus, we used a conventional chemotaxis assay where SDF-1α added to the lower chamber was used to attract glioma cells seeded onto the upper chamber; such an assay did not contain extracellular matrix barriers to avoid the need for proteases for invasion. Under these conditions, SDF-1α was chemotactic for the migration of glioma cells (Fig.8 A). Finally, we addressed whether SDF-1α modulates glioma cell proliferation by examining the proportion of cells that incorporated BrdUrd. Although an average of 28% of control LN827 glioma cells incorporated BrdUrd over 1 h, the treatment of glioma cells with SDF-1α for 24 h did not increase the proportion of glioma cells with BrdUrd (Fig. 7 D). Thus, SDF-1α did not regulate glioma cell proliferation. Collectively, these results indicate that signaling through CXCR4 on glioma cells does not regulate glioma motility, invasiveness, and their cell cycle; however, SDF-1α enabled chemotaxis of glioma cells, demonstrating that CXCR4 functions to sense this chemokine for glioma cells to migrate toward. An important determinant of tumorigenic potential is the ability of transformed cells to regulate their survival. We addressed whether SDF-1α could alter cell death following the deprivation of FCS, and its attendant growth factors, from glioma cell medium. Although glioma cells are known to produce a variety of autocrine survival factors, many cells do undergo apoptosis when deprived of the rich growth conditions afforded by 10% FCS in the culture medium, as noted in Fig. 8 B. Interestingly, the addition of SDF-1α to the cultures upon FCS removal attenuated cell death. Indeed, the level of apoptosis in SDF-1α (10 and 50 ng/ml)-treated cultures was similar to the low level that was found in 10% FCS medium (Fig. 8 B). To support these results, there were noticeably less glioma cells present in serum-free medium in the absence of SDF-1α than in its presence (data not shown). Thus, SDF-1α is a survival factor for glioma cells. In support, SDF-1α induced a prolonged activation of the survival kinase, Akt, in glioma cells (Fig. 9). Chemokines have been investigated extensively in the context of providing migratory and directional cues for the trafficking of leukocytes. However, these molecules also regulate other important cellular functions such as survival, granule exocytosis, angiogenesis, cell cycle progression, growth, and cell-cell interaction (2Gerard C.

Indeed, several chemokines and their receptor pairs are found on different neural cell types, where they are thought to provide for intercellular communication between neurons and glia (reviewed in Ref. 37Asensio V.C. Campbell I.L. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 504-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This is exemplified in the case of fractalkine (CX3CL1), which has been localized to neurons, whereas its receptor, CX3CR1, has been localized in on microglia (38Nishiyori A. Minami M. Ohtani Y.

The mechanism for initiating PrPSc formation is unknown. We report that PrP retrogradely transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum produced both amorphous aggregates and a PrPSc-like conformation in the cytosol. The distribution between these forms correlated with the rate of appearance in the cytosol. Once conversion to the PrPSc-like conformation occurred, it was sustained. Thus, PrP has an inherent capacity to promote its own conformational conversion in mammalian cells. These observations might explain the origin of PrPSc."

We constructed model grassland systems in the Ecotron controlled environment facility and manipulated soil community composition through assemblages of different animal body sizes.

However, two key ecosystem processes, aboveground net primary productivity and net ecosystem productivity, were surprisingly resistant to these changes.

A superconducting critical temperature (Tc) is found ranging from 9 to 16 kelvin at 23 to 80 gigapascals.

https://openalex.org/W1982137838,"DNA damage leads to stabilization and accumulation of p53, which plays a pivotal role in transcriptional activation of p21 and cell cycle arrest. The increase in p53 stability depends critically on its phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues, including those preceding a proline (Ser(P)/Thr-Pro). The Ser(P)/Thr-Pro moiety exists in the two distinct cis and trans conformations and their conversion is catalyzed specifically by the prolyl isomerase Pin1. Pin1 regulates the conformation and function of certain phosphorylated proteins and plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, oncogenesis, and Alzheimer's disease. However, nothing is known about the role of Pin1 in DNA damage. Here we found that DNA damage enhanced the interaction between Pin1 and p53, which depended on the WW domain in Pin1 and Ser33/46-Pro motifs in p53. Furthermore, Pin1 regulates the stability of p53 and its transcriptional activity toward the p21 promoter. As a result, p53 and p21 barely increased after DNA damage in Pin1 knock-out embryonic fibroblasts or in neoplastic cells depleted of Pin1. Moreover, Pin1 null cells displayed significant defects in cell cycle checkpoints induced by DNA damage. These results demonstrate a new role of Pin1 in regulating p53 function during DNA damage.

However, it is not clear whether the stability and/or function of p53 are regulated after Pro-directed phosphorylation.

The WW domain binds specific Ser(P)/Thr-Pro motifs and targets Pin1 to a subset of phosphoproteins where the PPIase domain induces conformational changes by isomerizing specific Ser(P)/Thr-Pro bonds. Such conformational changes have profound effects on catalytic activity, dephosphorylation, protein-protein interactions, subcellular location, and/or stability of Pin1 substrates (10–22).

Ryo A. Wulf G.G. Lee S.W. Niu T. Lu K.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3459-3472Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at 24 h after irradiation, followed by flow cytometric analysis in a FACScan (Becton Dickinson), as described (11Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T.

DNA damage induces phosphorylation of p53 on several Ser/Thr sites, including Ser33-Pro and Ser46-Pro motifs, and these phosphorylation sites are important for p53 function (1Wahl G.M. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E277-EE86Google Scholar, 7Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Google Scholar, 8Bulavin D.V.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2464-2472Google Scholar). Moreover, Ser33 and Ser46 have multiple upstream hydrophobic residues (Leu, Val, and/or Met) and are preceded by a Pro residue, the two most critical features for Pin1 preferred binding sites (12Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that Pin1 might bind p53 and regulate its function following DNA damage. To test this possibility, we first asked whether Pin1 binds p53 using GST-Pin1 pull-down analysis (15Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Google Scholar, 17Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Google Scholar, 20Wulf G.M. Ryo A. Wulf G.G. Lee S.W. Niu T. Lu K.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3459-3472Google Scholar). As shown previously (25Wosikowski K. Regis J.T. Robey R.W. Alvarez M. Buters J.T. Gudas J.M. Bates S.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1395-1403Google Scholar), when T47D human breast cancer cells, which contain wild-type p53 protein, were treated with 5 Gy of γ-radiation, p53 levels increased significantly within 6 h (Fig. 1A). More importantly, GST-Pin1, but not GST alone, pulled down p53 from mock-irradiated cells, and the binding was significantly increased after cells were irradiated (Fig. 1A), even after normalizing p53 loading (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, anti-p53 antibodies, but not control antibodies, immunoprecipitated endogenous Pin1, and this co-immunoprecipitation was also significantly increased by DNA damage (Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that DNA damage induces the interaction between Pin1 and p53. Next we tested whether the binding of Pin1 to p53 depends on the WW domain of Pin1 and the phosphorylation of p53 on specific Ser-Pro motifs. As indicated above, primary sequence analysis suggests that two potential Pin1-binding sites in p53 may be Ser33-Pro and Ser46-Pro motifs. We therefore used p53 single point mutants Ser33 → Ala or Ser46 → Ala as well as a double mutant Ser33 → Ala/Ser46 → Ala in Pin1 binding assays. These experiments were performed in HeLa cells because these cells express very little endogenous p53 protein (Fig. 1E), likely due to high levels of viral oncoprotein E6 (26Webster K. Parish J. Pandya M. Stern P.L. Clarke A.R. Gaston K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 87-94Google Scholar). To increase phosphorylation on Ser33 and Ser46, cell lysates were obtained 4 h after ionizing radiation with 5 Gy, at a time when Ser33 is shown to be significantly phosphorylated (7Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Google Scholar). A substantial amount of transfected wild-type p53 was pulled down by Pin1, but not by its mutant containing the Ser16 → Glu mutation (Fig. 1F). Given that the Ser16 → Glu mutation disrupts the ability of the Pin1 WW domain to bind phosphoproteins, these results confirm that Pin1 binds p53 via its WW domain. Furthermore, Pin1 binding to the Ser33 → Ala or Ser46 → Ala p53 single point mutant was considerably decreased, while no binding was detected between Pin1 and the Ser33 → Ala/Ser46 → Ala double mutant of p53 (Fig. 1F), indicating the requirement of both Ser residues for the binding. The above results indicate that DNA damage enhances the specific interaction between Pin1 and p53, and the binding depends on the WW domain in Pin1 as well as the Ser33 and Ser46 residues in p53. We next asked whether Pin1 affects p53 accumulation and p53-dependent responses after DNA damage. To address the first question, we used primary embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild-type (WT) or Pin1 knock-out (Pin1−/−) mice. The DNA damage-induced p53 accumulation was time- as well as dose-dependent in WT MEFs (Fig. 2,A and B). However, both the usual time- and dose-dependent increase in p53 levels in response to ionizing radiation was abolished in Pin1−/− MEFs (Fig. 2,A and B). These results indicate that p53 protein fails to increase in Pin1−/− MEFs. To further support that Pin1 is important for p53 accumulation following DNA damage, we depleted Pin1 from WT MEFs via expression of the Pin1 antisense construct (Pin1AS). Indeed, depletion of Pin1 from WT MEFs drastically suppressed induction of p53 after DNA damage (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that Pin1 is required for the accumulation of p53 after DNA damage. Next we examined the effects of Pin1 on p53 stability after DNA damage using a cycloheximide chase, as described (27Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Google Scholar). Pin1−/−MEFs were co-transfected with p53 and control vector, Pin1, or the S16E Pin1 mutant that failed to bind p53 (Fig. 1F). After irradiation, cycloheximide was added to inhibit de novo p53 synthesis and the steady-state levels of p53 were determined using antibodies that detected only transfected human p53 (Fig. 2,D and E). In Pin1−/− MEFs transfected with the control vector, the half-life of p53 was about 60 min (Fig. 2, D and E). Importantly, the half-life of p53 was significantly increased to ∼6 h by expression of Pin1. In contrast, the Pin1 mutant that failed to bind p53 did not have detectable effect on the p53 stability. To further support that phosphorylation-dependent association is important for Pin1 to stabilize p53, we examined the stability of the mutant S33A/S46A p53 mutant that failed to bind Pin1 (Fig. 1F). Pin1 stabilized p53, but not its mutant S33A/S46A mutant after DNA damage (Fig. 2, E and F). The above results indicate that Pin1 and its phosphorylation-dependent association is required for stabilization of p53 and also reveal an important new role of phosphorylation of Ser33 and Ser46 in regulating the stability of p53. We assayed the effects of Pin1 on p53-dependent responses. We first examined whether Pin1 affects p53-dependent p21 transactivation without DNA damage given the detectable, although weak, interaction (Fig. 1,A–D). As shown in Fig. 3A, Pin1 alone had a modest stimulatory effect on the p21 promoter activity. This stimulatory effect was significantly enhanced when co-transfected with p53, but was inhibited by dominant-negative p53 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, depletion of Pin1 by Pin1AS blocked the ability of p53 to activate the p21 promoter (Fig. 3A). Moreover, a mutation in the p53-binding site in the p21 promoter completely abolished the effects of Pin1 on the p21 promoter (Fig. 3B). These results show that Pin1 can enhance the ability of p53 to activate the p21 promoter. Since the Pin1 and p53 interaction is enhanced after DNA damage, we next examined the effects of irradiation on the ability of Pin1 to enhance the p21 promoter. As shown in Fig. 3B, irradiation increased p21 transactivation after transfection with Pin1 alone in comparison with vector control. However, p21 transactivation in response to irradiation was greatly enhanced when Pin1 and p53 were co-transfected (Fig. 3B). This stimulatory effect of Pin1 and p53 depended on DNA damage (Fig. 3B). Again, the mutation in the p53-binding site in the p21 promoter completely abolished the effects of Pin1 on the p21 promoter (Fig. 3B). Similarly, a dominant-negative p53 mutant suppressed the effects of Pin1 (Fig. 3B). Finally, the Pin1 point mutant that either could not bind p53 (Pin1S16E, Pin1W34A) or isomerize Ser(P)/Thr-Pro motifs (Pin1K63A) failed to increase p53 transactivation (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that Pin1 enhances the p53-dependent p21 transactivation upon DNA damage and that both the WW domain and the PPIase activity of Pin1 are required for this cooperation. If Pin1 enhances the p53-dependent p21 transactivation upon DNA damage, it would be expected that inhibition of Pin1 might affect the accumulation of p21 after DNA damage. p21 levels are strongly increased in WT MEFs after ionizing radiation, and this induction was time-dependent as well as dose-dependent (Fig. 2, A–C). However, under the same conditions, p21 levels failed to increase in Pin1−/− MEFs or WT MEFs that were depleted of Pin1 by Pin1AS (Fig. 2, A–C). Furthermore, both the time- and dose-dependent increases in p21 levels were abolished in Pin1−/− MEFs (Fig. 2,A and B). These results demonstrate that loss of Pin1 abolishes the accumulation of p53 and p21 after DNA damage. To examine whether Pin1 affects cell cycle checkpoint control in response to DNA damage. To address this question, we subjected WT or Pin1−/− MEFs to 5 Gy of γ irradiation. Before DNA damage, Pin1−/− cells had slightly more cells in G1 and fewer cells in S phase, as compared with WT cells (Fig. 4, A and B). This phenotype is consistent with the previous findings that Pin1 is an important regulator of the G1/S activator cyclin D1 (22Liou Y.C. Ryo R. Huang H.K. Lu P.J. Bronson R. Fujimori F. Uchidafl U. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1335-1340Google Scholar). Importantly, cell cycle profiles were observed after DNA damage. WT MEFs displayed interphase cell morphologies, whereas significantly more Pin1−/− MEFs were rounded up (data not shown). These differences were further confirmed by flow cytometrical analysis (Fig. 4). WT MEFs in S phase were dramatically reduced, and the majority of cells were accumulated with the 4n DNA content (Fig. 4). However, Pin1−/− MEFs in S phase were not changed. Furthermore, DNA damage-induced G2 arrest was significantly inhibited in Pin1−/− MEFs (Fig. 4). These results indicate that loss of Pin1 leads to multiple cell cycle checkpoint defects in response to DNA damage. Here we report that Pin1 plays an important role in regulating p53 function and in modulating cellular response to DNA damage. Pin1 bound p53 and also increased its protein stability, which depended on the binding of Pin1 to phosphorylated Ser33/46 of p53. Furthermore, Pin1 potentiated the transcriptional activity of p53 toward the p21 promoter. Moreover, p53 and p21 barely increased after ionizing radiation in Pin1−/− MEFs or in neoplastic cells depleted of Pin1. Finally, Pin1−/− MEFs displayed significant defects in cell cycle checkpoints induced by DNA damage. These results demonstrate that Pin1 is a novel regulator of p53 in DNA damage response. It remains to be determined how Pin1 regulates the ability of p53 and p21 to up-regulate during DNA damage. We have shown that the Pin1 binding or isomerase mutant fails to increase the stability and transactivation activity of p53. Furthermore, the S33A/S46A mutant that fails to bind Pin1 fails to be stabilized after DNA damage. These results strongly suggest for the first time that phosphorylation of Ser33 or Ser46 plays an important role in regulating the stabilization of p53. This is consistent with the fact that both residues lie in immediate vicinity of the Mdm2-binding site and affect transcriptional activity of p53 (5Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Google Scholar, 6Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Google Scholar, 28Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that when p53 is phosphorylated following DNA damage, Pin1 binds and isomerizes p53 on phosphorylated Ser33/46. This conformational change may prevent binding of p53 to its ubiquitin ligase MDM2, affect phosphorylation of p53 on other sites, and/or affect transcriptional activity of p53 toward p21. We are grateful to A. J. Fornace, Jr. for the p53 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2316858638,"Mammalian cells have a remarkable diverse repertoire of response to genotoxic stress that damage DNA. Cellular responses to DNA damaging agents will initially exhibit gene induction, which is regulated by complex mechanism(s) and probably involves multiple signaling pathways. In this paper, we demonstrate that induction of ATF3 protein, a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, by ionizing radiation (IR) requires normal cellular p53 function. In contrast, induction of ATF3 after UV radiation (UV) or Methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) is independent of p53 status. Induction of ATF3 by DNA damage is rapid, transient, and through a transcriptional mechanism. The ATF3 promoter is induced by UV and MMS, but not by IR. In addition, ATF3 promoter can be activated by MEKK1, an upstream activator of the ERK and JNK kinase pathway, but not induced following p53 expression. Those results indicate that regulation of ATF3 induction after DNA damage utilizes both the p53-dependent and -independent pathways, and may also involve MAP kinase signaling pathways. Using the tetracycline-inducible system (tet-off), we have found that over-expression of ATF3 protein moderately suppresses cell growth. Interestingly, over-expression of ATF3 protein is able to slow down progression of cells from G1 to S phase, indicating that ATF3 protein might play a negative role in the control of cell cycle progression."

We report here that nerve growth factor (NGF) leads to both a slow down-regulation of Bim expression in neuronal PC12 cells and rapid Bim phosphorylation. Both effects appear to be mediated by the MEK/MAPK pathway. An assay for Bim-mediated death revealed that NGF-promoted phosphorylation suppresses the proapoptotic activity of Bim. The phosphorylation sites responsible for this effect in the extra long form of rBim were identified as Ser-109 and Thr-110. Thus, NGF protects neurons from the proapoptotic effects of Bim both by acute phosphorylation and the longer term repression of expression.

Bcl-2 family members are major components of the apoptotic mechanism and are characterized by one or more of the four conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl2 homology; PI3 kinase (or PI3K), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; NGF, nerve growth factor; BimEL, Bim extra long isoform; BimL, Bim long isoform; Bim S, Bim short isoform; IL-3, interleukin-3; BAF, t-butoxycarbonyl-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; IL-3, interleukin 3 domains present in Bcl-2 (reviewed in Ref. 1Strasser A.

Some members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL promote cell survival, whereas others such as Bax, Bak, Bad, Bik, and Bim are proapoptotic. Among the proapoptotic species, a number (e.g. Bim, Bad and Bik) contain a single BH3 domain. These BH3-only proteins appear to play critical roles in cell death by both neutralizing prosurvival Bcl-2 family members and activating proapoptotic members of the family (2Bouillet P. Strasser A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One important mechanism by which the activity of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins is regulated is posttranslational modification. A well established example is phosphorylation of Bad by the PI3 kinase/AKT signaling pathway. Phosphorylated Bad is sequestered by binding to the 14-3-3 protein and is thereby unable to heterodimerize with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (3Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J.

Bik, Hrk, and PUMA are examples of BH3-only proteins that are induced in apoptotic paradigms (6Mathai J.P. Germain M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C.

Bim was isolated by an expression screen for Bcl-2-binding proteins (9O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). There are three major isoforms, designated BimEL, BimL, and BimS, which are probably generated by alternative splicing. All isoforms promote apoptosis, with the shortest (BimS) being the most potent (9O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Bim is expressed in hematopoietic, epithelial, neuronal, and germ cells (10O'Reilly L.A. Cullen L. Visvade J. Lindeman G.J.

Strasser A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the nervous system, Bim appears to influence neuronal apoptosis. Both induced and developmental deaths are delayed in brain and peripheral neurons of Bim null mice (11Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Moreover, BimEL is rapidly induced in NGF-deprived sympathetic neurons (11Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L.

Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). It was reported that Bim induction induced by NGF deprivation is partially mediated by the JNK pathway (12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 13Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37754-37760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the NGF-dependent signaling pathway that mediates the repression of Bim expression is unknown. With respect to posttranslational modification, Bim is phosphorylated in response to IL-3 in hematopoietic cells (14Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), but the consequences of this have not been described. Neurotrophic factors such as NGF play a major role in supporting the survival of neurons, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are only partially understood. Because Bim plays an important role in mediating the death of neurons and other cell types, we investigated how NGF regulates Bim so as to promote survival. We show that NGF actively down-regulates Bim expression via a MEK/ERK-dependent pathway, thereby repressing the proapoptotic influence of Bim. NGF also promotes rapid phosphorylation of Bim by a MEK/ERK-dependent pathway; such phosphorylation compromises the apoptotic activity of Bim and thereby represents an additional mechanism by which NGF provides protection from Bim-mediated death. Thus, NGF affects Bim activity on two distinct time scales,i.e. a fast phosphorylation followed by a slow down-regulation. Cell growth medium RPMI 1640, PlatinumTaq DNA polymerase, and LipofectAMINE 2000 were from Invitrogen.t-butoxycarbonyl-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (BAF) was from Enzyme Systems Products, Hoechst dye 33342 and anti-human NGF antiserum were from Sigma, and the Bim antibody was from StressGen. λ protein phosphatase was from New England Biolabs, and LY294002 and U0126 were from Calbiochem. Human recombinant NGF was a kind gift from Genentech, and CEP-1347 was a kind gift from Cephalon. PC12 cells were cultured as described previously in collagen-coated dishes with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum (15Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4872) Google Scholar). Neuronal differentiation was induced with NGF (100 ng/ml) in medium with 1% horse serum. For NGF deprivation, on day 7 of treatment the cultures were washed with NGF-free medium twice, and anti-NGF antibody (1:100) was added. Control cells were washed with serum-free medium and maintained in medium supplied with NGF without serum. Polyadenylated RNA from PC12 cells was reverse-transcribed and cDNA encoding BimEL was amplified by PCR using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primers for the amplification were 5′-GAATTCGAACCATGGCCAAGCAACCTTCTGA-3′ and 5′-GTCGACTCAATGCCTTCTCCATACCA-3′ (EcoRI andSalI linker sequences are underlined). The amplified products were digested with EcoRI and SalI, gel purified, and subcloned into pCMS-EGFP(Clontech). Point mutations were introduced into BimEL by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol and were verified by sequencing. Similarly, BimS and BimELΔ-(292–381) were generated by deletion of desired sequences of BimEL using site-directed mutagenesis and were verified by sequencing. DNA was prepared with a Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). PC12 cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid in 6-well dishes and 0.5 μg of plasmid in 24-well dishes overnight after plating using LipofectAMINE 2000. Six h later, medium with LipofectAMINE 2000 was supplemented with fresh complete medium with or without NGF or BAF as indicated. The number of intact, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-positive cells per well and the proportions of the apoptotic nuclei were assessed as described previously (16Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and results are reported as means ± S.E. PC12 cells were lysed, and protein was analyzed by Western immunoblotting as described previously (16Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell.

Detection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences) except in the blots shown in Figs. 1 B and 2 B, which employed SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce).Figure 2NGF phosphorylates and down-regulates Bim via the MEK/MAPK pathway. A, the NGF-induced shift in BimEL electrophoretic migration is due to phosphorylation and is blocked by an inhibitor of MEK but not of PI3K. PC12 cells were treated with NGF for 15 min, and cell extracts were then exposed to either buffer alone (Control) or λ protein phosphatase for 30 min at 30 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To test whether phosphorylation was through PI3K or MEK, cells were treated with NGF for 15 min in the presence of 50 μm LY294002 or 50 μm U0126, respectively. Western immunoblotting was as described in the Fig. 1 A legend. B, NGF-promoted phosphorylation of BimL is also mediated by the MEK/MAPK pathway.

NGF promotes PC12 cell neuronal differentiation (15Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4872) Google Scholar), whereas NGF withdrawal in the absence of serum results in their apoptotic death (16Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V.

The mechanisms by which NGF promotes survival appear to be similar in PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons (16Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 425-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and PC12 cells provide the advantage that they may be compared before and after NGF exposure. As shown in Fig.1, Western immunoblotting revealed the expression of Bim in both naı̈ve (NGF-untreated) and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells. The major form was BimEL, with lesser amounts of BimL and BimS. Brief exposure (10 min) of naı̈ve cells to NGF induced a mobility shift of BimEL so that a portion migrated more slowly (Fig. 1 A). A time course revealed that the shift was present within 5 min, maximal by 30–60 min, and then slowly declined but was still apparent by 24 h (Fig.1 B). A shift of BimL was also detectable by 30 min of treatment. In contrast, there was no apparent shift for BimS. When cells were subjected to long term (7 days) treatment with NGF to induce neuronal differentiation, there was a substantial drop in both the levels of the Bim protein and the proportion that migrated more slowly (Fig. 1, A and C). NGF deprivation for 8 h (a time before cell death is apparent) significantly induced the expression of BimEL as it does in sympathetic neurons (11Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). When the deprived cells were re-exposed to NGF for 10 min, the more slowly migrating form of BimEL was once again prominent (Fig.1 C). The NGF-dependent Bim mobility shift and the report that BimEL and BimL are phosphorylated in response to IL-3 in Baf-3 cells (14Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) prompted us to test whether the slowly migrating form of BimEL in NGF-treated cells is generated by phosphorylation. Accordingly, we exposed lysates of cells exposed to NGF for 30 min to either buffer alone or to λ protein phosphatase. Phosphatase treatment completely eradicated the NGF-promoted mobility shift (Fig.2 A). Taken together, our results thus show that NGF promotes both rapid phosphorylation of BimEL and BimL and long term down-regulation of Bim protein expression. The withdrawal of NGF from neuronally differentiated cells re-induces Bim expression, whereas NGF re-addition promotes rapid Bim re-phosphorylation. To explore the signaling pathways underlying NGF-promoted BimEL phosphorylation, we pretreated cells with LY294002 (50 μm), a specific PI3 kinase inhibitor (20Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar), and U0126 (50 μm), a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor (21Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 73: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2753) Google Scholar), and then exposed them to NGF for 15 min. Both compounds successfully distinguish between actions promoted by the PI3K and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways in PC12 cells and other cell types (22Wert M.M. Palfrey H.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Tsuruta F. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14040-14047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Western immunoblotting revealed that U0126 completely blocked BimEL phosphorylation but that, in contrast, LY294002 had no effect (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were achieved with BimL after a 30 min exposure to NGF (Fig.2 B). We next probed the signaling pathway by which NGF depresses Bim expression by treating neuronally differentiated cells with 50 μm LY294002 or U0126 in the presence of NGF. Inhibition of the PI3K had little or no effect on Bim expression, whereas, in contrast, the inhibition of MEK led to pronounced BimEL induction (Fig.2 C). Our results thus suggest that NGF-promoted repression of Bim expression as well as rapidly elevated Bim phosphorylation are mediated at least in part via the MEK/ERK pathway, and not by the PI3K pathway. If the MEK/ERK pathway mediates the repression of Bim expression, then what is the mechanism by which Bim is induced following NGF deprivation? Previous results with NGF-deprived cultured sympathetic neurons have indicated that the JNK signaling pathway plays a partial role in Bim induction (12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 13Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37754-37760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 D, this also appears to be the case for PC12 cells. When neuronally differentiated PC12 cells were deprived of NGF for 24 h and simultaneously exposed to CEP-1347, a specific inhibitor of apoptosis and of the JNK pathway in PC12 cells (16Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), there was a partial blockade of the induction of BimEL. To assess the effect of phosphorylation on the proapoptotic activity of Bim, we devised an over-expression system in which the coding region of rBimEL was inserted into the pCMS-EGFP vector and transiently transfected into PC12 cells. By comparison of endogenous and exogenous proteins on Western blots and with a transfection efficiency of about 50%, we estimate that BimEL was over-expressed by 20–40-fold in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor BAF (data not shown). At 24 h, the counts of surviving transfected cells (monitored by EGFP expression) revealed a large (95%) decrease for those transfected with BimEL as compared with those transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 3 A) or a vector containing a truncated cyclin B2 insert of similar size to BimEL (data not shown). In contrast, there was no difference for cells transfected with BimEL in the presence of BAF, thus ruling out a difference in initial transfection efficiency. The promotion of death by BimEL was also verified by staining nuclei with Hoechst 33342. Approximately 60% of nuclei in cells transfected with BimEL showed apoptotic morphology compared with ∼5% in control cultures (Fig.3 D). These findings are consistent with reports that Bim over-expression causes apoptosis of 293T human embryonic kidney cells (9O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) and sympathetic neurons (12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We next examined whether NGF rescues PC12 cells from death induced by BimEL. The addition of NGF within 6 h after transfection rescued 25–40% of the cells from death promoted by BimEL at 24 h (Fig.3 A). This represents a 5–10-fold increase in survival promoted by NGF. Consistent with this, NGF promoted a nearly 60% drop in the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in BimEL-transfected cultures (Fig. 3 D). Next we addressed whether rescue by NGF is due at least in part to stimulation of Bim phosphorylation. We reasoned that because BimS is the most potent death-inducing Bim isoform (9O'Connor L.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) and does not appear to undergo NGF-dependent phosphorylation, the critical phosphorylation sites for putative regulation of BimEL should be absent in BimS. If this is so, then NGF should be less effective in rescuing cells from death promoted by BimS than by BimEL. As shown in Fig.3 C, NGF rescued about half as many cells from death evoked by BimS as compared with BimEL. Conversely, the proportion of apoptotic nuclei was nearly twice as high in NGF-treated BimS-over-expressing cells than that in cells with over-expressed BimEL (Fig.3 D). Nevertheless, despite its higher apoptotic activity in presence of NGF, the transfected BimS protein was consistently present at lower levels than the BimEL protein (Fig. 3 E). These findings indicate that NGF-promoted phosphorylation regulates BimEL proapoptotic activity. To narrow the region of BimEL responsible for NGF regulation, we evaluated a construct, BimELΔ-(292–381), with a deletion corresponding to the sequence of BimL that is absent in BimS (see Fig.3 B). As for BimS, NGF was significantly less effective in suppressing death promoted by BimELΔ-(292–381) than by BimEL (Fig.3, C and D). This suggests that the site for NGF regulation lies within the BimEL sequence encoded by bases 292–381 (amino acids 98–127). To identify specific sites required for rescue by NGF, we generated BimEL constructs with point mutations at combinations of Ser and Thr residues within the region of amino acids 98–127 and tested them in our apoptosis assay. BimEL(S109G/T110A), BimEL(S109G), and BimEL(T110A) showed a resistance to rescue by NGF indistinguishable from that of BimS and BimELΔ-(292–381). In contrast, BimEL(S100G/T112A) and BimEL(S100G/S105G/T112A) behaved similarly to wild type BimEL (Fig. 3 D). Thus, NGF appears to attenuate the proapoptotic activity of BimEL by promoting phosphorylation of either Ser-109 or Thr-110. Despite the absence of Ser-109 and Thr-110, BimELΔ-(292–381) retained a mobility shift in response to NGF treatment (Fig.3 E). This shift indicates that NGF may mediate phosphorylation at additional sites of BimEL outside of amino acids 98–127. However, it is unclear whether such sites might contribute to NGF-mediated protection from death. Our aim was to study the mechanisms by which NGF protects neurons from death promoted by the BH3-only protein Bim. Recent studies established that NGF withdrawal from sympathetic neurons induces Bim, which then contributes to death (11Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Such induction could arise through the loss of NGF-dependent suppression of Bim expression and/or because the death mechanisms triggered by NGF deprivation lead to Bim induction. Sympathetic neurons cannot be easily maintained without NGF, and thus it is problematic to use them to distinguish between these possibilities. PC12 cells, in contrast, survive without NGF in the presence of serum, and with them we found that NGF reversibly down-regulates Bim. Thus, NGF actively represses Bim expression, and this contributes to the survival-promoting actions of NGF. Our findings indicate that a blockade of MEK, but not of PI3K, up-regulates Bim in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells in the presence of NGF. This indicates that NGF suppresses Bim expression at least in part through the well described Ras-dependent MEK/MAPK signaling cascade but not through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Consistent with this, each of these pathways independently regulates the survival of PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons (24Yan C.Y. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4042-4049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Xue L. Murray J.H. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8817-8824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Such a situation may be cell- and/or signal-specific in that Shinjyo et al. (14Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) reported that IL-3 down-regulates Bim in hematopoietic cells via both PI3K- and MAPK-dependent pathways. At least for the PI3K-dependent induction of Bim by IL-3, withdrawal required activation of the transcription factor FKHR-L1 (26Dijkers P.F. Birkenkamp K.U. Lam E.W. Thomas N.S. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Taken together, past and the present findings indicate that NGF represses Bim expression in neuronal cells by two mechanisms. As shown in past work, NGF suppresses apoptotic pathways that otherwise lead to induction of proapoptotic proteins such as Bim (11Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). For instance, NGF partly inhibits Bim induction by suppressing the proapoptotic activation of the JNK pathway (Refs. 12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar and 13Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37754-37760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and Fig.2 D), Additionally, as shown here, NGF actively suppresses Bim expression through the activation of MEK. These two mechanisms combine to assure that Bim expression remains at sub-apoptotic levels. As with sympathetic neurons, we found here that NGF withdrawal induces Bim expression in PC12 cells. Based on the above considerations, this is likely to result from several distinct mechanisms. One is via activation of the JNK/cJun apoptotic pathway. Interference with this pathway partly blocks Bim induction in sympathetic neurons (12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 13Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37754-37760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we have found that this is also the case for NGF-deprived PC12 cells (Fig. 2 D). A second event is cessation of MEK signaling and the consequent reversal of Bim suppression. Neither mechanism alone appears to fully account for Bim induction after NGF withdrawal; interference with the JNK/cJun pathway only partially blocks Bim induction (Refs. 12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar and 13Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37754-37760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and Fig. 2 D), and the blockade of MEK activity with U0126 is less effective in inducing Bim than is the removal of NGF (Fig. 2 C). Thus NGF withdrawal triggers multiple mechanisms that appear to contribute to the elevation of Bim to levels that promote apoptosis. In addition to relatively slow effects on Bim expression, NGF rapidly promoted phosphorylation of BimEL and BimL but not of BimS. Our results indicated that this phosphorylation suppresses the proapoptotic activity of Bim. NGF reduced death promoted by exogenous BimEL and was significantly less effective in blocking death promoted by exogenous BimS. This was also the case for a mutant form of BimEL with the deletion of a domain present in BimEL and BimL but not in BimS. NGF also less effectively suppressed death evoked by BimEL constructs with point mutations at either of two potential sites of phosphorylation within the domain not present in BimS. Although our data support a model in which NGF-promoted phosphorylation compromises the proapoptotic activity of Bim, there are several issues that must be addressed. For instance, if this model is correct, why does NGF only rescue a proportion of cells after Bim transfection? A likely possibility is that we utilized an over-expression system such that, if even a fraction of Bim was in a non-phosphorylated state, it was sufficient to induce death. In support of this, immunoblotting indicated that a detectable fraction of endogenous and exogenous Bim remained non-phosphorylated in the presence of NGF. An alternative is that phosphorylated Bim, although less efficient in promoting death, retains at least some proapoptotic activity. A second question pertains to the effects of NGF on death induced by BimS and several Bim mutant forms. In these cases, although NGF was significantly less effective in blocking death than in the case of wild-type BimEL, why does it nevertheless provide some degree of protection? An attractive explanation is that NGF rescues cells by multiple means, including actions downstream of mitochondria (27Deshmukh M. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and that such mechanisms provide partial protection even from over-expressed forms of Bim that are not subject to regulation by phosphorylation. Our findings indicate that NGF-promoted Bim phosphorylation is mediated by the MEK/ERK pathway. This contrasts with the BH3-only protein Bad that is targeted for phosphorylation and the consequent suppression of proapoptotic activity by the PI3K/AKT pathway (4Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4956) Google Scholar). In the latter case, phosphorylation promotes interaction with the 14-3-3 protein and sequestration away from mitochondria. We do not presently know how NGF-promoted Bim phosphorylation modifies its proapoptotic activity. It is intriguing that the putative phosphorylation sites at Ser-109 and Thr-110, which are important for rescue by NGF, lie within the DKST region that has been identified for binding of Bim to the dynein light chain LC8 (28Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Bim is sequestered to the microtubule-associated dynein motor complex of healthy cells and released by apoptotic stimuli (28Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be that phosphorylation promotes such sequestration of Bim. On the other hand, the Bim-LC8 interaction was discovered in a yeast two-hybrid system and occurs in mammalian co-expression systems, and in neither case was there evidence that phosphorylation occurred or was required (28Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). In addition, we have been unable to find evidence in PC12 cells that NGF-promoted phosphorylation of Bim alters its association with the microtubule cytoskeleton (data not shown). Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-109/Thr-110 may regulate interaction of Bim with yet an additional partner. Our and other findings indicate that NGF regulates Bim at several levels. NGF depresses Bim expression and suppresses apoptotic pathways that contribute to its induction. NGF also acutely promotes Bim phosphorylation, which in turn inhibits its proapoptotic activity. This multi-level mechanism may have evolved not only to provide multiple means to protect healthy cells from a potentially lethal molecule like Bim, but also to do so over different temporal scales. Repression and induction of Bim by NGF addition and withdrawal, respectively, occur over a time course of hours to tens of hours. This assures that death occurs only after a prolonged time of NGF withdrawal and not during a temporary loss of trophic support. Moreover, the acute survival-promoting phosphorylation of Bim provides neurons with a rapid protection mechanism upon the reversal of prolonged trophic factor deprivation. In this regard, it is significant that acute Bim phosphorylation occurred not only for “naı̈ve” PC12 cells, but also for neuronally differentiated cells in which long term NGF withdrawal was followed by NGF restoration. Although Bim phosphorylation was maintained during continuous exposure to NGF, the proportion of the total Bim protein that was phosphorylated was diminished at 24 h and substantially lowered by 1 week of NGF treatment. This presumably reflects the slow fall in ERK signaling that occurs during continuous NGF exposure (29Qiu M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, this loss of phosphorylation is offset by the repression of Bim expression that occurs over this time. Finally, the regulation of Bim expression and phosphorylation by IL-3 in addition to NGF suggests that the present findings are relevant to additional trophic agents and cell types."

https://openalex.org/W1964234385,"Aplidin, a new antitumoural drug presently in phase II clinical trials, has shown both in vitro and in vivo activity against human cancer cells. Aplidin effectively inhibits cell viability by triggering a canonical apoptotic program resulting in alterations in cell morphology, caspase activation, and chromatin fragmentation. Pro-apoptotic concentrations of Aplidin induce early oxidative stress, which results in a rapid and persistent activation of both JNK and p38 MAPK and a biphasic activation of ERK. Inhibition of JNK and p38 MAPK blocks the apoptotic program induced by Aplidin demonstrating its central role in the integration of the cellular stress induced by the drug. JNK and p38 MAPK activation results in downstream cytochrome c release and activation of caspases -9 and -3 and PARP cleavage, demonstrating the mediation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in this process. We also demonstrate that protein kinase C delta (PKC-delta) mediates the cytotoxic effect of Aplidin and that it is concomitantly processed and activated late in the apoptotic process by a caspase mediated mechanism. Remarkably, cells deficient in PKC-delta show enhanced survival upon drug treatment as compared to its wild type counterpart. PKC-delta thus appears as an important component necessary for full caspase cascade activation and execution of apoptosis, which most probably initiates a positive feedback loop further amplifying the apoptotic process."
https://openalex.org/W2050484748,"Muc4/sialomucin complex (SMC) is a multifunctional glycoprotein complex which can repress apoptosis in transfected tumor cells. Its transmembrane subunit acts as an intramembrane ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 to induce the phosphorylation of ErbB2 and, by acting synergistically with the ErbB3 ligand neuregulin, can potentiate the phosphorylation of ErbB2 and ErbB3. In the present study we show that Muc4/SMC alone robustly induces the phosphorylation of ErbB2 to enhance the tyrosine phosphate epitope (Tyr1248) recognized by anti-phospho-ErbB2. Although this tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in cell transformation, it does not activate any of the three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) or protein kinase B/Akt of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase pathway. Instead, Muc4/SMC expression induces up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip, consistent with the expression of Muc4/SMC in differentiated, rather than proliferative, epithelial cells. Interestingly, a combination of Muc4/SMC and neuregulin down-regulate p27kip and activate protein kinase B/Akt. These observations suggest that Muc4/SMC acts as a regulator of differentiation by inducing a limited phosphorylation of ErbB2 and a modulator of proliferation when acting synergistically with neuregulin to induce a more extensive phosphorylation on both ErbB2 and ErbB3."

Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) 1The abbreviations used are: VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; EVH1 and -2, Ena/VASP homology 1 and 2, respectively; PRD, proline-rich domain; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; GST, glutathioneS-transferase was originally identified as a protein phosphorylated in response to an elevation of intracellular cAMP or cGMP levels by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase in human platelets (1Waldmann R. Nieberding M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). VASP is a member of the Ena/VASP family of proteins that share a domain structure composed of three conserved domains: an N-terminal Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domain; a central proline-rich, Src homology 3-binding domain (PRD); and a C-terminal EVH2 domain. The EVH1 domain, which is also present in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and N-WASP, binds to proteins containing the consensus sequence FPPPP, such as Listeria monocytogenes surface protein ActA, and interacts with the PRD of WASP (2Niebuhr K.

The EVH2 domain, which is unique to the Ena/VASP family, mediates VASP's tetramerization, F-actin binding, and actin bundling (9Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Involvement of VASP in the regulation of actin assembly and cell motility was suggested by the results of studies on actin-based movement of Listeria. Listeria movement was abolished in VASP-depleted platelet extracts and could be restored by the addition of recombinant VASP (10Laurent V. Loisel T. Harbeck B. Wehman A. Grobe L. Jockusch B. Wehland J. Gertler F. Carlier M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). VASP and EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein) induce polymerization of G-actin into F-actin bundles in in vitroassays in the presence of low salt and stabilize F-actin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (10Laurent V. Loisel T. Harbeck B. Wehman A. Grobe L. Jockusch B. Wehland J. Gertler F. Carlier M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As expected from the ability of VASP to induce actin polymerization, in vitroreconstitution of Listeria movement using purified proteins demonstrated that the speed of bacterial movement is greatly enhanced if VASP is added to the reconstitution mixture (11Loisel T. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M. Nature. 1999; 40: 613-616Crossref Scopus (810) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that VASP enhances actin polymerization at a site on theListeria surface to generate propelling power. The mechanism of membrane protrusion through localized actin polymerization during eukaryotic cell motility was suggested to be similar to that used in the intracellular movement of bacterial pathogens (12Machesky L. Cooper J. Nature. 1999; 401: 542-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Machesky L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E29-E31Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The biological role of VASP in controlling cell movement and actin assembly is complex. The analysis of VASP function in axonal guidance and cell motility has produced contradictory results on the role of VASP in eukaryotic cell movement. In B16 melanoma cells, the observation that the concentration of VASP at the leading edge is directly proportional to the lamellipodial protrusion rate supports involvement of VASP in cell motility (14Rottner K. Behrendt B. Small J. Wehland J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that VASP deficiency in murine fibroblast results in decreased cell motility in a wound healing assay due to defects in retracting the posterior of the cell and reorienting the leading edge (15Garcia Arguinzonis M.I. Galler A.B. Walter U. Reinhard M. Simm A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Murine Ena (Mena) is enriched in the filopodial tips of the neuronal growth cone and is required for proper axonal path-finding (16Lanier L. Gates M. Witke W. Menzies A. Wehman A. Macklis J. Kwiatkowski D. Soriano P. Gertler F. Neuron. 1999; 22: 313-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, other studies support the negative role of VASP in cell motility. Overexpression of VASP in fibroblasts leads to a decrease in cell motility, whereas “depletion” of VASP from the cytosol and cortex by artificially localizing endogenous VASP to mitochondria causes an increase in cell speed (17Bear J. Loureiro J. Libova I. Fassler R. Wehland J. Gertler F. Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ena (Drosophila VASP), which binds to the cytoplasmic domain of Robo, helps mediate repulsion during axonal guidance (18Bashaw G. Kidd T. Murray D. Pawson T. Goodman C. Cell. 2000; 101: 703-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). cAMP and cGMP inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation, which requires dynamic actin reorganization followed by cell shape change. Invasp null platelets, cAMP- and cGMP-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation is significantly reduced (19Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Ahmad M. Glauner M. Zhou X. Ny L. Andersson K. Kehrel B. Offermanns S. Fassler R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and vaspnull platelets change shape very rapidly before aggregation, suggesting that VASP inhibits actin reorganization, leading to the inhibition of cell shape change and aggregation. New insight into the mechanism of VASP function in mammalian cells has been obtained through the finding that VASP controls actin filament length and its geometry under physiological (salt level) conditions by competing with F-actin capping proteins (20Bear J.E. Svitkina T.M. Krause M. Schafer D.A. Loureiro J.J. Strasser G.A. Maly I.V. Chaga O.Y. Cooper J.A. Borisy G.G. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2002; 108: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Highly branched, shorter actin filaments arising from VASP deficiency are thought to be more efficient for persistent protrusion than long, unbranched filaments resulting from an excess of VASP. To gain more insight into the role of VASP in chemotaxis, we studied the function of a Dictyostelium VASP family member, DdVASP, in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in unstimulatedDictyostelium cells and during chemotaxis by characterizing the phenotypes of Ddvasp null and overexpressing cells. This study further elucidates the roles of VASP in regulating the actin reorganization. We found that VASP is essential for filopodia formation, cell-substratum adhesion, and proper chemotaxis. The full sequence of the DdVASP open reading frame was amplified by PCR using a pair of primers designed from the DdVASP homologue in the Dictyostelium genome data base and subcloned in pBluescript KS(−). The central part of the gene from codon 111 to 228 was replaced by the blasticidin resistance cassette to make a knockout construct. For the overexpression vector, the sequences of DdVASP and constructs for various domain structures were subcloned downstream of the Actin 15 (Act15) promoter in EXP4(+). The GFP sequence was ligated in-frame to the N terminus of each DdVASP fragment to construct the GFP fusion expression vector. To target DdVASP to the membrane, the sequence for the N-terminal 16 amino acids of chicken c-Src composed of a myristoylation signal and a basic amino acid cluster sufficient for stable membrane association (21Sigal C. Zhou W. Buser C. McLaughlin S. Resh M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12253-12257Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) was added in frame to the N terminus of the DdVASP sequence. Wild-type Ax3 cells were grown in HL5 medium and transformed as described previously (22Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Screening for a proper knockout was performed by PCR followed by confirmation by genomic Southern blot analysis. To obtain clones overexpressing DdVASP, we selected transformants at 10 μg/ml G418 and checked the expression level of each clone by Western blot analysis. A peptide, KGEAIRASQH, derived from the C terminus of DdVASP, was synthesized by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX) for use as an antigen. Anti-DdVASP rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against this peptide by Strategic Biosolutions (Ramona, CA). The prepared antibody was further purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, NY1988Google Scholar). For indirect immunofluorescence staining, the antibody was further cleared by preabsorption of excess Ddvasp null cells permeabilized by treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 min. The immunofluorescence was done as described previously (24Chung C. Firtel R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 559-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Analysis of subcellular localization and chemotaxis of aggregation-competent cells was performed as described by Funamoto et al. (22Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and two-dimensional analysis was done using DIAS image analysis software (25Wessels D. Soll D. Soll D. Wessels D. Motion Analysis of Living Cells. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 101-140Google Scholar). Cells were chosen at random with the requirement that they move for at least 10 min without touching another cell. For micropipette assays, there was no measurable difference in the average speed of the cells at the beginning or end of this period (farther away from or closer to the micropipette). Cells were examined from at least two independent experiments performed on separate days. For three-dimensional DIAS analysis, control and Ddvasp null cells were grown in suspension in HL5 to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. To initiate development, cells were washed free of nutrient medium in basic salts solution (BSS; 20 mmKCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mmKH2PO4 (pH 6.4)) and then dispersed onto filter pads as a smooth carpet at a density of 5 × 106cells/cm2 (26Soll D. Spudich J. Methods in Cell Biology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1987: 413-431Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at the ripple stage of development, which represents the onset of aggregation. For the three-dimensional analysis of cells responding to a spatial gradient of cAMP, we employed a chamber developed for the analysis of T-cell chemotaxis (27Shutt D. Jenkins L. Carolan E. Stapleton J. Daniels K. Kennedy R. Soll D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 99-109PubMed Google Scholar) and suitable for differential interference contrast microscopy. Cells at the ripple stage of development were allowed to adhere to a glass coverslip that was clamped over a quartz bridge (28Tuxworth R. Weber I. Wessels D. Addicks G. Soll D. Gerisch G. Titus M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 318-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Video imaging and three-dimensional DIAS software analyses were done as described previously using a pixel complexity algorithm (25Wessels D. Soll D. Soll D. Wessels D.

Reconstruction of a three-dimensional faceted image of the cell surface and computation of three-dimensional parameters have been described elsewhere in detail (29Soll D. Voss E. Johnson O. Wessels D. Scanning. 2000; 22: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Directional change was computed as the direction in the interval (n− 1, n) minus the direction in the interval (n,n + 1). Height was computed as the maximum height of the faceted reconstruction. Overhang was computed as the percentage of the cell volume that does not lie directly over the portion of the cell that is attached to the substrate. The chemotactic index was determined from the three-dimensional centroid track as the net distance moved toward the source of chemoattractant divided by the total distance moved in a time period. Quantification of F-actin levels was accomplished by measuring TRITC-phalloidin bound to F-actin as described previously (31Chung C. Lee S. Briscoe C. Ellsworth C. Firtel R. Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5225-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For the measurement of in vitro actin polymerization activity of DdVASP deletion mutants, GST fusion proteins were added to theDdvasp null cell extract. Pulsed cells (1.5 × 108 cells) were broken in 1 ml of PMKE (12 mmsodium/potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA) by passage through a membrane (pore size 5 μm) and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. GST fusion proteins (100 nm or 1 μm) were added immediately to the supernatant (4.3 mg/ml protein) to initiate a reaction and incubated at 22 °C. At the times indicated, 40 μl of reaction mixture was transferred to 1 ml of actin staining solution to stop the reaction. The subsequent procedure was the same as described previously (31Chung C. Lee S. Briscoe C. Ellsworth C. Firtel R. Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5225-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Wet weight per cell was determined as follows. Vegetative cells (∼108 cells) grown axenically were suspended in 1 ml of HL5 containing 4 mg/ml blue dextran and pelleted by spinning at 1,500 × g for 2 min. The pellet was weighed and resuspended in 0.5 ml of Na/K buffer. The void volume of the pellet was calculated from the absorbance at 620 nm of the supernatant compared with the standard curve. The net weight of the pellet (total pellet weight minus the void volume of the pellet) was divided by the cell number. Phagocytosis of fluorescent 1-μm latex beads (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) was assayed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with a modification of the original assay described by Vogelet al. (32Vogel G. Thilo L. Schwarz H. Steinhart R. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), as detailed by Tuxworth et al. (28Tuxworth R. Weber I. Wessels D. Addicks G. Soll D. Gerisch G. Titus M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 318-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The amount of latex internalized was corrected for cell size by normalizing all points to either forward scattering (which is a measure of cell size) or protein amounts using the BCA assay (Pierce). The adhesion of fluorescent 4.5-μm latex beads (Polysciences) at 0 °C was quantified as described by Tuxworth et al. (28Tuxworth R. Weber I. Wessels D. Addicks G. Soll D. Gerisch G. Titus M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 318-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The bead binding was also normalized for cell size. A rough estimate of the cell area was obtained by measuring the two longest axes of all cells in the field and multiplying these. The phagocytosis and bead binding assays were performed in parallel with the MVII null mutant HTD17-1 and a control, nonhomologous transformant (28Tuxworth R. Weber I. Wessels D. Addicks G. Soll D. Gerisch G. Titus M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 318-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The cloning of a gene encoding aDictyostelium member of the Ena/VASP family of cytoskeleton regulators (DdVASP) is described under “Experimental Procedures.” This is the only member of the Ena/VASP family found in theDictyostelium data base. A comparison of the derived amino acid sequence of Dictyostelium DdVASP with VASP family members from several metazoans shows a moderately conserved primary sequence and a conserved domain structure (Fig.1, A and B). DdVASP transcripts are expressed in vegetatively growing cells and increase upon starvation, peaking at 8 h (aggregation stage), and then remain high until fruiting body formation (Fig. 1 C). The gene encoding DdVASP was disrupted by homologous recombination, which was confirmed by Southern and RNA blot analyses (data not shown). Four clones were isolated. Initial experiments on these clones indicated that all exhibited similar phenotypes (data not shown). One clone was chosen for a detailed study. Ddvasp null cells exhibited a rate of cell division indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells. In addition, multicellular development was normal except for the formation of smaller fruiting bodies (data not shown). This is presumably due to the smaller size of the Ddvaspnull cells, which have a cell volume that is ∼60% that of wild-type cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). To examine the role of DdVASP, we created four strains that express different levels of DdVASP protein as determined by Western blot using an anti-Dictyostelium DdVASP antibody (Fig. 2 A; see “Experimental Procedures”). Ddvasp null (Ddvasp −) cells, as expected, have no detectable DdVASP protein (Fig. 2 A). Strains exhibiting a level of DdVASP expression higher (DdVASPH) or lower (DdVASPL) than that of wild-type cells were obtained by transformation of wild-type strain KAx-3 or Ddvasp null cells, respectively, with a DdVASP expression vector followed by selection of clones expressing the desired level of DdVASP. We used TRITC-phalloidin to visualize F-actin distribution in vegetative cells of the four DdVASP strains. Ddvasp null cells exhibit an F-actin staining pattern different from that of the other cell lines (Fig. 2 B). In Ddvasp null cells, F-actin is concentrated in a few small regions around the cells' periphery. In contrast to the other DdVASP strains, the cell surfaces of Ddvasp null cells look smooth with no visible actin-containing, filopodia-like membrane protrusions (filopodia; Fig. 2 B; TableI) (28Tuxworth R. Weber I. Wessels D. Addicks G. Soll D. Gerisch G. Titus M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 318-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), a phenotype that is strikingly similar to that of mouse embryonic stem cells lacking Cdc42, a Rho family member linked to filopodia formation (33Chen F.

The difference in the steady-state number of filopodia and F-actin content of cell lines expressing DdVASP at various levels is summarized in Table I. Despite the observed lack of filopodia, Ddvasp null vegetative cells have the same F-actin level as wild-type cells. On the other hand, DdVASPH cells are enriched in the steady-state level of filopodia on the surface and have a higher F-actin content. The lack of filopodia in Ddvasp null cells is rescued by expression of DdVASP, even at levels lower than expressed in wild-type cells (Fig. 2 B and Table I, strain DdVASPL).Table ICorrelation of steady-state filopodia number and F-actin content in VASP mutantsFilopodia number per cell1-aThe steady-state number of filopodia in the plane of focus were counted after actin staining. 40–60 cells were counted from each cell line.Relative F-actin level1-bF-actin contents per cell protein of vegetative cell were compared to KAx-3.Approximate relative expression level1-cExpression levels were compared by Western blot analysis using anti-DdVASP (EVH2) antibody except for EVH1-PRD/vasp−.%%KAx-3 (wild type I)7.1 ± 4.1100100Ddvasp −0.9 ± 1.498 ± 40DdVASPH15 ± 4.8145 ± 8400DdVASPL4.6 ± 3.599 ± 550myr-VASP/vasp −47 ± 18168 ± 12120EVH1-PRD/vasp −1.1 ± 1.2102 ± 63001-dThis was measured indirectly because this construct does not have the EVH2 epitope.

Open table in a new tab Since DdVASP is required for filopodia formation inDictyostelium, we wanted to investigate whether membrane targeting of DdVASP would result in an elevated, steady-state level of filopodia. To pursue this question, we made use of the fact that the addition of a myristoylation tag on proteins directs them to the plasma membrane. As depicted in Fig. 2 C, myr-DdVASP is highly enriched at the cell cortex, even in vegetative cells. As shown in Fig.2 C and Table I, there are large increases in F-actin content and the steady-state number of filopodia in vegetative and pulsed cells as compared with those observed in DdVASPH cells. The average level of expression of myr-DdVASP is approximately the same as that of endogenous DdVASP and significantly less than observed in DdVASPH cells (Fig. 2 A). Cells expressing higher levels of myr-DdVASP (as determined by immunostaining with the anti-DdVASP antibody) do not become polarized and have enriched F-actin in filopodia localized around the cell (Fig. 2 C,cell a). Even cells expressing much lower levels of myr-DdVASP (as determined by weak immunostaining), which become polarized and are F-actin-enriched in their poles, have filopodia-like spikes protruding from one of the poles (Fig. 2 C,cells b and c). Since these structures are not observed in wild-type cells, we conclude they result from myr-DdVASP expression. The results are consistent with membrane-targeted DdVASP being able to directly regulate the steady-state level of filopodia and possibly control filopodia formation as well as being required for their natural formation in wild-type cells. To examine which of the DdVASP subdomains is responsible for filopodia formation, we expressed various DdVASP deletion mutants, EVH1-PRD, EVH1-EVH2, and PRD-EVH2, inDdvasp null cells. All proteins are expressed stably and at levels comparable with that of DdVASP in DdVASPH cells. Previous studies indicated that recombinant human VASP is able to stimulate F-actin polymerization under low salt conditions and F-actin bundling in a cell-free system, whereas EVH2 has a weak F-actin polymerization activity but no bundling activity (10Laurent V. Loisel T. Harbeck B. Wehman A. Grobe L. Jockusch B. Wehland J. Gertler F. Carlier M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We determinedin vitro actin polymerization activity of subdomains as GST fusion proteins under low salt conditions and basal F-actin level of the Ddvasp null cell lines expressing DdVASP subdomains and compared these with the in vivo phenotypes of these strains.Ddvasp null cells expressing PRD-EVH2 resulted in even larger numbers of filopodia and a higher F-actin level than observed in DdVASPH, whereas overexpression of EVH1-PRD or EVH1-EVH2 did not result in a significant change in filopodia number (Fig.2 D; Table I). PRD-EVH2 exhibited an efficacy in the in vitro actin polymerization assay similar to that of full-length DdVASP (Fig. 3 A). Expression of EVH1-EVH2 in a Ddvasp null cell results in a 30% increase in the F-actin level; there is no increase of filopodia formation. EVH1-PRD expression does not result in a change in the F-actin level or the number of steady-state filopodia. This finding is consistent with an absence of in vitro actin polymerization stimulating activity of this subdomain (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the ability of DdVASP and DdVASP subdomains to promote filopodia corresponds to the ability of these domains to stimulate F-actin polymerization in vitro (Fig. 3). To examine the dynamic localization of DdVASP in cells, we expressed GFP-tagged DdVASP, which can complement the Ddvasp null cell phenotypes, in wild-type cells. In cells moving up a chemoattractant gradient, the majority of GFP-DdVASP is found dispersed in the cytoplasm; however, a bright fluorescent band is seen at the site of lamellipod/pseudopod protrusion (Fig. 4 A). DdVASP-GFP also localizes weakly to pseudopodia in randomly migrating cells (data not shown). We examined DdVASP localization and F-actin distribution in polarized cells by carrying out double staining of fixed cells using our anti-DdVASP antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”) and TRITC-phalloidin. DdVASP immunostaining in the cell's anterior overlaps the F-actin staining (Fig. 4 C). Under these experimental conditions, DdVASP immunostaining was diffuse at the leading edge. Interestingly, in some cells (see the cell in Fig.4 C), we observed a thin, more intense fluorescent band corresponding to the posterior of the F-actin-enriched domain, suggesting that the concentration of DdVASP may be highest in this region. It is possible this band may correspond to the site of highest actin polymerization. In vegetative cells, DdVASP is predominantly cytosolic, although strong staining is observed in filopodia (Fig.4 D), which overlaps with F-actin staining. During filopodia formation, GFP-DdVASP is transiently localized in the tip of filopodia (Fig. 4 B). GFP-DdVASP is also localized in the cell-cell contact sites of cell aggregates (Fig. 4 B).

S., Wang, B., Aguilar-Santelises, M., Raja, S. M., Uhlin-Hansen, L., Podack, E., Trapani, J. A., and Froelich, C. J. (2002)Immunity 16, 417–428). We now report our biophysical studies establishing the nature of granzyme B-serglycin (GrB·SG) complex. Dynamic laser light scattering studies establish that SG has a hydrodynamic radius of ∼140 ± 23 nm, comparable to some viral particles. Agarose mobility shift gels and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), show that SG binds tightly to GrB and has the capacity to hold 30–60 GrB molecules. SPR studies also indicate equivalent binding affinities (K d ∼ 0.8 μm), under acidic (granule pH) and neutral isotonic conditions (extra-cytoplasmic pH), for GrB·SG interaction. Finally, characterization of GrB·SG interactions within granules revealed complexes of two distinct molecular sizes, one held ∼4–8 molecules of GrB, whereas the other contained as many as 32 molecules of GrB or other granule proteins. These studies provide a firm biophysical basis for our earlier reported observations that the proapoptotic granzyme is exocytosed predominantly as a macromolecular complex with SG. We have recently shown that the physiological mediator of granule-mediated apoptosis is a macromolecular complex of granzymes and perforin complexed with the chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan, serglycin (Metkar, S.

However, the molecular details regarding the mechanism of its action are far from clear. A third component of the system, which has received very little attention, is the lymphocyte granule proteoglycan, serglycin (SG). Granzymes and perforin are presumed to exist within the cytoplasmic granules as an ionically linked macromolecular complex with this proteoglycan. The primary amino acid sequence reveals that granzymes as well as perforin are highly cationic and, therefore, would predictably have a strong interaction with the highly anionic sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of the granule proteoglycan. We have recently shown that granzyme B (GrB) is exocytosed as a macromolecular complex with serglycin and not in a free form (1Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M. Raja S.M. Uhlin-Hansen L.

Using in vitro reconstituted GrB·SG complex as a model system, we demonstrated that the macromolecular complex can be endocytosed into target cells and induce apoptosis, when delivered by perforin. In addition to GrB·SG, the involvement of proteoglycan-protease complexes in biological processes has been documented for other proteases, including mast cell tryptase and chymase (2Goldstein S.M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We had initially shown that target cells bind and internalize membrane-bound granzyme and speculated that delivery of the granzyme to the cytosol was dependent on uptake of membrane remnants carrying PFN pores (9Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottlieb R. Babior B. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29073-29079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The granule-mediated cell death pathway appears, however, to share a greater similarity to viral-mediated cellular penetration than initially anticipated. A macromolecular granule complex consisting of granzymes, serglycin (SG), and PFN, analogous to a viral particle, may be the central effector. The granule-associated proteoglycan SG contributes to granule-mediated apoptosis by acting as a carrier, which facilitates internalization of GrB and/or PFN. Accordingly, the killer cell is predicted to secrete the macromolecular complex into the synapse-like space between effector and target cell. The complex then binds to the target cell and undergoes endocytosis. Within the acidic vesicle, PFN alters the endocytic membrane facilitating release of the granzyme complex to the cytosol. Although the current understanding of granzyme B/perforin mediated apoptosis pathway in target cells has come from in vitro studies using free granzyme and perforin, our recent data make a compelling case that the macromolecular complex of granzyme B with serglycin, and not free cationic granzyme B, is the physiological form involved in the induction of apoptosis in target cells. The implication of this finding is enormous, necessitating re-evaluation of reported molecular events underlying this crucial host defense process, including the mechanism of internalization of GrB in its physiological form as a complex with SG, the mechanism of release of the complex from endocytic vesicles, as well as the subsequent physiological intracellular targets accessed in the complexed form of this protease. A clear understanding of the mechanism of granzyme B-mediated apoptosis, can only be achieved by understanding the molecular nature of the macromolecular complex. Following up on our most recent work, which shows that the macromolecular GrB·SG complex is the physiological form of GrB involved in granule apoptosis (1Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M.

Acta. 1992; 212: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), with a slightly modified protocol as described below. GrB esterolytic activity was measured using Boc-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-p-nitroanilide (IETD-pNA) as described in (1Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M. Raja S.M. Uhlin-Hansen L. Podack E. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Essentially, the rate of hydrolysis of IETD-pNA (200 μm) by GrB samples at concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 nm in a total volume of 200 μl, was measured spectrophotometrically using a SpectraPlus Vmax (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) plate reader, in 96-well plates. We used a quantitative dye-binding assay for analysis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans, using a slightly modified protocol described by Thuy and Nyhan (14Thuy L.P. Nyhan W.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1992; 212: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Essentially, a standard curve was generated using varying concentrations of standard chondroitin sulfate, ranging from 0 to 2.5 μg/ml. CS standards as well as the SG sample, whose concentration was to be determined, were incubated with a solution of Azure A in water, having an A 635 ∼ 1.0. Binding of Azure A to CS results in a decrease in A 635, which is proportional to the GAG concentration. The plot ofA 635 versus GAG concentration shows a linear dependence with a negative slope, corresponding to the absorbance change per microgram/ml GAG. The concentration of the sample can then be calculated from the decrease inA 635. The concentration of CS or SG, described in the text, is in terms of its GAG content. Purified proteoglycans were resuspended in either chondroitinase buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0) or heparinase/heparitinase buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0). Samples were digested with 0.5 unit/ml chondroitinase ABC at 37 °C overnight or with 0.02 unit/ml of heparinase or heparitinase. These digestions were carried out at 37 °C and 43 °C overnight, respectively. The samples were analyzed either on a 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE, 1% native agarose gels, or on capillary electrophoresis. The SG dissolved in distilled water was treated with 0.5 m NaOH overnight at 4 °C. The GAG chains and oligosaccharides were liberated from the core peptide by mild alkaline treatment with sodium borohydride (15Park Y. Yu G. Gunay N.S. Linhardt R.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The samples were dialyzed against water before capillary electrophoresis analysis. Cells (YT, 1 × 106/ml) grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C were incubated with for 20–24 h. Cytotoxic granules were isolated from the YT cells essentially as described earlier (11Hanna W.L. Zhang X. Turbov J. Winkler U. Hudig D. Froelich C.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The granule fractions were then solubilized with Zwittergent 3–12 (0.5%, overnight). The insoluble membrane fraction was separated from the soluble fraction by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The GrB activity of supernatant was measured by IETD-pNA activity. The sample was subjected to size-exclusion membrane filtration using Microcon YM-100 (100-kDa exclusion) (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as earlier reported (1Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M. Raja S.M. Uhlin-Hansen L. Podack E. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The retentate sample was then analyzed on a 1% agarose gel under native conditions, along with in vitro generated GrB·SG complexes, containing varying ratio of GrB·SG (as described below). This step was followed by transfer onto a PVDF membrane, and the GrB·SG complexes were detected by Western analysis using anti-GrB mAb. Free GrB and SGbiotin were also run for comparison. SGbiotin was detected by probing with streptavidin-HRP. GrB·SG complexes were prepared by mixing isolated GrB and SG in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl. Mixtures were placed on ice for 20 min followed by centrifugal ultrafiltration through a membrane with a 100-kDa exclusion limit (Microcon YM-100, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The choice of membrane was dependent on the observation that GrB exits only in monomeric form (32 kDa) and thus would be retained by the membrane if complexed to the proteoglycan. The mixtures were spun until the controls lacked retentates. The concentrations of GrB, in the retentate (i.e. complexes) and in the filtrate, were measured using hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate, IETD-pNA. Capillary electrophoresis was performed using an automated Beckman MDQ Pace electrophoresis system. Uncoated fused silica capillaries with 50-μm internal diameter and 50-cm length were from Beckman. Electrophoresis buffer consisted of 20 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.8, containing either 50 mm boric acid (16al-Hakim A. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or 50 mm SDS (17Desai U.R. Wang H. Ampofo S.A. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A new capillary was rinsed sequentially with ∼5 capillary volumes each of 0.5 m NaOH, distilled, deionized water and finally with electrophoresis buffer before use. This rinse sequence was also used for periodic regeneration of the capillary. The sample was injected using pneumatic pressure to give a capillary plug volume of ∼2–5%. Sample concentrations ranged from 1 to 5 mg/ml. Electrophoresis was performed using a constant voltage of 5, 7, or 10 kV, in the normal polarity mode. A UV-visible detector consisting of a filter at either 214 or 280 nm was used to collect the changes in absorbance of electrophoresis buffer passing through a 2-mm window. A data collection frequency of 4 Hz was found sufficient to obtain good electropherograms. The inter-day variation in migration time was ∼10%. Sedimentation velocity studies, on purified SG preparations, were performed using two-channel Epon centerpieces on a Beckman Coulter XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. SG samples were run in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl. SG at three different concentrations ofA 260 of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7, corresponding to ∼15, 20, and 25 μg/ml, in terms of GAG content, were used. Experiments were performed at 20 °C and 35,000 rpm. The rotor with protein sample was equilibrated in the centrifuge to 20 °C in vacuum before each run was started. Velocity data were collected in continuous scan mode with a step size of 0.003 cm at 260 nm. Data editing, van Holde-Weischet analysis (18van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and finite element analysis (19Demeler B. Saber H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were performed using UltraScan version 5.0. 2Demeler, B. (2001) An integrated data analysis software package for sedimentation experiments, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Department of Biochemistry, available at www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu. Sedimentation coefficients, diffusion coefficients, and molecular weights were corrected for water at 20 °C as reported by UltraScan. Particle size distribution and hydrodynamic radii of SG and GrB·SG complexes were estimated using dynamic laser light scattering, in which one measures the temporal fluctuations of the intensity of light scattered by a sample. Measurements were made using the BIC-200SM goniometer equipped with a 400-channel BI-9000AT digital autocorrelator and photon counter (Brookhaven Instruments Corp., Holtsville, NY). The last eight channels were used for baseline correction. A laser beam of light at 514.5 nm, delivered by a 3-watt argon-ion laser wavelength, was used. Samples of SG at a concentration of 40 μg/ml (based on GAG content), in 200 μl, were used for scattering experiments. Prior to measurements, the samples were subjected to microcentrifugation to ensure separation of any particulate matter that might interfere in the analysis. The digital autocorrelation data acquired was analyzed using the Dynamic Light Scattering software, to derive the particle size distribution. The polydispersity within the sample was assessed by analyzing the data using the non-negative least-squares (21Lawson C.L. Hanson R.J. Solving Least Squares Problem. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1974Google Scholar) or CONTIN (22Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2494) Google Scholar) algorithms supplied with the instrument software. The stoichiometry of interaction of GrB with CS or SG was analyzed on a native 1% agarose gel, by exploiting the shift in mobility of the complexes based on an effective change in the mass as well as charge of the complexes. Briefly, complexes were prepared under the conditions of fixed GrB and varying SG or CS concentrations as well as fixed SG or CS and varying the GrB concentrations. Serial 2-fold dilutions of either SG/CS or GrB were prepared and then mixed with a fixed concentration of GrB or SG/CS, in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The complexes were then analyzed on a 1% agarose gel (prepared and added to Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer and adjusted to pH 7.4), stained with 0.02% toluidine blue in 3% acetic acid, destained in 3% acetic acid, and subsequently counterstained with Coomassie Blue (Gelcode). Purified SG as well as GAGs were derivatized with biotinamidocaproylhydrazide according to the procedure described in a previous study (23Martin L. Blanpain C. Garnier P. Wittamer V. Parmentier M. Vita C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6303-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled SG and GAGs were separated from unreacted material by Superose-6 gel-filtration chromatography. Derivatization was confirmed by Western blot analysis of labeled material, which was analyzed on an agarose gel, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and probed using streptavidin-HRP. The degree of biotinylation was quantitated by exploiting the fluorescence enhancement of streptavidin-FITC, on biotin binding. Briefly, a standard curve was generated using a fixed concentration of streptavidin-FITC (100 nm), incubated with varying concentrations of d-biotin (0–400 nm), in a fluorescence microtiter plate. The fluorescence of FITC at 520 nm, following excitation at 495 nm, was measured using a SPECTRAmax GEMINI XS fluorescence plate reader from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). The concentration of accessible biotin was estimated from the fluorescence of a mixture of streptavidin-FITC with the labeled SG of GAG. Surface plasmon resonance studies were performed using the IASys Auto+ instrument (Thermo Labsystems Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK) in a dual cuvette. Purified SG was derivatized with biotin-amidocaproylhydrazide essentially as described for biotinylation of heparin (23Martin L. Blanpain C. Garnier P. Wittamer V. Parmentier M. Vita C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6303-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). SPR studies were performed using a biotin cuvette. Total reaction volumes were typically 50 μl. Streptavidin (10 μg/ml, 500 ng) was first immobilized onto the biotin cuvette. The cuvette contents were replaced with buffer to remove unbound streptavidin. Following three washes, biotinylated SG (10 μg/ml, 500 ng) was added to the streptavidin-coated cuvette. Unbound SG was removed similarly by replacing the contents with buffer. Increasing concentrations of a stock solution of GrB (100–200 μg/ml) were then added to both the sample (immobilized SG) as well as the reference cuvette (streptavidin alone). The data was analyzed using the FastFit and Fastplot software from IASys. Images of gels and immunoblots were captured either with a Kodak digital camera or Saphir Ultra 2 flatbed scanner and then exported to Adobe Photoshop 6.0. The images were then placed for final presentation in Adobe Illustrator 9.0 using a Macintosh Power G4 computer. To characterize the interactions between GrB and SG, particularly the affinity of binding and the number of GrB molecules that can bind each SG, we purified the proteoglycan from YT-INDY cells, a natural killer cell line that appears to contain GrB and PFN bound to SG within cytoplasmic granules. In addition, these cells also constitutively secrete SG into culture medium, providing a convenient resource. We isolated SG from YT cell serum-free supernatants, essentially as described by Oynebraten et al. (13Oynebraten I. Hansen B. Smedsrod B. Uhlin-Hansen L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for the purification of SG from a THP monocytic cell line. The purified SG was quantitated in terms of its GAG content using the Azure A dye binding assay (see “Materials and Methods”). The isolated SG migrated as a diffuse band in 1% agarose gel with a molecular mass of 200–350 kDa (Fig.1 A). The position for SG was comparable to that observed for the previously characterized (13Oynebraten I. Hansen B. Smedsrod B. Uhlin-Hansen L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) counterpart from the human monocytic cell line THP-1 (Fig.1 A). Endoglycosidase digestion (see Fig. 1 B) with chondroitinase ABC, heparinase, and heparitinase further confirmed that the protein contained predominantly chondroitin sulfate side chains. The overall characteristics of the isolated PG thus were similar in nature to SG characterized from THP cells (13Oynebraten I. Hansen B. Smedsrod B. Uhlin-Hansen L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). SG, like most other proteoglycans, is heterogeneous due to variations in the number of attached GAGs and their varying chain lengths and degree of sulfation. To assess the heterogeneity of isolated SG as well as isolated CS-GAG chains, we used capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE is a powerful technique widely used for GAG analysis (24Mao W. Thanawiroon C. Linhardt R.J. Biomed. Chromatogr. 2002; 16: 77-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the normal polarity mode the sample is injected at the anode and detected at the cathode. Under alkaline conditions, the oppositely directed electrophoretic and electro-osmotic forces resolve the species, on the basis of charge to mass (e/m) ratio. For a polyanionic mixture, the species with the least charge density (e/m) elutes first, followed by species with increasing charge densities. Homogeneous samples, with a well-defined molecular composition, give sharp peaks, with peak widths of a few seconds, whereas heterogeneous polydisperse samples, including GAGs, elute as broad humps. CE analysis of our isolated SG, showed a broad peak between 50 and 54 min, with a peak width of ∼4 min (see Fig.2 A), rather than a peak width of a few seconds, indicating that the isolated SG was highly polydispersed. The inset in Fig. 2 A shows the elution monitored at both A 280 (peptide absorbance) and A 214 (peptide backbone and sugar residues). CS chains released from the core peptide by base hydrolysis migrated similarly to commercial CS (M r ∼ 25,000) (from Sturgeon notochord, Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) on an agarose gel (see Fig. 2 B). This result was confirmed by gel-permeation chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) (data not shown). The GAG chains released by base hydrolysis of SG also eluted as a broad polydisperse peak at ∼18.4 min, in a position similar to intact SG, presumably due to a comparable overall e/m ratio. When monitored at A 280, the sample lacked a discernible peak confirming the signal was due to free GAG and not undigested SG. For comparison we injected commercial CS (from S. notochord) as shown in Fig. 2 C. The elution time for commercial CS (∼19.5 min), which was isolated from a non-human source, is a slightly higher retention time (shifted by ∼1 min), presumably because of a higher degree of sulfation leading to a greater negative charge and therefore an increased e/m ratio. Agarose gel analysis showed that the average molecular mass of isolated SG was 200–350 kDa, similar to our biglycan standard. However, under gel-filtration analysis on a Superose 6 column, SG eluted in the void volume with an estimated molecular mass exceeding 106 kDa (data not shown). This difference is likely due to the extended topology of the chondroitin sulfate chains, occupying a much larger molecular volume in the aqueous phase. Based on differential glycosylation and variance in the total number of GAG chains per core peptide, one can predict significant heterogeneity and polydispersity. To study the molecular size distribution, we performed sedimentation velocity studies on the isolated SG, using various concentrations of the proteoglycan. The van Holde-Weischet distribution plot is shown in Fig.3 A. The results indicate that the sample lacks concentration dependence and exhibits substantial heterogeneity due either to heterogeneity in molecular weight, frictional heterogeneity, or, most likely, both. The S value distribution increases from a small S value of around 2 S to more than 25 S. The molecular weights of the particles can be calculated from Svedberg's law,s/D=[M(1−V¯*ρ]/RTEquation 1 where s is the sedimentation coefficient; Dis the diffusion coefficient (given by D =RT/Nf, where f is the frictional coefficient); M is the molecular weight; vbar is the partial specific volume at experimental temperature T,rho is the density of the buffer, and R is the gas constant. To calculate the M r of the particles from thes values, knowledge of vbar and the diffusion coefficient is necessary. Theoretically, a lower limit may be estimated by assuming that all molecules in the sample sediment into spherical shapes. Based on the method of Cohn and Edsall (25Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York1943Crossref Google Scholar) and as implemented in UltraScan,2 a vbar value of 0.7346 cm3/g can be safely assumed. However, SG consists predominantly of GAG sugars; therefore, to calculate theM r distribution of SG, we used a literature"
https://openalex.org/W1997908375,"Lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease categorized into multiple subtypes of cancers which likely arise from distinct patterns of genetic alterations and disruptions. Precedent exists for a role of β-catenin, a downstream component of the Wnt signaling pathway that serves as a transcriptional co-activator with TCF/LEF, in several human cancers including colon carcinomas. In this study, we observed that β-catenin was highly and uniformly expressed in a panel of NSCLC cell lines and primary lung tumors. By contrast, γ-catenin was weakly expressed or absent in several NSCLC cell lines and immunohistochemical analysis of primary NSCLC tumors revealed negligible to weak γ-catenin staining in ∼30% of the specimens. Treatment of NSCLC cells expressing reduced γ-catenin protein with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5aza2dc), a DNA methylation inhibitor, or trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, increased γ-catenin protein content in NSCLC cells with low γ-catenin expression. Significantly, the activity of a β-catenin/TCF-dependent luciferase reporter was markedly elevated in the NSCLC cell lines that underexpressed γ-catenin relative to those lines that highly expressed γ-catenin. Moreover, transfection of these cells with a γ-catenin expression plasmid reduced the elevated TCF activity by 85% and strongly inhibited cell growth on tissue culture plastic as well as anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. This study shows that γ-catenin can function as an inhibitor of β-catenin/TCF-dependent gene transcription and highlights γ-catenin as a potentially novel tumor suppressor protein in a subset of human NSCLC cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2007744273,"We have identified three members of the AGAP subfamily of ASAP family ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating proteins (Arf GAPs). In addition to the Arf GAP domain, these proteins contain GTP-binding protein-like, ankyrin repeat and pleckstrin homology domains. Here, we have characterized the ubiquitously expressed AGAP1/KIAA1099. AGAP1 had Arf GAP activity toward Arf1>Arf5>Arf6. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid synergistically stimulated GAP activity. As found for other ASAP family Arf GAPs, the pleckstrin homology domain was necessary for activity. Deletion of the GTP-binding protein-like domain affected lipid dependence of Arf GAP activity. In vivoeffects of AGAP1 were distinct from other ASAP family Arf GAPs.

The Arf proteins can be divided into classes I, II, and III on the basis of primary structure (1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Google Scholar, 2Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6228-6234Google Scholar). In normal physiology, Arfs regulate membrane traffic (2Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Google Scholar, 4Randazzo P.A.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 855-866Google Scholar, 7Norman J.C. Jones D. Barry S.T. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1981-1995Google Scholar, 8Turner C.E. West K.A. Brown M.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 593-599Google Scholar). A single Arf gene product can function at multiple sites within a cell and affect both membrane trafficking and actin remodeling. Furthermore, multiple Arfs can exist within a single cell. Therefore, regulatory mechanisms are likely specific to Arf gene products and cellular site. Because efficient function of Arf requires the controlled binding and hydrolysis of GTP by Arf, the accessory proteins that catalyze this cycle, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (9Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Google Scholar) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (4Randazzo P.A. Nie Z. Miura K. Chu V.W.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 277-281Google Scholar), are candidates for mediating these two levels of regulation. The roles of Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GAPs in Arf and site-specific regulation are being examined. The first Arf GAP identified was Arf GAP1 (12Cukierman E. Huber I. Totman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Google Scholar). The protein consists of a catalytic domain and a targeting domain, both of which are necessary for the regulation of Arf1 in the Golgi apparatus (13Huber I. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Aoe T. Hsu V.W.

The ASAP proteins are further divided on the basis of additional domains. The ACAPs have a coiled coil domain (21Jackson T.R. Brown F.D. Nie Z. Miura K. Foroni L. Sun J. Hsu V.W. Donaldson J.G. Randazzo P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 627-638Google Scholar), the ASAPs have Src homology 3 and proline-rich domains (19Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Google Scholar), and the ARAPs have Rho GAP, Ras-associating domains, and five PH domains (22Miura K. Jacques K.M. Stauffer S. Kubosaki A. Zhu K. Hirsch D.S.

Cell. 2001; 9: 95-108Google Scholar). Each of the ASAPs has been found to affect the actin cytoskeleton. ACAPs have effects secondary to the inactivation of Arf6 (21Jackson T.R. Brown F.D. Nie Z.

ARAPs have two effects; one is to inactivate Rho, and the other is to increase Cdc42 activity as a consequence of Arf GAP activity (22Miura K. Jacques K.M. Stauffer S. Kubosaki A. Zhu K. Hirsch D.S.

Cell. 2001; 9: 95-108Google Scholar). Here, we examine a member of a fourth subgroup within the ASAPs, the AGAPs. This subgroup contains a GLD (GTP-binding protein-like domain) N-terminal to the core of PH, Arf GAP, and ANK repeat domains. The proteins are also distinguished from other ASAP family members in having a split PH domain. We found that AGAP1, like other ASAP family members, is a phosphoinositide-dependent Arf GAP and affects the actin cytoskeleton. However, distinct from other Arf GAPs, AGAP1 induces and localizes to Rab4/AP1 containing structures presumed to be endosomes and specifically alters stress fibers. Both effects require Arf GAP activity; the effect on stress fibers is partly dependent on the GLD of AGAP1. Based on these results, AGAP1 is a possible link between endocytic traffic and the actin cytoskeleton. KIAA1099 cDNA clone was kindly provided by Dr. Takahiro Nagase at the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). The coding region for AGAP1 or different domains were amplified by polymerase chain reactions and subcloned into the EcoRI andNotI sites of pCI (Promega, Madison, WI) with a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) for mammalian expression or into pGEX4T-1 (AmershamBiosciences) for expression as a GST fusion protein in bacteria. pCDNA3-HA-Erk2 and v-Ras were gifts from Dr. Douglas Lowy at the NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). GFP-Rab4, GFP-Rab5, and GFP-Rab11 were generously provided by Dr. Juan Bonifacino at the NICHD, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing at the NCI, National Institutes of Health sequencing core facility. Monoclonal M5 anti-FLAG epitope antibody and M2 anti-FLAG affinity matrix were from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody and anti-hemagglutinin affinity matrix were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-Ras and anti-phosphorylated MAP kinase antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti EEA1, Rab4, Rab5, and Rab11 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-βCOP was from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Anti-γ-adaptin was from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and rhodamine-conjugated transferrin, Alexa-488, and Alexa-594 secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). Rabbit antisera 1158 against residues 784–804 of AGAP1 conjugated to a C-terminal cysteine residue were raised at Covance (Denver, PA). The antisera recognized the FLAG epitope-tagged AGAP1 or GST-AGAP1 by immunoblot, and the signals were blocked by the peptide to which the antisera were raised, whereas the peptide corresponding to residues 45 to 68 failed to compete for the signal. Tissue cDNA panels were obtained from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). Specific primers were designed to amplify nucleotides 648 to 1245 (corresponding to codons 27 to 224) of the mouse cDNA and from 648 to 1369 of the human cDNA. The forward primer used for both the mouse and the human cDNAs was ACATCTACTCCATCTACGAGCTGC (nucleotides 648 to 671 of KIAA1099). The reverse primer for mouse cDNA was ACGTCCTGGAAGACCCGCTCCAC (corresponding to nucleotides 1245 to 1223 of KIAA1099). The reverse primer for human cDNA was GCTGATGTGCACGGCAGACACC (nucleotides 1369 to 1347 of KIAA1099). Thermal cycling was performed under the conditions specified by the manual from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. PCR products were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. NIH 3T3, COS7, U87, and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C with 5% CO2. PC6 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% FBS at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and harvested 24 h later for reseeding, immunoblotting, or immunoprecipitation. Cells were deprived of serum for 12 h before growth factor stimulation. Cells were visualized by staining with rhodamine-phalloidin, and transfected cells were detected using an antibody to the epitope tag. Cells were examined by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss Pascal confocal mounted on an Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with an 100× Plan-Neofluar oil immersion lens (Carl Zeiss). For PDGF-induced dorsal ruffle assays, cells were incubated for 6 h and then treated with 10 ng/ml PDGF for 4 min. For transferrin uptake, NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with regular medium for 6 h after reseeding. Then the cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 30 min before incubation with transferrin for another 30 min. Cells were then washed and fixed with 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and anti-FLAG antibody (25Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Google Scholar). At least 100 cells were counted from at least two separate coverslips to quantify differences in ruffling and stress fibers. N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged AGAP1 (amino acids 1–804), [ΔGLD]AGAP1 (amino acids 347–804), [ΔGLD,ΔPH]AGAP1 (amino acids 556–804), or GLD (amino acids 69–317) were overexpressed in HEK293T cells by transient transfection. The cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG affinity gel at 4 °C overnight. The tagged proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide for 30 min at 4 °C. For GST fusion proteins AGAP1 (1–804), [ΔGLD]AGAP1 (347–804), or GLD (69–317) were expressed in BL21 cells and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Biosciences). Both GST fusion proteins and FLAG epitope-tagged proteins were used for Arf GAP assays with nearly identical results. Arf proteins used in the assays were purified as described before (26Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 128-135Google Scholar). Point mutants and truncation mutants of AGAP1 were expressed in HEK293T and BL21 cells. Based on homology modeling, the change in arginine 599 should not affect the structure of the protein. Consistent with the mutation not affecting the conformation of the protein, GST-[ΔGLD]AGAP1 and GST-[ΔGLDR599K]AGAP1 bound Arf·[35S]GTPγS to an equal extent. The GST-GLD and GST-[ΔGLD,ΔPH]AGAP1 behave as a single population of proteins on sizing columns, eluting in symmetrical peaks in a volume consistent with the molecular weight. Based on work with a similar domain on PAPα (20Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabaatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Google Scholar), we assume that the [ΔGLD,ΔPH]AGAP1 protein is folded properly. We cannot assert that the isolated GLD domain contains the native fold as present in the full-length protein. Tests for nucleotide binding were performed with both this isolated domain and the full-length protein with similar negative results. Nucleotides copurified with proteins were detected by the method described (27Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Proteins were denatured by the addition of 1m formic acid and separated from nucleotides by centrifugation. The supernatant was lyophilized and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.2 mm tetrabutylammonium hydrogen, 3% (v/v) acetonitril, and 0.2 mm NaN3. The nucleotides were then fractionated on a C18 column developed by isocratic elution with the resuspension buffer. Absorbance was monitored at 252 nm. Under this condition, the retention times for GDP, GTP, ADP, and ATP were 6.5, 10.2, 9.5, and 17 min, respectively. Arf was used as a positive control. Nucleotide binding was measured using GST-GLD and GST-AGAP1 fusion proteins bound to 10 μl of glutathione beads. The immobilized proteins were incubated with 0.25 μm radiolabeled GTP, GTPγS, or ATP in 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, either 0.5 (low Mg2+) or 2 mm MgCl2 (high Mg2+), 0.1% Triton X-100, 360 μm PA, and 45 μmPIP2 in a total volume of 50 μl. After 5 min at room temperature, the reactions were centrifuged briefly at 500 ×g, and 40 μl of the supernatant was removed. The radioactivity in the supernatant and the remaining pellet was quantified by scintillation spectroscopy. Similarly, Arf·GTPγS binding to AGAP1 was measured by immobilizing GST-AGAP1 on glutathione beads, incubating the protein under the same conditions as the GAP assay with Arf·[35S]GTPγS, and determining the amount of Arf·[35S]GTPγS associated with the beads by scintillation spectroscopy. Nitrocellulose filter binding was performed as described (26Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 128-135Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was incubated with radiolabeled nucleotide in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 or 2.0 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The reaction was terminated after 30 min at 30 °C by addition of ice-cold binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Bound nucleotide was determined by rapid filtration on nitrocellulose filters and quantified with a scintillation counter. Arf GAP activity was measured as described (28Randazzo P.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 413-419Google Scholar). Arf proteins were preloaded with [α-32P]GTP by incubation at 30 °C for 30 min in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, 25 mm KCl, 1.25 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 3 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate. The preloaded Arf was diluted in a reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm GTP, 1 mmdithiothreitol. Reactions were terminated after 2 to 4 min by adding ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein-bound nucleotide was trapped on nitrocellulose filters, released into 2 m formic acid, fractionated by chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates, and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). An equal amount of different forms of AGAP1 was used when comparing their activities. The quantity of immunoprecipitated proteins was compared by immunoblotting. Immunoblot signals were visualized with the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL). All lipids were presented as mixed micelles with Triton X-100. All experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism. We have defined ASAP-type Arf GAPs to be proteins containing a core of a PH, Arf GAP, and ANK repeat domains. Database searches revealed three cDNA-encoding proteins containing these structures, KIAA1099 (accession number AB029022), KIAA0167 (accession number D79989), and M-RIP (accession number AF359283). These three proteins are distinguished from other ASAP family proteins in two ways. First, they contain an N-terminal GLD (GTP-binding protein-like domain). Second, the PH domain is split (Fig. 1A, bold in box). We propose calling these proteins AGAPs for Arf GAP with GTP-binding protein-like, ANK repeat and PH domains. In this nomenclature, KIAA1099 and KIAA0167 are AGAP1 and AGAP2. The GLDs of the AGAPs, though highly similar to Ras family proteins, have some critical differences in primary structure. The GLD of AGAP1 is 51% similar and 27% identical to K-Ras, AGAP2 is 42% similar and 28% identical to Rab9, and M-RIP is 47% similar and 27% identical to H-Ras (Fig. 1B). Three GTP binding motif consensus sequences are well conserved, GXXXXGK(S/T) (residues 78–85 in AGAP1; see Fig. 1C, bold), DXXG (residues 124–127 in AGAP1; see Fig. 1C, bold), and TCAT (residues 210–213 in AGAP1; see Fig. 1C, bold). However, glutamine 61 of Ras (threonine 61 in Rap) is replaced with a proline in AGAPs, and there is no identifiable NKXD motif. In AGAP1, the stretches over switch I and II (Fig. 1C,box) have 25 and 17% identity to K-Ras (29Wittinghofer A. Nassar N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 488-491Google Scholar). Residues in switch I critical for interacting with the Ras effector Raf, Tyr-32, Thr-35, and Asp-38 in Ras are Glu, Glu, and Arg in AGAP1. The PH domains of the AGAPs are distinct from those in other ASAP family Arf GAPs. They are split and, therefore, extend over 189 residues (Fig. 1A, bold in box). AGAP1 contains nine of the ten residues identified in the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) binding consensus sequence (30Lietzke S.E. Bose S. Cronin T. Klarlund J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 385-394Google Scholar,31Ferguson K.M. Kavran J.M. Sankaran V.G. Fournier E. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 373-384Google Scholar) including a tyrosine that is present in all identified PIP3 binding PH domains (Fig. 1D). The difference is conservative, with a lysine substituting for an arginine (Fig. 1D, arrow). We have characterized the product of the AGAP1 gene, a protein with 804 amino acids (Fig. 1A) and a calculated molecular mass of 89 kDa. Expressed sequence tag database search revealed a mouse homologue of AGAP1 (accession BF322239), which is 96% identical (179/187) to AGAP1 at the amino acid level and 87% (489/559) identical to AGAP1 at the nucleic acid level for the 187 amino acids encoded by the expressed sequence tag. Based on reverse transcriptase-PCR using cDNA from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, AGAP1 is expressed in all the tissues tested (data not shown). AGAP1 expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein and in mammalian cells as an epitope-tagged protein was purified and examined as an Arf GAP. Both bacterially and mammalian-expressed AGAP1 contained Arf GAP activity. Activity was dependent on phospholipids. In the absence of other phospholipids, 10 and 45 μmPIP3 stimulated GAP activity to a greater extent than did PIP2. However, phosphatidic acid potentiated PIP2 stimulation, which was not observed for PIP3 (Fig. 2A). An interaction between PA and PIP2 was indicated by two-way ANOVA analysis. The synergy was specific for PA. Phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) had less of an effect on PIP2-stimulated activity (Fig. 2B). Representative proteins from each class of Arf, Arf1, Arf5, and Arf6, were used as substrates for AGAP1 under optimal conditions. Both bacterially expressed GST-AGAP1 (Fig. 2C) and mammalian-expressed FLAG-AGAP1 (not shown) used Arf1 as the preferred substrate. We next examined the structural requirements for Arf GAP activity as defined for other ASAP family members. Different AGAP1 constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells, immunoprecipitated with M2 gel, and eluted with FLAG peptide. Equal amounts of protein were used in these assays. We found that AGAP1 was similar to other ASAP family members in three structural requirements as follows. (i) A zinc finger was necessary. The zinc finger motif could be disrupted by substituting a serine for a cysteine. This mutation resulted in a protein with no activity (Fig. 2D). (ii) The arginine five residues C-terminal to the last cysteine defining the zinc finger was also required for activity. A conservative substitution of a lysine resulted in a protein with no activity (Fig. 2D). This mutation was unlikely to cause the protein to misfold. Homology modeling (Fig. 2E) was carried out against the crystal structure of the Arf GAP domain of PAPβ (32Mandiyan V. Andreev J. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6890-6898Google Scholar), using Homology/Discover module within Insight II (Accerlys, San Diego, CA). Based on this result, a conservative mutation of arginine 599 to lysine is expected to have minimal effect on the stability and structure of the protein. Furthermore, mutation of arginine 599 to lysine did not affect the ability of GST-[ΔGLD]AGAP1 to bind to Arf·GTPγS. GST-[ΔGLD]AGAP1 (1.5 μm) and GST-[R599KΔGLD]AGAP1 (1.5 μm) bound 21.4 ± 1.8% and 19.9 ± 2.5% of the Arf·[35S]GTPγS in an in vitro binding assay (33Jacques K.M. Nie Z. Stauffer S. Hirsch D.S. Chen L.X. Stanley K.T. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). (iii) The PH domain was necessary. Whereas the protein comprised of the PH, Arf GAP (zinc finger motif), and ANK repeats ([ΔGLD]AGAP1) had activity comparable with full-length AGAP1, a protein comprised of the Arf GAP and ANK repeats ([ΔGLD, ΔPH]AGAP1) did not have any detectable activity (Fig. 2D). Based on analogy with PAPα, we had no reason to suspect that [ΔGLD,ΔPH]AGAP1 was misfolded. Similar results were obtained with the GST-tagged proteins purified from bacteria, except for [C594S]AGAP1, which was insoluble (not shown), consistent with the suspected unfolding of the zinc finger-containing domain. Because of the similarity of the GLD to K-Ras, we examined AGAP1 for analogous function. First we tested for nucleotide binding under a number of conditions, including the presence or absence of detergent, and/or phosphoinositides, in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 or Mg2+ buffered to 1 μm with EDTA. No high affinity binding of GDP, GTP, or GTPγS was detected by a nitrocellulose filter binding assay under any of these conditions. The presence of nucleotide on purified AGAP1 was examined by denaturing the protein in formic acid and detecting released nucleotide by HPLC. No GDP, GTP, ADP, or ATP was detected on purified GLD. We also could not detect any low affinity ATP, GTP, or GTPγS binding in equilibrium dialysis experiments (not shown). Finally, no GTPase activity was detected in full-length AGAP1 or the isolated GLD (not shown). Similarly, we could not detect any effect on the Ras phosphorylation cascade. Overexpression of AGAP1 in PC6 or COS7 cells had no effect on MAP kinase phosphorylation observed in cells maintained in serum-free medium, either in the presence or absence of epidermal growth factor (34Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Google Scholar) or nerve growth factor (35Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Google Scholar). AGAP1 also had no effect on MAP kinase phosphorylation induced by coexpressing v-Ras (36Qian X. Esteban L. Vass W.C. Upadhyaya C. Papageorge A.G. Yienger K. Ward J.M. Lowy D.R. Santos E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 642-654Google Scholar) (data not shown). The GLD did influence the Arf GAP activity of AGAP1. As noted above, the protein lacking the GLD, [ΔGLD]AGAP1, had GAP activity. The activity was stimulated by phospholipids. However, stimulation by PIP2 did not require, nor was it synergistic with, PA. At concentration range from 11.25 to 90 μm, PIP2activated [ΔGLD]AGAP1 GAP activity to a similar extent regardless of whether PA was present (Fig. 2F). To examine the in vivo function of AGAP1, we first examined the expression of endogenous AGAP1 by Western blot using an antibody raised to a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of AGAP1. In lysates from U87, HeLa, and HEK293T cells, two forms of the protein were found. One band was detected at the predicted molecular mass and one additional band was at a slightly greater molecular mass than predicted. This difference could represent either a covalent modification or splicing variation. In NIH 3T3 cells, the molecular mass was slightly greater than predicted for AGAP1 (Fig. 3A). A species of the same molecular mass was noted in skeletal muscle (data not shown). The difference in molecular mass is most likely the result of different splicing of the message. 2Z. Nie and P. A. Randazzo, unpublished observation. In addition, immunoprecipitated FLAG-AGAP1 and purified GST-[ΔGLD]AGAP1 were also recognized by the antisera. These spe"

CEP1347, a K252a derivative, retains neuroprotective properties, but does not inhibit TrkA. CEP1347 has recently been shown to directly inhibit MAPKKKs, including MLK3, but the effect of K252a on MAPKKKs remains unknown. K252a and CEP1347 not only prevent death, but also facilitate neurite outgrowth and maintenance, somal hypertrophy, and neurotransmitter synthesis. The biochemical basis for these trophic effects remains unknown. We have compared the effects of CEP1347 and K252a on MLK and JNK signaling and on neurotrophic pathways that support survival and growth. Our data show that K252a is a potent inhibitor of MLK3 activity <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> (IC<sub>50</sub> ∼ 5 nm). However, we also found that K252a and CEP1347 activate Akt and ERK and show that blockade of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or MEK activity ablates the effect of K252a and CEP1347 on cell survival. Activation of Akt and ERK occurs through an MLK-independent pathway that may involve c-Src. Together, these data show that the neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects of K252a and CEP1347 involve activation of several neurotrophic signaling pathways."

As2O3 is believed to function primarily by promoting apoptosis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this report, using cDNA arrays, we have examined the changes in gene expression profiles triggered by clinically achievable doses of As2O3 in acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells. CASPASE-10 expression was found to be potently induced by As2O3. Accordingly, caspase-10 activity also substantially increased in response to As2O3 treatment. A selective inhibitor of caspase-10, Z-AEVD-FMK, effectively blocked caspase-3 activation and significantly attenuated As2O3-triggered apoptosis. Interestingly, the treatment of NB4 cells with As2O3 markedly increased histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10, an event that is associated with acetylation of the lysine 14 residue. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that As2O3 potently enhances histone H3 phosphoacetylation at the CASPASE-10 locus. These results suggest that the effect of As2O3 on histone H3 phosphoacetylation at the CASPASE-10 gene may play an important role in the induction of apoptosis and thus contribute to its therapeutic effects on acute promyelocytic leukemia.

The vast majority of APL patients harbor the chromosomal translocation t(15,17)(q22;q21) involving the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) gene on chromosome 15 and the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene on chromosome 17, generally giving rise to two fusion genes, PML-RARα andRARα-PML (1de The H.

Science. 1991; 254: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Studies using transgenic mice have demonstrated that the protein product of the PML-RARαfusion gene is primarily responsible for the leukemogenic property of this characteristic translocation (4Brown D. Kogan S. Lagasse E. Weissman I. Alcalay M. Pelicci P.G. Atwater S. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2551-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 5He L.Z. Tribioli C.

All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a physiologically active derivative of vitamin A, can induce complete remission in most APL patients associated with an enhancement of differentiation pathways (6Degos L. Wang Z.Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7140-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recent studies (7Powell B.L. Curr. Opin.

Gurrieri C. Pandolfi P.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7216-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have provided strong evidence that the induction of leukemia by the PML-RARα protein relies on its ability to repress gene transcription by recruiting transcription repressor complexes. Pharmacological doses of ATRA stimulate the release of the transcription repressor complexes from PML-RARα, thereby activating the transcription of genes critical for normal granulocytic differentiation. However, ATRA is not curative, and resistance rapidly develops usually within 10 months of therapy (2Soignet S.L. Oncologist. 2001; 6: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,6Degos L. Wang Z.Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7140-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, alternative therapies are necessary. Recently, As2O3 was identified as a potent anti-leukemic agent for treating not only newly diagnosed but also relapsed APL patients (2Soignet S.L.

As2O3 induces a drastic reorganization of the nucleus characterized by restoration of intact PML nuclear bodies followed by a progressive degradation of the PML-RARα fusion protein (14Shao W. Fanelli M. Ferrara F.F. Riccioni R. Rosenauer A. Davison K. Lamph W.W. Waxman S. Pelicci P.G. Lo C.F. Avvisati G. Testa U. Peschle C. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Nervi C. Miller Jr., W.H. J. Natl.

Although As2O3 induces partial differentiation of leukemic cells (13Zhang T.D. Chen G.Q. Wang Z.G. Wang Z.Y. Chen S.J. Chen Z. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7146-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the apoptosis-promoting effect of As2O3 is believed to play a prominent role in the remission of APL as large numbers of apoptotic myelocytes have been documented in bone marrow and peripheral blood of As2O3-treated APL patients (2Soignet S.L. Oncologist. 2001; 6: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Chen Z. Chen G.Q. Shen Z.X. Chen S.J. Wang Z.Y. Semin. Hematol. 2001; 38: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhang T.D.

As2O3 has been shown to trigger the early collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (16Jing Y. Dai J. Chalmers-Redman R.M. Tatton W.G. Waxman S.

Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To elucidate the key molecular events involved in mediating As2O3-induced apoptosis, we have employed the APL-derived NB4 cell line exposed to clinically relevant concentrations of As2O3 and analyzed the changes in gene expression profiles using cDNA array. CASPASE-10 was among the genes up-regulated with this treatment. Interestingly, treatment with As2O3 also resulted in a significant increase in histone H3 phosphoacetylation, an event that is associated with altered gene transcription (19Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 20Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol.

Importantly, selective inhibition of caspase-10 substantially abolished As2O3-triggered caspase-3 activation and significantly reduced As2O3-induced apoptosis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that As2O3 potently enhances histone H3 phosphoacetylation at the CASPASE-10 locus. These results suggest that As2O3-induced histone H3 phosphoacetylation may be implicated in altering gene transcription profile and apoptosis and play an important role in the therapeutic effect of As2O3 on APL. NB4 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mm glutamine. As2O3 was from Sigma, and Z-AEVD-FMK was from Enzyme Systems (Livermore, CA). Flow cytometry and estimation of sub-G1 apoptotic populations were performed as described previously (22Gong J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Where indicated, percentages of dead cells were assessed by direct cell counting after trypan blue staining using a hemacytometer. For caspase activity determinations, 100-μg aliquots of cell lysate were prepared and used following the manufacturers' recommendations to assay caspase-2 (BioVision, Mountain View, CA), caspase-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or caspase-10 activity (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) by fluorometry. Total RNA was isolated using a NucleoSpin RNA II isolation kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Caspase-10 mRNA was detected through the simultaneous use of two radiolabeled oligonucleotides (5′-CAGGAATACTGTCCTGCAGGGAAGTGGGTGCCTGCTCAGGGTTCAGA-3′ and 5′-TGCCGTATGATATAGAGGAGTTCTGCCAGGAAGAAAGTTCCTCACT-3′) as probes. Signals were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). Caspases-2, -3, and DNA fragmentation factor-45 were detected by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Caspase-8 was detected by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Active caspase-3 was detected by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the active/cleaved caspase-3 (Asp-175) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Modified histone H3 was detected by Western blotting as described previously (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Crude histone proteins were extracted as described previously (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and separated through electrophoresis using 10% NuPAGE gels and MES buffer (Invitrogen). Phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was detected by Western blotting using an antibody specific for Ser-10-phosphorylated histone H3 (Cell Signaling). Histone H3 phosphoacetylation was detected by Western blotting using an antibody, which is specific for histone H3 phosphorylated at Ser-10 and acetylated at Lys-14 (Clontech). Histone H3 hyperacetylation was detected by Western blotting using an antibody specific for histone H3 that is acetylated at both Lys-9 and Lys-14 (Clontech). DNase-treated total RNA (5 μg), prepared from either untreated or As2O3-treated cells, was used to synthesize cDNA probes using reverse transcriptase, [α-33P]dATP, and a specific CDS primer mix for genes represented on the Atlas human cancer 1.2 array (Clontech) containing 1,176 human cDNAs. Arrays were hybridized and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions and were visualized and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Signal intensities were normalized to the signals of housekeeping genes in each membrane, and simple ratios (treated relative to untreated) were calculated. The array analysis was performed at least twice for each time point. ChIP was performed using 1.5×108 cells as described previously (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Ten percent of the chromatin solution was used for isolating input DNA, and the remainder was used for performing ChIP assays. ChIP procedures were carried out either using 10 μl of rabbit pre-immune serum or 100 μl of purified antibody specifically recognizing phosphoacetyl-histone H3 (p-Ser-10/Ac-Lys-14) (Clontech). Immunoprecipitated DNA was heated at 65 °C for ≥6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links, extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and dissolved in water. Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix and GeneAmp® 5700 Sequencing Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers 5′-TGCTTACCAGCGGCTACAC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCCCTACCCCAGAAAC-3′ were used to amplify theCASPASE-10 genomic DNA spanning a 151-bp region in the second intron of CASPASE-10 (24Hadano S. Yanagisawa Y. Skaug J. Fichter K. Nasir J. Martindale D. Koop B.F. Scherer S.W. Nicholson D.W. Rouleau G.A. Ikeda J. Hayden M.R. Genomics. 2001; 71: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Humanβ-GLOBIN was amplified using primers 5′-GGCAAGGTGAACGTGGATGAAGTTGGTG-3′ and 5′-GGAGTGGACAGATCCCCAAAGGACTCAAAG-3′, which span a 234-bp region from the first to the second exon of the human β-GLOBINgene (25Heusterspreute M. Derclaye I. Gala J.L. Van Geet C. Ferrant A. Malchaire Y. Thonnard J. Vaerman J.L. Philippe M. Hum. Genet. 1996; 98: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was carried out using these parameters: 10 min at 95 °C followed by 45 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 15 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 30 s). Upon the completion of the PCR reactions, PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and visualized under UV light to confirm the quality of the PCR amplification. Treatment of NB4 cells with As2O3 led to a time-dependent cleavage of caspase-2 and caspase-3 as indicated by the progressive decrease in the unprocessed caspases. However, it did not affect the expression of another apoptosis-related protein, DNA fragmentation factor-45 (Fig. 1 A). Confirming the previous report that As2O3activates caspase-3 in APL cells in vivo (12Soignet S.L. Maslak P. Wang Z.G. Jhanwar S. Calleja E. Dardashti L.J. Corso D. DeBlasio A. Gabrilove J. Scheinberg D.A. Pandolfi P.P. Warrell Jr., R.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), we observed a substantial increase in caspase-3 activity after 24 h in As2O3-treated NB4 cells. The activity of caspase-3 reached its maximal levels at 48–72 h (Fig. 1 B). In addition, treatment with As2O3 caused the appearance of an apoptotic sub-G1 population (Fig.1 C) and a marked increase in cell death (Fig.1 D). It has been demonstrated that that As2O3 at concentrations above 0.5 μm induces apoptosis in APL cells (10Chen G.Q. Zhu J. Shi X.G. Ni J.H. Zhong H.J. Si G.Y. Jin X.L. Tang W. Li X.S. Xong S.M. Shen Z.X. Sun G.L. Ma J. Zhang P. Zhang T.D. Gazin C. Naoe T. Chen S.J. Wang Z.Y. Chen Z. Blood. 1996; 88: 1052-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, we also observed a substantial increase in caspase-3 activity in cells treated with 0.8 and 1.6 μmAs2O3 but not in cells treated with lower doses of As2O3 (0.2 and 0.4 μm). The increase was detected by both Western blotting using an antibody specific for the active/cleaved caspase-3 (Fig.2 A) and fluorometric assays (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, a significant increase in caspase-2 activity was detected by fluorometric assays in cells treated with 0.8 and 1.6 μm As2O3 but not in cells treated with lower doses (0.2 and 0.4 μm) (Fig.2 C). The substantial increases in caspase-2 and caspase-3 activity in cells treated with 0.8 and 1.6 μmAs2O3 were reflected in a significant increase in trypan blue-positive cells (Fig. 2 D). It has been reported that in patients receiving daily intravenous As2O3 infusion, the plasma As2O3 concentration stays within a range between 0.5 and 3 μm for the most time with a peak level between 4.2 and 6.7 μm shortly after infusion (10Chen G.Q.

Blood. 1996; 88: 1052-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this report, we chose a highly effective and clinically relevant dose of 1.6 μm for most of the subsequent analyses.Figure 2Dose response of caspase activation and apoptosis induced by As2O3.

Total RNA was isolated from either untreated or As2O3-treated cells, and radiolabeled reverse transcripts were used to hybridize cDNA arrays containing 1,176 human gene transcripts closely related to a variety of cancers (Atlas Human Cancer Arrays, Clontech). As2O3 consistently caused a ≥2-fold change in the expression of 25 genes on the DNA array, representing ∼2% of genes analyzed. Among the most interesting genes up-regulated by As2O3 was CASPASE-10 (Fig.3 A), which has been shown to play an important role in apoptosis (26Wang J. Chun H.J. Wong W. Spencer D.M. Lenardo M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13884-13888Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 27Wang J. Zheng L. Lobito A. Chan F.K. Dale J. Sneller M. Yao X. Puck J.M. Straus S.E. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 1999; 98: 47-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). To further characterize the effect of As2O3 onCASPASE-10 expression, Northern blot analysis was performed. Consistent with the cDNA array results, CASPASE-10mRNA levels increased markedly with the As2O3 treatment, reaching its highest expression (∼7-fold) after 12 h of treatment and gradually declining thereafter (Fig. 3 B). The effect of As2O3 on caspase-10 activity was examined using fluorometric assays. As2O3treatment resulted in a time-dependent increase in caspase-10 activity, which peaked between 48 and 72 h after the addition of As2O3 to the medium, and decreased abruptly thereafter, possibly because of protein degradation during the late stages of apoptosis (Fig.4 A). The activation of caspase-10 by As2O3 was dose-dependent. Significant activation of caspase-10 only occurred in cells treated with 0.8 and 1.6 μmAs2O3 (Fig. 4 B). Importantly, treatment with the caspase-10 inhibitor Z-AEVD-FMK led to a significant reduction of the apoptosis triggered by As2O3as indicated by the considerable decrease in cell death (Fig.4C). These observations demonstrate the important role of caspase-10 in As2O3-mediated cytotoxicity. To further address the role of caspase-10 in the apoptosis cascade, the effect of the selective caspase-10 inhibitor Z-AEVD-FMK on caspase-3 activation was examined (Fig. 5). In cells treated with As2O3, an ∼20-fold increase in caspase-3 activity was detected after 48 h using fluorometric assay. Importantly, the caspase-10 inhibitor Z-AEVD-FMK at a very low concentration of 2 μm substantially attenuated the As2O3-induced caspase-3 activation, decreasing caspase-3 activity by 75% at the 48-h time point (Fig.5 A). The partial inhibition of caspase-3 by Z-AEVD-FMK was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes the active/cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 5 B). It is worth noting that although higher concentrations of Z-AEVD-FMK further decreased caspase-3 activity, even at a high concentration of 50 μm, the caspase-10 inhibitor was unable to completely abolish the As2O3-induced caspase-3 activation (Fig. 5 C). Likewise, the high concentrations of Z-AEVD-FMK (50 μm) only partially blocked the apoptotic process triggered by As2O3 (Fig. 5 D). These observations suggest that in addition to caspase-10, other early caspase(s) may also contribute to the activation of caspase-3 by As2O3. Indeed, a cleaved form of caspase-8 was detected by Western blotting in cells treated with As2O3 (Fig. 5 B), confirming the earlier report by Kitamura et al. (18Kitamura K. Minami Y. Yamamoto K. Akao Y. Kiyoi H. Saito H. Naoe T. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that caspase-8 is rapidly activated in response to As2O3treatment and plays a significant role in As2O3-induced apoptosis. We have previously shown that arsenite-stimulated MAPK phosphatase-1 induction is associated with an increase of phosphoacetyl-histone H3 on its chromatin (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To assess whether similar chromatin changes were implicated in the As2O3-mediated induction of apoptosis, we examined histone H3 modification in NB4 cells treated with different doses of As2O3 using antibodies specific for various modified histone H3 molecules (Fig.6 A). As shown in Fig.5 A, lower doses of As2O3 (0.2 and 0.4 μm) did not significantly alter the level of either phospho-histone H3 (p-Ser-10) or phosphoacetyl-histone H3 (p-Ser-10/Ac-Lys-14). However, at higher doses (0.8 and 1.6 μm), As2O3 induced a significant increase in both the phospho-histone H3 (p-Ser10) and phosphoacetyl-histone H3 (p-Ser10/Ac-Lys14) levels. The effect of As2O3 on histone H3 phosphoacetylation did not appear to be caused by a nonspecific inhibition of the histone deacetylase activity, because As2O3 treatment did not result in a significant increase in either Lys-14-acetylated histone H3 or hyperacetylated histone H3 (Ac-Lys-9/Ac-Lys-14) (Fig.6 A). Histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser-10 and dual modification (phosphorylation at Ser-10 and acetylation at Lys-14) occurred with similar kinetics in As2O3-treated cells (Fig. 6 B), supporting the notion that acetylation at the Lys-14 residue and phosphorylation at the Ser-10 residue are coupled events (19Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Comparable loading of the crude histone proteins among the various samples was verified by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody recognizing total histone H3. To examine whether histone H3 modification occurs in vivo at the chromatins of CASPASE-10, ChIP assays were performed using an antibody specifically against dually modified histone H3 (23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To ascertain that equal amounts of starting chromatin material were used, DNA amplifications were carried out by real-time PCR using input chromatin DNA (not subject to immunoprecipitation) from both untreated and As2O3-treated cells and a pair of primers specific for CASPASE-10 (Fig.7 A, left panel). The very similar CASPASE-10 amplification curves andC T values, which represent the number of PCR cycles required to reach a threshold set arbitrarily at 0.5, from both the untreated and As2O3-treated input DNA indicated that the starting chromatin materials used in the subsequent ChIP assays were comparable. To detect histone H3 phosphoacetylation, chromatin solutions were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing phosphoacetyl-histone H3 (phospho-Ser-10/Ac-Lys-14) and protein A. Genomic DNA present in the immunoprecipitates was extracted and analyzed by real-time PCR using primers specific for CASPASE-10 (Fig. 7 A,right panel). A substantial enhancement in histone H3 phosphoacetylation at the CASPASE-10 gene was detected after As2O3 treatment. The C Tvalue was reduced from 32.6 (untreated) to 28.7 (As2O3-treated), corresponding to a 15-fold increase in chromatin-bound phosphoacetyl-histone H3. The specificity of the PCR reaction was indicated by the presence of a single band of the anticipated size on agarose gel after separating the final PCR products (Fig. 7 B, upper panel). To test the specificity of the immunoprecipitation assay procedures, mock ChIP assays were carried out using rabbit pre-immune serum. TheCASPASE-10 sequence was virtually undetectable in the mock immunoprecipitates (Fig. 7 B, upper panel). Importantly, As2O3 appeared to stimulate histone H3 phosphoacetylation only at the chromatin of a small subset of genes 2J. Li and Y. Liu, unpublished observations. includingCASPASE-10 (Fig. 7). Phosphoacetyl-histone H3 was absent at the transcriptionally inactive β-GLOBIN chromatin in both untreated and As2O3-treated cells (Fig.7 B, lower panel), further illustrating the specificity of such modification in As2O3-stimulated cells. As2O3 has been shown to constitute effective therapy for APL patients relapsing from or refractory to ATRA treatment (10Chen G.Q. Zhu J. Shi X.G. Ni J.H. Zhong H.J. Si G.Y. Jin X.L. Tang W. Li X.S.

As2O3 and ATRA appear to exert their anti-leukemic effects through partially overlapping mechanisms including those leading to the restoration of granulocyte differentiation (6Degos L. Wang Z.Y.

For example, As2O3 can induce complete remission in t(15,17)-positive APL patients, regardless of their sensitivity to ATRA. In addition, As2O3can induce a high rate of molecular conversion from positive to negative for t(15,17) translocation. This is indicative of the elimination of the neoplastic progenitors that is unusual after treatment with ATRA alone (10Chen G.Q. Zhu J. Shi X.G. Ni J.H. Zhong H.J. Si G.Y. Jin X.L. Tang W. Li X.S.

Haematologica. 1999; 84: 75-77PubMed Google Scholar) have provided considerable support for the notion that the anti-leukemic effect of As2O3 lies primarily in its ability to induce apoptosis. Both in vivo and in vitro, As2O3 has been found to induce apoptosis of APL cells at clinically achievable concentrations (10Chen G.Q. Zhu J. Shi X.G. Ni J.H. Zhong H.J. Si G.Y. Jin X.L. Tang W. Li X.S. Xong S.M. Shen Z.X. Sun G.L. Ma J. Zhang P. Zhang T.D. Gazin C. Naoe T. Chen S.J. Wang Z.Y. Chen Z. Blood. 1996; 88: 1052-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen Z. Chen G.Q. Shen Z.X.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7146-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Here, we have confirmed that As2O3-induced apoptosis is associated with activation of the late caspases including caspases-2 and -3 (Figs. 1,2, and 5). Through the use of large-scale gene expression analysis, we have shown that As2O3 treatment of NB4 cells rapidly induced the expression of caspase-10 (Fig. 3). The marked As2O3-triggered elevation in caspase-10 activity (Fig. 4) appeared to be critical for the activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 5). This is evidenced by the observation that the caspase-10-selective inhibitor Z-AEVD-FMK at a very low concentration (2 μm) markedly attenuated As2O3-induced caspase-3 activation. Nevertheless, it is important to note that caspase-10 is probably only partially responsible for executing As2O3-induced apoptosis, because Z-AEVD-FMK even at a high concentration of 50 μm only partially inhibited the apoptotic process (Figs. 4 B and5 D). This observation is consistent with our results that Z-AEVD-FMK did not totally abolish caspase-3 activation, although it significantly delayed caspase-3 activation (Fig. 5). Indeed, it has been reported that caspase-8 is activated in APL cells in response to As2O3 treatment and plays a role in As2O3-induced apoptosis (18Kitamura K. Minami Y. Yamamoto K. Akao Y. Kiyoi H. Saito H. Naoe T. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is possible that both caspase-10 and the structurally related caspase-8 contribute to the activation of caspase-3. In the presence of Z-AEVD-FMK, caspase-10 activity was inhibited, whereas caspase-8 was still active, resulting in attenuated caspase-3 activation (Fig. 5, A–C) and decreased apoptosis (Figs. 4 C and 5 D). A critical role for histone deacetylase-dependent transcriptional repression by PML-RARα has recently been established in the pathogenesis of APL (7Powell B.L. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2001; 13: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Kogan S.C. Hong S.H. Shultz D.B. Privalsky M.L. Bishop J.M. Blood. 2000; 95: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Piazza F.

Indeed, the stimulation of histone modification is emerging as a common property shared by many effective APL therapeutic regimens including ATRA and various histone deacetylase inhibitors (11Chen Z. Chen G.Q. Shen Z.X. Chen S.J. Wang Z.Y. Semin. Hematol. 2001; 38: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Warrell Jr., R.P. He L.Z. Richon V. Calleja E. Pandolfi P.P. J. Natl.

Here, we have examined the effect of As2O3 on histone H3 modification. Clinically relevant doses of As2O3 were found to potently enhance histone H3 phosphorylation and phosphoacetylation (Fig. 6), modifications that are similar to those reported to occur following treatment with mitogens and stress agents (20Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The role that histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation plays in activating gene transcription has recently been documented (20Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 34Clayton A.L. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C.

Here, we show that As2O3 strongly increases histone H3 phosphoacetylation at the CASPASE-10 chromatin (Fig. 6). Thus, enhanced histone phosphoacetylation at the CASPASE-10chromatin is likely to contribute to the observed increase inCASPASE-10 expression, caspase-10 activation, and subsequent apoptosis. As2O3 may promote apoptosis through multiple mechanisms. Caspase-10 activation is probably only part of the apoptotic execution machinery, because As2O3causes ≥2-fold change in the expression of only ∼2% of genes on the DNA array (25 genes of 1,176). In this regard, As2O3 enhances gene expression in a relatively selective manner. This finding is consistent with our observation that neither As2O3 significantly altered the levels of hyperacetylated (Ac-Lys-9/Ac-Lys-14) at the global levels (Fig. 5), nor did it induce histone H3 acetylation at the β-GLOBINlocus (Fig. 6 B). Although it is unclear how the relative specificity of As2O3 is achieved, we can speculate that it may involve the degradation of the PML-RARα and a protein kinase that can phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser-10. Interestingly, it has been shown that As2O3induces the phosphorylation of the SMRT protein, the dissociation of SMRT from its nuclear receptor partner including PML-RARα, and the transport of SMRT from the nucleus into the cytoplasm through a MAPK-mediated mechanism (36Hong S.H. Yang Z. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7172-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that As2O3-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells is partially blocked by a pharmacological inhibitor of MAPK kinase; thus, further supporting a significant role of MAPK in the process (36Hong S.H. Yang Z. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7172-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MAPK can activate two downstream kinases, MSK1 and p90Rsk2 (37Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 38Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), which are shown to directly phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser-10. It has been shown that both epidermal growth factor and stress stimulate histone H3 phosphoacetylation through a MAPK-mediated pathway (19Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 23Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, one possible mechanism that As2O3 induces apoptosis in APL cells is by promoting histone H3 phosphoacetylation and degradation of PML-RARα at the promoters of ATRA-regulated genes through a process regulated at least in part by MAPKs. Further characterization of the mechanisms involved in this process may aid in the development of more effective less toxic therapeutic regimens for APL. We thank Y. Jing and D. L. Longo for helpful discussions."

The symptoms of SBMA include the adult onset of symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations. Bulbar muscle weakness manifests as difficulty with speech and swallowing (4Kennedy W.R. Alter M. Sung J.H. Neurology. 1968; 18: 671-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the AR gene from 10–36 in normal individuals to 40–62 in patients (6La Spada A.R. Wilson E.M. Lubahn D.B. Harding A.E. Fischbeck K.H. Nature. 1991; 353: 77-79Crossref Scopus (2380) Google Scholar) leads to expression of an expanded polyglutamine tract in the AR protein, causing SBMA.SBMA is characterized by the loss of motor and sensory neurons (7Sobue G.

Whether the development of inclusions represents one of the toxic properties of expanded polyglutamines is unclear. Inclusion formation was not associated with toxicity in several model systems (15Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D., Yi, H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T.

Although NII may be neither necessary nor sufficient for neuronal dysfunction and death, their presence signals the inefficient clearance of the mutant protein.Previous models of SBMA have revealed the formation of NII and the sequestration of a variety of proteins involved in protein degradation and AR transcriptional function. Transiently transfected HeLa cells expressing full-length expanded AR treated with ligand show an accumulation of AR into cytoplasmic aggregates (with rare NII) that contain Hsp70, Hsp90, NEDD8 (a ubiquitin-like protein), PA700 (26 S proteasome cap), SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator 1), and mitochondria (18Stenoien D.L.

In addition, histological studies of mice expressing a truncated, highly expanded form of AR revealed intranuclear inclusions positive for ubiquitin, the molecular chaperones Hdj2 and Hsc70, components of the 26 S proteasome, and CBP (CREB-binding protein) (19Abel A.

Therefore, we created an inducible PC12 cell model of SBMA in which full-length highly expanded AR112 is expressed under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter.

These inclusions contained only amino-terminal epitopes of AR. Ubiquitin and the molecular chaperone Hsc70 co-localized with AR in these NII, consistent with the mutant protein being targeted for degradation.

Neurol. 1998; 44: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe creation of cellular and animal models that reproduce symptoms of SBMA is critical for understanding the molecular and cellular pathways that mediate disease pathogenesis. Cell models of SBMA that replicate the altered mutant AR metabolism and NII formation observed in patients have been difficult to develop. Previous cell models of SBMA created by transient transfection of full-length expanded AR have produced predominantly cytoplasmic aggregates containing the entire AR protein (17Simeoni S. Mancini M.A. Stenoien D.L. Marcelli M. Weigel N.L. Zanisi M. Martini L. Poletti A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Stenoien D.L. Cummings C.J. Adams H.P. Mancini M.G. Patel K. DeMartino G.N. Marcelli M. Weigel N.L. Mancini M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 25Butler R. Leigh P.N. McPhaul M.J. Gallo J.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Becker M. Elke M. Schneikert J. Krug H.F. Cato A.C.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These models have revealed a role for ligand binding in promoting an altered conformation of the mutant AR leading to aggregate formation, but they did not reproduce the nuclear inclusions found in patients with SBMA.We have developed a cell model in which cells expressing AR112 form AR-containing, ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions. These NII are detected exclusively with antibodies to amino-terminal epitopes of the AR protein, as are the inclusions observed in patient tissue (8Li M. Miwa S. Kobayashi Y. Merry D.E. Yamamoto M. Tanaka F. Doyu M. Hashizume Y. Fischbeck K.H. Sobue G. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Ligand treatment leads to increased NII formation, consistent with a role for nuclear localization, altered conformation, and aberrant proteolysis in the development of AR NII.The expression of high levels of mutant AR protein in inducible PC12 clones resulted in nuclear inclusion formation, whereas expression of protein by cells transiently transfected with mutant AR has failed to reproduce this aspect of pathology. This phenomenon may be related to the temporal expression of mutant protein in a stable inducible cell line versus a transient transfection system. It may also be specific to PC12 cells. The type of cell used for transient transfection experiments with a truncated expanded AR altered the location of inclusions within the cell (26Merry D.E. Kobayashi Y. Bailey C.K. Taye A.A. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Expression of truncated expanded AR in COS-7 cells produced cytoplasmic aggregates, whereas the same construct expressed in MN-1 cells produced NII. Furthermore, studies have shown that the context of proteins in a particular cell line can alter where expanded full-length AR forms aggregates, whether in the cytoplasm or nucleus (31Welch W.J. Diamond M.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 10: 3063-3074Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that mutant AR adopts an altered conformation that results in protein associations unique to PC12 cells leading to the formation of NII. PC12 cells might thus exhibit properties in common with motor neurons that reproduce the environment necessary for the formation of NII in SBMA.The neuronal inclusions found in SBMA patient tissue are detected exclusively by antibodies to amino-terminal epitopes (8Li M. Miwa S. Kobayashi Y. Merry D.E. Yamamoto M. Tanaka F. Doyu M. Hashizume Y. Fischbeck K.H. Sobue G. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The inclusions shown here in AR112-expressing PC12 cells mimic this specific aspect of SBMA pathology. AR112-containing NII are also ubiquitinated, as seen in patient tissue. Whereas previous cellular and transgenic models of SBMA have revealed Hsp70, Hsc70, Hdj2, Hsp90, components of the 26 S proteasome, SRC-1, and CBP within AR-containing aggregates (18Stenoien D.L. Cummings C.J. Adams H.P. Mancini M.G. Patel K. DeMartino G.N. Marcelli M. Weigel N.L. Mancini M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 19Abel A. Walcott J. Woods J. Duda J. Merry D.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the NII in AR112-expressing PC12 cells contain only Hsc70. These cells may require longer periods of treatment than our growing conditions would allow for certain proteins to accumulate in the inclusions. In addition, there may be other unknown proteins necessary for neuronal survival and function sequestered in these NII that we have yet to identify.The presence of amino-terminal epitopes in NII suggests that AR112 is proteolytically processed prior to or during aggregate formation. This may be a common pathogenic mechanism in many polyglutamine diseases, because amino-terminal epitopes of expanded polyglutamine protein have been detected in patient tissue in Huntington's disease (10DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (32Schilling G.

Biochemical evidence for such polyglutamine-containing fragments has been demonstrated for Huntington's disease (10DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N.

Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Whereas we have been unable to identify a protein fragment that is enriched in the nuclear fraction using biochemical approaches, immunofluorescence studies indicate that AR112 is indeed processed to form a fragment that aggregates in the nucleus in this cell system.The formation of NII in AR112-expressing PC12 cells was not entirely ligand-dependent, as these structures were observed at low frequency in the absence of dihydrotestosterone in charcoal-stripped serum (Fig. 2 C). The formation of NII in the absence of administered ligand may result from low levels of nuclear AR being present, even in the absence of exogenous ligand (data not shown), or from the incomplete removal of hormones from the charcoal-stripped serum. Nonetheless, administration of DHT substantially enhanced NII formation as did the antagonist flutamide. Treatment with the antagonist flutamide resulted in the nuclear translocation of AR112 and led to the formation of NII at a similar frequency (data not shown). These results suggest that the localization of the AR to the nucleus is critical to NII formation. Moreover, these findings suggest that hormone levels are critical for the development of this pathologic feature of SBMA and provide a molecular explanation for the lack of symptoms in female carriers of the disease. Indeed, females are protected by the inactivation of the mutant AR in approximately half of their cells; our data indicate that they are also protected by low levels of circulating androgens.DHT treatment of AR112-expressing cells resulted in progressive cell death. However, a similar loss of cell survival was seen in AR10-expressing cells. Differentiation was found to make these cells more susceptible to AR-mediated toxicity, as AR-mediated cell death was not seen in undifferentiated cells under the same conditions (data not shown). AR has been shown to play a trophic role for laryngeal motor neurons after axotomy (35Perez J. Kelley D.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6625-6633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its effects on androgen-responsive tissue indicate that it acts at a physiological level in a trophic manner (36Kurz E.M. Sengelaub D.R. Arnold A.P. Science. 1986; 232: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 37Kujawa K.A. Emeric E. Jones K.J. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3898-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Yu W.A. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3908-3914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, AR-mediated toxicity may result from conflicting signals within the cell for growth and cell differentiation mediated by AR expression and nerve growth factor administration, respectively. Whereas repeat length-dependent toxicity may exist, it was not detected under these conditions. The formation of NII has not been associated with toxicity in other cellular models (16Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar,17Simeoni S. Mancini M.A. Stenoien D.L. Marcelli M. Weigel N.L. Zanisi M. Martini L. Poletti A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in mouse models of SBMA (19Abel A. Walcott J. Woods J. Duda J. Merry D.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) severe neurological dysfunction was found in the absence of detectable neuronal loss, suggesting that cell death may be a late event in the progression of disease pathology.We have developed a model that reproduces several characteristics of SBMA pathology previously lacking in other cellular models, and we have demonstrated a role for ligand in the development of cellular pathology. This model will prove invaluable for biochemical studies of altered mutant AR metabolism and proteolysis and of cellular dysfunction resulting from the expression and abnormal accumulation of the mutant AR protein. X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is a progressive neuromuscular disorder that is one of a group of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease, Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and several spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, -2, -3, -6, -7, -17),1 all caused by expansion of a polyglutamine repeat (Ref. 1Nakamura K. Jeong S.-Y. Uchihara T. Anno M. Nagashima K. Nagashima T. Ikeda S.-I. Kanazawa I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, reviewed by Refs. 2Cummings C.

The symptoms of SBMA include the adult onset of symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations. Bulbar muscle weakness manifests as difficulty with speech and swallowing (4Kennedy W.R. Alter M. Sung J.H. Neurology. 1968; 18: 671-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Affected males often show signs of partial androgen insensitivity such as gynecomastia, reduced fertility, and testicular atrophy despite normal or increased serum testosterone levels (5Arbizu T. Santamaria J. Gomez J.M. Quilez A. Serra J.P. J. Neurol. Sci. 1983; 59: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the AR gene from 10–36 in normal individuals to 40–62 in patients (6La Spada A.R. Wilson E.M. Lubahn D.B. Harding A.E. Fischbeck K.H. Nature. 1991; 353: 77-79Crossref Scopus (2380) Google Scholar) leads to expression of an expanded polyglutamine tract in the AR protein, causing SBMA. SBMA is characterized by the loss of motor and sensory neurons (7Sobue G. Hashizume Y. Mukai E. Hirayama M. Mitsuma T. Takahashi A. Brain. 1989; 112: 209-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and by the finding of AR-containing ubiquitinated neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) in spinal motor neurons (8Li M. Miwa S.

Ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions also appear in affected neurons in Huntington's disease, SCA3 (Machado- Joseph disease), SCA7, SCA17, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (1Nakamura K.

Cell culture and transgenic mouse studies of SBMA and other polyglutamine diseases indicate that these diseases result from toxic properties of the mutant expanded polyglutamine protein, part or all of which accumulates in NII caused in part by its reduced turnover (14Bailey C.K. Andriola I.F.M. Kampinga H.H. Merry D.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Whether the development of inclusions represents one of the toxic properties of expanded polyglutamines is unclear. Inclusion formation was not associated with toxicity in several model systems (15Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D., Yi, H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T.

Although NII may be neither necessary nor sufficient for neuronal dysfunction and death, their presence signals the inefficient clearance of the mutant protein. Previous models of SBMA have revealed the formation of NII and the sequestration of a variety of proteins involved in protein degradation and AR transcriptional function. Transiently transfected HeLa cells expressing full-length expanded AR treated with ligand show an accumulation of AR into cytoplasmic aggregates (with rare NII) that contain Hsp70, Hsp90, NEDD8 (a ubiquitin-like protein), PA700 (26 S proteasome cap), SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator 1), and mitochondria (18Stenoien D.L.

In addition, histological studies of mice expressing a truncated, highly expanded form of AR revealed intranuclear inclusions positive for ubiquitin, the molecular chaperones Hdj2 and Hsc70, components of the 26 S proteasome, and CBP (CREB-binding protein) (19Abel A.

Real-time RT-PCR analyses of expression levels in a panel of 34 paired primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and corresponding grossly normal appearing lung tissues confirmed the common overexpression of these genes in non-small cell lung cancer. Among these genes, overexpression of Lc19, hyaluronan binding protein 2 (HABP2) and crystalline-mu appeared more specific to adenocarcinoma, whereas ceruloplasmin, integrin alpha-11 and collagen type XI alpha 1 were overexpressed at high frequency among both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

Med. 1991; 324: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the mechanisms of ganglioside trophic activity are still unclear. Potential substrates of GM1 that would explain its neurotrophic effects are the neurotrophins and their receptors. The neurotrophin family of neurotrophic factors includes nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin (NT)-3, NT-4/5, and NT-6 (reviewed in Ref. 19Reichardt L.F. Mocchetti I. Neurobiology of the Neurotrophins. F. P. Graham Publishing Co., Johnson City, TN2001: 3-28Google Scholar). These trophic factors can promote the survival, growth, and differentiation of neurons through activation of the Trk transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (20Kaplan D. Marin-Zanca D. Parada L.

NGF binds to TrkA; BDNF and NT-4/5 activate TrkB; and NT-3 primarily activates TrkC, but can also bind to TrkA and TrkB (reviewed in Ref. 24Bothwell M. Mocchetti I. Neurobiology of the Neurotrophins. F. P. Graham Publishing Co., Johnson City, TN2001: 29-46Google Scholar). p75 binds all members with relative equal affinity (25Chao M.V. Hempstead B. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 321-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have demonstrated that GM1 is able to activate the TrkA receptor (26Ferrari G. Anderson B. Stephens B. Kaplan D. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3074-3080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Mutoh T. Tokuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M.

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that GM1 may mimic NGF trophic activity. However, although the TrkA activation can justify the neurotrophic effects of GM1 on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, it does not explain the effect of GM1 on other neuronal populations unresponsive to NGF. On the other hand, LIGA20, a semisynthetic derivative of GM1 (15Manev H. Favaron M. Vicini S. Guidotti A. Costa E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 419-427PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kharlamov A.

Mocchetti I. Neurotoxicity Res. 2002; 4: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that gangliosides activate various neurotrophin receptors. In addition, we have examined the molecular mechanism whereby GM1 and LIGA20 may activate Trk by determining whether these gangliosides act as ligands for the Trk receptors or induce the release of the neurotrophins. We provide evidence that GM1 induces the release of NT-3, whereas LIGA20 mediates the release of BDNF. NIH-3T3 cells expressing each Trk receptor (kindly provided by Dr. D. Kaplan, Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, Canada) were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (Invitrogen) and 200 μg/ml Geneticin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. The medium was changed every 3 days, and confluent cells were used for the experiments. Incubation of cells with control medium (0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)), growth factors, and other compounds was carried out in serum-free medium. Cerebellar granule cells were prepared from postnatal day 8 Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Taconic Farms Inc., Germantown, NY) as previously described (31Brandoli C. Sanna A. De Bernardi M.A. Follesa P. Brooker G. Mocchetti I. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7953-7961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bachis A. Colangelo A.M. Vicini S. Doe P.P. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mocchetti I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3104-3112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, neurons were plated onto 1% poly-l-lysine-precoated 100-mm plastic dishes at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml and grown in basal Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing glutamine (2 mm), fetal calf serum (10%), KCl (25 mm), gentamycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units/ml). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added 24 h after cell plating to inhibit non-neuronal cell proliferation. Cultures were used on day 8 in vitro for all experiments. Trk tyrosine phosphorylation was carried out as described (28Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were exposed to neurotrophins (Promega, Madison, WI), gangliosides (Fidia S.p.A., Abano Terme, Italy), or Trk-IgG receptor bodies (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Terrytown, NY) for the appropriate time points and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) (Sigma) at 4 °C. After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation, protein levels in the lysates were measured by the Bradford Coomassie Blue colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad) and equalized accordingly. The lysates were incubated with an anti-Trk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), followed by protein A-Sepharose precipitation (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h as previously described (28Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitate was then washed and resuspended in 10 μl of sample buffer (2% SDS, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.25% bromphenol blue) for electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) as previously described (28Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were analyzed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (AmershamBiosciences) and then stripped and reprobed with anti-pan Trk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell membranes for receptor binding were prepared according to the method of Hempstead et al. (33Hempstead B. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D. Parada L. Chao M. Nature. 1991; 350: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were harvested in a buffer solution containing 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA and lysed using a Tekmar Tissumizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, and membranes were isolated by centrifugation of the supernatant for 30 min at 15,000 × g. The membrane pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and stored at −70 °C. Binding studies were performed using 30 μg of protein suspended in a binding solution of culture medium containing 5 mg/ml BSA and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). 125I-Labeled NT-3 and 125I-labeled NGF (Bachem, San Carlos, CA) were labeled to specific activities of 2120 and 2200 Ci/mmol, respectively, according to an established method (34Marchalonis J. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled neurotrophins were added to the mixture (0.21-ml final volume), followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. The bound complexes were isolated by filtration through GF/C filters and washed using the binding solution; the filters were then counted using a γ-counter with a counting efficiency of 80%. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 200-fold excess of unlabeled neurotrophins in the binding solution. Saturation and Scatchard analyses were performed using the LIGAND program. Transient transfection of NIH-3T3 cells with the pCDM8 expression vector (Invitrogen) was carried out as previously described (35Colangelo A.M. Johnson P.F. Mocchetti I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10920-10925Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Transfection included 8 μg of pCDM8 or pCDM8 containing a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and the intracellular domain of TrkA (36Rovelli G. Heller R.A. Canossa M. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8717-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. Eric M. Shooter (Stanford University, Stanford CA), and 0.2 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase reporter vector as an internal control. After 6 h, cells were washed twice and incubated with growth medium. Cells were allowed to express this receptor for 2 days before harvesting. After exposure to GM1, NGF, or TNF for 5 min, cells were lysed as described above. The lysates were incubated with an anti-Trk antibody, and Trk tyrosine phosphorylation was determined as described above. Neurotrophin levels were determined by a two-site immunoassay as previously described (37Marini A. Rabin S. Lipsky R. Mocchetti I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29394-29399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 38Rabin S. Tornatore C. Baker-Cairns B. Spiga G. Mocchetti I. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were allowed to reach 85% confluence; the medium was then changed and replaced with unconditioned serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA or gangliosides. Incubation was allowed to proceed for 5, 15, or 30 min or additional times. The medium was then removed and concentrated using Centricon YM-10 concentrators (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and neurotrophin levels were determined using the NGF/NT-3/BDNF EmaxTM immunoassay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cerebellar granule cell survival was determined by mitochondrial dehydrogenases 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as previously described (30Bachis A. Rabin S.J. Del Fiacco M. Mocchetti I. Neurotoxicity Res. 2002; 4: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Bachis A. Colangelo A.M. Vicini S. Doe P.P. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mocchetti I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3104-3112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and according to the manufacturer's specifications (MTT Kit I, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, neurons were cultured on 96-well plates; 10 μl of the 5 mg/ml MTT labeling reagent was added to each well containing neurons; and plates were incubated for 4 h in a humidified atmosphere. After the incubation, 100 μl of the solubilization solution was added to each well for 18 h. The absorbance of the samples was measured at wavelengths of 570 and 700 nm. GM1 activates TrkA (28Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) more than TrkB (30Bachis A. Rabin S.J. Del Fiacco M. Mocchetti I. Neurotoxicity Res. 2002; 4: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting that this ganglioside may affect different Trk receptors. To examine the relative potency of GM1 in Trk activation, we used NIH-3T3 fibroblasts transfected with cDNAs for TrkA (NIHA), TrkB (NIHB), or TrkC (NIHC). Cells were exposed to GM1 (60 μm), and Trk tyrosine phosphorylation was determined at various time points. Cells were also exposed to NGF, BDNF, or NT-3 (100 ng/ml each) as a positive control and to ceramide, the lipophilic portion of GM1. In NIHA (Fig.1 A) and NIHC (Fig.1 C) cells, GM1 increased TrkA and TrkC tyrosine phosphorylation, respectively, within 10 min, although its potency was weaker than that of NGF or NT-3. The effect of GM1 on Trk tyrosine phosphorylation lasted up to 30 min and was over by 3 h (Fig.2 A). Surprisingly, exposure of NIHB cells to GM1 for 10, 30, or 180 min did not result in any significant increase in TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation (Figs.1 B and 2 A). Therefore, the GM1-mediated increase in TrkC tyrosine phosphorylation was quantitatively stronger than that of other Trk receptors (Fig. 2 A). Ceramide failed to change the basal levels of Trk tyrosine phosphorylation in any cell line examined (Fig. 1).Figure 2Gangliosides differentially activate Trk receptors. NIHA, NIHB, and NIHC cells were exposed to 60 μm GM1 (A) or 5 μm LIGA20 (B) for the indicated times. Cells were then lysed, and Trk tyrosine phosphorylation was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The Trk band on the autoradiograph was scanned with a laser densitometer for semiquantitative analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation (28Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Cells were then exposed to LIGA20, which we have previously shown to activate TrkB in cerebellar granule cells more potently than GM1 (30Bachis A. Rabin S.J. Del Fiacco M. Mocchetti I. Neurotoxicity Res. 2002; 4: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast to GM1, LIGA20 elicited a significant increase in TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation within 10 min (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the weaker effect of GM1 on TrkB is not attributable to lower expression of these receptors or to unresponsiveness of NIHB cells to gangliosides. The relative potency of GM1 in activating TrkC more than other Trk receptors could be due to a quantitatively different number of Trk receptors expressed in NIH-3T3 cells. To test this hypothesis, equilibrium binding and Scatchard plot analyses were carried out. Crude membranes were prepared from NIHC and NIHA cells and assayed for binding to125I-labeled NT-3 or 125I-labeled NGF, respectively. In NIHC cells, a specific and saturable NT-3 binding was observed with one site in the high affinity range (K D = 9 ± 1.1 pm) (Fig.3 A). Similarly, NIHA cells exhibited a saturable and high affinity binding site for NGF (K D = 12 ± 2.5 pm) (data not shown). The single binding site in both cell lines most likely results from the fact that these cells do not express the low affinity component of the neurotrophin receptor p75 (21Cordon-Cardo C. Tapley P. Jing S. Nanduri V. O'Rouke E. Lamballe F. Kovary K. Klein R. Jones K.R. Reichardt L.F. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 55: 173-183Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Moreover, both cell lines expressed a comparable amount of receptors (NIHC,B max = 700 ± 88 fmol/mg of protein; and NIHA, Bmax = 778 ± 79 fmol/mg of protein). Therefore, the stronger activation of TrkC versus TrkA by GM1 is not the result of differential expression of Trk receptors in these cells. GM1 may act as a ligand for TrkC. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of GM1 to displace 125I-labeled NT-3. Unlabeled NT-3 and NGF were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. NT-3 was able to elicit a concentration-dependent decrease in 125I-labeled NT-3 binding starting at 10 pm(Fig. 3 B). In contrast, neither GM1 nor NGF displaced125I-labeled NT-3 binding even when used at 10 μm (Fig. 3 B). These data indicate that GM1 does not interact with TrkC at the NT-3-binding site. However, GM1 may interact at an allosteric site of the TrkC receptors. Thus, we examined whether GM1 changes the affinity of NT-3 for its receptor. The binding assay was performed with membranes incubated with125I-labeled NT-3 (10 pm) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of GM1 (up to 100 μm) (data not shown), and binding data were analyzed by Scatchard plot. GM1 failed to significantly change the affinity of 125I-labeled NT-3 for TrkC (NT-3, K D = 10 ± 1.9 pm; and NT-3 + GM1, K D = 11 ± 1.5 pm), suggesting that GM1 does not act at an allosteric site of the TrkC receptor. Activation of Trk tyrosine phosphorylation can occur in the absence of NGF (39Lee F.S. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 898: 3555-3560Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been postulated that GM1 may activate TrkA by inducing receptor dimerization (40Farooqui T. Franklin D. Pearl D. Yates A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2348-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To test whether either one of these mechanisms may account for the ability of GM1 to induce Trk tyrosine phosphorylation, NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with an expression vector containing p70trk, a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of the TNF receptor and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of TrkA (36Rovelli G. Heller R.A. Canossa M. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8717-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). p70trk has been shown to induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells in response to TNF, similar to NGF (36Rovelli G. Heller R.A. Canossa M. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8717-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were then exposed to GM1 (60 μm) or NGF or TNF (100 ng/ml each) for 10 min. TNF promoted a strong autophosphorylation of p70trk(Fig. 4). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a (100 nm) reduced this activation. In contrast, neither GM1 nor NGF increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of p70trk (Fig. 4), suggesting that the activation of Trk tyrosine phosphorylation by GM1 requires the extracellular portion of Trk. Neurotrophins may activate Trk receptors by autocrine and paracrine loops. Thus, gangliosides may facilitate the release of neurotrophins, which, in turn, activate various Trk receptors (41Benedetti M. Levi A. Chao M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7859-7863Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 42Clary D.O. Reichardt L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pozniak C. Rusakov D. Kaplan D. Miller F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To establish whether this mechanism accounts for the ability of GM1 to induce Trk autophosphorylation, we measured neurotrophin levels in the medium of each transfected NIH-3T3 cell line by a two-site immunoassay. Fig.5 shows that GM1 treatment elicited a significant increase in the amount of NT-3 released from NIHC and NIHA cells. GM1 was more potent in NIHC cells than in NIHA cells. By 30 min, the effect of GM1, although higher than that of the control, was not statistically significant (data not shown). In NIHA and NIHB cells, GM1 failed to induce a significant increase in NGF or BDNF levels (Fig. 5). Therefore, GM1 appears to promote mainly the release of NT-3. To examine whether the facilitation of NT-3 release by GM1 requires Trk, NT-3 accumulation was measured in the media of wild-type NIH-3T3 and NIHC cells exposed for 10 min to GM1 alone or in combination with K252a. GM1 increased NT-3 release in both cell lines, and its effect was not blocked by K252a (Table I). Thus, GM1 has a similar pharmacological profile regardless of the presence of Trk, suggesting that the induction of NT-3 release by GM1 does not depend upon Trk activation.Table IK252a does not inhibit the GM1-mediated release of NT-3 from NIHC cellsTreatmentNT-3NIH-3T3NIHCpg/mg proteinControl8.5 ± 1.78.2 ± 4.2GM122.1 ± 4.71-ap < 0.001 versus control (analysis of variance and Dunnett's test).16.7 ± 2.81-ap < 0.001 versus control (analysis of variance and Dunnett's test).K252a7.8 ± 2.09.1 ± 3.3GM1 + K252a21.2 ± 3.21-ap < 0.001 versus control (analysis of variance and Dunnett's test).17.1 ± 2.71-ap < 0.001 versus control (analysis of variance and Dunnett's test).NIHC cells were exposed for 10 min to GM1 (60 μm) or K252a (100 nm) alone or to K252a 10 min prior to GM1 and incubated for an additional 10 min.

The activity of endogenous neurotrophins can be neutralized by Trk-IgG “receptor bodies,” generated by fusion of the Trk extracellular binding domain to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin (46Acheson A.

To further examine whether GM1-mediated activation of Trk receptors correlates with an NT-3 autocrine signal, NIHC cells were preincubated with TrkC-IgG prior to exposure to neurotrophins or gangliosides. TrkB-IgG was used as negative control, as this reagent does not affect the activity of NT-3. Pretreatment of NIHC with TrkC-IgG (10 μg/ml) for 20 min reduced the ability of NT-3 and GM1 to increase TrkC tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.6). TrkB-IgG did not prevent GM1-mediated induction of TrkC (Fig. 6). Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that the ability of GM1 to activate TrkC tyrosine phosphorylation may be due to the secretion of NT-3. GM1 activates TrkA in various cells, including rat C6 glioma cells expressing TrkA (C6Trk) (28Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Colangelo A.M.

Herein we investigate the molecular mechanism of ceramide signaling in endothelial apoptosis induced by fenretinide (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR)). 4-HPR, a synthetic derivative of retinoic acid that induces ceramide in tumor cell lines, has been shown to have antiangiogenic effects, but the molecular mechanism of these is largely unknown. We report that 4-HPR was cytotoxic to endothelial cells (50% cytotoxicity at 2.4 μm, 90% at 5.36 μm) and induced a caspase-dependent endothelial apoptosis. 4-HPR (5 μm) increased ceramide levels in endothelial cells 5.3-fold, and the increase in ceramide was required to achieve the apoptotic effect of 4-HPR.

We have recently shown that another stress response, endothelial anoikis (apoptosis resulting from the loss of matrix adhesion) is also associated with increased ceramide (5Erdreich-Epstein A.

Ceramide can be generated by hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin by acid and/or neutral sphingomyelinase and via activation of the de novoceramide synthesis pathway, both of which can promote apoptosis (1Mathias S.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 224-226PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that 4-HPR was cytotoxic to CPAE bovine artery endothelial cells, Ribatti et al. (15Ribatti D. Alessandri G. Baronio M. Raffaghello L.

These data support an antiangiogenic role for 4-HPR, yet the molecular mechanism of the effects of 4-HPR in endothelial cells remains largely unknown. To date, the cytotoxic mechanism of 4-HPR has been studied almost exclusively in tumor cell lines, where it appears to function by more than one mechanism (12Reynolds C.P. Lemons R.S. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2001; 15: 867-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Wu J.M. DiPietrantonio A.M. Hsieh T.C. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In leukemia cells, 4-HPR-mediated apoptosis was associated with decreased levels of bcl-2mRNA and was diminished by inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, by inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis, by activators of protein kinase C, and by antioxidants (16Delia D. Aiello A. Formelli F. Fontanella E. Costa A. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Pierotti M.A. Blood. 1995; 85: 359-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Delia D. Aiello A. Meroni L. Nicolini M. Reed J.C. Pierotti M.A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 4-HPR-mediated apoptosis in leukemia cells was also associated with activation of caspase-3 via a mechanism separate from induction of reactive oxygen species (18DiPietrantonio A.M. Hsieh T.C. Juan G. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Wu J.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4331-4335PubMed Google Scholar) and with increased de novo synthesis of ceramide (19O'Donnell P.H. Guo W.X. Reynolds C.P. Maurer B.J. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In neuroblastoma cells, 4-HPR induced a mixed caspase-mediated apoptosis and caspase-independent necrosis that was associated with increased reactive oxygen species and increase in intracellular ceramide viade novo synthesis (20Maurer B.J. Metelitsa L.S. Seeger R.C. Cabot M.C. Reynolds C.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Combining 4-HPR with agents that inhibit intracellular ceramide metabolism further increased ceramide levels and was associated with increased cytotoxicity, suggesting that ceramide is a mediator of 4-HPR-induced tumor cell cytotoxicity (21Maurer B.J. Melton L. Billups C. Cabot M.C. Reynolds C.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In light of the antiendothelial effects of 4-HPR, its potential for antiangiogenic activity (14Pienta K.J. Nguyen N.M. Lehr J.E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 224-226PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ribatti D.

Care Med. 2000; 28: N87-N93Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we were interested in the role of ceramide signaling in mediating the antiendothelial effect of 4-HPR. In the work reported here we demonstrate that 4-HPR induces a caspase-dependent endothelial apoptosis. We also show that 4-HPR increased endothelial cell ceramide by stimulation of de novo synthesis and thatde novo generated ceramide has a causal role in 4-HPR-mediated apoptosis of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (human BMEC). Last, we establish that ceramide functions upstream of caspases in the ordering of ceramide and caspases in endothelial cells. These results provide the first evidence for endothelial apoptosis by 4-HPR and show that activation of the ceramide pathway is required for this apoptosis, thus presenting a molecular mechanism for the antiangiogenic effects of 4-HPR. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (human BMEC (25Stins M.F. Gilles F. Kim K.S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar)) and large-T antigen-transfected bovine microvascular endothelial cells (bovine TBMEC (26Stins M.F.

Kim, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD). Two different isolates of human BMEC were used. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10% Nu-Serum™ IV Culture Supplement (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) as described (5Erdreich-Epstein A.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (ATCC CRL-1730; passages 16–20) were maintained according to the supplier's recommendations. For experiments, cells were plated and allowed to attach and spread for 4–18 h prior to beginning the experiment. In all cases, floating and attached cells in each sample were both combined for processing at the end of incubation. Both high passage (passage 56) and low passage (passage 16) human BMEC showed characteristic endothelial morphology comparable with primary human BMEC (passage 5). Factor VIII-reactive antigen (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) (25Stins M.F. Gilles F. Kim K.S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) was expressed at all passages as determined by flow cytometry, although levels decreased in the higher passages. Uptake of fluorescent 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein (BTI, Stoughton, MA) remained similar for all passages and further confirmed the endothelial phenotype (25Stins M.F. Gilles F. Kim K.S. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 76: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). High and low passage human BMEC were functionally similar, as demonstrated by equivalent expression of intercellular adhesion molecule in response to tumor necrosis factor-α (10 ng/ml) with or without interferon-γ pretreatment and in response to other stimuli (e.g. gp120 (0.5 μg/ml), bacterial exposure (Escherichia coli E44), or lipopolysaccharide (50 ng/ml)) as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (27Stins M.F. Shen Y. Huang S.H. Gilles F. Kalra V.K. Kim K.S. J. Neurovirol. 2001; 7: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, tumor necrosis factor-α- and lipopolysaccharide-induced lactate dehydrogenase release (Sigma kit) were also similar in both the high and low passage human BMEC (data not shown). Experiments were performed using both low passage (passages 12–25) and higher passage (passages 25–55) human BMEC, yielding similar results for cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and ceramide increase. 4-HPR was kindly provided by Dr. Sherry Ansher (NCI, National Institutes of Health).

Uniplate Silica gel G TLC plates were from Analtech, Inc. (Newark, DE). EN3HANCE®spray was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ecolume scintillation mixture was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Apoptosis was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed, RNase-treated cells with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 min on ice) and identifying cells with a sub-G0/G1 DNA content, indicative of apoptosis, using a Coulter Epics ELITE flow cytometer (Coulter, Miami, FL). For morphological assessment of DNA condensation and/or apoptotic bodies, cells were grown on chamber slides and then incubated with the supravital DNA stain Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C). When using fixed cells (cytospins), the dye used was Hoechst-bisbenzamide 33258 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). For analysis of apoptosis by Hoechst staining, ∼300–500 cells from a total of 5–10 fields in each sample were counted under UV filter at ×400 magnification. Cell viability was assessed by uptake of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (thiazolyl blue (MTT)) (5Erdreich-Epstein A. Shimada H. Groshen S. Liu M. Metelitsa L.S. Kim K.S.

Briefly, endothelial cells (3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were allowed to attach and spread in medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Cells were radioactively labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (1 μCi/ml, 10 ml per 10-cm dish), and 4-HPR was added either simultaneously with [3H]palmitic acid or following 6–24 h labeling, as indicated. For experiments to measure sphingomyelin, glucosylceramide, or ceramide in the absence of de novo synthesis, cells were prepared by prelabeling with [3H]palmitic acid for 24 h, washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubating them for 2 h in fresh growth medium containing 0.1% FBS and lacking isotope. After 2 h, the medium was replaced, and 4-HPR or vehicle control was added for the indicated time. At the end of incubation, adherent and detached cells were trypsinized, combined, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C). Total cellular lipids were extracted using equal volumes of methanol 2% acetic acid (v/v), water, and chloroform. After phase separation by centrifugation, the lower phase was dried under N2 and stored at −20 °C. Lipids were solubilized in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and analyzed by TLC utilizing commercial lipid standards as markers visualized in iodine vapors, as described (5Erdreich-Epstein A.

Tritium in the TLC-resolved lipid band and total tritium in equal aliquots of the extracted cellular lipids were quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of ceramide, sphingomyelin, or glucosylceramide was expressed as percentage of cpm in these classes of lipids out of the total lipid tritium in the sample. For radiographs, the TLC plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE® according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to film (Hyperfilm; AmershamBiosciences) at −80 °C for 3–7 days. 4-HPR content in endothelial cell pellets was determined by HPLC using UV absorbance detection in a modification of the method used by Le Doze et al. (32Le Doze F. Debruyne D. Albessard F. Barre L. Defer G.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar). Weighed pellets of treated cells were homogenized in 1 ml of acetonitrile and centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. Human BMEC cultured in 10-cm dishes were placed on ice, rinsed twice (ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline), and scraped into 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell suspensions were sonicated over ice at 20% output, alternating a 15-s sonication with 20-s pause for four cycles, using a Micro Ultrasonic Cell Disrupter from Kontes (Vineland, NJ). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was isolated and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The microsomal membrane pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of homogenization buffer by sonication for 5 s and was frozen at −80 °C (33Holleran W.M. Williams M.L. Gao W.N. Elias P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1655-1661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]serine into 3-ketosphinganine (34Wang H.

Each tube (0.1-ml final volume) contained 100 μg of microsomal protein in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 mm l-serine. After preincubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was initiated by the simultaneous addition of palmitoyl-CoA (0.2 mm) and 1.0 μCi of [3H]serine. Control samples contained either boiled microsomes or no protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 7 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 ml of 0.5 n NH4OH. Organic-soluble products were isolated by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1), 25 μg of sphingosine carrier, and 2.0 ml of 0.5 n NH4OH. The washed organic phase was isolated, and 1.0 ml was dried under a stream of nitrogen and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting (33Holleran W.M. Williams M.L. Gao W.N. Elias P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1655-1661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]sphinganine into [3H]dihydroceramide (34Wang H.

Sphinganine in chloroform/methanol (2:1) was dried under nitrogen and dissolved to 10 μm with sonication, in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, prior to the addition of microsomal protein (100 μg) to a final reaction volume of 0.1 ml. Assays were initiated by the simultaneous addition of palmitoyl-CoA (0.1 mm) and 0.5 μCi of [3H]sphinganine followed by incubation at 37 °C for 40 min with gentle shaking. The reaction was terminated by lipid extraction. [3H]dihydroceramide was isolated by TLC and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0c for MacIntosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Values are given as means ± S.E. When two means were compared, p values were based on the t test (unpaired or paired, depending on the experimental design). When three or more means were compared, the overall p value was based on the F-test from an analysis of variance (ANOVA). If the means were based on doses or times (i.e. on a continuum), then thep value was based on the test for trend using linear regression. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Since only one of two reports found 4-HPR to be cytotoxic to endothelial cells, we determined the cytotoxicity of 4-HPR in human BMEC (Fig. 1). 4-HPR was cytotoxic to human BMEC in a dose-dependent manner as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, with 50% cytotoxicity at 2.4 ± 0.2 μm (S.E.) and 90% cytotoxicity at 5.3 ± 0.5 μm 4-HPR when incubated in medium containing 0.1% FBS (Fig. 1 A). Assessment by trypan blue exclusion and DIMSCAN (digital imaging microscopy (20Maurer B.J. Metelitsa L.S. Seeger R.C. Cabot M.C. Reynolds C.P. J. Natl.

Cytotoxicity was similar in low passage (passages 14–30) and high passage (passages 40–57) human BMEC, with 50% cytotoxicity at a mean 4-HPR of 2.2 ± 0.3 and 2.6 ± 0.2 μm, respectively (n = 10 and 11; p = 0.32 by unpairedt test). With HUVEC, 50 and 90% cytotoxicity was achieved at 3.1 and 9.0 μm 4-HPR, respectively (n= 10, p < 0.001 by one-way ANOVA), and in bovine TBMEC, 5 μm 4-HPR induced 98% cytotoxicity (n = 10, p < 0.001 by unpairedt test compared with control cells). Thus, 4-HPR was cytotoxic to both human and bovine BMEC as well as in HUVEC. Some growth factors can activate survival signaling pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt cascade to protect them from apoptosis, as shown for insulin- and insulin-like growth factor-1-mediated inhibition of anoikis (36Yu J.T. Foster R.G. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3325-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether FBS could rescue endothelial cells from 4-HPR-mediated cytotoxicity. Including 1–10% FBS in the medium diminished 4-HPR-induced cytotoxicity in human BMEC, bovine TBMEC, and HUVEC compared with 0.1% FBS when measured at 24 h (Fig. 1,B and C).2 The addition of bovine serum albumin to the medium did not suppress the cytotoxic effect of 4-HPR (Fig. 1 C), indicating that protection by FBS was not due to binding of the drug to the albumin in the FBS. Protection by serum suggested that 4-HPR could be inducing apoptosis in the endothelial cells. Indeed, human BMEC exposed to 4-HPR demonstrated an increase in the sub-G0/G1 DNA content indicative of apoptosis as revealed by flow cytometry (representative experiments shown in Fig. 2, Aand B). We then examined whether serum protected the cells from 4-HPR-induced apoptosis. At 24 h, 10% FBS completely abrogated the 4-HPR-mediated apoptosis even in the presence of 7.5 μm 4-HPR (Fig. 2 C). Since in some tumor cell lines induction of apoptosis by 4-HPR requires longer exposures (37Puduvalli V.K. Saito Y. Xu R. Kouraklis G.P. Levin V.A. Kyritsis A.P. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2230-2235PubMed Google Scholar,38Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Prostate. 1997; 33: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we also examined the apoptotic effect of 4-HPR in the presence of 10% FBS at 48 and 72 h. Indeed, in 1–10% FBS, the apoptotic effect of 4-HPR was restored with longer incubations (Fig. 2,D and E). To examine the possibility that the delay in apoptosis was due to binding of 4-HPR to the FBS, we determined 4-HPR content in human BMEC in medium containing 0.1–10% FBS. Fig. 2 F demonstrates that cellular 4-HPR content was similar in cells treated in culture medium with 0.1 and 1% FBS and was decreased in 10% FBS. In order to maintain controlled conditions and minimize overconfluence of cells at the high FBS concentrations during longer incubations, subsequent experiments were performed in medium containing 0.1–1% FBS. Ceramide is thought to mediate endothelial apoptosis by stress stimuli (5Erdreich-Epstein A. Shimada H. Groshen S. Liu M. Metelitsa L.S. Kim K.S. Stins M.F. Seeger R.C. Durden D.L.

We studied the biological characteristics of these tumours by comparing the overexpression of oncogenes ERBB2, MYC, CCND1 and RHOC and TP53 gene mutation rates in IBC with those found in locally advanced and not otherwise specified breast cancers. The prevalence of the TP53 mutation was much higher in IBC than in the two other types of cancer (57% vs 30). Unexpectedly, however, in IBC tumours, histological grade was independent of TP53 status. In addition, ERBB2 overexpression was twice as frequent in inflammatory as in non-inflammatory tumours, whereas the frequencies of MYC, CCND1 and RHOC overexpression did not vary significantly among the three types of breast cancer. These findings suggest that IBC tumours constitute a distinct subset with a specific pathogenesis. Given the importance of TP53 and ERBB2 in the response to treatments, our observations have important therapeutic implications for the clinical management of IBC patients."

The mechanism of PAX6 function is not clearly understood, and few target genes in vertebrates have been identified. In this report we described the functional analyses of patient missense mutations from the paired domain region of PAX6 and a paireddomain-less isoform (PD-less) of Pax6 that lacks the paired domain and part of the glycine-rich linker. The PD-less was expressed in the brain, eyes, and pancreas of mouse. The level of expression of this isoform was relatively higher in brain. The mutation sites PAX6-L46R and -C52R were located in the PD of PAX6 on either end of the 5a-polypeptide insert of the alternatively spliced form of PAX6, PAX6-5a. Another PAX6 mutant V53L described in this report was adjacent to C52R. We created corresponding mutations in PAX6 and PAX6-5a, and evaluated their transcriptional activation and DNA binding properties. The PD mutants of PAX6 (L46R, C52R, and V53L) exhibited lower transactivation activities and variable DNA binding ability than wild-type PAX6 with PD DNA-binding consensus sequences. The mutated amino acids containing PAX6-5a isoforms showed unexpected transactivation properties with a reporter containing HD DNA-binding sequences. PAX6-5a-C52R, and -V53L showed lower transactivation activities, but PAX6-5a-L46R had greater transactivation ability than PAX6-5a. The PD-less isoform of Pax6 lost its transactivational ability but could bind to the HD DNA-binding sequences. Functional analysis of the PD-less isoform of Pax6 as well as findings related to missense mutations in the PD suggest that the PD of PAX6 is required for HD function.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1716-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), identification of target genes of PAX6 has been hindered by two factors. First, the PD of Pax6 can bind to a broad range of DNA sequences. Second, HDs in other proteins recognize similar sequences, as does the Pax6 HD (43Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C.

However, it is not clear how mutation of the PAX6 gene results in these various phenotypes, and why the phenotypes are of variable expressivities. Functional studies usingPAX6 missense mutations with observed developmental defects are useful in understanding the mechanism of PAX6 function. Missense mutations in the DNA-binding domains of PAX6 may cause failure to properly recognize binding sites in the target genes, resulting in partial or complete loss of protein function (40Tang H.K.

In this report, we describe the functional properties of three missense mutations in the PD domain of PAX6 that were identified in the DNA of patients with aniridia, and a PD-less isoform of Pax6 from mouse. Since patients with aniridia also have the PAX6-5a isoform, and Pax6-5a was found to be important in maintaining the normal structure of eyes in adult mice (33Singh S. Mishra R. Arango N.A. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. Saunders G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6812-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), these mutations on either end of the 5a-polypeptide insert have been used to examine the role of the PAX6-5a isoform. The results indicate that the functional properties of PAX6 and the PAX6-5a isoform are unique, and PD of PAX6 is required for the function of HD. To identify mutations in the PAX6 gene, genomic DNA samples were isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with aniridia. Each exon and its immediate flanking sequence was amplified by PCR with primer sets described previously (50Love J. Axton R. Churchill A. van Heyningen V. Hanson I. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 12: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Gel analysis and sequence confirmation were performed as described earlier (26Chao L.Y. Huff V. Strong L.C. Saunders G.F. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The missense mutations in PAX6 and PAX6-5a were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All constructs were assessed by automated sequencing to ensure that no random mutations were introduced during PCR. Construction of the CD19-2(A-ins)-luciferase and P2-luciferse reporter plasmids has been described previously (47Singh S. Stellrecht C.M. Tang H.K. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17306-17313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CD19-2(A-ins) (5′-TACTCGAGCTGGGCACTGAGGCGTGACCATTTTCCTGAATTCCA-3′) and P2 (5′-TCGAGGGCATCAGGATGCTAATTGATTAGCATCCGATCGGG-3′) are consensus DNA-binding sequences of PAX6 PD and HD, respectively. NIH/3T3, a murine fibroblast cell line, was maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed with plasmid DNA coated with the polycationic lipid LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each well in a 12-well plate was transfected with 0.2 μg of P2-luciferase or CD19-2 (A-ins)-luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.3 μg of pRc-CMV effector plasmids (containing wild-type or mutant PAX6 and/or PAX6-5a cDNA), and 0.05 μg of pSV2β-gal plasmid (Promega Corp.) as an internal control. An equivalent amount of vector plasmid pRc-CMV or pcDNA3 vectors were used as vector control. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (47Singh S. Stellrecht C.M. Tang H.K. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17306-17313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity. The average values of three independent transfection experiments are shown as mean relative levels of luciferase activity compared with the basal level obtained with empty vectors. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected NIH/3T3 cells as previously described (51Singh S. Saunders G.F. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In vitro-transcribed and -translated proteins were generated using the transcription and translation (TnT)-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp.) with the pRc-CMV construct containing wild-type or mutant PAX6 and/or PAX6-5a cDNA. The amount of PAX6 protein expressed or translated was quantitated by Western blot analysis with antibodies against the linker region of PAX6. The bands on the Western blots were quantitated using a Personal Densitometer Scanner 1.30 and Image Quant 3.3 software (Molecular Dynamics). Occasionally, quantitation of in vitrosynthesized 35S-labeled proteins were further confirmed by drying SDS-PAGE gels and analyzing by using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and Image Quant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics). EMSA was performed to compare the DNA binding ability of the PAX6 and PAX6-5a isoform proteins bearing patient mutations.

EMSAs for CD19-2(A-ins) were carried out as described previously (47Singh S. Stellrecht C.M. Tang H.K. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17306-17313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The binding reactions for P6CON, BSAP, ZPE, and P2 were carried out, in a volume of 20 μl, with 0.5–4 μl of proteins, 4 fmol of labeled DNA probe (2 fmol for P2), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), in 20 mmHEPES (pH 8.0), 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.50 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at room temperature and run on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in (Tris glycine/EDTA) buffer at 4 °C. For competition experiments, unlabeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides probes were used in excess. The in vitro translated PAX6 and PAX6-5a normal and mutant proteins (0.5 and 1 μl for P6CON, 2 and 4 μl for CD19-2(A-ins), BSAP, ZPE, and P2) were used for EMSA. The gels were dried and analyzed with a PhosphorImager followed by autoradiography on Kodak X-Omat AR films. The expression vector with the PD-less isoform ofPax6 was constructed using the PCR approach. PCR products corresponding to the coding region of the PD-less isoform were cloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector (53Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring the 5′-untranslated region of the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene. To amplify specifically the PD-less isoform we designed primers that locate the junction between exons 3 and 8: PD-lessF, 5′-CAAAACTCTTGACAGGAAGGAG-3′ and reverse primer from exon 12; Pax612R, 5′-ACTTGGACGGGAACTGACAC-3′. These two primers allowed us specifically to amplify the PD-less isoform. RT-PCR products (∼500 bp) were detected in the brain, eye, and pancreas. Identity of the band to the Pax6 sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The GenBankTMaccession number of the PD-less isoform is AY064175. In this report, we describe the functional analyses of three missense mutations from aniridia patients detected in the PD region of PAX6 and a PD-less isoform of Pax6 from mouse. The results indicate that the functional properties of PAX6 and the PAX6-5a isoform are unique and PD of PAX6 is required for the function of HD. Missense mutations change amino acid residues that alter the polarity and conformation of the proteins. The missense mutation L46R causes substitution of a positively charged amino acid, arginine, in place of nonpolar (i.e. hydrophobic) leucine. The patient has atrophy of both pupil and iris. This was a familial case where the mother had congenital cataracts and nystagmus, maternal grandmother had bilateral cataracts, and a misshaped pupil. In the case of missense mutation C52R there was substitution of a positively charged amino acid arginine in place of an uncharged and polar cysteine amino acid residue. The patient had aniridia and cataracts. This was also a familial case, and the mother had juvenile cataracts and glaucoma. 2Chao, L. Y., Mishra, R., Strong, L. C., and Saunders, G. F. (2002) Hum. Mutat., in press. Another highly conserved amino acid residue of PAX6 valine, is replaced by a bulky leucine without a net charge difference in the case of the missense mutation PAX6-V53L. The patient had moderate photophobia (24Gronskov K. Rosenberg T. Sand A. Brondum-Nielsen K. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 7: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). These missense mutations were located in the PD-binding domain of PAX6 and are highly conserved in both PAX6 and the entire paired family (18Xu H.E. Rould M.A. Xu W. Epstein J.A. Maas R.L. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant PAX6 and PAX6-5a proteins were stable as analyzed by Western blot analyses after in vitro translation (Fig.1 B ) or in nuclear extracts (Fig. 1 C) prepared after transfection with expression constructs of wild-type and mutant PAX6 and PAX6-5a cDNA. To assess the functional significance of the missense mutations in the different domains of PAX6, we compared the mutant and wild-type PAX6 proteins by transcriptional activation assays and DNA binding abilities. NIH/3T3 cells were co-transfected with PAX6 or mutant PAX6 expression plasmids with a luciferase reporter plasmid bearing two copies of either the PD-binding consensus sequences (CD19-2(A-ins)) or the HD-binding consensus sequences (P2). The property of binding site recognition by PAX6 or PAX6-5a was tested by EMSA with consensus binding sequences of PD (CD19-2A), P6CON, (13Epstein J.A. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S.

When the reporter plasmid containing the PD-binding consensus sequence (CD19-2(A-ins) was used, wild-type PAX6 could activate the reporter but PAX6-5a had basal levels of activity (Fig. 2 A). The ability of the PAX6-L46R, -C52R, and -V53L mutants to activate transcription of the reporter gene was significantly lower than that of the wild-type PAX6, and PAX6-5a or PAX6-5a mutants failed to activate the luciferase reporter with (CD19-2(A-ins) (Fig. 2 B). When CD19-2(A-ins) was used as a probe for EMSA, PAX6 mutants showed variable binding ability. PAX6-L46R and -C52R failed to bind, and PAX6-V53L showed about 50% lower binding ability than wild-type PAX6. PAX6-5a and mutants showed no binding to CD19-2(A-ins) (Fig.2 C). Unlike CD19-2(A-ins) PAX6-L46R showed 40% lower binding to P6CON, PAX6-C52R did not bind, and PAX6-V53L has similar binding ability compared with wild-type PAX6. PAX6-5a and mutants failed to bind P6CON (Fig.3 A). When the BSAP was used as a probe to test the DNA binding capability, PAX6 had binding ability, but the PAX6-5a and mutants failed to bind this consensus sequence. (Fig. 3 B). Like CD19-2(A-ins) PAX6 could bind to ZPE, but mutants PAX6-L46R and -C52R failed to bind, and -V53L showed 50% lower binding than the wild-type PAX6 (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3EMSA for PD function.

The binding reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both PAX6 and PAX6-5a could transactivate the reporter containing P2, and the level of activity by the PAX6-5a was about 50% of the wild-type PAX6 (Fig.4 A). Some of the missense mutations in the PD and PST domains also affect HD functions. Activation of a reporter containing the HD-binding sequences (P2) by PAX6 mutants V53L was significantly lower than that of wild-type PAX6. Interestingly mutants C52R and V53L of the PAX6-5a isoform lost their transactivation abilities when used to activate the reporter containing P2, whereas PAX6-5a-L46R exhibited greater transactivation ability than normal PAX6-5a (Fig. 4 B). When P2 was used as a probe, PAX6 and PAX6-5a mutant proteins had similar HD binding capabilities (Fig.4 C). A new alternatively spliced isoform of Pax6 (PD-less) (AY064175) was isolated from mouse brain cDNA. This isoform of Pax6 lacks the promoter 1-specific exon as well as common exons 2, 4–7 and the first 21 nucleotides of exon 8 (Fig. 5 A). This isoform resulted from the use of a cryptic acceptor splice site in exon 8 as well as the normal donor/acceptor sites in exon 2(P1) and the normal donor site in exon 3. Conceptual translation of the sequence generated a 221-amino acid protein lacking the paired domain and part of the glycine-rich linker (Fig. 5 B). The PD-less isoform of Pax6 was found to be expressed in brain, eyes, and pancreas of mouse. The level of expression of this isoform was relatively higher in brain (Fig. 5 C). Translation of this expression vector in cultured cells show that the PD-less isoform is stable (Fig. 5, D andE). To further verify that both PD- and HD of the Pax6 act cooperatively in the induction of gene expression, we performed the functional analysis of the PD-less isoform of the Pax6. If HD and PD of Pax6 act independently, then one can expect that the removal of the paired domain should not affect the activities of the HD. However, the PD-less isoform of Pax6 fails to activate the reporter containing HD DNA-binding sequences (P2) (Fig. 5 F). The PD-less isoform of Pax6 could bind to P2 (Fig. 5 G) but failed to bind PD DNA-binding consensus sequences P6CON,CD19-2(A-ins) and ZPE compared with normal Pax6 (Fig. 6,A–C). The DNA-binding domains of PAX6 are highly conserved among animal species. The diverse functions of Pax6 appear to originate from both the complex regulatory mechanisms controlling the tissue-specific transcription and splicing as well as its ability to participate in multiple molecular interactions (54Chauhan B.K. Reed N.A. Zhang W. Duncan M.K. Kilimann M.W. Cvekl A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Missense mutations in the DNA-binding domains of PAX6 may result in failure to properly recognize the binding sites in normal target genes, thus causing partial or complete loss- or gain-of-function. The loss-of-function may also be due to impaired interaction between DNA-binding domains or failure of cofactor-mediated functions. In order to understand the mechanism of PAX6 function we performed functional analysis of missense mutations found in the PD region of PAX6 and alternatively spliced form of PAX6, PAX6-5a, of aniridia patients (Fig. 1). We also performed functional analyses of a PD-less isoform of Pax6 (AY064175), which was found to be expressed in the brain, eyes, and pancreas of mice. The level of expression of PD-less isoform was relatively higher in brain (Fig. 5 C). Missense mutations described in this paper (PAX6 and PAX6-5a) -L46R, -C52R, and -V53L) are found in the DNA-binding region of PD and located on either end of the 5a-polypeptide insert in the PAX6-5a isoform. The expressed proteins were found to be stable (Fig. 1, A–C). Among the mutations in the N subdomain of PD, L46R is present in the α2-helix, and C52R and V53L are located in α3-helix. This N subdomain uses a helix-turn-helix (HTH) unit to dock against the major groove at one end of the binding site (18Xu H.E. Rould M.A. Xu W. Epstein J.A. Maas R.L. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). As compared with wild-type PAX6, the PAX6-5a isoform could not transactivate the luciferase reporter gene containing target DNA-binding consensus sequences CD19-2(A-ins) for PD (Fig. 2 A). PAX6 mutants PAX6-L46R, -C52R, and -V53L showed significantly lower transactivation ability than wild-type PAX6 (Fig. 2 B) with luciferase reporter containing CD19-2(A-ins). EMSA results with CD19-2(A-ins) showed that PAX6-L46R and -C52R lost their binding abilities, and -V53L showed significantly lower binding ability than wild-type PAX6 (Fig.2 C). PAX6-5a and its respective mutants did not show transactivation or binding ability with the PD target sequences as insertion of the 5a-polypeptide disrupts its PD binding capability (13Epstein J.A. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar,32Kozmik Z. Czerny T. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6793-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These mutants showed variable DNA binding abilities with other Pax6-binding consensus sequences like P6CON, BSAP, and ZPE (Fig. 3,A–C). The mutated amino acids of PAX6 described here are highly conserved within the PD and are present in the DNA-binding region of the PD. The missense mutation L46R causes substitution of a positively charged amino acid, arginine, in place of nonpolar leucine, and C52R leads to substitution of a positively charged arginine in place of an uncharged and polar cysteine amino acid residue. These two mutations impaired both DNA binding and transcriptional activation abilities of PAX6. In the case of the V53L missense mutation (24Gronskov K. Rosenberg T. Sand A. Brondum-Nielsen K. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 7: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) valine was replaced by the bulky amino acid residue leucine, but the net charge remained the same. The PAX6 mutants L46R, and C52R might have lost their activity as they were unable to bind the DNA, while the V to L substitution at codon 53 retained binding ability but turned the protein into a transcriptional repressor or perhaps lost the conformation used to recruit the all cofactors used for transactivation. The variable properties of these PD mutants led to analysis of their HD function. The PAX6-5a isoform had about 50% lower transactivation ability compared with the wild-type PAX6 (Fig. 4 A) with the luciferase reporter containing HD-binding consensus sequences (P2). The missense mutations in the PD of PAX6 and PAX6-5a showed some unusual transactivation properties (Fig. 4 B) with the P2-containing luciferase reporter. These mutants have almost identical HD DNA binding abilities (Fig. 4 C) to that of wild-type PAX6 and PAX6-5a, but they show variable transactivation properties. The variable functional properties of PAX6 mutant may be one of the factors for variable phenotype of aniridia patients. PAX6 PD mutant V53L had significantly lower transactivation ability than wild-type PAX6. Thus PD mutant V53L affects both PD and HD functions. Interestingly, PAX6-5a-L46R showed a significantly higher transactivation ability than wild-type PAX6-5a. However, it behaves like wild-type PAX6 as far as HD-related transactivation is concerned. Furthermore, PAX6-5a-C52R, and -V53L mutants showed significantly lower transactivation activities. The PD-less isoform of Pax6 fails to activate the reporter containing HD DNA-binding sequences (P2) (Fig. 5 F) despite its binding ability to the P2 probe (Fig. 5 G). It failed to bind the PD DNA-binding consensus sequences P6CON,CD19-2(A-ins) and ZPE as compared with normal Pax6 (Fig. 6, A–C). These results indicate that the HD can bind to DNA but requires the PD for its transactivation function. Additionally, it may have some special regulatory role in the brain, eyes and pancreas as evident from its expression pattern (Fig.5 C). A similar paired-less isoform was identified earlier in two phylogenicaly distinct species, quail (55Carriere C. Plaza S. Martin P. Quatannens B. Bailly M. Stehelin D. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7257-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (56Zhang Y. Emmons S.W. Nature. 1995; 377: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and these findings suggest some normal function for the PD-less isoform (57Dozier C. Carriere C. Grevin D. Martin P. Quatannens B. Stehelin D. Saule S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 281-289PubMed Google Scholar). If HD and PD of Pax6 act independently, then one can expect that the removal of the paired domain should not affect the activities of the HD. These findings, at the level of in vitro DNA binding and transactivation assays, indicate a complex state of regulation of PAX6 function. The PD mutant V53L affects HD function. PAX6-5a mutants (L46R, C52R, and V53L) also alter activity with HD. These findings support our previous ideas of PD-dependent HD function (51Singh S. Saunders G.F. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar,58Singh S. Tang H.K. Lee J.Y. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21531-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and are in agreement with a possible cooperative interaction between the PD and HD of PAX6 (59Bertuccioli C. Fasano L. Jun S. Wang S. Sheng G. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2673-2685PubMed Google Scholar). Recently intradomain and interdomain interactions in PAX6 have also been reported (15Mikkola I. Bruun J.A. Holm T. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4109-4118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Punzo C. Kurata S. Gehring W.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1716-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that support the concept that the PD and HD of PAX6 physically interact. Two possibilities of how the PD can influence the function of the HD are the following. Gain-of-function suggests that normally the PD does not interact with the HD and mutations in the PD result in misfolding of the PAX6 protein such that the PD interferes with HD function. Alternatively, loss-of-function suggests that PD and HD of PAX6 physically interact, and mutations within the PD affect the function of HD. Although the different domains of PAX6 are well delineated, their functions appear to be mutually dependent, and the PD of PAX6 is required for HD function.

Lee et al. (29Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.J. Lee J.S., Ha, S.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol.

Because cellular actin exists in a dynamic equilibrium between monomeric, G-actin, and filamentous F-actin, we sought to characterize further the physical and functional interactions between actin and PLD to answer the following questions. 1) Do PLD enzymes bind both G-actin and F-actin? 2) Do these interactions occur both in vitro and in vivo? 3) Do monomeric and filamentous actin exhibit similar effects on PLD activity?DISCUSSIONThe critical importance of cellular functions that are coordinately regulated by PLD and actin, including proliferation, migration, vesicle trafficking, and secretion, underscores the need to define the physical and functional interactions between these molecular families. We (27Iyer S.S. Kusner D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and others (28Hodgkin M.N. Clark J.M. Rose S. Saqib K. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that PLD1 physically associates with the detergent-insoluble actin cytoskeleton, in a constitutive and stimulation-enhanced manner. On the functional level, evidence has been presented for the involvement of PLD in formation of actin stress fibers in intact cells (10Ha K.S. Exton J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 123: 1789-1796Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11Ha K.S. Yeo E.J. Exton J.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Cross M.J. Roberts S.

Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the converse possibility that actin may regulate PLD activity has remained relatively unexplored. Recently, Lee et al. (29Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.J. Lee J.S., Ha, S.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported that β-actin inhibited mammalian PLD2 and PLD1 in vitro. Our results confirm and significantly extend the work of Lee et al. (29Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.J. Lee J.S., Ha, S.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) in several important ways. First, actin exertedbimodal modulation of PLD1 activity; monomeric G-actin inhibited PLD, whereas F-actin enhanced stimulation of PLD. Second, this biphasic modulation of PLD1 activity was demonstrated bothin vivo and in vitro. Third, actin-mediated modulation of PLD1 activity was stimulus-independent, affecting its activation by both GTP-binding proteins and PKC. Fourth, actin monomer-sequestering agents, including the physiologic G-actin-binding protein, DNase I, activated PLD1 in resting cells, cell extracts, and purified membranes, suggesting a novel mechanism of PLD stimulation. Fifth, PLD1 was physically associated with both G-actin and actin filaments, supporting the hypothesis that actin is a physiologic regulator of PLD activity. Sixth, the functional effects of actin on PLD were isoform-specific; α-actin was more than twice as potent and efficacious as βγ-actin, suggesting the possibility of tissue selectivity/specificity in actin-mediated regulation of PLD. Seventh, the modulatory effects of actin on PLD activity were broadly conserved throughout eukaryotic species, from single-celled yeast to humans.The most important advance provided in this report is that actin bidirectionally modulates PLD activity in a polymerization-dependent manner. The critical aspect of this modulation is the potent inhibition of PLD by G-actin. Because reductions of free G-actin by either monomer sequestration or induction of polymerization are both associated with increases in PLD activity (despite differing effects on levels of F-actin), we hypothesize that the amount of G-actin complexed to PLD is the primary determinant of the effects of actin. Notably, these effects of G-actin depletion are evident in both resting cells and the unstimulated cell-free reconstitution assay. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of activation of mammalian PLD1 by a mechanism distinct from LMW GTPases or PKC. The increases in PLD activity induced by phalloidin-stabilized F-actin support an independent positive effect of actin filaments on PLD activity. Along with previous work establishing a role for PLD in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements (10Ha K.S. Exton J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 123: 1789-1796Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11Ha K.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) suggest that PLD enzymes and G- and F-actin function in a coordinately regulated system. These complex functional interactions are likely to account for the co-involvement of PLD and the actin cytoskeleton in many essential cellular processes (2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 5Exton J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The data in this article concur with those of Lee et al.(29Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.J. Lee J.S., Ha, S.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to the extent that addition of purified β-actin inhibits activation of PLD by LMW GTPases in vitro. An important extension of our work is the demonstration that PKC-induced PLD activity is inhibited in a quantitatively and kinetically similar manner. This stimulus independence of actin-mediated inhibition, as well as its kinetic characteristics (Fig. 1), strongly suggests that G-actin blocks the formation of a catalytically active PLD complex. Because all eukaryotic membranes (plasma membrane, Golgi, nuclear membrane, etc.) have a tightly associated actin skeleton (61Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 62De M. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2331-2343PubMed Google Scholar, 63Klotz K.L. Krotec K. Gripentrog J. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 801-810PubMed Google Scholar), PLD enzymes will necessarily encounter actin in the context of substrate binding and catalysis. Thus, we propose a model in which actin, both monomeric G-actin and F-actin filaments, are fundamental participants in the catalytic cycle of mammalian PLD (Fig. 6). This model is complemented by recent evidence that membrane rafts, the glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane domains in which PLD1 and PLD2 are preferentially localized (27Iyer S.S. Kusner D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 64Kim J.H. Han J.M. Lee S. Kim Y. Lee T.G. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H.

Thus, actin-mediated regulation of PLD is likely to be spatially coupled to dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton.The physical interactions responsible for these functional effects are beginning to be defined. Lee et al. (29Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.J. Lee J.S., Ha, S.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of actin in anti-PLD immunoprecipitates from cells overexpressing PLD. We have extended their important findings by demonstrating the following: (a) endogenous PLD1 associated with both G-actin and F-actin, (b) these physical interactions differentially modified PLD activity, and (c) these interactions occurred in intact cells, a cell-free reconstitution system, and in purified membranes. Mammalian PLD enzymes have been extremely difficult to purify. This challenge has limited our ability to resolve the binding interactions between PLD1 and G- or F-actin at the molecular level. Anti-PLD immunoprecipitates, obtained with the three different anti-peptide Abs described above, and utilizing a broad spectrum of detergents, all contained many proteins in addition to actin (not shown). This is not surprising because the affinity of PLD for detergent-insoluble membrane domains has been characterized previously (27Iyer S.S. Kusner D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 65Czarny M. Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Liscovitch M. J. Biol.

It is important to note that Lee et al. (29Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.J. Lee J.S., Ha, S.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) did not report the purity of the PLD preparations used in their study. Because purified preparations of mammalian PLDs are required to test the hypothesis of a direct interaction with actin, we conclude that the mechanism by which mammalian PLDs bind actin is not yet defined. In contrast, we have utilized bacterial and plant PLDs that have been purified to homogeneity to address definitively whether PLD enzymes bind directly to G- and/or F-actin. 2D. J. Kusner, J. A. Barton, C. Qin, X. Wang, and S. S. Iyer, submitted for publication.Another important difference between the work of Lee et al.(29Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.J. Lee J.S., Ha, S.H.

Because several actin-binding proteins (ABPs), including fodrin and α-actinin, potently inhibit PLD activity (IC50 1–10 nm) (47Lukowski S. Lecomte M.-C. Mira J.-P. Marin P. Gautero H. Russo-Marie F.

Both the α-actin and βγ-actin used in this work were greater than >99% pure (by protein staining with Coomassie Blue and Sypro Ruby Red). Furthermore, Western blotting with Abs to prevalent ABPs, including fodrin, α-actinin, paxillin, talin and vinculin, were negative (not shown). Lee et al. (29Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported a purity of >90% for their β-actin preparation, and no information regarding potential contamination by ABPs was provided. Gelsolin, another ABP, has been alternatively reported to activate (48Steed P.M. Nagar S. Wennogle L.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5229-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or inhibit PLD (49Banno Y. Fujita H. Ono Y. Nakashima S. Ito Y. Kuzumaki N. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27385-27391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Perhaps differential effects and/or amounts of actin in these experimental systems contributed to the reported divergent impacts of exogenous gelsolin on PLD activity.In summary, mammalian PLD1 associates with both monomeric G-actin and filamentous F-actin, with significant functional consequences for the regulation of PLD activity. These physical and functional interactions with actin are isoform-specific and independent of the PLD-activating stimulus. Further study will be required to establish the molecular details and physiologic roles of PLD-actin interactions in the multiple critical cellular responses associated with these protein families. Phospholipase D (PLD)1enzymes have been identified throughout the animal and plant kingdoms and are located in all cells and tissues of metazoans (1Exton J.H. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 1-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 3Wang X. Prog.

PLD functions in several essential cellular processes, including cytoskeletal remodeling, proliferation, motility, and membrane trafficking as well as in several highly specialized activities characteristic of terminally differentiated cells (4Olson S.C. Lambeth J.D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous distribution and diverse physiologic functions of PLD enzymes underscore the critical importance of defining the molecular mechanisms of regulation and characterizing the biochemical pathways that link its catalytic activity to such a broad range of cellular responses. Two mammalian PLD isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, have been molecularly characterized (2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 5Exton J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Sung T.C. Zhang Y. Morris A.J.

PLD1 is activated by low molecular weight (LMW) GTPases of the Rho and ARF families, as well as by protein kinase C (PKC). PLD2 exhibits high basal activity and appears to be primarily subject to negative regulation in vivo, although evidence for specific activators has recently been presented (8Lopez I. Arnold R.S.

A distinctive feature of the mammalian PLDs is their functional association with the actin-based microfilament cytoskeleton (2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem.

In this sense, immunological factors and inflammation mediators, including complement proteins and pro-inflammatory peptides generated at different stages of complement activation (4Eikelenboom P. Stam F.C. Acta. Neuropathol. 1982; 57: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) as well as various cytokines (5Berkenbosch F. Biewenga J. Bouns M. Rozemuller M. Strijbos P. van Dam A. Res. Immunol. 1992; 143: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), have been implicated in accelerating the progression of AD. The complement system is a highly regulated, powerful effector mechanism of the immune system that destroys and clears deleterious substances. It is composed of more than twenty proteins that become sequentially activated in a proteolytic cascade. Originally, activation of the complement system was thought to occur only by binding of immune complexes to C1q, the recognition component of the classical pathway. However, it became then evident that the complement system can directly be activated, in the absence of antibody, by interaction of certain foreign molecules with C3 (alternative activation pathway), C1q (antibody-independent classical activation pathway), or by specific lectins on the surface of certain microorganisms (lectin activation pathway) (3Emmerling M.R.

Aging. 2001; 22: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The first step in the classical complement pathway involves the binding of an activator to C1q resulting in the subsequent conversion of the serine proesterases C1r and C1s to their active forms and, in turn, in the activation of C4, C2, and then C3. The alternative pathway differs from the classic pathway in that activation begins at the level of C3 and involves factors B and D and Properdin. Proteolytic modification of C3 by either pathway leads to the cleavage of C5 and the incorporation of C6, C7, C8, and multiple molecules of C9 resulting in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), C5b-9, a transmembrane channel capable to produce cell lysis (8Morgan B.P. Complement Methods and Protocols. 2000 Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey2000Crossref Google Scholar). Activation-derived proteins of both the classical and alternative pathways have been demonstrated in association with AD lesions by numerous groups (3Emmerling M.R. Watson M.D. Raby C.A. Spiegel K. Biochim. Byophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 158-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We investigated the complement activation cascade in chromosome 13 dementias, two hereditary conditions, familial British dementia (FBD) and familial Danish dementia (FDD), that are also associated with neurodegeneration and amyloid deposition in the central nervous system. FBD has been described in members of three British pedigrees and is characterized clinically by dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and spastic paraparesis with the disease onset typically in the fourth to fifth decade of life and death occurring some ten years later (9Mead S.

FDD is a disease associated with a single Danish family with the onset of cataracts in patients before the age of thirty. Affected family members subsequently develop sensory hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, psychosis, and dementia leading to death between the ages of fifty and sixty years (10Holton J. Lashley T. Ghiso J. Braendgaard H. Vidal R. Guerin C. Gibb G. Hanger D.P. Rostagno A. Anderton B. Strand C. Ayling H. Plant G. Frangione B. Bojsen-Moller M. Revesz T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The neuropathology in both diseases is remarkably similar to that seen in AD, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy, pre-amyloid lesions, amyloid plaques of various types, and NFTs, ultrastructurally composed of paired helical filaments with an electrophoretic pattern of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau indistinguishable from that observed in AD. Activated microglia, expressing the major histocompatibility class II antigens that are characteristic of inflammatory processes, can be demonstrated around amyloid plaques and dystrophic neurites but not in pre-amyloid lesions in both FBD and FDD (10Holton J. Lashley T. Ghiso J. Braendgaard H. Vidal R. Guerin C. Gibb G. Hanger D.P. Rostagno A. Anderton B. Strand C. Ayling H. Plant G. Frangione B. Bojsen-Moller M. Revesz T. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

In these disorders the deposited amyloid proteins, ABri in FBD and ADan in FDD, are proteolytic fragments of a larger precursor molecule BriPP codified by a multiexonic gene BRI2(also known as ITM2B) located on the long arm of chromosome 13 (12–14). The amyloid peptides originate as a result of two different genetic defects, namely a Stop-to-Arg mutation in FBD and a ten-nucleotide duplication-insertion immediately before the stop codon in FDD. Regardless of the nucleotide changes, the final outcome is common to both diseases: the ordinarily occurring stop codon is not in-frame causing the genesis of an extended precursor featuring a C-terminal piece that does not exist in normal conditions. Thesede novo created amyloid peptides, with no sequence identity to any known amyloid protein, are both 34-residues long, share 100% homology of the first 22 residues, and have a completely different 12-amino acid C terminus. When deposited, both ABri and ADan feature pyroglutamate at their N terminus, a post-translational modification also identified in some truncated amyloid species isolated from Alzheimer's disease brains, i.e. AβpE3 and AβpE11 (15Saido T.

The results presented here show (i) the co-localization of complement activation products with amyloid plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in FBD and FDD and (ii) the activation of both the classical and the alternative pathways of the complement system by synthetic peptides representing the main species deposited in both disorders, activation that proceeds to the terminal stages with the generation of C5b-9. The data suggest that chronic inflammation driven by in vivo complement activation may be a contributing factor to disease progression and pathogenesis in both FBD and FDD. The following peptides were synthesized at the W. M. Keck facility at Yale University and further purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC): ABri1–34 (EASNCFAIRHFENKFAVETLICSRTVKKNIIEEN), ADan1–34 (EASNCFAIRHFENKFAVETLICFNLFLNSQEKHY), ABri1–23 (EASNCFAIRHFENKFAVETLICS), ABri24–34 (RTVKKNIIEEN), ADan23–34 (FNLFLNSQEKHY), as well as full-length variants containing N-terminal pyroglutamate, oxidized cysteines at positions 5 and 22, and serine residues replacing the wild type cysteines at both positions. Peptide Aβ1–42, DEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVVGGVVIA, was used as a control in all the experiments and was synthesized at the same facility, purified, and characterized as described previously (18Matsubara E.

Pooled normal human serum (NHS), C1q-depleted serum, purified C1q protein, polyclonal goat anti-C1q antiserum, and ELISA kits for the quantitation of the activation products C4d, Bb, iC3b, and SC5b-9 were purchased from Quidel, Inc., Mountain View, CA. An EZ diagnostic kit for the assay of total complement activity (CH50) was obtained from Diamedix Corp., Miami, FL. Antibodies immunoreactive with ABri (Ab 338) and ADan (Ab 5282) molecules were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by immunization with synthetic peptides comprising positions 22–34 of the respective amyloid molecules, as previously described (12Vidal R.

Polyclonal rabbit anti-C1q was purchased from Dako (Carpenteria, CA), polyclonal anti-C5b-9 (neo-epitope), and monoclonal antibodies anti-C4d and anti-Bb were obtained from Quidel, Inc. Sequential paraffin sections from the hippocampus, including the dentate fascia were used for C1q immunostaining in five cases with FBD (mean age at death, 62.4 years; range, 59–68 years) and three cases with FDD (mean age at death, 53.7 years; range, 43–60 years). For the immunohistochemical detection of C4d, C5b-9, and Bb, sequential frozen sections, fixed in acetone, were used. Sections from four controls (mean age at death, 64.3 years; range, 33–88 years) without a neurological disease and seven cases with Alzheimer's disease (mean age at death, 78.2 years; range, 63–92 years) were also stained in a similar manner. Depending on the antibody, a number of different pretreatments were employed for the paraffin-embedded tissues, which are detailed in Table I. After pretreatment, the tissue sections were incubated with the pertinent primary antibodies, followed by sequential incubations with either biotinylated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, as appropriate, and the corresponding ABC complex (Dako, Denmark).

The different ABri and ADan peptides were solubilized in 10 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.6, aliquoted, and lyophilized. Before use, each aliquot was dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and immediately used in the complement activation assays. Aβ1–42 was dissolved in distilled water, and added of concentrated PBS to reach a final concentration of 150 mm NaCl. Solutions of 1 mg/ml were allowed to aggregate for 7 days at 37 °C, as described (19Miravalle L. Tokuda T. Chiarle R. Giaccone G. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Frangione B. Ghiso J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27110-27116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions enriched in ABri and ADan monomers were obtained via reverse-phase HPLC (Applied Biosystems, 130A Separation system) on a 0.21- × 25-cm Vydac C4 TP52 microbore column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA), using isocratic conditions at 25% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 10 min followed by a 30-min linear gradient of 25 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Fractions were collected in accordance to the absorbance at 220 nm. The degree of oligomerization of the various peptides was assessed by Western blot. Aliquots of 100–150 ng of each peptide freshly dissolved or after 1-h incubation in either PBS, pH 7.4, or Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mmCa+2, 1 mm Mg+2, 75 mmNaCl were separated in 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels and transferred for 45 min at 400 mA to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) using CAPS (3-cycloexylamino-1-propanesulfonic acid, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) buffer, pH 11, containing 10% methanol. After transference, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the corresponding primary antibody (anti-ABri, antibody 338 (1 μg/ml IgG); anti-ADan, antibody 5282 (2 μg/ml IgG)) for 3 h at room temperature followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (AmershamBiosciences, Piscataway, NJ (1:3000)). Immunoreactivity was assessed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) after developing with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The assay relies on the lysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes by human serum following activation of the Ca+2- and Mg+2-dependent classical pathway. Briefly, to induce complement activation, constant volumes (10 μl) of NHS were separately incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with 10 μl of ABri, ADan, and Aβ1–42 solutions containing increasing concentrations (0–1000 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 2 mmMgCl2 (TBS)) of the amyloid peptides. The reaction was stopped on ice and immediately analyzed for total complement activity (CH50) employing an EZ diagnostic kit in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. Results are expressed as percentage of lysis compared with controls of 100% complement activity (no complement consumption) in which NHS was incubated with buffer in the absence of amyloid peptides. NHS was incubated with identical volumes of the different amyloid peptides in increasing concentrations (0–1000 μg/ml in TBS) as described above, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a 5 mm final concentration. The generation of complement activation products was analyzed by capture-ELISA employing C4d, iC3b, Bb, and SC5b-9 kits from Quidel in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were diluted of 1:100 for the quantitation of C4d and Bb, 1:300 for iC3b, and 1:200 for SC5b-9 prior to the analysis by ELISA. To estimate the contribution of the alternative complement pathway to the total activation of the system, in a separated set of experiments and using identical conditions as above, the amyloid peptides were incubated with C1q-depleted serum (reconstituted with Ca+2and Mg+2 ions to a 10 mm final concentration) instead of NHS, and the generation of SC5b-9 was assessed by ELISA. Confirmation of the contribution of the alternative pathway to the total activation was achieved by quantitating the SC5b-9 generated by incubation of the amyloid peptides with NHS in the presence of Mg+2/EGTA. For aggregated IgG, the procedure was as follows: As a positive control for classical pathway activation in both CH50 and ELISA tests, NHS was separately added of identical volumes of aggregated IgG solutions of increasing concentrations (0–1000 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The NHS was subsequently analyzed for total remaining complement hemolytic activity (CH50) and generation of complement activation products by ELISA as described above. Aggregated IgG was prepared by incubating a 5 mg/ml solution of human polyclonal IgG (Cohn fraction II, Miles Laboratories, Inc., Kankakee, IL) at 63 °C for 15 min as described (20Salvarrey M. Rostagno A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 76: 92-96PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wener M.H. Rose N.R. Conway de Macario E. Folds J.D. Lane H.C. Nakamura R.M. Manual of Clinical Laboratory Immunolology.

Following centrifugation at 2000 ×g for 10 min, the pelleted larger aggregates were discarded, and the soluble IgG aggregates were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. The procedure for cobra venom factor was as follows: positive control for the generation of activation products by the alternative pathway consisted of NHS incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with cobra venom factor (CVF, naja naja kaouthia, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) at a ratio of 2 μg/100 μl serum (22Parker C.J. Cologan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. 3. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY1999Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by cooling on ice to 4 °C, and the serum was immediately analyzed for the presence of complement activation products by ELISA, as described above. ELISA microtiter wells were coated for 2 h at 37 °C with ABri1–34, ADan1–34, ABri1–23, and Aβ1–42 peptides at a concentration of 400 ng/0.1 ml of 0.1 mNaHCO3, pH 8.6. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, variable concentrations (0–20 nm in TBS) of C1q were incubated with the peptide-coated wells for 1 h at room temperature. Bound C1q was detected with goat polyclonal anti-C1q antiserum (1:1000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (TBST)) followed by alkaline phosphatase-labeled swine anti-goat IgG (1:5000 in TBST, BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). The reaction was developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine buffer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) stopped with 0.4m NaOH, and the absorbance at 405 nm was quantitated in a Spectracount ELISA microplate photometer (Packard, Meriden, CT). Binding data were analyzed by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The formation of the ABri/ADan·C1q complexes was assessed via amino acid sequence analysis. 10 μg of C1q in TBS was incubated with 20 μg of either ABri or ADan peptides for 1 h at 37 °C. The resulting complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels in 75 mm veronal buffer, pH 8.6, containing 2 mm sodium lactate and contact-transferred to PVDF membranes. Transferred proteins were stained for 1 min with 0.125% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 47% methanol, membranes were distained and extensively washed with water, and the bands of interest were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing on a Procise 494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Fig.1 A shows that antibody 338 specific for the C-terminal region of ABri strongly labels amyloid plaques and amyloid-laden blood vessels, including affected small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries in FBD. Both the vascular and parenchymal amyloid lesions were strongly labeled with anti-C1q (B), anti-C4d (C), anti-C5b-9 (neo-epitope) (D), and anti-Bb (E) in a staining pattern similar to that seen for ABri immunohistochemistry. Diffuse deposits, defined as Congo Red and Thioflavin S-negative or weakly positive ABri parenchymal lesions (11Holton J. Ghiso J. Lashley T. Rostagno A. Guerin C. Gibb G. Houlden H. Ayling H.

The FDD lesions, mainly vascular amyloid and parenchymal pre-amyloid plaques, were highlighted by antibody 5282 recognizing the C-terminal end of ADan (Fig. 1 F). The anti-complement antibodies (anti-C1q (G), anti-C4d (H), anti-C5b-9 (neo-epitope) (I), and anti-Bb (J)) labeled amyloid primarily deposited in small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The immunoreactivity with these antibodies was weak or absent in the parenchymal lesions, which have been shown to be composed primarily of protein in pre-amyloid conformation (Congo Red and Thioflavin S-negative or weakly positive deposits) (10Holton J. Lashley T. Ghiso J. Braendgaard H. Vidal R. Guerin C. Gibb G. Hanger D.P. Rostagno A. Anderton B. Strand C. Ayling H. Plant G. Frangione B. Bojsen-Moller M. Revesz T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of AD cases, which were used as positive controls, showed labeling of both vascular Aβ amyloid deposits and parenchymal Aβ-positive plaques by anti-C1q, anti-C4d, and anti-C5b-9 antibodies. Smaller numbers of the Aβ-positive lesions were also stained with anti-Bb antibody (not shown). Two of the normal controls were entirely negative for complement proteins, whereas in the two normal control cases with ages of 81 and 88 years, occasional Aβ-positive plaques immunoreacted only with the anti-C1q antibody (not shown). In view of the presence of complement activation products in the amyloid lesions of FBD and FDD, we investigated whether their co-localization reflected a secondary phenomenon or a specific interaction between complement proteins and the deposited peptides. As an initial step, we tested in hemolytic assays the ability of ABri and ADan peptides to activate the classical pathway. As shown in Fig.2 A, incubation of NHS with increasing concentrations of ABri1–34 and ADan1–34 resulted in a concomitant decrease in the remaining complement activity (CH50) compared with NHS incubated under the same conditions in the absence of the amyloid peptides. Under our experimental conditions, both peptides consumed complement to approximately the same extent, with remaining complement values that reached a minimum of 18% for ABri1–34 and 23% for ADan1–34 at the maximal concentration tested (final concentration: 500 μg/ml, ∼120 nmol/ml). The consumption of complement induced by the ABri and ADan peptides was also similar to that of 7-day-aggregated Aβ1–42 that, under the conditions tested, reduced the complement activity to 23% of the values obtained in the absence of peptide, in agreement with previously published data (23Rogers J. Cooper N.R. Webster S. Schultz J. McGeer P.L. Styren S.D. Civin W.H. Brachova L. Bradt B. Ward P. Lieberburg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10016-10020Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). As a positive control for the classical pathway activation, Fig. 2 A also depicts the decrease in complement activity induced by incubating NHS with aggregated IgG, a known activator of the classical pathway. As it can be deduced from the data, aggregated IgG is a more potent activator of the complement system than ABri and ADan, achieving similar levels (∼30% of the original complement activity) at a much lower molar ratio (500 μg/ml, 3.3 nmol/ml), as described (24Shen Y. Lue L.-F. Yang L.-B. Roher A. Kuo Y.-M. Strohmeyer R. Goux W.J. Lee V. johnson G.V.W. Webster S. Cooper N.R. Bradt B. Rogers J. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 305: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). No differences in activation were observed among ABri or ADan peptides bearing different post-translational modifications, i.e. N-terminal glutamate or pyroglutamate, oxidized cysteines 5 and 22, or peptides containing serine residues replacing cysteines 5 and 22 (not shown). In view of the values obtained in the CH50 hemolytic assay, we quantitated the in vitro formation of the activation products C4d, iC3b, and SC5b-9 via specific capture ELISAs employing specific monoclonal antibodies directed against neo-epitopes originated in the activation-derived fragments (8Morgan B.P.

https://openalex.org/W2056528442,"During continuous proliferation, cyclin D1 protein is induced to high levels in a Ras-dependent manner as cells progress from S phase to G2 phase. To understand the mechanism of the Ras-dependent cyclin D1 induction, cyclin D1 mRNA levels were determined by quantitative image analysis following fluorescent in situ hybridization. Although a slight increase in mRNA expression levels was detected during the S/G2 transition, this increase could not explain the more robust induction of cyclin D1 protein levels. This suggested the involvement of post-transcriptional regulation as a mechanism of cyclin D1 protein induction. To directly test this hypothesis, the cyclin D1 transcription rate was determined by run-on assays. The transcription rate of cyclin D1 stayed steady during the synchronous transition from S the G2 phase. We further demonstrated that cyclin D1 protein levels could increase during G2 phase in the absence of new mRNA synthesis. alpha-Amanitin, a transcription inhibitor, did not suppress cyclin D1 protein elevation as the cells progressed from S to G2 phase, even though the inhibitor was able to completely block cyclin D1 protein induction during reentry into the cell cycle from quiescence. The half life of cyclin D1 protein was shortest during S phase indicating that a change in protein stability might play a role in post-translational induction of cyclin D1 in G2 phase. These data indicate a fundamental difference in the regulation of cyclin D1 production during continuous cell cycle progression and re-initiation of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2081643814,"We report here that DNA polymerase β (pol β), the base excision repair polymerase, is highly expressed in human melanoma tissues, known to be associated with UV radiation exposure. To investigate the potential role of pol β in UV-induced genetic instability, we analyzed the cellular and molecular effects of excess pol β. We firstly demonstrated that mammalian cells overexpressing pol β are resistant and hypermutagenic after UV irradiation and that replicative extracts from these cells are able to catalyze complete translesion replication of a thymine-thymine cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD). By using in vitro primer extension reactions with purified pol β, we showed that CPD as well as, to a lesser extent, the thymine-thymine pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct, were bypassed. pol β mostly incorporates the correct dATP opposite the 3′-terminus of both CPD and the (6-4) photoproduct but can also misinsert dCTP at a frequency of 32 and 26%, respectively. In the case of CPD, efficient and error-prone extension of the correct dATP was found. These data support a biological role of pol β in UV lesion bypass and suggest that deregulated pol β may enhance UV-induced genetic instability.

By using in vitro primer extension reactions with purified pol β, we showed that CPD as well as, to a lesser extent, the thymine-thymine pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct, were bypassed. pol β mostly incorporates the correct dATP opposite the 3′-terminus of both CPD and the (6-4) photoproduct but can also misinsert dCTP at a frequency of 32 and 26%, respectively. In the case of CPD, efficient and error-prone extension of the correct dATP was found. These data support a biological role of pol β in UV lesion bypass and suggest that deregulated pol β may enhance UV-induced genetic instability. Exposure of cells to UV light results in the formation of a variety of lesions in their DNA, the most common being cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; (6-4)PP, (6-4) photoproduct; (6-4)TT, (6-4) photoproduct at TT site; 3′T, 3′ thymine of the UV(TT) lesion; 5′T, 5′ thymine of the UV(TT) lesion; pol, DNA polymerase; TLS, translesion synthesis; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; 6-TG, 6-thioguanine; HIV-1 RT, human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase; DTT, dithiothreitol; pol, DNA polymerase; TLS, translesion synthesis; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; 6-TG, 6-thioguanine; HIV-1 RT, human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase; DTT, dithiothreitol and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts ((6-4)PP) at adjacent pyrimidines (1Friedberg E. Walker G. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Micrbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 135-357Google Scholar). Unrepaired, these lesions can interfere with normal DNA metabolism including DNA replication, eventually resulting in mutations that lead to carcinogenesis and/or cell death. To maintain their genetic integrity, cells have evolved multiple pathways to repair various types of DNA damage, such as nucleotide excision and base excision repair pathways (1Friedberg E. Walker G. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Micrbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 135-357Google Scholar). However, all lesions on the genome cannot be repaired efficiently by these processes in time for DNA replication, and some types of lesions are repaired very inefficiently. To prevent cell death through arrested DNA replication at unrepaired lesions, cells have a mechanism, referred to as translesion synthesis, that allows DNA synthesis to proceed past lesions and employs specialized DNA polymerases for promoting continued nascent strand extension. In human cells, recent genetic and biochemical studies suggest that translesion synthesis (TLS) past a CPD-TT or a (6-4)TT lesion could be facilitated by at least four DNA polymerases, pol η, ζ, ι, and κ. In the case of pol η, this process appears to be efficient and largely accurate opposite a CPD (2Masutani C. Araki M. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Nogimori T. Maekawa T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), whereas it could be mutagenic and limited at the 3′T opposite a (6-4)TT (3Johnson R.E. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the antisense mRNA of Rev3, one of the components of pol ζ, leads to a dramatic drop in the extent of UV-induced mutagenesis (4Gibbs P.E. McGregor W.G. Maher V.M. Nisson P. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6876-6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), thereby implicating human pol ζ as having a pivotal role in error-prone translesion replication in normal cells. Indeed, pol ζ can catalyze an efficient extension of nucleotides inserted opposite the 3′T of both CPD and (6-4)TT lesions (3Johnson R.E. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 5Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Another DNA polymerase, pol κ, shows similar properties opposite the CPD (6Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1910-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the case of pol ι, thein vitro incorporation of nucleotides opposite the UV lesions and subsequent bypass can be highly error-prone, but its physiological role in TLS is still controversial (5Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 7Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R.

Presumably, all these polymerases can compete for the 3′-primer terminus at the site of a lesion, and one would predict an effect on the quantitative and qualitative mutagenesis in UV-irradiated cells expressing these enzymes differentially. For example, mutations in the POLH(XPV/RAD30A) human gene that generate a severely truncated and inactive pol η protein result in the xeroderma pigmentosum variant phenotype characterized by UV-induced hypermutability (9Maher V.M. Ouellette L.M. Curren R.D. McCormick J.J. Nature. 1976; 261: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 10McGregor W.G. Wei D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell.

The study reported here indicates that pol β can now be added to the list of enzymes that can perform unassisted UV lesion bypass. pol β is believed to function primarily in the repair of damaged bases in normal somatic cells (14Sobol R. Horton J. Kühn R. Gu H. Singhal R. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). It is a monomeric protein of 335 amino acids (39 kDa) that lacks exonuclease activities and whose enhanced expression has been demonstrated by our laboratory to result in an increased mutation frequency (15Canitrot Y. Cazaux C. Frechet M. Bouayadi K. Lesca C. Salles B. Hoffmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12586-12590Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) as well as chromosome instability and tumorigenesis (16Bergoglio V. Pillaire M. Lacroix-Tricki M. Raynaud-Messina B. Bieth A. Canitrot Y. Garès M. Wright M. Delsol G. Loeb L.A. Cazaux C. Hoffmann J.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3511-3514PubMed Google Scholar). At the transcriptional level, pol β is overexpressed in many cancer cells (17Scanlon K. Kashani-Sabet M. Miyachi H. Cancer Invest. 1989; 7: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). High levels of pol β have also been detected at the protein level in ovarian tumors (18Canitrot Y. Hoffmann J.S. Calsou P. Hayakawa H. Salles B. Cazaux C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as well as in prostate, breast, and colon cancer tissues where the enzyme amount was respectively 11-, 286-, and 22-fold higher as compared with adjacent normal tissues (19Srivastava D. Husain I. Arteaga C. Wilson S. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pol β level and activity are increased by 10-fold in blood samples from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients and in tumor biopsies from non-small cell lung tumors. 2Y. Canitrot, C. Cazaux, and J.-S. Hoffmann, unpublished data. The pol β-dependent translesion replication that we observed here differs from that of the related DNA polymerases in the efficiency as well as in the accuracy of the reaction. These data may be relevant within the tumoral cellular context where pol β is up-regulated, especially in melanomas, since several analyses showed a significant positive association between cutaneous melanoma incidence and high levels of intermittent solar exposure (20Elwood J.

Tissues from normal skin and metastasic melanoma, kindly given by Dr Voigt (ICR, Toulouse, France), were lysed. For analysis of pol β, cell lysates (70 μg of proteins) were electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (0.1% Tween) with 5% non-fat dry milk, incubated with anti-pol β monoclonal antibody (1/200, DNA polymerase β Ab-1, clone 18 S, Neomarkers, Interchim) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and revealed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Equal loading was determined using monoclonal antibody to actin (1/5000) (Chemicon, Euromedex, France). AA8 CHO cells were maintained in MEMα (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. CHO cell lines overexpressing pol β were established previously after stable transfection of pUTPolβ plasmid (15Canitrot Y. Cazaux C. Frechet M. Bouayadi K. Lesca C. Salles B. Hoffmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12586-12590Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Control cells and cells overexpressing pol β were plated in 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Next, they were irradiated with a 254-nm UV-C lamp at the fluence rate of 0.5 J/m2/s. Colonies were fixed and stained after 6 days of postincubation, and those >50 cells were scored. For the 6-thioguanine (6-TG)-resistant tests, cells were first irradiated at 20 J/m2 and then exposed to 20 μm6-TG-containing medium (106 cells/14-cm plate) to determine the number of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase mutants. After 1 week, plates were stained, and colonies of >50 cells were counted. Mutant frequencies were corrected for plating efficiency and for UV cytotoxicity. Rat pol β was purified inEscherichia coli as described (25Kumar A. Widen S. Williams K. Kedar P. Karpel R. Wilson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2124-2131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of rat pol β corresponds to 1 pmol of dNTP incorporated into acid-insoluble materials at 37 °C in 60 min by using an activated calf thymus DNA preincubated with DNase I as a substrate. Human pol β was provided by Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD) and showed a 0.68 μg/μl concentration and a 4 units/μl activity. Calf thymus pol α and HIV-1 RT were purified as described previously (26Hoffmann J.S. Fry M. Ji J. Williams K.J. Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2895-2900PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hoffmann J.S.

AA8 CHO Sh::pol β cells and AA8 CHO Sh cells were obtained after stable transfection of pUTPolβ and empty pUT687 vectors as reported previously (15Canitrot Y. Cazaux C. Frechet M. Bouayadi K. Lesca C. Salles B. Hoffmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12586-12590Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, pol β cDNA was fused in-frame with the bacterialSh::blegene conferring resistance to the broad-spectral zeocin xenobiotic of the phleomycin family. 30-mer UV-modified oligonucleotides and pBS-SV oriA/B vectors were prepared as described (28Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UV-modified 30-mer oligomers 5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTTCATCATACAGTCAGTG-3′ were chemically synthesized as described previously (29Murata T. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Iwai S. Shimizu M. Kamiya H. Ohtsuka E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7642-7643Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). They were hybridized to 5′-32P-labeled 16-mer (5′-CACTGACTGTATGATG-3′), 17-mer (5′-CACTGACTGTATGATGN-3′), or 18-mer (5′-CACTGACTGTATGATGNN-3′) primers at a molar ratio of 1:1 for 10 min at 70 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Standard 15-μl reaction mixtures contained 14 nm of the 5′-32P-labeled primer-template DNA and specific buffer as follows: pol β buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol; pol α buffer contained 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT; HIV-RT buffer contained 60 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 8.2, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl; buffer for cell extract reaction contained 45 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.4 mm EDTA, 3.4% glycerol, 65 mm mono-K-glutamic acid, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were performed at 37 °C and terminated by adding 5 μl of stopping buffer (90% formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1 mm EDTA). Samples were denaturated for 10 min at 70 °C and loaded to a 20% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gel. CHO extract preparation was performed according to the previously described protocol (31Hoffmann J. Pillaire M. Lesca C. Burnouf D. Fuchs R. Defais M. Villani G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13766-13769Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Competent replicative extracts from the melanoma cell lines were not feasible. An 11-mer unlabeled oligonucleotide (5′-ATGCTGACGAG-3′) was also used and annealed to the template at a molar ratio of 2:1 to saturate the 3′-end of the template. pBS-SvoriA(CPD) or pBS-SvoriB(CPD) plasmids were generated as described (2Masutani C. Araki M. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Nogimori T. Maekawa T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Replication reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 7 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP, 4 mm ATP, 100 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, 10 μm dGTP, 40 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma), 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), 100 ng of pBS-SvoriA(CPD) or oriB(CPD), 0.5 μg of SV40 large T-antigen (Molecular Biology Resources), and 400 μg of Hela cell extract. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, 0.012 units of rat pol β and 1 μCi of [α-32P[dATP (4000 cpm/pmol; AmershamBiosciences) were added to reaction mixtures and incubated for 1 h. Reactions were quenched by adding an equal volume of “stop solution” (2% SDS, 2 mg/ml proteinase K, and 50 mmEDTA), and further incubation was done for 1 h at 55 °C. DNA (0.5 μg of pc-DNA II, Invitrogen, containing one BamHI site and multiple DpnI sites) was added to each sample as internal purification controls. Reaction products were purified by extraction with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was resuspended in distilled water. The samples were then treated with BamHI and DpnI (New England Biolabs), and the restriction digests were separated on a 1% agarose gel. After ethidium bromide staining of the gel, internal control DNAs were quantified. The gel was then dried, and autoradiography was performed. Quantification analysis of the resolved radioactive bands on the gel was achieved by PhosphorImager Storm-system analysis using ImageQuant software. Previously, we and others found that pol β was overexpressed at the protein level in many cancer tissues as compared with normal tissues (17Scanlon K. Kashani-Sabet M. Miyachi H. Cancer Invest. 1989; 7: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Canitrot Y. Hoffmann J.S. Calsou P. Hayakawa H. Salles B. Cazaux C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Srivastava D. Husain I. Arteaga C. Wilson S. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed four independent melanoma protein extracts, and we compared their pol β content relative to normal skin tissues (Fig. 1). More than a 10-fold increase in pol β level was observed in all the melanomas tested, whereas a slight detection of the enzyme was discernible only after a long time exposure in normal skin (data not shown). In this work, we hypothesized that excess pol β in skin cells exposed to UV light may predispose these cells to initiation and/or progression into tumoral melanomas by raising the UV-induced genetic instability. To investigate whether high levels of pol β can affect genetic stability after UV irradiation in mammalian cells, we examined UV sensitivity as well as UV-induced mutagenesis in two independent transfected CHO cell lines that overproduce the enzyme by 3.2- and 2.4-fold (AA8 pol β2::Sh cells and AA8 pol β3::Sh cells) (16Bergoglio V. Pillaire M. Lacroix-Tricki M. Raynaud-Messina B. Bieth A. Canitrot Y. Garès M. Wright M. Delsol G. Loeb L.A. Cazaux C. Hoffmann J.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3511-3514PubMed Google Scholar). Firstly, we conducted clonogenic experiments after treatment with increasing doses of UV-C irradiation concomitantly with the isogenic control AA8 Sh cells. In at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate, we demonstrated a significant 1.5–2-fold resistance of cells up-regulating the enzyme as compared with the control cells (Fig.2 A). To compare the mutation frequency in the surviving irradiated cells, we used the conventional methodology testing the appearance of mutational events leading to a resistance phenotype at the locus encoding the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase. After irradiation, cells were allowed to grow for 1 week before plating in 6-thioguanine-supplemented medium and then grown for one additional week, and 6-TGR mutant colonies were counted. A 2.6–50-fold increase in mutagenesis for the pol β::Sh cells relative to the Sh cells was observed in three independent experiments after a 20 J/m2 UV dose (Fig. 2 B). The lack of correlation between pol β expression level and UV resistance as well as hypermutability may be due to the mutator phenotype induced by pol β overexpression (15Canitrot Y. Cazaux C. Frechet M. Bouayadi K. Lesca C. Salles B. Hoffmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12586-12590Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is possible that the higher expression of pol β may cause deleterious side effects and may affect other genes that would interfere with cell viability after UV treatment. To investigate the molecular bases for these in vivophenotypes, we tested a potential translesion ability of UV lesions of the replicative extracts from these cell lines. We performed in vitro primer extension reactions with a 30-mer template containing a CPD adduct, annealed to a 5′-32P-labeled 16-mer primer (Fig. 3 A, upper part). The primer was localized at a position so that the two first nucleotides were always incorporated opposite the lesion. In the presence of replicative extracts prepared from the control cells and one pol β::Sh cell line, we found that the pol β::Sh cell extracts could replicate past the CPD more efficiently as compared with the control extracts (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating that excess pol β facilitated the bypass process. Addition of purified pol β to the control extracts also increased a bypass synthesis capability of the CPD lesion (data not shown). In contrast, we did not observe any TLS of the heavy distorting (6-4)TT lesion with either cell extract (data not shown). These results suggest that bypass synthesis of CPD damage by excess pol β may contribute to the in vivo resistance and hypermutagenesis toward UV irradiation in the cells overexpressing pol β. To investigate in more depth the specific ability of pol β to bypass UV photoproducts, we performed a kinetic study on the 30-mer template containing either CPD or (6-4)TT adduct, annealed to a 5′-32P-labeled 16-mer primer (Fig.3 A). We used purified human and rat pol β, and we compared their behavior to pol α, which was reported previously as unable to incorporate nucleotides opposite the CPD or the (6-4)TT (2Masutani C. Araki M. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Nogimori T. Maekawa T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3 B, by using amounts of enzymes allowing efficient and complete primer extension on undamaged template (Fig. 3 B, right part), pol β was able to incorporate nucleotides opposite both the CPD and the (6-4)TT lesions (17- and 18-mer products) as well as to perform extension beyond the adducts (products with a size larger than 18-mer) in a time-dependent manner, whereas pol α is not, as expected. Some discrete radioactive fragments were also observed as 24-mer products; the mechanism involved in the generation of these products will be addressed in more depth later in the manuscript when describing Fig. 4. We also reported here that the HIV-1 RT, which shares structural and inaccuracy features with pol β, catalyzed efficient translesion synthesis of UV photoproducts (Fig. 3 B). To better visualize and quantify the pol β-dependent bypass process, the 30-mer template was annealed in the presence of the 16-mer-labeled primer at a ratio of 1:1 and an excess of 11-mer oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′-end of the template to generate a 3-nucleotide gapped DNA, a preferential substrate for pol β that offers the possibility to analyze the incorporation opposite the lesion and further extension of one nucleotide (Fig. 3 A). Primer extension reactions were performed in the presence of 0.05 or 0.5 units of human pol β, leading to a 1:1 or 10:1 molar ratio, respectively, as compared with the primer-template. We found a more efficient pol β-mediated bypass in both a time- and dose-dependent manner on this gapped DNA as compared with the non-gapped template (Fig. 3 C). The higher efficiency for nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesions may be favored by the ability of the pol β 8-kDa domain, which binds to the downstream 5′-terminus, to promote processive extension of misinserted nucleotides on undamaged gapped DNA (32Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the presence of 0.05 and 0.5 units of pol β, the efficiency of the bypass of CPD into the 3-nucleotide gap represented 20 and 75% extension, respectively, of the primer for 60 min of incubation time (Fig.3 C). A minor bypass product also showed full-size synthesis in the presence of higher polymerase concentration, probably resulting from the previously reported in vitro strand displacement activity by pol β of the 11-mer oligonucleotide (18Canitrot Y. Hoffmann J.S. Calsou P. Hayakawa H. Salles B. Cazaux C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the case of the (6-4)TT adduct, the presence of the 11-mer oligonucleotide allowed a 3-fold increase of nucleotide incorporation opposite the 3′T of the adduct by 0.05 units of pol β (Fig. 3 C). A complete 3-nucleotide gap-filling reaction was achieved in the presence of 0.5 units of human pol β, and bypass products represented more than 55% of the extended oligonucleotides after 20 min of incubation (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these results demonstrated that purified pol β can bypass CPD and (6-4)TT adducts during in vitro primer extension. A steady-state “single hit” gel kinetic assay (33Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) was performed using primed unmodified or UV-modified 30-mer DNA templates to quantitatively determine the specificity of nucleotide incorporation opposite the 3′T of CPD and (6-4)TT. For damaged templates, the concentration of incoming dNTP varied from 5 to 1000 μm, and incubation time was 1 h in the presence of 0.5 units of pol β. Regarding the undamaged templates, the concentration of incoming dNTP varied from 1 to 500 μm, and incubation time was 15 min in the presence of 0.001 units of pol β when using dATP and 30 min with 0.5 units of pol β when using dCTP or dGTP. All the data we obtained are summarized in TableI, and these data revealed that the dATP represented 55 and 71% of the inserted nucleotides opposite the CPD and the (6-4)TT lesions, respectively, leading to an error-free insertion. Insertion of dCTP opposite the 3′T of the lesion represented the major error-prone insertion with 32 and 26% of the inserted nucleotides opposite the CPD and the (6-4)TT lesions, respectively. Some dGTP residues can be inserted opposite the 5′T but at a lesser extent.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters of incorporation opposite the 3′T of the CPD or (6-4)TT by human Pol βAdductdNTP addedK mV maxV max/K mInsertionf incμm%/min%CPDdATP1710.280.0016455.11dCTP3760.3540.0009431.71 /1.77dGTP3720.1460.0003913.21 /4.2(6–4)TTdATP1500.570.0038070.81dCTP3710.510.0013825.71 /2.75dGTP14110.270.000193.51 /20nonedATP1832500131dCTP1135.80.05141 /252dGTP251.30.01491 /872 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, when comparing kinetic parameters, we found that the ability of pol β to insert the incorrect dGTP nucleotide opposite the 3′T of an undamaged template was only 4–16-fold higher as compared with the pol β efficiency to misinsert dATP or dCTP opposite the 3′T of the CPD or the (6-4)TT, signifying the high capacity of pol β to incorporate nucleotide opposite distorting lesions. Finally, pol β inserted dATP opposite the 3′T of the CPD or the (6-4)TT lesion with an efficiency 3500–8000 less as compared with the insertion of dATP opposite the 3′T of the undamaged template. As it could be of biological significance to determine whether the incorporated nucleotide can be extended, 17-mer primers in which each of the four bases was paired to the 3′T of each adduct were annealed to damaged templates. Extension of these primers was assayed after a 1-h reaction in the presence of 0.5 units of pol β and either all four dNTPs (200 μm) (Fig. 4 A) or a unique dNTP (Fig. 4,B and C). The most efficient extension to the full-size product of a primer annealed to the CPD-containing template occurred with the correctly paired dATP in the presence of all 4 dNTPs (Fig. 4 A). We analyzed the 5′T incorporation specificity at the AT primer and found that, although dATP was mostly incorporated, all the other dNTPs could be also incorporated with a slightly lower efficiency (Fig. 4 B). Indeed, there was a significant misincorporation of dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP opposite the 5′T of the CPD, and after dGTP incorporation, an incorporation opposite the adjacent undamaged dCTP in the template occurred, leading to a complete lesion bypass. With the GT primer in the presence of all 4 dNTPs, the obtaining of full-size product was as efficient as compared with the correctly paired AT primer (Fig. 4 A), probably initiated by dATP incorporation (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, polβ-dependent extension of CT and TT mispairs was inefficient since it was aborted after incorporation of one nucleotide (Fig. 4 A).

Here we studied the effect of cannabinoid CB1 and CB2receptor agonists on the release of NO and cell toxicity induced by the human immuno-deficiency virus-1 Tat protein (HIV-1 Tat) in rat glioma C6 cells. The CB1 and CB2 agonist WIN 55,212–2 inhibited the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and NO release caused by treatment of C6 cells with HIV-1 Tat and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). The effect of WIN 55,212–2 was uniquely due to CB1 receptors, as shown by experiments carried out with selective CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists and antagonists. CB1 receptor stimulation also inhibited HIV-1 Tat + IFN-γ-induced and NO-mediated cell toxicity. Moreover, cell treatment with HIV-1 Tat + IFN-γ induced a significant inhibition of CB1, but not CB2, receptor expression. This effect was mimicked by the NO donor GSNO, suggesting that the inhibition of CB1 expression was due to HIV-1 Tat + IFN-γ-induced NO overexpression. HIV-1 Tat + IFN-γ treatment also induced a significant inhibition of the uptake of the endocannabinoid anandamide by C6 cells with no effect on anandamide hydrolysis. These findings show that the endocannabinoid system, through the modulation of the l-arginine/NO pathway, reduces HIV-1 Tat-induced cytotoxicity, and is itself regulated by HIV-1 Tat.

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat (HIV-1 Tat)1 is a viral protein of 86 amino acids encoded by two exons, which plays a crucial role in the replication of the HIV-1 virus (1Jones K.A. Curr. Opin.

The sequence containing the first 72 amino acids, encoded by exon 1, exhibits the full trans-activating activity, whereas the exon 2-encoded 14 amino acid C-terminal sequence is important for the binding to membrane integrins (3Watson K. Edwards R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). During the initial phase of infection, large amounts of HIV-1 Tat, together with other regulatory proteins, are synthesized and released from HIV-1-infected cells (4Ensoli B. Bonaguro L. Barillari G.

In addition, HIV-1 Tat modulates the expression of many genes regulating important functions such as cell survival and growth, inflammation, and angiogenesis (2Chang H.K. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. J.

The pharmacological effects of psychoactive cannabinoids, including Δ9-tetra-hydrocannabinol, the main psychotropic component of marijuana, depend on the interaction with specific G protein-coupled receptors.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the endocannabinoid system in the control of NO release and cytotoxicity both induced by HIV-1 Tat protein in C6 cells and to assess whether this insult affects endocannabinoid action and homeostasis. Our study casts further light on the role of NO as a potential neurotoxic mediator and on the molecular basis of cannabinoid neuroprotective actions.DISCUSSIONIn this study we show that the HIV-1 Tat protein is able to induce iNOS protein expression and nitrite production in the astroglial-derived cell line, C6 (rat glioma cells), pre-incubated with IFN-γ. Our findings are in agreement with the results reported by Polazzi et al. (43Polazzi E. Levi G. Minghetti L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in rat microglial cells. Overproduction of nitrite by the activated glia may amplify an inflammatory process leading to neuronal death and, in turn, to neurodegeneration, such as in HIV-related dementia complex, frequently observed in HIV-affected patients (48Adamson D.C. Wildemann B. Sasaki M. Glass J.D. McArtur J. Christov V.I. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 1996; 274: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar).The results of our study demonstrate that HIV-1 Tat-induced iNOS protein expression and nitrite production in C6 cells were inhibited, in a concentration-dependent fashion, and to a partial extent by WIN 55,212–2, a dual CB1 and CB2receptor agonist. HIV-1 Tat-induced nitrite production was also partially inhibited by ACEA, a selective CB1 agonist, but not by JWH-015, a selective CB2 agonist. Furthermore, WIN 55,212–2-induced inhibition of both iNOS protein expression and nitrite production was reversed by SR141716A, a CB1receptor antagonist, whereas it resulted unaffected by the CB2 receptor antagonist, SR1445528. These data indicate that the inhibition of iNOS protein expression and nitrite production in C6 cells stimulated by HIV-1 Tat is selectively mediated by CB1 receptor activation.Our results support our previous suggestion (16Galve-Ropher I. Sanchez C. Cortes M.L. Gomez del Pulgar T. Izquierdo M. Guzman M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) that the inhibition by cannabinoids of iNOS protein expression and nitrite in lipopolysaccharide-treated C6 cells is selectively mediated by CB1 receptors (28Esposito G. Izzo A.A., Di Rosa M. Iuvone T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study we also observed that HIV-1 Tat was toxic to C6 cells. Previously, Gavril et al. (49Gavril E.S. Cooney R. Weeks B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 267: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that HIV-Tat protein was toxic to differentiated PC12 cells, a rat neuronal cell-line. Therefore, our results extend our knowledge of HIV-1 Tat cytotoxic effects also to a glial-derived cell-line. More importantly, we found that treatment of C6 cells with WIN 55,212–2 resulted in a potent protective action against cell death induced by HIV-1 Tat. This effect of WIN 55,212–2 appears to be selectively mediated by CB1 receptors because it was attenuated by a CB1, but not CB2, receptor selective antagonist. We suggest that stimulation of CB1receptors leads to inhibition of HIV-1 Tat-induced cytotoxicity through the inhibition of the HIV-1 Tat-induced overproduction of NO, which has been found to have a toxic action on C6 cells (50Kim H.

Neurosci. 1996; 71: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 41Rothwell N. Toulmond S. Allan S. Stroemer P. Davies C. Ruffolo R.R. Feuersteiner G.Z. Hunter A.J. Poste G. Metcalf B.W. Inflammatory Cells and Mediators in CNS Diseases. Harwood Academic Publisher, Canada1999: 471-482Google Scholar), including NO (28Esposito G. Izzo A.A., Di Rosa M. Iuvone T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it can be hypothesized that cannabinoids, by inhibiting iNOS protein expression and NO overproduction, may protect neurons from HIV-1 Tat-induced damage. Such an effect, in the long term, may eventually result in a possible beneficial effect on AIDS dementia complex.In this study we also present unprecedented evidence on the regulation of the endocannabinoid system by HIV-1 Tat. We found that HIV-1 Tat treatment of C6 cells down-regulates the CB1, but not CB2, receptor at the transcriptional level. This effect is probably related to HIV-1 Tat-induced overproduction of NO because the NO donor GSNO reduced CB1 receptor expression in C6 cells. Because we have shown here that CB1 receptor stimulation leads to an inhibition of HIV-1 Tat-induced NO release, it is possible that CB1 receptor agonists also reduce HIV-1 Tat-induced down-regulation of CB1 receptor expression. We could not test this hypothesis because long-term stimulation of CB1receptors is known to lead to their down-regulation and desensitization through several mechanisms (52Rinaldi-Carmona M., Le Duigou A. Oustric D. Barth F. Bouaboula M. Carayon P. Casellas P. Le Fur G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 1038-1047PubMed Google Scholar, 53Jin W. Brown S. Roche J.P. Hsieh C. Celver J.P. Kovoor A. Chavkin C. Mackie K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3773-3780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it would not have been easy to interpret measures of CB1 receptor expression after 24 h co-incubation of C6 cells with HIV-1 Tat and WIN 55,212–2 (or ACEA).In view of the multi-faceted neuroprotective effects exerted by the stimulation of CB1 receptors (24Mechoulam R. Spatz M. Shohami E. Sci. STKE. 2002; 129: RE5Google Scholar), in many cell lines including C6 cells (54Maccarrone M. Bari M. Lorenzon T. Bisogno T., Di Marzo V. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13484-13492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we can speculate that part of HIV-1 Tat-induced neuronal damage is due to down-regulation of a neuroprotective endocannabinoid tone. However, the possible neurotoxic effect of HIV-1 Tat-induced down-regulation of CB1receptors might be minimized by HIV-1 Tat-induced inhibition of the cellular uptake and consequent degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide by C6 cells, which was shown here for the first time. It is noteworthy that this effect of HIV-1 Tat, unlike the other effects described in this study, does not appear to be correlated to HIV-1 Tat-induced NO overproduction because NO has been found to slightly enhance, rather than inhibit, endocannabinoid cellular uptake in C6 cells (46Bisogno T. Maccarrone M., De Petrocellis L. Jarrahian A. Finazzi-Agro A. Hillard C. Di Marzo V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 52Rinaldi-Carmona M., Le Duigou A. Oustric D. Barth F. Bouaboula M. Carayon P. Casellas P. Le Fur G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 1038-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the increase of NO release by HIV-1 Tat prevented us from observing an even higher inhibitory action by HIV-1 Tat on anandamide reuptake. At any rate, even a small inhibitory effect of HIV-1 Tat on anandamide re-uptake by C6 cells is likely to result in a significant enhancement of the extracellular amounts of endocannabinoids available for CB1stimulation and, if occurring also in glial cells in vivo, might compensate in part for the down-regulation of CB1expression by HIV-1 Tat.In conclusion, here we have presented for the first time data indicating that the endocannabinoid system protects C6 glioma cells from HIV-1 Tat-induced overproduction of NO and cell damage. Moreover, here we show for the first time that HIV-1 Tat inhibits CB1receptor expression and increases the amounts of extracellular endocannabinoids, thus regulating the levels of at least two components of the endocannabinoid system. Future in vivo studies should be addressed at establishing the relevance of these findings to the pathological effects of HIV-1 infection in the central nervous system, including AIDS dementia complex.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Chang H.K. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. J. Biomed. Sci. 1995; 2: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The sequence containing the first 72 amino acids, encoded by exon 1, exhibits the full trans-activating activity, whereas the exon 2-encoded 14 amino acid C-terminal sequence is important for the binding to membrane integrins (3Watson K. Edwards R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). During the initial phase of infection, large amounts of HIV-1 Tat, together with other regulatory proteins, are synthesized and released from HIV-1-infected cells (4Ensoli B. Bonaguro L. Barillari G. Fiorelli B. Gentleman R. Morgan R.A. Wingfield P. Gallo R.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tardieu M. Hery C. Peudenier S. Boespflug O. Montagnier L. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Tat can then translocate across the cell membrane and localize in the nucleus of uninfected cells where it drives virus replication (3Watson K. Edwards R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, HIV-1 Tat modulates the expression of many genes regulating important functions such as cell survival and growth, inflammation, and angiogenesis (2Chang H.K. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. J. Biomed. Sci. 1995; 2: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Frequently HIV-1 infection is associated with brain damage (6Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Lipton S.A. Berger J.R. Levy R.M. AIDS and the Nervous System. 2nd. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1997: 59-75Google Scholar) characterized by cerebral atrophy, neuronal loss, gliosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and microglial activation (7Orsini M.J.

All these pathological changes are accompanied by severe cognitive and motor abnormalities; neurological symptoms begin with difficulty in concentration, forgetfulness, and behavioral abnormalities, collectively known as AIDS dementia complex, subsequently progressing to florid dementia, motor impairment, coma, and death (9Navia B.A. Jordan B.D. Price R.W. Ann. Neurol. 1986; 19: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar,10Price R.W. Brew B. Sidtis J. Rosenblum M. Scheck A.C. Cleary P. Science. 1988; 239: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Marijuana, a mixture of the leaves and flowering tops of Cannabis sativa, has been used for centuries by mankind to alleviate the symptoms of a wide range of health problems, including mental disorders (11Mechoulam R. Mechoulam R. Cannabinoids as Therapeutic Agents. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1986: 1-19Google Scholar). The pharmacological effects of psychoactive cannabinoids, including Δ9-tetra-hydrocannabinol, the main psychotropic component of marijuana, depend on the interaction with specific G protein-coupled receptors. Two cannabinoid receptors, named CB1 and CB2, have been so far identified (for review, see Ref. 12Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 129-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). CB1 receptors are mainly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems (13Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bonner T.I. Nature. 1990; 346: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar, 14Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4074) Google Scholar), whereas CB2 receptors have been identified in cells of the immune system (15Galiegue S. Mary S. Marchand J. Dussosoy D.

Anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide, AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) have been proposed as the endogenous ligands of cannabinoid receptors (17Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertewee R.G.

The endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system,i.e. the cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands, seems to play a role in neuroprotection, as suggested by the up-regulation of CB1 receptor expression and the elevated concentrations of endocannabinoids in some in vivo models of neurodegeneration and brain injury (21Jin K.L.

Recent findings have demonstrated that cannabinoids are able to down-regulate the production of nitric oxide (NO), a short-lived mediator produced by thel-arginine/NO pathway, in macrophages (25Coffey R.G.

In the brain, NO is produced by both the constitutive isoform of NO synthase (cNOS) found primarly in neurons (29Knowles R.G. Palacios M. Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5159-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) and astroglial cells (30Murphy S. Minor R.L., Jr. Welk G. Harrison D.G. J.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). NO produced by cNOS in picomolar amounts mediates several physiological effects in the central nervous system, such as neurotransmission (33Garthwaite J. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 60-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar,34Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5147-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas NO generated by iNOS in nanomolar amounts under pathological conditions is a cytotoxic mediator involved in several central nervous system disorders, including inflammatory, infectious, traumatic, and degenerative diseases (35Dawson V.L.

Recently, activated glial cells have also been proposed to play an active role in many neurodegenerative pathologies (37Meda L. Cassatela M.A. Szendrei G.I. Ottvos L., Jr. Baron P. Villalba M.

Izzo A.A., Di Rosa M. Iuvone T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the endocannabinoid system in the control of NO release and cytotoxicity both induced by HIV-1 Tat protein in C6 cells and to assess whether this insult affects endocannabinoid action and homeostasis. Our study casts further light on the role of NO as a potential neurotoxic mediator and on the molecular basis of cannabinoid neuroprotective actions. DISCUSSIONIn this study we show that the HIV-1 Tat protein is able to induce iNOS protein expression and nitrite production in the astroglial-derived cell line, C6 (rat glioma cells), pre-incubated with IFN-γ. Our findings are in agreement with the results reported by Polazzi et al. (43Polazzi E. Levi G. Minghetti L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in rat microglial cells. Overproduction of nitrite by the activated glia may amplify an inflammatory process leading to neuronal death and, in turn, to neurodegeneration, such as in HIV-related dementia complex, frequently observed in HIV-affected patients (48Adamson D.C. Wildemann B. Sasaki M. Glass J.D. McArtur J. Christov V.I. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 1996; 274: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar).The results of our study demonstrate that HIV-1 Tat-induced iNOS protein expression and nitrite production in C6 cells were inhibited, in a concentration-dependent fashion, and to a partial extent by WIN 55,212–2, a dual CB1 and CB2receptor agonist. HIV-1 Tat-induced nitrite production was also partially inhibited by ACEA, a selective CB1 agonist, but not by JWH-015, a selective CB2 agonist. Furthermore, WIN 55,212–2-induced inhibition of both iNOS protein expression and nitrite production was reversed by SR141716A, a CB1receptor antagonist, whereas it resulted unaffected by the CB2 receptor antagonist, SR1445528. These data indicate that the inhibition of iNOS protein expression and nitrite production in C6 cells stimulated by HIV-1 Tat is selectively mediated by CB1 receptor activation.Our results support our previous suggestion (16Galve-Ropher I. Sanchez C. Cortes M.L. Gomez del Pulgar T. Izquierdo M. Guzman M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) that the inhibition by cannabinoids of iNOS protein expression and nitrite in lipopolysaccharide-treated C6 cells is selectively mediated by CB1 receptors (28Esposito G. Izzo A.A., Di Rosa M. Iuvone T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study we also observed that HIV-1 Tat was toxic to C6 cells. Previously, Gavril et al. (49Gavril E.S. Cooney R. Weeks B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 267: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that HIV-Tat protein was toxic to differentiated PC12 cells, a rat neuronal cell-line. Therefore, our results extend our knowledge of HIV-1 Tat cytotoxic effects also to a glial-derived cell-line. More importantly, we found that treatment of C6 cells with WIN 55,212–2 resulted in a potent protective action against cell death induced by HIV-1 Tat. This effect of WIN 55,212–2 appears to be selectively mediated by CB1 receptors because it was attenuated by a CB1, but not CB2, receptor selective antagonist. We suggest that stimulation of CB1receptors leads to inhibition of HIV-1 Tat-induced cytotoxicity through the inhibition of the HIV-1 Tat-induced overproduction of NO, which has been found to have a toxic action on C6 cells (50Kim H. Kim Y.S. Kim S.Y. Suk K. Neurosci. Letts. 2001; 309: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 51Suk K. Kim S.Y. Kim H. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because, glial cell activation seems to play an important role in neurodegeneration (37Meda L. Cassatela M.A. Szendrei G.I.

Neurosci. 1996; 71: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 41Rothwell N. Toulmond S. Allan S. Stroemer P. Davies C. Ruffolo R.R. Feuersteiner G.Z. Hunter A.J. Poste G. Metcalf B.W. Inflammatory Cells and Mediators in CNS Diseases. Harwood Academic Publisher, Canada1999: 471-482Google Scholar), including NO (28Esposito G. Izzo A.A., Di Rosa M. Iuvone T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it can be hypothesized that cannabinoids, by inhibiting iNOS protein expression and NO overproduction, may protect neurons from HIV-1 Tat-induced damage. Such an effect, in the long term, may eventually result in a possible beneficial effect on AIDS dementia complex.In this study we also present unprecedented evidence on the regulation of the endocannabinoid system by HIV-1 Tat. We found that HIV-1 Tat treatment of C6 cells down-regulates the CB1, but not CB2, receptor at the transcriptional level. This effect is probably related to HIV-1 Tat-induced overproduction of NO because the NO donor GSNO reduced CB1 receptor expression in C6 cells. Because we have shown here that CB1 receptor stimulation leads to an inhibition of HIV-1 Tat-induced NO release, it is possible that CB1 receptor agonists also reduce HIV-1 Tat-induced down-regulation of CB1 receptor expression. We could not test this hypothesis because long-term stimulation of CB1receptors is known to lead to their down-regulation and desensitization through several mechanisms (52Rinaldi-Carmona M., Le Duigou A. Oustric D. Barth F. Bouaboula M. Carayon P. Casellas P. Le Fur G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 1038-1047PubMed Google Scholar, 53Jin W. Brown S. Roche J.P. Hsieh C. Celver J.P. Kovoor A. Chavkin C. Mackie K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3773-3780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it would not have been easy to interpret measures of CB1 receptor expression after 24 h co-incubation of C6 cells with HIV-1 Tat and WIN 55,212–2 (or ACEA).In view of the multi-faceted neuroprotective effects exerted by the stimulation of CB1 receptors (24Mechoulam R. Spatz M. Shohami E. Sci. STKE. 2002; 129: RE5Google Scholar), in many cell lines including C6 cells (54Maccarrone M. Bari M. Lorenzon T. Bisogno T., Di Marzo V. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13484-13492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we can speculate that part of HIV-1 Tat-induced neuronal damage is due to down-regulation of a neuroprotective endocannabinoid tone. However, the possible neurotoxic effect of HIV-1 Tat-induced down-regulation of CB1receptors might be minimized by HIV-1 Tat-induced inhibition of the cellular uptake and consequent degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide by C6 cells, which was shown here for the first time. It is noteworthy that this effect of HIV-1 Tat, unlike the other effects described in this study, does not appear to be correlated to HIV-1 Tat-induced NO overproduction because NO has been found to slightly enhance, rather than inhibit, endocannabinoid cellular uptake in C6 cells (46Bisogno T. Maccarrone M., De Petrocellis L. Jarrahian A. Finazzi-Agro A. Hillard C. Di Marzo V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1982-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 52Rinaldi-Carmona M., Le Duigou A. Oustric D. Barth F. Bouaboula M. Carayon P. Casellas P. Le Fur G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 1038-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the increase of NO release by HIV-1 Tat prevented us from observing an even higher inhibitory action by HIV-1 Tat on anandamide reuptake. At any rate, even a small inhibitory effect of HIV-1 Tat on anandamide re-uptake by C6 cells is likely to result in a significant enhancement of the extracellular amounts of endocannabinoids available for CB1stimulation and, if occurring also in glial cells in vivo, might compensate in part for the down-regulation of CB1expression by HIV-1 Tat.In conclusion, here we have presented for the first time data indicating that the endocannabinoid system protects C6 glioma cells from HIV-1 Tat-induced overproduction of NO and cell damage. Moreover, here we show for the first time that HIV-1 Tat inhibits CB1receptor expression and increases the amounts of extracellular endocannabinoids, thus regulating the levels of at least two components of the endocannabinoid system. Future in vivo studies should be addressed at establishing the relevance of these findings to the pathological effects of HIV-1 infection in the central nervous system, including AIDS dementia complex. In this study we show that the HIV-1 Tat protein is able to induce iNOS protein expression and nitrite production in the astroglial-derived cell line, C6 (rat glioma cells), pre-incubated with IFN-γ.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13484-13492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we can speculate that part of HIV-1 Tat-induced neuronal damage is due to down-regulation of a neuroprotective endocannabinoid tone. However, the possible neurotoxic effect of HIV-1 Tat-induced down-regulation of CB1receptors might be minimized by HIV-1 Tat-induced inhibition of the cellular uptake and consequent degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide by C6 cells, which was shown here for the first time. It is noteworthy that this effect of HIV-1 Tat, unlike the other effects described in this study, does not appear to be correlated to HIV-1 Tat-induced NO overproduction because NO has been found to slightly enhance, rather than inhibit, endocannabinoid cellular uptake in C6 cells (46Bisogno T.

Ther. 1998; 287: 1038-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the increase of NO release by HIV-1 Tat prevented us from observing an even higher inhibitory action by HIV-1 Tat on anandamide reuptake. At any rate, even a small inhibitory effect of HIV-1 Tat on anandamide re-uptake by C6 cells is likely to result in a significant enhancement of the extracellular amounts of endocannabinoids available for CB1stimulation and, if occurring also in glial cells in vivo, might compensate in part for the down-regulation of CB1expression by HIV-1 Tat. In conclusion, here we have presented for the first time data indicating that the endocannabinoid system protects C6 glioma cells from HIV-1 Tat-induced overproduction of NO and cell damage. Moreover, here we show for the first time that HIV-1 Tat inhibits CB1receptor expression and increases the amounts of extracellular endocannabinoids, thus regulating the levels of at least two components of the endocannabinoid system. Future in vivo studies should be addressed at establishing the relevance of these findings to the pathological effects of HIV-1 infection in the central nervous system, including AIDS dementia complex.

https://openalex.org/W2326718329,"Although Betaig-h3 gene has been suggested to modulate cell adhesion and tumor formation, its physiological functions are not well understood. Using human papillomavirus immortalized human bronchial epithelial (BEP2D) cells, we found that Betaig-h3 expression was markedly decreased in asbestos-induced tumorigenic cells. Fusion of tumorigenic and control BEP2D cells resulted in the recovery of Betaig-h3 gene expression to control level and the loss of tumorigenic phenotype. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Betaig-h3 gene in asbestos-induced tumorigenic cells inhibited cell growth in vitro, anchorage independent phenotype, as well as tumorigenicity in nude mice. Betaig-h3 gene is ubiquitously expressed in various normal human tissues, with the exception of the brain, where there is little or no expression. In contrast, there was a decrease or absence in expression of the Betaig-h3 gene in 14 human tumor cell lines of diverse histological types examined, when compared with normal human cells or tissues. The result strongly suggests that loss of Betaig-h3 expression is a frequent event in human cancer and causally related to acquisition of tumorigenic phenotype in asbestos-treated BEP2D cells."
https://openalex.org/W2327331425,"A key step in the progression of breast cancer is the conversion of cells from an estrogen-dependent to an estrogen-independent state. Yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this transition in the control of cell proliferation of breast cancer cells remain poorly understood. A potential role for Ras-related GTPases in this process was suggested by the finding that BCAR3/AND-34, a protein isolated on the basis of its ability to convert MCF-7 and ZR-75 breast cancer cell lines to estrogen independence and tamoxifen resistance, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor with the potential to activate the Ras-related Ral, R-Ras and Rap GTPases. In this study we investigated the potential contribution of these GTPases to the generation of estrogen-independence in MCF-7 cells. We found that elevated R-Ras but not Ral or Rap activity was sufficient to induce estrogen-independent proliferation of MCF-7 cells. The effect of R-Ras was dependent upon its ability to constitutively activate the AKT kinase. Interestingly, although AKT was also constitutively activated when estrogen-independent proliferation was induced by over-expression of EGF receptors, this mechanism of hormone independence did not require AKT activation. In contrast, EGF receptors did require Ral activation to induce estrogen-independent proliferation, while Ral activation was not required for estrogen-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells. These findings suggest that Ral activity takes on a significant role in controlling cell proliferation of breast cancer cells when progression to estrogen-independence is associated with over-expression of EGF receptor family members. Moreover, because R-Ras promotes hormone-independent growth in a manner distinct from EGF receptors, it may participate in the conversion of breast cancer cells to estrogen independence when over-expression of EGF receptor family members is not involved."

Depending upon the ligand, the coupling can either be positive (flunitrazepam), negative (Ro15-4513), or neutral (flumazenil). Specific amino acid determinants of benzodiazepine binding affinity and/or allosteric coupling have been identified within GABAA receptor α and γ subunits that localize the binding site at the subunit interface. Previous photolabeling studies with [3H]flunitrazepam identified a primary site of incorporation at α1His-102, whereas studies with [3H]Ro15-4513 suggested incorporation into the α1 subunit at unidentified amino acids C-terminal to α1His-102. To determine the site(s) of photoincorporation by Ro15-4513, we affinity-purified (∼200-fold) GABAAreceptor from detergent extracts of bovine cortex, photolabeled it with [3H]Ro15-4513, and identified 3H-labeled amino acids by N-terminal sequence analysis of subunit fragments generated by sequential digestions with a panel of proteases. The patterns of 3H release seen after each digestion of the labeled fragments determined the number of amino acids between the cleavage site and labeled residue, and the use of sequential proteolytic fragmentation identified patterns of cleavage sites unique to the different α subunits. Based upon this radiochemical sequence analysis, [3H]Ro15-4513 was found to selectively label the homologous tyrosines α1Tyr-210, α2Tyr-209, and α3Tyr-234, in GABAA receptors containing those subunits.

Although multiple types of GABAA receptor existin vivo differing in subunit composition, distribution, and pharmacological characteristics, each receptor is composed of homologous subunits arranged in a pentamer around a central axis that is the chloride-selective channel. Whereas the most abundant GABAA receptor in mammalian brain is made up of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits in a stoichiometry of 2:2:1 (3McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that the two agonist-binding sites in the GABAA receptor are located extracellularly at β-α subunit interfaces in a ligand-binding pocket whose residues are partially conserved between superfamily members (6Smith G.B.

Benzodiazepines are of significant therapeutic interest and are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world, used to treat anxiety and insomnia, to induce anesthesia, and to reduce seizure activity. The binding of many clinically useful benzodiazepines, such as flunitrazepam, is positively coupled to the agonist-binding sites and results in an allosteric potentiation of apparent GABA binding affinity as measured electrophysiologically. Other drugs, such as the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro15-1788 (flumazenil), can bind to the benzodiazepine site without energetic coupling to the GABA site (zero modulator or benzodiazepine antagonist), whereas for Ro15-4513, an azide analog of Ro15-1788 and the focus of this study, there is negative allosteric coupling with GABA binding (negative modulator or benzodiazepine inverse agonist) for some GABAA receptor subunit compositions (5Barnard E.A.

The benzodiazepine-binding site is homologous to the GABA-binding sites located at the β-α interfaces, with many binding site residues conserved (12Galzi J.L. Changeux J.P. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Mutational analyses allow the identification of amino acids that are important determinants of the energetics of ligand binding, but these amino acids need not be direct contributors to the ligand-binding site.Photoaffinity labeling provides an alternative experimental approach to identify amino acids in proximity to a bound ligand (reviewed in Refs.18Brunner J.

For the nicotinic ACh receptor, photoreactive agonists and antagonists have provided extensive identification of amino acids contributing to the agonist-binding sites and to the ion channel (see Refs. 20Wang D.

For the GABAAreceptor, irradiation at 254 nm results in the covalent incorporation of the agonist [3H]muscimol, with Phe-65 in the bovine α1 subunit identified as a labeled amino acid (22Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The benzodiazepine [3H]flunitrazepam photoincorporates into several α subunit isoforms (23Mohler H.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21160-21165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and α1His-102 has been identified as the primary site of photoincorporation within the α1 subunit (26Duncalfe L.L. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. Martin I.L. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9209-9214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). [3H]Ro15-4513 can also be photoincorporated into α subunits of the GABAAreceptor (10Sieghart W. Eichinger A. Richards J.G. Mohler H. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and its site(s) of incorporation was shown to be C-terminal to α1His-102 (28Duncalfe L.L. Dunn S.M.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 298: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and possibly within the transmembrane domains of the receptor (29Davies M. Dunn S.M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ro15-4513 contains a photoreactive azide that upon UV excitation forms a reactive nitrene. Therefore [3H]Ro15-4513 should photolabel amino acids in close proximity to the azide, and identification of those residues will provide a first definition of the orientation of Ro15-4513 within the benzodiazepine-binding site.In this report we identify the amino acids photolabeled by [3H]Ro15-4513 in GABAA receptors purified by affinity chromatography from detergent extracts of bovine cerebral cortex. Labeled amino acids in the α1, α2, and α3 subunits were determined by use of a protein sequencing strategy that depended upon the pattern of 3H release rather than the direct identification of GABAAreceptor subunit amino acids.DISCUSSIONThe goal of this study was to use photoaffinity labeling to identify the amino acid(s) in the benzodiazepine-binding site that is photolabeled by [3H]Ro15-4513, an imidazobenzodiazepine that contains an azide substituent that upon UV illumination will produce a reactive nitrene. Because of the defined structure of the photoreactive intermediate, identification of the amino acids labeled by [3H]Ro15-4513 will define the orientation of the ligand within the benzodiazepine-binding site. Previous studies have shown that for receptors containing the α1, α2, α3, or α5 subunits, the binding of Ro15-4513 was negatively coupled to the binding of GABA, in contrast to the positive allosteric coupling seen for flunitrazepam at those receptor subtypes or for Ro15-4513 binding to receptors containing α4 or α6 subunits (11Knoflach F. Benke D. Wang Y. Scheurer L. Lüddens H. Hamilton B.J. Carter D.B. Mohler H. Benson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1253-1261PubMed Google Scholar).[3H]Flunitrazepam has been shown to photoincorporate into α1His-102 (26Duncalfe L.L. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. Martin I.L. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9209-9214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which had been identified by mutational analyses as a major affinity determinant of benzodiazepine binding (39Wieland H.A. Luddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α1His-102 is also an important determinant of Ro15-4513 efficacy, as substitutions at that position regulate equilibrium binding affinity (40Wingrove P.B. Safo P. Wheat L. Tompson S.A. Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 437: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and determine whether it acts as a positive or negative modulator of GABA responses (41Dunn S.M.J. Davies M. Muntoni A.L. Lambert J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 768-774PubMed Google Scholar). However, the extent of overlap between the binding site for flunitrazepam and Ro15-4513 is uncertain. Photolabeling of recombinant α1β3γ2 GABAAreceptors by Ro15-4513 resulted in a 90% decrease of high affinity [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]Ro15-4513-binding sites, but after photolabeling by flunitrazepam there was a 90% reduction of flunitrazepam sites, whereas the number of [3H]Ro15-4513 sites were reduced by less than 10% (42McKernan R.M. Farrar S. Collins I. Emms F. Asuni A. Quirk K. Broughton H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although [3H]flunitrazepam is photoincorporated into α1His-102, the amino acid(s) photolabeled by [3H]Ro15-4513 are contained within a subunit fragment extending from residue 104 to the C terminus of the α1subunit (43Davies M. Martin I.L. Bateson A.N. Hadingham K.L. Whiting P.J. Dunn S.M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), possibly within amino acids 247–289 that span the end of the first transmembrane segment to the beginning of the third transmembrane segment (29Davies M. Dunn S.M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).In this report we have used a radiochemical sequencing strategy to identify the amino acids labeled by [3H]Ro15-4513 in a heterogeneous preparation of GABAA receptors purified from bovine cortex on a benzodiazepine affinity column. The purification procedure resulted in an ∼200-fold purification of a population of receptors containing, based upon immunoblot analysis, α1, α2, or α3 subunits. Based upon the level of specific [3H]muscimol binding, active GABA receptors comprise ∼1% of the protein in the preparation, and, not surprisingly, GABAA receptor subunits or subunit fragments could not be directly detected by Edman degradation when labeled subunits were isolated by SDS-PAGE or when subunit fragments were further purified by SDS-PAGE and reversed-phase HPLC. However, by use of N-terminal sequence analysis to determine the patterns of3H release as labeled subunit fragments were digested sequentially with a panel of four proteases, we established that [3H]Ro15-4513 is photoincorporated into homologous positions in the three subunits: α1Tyr-210, α2Tyr-209, and α3Tyr-234. Our results are most compelling for the α3 subunit, for which positive identification of the 3H release profile was made after digestion with 4 proteases, whereas the identification of the labeled amino acids in the α1 and α2 subunits utilized only 3 and 1 proteases, respectively. Although the subunit heterogeneity of the brain GABAA receptor preparation initially complicated the identification of the sites by making it appear that multiple sites of labeling might exist within a single subunit, the fact that our data are consistent with photoincorporation into homologous Tyr in all three subunits actually strengthens the conclusion about each individual identification.The position in the rat GABAA receptor (α1Tyr-209) occupied by the tyrosine residues photolabeled by [3H]Ro15-4513, as well as α1Thr-206, have been shown by site-directed mutagenesis to affect the affinity of ligands whose binding is coupled either positively or negatively to the GABA site (14Buhr A. Schaerer M.T. Baur R. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 44Amin J. Brooks-Kayal A. Weiss D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, α1Val-211 and the corresponding α5Ile-215 have been identified as imidazobenzodiazepine affinity determinants (45Strakhova M.I. Harvey S.C. Cook C.M. Cook J.M. Skolnick P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1434-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In a pharmacophore model of the benzodiazepine-binding site developed based upon the results of mutational analyses (46He X. Zhang C. Cook J.M. Med. Chem. Res. 2001; 10: 269-308Google Scholar), α1Tyr-209 was proposed to interact with all ligands. However, in the model it was not positioned in proximity to the azide of Ro15-4513 (or to α1His-101).The radiosequence strategy that we have used permits a positive identification of [3H]Ro15-4513-labeled amino acids in the α1, α2, and α3 subunits, but in the absence of direct identification of subunit masses by Edman degradation, our results provide no information about the relative efficiency of incorporation of [3H]Ro15-4513 into the different subunits or about the relative abundance of each subunit in our receptor preparation. It is most likely that the labeled α1, α2, and α3 subunits are each contained within distinct populations of monomeric GABAA receptors. However, further immunoaffinity purification by use of subunit-specific antibodies would allow a direct determination of whether labeled α1 and α3subunits, for example, coassemble in a single receptor. For rat cortical membranes, both α1 and α3 subunits were photolabeled with [3H]Ro15-4513, and based upon immunoaffinity purification with subunit specific antisera, a minor proportion of labeled α1 subunits copurifies with α3 subunits (47Araujo F. Tan S. Ruano D. Schoemaker H. Benavides J. Vitorica J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27902-27911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).No Evidence of [3H]Ro15-4513 Labeling of α1His-102 or Amino Acids within α197–117Previous photolabeling and mutational studies of the GABAA receptor indicate that at least 2 additional regions of an α subunit primary structure may come in contact with Ro15-4513 at the benzodiazepine-binding site, specifically residues near α1His-102 and α1Tyr-160 (7Cromer B. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 13Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). An examination of an alignment of the bovine α1–3 sequences for these regions (Fig. 9) indicated that if they were labeled, we would have seen patterns of 3H release after proteolytic fragmentation significantly different from those that we observed in our experiments. For the regions preceding α1His-102 and α1Tyr-160, all three subunits would produce the same patterns of protease cleavages, EX 19KX 4D and EX 4D X 6K, respectively. Although we have no direct proof that cleavages at these sites occurred, the efficiency of cleavages that occurred before α3Tyr-234 and the corresponding regions of the α1 and α2 subunits makes it likely that these cleavages also occur. The patterns of 3H release we observed lead us to conclude that there is no significant [3H]Ro15-4513 photoincorporation in α1His-102, in the corresponding positions in the α2 or α3 subunits, or in nearby amino acids. The 3H release patterns seen during sequence analysis of the major peak of 3H in the HPLC fractionation of EndoLys-C digests of GABAA receptor subunits (Figs. 5and 6) are also not consistent with labeling at or near α1Tyr-160, but the 3H release in the sixth cycle of Edman degradation of fractions 20 and 21 of the EndoLys-C digest (Fig. 7), which we attribute to labeling of α2Tyr-209, is also consistent with labeling of α1Tyr-162 or the corresponding position in the other subunits. However, in other experiments when the materials eluted from gel Bands 6–8 were digested with EndoAsp-N and then sequenced,3H release was limited to cycles 12 and 19 with no release in cycle 14 as would be expected for labeling of α1Tyr-162 (data not shown).A Model of the Benzodiazepine-binding SiteTo gain further appreciation of the selective labeling of α1Tyr-210 by [3H]Ro15-4513, we constructed an homology model of an extracellular domain of GABAA receptor containing 2 α1, 2 β1, and a γ2 subunits, based upon the crystal structure of the snail AChBP, a soluble, secreted protein homologous to the extracellular domain of the nicotinic ACh receptor (36Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar, 48Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig.10 is a stereo representation of the benzodiazepine-binding site within our model with Ro15-4513 docked in an energetically favored orientation. In this orientation the photoreactive nitrogen of the azide is ∼5 Å from α1Tyr-210 and 4 Å from α1His-102, the residue that is labeled by [3H] flunitrazepam, and it is also within 4–6 Å of α1Tyr-160, α1Ser-205, and γ2Phe-77. In a docking simulation with flunitrazepam (not shown), we found that it was oriented with its nitro group within 4 Å of α1His-102, consistent with one proposed mechanism of photoincorporation via a nucleophilic attack on a benzene carbon ortho to the nitrogen (49Givens R.S. Gingrich J. Mecklenburg S. Int. J. Pharm. (Amst.). 1986; 29: 67-72Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and within 5 Å of α1Tyr-210.In terms of the model, the labeling of α1Tyr-210 by [3H]Ro15-4513 and the lack of labeling of α1His-102 is very striking. This might result from the preferential reaction of the photoreactive intermediate with Tyr rather than His, as photolabeling of tyrosines by azide photoaffinity labeling has been frequently observed (19Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar), whereas labeling of His has not been reported to our knowledge. However, the labeling of α1Tyr-210 also occurs in the absence of labeling of α1Tyr-160. Alternatively, the lack of labeling of α1His-102 or α1Tyr-160 may, in fact, occur because the structure of the benzodiazepine-binding site occupied by Ro15-4513 may differ significantly from that in the homology model. Because the binding of flunitrazepam is coupled positively to the binding of GABA, whereas the binding of Ro15-4513 is coupled negatively, flunitrazepam will stabilize the same conformation of the GABAA receptor that is favored by the binding of GABA, whereas Ro15-4513 will stabilize a conformation with low affinity for GABA, presumably the resting state of the receptor. Changes of the accessibility of substituted cysteines for chemical modification have provided evidence that the binding of GABA results in a change in the structure of the benzodiazepine-binding site (50Teissere J.A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4977-4986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The homology model is based upon the structure of the AChBP in a single conformational state (36Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar), one that binds ACh with high affinity and is presumed to be closest in structure to a nicotinic ACh receptor conformation that binds ACh with high affinity, i.e. either an open channel or desensitized state. A recent comparison of the structure of the AChBP with that of the extracellular domain of theTorpedo nicotinic ACh receptor in the resting state identifies significant differences in structure within the agonist-binding site (51Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In future studies it will be important to determine whether [3H]Ro15-4513 photolabels amino acids other than α1Tyr-210 when photolabeling is carried out in the presence of GABA or another agonist. γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) 1The abbreviations used are: GABAAreceptor, GABA receptor type A; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; ACh, acetylcholine; AChBP, molluscan acetylcholine-binding protein; V8 protease, S. aureus glutamyl endopeptidase; EndoLys-C, endoproteinase Lys-C; EndoAsp-N, endoproteinase Asp-N; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography1The abbreviations used are: GABAAreceptor, GABA receptor type A; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; ACh, acetylcholine; AChBP, molluscan acetylcholine-binding protein; V8 protease, S. aureus glutamyl endopeptidase; EndoLys-C, endoproteinase Lys-C; EndoAsp-N, endoproteinase Asp-N; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatographyreceptors, the major inhibitory ligand-gated ion channels in the mammalian central nervous system, comprise a family in the Cys loop receptor superfamily of homologous ligand-gated ion channels that also includes glycine and invertebrate glutamateCl receptors with anion-selective channels and nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin 5-HT3 receptors with cation-selective channels (1Ortells M.O.

In tumor cells, MRP1 confers resistance to a broad spectrum of drugs, but in normal cells, it functions as a primary active transporter of organic anions such as leukotriene C4 and 17β-estradiol 17β-(d-glucuronide). We have previously shown that mutation of TM17-Trp1246 eliminates 17β-estradiol 17β-(d-glucuronide) transport and drug resistance conferred by MRP1 while leaving leukotriene C4 transport intact. By mutating the 11 remaining Trp residues that are in predicted TM segments of MRP1, we have now determined that five of them are also major determinants of MRP1 function. Ala substitution of three of these residues, Trp445 (TM8), Trp553 (TM10), and Trp1198 (TM16), eliminated or substantially reduced transport levels of five organic anion substrates of MRP1. In contrast, Ala substitutions of Trp361 (TM7) and Trp459(TM9) caused a more moderate and substrate-selective reduction in MRP1 function. More conservative substitutions (Tyr and Phe) of the Trp445, Trp553, and Trp1198 mutants resulted in substrate selective retention of transport in some cases (Trp445 and Trp1198) but not others (Trp553).

The specific amino acids that determine the ability of MRP1 to transport this exceptionally diverse spectrum of substrates remain largely unknown.

Both conservative and nonconservative substitutions of this amino acid eliminated E217βG transport and resistance to cationic and electroneutral natural product drugs by MRP1. E13SO4 and MTX transport and sodium arsenite resistance were also significantly reduced by substitutions of Trp1246, but LTC4 and GSH transport and antimony tartrate resistance remained essentially intact (39Ito K.

In the present study, we have extended our investigations of the functional role of Trp residues in MRP1 by determining the functional consequences of mutating the remaining 11 Trp residues predicted to be in or near the TM helices of this transporter (Fig. 1). [6,7-3H]E217βG (55 Ci mmol−1) and [glycine-2-3H]GSH (40–44.8 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [14,15,19,20-3H]LTC4 (115.3 Ci mmol−1) was from Amersham Biosciences, and [3′,5′,7′-3H]MTX sodium salt (17 Ci mmol−1) was from Moravek Inc. (Brea, CA). LTC4was purchased from Calbiochem, and nucleotides, GSH, apigenin, 2-mercaptoethanol, acivicin, E217βG, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. Trp mutations in MRP1 were generated using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The template for mutagenesis of Trp residues in MSD1 was prepared by cloning a 0.9-kb XbaI/BamHI fragment (containing nucleotides 1–841 of the MRP1 sequence encoding amino acids 1–280) from pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K into pGEM-3Z7 (Promega, Madison, WI) (39Ito K.

The template for mutagenesis of Trp residues in MSD2 was prepared by cloning a 1.9-kb BamHI/SphI fragment (containing nucleotides 841–2701 encoding amino acids 281–900) from pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K into pBluescriptSK(+)7 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) into which aSphI site had been introduced into the multiple cloning site using the following mutagenesis primer (substituted nucleotides are underlined): 5′-CGACGGTATCGATAAGCATGCTATCGAATTCCTGCAGC-3′.

Constructs encoding GFP fusion proteins of selected MRP1 Trp mutations were generated by exchanging the 1.3-kb ClaI/AflII fragment of a pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1-GFP construct with the comparable fragments containing the W445A, W553A, and W1198A mutations generated above and designated pcDNA3.1-W445A/MRP1-GFP, pcDNA3.1-W553A/MRP1-GFP, and pcDNA3.1-W1198A/MRP1-GFP, respectively (39Ito K.

Wild-type and mutant pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K expression vectors were transfected into SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). In initial experiments, ∼1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in each well of a six-well plate and 24 h later were exposed to 1 μg of DNA using FuGENEJ6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Empty vector and vector containing the wild-type MRP1 cDNA were included as controls in all experiments. Transfections were also carried out with a second independently generated clone of each mutant so that clonal variation could be excluded as an explanation for any changes in expression levels and/or transport activities observed.

Briefly, [3H]LTC4 transport assays were performed at 23 °C in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 nm substrate (40 nCi/reaction), 4 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, creatine phosphate (10 mm), creatine kinase (100 μg ml−1), and 2–4 μg of vesicle protein. Controls contained 4 mm AMP. In initial time course experiments, uptake was stopped at the indicated times and in subsequent experiments at 1 min by rapid dilution in ice-cold buffer, and then the reaction mixture was filtered through glass fiber (type A/E) filters that had been presoaked in transport buffer. Radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. All data were corrected for the amount of [3H]LTC4 that remained bound to the filter, which was usually 5–10% of the total radioactivity. Transport in the presence of AMP was subtracted from transport in the presence of ATP to determine ATP-dependent LTC4 uptake. All transport assays were carried out in triplicate, and results were expressed as mean ± S.D.). Uptake of [3H]E217βG was measured in a similar fashion except that membrane vesicles (2 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing E217βG (400 nm; 40 nCi) and components as described for LTC4 transport. Initial time courses showed that [3H]E217βG uptake was linear for 5 min, and consequently, subsequent uptake assays were stopped at 3 min. [3H]E13SO4 uptake was measured at 37 °C for 1 min in a 50-μl total reaction volume containing membrane vesicles (2 μg of protein) and 300 nm[3H]E13SO4 (100 nCi) in the presence of 3 mm GSH and the same components as described above. [3H]MTX uptake was measured as described previously with minor modifications (47Ito K. Oleschuk C.J. W"

Nuclear receptor activity is regulated by ligand-induced interactions with coactivator or corepressor molecules. From a positive hormone response element (pHRE) and in the absence of hormone, corepressors SMRT and N-CoR are bound to some nuclear receptors such as the thyroid hormone (T3Rs) and retinoic acid receptors and mediate inhibition of basal levels of transcription. Ligand binding results in dissociation of corepressors and association of coactivators, resulting in the reversal of inhibition and a net activation of transcription. However, the role of cofactors on the activity of nuclear receptors from negative HREs (nHREs) is poorly understood. Here we show that corepressor SMRT can act as a potent coactivator for T3Rα from a nHRE; N-CoR has a similar but significantly attenuated activity. Mutagenesis of residues in the hinge region of T3Rα that block binding of SMRT and N-CoR inhibits ligand-independent transcriptional activation by T3Rα from a nHRE. These mutations also abrogate SMRT-mediated increase in transcriptional activity by T3Rα at a nHRE without significantly affecting ligand-dependent activation at a pHRE. Partial protease digestion coupled to the mobility shift assay indicate differences in the conformation of T3Rα-SMRT complexes bound to a pHREversus a nHRE. These results suggest that allosteric changes resulting from binding of T3Rα to different response elements, i.e. pHREs versus nHREs, dictate whether a cofactor will function as a coactivator or a corepressor. This, in turn, greatly expands the repertoire of mechanisms used in modulating transcription without the need for expression of new regulatory molecules.

Transcriptional regulation is fundamental to the normal functioning of the cell and is achieved through positively or negatively acting transcription factors (1Sauer F. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Whereas in some cases the transcription factors that activate and repress gene expression are encoded by different genes, increasingly more transcription factors are now recognized to function both as an activator and a repressor depending on the nature of the response element that they interact with and the cellular context (1Sauer F. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Ogbourne S. Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, the details of how an activating transcription factor can become a repressor and vice versa is not well understood. One of the factors that can serve as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the response element and cellular context is the thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) 1The abbreviations used are: T3R, thyroid hormone receptor; pHRE, positive hormone response element; nHRE, negative hormone response element; SMRT, silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors; N-CoR, nuclear receptor corepressor; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; LUC, luciferase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; MHC, myosin heavy chain; LTR, long terminal repeat; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin) (3Sap J.

Recent studies have begun to uncover the molecular details of this bimodal activity on a positive hormone response element (pHRE). In the absence of hormone, T3R associates with corepressor molecules, such as SMRT and N-CoR (7Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 8Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 9Horlein A.J. Naar A.M.

This is likely to be due the activity of histone deacetylases, which are recruited to this complex. In the presence of ligand, this corepressor complex dissociates and is replaced by a coactivator complex that then activates transcription at the promoter, which is probably because of the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases (5McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 6Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, at the negative HREs (nHREs), activation of transcription occurs in the absence of ligand (e.g. 10), when T3R is expected to be in a complex with corepressors and coactivators are not expected to be recruited to the promoter. This is therefore a paradoxical situation. It has recently been suggested that corepressors may be involved in activating transcription of genes that are negatively regulated by thyroid hormone, but the exact mechanisms involved remain to be identified (11Tagami T.

To gain insight into the molecular details of transcriptional activation at a nHRE, we have compared the contribution of corepressors to the activities of T3Rα from pHREs and nHREs. We found that interaction of corepressor SMRT with T3Rα is essential for transcriptional activation at the RSV nHRE (10Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the interaction of SMRT with T3Rα on a pHRE is topologically different from SMRT-T3Rα interactions on a nHRE, which may account for these differential effects. HeLa and CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and glutamine. The calcium phosphate coprecipitation method was used to transfect HeLa cells with 0.25 μg of reporter plasmid, 50–125 ng of expression vector, and pUC18 to a total of 1 μg of DNA/well in a 12-well dish. After 5–8 h of incubation with the precipitates, cells were shocked with 10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of T3, (10−7m). For CV-1 cells, the same procedure was followed except that the glycerol shock was not performed. Luciferase (LUC) enzyme activities were determined as described previously (10Saatcioglu F. Deng T.

For the generation of the mutant T3Rα constructs, single-stranded mutagenic primers were synthesized corresponding to the amino acids centered around the BstEII site in the hinge region of T3Rα. 2Sequences are available upon request. These primers and a primer corresponding to the SV40 polyadenylation sequence (residues 1109–1130 in pSG5) were used in PCR with pSG5-T3Rα as the template, and the amplified fragments were digested withBstEII and BamHI and exchanged with the corresponding fragment of pSG5-T3Rα. All mutants were confirmed by sequencing. For the generation of the GST-SMRT-(914–1495), pGEX-KG-TRAC2 (7Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was cut with XbaI and NotI, filled in with Klenow polymerase, and religated. To generate GST-N-CoR-(1873–2453), pCEP-N-CoR (9Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) was cut withNotI and BglII (partial), and the fragment was inserted into the BamHI and NotI sites of pGEX4TI (Promega). The production and purification of the GST fusion proteins and the in vitro interactions between T3Rα and SMRT or N-CoR were examined by the GST pull-down assay as described previously (7Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Preparation of recombinant T3Rα and the conditions for the mobility shift analyses were essentially as described previously with minor modifications (10Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant T3Rα (25 and 105 ng for the MHC- and RSV-T3REs, respectively) was incubated with GST-SMRT-(914–1495) (100 ng) for 10 min at room temperature to allow heterodimer formation. The probes and rest of the DNA binding mix were then added (0.3 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mmKCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2) and the reactions were continued at room temperature for 10 min. Increasing amounts of the indicated protease were then added, and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for an additional 5 or 10 min for chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase Y, respectively, followed by immediate loading on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were dried, and bands were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (AmershamBiosciences). to facilitate comparison, the RSV-T3RE portion of the gels were exposed longer to give an intensity of bands approximately similar to those of the MHC-T3RE portion. 125I-T3 binding assays were performed on the in vitro translated wild-type and mutant receptors as described (16Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. Lau K.H. West B.L. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The wild-type T3Rα and mutant receptors translated in vitro using the TNT expression system (Promega) were used in the T3 binding assay, andK d values were calculated using the Prism computer program (GraphPad Software, Inc.). To assess the potential contribution of SMRT and N-CoR to activation of transcription from a nHRE, we studied the activities of T3Rα from a well characterized nHRE found in the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (LTR), termed RSV-T3RE (10Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if SMRT and/or N-CoR had a role in ligand-independent activation from the RSV-T3RE, mutations that block T3Rα-SMRT or T3Rα-N-CoR interactions should abrogate this activity. To that end, we generated point mutations within the hinge region of T3Rα based on previous mutational studies with T3Rβ and N-CoR that have established the residues important for this interaction (9Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). We targeted two residues that are conserved between T3Rα and T3Rβ within this region, Ala-174 and His-175, which were changed either to an acidic (M13), an acidic and a nonpolar (M15), a small hydrophobic and a nonpolar (M17), or two small nonpolar residues (M18) (Fig.1 A). For M19 and M20, we also substituted an additional residue, Thr-178, with a small hydrophobic residue, to generate triple mutants similar to those used previously in studying T3Rβ and N-CoR interactions (9Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Because all known activities of T3Rα are modulated by hormone binding, we first examined the ability of the mutant receptors to bind T3. Scatchard analysis showed that the dissociation constants of the mutant receptors were in the range of 0.20 to 8.5 nm, as compared with 0.02 nm for the wild-type T3Rα. All mutant receptors are expected to be saturated with hormone in the experiments described below since an ∼12-fold excess of T3 (100 nm) over the K d of the weakest binder was used. Therefore, a deficiency in hormone binding is unlikely to account for the differential activities of the mutant receptors. We then tested the mutant proteins for their ability to activate transcription from a pHRE. HeLa cells were cotransfected with the MHC-CAT reporter, which contains two copies of the MHC T3RE (17Lehmann J.M. Zhang X.K. Graupner G. Lee M.O. Hermann T. Hoffmann B. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7698-7707Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected either with an empty expression vector or with expression vectors specifying wild-type T3Rα or the various mutants. After transfection, the cells were either left untreated or treated with T3 for 18 h, and CAT activities were determined. As shown in Fig. 1 B, wild-type T3Rα activated MHC-CAT expression 10-fold in the presence of T3. All of the mutants also activated 2XT3RE-LUC (14Glass C.K. Lipkin S.M. Devary O.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), which contains two consensus T3REs, ranging between 45 and 70% activity compared with wild-type T3Rα. These results suggest that all mutants are functional for transactivation from a pHRE, bind hormone, and are expressed at levels similar to wild-type T3Rα. To determine whether the mutant receptors are altered in their ability to interact with SMRT and N-CoR, we performed glutathioneS-transferase (GST) pull-down experiments. The receptor interaction domain (RID) of SMRT (8Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) was expressed as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli (GST-SMRT-(914–1495)), purified, and used in the GST pull-down assay with cell-free translated, 35S-labeled wild-type T3Rα or its mutants in the presence or absence of T3. As shown in Fig.2 A, although there was no significant interaction with GST alone, wild-type T3Rα displayed significant binding to GST-SMRT(914–1495) in the absence of T3, which was lost in the presence of T3. In contrast, all of the mutants exhibited a significantly compromised ability to bind SMRT either in the presence or absence of T3. An essentially identical pattern of interaction of the T3Rα mutants with N-CoR was observed in a similar GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2 B). To assess whether the mutations that disrupt the interaction of SMRT with T3Rα have a role in ligand-independent activation from a nHRE, we performed transient transfection experiments. HeLa cells were first cotransfected with RSV180LUC (10Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which contains the RSV-T3RE in the RSV-LTR driving expression of LUC, and either an empty expression vector or an expression vector specifying wild-type T3Rα or one of the mutants. As shown in Fig.3 A, whereas wild-type T3Rα efficiently activated RSV180LUC in the absence of T3 that was relieved in the presence of T3, none of the mutants significantly activated RSV180LUC in the presence or absence of T3. The mutants having lost their ability to bind SMRT in vitrosuggested that corepressor interactions may be involved in ligand-independent activation by T3Rα from a nHRE and prompted us to determine whether SMRT could serve as a coactivator for T3Rα in this context. To that end, the same transient transfection assay as described above was performed in the presence of an expression vector encoding SMRT. Coexpression of T3Rα and SMRT gave rise to ∼5-fold greater activation of RSV180LUC expression when compared with expression of T3Rα alone. SMRT coexpression did not significantly affect ligand-induced relief of RSV180LUC activation as it was relieved back to basal levels or lower in the presence of T3. On the other hand, the mutant receptors did not show any significant activity in response to SMRT coexpression, even at higher levels of SMRT expression (Fig. 3 A, and data not shown). This finding is consistent with the significantly diminishedin vitro interactions between the T3Rα mutants and SMRT in the GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2 A). These data suggest that SMRT serves as a coactivator for T3Rα from a nHRE. In a similar series of experiments, we tested the possible effect of N-CoR coexpression on ligand-independent activity of T3Rα from the RSV180LUC reporter. N-CoR coexpression with T3Rα resulted in a modest increase of RSV180LUC expression that was less than 2-fold compared with the levels achieved in the presence of T3Rα alone (Fig. 3 B). We did not find any more significant increase in stimulation of T3Rα activity from RSV180LUC at a wide range of lower or higher levels of N-CoR coexpression (data not shown). These results suggest that N-CoR has only a modest effect on the activity of T3Rα on a nHRE in vivo. One possible explanation for how SMRT can act as a corepressor for T3Rα from a pHRE and a coactivator from a nHRE is that the complexes formed on these two response elements have different conformations, resulting in different contributions to the transcriptional initiation complex. To assess this possibility, we used a combination of the mobility shift and partial protease digestion assays with a pHRE (MHC-T3RE) compared with a nHRE (RSV-T3RE). When recombinant T3Rα expressed in E. coli was used in the mobility shift assay, a major shifted band corresponding to the T3Rα homodimers was formed with both probes (Fig. 4; also see Refs.10Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 15Saatcioglu F. Bartunek P. Deng T. Zenke M. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3675-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, and 18Saatcioglu F. Lopez G. West B.L. Zandi E. Feng W. Lu H. Esmaili A. Apriletti J.W. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4687-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When GST-SMRT-(914–1495) was included in the binding reaction, an additional band migrating more slowly was formed corresponding to T3Rα-SMRT complexes. GST-SMRT-(914–1495) alone did not bind either probe (data now shown). Both T3Rα homodimers and T3Rα-SMRT complexes were specific as shown by competition studies, and they contained T3Rα as indicated by supershift analysis (Refs.10Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 15Saatcioglu F. Bartunek P. Deng T. Zenke M. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4687-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and data not shown). To assess whether there are conformational differences between the heterodimers formed on the two T3REs, the mobility shift binding reactions were carried out first to allow heterodimeric complex formation on DNA; these were then subjected to partial proteolysis with increasing amounts of either carboxypeptidase Y (CarbY, Fig.4 A) or chymotrypsin (Chy, Fig. 4 B). As shown in Fig. 4 A, increasing amounts of carboxypeptidase Y quickly converted the T3Rα-SMRT complex into a form that migrated faster, running just above the migration point of the T3Rα-T3Rα homodimers on both response elements (compare lane 2 withlanes 5–7). However, the faster migrating band formed on the MHC-T3RE at higher concentrations of carboxypeptidase Y was resistant to further digestion; this band is also wide, indicating the presence of more than one polypeptide complex bound to DNA. In contrast, the band formed upon carboxypeptidase Y digestion on the RSV-T3RE is a sharp, single-species band in which mobility is clearly increased in a stepwise fashion as the amount of enzyme is increased (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 5–7 for the two T3REs). Similar results were obtained when the experiment was repeated with chymotrypsin. The addition of increasing amounts of chymotrypsin to the binding reaction resulted in an increase in the mobility of the T3Rα-SMRT complex for both probes (Fig. 4 B). However there were differences in the pattern of bands generated and their rate of appearance. With increasing amounts of chymotrypsin, a band that migrated faster than the T3Rα homodimers was formed that was more resistant to digestion on the RSV-T3RE compared with the MHC-T3RE (Fig.4 B, compare lanes 5–7 between the two panels,lower arrow). In addition, this band was wide for the MHC-T3RE, as opposed to a tight, single-species band on the RSV-T3RE, indicating the presence of multiple polypeptides in the complex formed with the MHC-T3RE. Limited protease digestion of the homodimers alone under the same conditions gave rise to different, faster migrating bands compared with the experiments described above, indicating that the bands appearing upon proteolysis in the experiments presented in Fig. 4 are primarily the products of the T3Rα-SMRT complex (data not shown). We have studied the possible role of the corepressors SMRT and N-CoR on transcriptional activation by T3Rα from a well characterized nT3RE in the RSV promoter (10Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our results indicate a direct role of the corepressor SMRT in transcriptional activation by T3Rα from a nHRE, whereas N-CoR had a significantly attenuated effect. At present, the basis for the differences between SMRT and N-CoR on regulating T3Rα action from a nHRE are not clear. This paradoxical finding can be explained by the different conformations that SMRT assumes on a pHRE (exemplified by the MHC-T3RE in this study) compared with a nHRE (the RSV-T3RE). This is indicated by the fact that the sensitivity of the T3Rα-SMRT complex to proteases is different depending on the response element on which it is formed. This is expected to differentially affect the proteins recruited to the promoters, thus giving rise to diametrically opposite transcriptional outcomes. This hypothesis is depicted schematically in Fig.5. In the absence of hormone, when the T3Rα-SMRT complex is bound to the MHC-T3RE, it assumes a different conformation than when bound to the RSV-T3RE. This, in turn, results in the recruitment of a different collection of polypeptides to the complex, one that activates the transcriptional initiation complex, and the other that represses it. Recent reports suggested that a putative splicing variant of N-CoR, N-CoR-I (19Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which lacks the N-terminal repressor domain, can act as an activator for the mouse preprothyrotropin-releasing hormone gene (TRH) (13Satoh T. Monden T. Ishizuka T. Mitsuhashi T. Yamada M. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 154: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which is known to be negatively regulated by thyroid hormone. N-CoR-I also inhibits the ligand-independent repression by T3R at pHREs, presumably through competition with the endogenous N-CoR and SMRT that are involved in this process (27). In addition, N-CoR and SMRT are involved in basal activation of the promoters that are negatively regulated by thyroid hormone (11Tagami T. Madison L.D. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Tagami T. Park Y. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22345-22353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This finding was suggested to be due to protein-protein interactions involving a non-DNA bound T3Rα, allowing the association of coactivators with the DNA-bound transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) at the TSH promoter in the absence of hormone; the coactivator is removed from the DNA by a hormone-activated T3Rα, resulting in repression (12Tagami T. Park Y. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22345-22353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The findings we have presented here suggest that the effect of SMRT on T3Rα activity on a nHRE is direct and that DNA binding by T3Rα is required for these activities. Indeed, whereas the nHREs on the TSH promoter are poorly defined and therefore the negative effects of T3Rα action in the presence of hormone are likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions, as suggested previously (12Tagami T. Park Y. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22345-22353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the RSV-T3RE that is used in our studies is well characterized and is essential for this activity (7Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using an artificial construct in which the RSV-T3RE is fused to a minimal promoter driving expression of the LUC gene, similar affects of SMRT on potentiation of T3Rα action is observed. 3H. Berghagen, K. Krogsrud, and Fahri Saatcioglu, unpublished results.Taken together, these findings suggest that there may be two distinct mechanisms by which a corepressor may mediate transcriptional activation by T3Rα at a negatively regulated promoter, dictated by the nature of the cis elements present. One mechanism involves the removal of the corepressors from DNA by the receptor, and the other involves recruitment of the corepressors to the DNA and assembly of a coactivating complex. Future work will be needed to define the components of these complexes and how they activate transcription. It has recently been shown that coactivators of the nuclear receptor superfamily to which T3Rα belongs either recruit or are themselves histone acetyltransferases; conversely, the corepressors recruit histone deacetylases (for reviews, see Refs. 5McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar and 6Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that changes in histone acetylation and subsequent effects on chromatin structure may be the mechanism through which cofactors mediate regulation of transcription (for reviews, see Refs.20Shibata H.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). It will now be important to determine what the differences are in the complexes that are formed by T3Rα and SMRT on the pHREversus the nHRE in the absence of hormone and whether they contain histone acetyltransferases or histone deacetylases. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which a corepressor is shown to function as a coactivator that is dependent on DNA binding by its transcription factor. The role of the allosteric effects of DNA on the transcription factors that bind to it has been recognized for some time (for a review, see Ref. 24Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The findings we report here extend the importance of these allosteric effects by demonstrating that even the cofactors that bind to the transcription factor will be affected, such that they can function in a diametrically opposite fashion when tethered to transcription factors bound to different response elements. The fact that a cofactor previously identified as a corepressor can also function as a coactivator in another context through these allosteric effects greatly increases the repertoire of responses that the cell can mount to various signals without additional gene activation or protein synthesis.

PS is implicated in γ-cleavage of βAPP, the final step in the generation of Aβ peptides, as well as in the γ-cleavage-like intramembranous proteolysis of various transmembrane proteins (e.g. Notch, ErbB4, E-cadherin, and LRP) (reviewed in Ref.6Fortini M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of PS in the intramembranous proteolysis still remains unknown, following lines of evidence suggest that PS is a catalytic component of γ-secretase. First, the ablation of PS genes in mice inactivated the total γ-secretase activities (7Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Second, mutating either of the two conserved aspartate residues within the transmembrane domains (TMD) 6 and 7 of PS inhibited the γ-secretase activities (9Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Third, the γ-secretase activity solubilized by a mild detergent, CHAPSO, was immunoprecipitated by antibodies against PS1 in HMW fractions (10Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Lastly, the transition-state analogue γ-secretase inhibitors that are conjugated with photoaffinity labeling and/or biotin tags directly labeled the PS fragments (11Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q.

Recently, functional γ-secretase complex containing PS fragments was partially purified by an immobilized γ-secretase inhibitor (14Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is strongly suggested that the stabilized HMW complex of PS represents the functional form of γ-secretase and that the PS fragments harbor the catalytic center of γ-secretase. PS is an evolutionarily conserved protein that is present in every multicellular organism including vertebrates and invertebrates as well as plants, and the primary amino acid sequences of the C-terminal region of PS are highly conserved (15Tomita T. Watabiki T. Takikawa R. Morohashi Y. Takasugi N. Kopan R. De Strooper B. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33273-33281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that stabilization and formation of the HMW PS complex that are dependent on the integrity of the PS C terminus is required for the γ-secretase activity (16Tomita T.

Missense mutations that replace the 1st proline of the C-terminal PALP motif, which is completely conserved in all PS family members, with leucine, lead to a loss-of-function of PS inDrosophila melanogaster presenilin (Psn) as well as in Caenorhabditis elegans Spe-4 (17Arduengo P.M.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8435-8442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover,PsnB3 allele, another loss-of-function mutant ofPsn, that results in an amino acid substitution (G516E) in the C terminus of Psn has been reported (19Lukinova N.I. Roussakova V.V. Fortini M.E. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1789-1797PubMed Google Scholar). This glycine residue also is conserved in almost all known PS family members except for the C. elegans Hop-1 protein. We have previously shown that the 1st proline of the PALP motif is required for the stabilization, complex formation, and γ-secretase activities of human PS in mammalian cells (15Tomita T. Watabiki T. Takikawa R. Morohashi Y. Takasugi N. Kopan R. De Strooper B. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33273-33281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the effects of the loss-of-function mutations (P507L or G516E) on the metabolism and complex formation of Psn polypeptides still remain unknown. In this study, we examined the modes of processing, complex formation, and function of Psn protein in Drosophila S2 cells as well as in mammalian cells and compared them with those of human PS.

All constructs were sequenced using Thermosequenase (Amersham Biosciences) on an automated sequencer (Li-Cor, Lincolin, NE). cDNAs encoding mouse NotchΔE in pCS2+MT vector and βAPP695 carrying a Swedish mutation (βAPPNL) in pCEP4 (Invitrogen) have been described previously (23Iwata H.

Mouse neuro2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cells and SV40-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from PS1−/−PS2−/− littermates (provided by Dr. B.

Generation of stable N2a cell lines co-expressing βAPPNLand NotchΔE (NL/N) were described previously (25Tomita T. Katayama R. Takikawa R. Iwatsubo T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Stable N2a NL/N cell lines expressing Psn or PS2 derivatives were generated by transfecting cDNAs using LipofectAMINE and selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing both hygromycin (Wako) at 250 μg/ml and G418 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) at 500 μg/ml. Transient transfection of cDNAs into MEF cells were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of transfection, 10 mmbutyric acid was added for 24 h to drive protein expression. Drosophila Schneider (S2) cells were maintained in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% peptone, and penicillin/streptomycin (S2 medium) at 24 °C (26Hirasaka S. Kanuka H. Shoji S. Yoshikawa S. Okano H. Miura M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 667-673PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection of cDNAs into S2 cells was performed using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and samples were collected after 48 h of transfection. Stable S2 cell lines were generated by transfection of cDNAs in pAc5.1/V5-His A vector together with those in pCoHygro (Invitrogen) vector (ratio of transfected cDNAs; 2:0.1 μg) using Cellfectin and selection in S2 medium containing hygromycin at 250 μg/ml. For the production of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), transcription templates that contained T7 RNA promoter sequences on each end were generated by PCR using the following oligonucleotides containing the T7 RNA polymerase binding site as primer pairs: 5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGGCTGCTGTCAAT-3′ for Psn, 5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3′ for EGFP as sense primers, 5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAGACATCATTCCGACC-3′ for Psn, 5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGATTACTTGTACAGCTC-3′ for EGFP as reverse primers, respectively. dsRNAs were prepared from transcription templates by using MEGAscript T7 KIT (Ambion, Austin, TX) and transfected into S2 cells using Cellfectin. Cell lysates and conditioned media were harvested after incubation for indicated times.

BAN50 is a monoclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide of human Aβ1–16; it preferentially reacts with the N-terminal portion of human Aβ starting at Asp-1, but does not cross-react with N-terminally truncated Aβ nor with rodent-type Aβ (20Tomita T.

Drosophila presenilin (Psn) gene encodes 508–541 amino acid proteins with ∼50% identity to its vertebrate counterparts (21Boulianne G.L. Livne-Bar I. Humphreys J.M. Liang Y. Lin C. Rogaev E. St. George-Hyslop P. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The occurrence of endoproteolytic cleavage of Psn protein in vivo and in theDrosophila S2 cell line has also been documented, although a detailed analysis on the metabolism of Psn polypeptides is yet to be performed (18Guo Y. Livne-Bar I. Zhou L. Boulianne G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8435-8442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nowotny P. Gorski S.M. Han S.W. Philips K. Ray W.J. Nowotny V. Jones C.J. Clark R.F. Cagan R.L. Goate A.M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To examine the expression and metabolism of endogenous and transfected Psn proteins in S2 or mouse N2a cell lines, we stably transfected these cells with Psn and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the N terminus or hydrophilic 6th loop of Psn (i.e. anti-GDN1 and anti-GDL1, respectively). Immunoblot analysis of lysates of untransfected S2 cells revealed a ∼27-kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) as well as a ∼32-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) (Fig.2 A). These bands disappeared when the blots were probed by antibodies preadsorbed with immunogen proteins (data not shown). A faint band of ∼55–60 kDa, corresponding to the full-length Psn protein, also was detectable. These results confirmed the previous reports on the endoproteolysis of Psn as well as the predominance of fragment forms as endogenous Psn, which was similar to those seen with mammalian PS (18Guo Y. Livne-Bar I. Zhou L. Boulianne G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8435-8442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nowotny P. Gorski S.M. Han S.W. Philips K. Ray W.J. Nowotny V. Jones C.J. Clark R.F. Cagan R.L. Goate A.M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We next analyzed the lysates of S2 cells stably transfected with Psn (Fig. 2 A). A ∼55-kDa band corresponding to a FL Psn polypeptide was detected by the N- and C-terminal antibodies, whereas the levels of NTF and CTF did not increase, suggesting that the levels of Psn fragments also are regulated by a “limiting co-factor” in a similar manner to mammalian PS (31Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To further characterize the metabolism and function of Psn, we stably transfected the Psn cDNA into a mouse N2a cell line stably expressing both βAPPNLand NotchΔE (N2a NL/N cell line) (Fig. 2 A). Immunoblot analysis revealed that Psn polypeptides expressed in N2a NL/N cells underwent endoproteolysis to give rise to NTF and CTF of the same molecular weights as the endogenous ones in S2 cells. Moreover, the overexpression of Psn in N2a NL/N cells compromised the accumulation of endogenous murine PS fragments, suggesting that Psn retains the capacity to replace the endogenous PS by competing for limiting cofactor(s) in a similar fashion to that observed with mammalian PS (Fig. 2 B). Fragments of mammalian PS are highly stabilized and incorporated into HMW protein complexes of ∼200–600 kDa that are distributed in the ER as well as in Golgi/TGN, whereas holoproteins are rapidly degraded, fractionated in the low molecular weight (LMW) range of ∼100–200 kDa, and exclusively distributed in ER (15Tomita T. Watabiki T. Takikawa R. Morohashi Y. Takasugi N. Kopan R. De Strooper B. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33273-33281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To examine the stability of Psn protein, we treated S2 or N2a NL/N cells stably expressing Psn with cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig.3 A). The levels of endoproteolytic fragments of Psn did not decrease during CHX treatment of 10–12 h, whereas the Psn holoproteins were rapidly degraded similarly to mammalian PS holoproteins. To examine the capacity of Psn proteins to form HMW complexes, we solubilized the membrane fractions of S2 or N2a NL/N cells in 1% CHAPSO, and separated the extracted proteins on a linear glycerol velocity gradient (Fig. 3 B). Endoproteolytic fragments derived from Psn were predominantly distributed in the HMW range of 232–443 kDa, whereas Psn holoproteins were fractionated in the LMW range of 140–232 kDa. Moreover, subcellular fractionation studies using discontinuous Iodixanol gradients showed that endoproteolytic Psn fragments were recovered in fractions containing ER vesicles as well as Golgi membranes, whereas holoproteins were detected in ER fractions in N2a NL/N cells (Fig.3 C and data not shown). These data suggest that Psn proteins are metabolized in Drosophila S2 cells by a similar cellular machinery to that working in mammalian cells, and appropriately metabolized by a mammalian PS-metabolic pathway (i.e.properly folded, assembled with binding partners, stabilized, and forming HMW complex) in mouse N2a cells. The formation of the stabilized HMW complex of mammalian PS, that requires the integrity of the conserved PS C terminus, is essential to the acquisition of γ-secretase activity, and an aspartate residue within 7th TMD (TMD7) is crucial to the γ-secretase activity in mammalian PS (9Wolfe M.S.

To verify the effects of missense mutations in Psn that cause Notch (i.e. loss-of-function) phenotype in Drosophila in vivo, on the metabolism of Psn polypeptides, we introduced the two types of amino acid substitutions (i.e. P507L or G516E) and stably expressed the mutant Psn in N2a NL/N cells. In addition, we established N2a NL/N cells stably coexpressing Psn carrying D461A mutation that replaces the highly conserved aspartate residue in the TMD7 with alanine, to see if it works as a dominant negative mutant on γ-cleavage as in mammalian PS (9Wolfe M.S.

Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates showed that neither Psn/P507L, Psn/G516E nor Psn/D461A underwent endoproteolysis to give rise to NTF and CTF that normally occurs with wild type Psn (Fig.4 A). The replacement of endogenous PS1 did not occur in N2a NL/N cells coexpressing Psn/P507L or Psn/G516E. Upon CHX treatment of the N2a cells, the Psn/P507L or Psn/G516E holoproteins were rapidly degraded in a similar manner to wild type Psn holoprotein (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). In contrast, the overexpression of Psn/D461A resulted in a complete replacement of endogenous murine PS1 fragments, and a portion of Psn/D461A was stabilized as a holoprotein, as previously described in aspartate mutants of mammalian PS (i.e. PS1/D385A, PS2/D366A) (9Wolfe M.S.

https://openalex.org/W2318545273,"Allelic loss of the long arm of chromosome 11 is frequent in neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of different organs. However, the MEN1 gene on 11q13 is mutated only in a subset of NET and allelic losses on 11q frequently extend to the telomere. In this genetic region lies the tumor suppressor gene SDHD which is associated with hereditary paragangliomas (PGL1). We sought to determine whether SDHD plays a role in the development of sporadic NET. By mutation and deletion analysis of SDHD we were unable to detect any SDHD mutation in 45 NET of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas or parathyroid. However, we found allelic deletions in 20 to 50% of all tumors but parathyroid adenomas. Furthermore, we found heterozygous germline variants in 2/8 paragangliomas. A first case of variant c.149 A>G (H50R) was found in a patient with an extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma, the other variant c.34 G>A (G12S) in a patient with a paratracheal paraganglioma, C-cell hyperplasia of the thyroid and hyperplasia of ACTH-producing cells of the pituitary gland. Both variants were absent in 93 controls. Our results demonstrate that somatic SDHD mutations are rare in sporadic NET. However, LOH alone could lead to a complete loss of function since SDHD is an imprinted gene. Furthermore, we describe two germline variants possibly causing hereditary paragangliomas."

https://openalex.org/W2327587424,"In the present study, we investigate the mechanism of how p53 induces growth arrest in Rb-defective Saos2 cells that express temperature-sensitive mutant p53 (ts p53). The activation of p53 at a permissive temperature (32.5 degrees C) induces the cell cycle arrest at both the G1 and G2 stages. The induction of several p53-responsive genes as well as a small form of p130 (S-p130) was detected upon p53 activation. S-p130 retained the functions as a pocket protein and was dominant over p130 at the protein level after 36 h at 32.5 degrees C. A canonical p53 binding site was identified in intron 4 of p130. Furthermore, a novel p53-inducible transcript containing a partial intron 4 sequence downstream of the p53 binding site and exon 5 of p130 was detected by RT-PCR, suggesting S-p130 is induced by p53 at transcriptional level. The results from gel shift assay and immunoprecipitation showed that S-p130 as well as p130 formed complexes with both E2F1 and E2F4 at a permissive temperature. Moreover, the transient expression of E1A (12S) and E2F1 effectively abrogated p53-induced cell cycle arrest. These results strongly suggested that p130 and its truncated form might substitute Rb in mediating p53-induced cell cycle arrest in Rb(-/-) Saos2 cells."

The regions involved in these direct interactions have either signal transfer or general binding functions (Buck, E., Li, J., Chen, Y., Weng, G., Scarlata, S., and Iyengar, R. (1999) Science 283, 1332–1335). Although key determinants of signal transfer regions for G protein subunits have been identified, the mechanisms of signal transfer are not fully understood. We have used a combinatorial peptide approach to analyze one Gβ region, Gβ86–105, involved in signal transfer to the effector phospholipase C (PLC)-β2 to gain a more mechanistic understanding of Gβ/PLC-β2 signaling. Binding and functional studies with the combinatorial peptides on interaction with and stimulation/inhibition of phospholipase Cβ2 indicate that binding affinity can be resolved from EC50 for functional effects, such that peptides that have wild type binding affinities have 15- to 20-fold lower EC50 values. Although more potent, these peptides display a much lower extent of maximal stimulation. These peptides synergize with Gβγ or peptides encoding the second Gβ42–54 signal transfer region in maximally stimulating phospholipase C-β2. Other combinatorial peptides from the Gβ86–105 region that bind to PLC-β2 by themselves submaximally stimulate and extensively inhibit Gβγ stimulation of PLC-β2.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). Both the Gα subunit and the Gβγ complex of the G protein can interact with effectors (2Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Effectors for Gα include adenylyl cyclases and phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) isoforms. Effectors for Gβγ subunits include G protein inwardly rectifying K+ channels, Ca2+ channels, and PLC-β isoforms (3Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). We have found that regions of G protein subunits important for signal transfer can be resolved from regions important for binding alone (4Buck E. Li J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,5Chen Y. Yoo B. Lee J.B. Weng G. Iyengar R. J. Biol.

For Gβγ stimulation of the effector PLC-β2, one Gβ region, Gβ86–105, functions directly in signal transmission. A peptide derived from this region can regulate PLC-β2 activity on its own in the absence of Gβγ subunits. Another region of Gβ, 115–135, is involved in binding but does not transmit signals, because it does not affect PLC-β2 activity by itself but inhibits Gβγ stimulation. Therefore, it is possible to separate general binding domains from signal transfer regions for a protein-protein interaction within intracellular signal flow. Further analysis has shown that Gβ relies on modular collections of these signal transfer and general binding units (6Buck E. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36014-36019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We had previously used substituted and truncated peptides to determine the amino acid characteristics of one of the Gβ signal transfer regions, the Gβ 86–105 region, that render it capable of PLC-β2 stimulation (4Buck E. Li J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Residues Lys-89 and Arg-96 are important for its potency (4Buck E. Li J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Buck E. Iyengar R. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 344: 513-521Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The six-amino acid region Gβ 96–101 represents a core signal transfer region, and all contacts contributing to signal transfer for the Gβ 86–105 signal transfer region likely lie within the Gβ 96–101 six-amino acid region. However, the Gβ 96–101 region displays significantly lower EC50 for PLC-β2 stimulation, indicating that there may exist important binding contacts within Gβ 86–105 but outside of Gβ 96–101. How the architecture of the Gβ 86–105 signal transfer region supports effector regulation is still unclear. Would the mechanism for signal transfer be driven largely by complementarity of the interactions between preformed surfaces, including those between charged residues, or by dynamic processes wherein residues on Gβ involved in signal transfer to PLC-β2 retain conformational flexibility to induce change in activity in PLC-β2 by transient interactions? To address these issues, herein, we have used a combinatorial peptide library approach to study both binding and functional regulation. Our data suggest that the mechanism of signal transfer to PLC-β2 is likely to rely on dynamic contacts with this effector that are distinct from those contacts involved in general binding affinity. Library vectors and electrocompetent cells were a gift from Affymax, Palo Alto, CA. All oligonucleotides were from Genelink, Syracuse, NY. All peptides were purchased from the Tufts University core facility. The 96-well plates were from Dynatech. Sources of other reagents have been previously described (4Buck E. Li J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Buck E. Iyengar R. J. Biol.

Human PLC-β2 was expressed in Hi5 insect cells by infection with recombinant baculovirus. Hi5 cells were grown in a 1-liter flask in suspension culture in 200 ml of sf900 media (Invitrogen) with shaking until the cell density reached 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were then infected with 20 ml of PLC-β2 recombinant baculovirus supernatant. About 3 days post infection the cells were collected. The cells were spun at 1000 rpm for 10 min to produce a pellet. The media was decanted, and the cell pellet was washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were again spun at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The wash was decanted, and the pellet was resuspended into 20 ml of ice-cold PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors and DTT (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT). The cells were lysed by decompression in a Par bomb after equilibration at 600 p.s.i. for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was then ultracentrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and distributed into 50-μl aliquots. These aliquots were frozen on dry ice and ethylene glycol and then stored at −70 °C. Human PLC-β2 was expressed in Hi5 insect cells, harvested, and lysed in 25 ml of lysis buffer, as described previously. Following lysis using the Par bomb, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 500 mm. The lysis mix was allowed to rotate at 4 °C for about 30 min. The lysate was then centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was reserved (∼25 ml) and added to 6.25 ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid bead slurry (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with lysis buffer. The lysis/slurry mix was allowed to rotate for about 2 h at 4 °C. The slurry mix was then poured into a Kontex column at 4 °C. The column was first washed with 70 ml (about 10 column volumes) of high salt wash buffer (10 mmsodium Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 800 mm NaCl, 0.5% C12E10, 15 mm imidazole) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 mm DTT. The column was then washed with 70 ml (about 10 column volumes) of low salt wash buffer (10 mm sodium Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole) supplemented with protease inhibitors and DTT, as before. PLC-β2 was then eluted by washing the column with six successive 4-ml elutions of elution buffer (10 mm sodium Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 125 mm imidazole) supplemented with protease inhibitors and DTT, as before. 25-μl aliquots of each of the six fractions were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with BSA standards to determine purity and the concentration of PLC-β2. Usually, the second and third fractions that contained highly (>95%) purified PLCβ2 were aliquoted, frozen on dry ice and ethanol, and stored at −70 °C. All peptides were purchased from the Tufts University Core Facility. Peptides were high-performance liquid chromatography-purified, and their identity was verified by mass spectrometry. When needed, peptides were dissolved in HED buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 1 mm DTT). Gβγ was purified from bovine brain as previously described (8Dingus J. Wilcox M.D. Kohnken R. Hildebrandt J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift of Dr. John Hildebrandt. Two different batches of Gβγ were used in this study. The EC50 values for PLC-β2 of the Gβγ from these two batches were different. For the Gβγ used in the experiments shown in Fig. 3 the EC50 for PLC-β2 stimulation was ∼200 nm. In contrast, for the experiments in Fig. 4, the second preparation of Gβγ had an EC50 of ∼50 nmfor PLC-β2 stimulation.Figure 4A, effect of varying concentrations of the T8 peptide on PLC-β2 basal activity.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). About 10–15 μg of cytosolic fraction of PLC-β2 was used per 100-μl reaction. Phospholipid substrate was a mixture of [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ([3H]PIP2) and unlabeled phospholipids. [3H]PIP2 was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled phospholipids were crude lipids from bovine brain and were from Sigma (P6023). The total diphosphoinositide and triphosphoinositide content was 20–40%. The remainder was a mixture of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine. Phospholipids were sonicated in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) to form micelles. A total of 0.01 μCi of [3H]PIP2, corresponding to about 7000 cpm, and 5 μg of unlabeled mixed phospholipids were used per reaction. Substrate, PLC-β2, peptide, and Gβγ subunits were mixed on ice in 100 μl of buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmMgCl2. Reactions were started by the addition of 25 μl of 2.5 mm CaCl2 in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) and incubated at 32 °C for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform:methanol:HCl (mixed 1:1:1 by volume) and 250 μl of EDTA. After extraction, 400 μl of the aqueous phase was counted on a Beckman scintillation counter. All experiments were repeated at least three times with very similar results. Typical experiments are shown. Recombinant PLC-β2 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified, and fluorescent studies were done as described (10Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To label PLC-β2 with the amine-reactive probe Cascade Blue acetyl azide (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR), the pH was raised to 8.0 and a 4-fold excess of probe was added. The reaction was kept on ice for 30 min before dialysis in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.16 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mmEGTA. Peptides were labeled with 4-dimethulaminophenylazophenyl-4′-maleimide, a non-fluorescent energy transfer acceptor, in the presence of an equimolar amount of dye in the absence of reducing agents. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature and quenched with 5 mm DTT. The final labeling ratios, as determined by absorption, were 1:1 for Cascade Blue-PLC-β2 and 0.8 for the two 4-dimethulaminophenylazophenyl-4′-maleimide peptides. Fluorescence spectra were taken on an ISS-PC1 (ISS, Champaign, IL) photon-counting spectrofluorometer in a 3- by 3-mm cuvette with excitation at 380 nm and scanning from 400 to 560 nm. Escherichia coli ARI814 electrocompetent cells, the pJS142 library vector, and the pELM3 MBP vector were from Peter Schatz at Affymax Corp., Palo Alto, CA. The use of these reagents to construct combinatorial libraries has been previously described (11Schatz P.J. Cull M.G. Martin E.L. Gates C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The degenerate library oligonucleotide (5′-GA GGT GGT … NNN … TAA CTA AGT AAA GC), where NNN denotes the nucleotides encoding the 20-amino acid degenerate library, was chemically synthesized, gel-purified, and 5′-phosphorylated. Here, N denotes a probability of 70% wild type base and 10% each of the other three bases. This distribution leads to an approximate 50% probability that the wild type residue at each of the 20-amino acid positions will be mutated to another amino acid. The two-linker oligonucleotides, ON-829 and ON-830, were synthesized and 5′-phosphorylated. All oligonucleotides were from Genelink, Syracuse, NY. A Gβ 86–105 combinatorial peptide library based on the peptides on plasmids method was constructed and expressed as described in detail previously (11Schatz P.J. Cull M.G. Martin E.L. Gates C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Gilchrist A. Li A. Hamm H.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 388-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the library oligonucleotide was annealed with the two linker oligonucleotides and ligated into the pJS142 peptide on plasmid vector. The ligation was electroporated into ARI814 electrocompetent cells, amplified, and frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. A portion of the library was removed prior to amplification to determine the number of individual library clones. The size of the Gβ 86–105 combinatorial peptide library was greater than 109. The methods used for the panning protocol have been described in detail elsewhere (11Schatz P.J. Cull M.G. Martin E.L. Gates C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 0.25 μg of purified PLC-β2 in HEK buffer (35 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) was added to the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Dynatech) and allowed to shake gently at 4 °C for 1 h. This allowed PLC-β2 to adhere to the wells of the plates. The wells with PLC-β2 were designated as (+) PLC wells. For (−) PLC control wells, 100 μl of HEK buffer was added. All the wells were then blocked by the addition of 100 μl of a blocking agent. For round 1 of panning 1% BSA in HEKL buffer (35 mmHEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.2m α-lactose, 1 mm DTT (adjust pH to 7.5 with KOH)) was used to block the wells. For rounds two and three 1% nonfat dry milk in HEKL buffer was used as the blocking agent. After addition of blocking agent the plate was allowed to shake gently for 1 h at 4 °C. The wells were then washed four times with HEKL/blocking agent. After the final wash, 200 μl of the crude lysed library was added to the wells, and the plate was allowed to shake gently at 4 °C for 1 h. For the lysis procedure, please see Ref. 11Schatz P.J. Cull M.G. Martin E.L. Gates C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. During one set of round 3 panning the native Gβ 86–105 peptide was added at this step at a final concentration of 40 μm to compete with the library peptide clones for binding. The wells were then washed four times with HEKL/blocking agent. After the last wash 200 μl of 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA in HEKL/blocking agent was added, and the plate was allowed to shake at 4 °C for 30 min. The wells were then washed four times with HEKL and two times with HEK. Bound peptides on plasmids were then eluted by the addition of 50 μl of elution buffer (1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 0.2m KCl in HE). The plate was allowed to shake vigorously at room temperature for 30 min. All eluates were collected and combined in their respective sets, i.e. (+) and (−) PLC-β2 wells. pELM3 was digested withAge1 (New England BioLabs) followed by ScaI. The digest was run on a 1% agarose gel to resolve the 5.6-kb MBP vector fragment from a 1-kb fragment. The vector band was excised and gel-purified. Plasmid DNA from round 3 of panning was digested with BspE1 and ScaI. The digest was resolved on a 1% agarose gel, and the 0.9-kb peptide-encoding fragment was excised, gel-purified, and ligated into the pELM3 MBP vector at a vector-to-insert ratio of 1:2. The MBP-library peptide fusions were expressed under an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter in the pELM3 vector in ARI-814-competent cells. Lysates from these cells were frozen and stored at −70 °C . The procedure for the MBP ELISA has been previously described. 0.25 μg of purified PLC-β2 was added to the wells of a microtiter 96-well plate (Dynatech) and allowed to shake gently at 4 °C for 1 h. In no-PLC control wells 100 μl of HEK buffer was added. All wells were then blocked by adding 100 μl of 2% BSA in HEK with 1 mm DTT. Blocking was carried out shaking at 4 °C for 1 h. The MBP lysates were then thawed and diluted 1:100 in HEK with 1 mm DTT. Following blocking, the wells of the plate were washed 4× with HEK, 1 mm DTT. 100 μl of the diluted MBP lysates was then added to the wells, and the plate was allowed to shake for 1 h at 4 °C. The plate was washed 4× with PBS/0.05% Tween 20. The primary antibody, rabbit anti-MBP (New England BioLabs), was diluted 1/1000 in PBS. 100 μl of the diluted primary antibody was added to each well, and the plate was allowed to shake for 30 min at 4 °C. The plate was washed 4× with PBS/0.05% Tween. The secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), was diluted 1/7500 in PBS. 100 μl of the diluted secondary antibody was added to each well, and the plate was allowed to shake at 4 °C for 30 min. The plate was then washed 4× with PBS/0.05% Tween. 100 μl of the True Blue horseradish peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to the wells at room temperature. Color formed in about 10–20 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 2 n H2SO4. The plate was read at 450-nm wavelength in a Spectracount plate reader, Packard Instruments. A given peptide was scored as a positive binder if it generated an ELISA signal that was greater than two standard deviations above the blank. All of the experiments shown in Figs.

Cull M.G. Martin E.L. Gates C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The library had greater than 109individual members, and we completed three rounds of panning on PLC-β2 immobilized in microtiter plate wells. For one group of round 3 panning we used the wild type Gβ 86–105 peptide to compete away any peptide sequences that bound with affinities less than that of the wild type. Following panning, the DNA encoding captured peptides was subcloned into the pELM3 vector so that peptides could be expressed monovalently as a chimera with the maltose binding protein (MBP), thus enabling us to score the selected library peptides individually for binding in an MBP ELISA assay. We scored a peptide as a positive binder if it generated an ELISA signal that was greater than two standard deviations above the background signal. 25 peptides tested positively in the ELISA, and we sequenced the DNA that encoded each of these peptide clones. The sequences of the ELISA positive clones for round 3 of panning in the absence of and in presence of the wild type peptide are shown in Tables I andII, respectively. An amino acid position was considered as “selected for” if, in the pool of selected peptides, the homology at that position was greater than 70%. The amino acid positions in each group that we considered to be part of the consensus sequence are highlighted. Wild type amino acids Lys-89 (86% homology), Val-90 (93% homology), Ser-97 (71% homology), and Val-100 (75% homology) are selected for in binding interactions with PLC. Both our studies with substituted peptides from the Gβ 86–105 region and site-directed mutagenesis experiments of Gβ (13Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G.

Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) predicted that amino acid positions Lys-89 and Ser-97 might be key contributors to PLC-β2 affinity. Given the homologies of 93% for position 90 and 75% for position 100 in the pool of selected peptides from the library screen, these two residues are also likely to be important contributors to PLC-β2 binding affinity.Table ISequences of ELISA-positive clones from round three of panning Open table in a new tab Table IISequences of ELISA-positive clones from round three of panning in the presence of 40 μm of the Gβ 86–105 wild type peptideView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab When the wild type Gβ 86–105 peptide is allowed to compete with library peptides during the third round of panning for interactions with PLC, the resulting consensus sequence is more extensive and includes the following amino acid positions: Thr-87 (82% homology), Val-90 (94% homology), Pro-94 (73% homology), Arg-96 (82% homology), Ser-97 (73% homology), and Val-100 (82% homology). Three of these positions lie within Gβ 96–101, the region we had previously found to be the core signal transfer region for Gβ 86–105. A number of truncated peptides were selected, suggesting that the last one or two amino acid positions of this region, Gβ104 and Gβ105, probably do not substantially contribute to binding affinity for PLC-β2. We did not find any strong consensus, i.e. greater than 70% homology, for a switch of one amino acid for another at any position within Gβ 86–105. However, we did select some peptides where the lack of homology at a consensus position is accompanied by a switch at another amino acid position. An example is seen with the T14 peptide. This peptide lacks homology at consensus position 96. It has the substitution R96C. However, this mutation is accompanied by a mutation at position 99, W99R. This second mutation might compensate for the R96C mutation. Few selected peptides lack consensus at more than one amino acid position. Among the two groups of peptides,i.e. 25 total sequences, a non-conservative mutation of the basic amino acids at positions 89 and 96 is selected for only once. Our previous analysis of substituted peptides from the Gβ 86–105 region led us to predict that Lys-89, Arg-96, Ser-97, Ser-98, and Met-101 would likely to be important for binding and signal transfer for PLC (4Buck E. Li J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For round 3 of panning, when the wild type peptide was allowed to compete with the binding of the library peptides, we found consensus at positions Arg-96 and Ser-97 but failed to find good consensus at position 89 and very little consensus at position 101. Interestingly, the homology at position 89 dropped from 86% to 64% when the wild type peptide was used to compete during panning. Our interpretation of this result is that the contribution of position Lys-89 to binding affinity is less than that of Arg-96 and Ser-97. In selecting Arg-96 and Ser-97 for binding, changes at position Lys-89 might be tolerated. In our substituted peptide studies the peptide Gβ 86–105 M101N showed no measurable binding or activity. We did not find much of a consensus at position 101 in the library, but, as expected, we did not find any selected peptides with the M101N substitution. During the library screening we selected peptides that bound PLC-β2 with affinities greater than or equal to the wild type Gβ 86–105 region, and we tested whether the binding would translate into stimulation of PLC-β2 activity. To test if amino acid residues that make contacts important for tight binding also make contacts that directly generate signal transmission, we synthesized representative peptides that display the consensus sequence and measured the effect of these peptides on the activity of basal and Gβγ-simulated PLC-β2. We selected peptides from both panning groups on the basis of how well conserved they were at the six consensus positions for round 3 of panning in the presence of the wild type peptide. Our criterion was that they would have consensus at 5 or more of these 6 positi"
