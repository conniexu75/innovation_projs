https://openalex.org/W2170925079,"Gut microbial induction of host immune maturation exemplifies host-microbe mutualism. We colonized germ-free (GF) mice with mouse microbiota (MMb) or human microbiota (HMb) to determine whether small intestinal immune maturation depends on a coevolved host-specific microbiota. Gut bacterial numbers and phylum abundance were similar in MMb and HMb mice, but bacterial species differed, especially the Firmicutes. HMb mouse intestines had low levels of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, few proliferating T cells, few dendritic cells, and low antimicrobial peptide expression--all characteristics of GF mice. Rat microbiota also failed to fully expand intestinal T cell numbers in mice. Colonizing GF or HMb mice with mouse-segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) partially restored T cell numbers, suggesting that SFB and other MMb organisms are required for full immune maturation in mice. Importantly, MMb conferred better protection against Salmonella infection than HMb. A host-specific microbiota appears to be critical for a healthy immune system."

Whether p53 can also activate oxidative stress-induced necrosis is, however, unknown. Here, we uncover a role for p53 in activating necrosis. In response to oxidative stress, p53 accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix and triggers mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opening and necrosis by physical interaction with the PTP regulator cyclophilin D (CypD). Intriguingly, a robust p53-CypD complex forms during brain ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Thompson C.B. Death by design: apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). p53 is a critical transcriptional activator and exerts additional biochemical functions in the cytoplasm. In its central role as cellular stress sensor that responds to a myriad of signals including DNA damage, oxidative stress and ischemia, p53 controls programs of apoptosis via transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms to limit the propagation of damaged cells. p53-controlled apoptosis involves transcriptional induction of components of the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways including CD95, Puma, Noxa, Bax, and others, which cooperatively promote cell death (Brady et al., 2011Brady C.A.

In addition, p53 protein can directly promote mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) to trigger apoptosis by modulating the MOMP governing Bcl-2 family (Green and Kroemer, 2009Green D.R. Kroemer G. Cytoplasmic functions of the tumour suppressor p53.Nature. 2009; 458: 1127-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, Vaseva and Moll, 2009Vaseva A.V. Moll U.M. The mitochondrial p53 pathway.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). We and others previously identified a p53 protein-based mitochondrial apoptosis program. Upon stress, a cytoplasmic pool of p53 rapidly translocates to the mitochondrial surface, where it physically interacts with both anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members to inhibit or activate their respective functions, leading to MOMP and apoptosis. In this role, p53 acts like a BH3-only protein, either as direct activator of the Bax/Bak effectors, or as sensitizer/derepressor of Bcl-xL/2 and Mcl1 (Vaseva and Moll, 2009Vaseva A.V. Moll U.M. The mitochondrial p53 pathway.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). While in principle the proapoptotic effects of cytoplasmic p53 are not dependent on transcription by nuclear p53, the latter appears to enhance the function of cytoplasmic p53. p53 also has a complex role in regulating autophagy which can promote either cell survival under stress or cell death, dependent on context. Activated nuclear p53 can transcriptionally induce AMPK and sestrin1/2 with subsequent mTOR inhibition and autophagy. Autophagy can promote cell death when apoptosis is compromised, or act as reinforcement of apoptotic caspase signaling. The overlap between apoptosis and autophagy in p53-activated cell death is illustrated by the p53 target genes DRAM, Bax, and Puma, also shown to be positive autophagy regulators. Conversely, basal levels of p53 in the cytoplasm can directly inhibit autophagosomes (Vousden and Ryan, 2009Vousden K.H. Ryan K.M. p53 and metabolism.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Necrosis is the irreversible tissue destruction due to bioenergetic failure, and central to ischemia/reperfusion injury and oxidative damage as occurs in cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction. The fundamental difference to apoptosis is the rapid loss of cellular membrane potentials due to energy depletion and ion pump/channel failures, leading to swelling, rupture, and cytolysis. Mediators of necrosis are excess cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS levels. Rather than being a passive event, necrosis has emerged as a controlled cell death that induces an inflammatory response to stimulate tissue repair by selectively releasing factors like HMGB1 and HDGF from dying cells (Zong and Thompson, 2006Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Necrotic death as a cell fate.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Necrosis in ischemic tissues, which is experimentally modeled by H2O2 treatment of cultured cells, depends on cyclophilin D (CypD), the key regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) at the inner membrane whose opening leads to cell death (Halestrap, 2006Halestrap A.P. Calcium, mitochondria and reperfusion injury: a pore way to die.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). As shown by four independent strains, CypD−/− mice are resistant to ischemia-induced necrosis in myocardial infarction and stroke, and CypD-deficient mitochondria and cells are resistant to Ca2+ and H2O2-induced cell death. But notably, they remain sensitive to Bcl-2 family-driven apoptosis, emphasizing the two functionally distinct mitochondrial death systems (Baines et al., 2005Baines C.P. Kaiser R.A. Purcell N.H.

USA. 2005; 102: 12005-12010Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). PTP is a regulated nonselective water- and solute-passing protein channel spanning the inner (IMM) and outer (OMM) mitochondrial membranes at points of contact. The identity of the actual pore-forming proteins of PTP are still debated, since they appear in part dispensable (Baines, 2010Baines C.P. The cardiac mitochondrion: nexus of stress.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 61-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) but can encompass VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel) across the OMM, and ANT (adenine nucleotide translocase) across the IMM. In contrast, the prolyl isomerase CypD in the mitochondrial matrix is the essential regulator of the PTP pore opening, and the only genetically proven indispensable PTP component (Kroemer et al., 2007Kroemer G. Galluzzi L. Brenner C. Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization in cell death.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 99-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). H+ pumping out of the matrix creates the proton gradient ΔΨm across the IMM necessary to maintain mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. In unstressed cells, PTP is closed and the IMM impermeable to ions. Upon oxidative stress, sudden PTP opening causes massive ion influx that dissipates ΔΨm and shuts down oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. This is called mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT). Concomitantly, water influx causes matrix swelling, rupture of the rigid OMM and release of all sequestered cell death factors. mPT is triggered by mitochondrial matrix sequestration of high levels of cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS generated during oxidative damage. Clinically, CypD-triggered PTP opening and mPT is the driving pathophysiological force behind cerebral stroke, myocardial infarction and other vascular catastrophies that are leading causes of death. How CypD becomes activated to induce mPT remains unclear but depends on its prolyl isomerase activity. Cyclosporine A (CsA) potently and specifically prevents mPT by binding to CypD, inhibiting its isomerase activity and displacing it from the PTP (Kroemer et al., 2007Kroemer G. Galluzzi L. Brenner C. Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization in cell death.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 99-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether p53 can also activate oxidative stress-induced necrosis. Intriguingly, our findings provide genetic, biochemical and pharmacological evidence that fundamentally expands our understanding of p53-mediated cell death networks into necrosis. We identify an unexpected critical role of stress-accumulated mitochondrial p53 protein in directly regulating PTP at the inner membrane. Upon oxidative stress, p53 triggers PTP opening by engaging in a physical interaction with CypD, thereby inducing necrotic cell death in mouse and human cells. Importantly, this pathway is implicated in brain ischemia-reperfusion injury. We previously showed in isolated mitochondria that purified p53 causes robust cytochrome C (CytoC) release by inducing Bak oligomerization and MOMP with the same efficiency as tBid (Mihara et al., 2003Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. p53 has a direct apoptogenic role at the mitochondria.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar, Wolff et al., 2008Wolff S. Erster S. Palacios G. Moll U.M. p53's mitochondrial translocation and MOMP action is independent of Puma and Bax and severely disrupts mitochondrial membrane integrity.Cell Res. 2008; 18: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that p53 is able to release the entire gamut of soluble and nonsoluble apoptogenic factors including noncleaved apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and Endo G that are tethered to the IMM by severely disrupting both outer and inner mitochondrial membrane integrity. In contrast, tBid is restricted to releasing only soluble components via MOMP (Wolff et al., 2008Wolff S. Erster S. Palacios G. Moll U.M. p53's mitochondrial translocation and MOMP action is independent of Puma and Bax and severely disrupts mitochondrial membrane integrity.Cell Res. 2008; 18: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This suggests a stronger permeabilizing effect by p53 than by the prototypical activator of the Bax/Bak pore, tBid. Thus, we hypothesized that p53 is capable of recruiting additional BH3-independent pathways of mitochondrial permeabilization. To this end, we compared the release response of isolated WT and Bax/Bak double-knockout (DKO) mitochondria (Figure S1A available online) toward highly purified recombinant p53 and tBid. Bax/Bak DKO cells are deprived of the apoptotic gateway to mediate CytoC release for caspase activation (Kim et al., 2006Kim H. Rafiuddin-Shah M. Tu H.C. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Hierarchical regulation of mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis by BCL-2 subfamilies.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Indeed, p53 was able to rapidly release CytoC, Smac (soluble), and AIF (membrane tethered) from both WT and Bax/Bak DKO mitochondria, while the tBid-induced release was restricted to WT mitochondria (Figure 1A ). The strict Bax/Bak-dependence of tBid-mediated MOMP is completely consistent with the notion of tBid as direct activator of the Bax/Bak lipid pore, tBid's sole target (Kuwana et al., 2005Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Chipuk J.E. Bonzon C. Sullivan B.A. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

In contrast, p53 apparently has additional mitochondrial targets to mediate mitochondrial permeabilization.Figure 1Purified p53 Protein Opens the PTP Pore in Isolated Mitochondria Independent of Bax and Bak but Dependent on CypDShow full caption(A) In contrast to tBid, p53's MOMP activity can also be independent of Bax and Bak.

See also Figure S1. We reasoned that p53 might also engage the mitochondrial PTP pore. To look for evidence of p53-induced functional alterations of this pore, we used the fluorescent dye calcein, a highly selective indicator of sustained PTP opening in situ (Kroemer et al., 2007Kroemer G. Galluzzi L. Brenner C. Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization in cell death.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 99-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). MOMP and the Bax/Bak lipid pore are completely incompetent for calcein release (Petronilli et al., 1998Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F. Imaging the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in intact cells.Biofactors. 1998; 8: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Adding increasing doses of purified p53 to calcein-prelabeled WT or Bax/Bak DKO mitochondria resulted in a rapid and almost complete loss of signal, indicating PTP opening. In contrast, even the highest dose of tBid lacked any effect (Figure 1B and Figure S1B). Moreover, p53 but not tBid induced structural alterations of PTP components. WT mouse liver mitochondria were incubated with increasing amounts of purified p53 prior to chemical crosslinking. VDAC-containing complexes ranging from ∼60–300 kDa were readily detected in control mitochondria incubated with buffer or BSA but increasingly disappeared upon addition of p53 in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 1C and Figure S1C). Thus, p53 was able to drive VDAC into high molecular weight complexes that no longer entered the gel. This activity was unique to p53, since tBid had no effect on VDAC oligomerization (Figure 1D). Moreover, p53 but not tBid was able to induce swelling (another classical hallmark of PTP opening) of Bax/Bak DKO and WT mitochondria in a CsA-dependent (Figure 1E) and CypD-dependent (Figures 1F and 1G) manner. Thus, in addition to the Bax/Bak lipid pore, p53 can also engage the PTP pore to induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Based on these results, we next asked whether and if so upon which stimulus p53 interacts with components of the PTP complex. Since both p53 and mPT play important roles during oxidative stress (Gudkov and Komarova, 2010Gudkov A.V. Komarova E.A. Pathologies associated with the p53 response.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

Acta. 2009; 1787: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), we looked for an interaction between p53 and the PTP components CypD, ANT, and VDAC upon H2O2 treatment. Immunoprecipitation detected a prominent oxidative stress-induced endogenous complex between p53 and the essential regulatory PTP component CypD (Figure 2A ). No interaction was seen between p53 and the proposed structural components VDAC and ANT (Figure 2A). The H2O2-inducible specific p53-CypD complex was confirmed with pull-down assays of HA-tagged CypD, VDAC, and ANT expressed in cells with endogenous p53 (Figure 2B). Moreover, endogenous mitochondrial p53 binds to recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CypD in a CsA-dependent manner (Figure 2C). Finally, cell-free pull-down experiments with recombinant proteins confirmed the direct CsA-sensitive interaction (Figure 2D). Mapping experiments with a series of p53 deletion mutants identified p53 amino acids 80–220 as the region required for CypD interaction (Figure 2E and Figures S2A–S2C ). While we failed to identify a single specific subregion, the p53 contact domains that are required for Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 interaction (designated with “Δ”) (Mihara et al., 2003Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A.

Tetrameric p53 is the preferred partner for CypD interaction (Figure 2F), while it is debated whether mitochondrial p53 that directly triggers Bcl-2 family-mediated apoptosis at the OMM acts as monomer or tetramer (Heyne et al., 2008Heyne K.

Next, we asked whether p53 accumulates in mitochondria upon oxidative stress. Treating various wtp53 harboring cell lines and primary MEFs with 0.25–0.75 mM H2O2 uniformly induced robust cellular p53 stabilization (Figure 3A ). This oxidative stress-induced p53 response was fast, reaching its peak within 1 hr in most cells (Figure 3B). Immunofluorescence staining of C6 rat glioma cells treated with H2O2 for 4 hr showed primarily punctate perinuclear p53 accumulation, confirming earlier findings (Bonini et al., 2004Bonini P. Cicconi S. Cardinale A. Vitale C. Serafino A.L. Ciotti M.T. Marlier L.N. Oxidative stress induces p53-mediated apoptosis in glia: p53 transcription-independent way to die.J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which colocalized with CypD in mitochondria. This suggests an important mitochondrial function of the p53 protein within this window of time during oxidative stress (Figure 3C). Moreover, using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, p53 accumulated in mitochondria that were free of detectable contamination within 4 hr of H2O2 treatment (Figure 3D). Importantly, subsequent submitochondrial fractionation of this mitochondrial starting material (Figure S3A ) confirmed that during oxidative stress a fraction of p53 accumulated in the matrix where CypD is located, while some also localized to the surface, as expected (Figure 3E). The observed p53 fractions in the mitochondrial intermembranous space and inner membrane likely represent transport intermediates to the matrix. Moreover, H2O2-induced mitochondrial p53 was also partially protected from trypsin digestion in classical import assays (Figure S3B) and import of p53 required a mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure S3C). This is in agreement with hypoxia-induced endogenous complexes between p53 and the major matrix import proteins mtHSP70 and mtHSP60 (Figure S3D), which we had also reported earlier (Sansome et al., 2001Sansome C. Zaika A. Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M. Hypoxia death stimulus induces translocation of p53 protein to mitochondria.

Of note, the endogenous p53 that accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix is detectable by immunogold electron microscopy (see table in Figure S3E).Figure S3Upon Oxidative Stress, p53 Is Imported into the Mitochondrial Matrix, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) The starting material of isolated mitochondria from H2O2-treated HCT116 cells shown in Figure 3D was used for further submitochondrial fractionation (shown in Figure 3E).

Immunoblot analysis.(B) H2O2-induced mitochondrial p53 is partially protected in a classical import assay.

https://openalex.org/W2067761440,"A large fraction of the mammalian genome is organized into inactive chromosomal domains along the nuclear lamina. The mechanism by which these lamina associated domains (LADs) are established remains to be elucidated. Using genomic repositioning assays, we show that LADs, spanning the developmentally regulated IgH and Cyp3a loci contain discrete DNA regions that associate chromatin with the nuclear lamina and repress gene activity in fibroblasts. Lamina interaction is established during mitosis and likely involves the localized recruitment of Lamin B during late anaphase. Fine-scale mapping of LADs reveals numerous lamina-associating sequences (LASs), which are enriched for a GAGA motif. This repeated motif directs lamina association and is bound by the transcriptional repressor cKrox, in a complex with HDAC3 and Lap2β. Knockdown of cKrox or HDAC3 results in dissociation of LASs/LADs from the nuclear lamina. These results reveal a mechanism that couples nuclear compartmentalization of chromatin domains with the control of gene activity."
https://openalex.org/W1989716780,"Plastid-derived signals are known to coordinate expression of nuclear genes encoding plastid-localized proteins in a process termed retrograde signaling. To date, the identity of retrograde-signaling molecules has remained elusive. Here, we show that methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP), a precursor of isoprenoids produced by the plastidial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, elicits the expression of selected stress-responsive nuclear-encoded plastidial proteins. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations of the individual MEP pathway metabolite levels demonstrate the high specificity of MEcPP as an inducer of these targeted stress-responsive genes. We further demonstrate that abiotic stresses elevate MEcPP levels, eliciting the expression of the aforementioned genes. We propose that the MEP pathway, in addition to producing isoprenoids, functions as a stress sensor and a coordinator of expression of targeted stress-responsive nuclear genes via modulation of the levels of MEcPP, a specific and critical retrograde-signaling metabolite."

We determined the genome-wide binding of remodeler complexes SWI/SNF, RSC, ISW1a, ISW1b, ISW2, and INO80 to individual nucleosomes in Saccharomyces, and determined their functional contributions to nucleosome positioning through deletion analysis. We applied ultra-high-resolution ChIP-exo mapping to Isw2 to determine its subnucleosomal orientation and organization on a genomic scale. Remodelers interacted with selected nucleosome positions relative to the start and end of genes and produced net directionality in moving nucleosomes either away or toward nucleosome-free regions at the 5′ and 3′ ends of genes. Isw2 possessed a subnucleosomal organization in accord with biochemical and crystallographic-based models that place its linker binding region within promoters and abutted against Reb1-bound locations.

Nucleosome-free regions organize the directional packing of nucleosomal arrays ISWI and SWI/SNF remodelers engage in a positional tug-of-war with nucleosome arrays ISW1a and ISW2 move nucleosomes toward NFRs, others move nucleosomes away The nucleosome is the basic repeating unit of chromatin. Genome-wide mapping of nucleosome positions reveals that they are organized into uniformly spaced arrays at the 5′ and, to a lesser extent, 3′ ends of genes (Jiang and Pugh, 2009bJiang C. Pugh B.F. Nucleosome positioning and gene regulation: advances through genomics.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Most genes are bounded by nucleosome-free promoter and termination regions (NFRs), although a select subset of repressed genes have a nucleosome situated over the promoter. Arrays start with the “+1” nucleosome positioned at a fairly precise distance from the transcription start site (TSS). A “−1” nucleosome, located on the upstream side of the promoter NFR, is positioned to potentially control access to gene regulatory sequences. While the underlying DNA sequence contributes substantially to the occupancy levels of nucleosomes across a genome (Segal and Widom, 2009Segal E. Widom J. What controls nucleosome positions?.Trends Genet. 2009; 25: 335-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes play a key role in guiding their proper positioning at the start and end of genes on a genomic scale (Whitehouse et al., 2007Whitehouse I.

They are classified based on the sequence homology of their conserved ATPase subunit into four distinct families: ISWI (ISW1a, ISW1b, and ISW2), INO80/SWR1, CHD, and SWI/SNF (including RSC) (Mellor and Morillon, 2004Mellor J.

However, their biochemical mechanism of nucleosome movement can be thought of in terms of two groups: ISWI and SWI/SNF, based upon requirements for flanking linker DNA sequences. In the ISWI group, Isw1, Isw2, Chd1, and Ino80 require extranucleosomal linker DNA to reposition nucleosomes (Whitehouse et al., 2003Whitehouse I. Stockdale C. Flaus A. Szczelkun M.D. Owen-Hughes T.

These chromatin remodelers may pull linker DNA on to nucleosomes, thereby causing nucleosomes to move toward the linker until the linker is too short to promote binding. In vitro, the ISWI group moves nucleosomes from the end of a DNA fragment to the middle, which is an activity that may help equally space nucleosomes in an array (Tsukiyama et al., 1999Tsukiyama T.

Not only do SWI/SNF and RSC transfer histone octamers to exogenous DNA in trans, but they also slide nucleosomes without the requirement of extranucleosomal DNA (Whitehouse et al., 1999Whitehouse I.

Furthermore, if sliding encounters another nucleosome, packing or nucleosome eviction may occur by RSC (Boeger et al., 2004Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D.

The genome-wide contribution of chromatin remodelers to nucleosome positioning in yeast has been examined through remodeler mutants (Whitehouse et al., 2007Whitehouse I. Rando O.J. Delrow J.

A role for Snf2-related nucleosome-spacing enzymes in genome-wide nucleosome organization.Science. 2011; 333: 1758-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Isw2 reportedly binds to regions flanking NFRs and repositions nucleosomes toward the NFR to suppress cryptic transcription initiation events (Whitehouse et al., 2007Whitehouse I. Rando O.J. Delrow J. Tsukiyama T. Chromatin remodelling at promoters suppresses antisense transcription.Nature. 2007; 450: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In contrast, RSC moves nucleosomes away from the NFR (Hartley and Madhani, 2009Hartley P.D. Madhani H.D. Mechanisms that specify promoter nucleosome location and identity.Cell. 2009; 137: 445-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Isw1 functions more toward the middle of genes, where it promotes the repositioning of nucleosomes toward the 3′ direction (Tirosh et al., 2010Tirosh I. Sigal N. Barkai N. Widespread remodeling of mid-coding sequence nucleosomes by Isw1.Genome Biol. 2010; 11: R49Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The combined action of ISWI-type remodelers may help define nucleosome positioning in gene bodies (Gkikopoulos et al., 2011Gkikopoulos T. Schofield P. Singh V. Pinskaya M. Mellor J. Smolle M. Workman J.L. Barton G.J. Owen-Hughes T. A role for Snf2-related nucleosome-spacing enzymes in genome-wide nucleosome organization.Science. 2011; 333: 1758-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). An important open question that we address here is whether each remodeler has selectivity for specific nucleosome positions in and around genes. In addition, we expand on existing genome-wide studies to examine a comprehensive set of remodeler deletions to address whether such nucleosome selectivity of binding imparts directionality. We further investigate the notion of remodeler directionality by focusing on Isw2, where we employ a ChIP-exo technique to reveal the directional subnucleosomal and linker contacts made by Isw2 on a genomic scale. This analysis suggests a mechanism by which Isw2 might pack nucleosomes against Reb1 in the NFR to repress transcription. Our study suggests that remodelers are nucleosome position- and orientation-specific and move nucleosomes with predetermined net directionality relative to NFRs. Saccharomyces contains approximately 60,000 nucleosomes. To examine which consensus positions are potentially bound by specific remodelers, we conducted genome-wide remodeler-nucleosome interaction assays, based on an experimental design to detect the interaction of transcription factors with nucleosomes (Koerber et al., 2009Koerber R.T. Rhee H.S. Jiang C. Pugh B.F. Interaction of transcriptional regulators with specific nucleosomes across the Saccharomyces genome.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 889-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These assays involve standard formaldehyde-crosslinking chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in which the chromatin is fragmented to mononucleosomes using MNase. DNA fragments that immunoprecipitate with a specific chromatin remodeler subunit are then detected by deep sequencing. Chromatin remodelers are notoriously difficult to assay by using ChIP, perhaps owing to inefficient crosslinking and/or a transient presence at any one place during the course of their catalytic cycle of nucleosome remodeling (Ng et al., 2002Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Genome-wide location and regulated recruitment of the RSC nucleosome-remodeling complex.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, Whitehouse et al., 2007Whitehouse I. Rando O.J. Delrow J. Tsukiyama T. Chromatin remodelling at promoters suppresses antisense transcription.Nature. 2007; 450: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To maximize our “hit” rate, we conducted MNase-ChIP on 20 remodeler subunits that may be in close association with the nucleosome. These 20 subunits are components of the remodeler complexes SWI/SNF, RSC, ISW1a, ISW1b, ISW2, INO80, and CHD1. Consistent with the difficulties associated with immunoprecipitating remodelers in combination with the additional requirement that our MNase-ChIP required the generation of ∼150 bp MNase-resistant DNA, some of the tested remodeler proteins did not show detectable interactions (Figure S1A available online). However, eight remodeler subunits (Ioc3, Isw2, Arp5, Ino80, Rsc8, Snf2, Ioc4, and Isw1) were successfully assayed and carried forward for genome-wide analysis (Table S1). These subunits represent a mix of catalytic and regulatory subunits. The catalytic subunits are the definitive core of the complexes, and thus their detection should be definitive of remodeler presence. As a control, histone H3 was immunoprecipitated in parallel to identify all genomic nucleosomes. Untagged BY4741 and Sua7-TAP strains served as negative controls. Sua7 is the TFIIB component of the transcription preinitiation complex. Because it resides in the NFR, its interaction with nucleosomes is expected to be negligible (Koerber et al., 2009Koerber R.T. Rhee H.S. Jiang C. Pugh B.F. Interaction of transcriptional regulators with specific nucleosomes across the Saccharomyces genome.Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 889-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For each sequence tag associated with a remodeler-bound nucleosome, a putative nucleosomal dyad was derived. Dyad distributions were then collapsed to single tracks, one track per gene, aligned by their TSS (David et al., 2006David L. Huber W. Granovskaia M. Toedling J. Palm C.J. Bofkin L. Jones T. Davis R.W. Steinmetz L.M. A high-resolution map of transcription in the yeast genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 5320-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and k-means clustered (Figures 1A and S1A). Results from multiple k values indicated a single predominant gene cluster within each data set (data not shown). These clusters constituted the set of genes that were enriched with remodeler-bound nucleosomes. We further collapsed individual clusters into a single track (blue tracks in Figure 1B), along with the distribution of all nucleosomes (i.e., H3 MNase ChIP) for the same subset of genes (gray tracks). We observed that each tested remodeler subunit crosslinked to specific nucleosome positions relative to the TSS (summarized in Table 1). These observations, however, are based on raw tag distributions of remodeler-bound nucleosomes, which did not take into account the underlying intrinsic nucleosome occupancy levels. We therefore made peak calls to derive consensus nucleosome positions and their occupancy levels (tag counts within the peak region; Table S1). These remodeler-bound nucleosome levels were then normalized to the corresponding histone H3 occupancy levels. A composite of position-specific densities is shown in Figure 1B (in red). With this normalization, the selectivity of individual remodelers for specific nucleosome positions became even more evident.Table 1Summary of Chromatin Remodeler-Nucleosome InteractionsProteinComplexATPase Family5′ EndaChromatin remodeler interacting nucleosomes located near the 5′ end of the genes.3′ EndbChromatin remodeler interacting nucleosomes located near the 3′ end of the genes.Arp5INO80INO80+1NoneIno80INO80INO80AllTNIoc3ISW1aISWI+1TNIoc4ISW1bISWI+2, +3, +4TN-1Isw1ISW1a/ISW1bISWIAllAllIsw2ISW2ISWI+1TNRsc8RSCSWI/SNF−1, +1, +2, +3NoneSnf2SWI/SNFSWI/SNF−2, +1, +2, +3NoneThe following abbreviations are used: TN, terminal nucleosomes; None, no interaction is seen in this region.a Chromatin remodeler interacting nucleosomes located near the 5′ end of the genes.b Chromatin remodeler interacting nucleosomes located near the 3′ end of the genes. Open table in a new tab The following abbreviations are used: TN, terminal nucleosomes; None, no interaction is seen in this region. We found that Rsc8 (RSC) and Snf2 (SWI/SNF) crosslinked predominantly to the first three genic nucleosomes, and to selected positions upstream of the TSS, which is consistent with an earlier lower resolution report (Ng et al., 2002Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Genome-wide location and regulated recruitment of the RSC nucleosome-remodeling complex.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). SWI/SNF was largely depleted at the −1 position but enriched at −2. Based on current models of SWI/SNF action (Boeger et al., 2004Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Removal of promoter nucleosomes by disassembly rather than sliding in vivo.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 667-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), this would place SWI/SNF in position to remove the adjacent −1 nucleosome. Isw2 crosslinked predominantly to the +1 position, as reported previously (Whitehouse et al., 2007Whitehouse I. Rando O.J. Delrow J. Tsukiyama T. Chromatin remodelling at promoters suppresses antisense transcription.Nature. 2007; 450: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The catalytic Isw1 subunit, found in at least two ISWI-type complexes ISW1a and ISW1b (Vary et al., 2003Vary Jr., J.C. Gangaraju V.K. Qin J. Landel C.C. Kooperberg C. Bartholomew B. Tsukiyama T. Yeast Isw1p forms two separable complexes in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), was spread across all genic nucleosome positions. However, the regulatory subunit Ioc3 (ISW1a) was particularly enriched at the +1 position, whereas Ioc4 (ISW1b) was enriched at positions +2, +3, and +4, which is consistent with their distinct functional roles (Morillon et al., 2003Morillon A. Karabetsou N. O'Sullivan J. Kent N. Proudfoot N. Mellor J. Isw1 chromatin remodeling ATPase coordinates transcription elongation and termination by RNA polymerase II.Cell. 2003; 115: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Additional Ioc3 interactions were observed at the −2 nucleosome position, which is in line with a previous suggestion (Yamada et al., 2011Yamada K. Frouws T.D. Angst B. Fitzgerald D.J. DeLuca C. Schimmele K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Structure and mechanism of the chromatin remodelling factor ISW1a.Nature. 2011; 472: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ioc subunits may confer distinct genome-wide positional (and functional) specificities on Isw1. Similarly, Ino80 was spread across many positions, although the Arp5 subunit of the INO80 complex was particularly enriched at the +1 position. This suggests that Ino80 may also exist apart from at least one of its subunits. Several additional experiments and analyses address the robustness of these results. First, similar conclusions were evident when the patterns were normalized to nucleosome occupancy level (Figure 1B). Second, patterns were reproducible across multiple biological replicates. Third, positional selectivity patterns were unique to the remodeler subunit being tested, which is an outcome that would be unlikely if the patterns were arising from noise in the data. Fourth, an untagged BY4741 negative control failed to generate a pattern (Figure S1B). Fifth, the general transcription factor TFIIB (Sua7), which binds to promoter NFRs, generated a distinct pattern (consistent with NFR binding) (Figure S1B). Sixth, the remodeler-bound nucleosome positions did not have intrinsically high or low H3 occupancy (data not shown), indicating that they were not outliers. Taken together, these findings suggest that chromatin remodeling complexes preferentially occupy specific nucleosome positions in and around a subset of all genes across the yeast genome. These positions are defined by their proximity to the TSS. The analysis of position selectivity within coding regions suggested two major themes, one in which certain remodeler subunits crosslinked predominantly with the +1 nucleosome and another where remodelers crosslinked at multiple positions within genes. Thus, the +1 nucleosome appears to be handled differently by remodelers compared to the other genic nucleosomes. NFRs, positioned nucleosomes, and antisense noncoding transcription exist at the 3′ ends of genes, but little is known about the presence or function of remodelers in organizing these regions. We examined the distribution of remodeler-bound nucleosomes relative to the terminal nucleosome of each gene (as defined by the wild-type data set). We found that Ioc3 (ISW1a), Isw2, and Ino80 crosslinked directly with the terminal nucleosome (Figure 2A ). Isw1 crosslinked minimally with the last three nucleosome positions, consistent with results indicative of association across gene bodies. Ioc4 (ISW1b) crosslinked specifically with the penultimate terminal nucleosome, which is consistent with its role in transcription termination (Alén et al., 2002Alén C. Kent N.A. Jones H.S.

Isw1 chromatin remodeling ATPase coordinates transcription elongation and termination by RNA polymerase II.Cell. 2003; 115: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A composite of position-specific densities is shown in Figure 2B (in red), highlighting the selectivity of individual remodelers for specific nucleosome positions at the end of genes. This specific targeting of remodelers to the 3′ end of genes was similar but inverted to the pattern observed at the 5′ end. For example, ISW1a, INO80, and ISW2 targeted both the first and last nucleosomes, whereas Ioc4 (ISW1b) was particularly enriched at penultimate nucleosomes. Our clustering analysis did not detect significant interactions between RSC or SWI/SNF with terminal nucleosomes, indicating that they may be selective for sense-driven mRNA gene expression, at least with respect to measurable binding in this assay. We next asked whether a remodeler binding at one end of a gene might work coordinately with, independently of, or mutually exclusively of any remodeler at the other end of the gene. We calculated the correlation between remodeler-nucleosome interactions at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the same gene (Figure 2C). As expected, nucleosome association with Isw1, which is found across gene bodies, was highly correlated between the 5′ and 3′ ends. The same was observed for Ioc4, which was more position selective than Isw1. We interpret these findings to indicate that Isw1 works across the body of genes from end to end, but as part of ISW1b (as defined by Ioc4), it may be more restricted to penultimate nucleosome positions at both ends of coding genes. Whether the continuity of Isw1 throughout gene bodies contributes to the coordinated presence of Ioc4 at both ends is unclear. INO80-nucleosome interactions were also highly linked between the 5′ and 3′ ends (Figure 2C), which further supports our suggestion of gene-specific 5′-3′ coordination of certain remodelers. The notion that chromatin remodelers target specific nucleosome positions raises the question as to whether there is coordination among the remodelers so as to regulate entire genic nucleosomal arrays. We examined all pairwise co-occurrence of genes (as opposed to nucleosomes) enriched with any two remodelers by calculating both the p-value and the percentage of co-occurrence (Figure 3). Nucleosomes crosslinked to Ino80, Isw1, and Isw2 had the largest number of genes in common (Figure 3A, right panel), suggesting that these remodelers work together. As expected, both Ioc3 and Ioc4 overlapped substantially with Isw1. However, Ioc3 and Ioc4 overlapped very little with each other, indicating that ISW1a and ISW1b may target distinct sets of genes, as previously reported (Vary et al., 2003Vary Jr., J.C. Gangaraju V.K. Qin J. Landel C.C. Kooperberg C. Bartholomew B. Tsukiyama T. Yeast Isw1p forms two separable complexes in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). RSC and SWI/SNF tended to be bound to different genes than the ISWI and INO80 remodelers (although some overlap between INO80 and RSC was observed). RSC and SWI/SNF overlapped very little with each other, all of which may reflect fundamental differences in the function of ISWI-type versus SWI/SNF-type remodelers. An illustration of the distinct groups of genes bound by the various remodelers and their occupied nucleosome positions is illustrated in Figure 4. These findings suggest that the INO80 and ISWI complexes act collectively over many nucleosome positions within genic arrays, whereas the RSC and SWI/SNF complexes act separately and are more restricted to nucleosomes at the 5′ ends of genes. Chromatin remodelers position nucleosomes on genomic DNA, perhaps by translocation in cis until some barrier is reached. How a division of labor among remodelers leads to well-defined nucleosome organization across genomes remains unclear. In particular, do remodelers translocate nucleosomes toward or away from promoters? Is the directionality reversed at the 3′ ends of genes? The question of remodeler directionalities has been examined in part for Isw2 (Whitehouse et al., 2007Whitehouse I. Rando O.J. Delrow J. Tsukiyama T.

To determine the contribution of all remodelers to nucleosome positioning on a genome-wide scale, we generated a high-resolution map of all nucleosome positions (via MNase H3 ChIP-seq) in strains harboring deletions of various chromatin remodeler subunits. From a population of nucleosomal tags, we calculated a single consensus dyad location for each nucleosome (Figure 5A ). A porti"

Large-scale transcriptome analysis examines the expression of human pseudogenes Pseudogene expression can be ubiquitous or lineage or cancer specific ATP8A2Ψ and CXADRΨ show specific breast and prostate cancer expression, respectively The study provides a framework for analyzing pseudogene expression from RNA-Seq data Pseudogenes are ancestral copies of protein-coding genes that arise from genomic duplication or retrotransposition of mRNA sequences into the genome followed by accumulation of deleterious mutations due to loss of selection pressure, degenerating eventually into so-called genetic fossils (Sasidharan and Gerstein, 2008Sasidharan R. Gerstein M. Genomics: protein fossils live on as RNA.Nature. 2008; 453: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Pseudogenes pervade the genome, representing virtually every coding gene, and due to their extremely close sequence similarity with their cognate genes, complicate whole-genome sequencing and gene expression analyses. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests their potential roles in regulating cognate wild-type gene expression/function by serving as a source of endogenous siRNA (Tam et al., 2008Tam O.H.

Katoh M. IGSF11 gene, frequently up-regulated in intestinal-type gastric cancer, encodes adhesion molecule homologous to CXADR, FLJ22415 and ESAM.Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 525-531PubMed Google Scholar). Pseudogene transcription has also been shown to regulate cognate wild-type gene expression by sequestering miRNAs (Poliseno et al., 2010Poliseno L. Salmena L. Zhang J. Carver B. Haveman W.J. Pandolfi P.P. A coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates tumour biology.Nature. 2010; 465: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). The recently described competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks comprising sets of coordinately expressed genes with shared miRNA response elements (MREs) provide an additional dimension of (post-) transcriptional regulation in which the role of pseudogenes might overlap with those of protein-coding genes (Salmena et al., 2011Salmena L.

Gerstein M.B. A computational approach for identifying pseudogenes in the ENCODE regions.Genome Biol. 2006; 7 (S13, 1–10)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These individual pipelines were subsequently consolidated into an integrated consensus platform, ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE), which now serves as the definitive database of manually curated and annotated pseudogenes as well as pseudogene transcripts (Zheng et al., 2007Zheng D. Frankish A. Baertsch R. Kapranov P. Reymond A. Choo S.W. Lu Y. Denoeud F. Antonarakis S.E. Snyder M. et al.Pseudogenes in the ENCODE regions: consensus annotation, analysis of transcription, and evolution.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). By contrast, genome-wide analyses of pseudogene expression have been somewhat arbitrary, mainly relying upon evidence of pseudogene transcripts obtained from disparate gene expression platforms, including public mRNA and EST databases, cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) studies, and gene identification signature-paired end tags (GIS-PET) (Ruan et al., 2007Ruan Y. Ooi H.S. Choo S.W. Chiu K.P. Zhao X.D. Srinivasan K.G. Yao F. Choo C.Y. Liu J.

Given the essentially anecdotal observations of pseudogene expression, only 160 expressed human pseudogenes are currently documented in ENCODE. Though this could be due to a general lack of transcription of pseudogenes, as generally presumed, it may also be reflective of an insufficient and uneven depth of coverage afforded by early gene expression analysis tools. In this context, the recent maturation of next-generation high-throughput sequencing platforms provides unprecedented access to genome-wide expression analyses previously not achievable (Han et al., 2011aHan H. Nutiu R. Moffat J. Blencowe B.J. SnapShot: High-throughput sequencing applications.Cell. 2011; 146: 1044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Morozova et al., 2009Morozova O.

Here, we analyzed a compendium of RNA-Seq transcriptome data specifically focusing on pseudogene transcripts from a total of 293 samples encompassing 13 different tissue types, including 248 cancer and 45 benign samples. In order to carry out a systematic analysis of pseudogene expression, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline focused on detecting pseudogene transcription. This integrative approach provided evidence of expression for 2,082 distinct pseudogenes, which displayed lineage-specific, cancer-specific, as well as ubiquitous expression patterns. Taken together, this Resource nominates a multitude of expressed pseudogenes that merit further investigation to determine their roles in biology and in human disease. Paired-end RNA-Seq data from a compendium of 293 samples, representing both cancer and benign samples from 13 different tissue types recently generated in our laboratory, was utilized to build a pseudogene analysis pipeline (Figure 1 and Figure S1 and Table S1 available online). Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome (hg18) and University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genes using Efficient Alignment of Nucleotide Databases (ELAND) software of the Illumina Genome Analyzer Pipeline (Table S2). Reads showing mismatches to the reference genes but mapping perfectly to unannotated regions elsewhere in the genome were used as the primary data for pseudogene expression analysis. Two or more unique, high-quality overlapping reads nucleating at the loci of differences between wild-type genes and pseudogenes were used to define de novo “clusters” (ranging from 40 to 5,000 bp). These clusters were employed for gene expression analyses in a way analogous to the “probes” used in microarray gene expression studies, though unlike predesigned and fixed probes used in microarrays, the sequence clusters used here were formed de novo, solely based on the presence (and levels) of transcripts. Thus, one or more clusters (like one or more probes in microarrays) represented a transcript, whereas the number of reads mapping to a cluster (analogous to fluorescence intensity due to probe hybridization on microarrays) provided a measure of expression of the corresponding (pseudo)genes. For example, Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the cluster alignments for two representative pseudogenes, ATP8A2-Ψ (Figure 2A) and CXADR-Ψ (Figure 2B). As can be seen, mutation-dense regions in the reference sequence provide foci of pseudogene-specific cluster formation. Naturally, pseudogenes with sparse and dispersed mutations nucleate fewer clusters and require higher depth of coverage for reliable detection.Figure S1Samples Comprising the Transcriptome Sequencing Data Compendium, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Pie chart showing relative distribution of samples from each tissue type (left); Bar chart representing the numbers of samples in the indicated categories in each tissue type.(B) Table indicating the number of samples in each sub-category with a summary of passed Purity Filter (PF) read count (in millions).

Overall, 2,156 unique pseudogene transcript clusters were identified, and their genomic coordinates (start and end points) were compared with the coordinates of pseudogenes annotated in the ENCODE (Zheng et al., 2007Zheng D. Frankish A. Baertsch R. Kapranov P. Reymond A. Choo S.W. Lu Y. Denoeud F. Antonarakis S.E.

Yan Y. Zheng D. Zhang Z. Carriero N. Cayting P. Harrrison P. Gerstein M. Pseudogene.org: a comprehensive database and comparison platform for pseudogene annotation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D55-D60Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the two most comprehensive pseudogene annotation databases. Genomic coordinates of 934 unique pseudogene transcript clusters in our data set were found to overlap with the pseudogene coordinates annotated in both Yale and ENCODE databases. In addition, 585 clusters overlapped with Yale and 92 with ENCODE databases, displaying a high degree of overall concordance between our data and the authentic resources and highlighting a level of difference between the two reference databases (that necessitated our consideration of both resources). Further, as multiple clusters can sometimes represent one distinct pseudogene transcript, the 2,156 transcript clusters provided evidence for 2,082 distinct transcripts. Of these, 1,506 transcripts overlap with the genomic coordinates of pseudogenes in Yale and/or ENCODE, and up to 576 transcripts are potentially novel (described below) (Figure S2A ). The 2,082 pseudogene transcripts, in turn, correspond to 1,437 wild-type genes, clearly indicating that the transcripts of multiple pseudogenes arisen from the same wild-type genes are also detected in our compendium. Taken together, our study provides evidence of widespread transcription of pseudogenes unraveled by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (Table S3). Pseudogene clusters across the sample-wise compendium reveal that pseudogenes of housekeeping genes such as ribosomal proteins are widely expressed across tissue types. Additionally, pseudogene transcripts corresponding to CALM2 (calmodulin 2 phosphorylase kinase, delta), TOMM40 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40), NONO (non-POU domain-containing, octamer-binding), DUSP8 (dual-specificity phosphatase 8), PERP (TP53 apoptosis effector), and YES (v-yes-1 Yamaguchi sarcoma viral oncogene homolog 1), etc. were observed in more than 50 samples each, which were further validated by pseudogene-specific RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing (Table S4). Further, because our RNA-Seq compendium comprises 35- to 45-mer short sequence reads that largely generated short sequence clusters not optimal for available pseudogene analysis tools such as Pseudopipe (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang Z. Carriero N. Zheng D. Karro J. Harrison P.M. Gerstein M. PseudoPipe: an automated pseudogene identification pipeline.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1437-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and Pseudofam (Lam et al., 2009Lam H.Y. Khurana E. Fang G. Cayting P. Carriero N. Cheung K.H. Gerstein M.B. Pseudofam: the pseudogene families database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D738-D743Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) used in generating ENCODE and Yale databases, we carried out a direct query of individual clusters against the human genome (hg18) using the BLAT tool from UCSC, which is ideally suited for short sequence alignment searches (Kent, 2002Kent W.J. BLAT—the BLAST-like alignment tool.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (6179) Google Scholar). Based on this “custom” analysis, or simply BLAT (Figure S2A), we were able to independently assign 1,888 clusters representing 1,820 unique pseudogenes to unique genomic locations. Comparing the genomic locations of the pseudogene clusters identified by BLAT analysis to those identified by Yale and ENCODE databases (Figure S2A), 762 clusters were found to be common to all three resources, but a remarkably large set of 585 clusters was uniquely defined by BLAT analysis alone. Some of the pseudogene transcripts thus identified included BAT1, BTBD1, COX7A2L, CTNND1, EIF5, PAPOLA, PARP11, SYT, ZBTB12, and others (n = 25) and were validated by Sanger sequencing (Table S4). Thus, analysis of RNA-Seq data provided a reliable assessment of expressed pseudogenes. Though designating the BLAT-based pseudogene clusters as novel pseudogenes must await further sequence characterization (such as analysis of ORF structure and potential genesis of novel protein-coding gene family members, etc.), a small subset of clusters was seen to be localized in the vicinity of known pseudogenes. Thus, we found 92 clusters that resided adjacent (within 5 kb) to previously annotated pseudogenes (Figure S2B, left), and we hypothesize that these may represent pseudogenes with inaccurate annotations in the current databases. For example, the chromosomal coordinates of CENTG2-Ψ (OTTHUMT00000085288, Havana processed pseudogene) are defined in ENCODE as Chr1:177822463-177824935. As expected, we observed a cluster mapping to this locus; however, interestingly, we also observed a distinct cluster (Chr1:177825028-177826295) less than 100 base pairs away. Although unannotated in the current databases, the sequence of this adjacent locus shows a high degree of homology to the CENTG2 parental gene (Figure S2B, right), strongly suggesting that this cluster represents an extension of the existing genomic coordinates of CENTG2-Ψ annotation. Similar observations were made with HNRNPA1 and the HNRNPA1-Ψ on Chr6q27 (Figure S2B, right). 493 BLAT derived clusters that were not in close proximity to annotated pseudogenes likely represent putative pseudogenes currently missing in the database annotations (Table S3B). Next, we assessed the technical and analytical factors influencing the yield of pseudogene transcripts. As may be expected, a positive correlation was observed between the sequencing depth and total number of pseudogene transcripts (correlation coefficient, +0.65) (Figure S3A ). However, no significant correlation was observed between the absolute measure of percent similarity between pseudogene-WT pairs and pseudogene yield. Importantly, the metric of overall percent similarity accounts for gap penalty and mismatches in BLAT search, but it is the “distribution” of the mismatches that is critical in resolving pseudogenes from nearly identical wild-type sequences; for example, a few mismatches, accumulated in a small stretch, are more effective in confidently distinguishing pseudogene expression from wild-types as compared to a higher number of mismatches that are scattered over long stretches of sequence (Figure 2). Thus, three primary factors determine the detection of pseudogene transcription by RNA-Seq: (1) the level of expression of the pseudogenes (i.e., the higher the level of expression, the higher the likelihood of detection), (2) the depth of RNA sequencing, and (3) overall distribution of mismatches with respect to the wild-type.Figure S4Sequence Alignment of ATP8A2-WT and Ψ (Top) and CXADR-WT and Ψ (Bottom) Using Multialign Interface, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThe regions of differences between the wild-type and pseudogene sequences are shown in the red.

The regions with contiguous stretches of differences in the two genes were used in designing the Taqman assays. To explore the loci of transcription regulatory elements associated with pseudogene transcription, we carried out ChIP-Seq analysis of a breast cancer cell line MCF7 probed with H3K4me3, a histone mark associated with transcriptionally active chromosomal loci, and integrated the results with the MCF7 pseudogene transcript data. Interestingly, we observed a statistically significant enrichment of H3K4me3 peaks at expressed pseudogene loci as compared to nonexpressed pseudogenes (p = 0.0054) (Figure S3B), suggesting that the pseudogene transcripts observed by RNA-Seq are associated with transcriptionally active genomic loci. Interestingly, the pseudogene transcripts associated with H3K4me3 peaks encompass both unprocessed and processed pseudogenes, with no discernible differences in the pattern of expression. Considering the role of 3′ UTRs with MREs in ceRNA regulatory networks, we also looked at the frequency of 3′ UTR sequences retained in our set of pseudogene transcripts and observed that at least 71% of all pseudogene transcripts retain distinct 3′ UTR sequences similar to their cognate wild-type genes (Figure S3C). Interestingly, comparing the pseudogene transcripts with a list of genes implicated in ceRNA networks (Han et al., 2011bHan Y.J. Ma S.F. Yourek G. Park Y.D. Garcia J.G. A transcribed pseudogene of MYLK promotes cell proliferation.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Tay et al., 2011Tay Y. Kats L. Salmena L. Weiss D. Tan S.M. Ala U.

Di Cunto F. et al.Coding-independent regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by competing endogenous mRNAs.Cell. 2011; 147: 344-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), we observed more than 400 overlapping transcripts (Table S5). The presence of noncoding pseudogene transcripts with similar 3′ UTRs (and MREs) adds a further level of complexity to ceRNA regulatory networks. Next, we assessed a potential correlation between the expression of pseudogenes present within the introns of unrelated, expressed genes with their “host” genes. Interestingly, no significant association was observed, suggesting that pseudogenes are likely subject to independent regulatory mechanisms even when residing within other transcriptionally active genes. Further, our observations with the breast-specific unprocessed pseudogene ATP8A2 (likely arisen from duplication of wild-type ATP8A2, thus likely harboring similar promoter elements) also indicate that there is no apparent correlation between the pseudogene expression with the wild-type gene that is expressed ubiquitously (described later). Thus, in summary, although it is tempting to speculate that pseudogene expression may be regulated by the promoter elements from the cognate gene or the host genes, our data suggest that more complex/indirect factors may be at play. Next, we assessed a possible correlation between the expression of pseudogenes with that of cognate wild-type genes, and intriguingly, no significant pattern of correlation was observed (Figure S3D). Focusing on the pseudogenes whose genomic coordinates are annotated in the reference databases, we next analyzed the expression profiles of the 1,056 unique transcripts. Analyzing the expression data from 248 cancer and 45 benign samples from 13 different tissue types (total 293 samples), we observed broad patterns of pseudogene expression, including 1,056 pseudogenes that were detected in multiple samples (Table S6), which supports the hypothesis that transcribed pseudogenes contribute to the typical transcriptional repertoire of cells. In addition, we identified distinct patterns of pseudogene expression, akin to that of protein-coding genes, including 154 highly tissue/lineage-specific and 848 moderately tissue/lineage-specific (or enriched) pseudogenes (Figure 3A ). Moreover, we found 165 pseudogenes exhibiting expression in more than 10 of the 13 tissue types examined, and these we classified as ubiquitous pseudogenes whose transcription is characteristic of most cell types (Figure 3A, bottom). Of the 165 ubiquitous pseudogenes, a majority belonged to housekeeping genes, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal proteins, several cytokeratins, and other genes widely expressed in most cell types. This is expected, as these genes are known to have numerous pseudogenes, and it is likely that several of these pseudogenes retain the capacity for widespread transcription, mimicking their protein-coding counterparts. A second set of pseudogenes exhibited near ubiquitous expression but were frequently transcribed at lower levels in most tissues and robustly transcribed in one or two tissues. These pseudogenes were termed “nonspecific,” and this group harbors more than 870 pseudogenes, comprising a large portion of our data set (Figure 3A, middle). Many of the pseudogenes previously shown to be expressed were found in this category, including some pseudogenes reported as tissue specific, such as CYP4Z2P, a pseudogene previously reported to be expressed only in breast cancer tissues (Rieger et al., 2004Rieger M.A. Ebner R.

https://openalex.org/W2055989887,"RNA polymerase is a ratchet machine that oscillates between productive and backtracked states at numerous DNA positions. Since its first description 15 years ago, backtracking--the reversible sliding of RNA polymerase along DNA and RNA--has been implicated in many critical processes in bacteria and eukaryotes, including the control of transcription elongation, pausing, termination, fidelity, and genome instability."
https://openalex.org/W2149136324,"Receptor tyrosine kinase activity is known to occur in the absence of extracellular stimuli. Importantly, this ""background"" level of receptor phosphorylation is insufficient to effect a downstream response, suggesting that strict controls are present and prohibit full activation. Here a mechanism is described in which control of FGFR2 activation is provided by the adaptor protein Grb2. Dimeric Grb2 binds to the C termini of two FGFR2 molecules. This heterotetramer is capable of a low-level receptor transphosphorylation, but C-terminal phosphorylation and recruitment of signaling proteins are sterically hindered. Upon stimulation, FGFR2 phosphorylates tyrosine residues on Grb2, promoting dissociation from the receptor and allowing full activation of downstream signaling. These observations establish a role for Grb2 as an active regulator of RTK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2048508307,"Secretory fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors are known for their regulatory function in the early stages of neural development. FGF13, a nonsecretory protein of the FGF family, is expressed in cerebral cortical neurons during development and is a candidate gene for syndromal and nonspecific forms of X-chromosome-linked mental retardation (XLMR). However, its function during development remains unclear. We show that FGF13 acts intracellularly as a microtubule-stabilizing protein required for axon and leading process development and neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. FGF13 is enriched in axonal growth cones and interacts directly with microtubules. Furthermore, FGF13 polymerizes tubulins and stabilizes microtubules. The loss of FGF13 impairs neuronal polarization and increases the branching of axons and leading processes. Genetic deletion of FGF13 in mice results in neuronal migration defects in both the neocortex and the hippocampus. FGF13-deficient mice also exhibit weakened learning and memory, which is correlated to XLMR patients' intellectual disability."
https://openalex.org/W1972760080,"Secreted Wnt morphogens are signaling molecules essential for embryogenesis, pathogenesis, and regeneration and require distinct modifications for secretion, gradient formation, and activity. Whether Wnt proteins can be posttranslationally inactivated during development and homeostasis is unknown. Here we identify, through functional cDNA screening, a transmembrane protein Tiki1 that is expressed specifically in the dorsal Spemann-Mangold Organizer and is required for anterior development during Xenopus embryogenesis. Tiki1 antagonizes Wnt function in embryos and human cells via a TIKI homology domain that is conserved from bacteria to mammals and acts likely as a protease to cleave eight amino-terminal residues of a Wnt protein, resulting in oxidized Wnt oligomers that exhibit normal secretion but minimized receptor-binding capability. Our findings identify a Wnt-specific protease that controls head formation, reveal a mechanism for morphogen inactivation through proteolysis-induced oxidation-oligomerization, and suggest a role of the Wnt amino terminus in evasion of oxidizing inactivation. TIKI proteins may represent potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2096601649,"Mitosis is triggered by the activation of Cdk1-cyclin B1 and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Positive feedback loops regulate the activation of Cdk1-cyclin B1 and help make the process irreversible and all-or-none in character. Here we examine whether an analogous process, spatial positive feedback, regulates Cdk1-cyclin B1 redistribution. We used chemical biology approaches and live-cell microscopy to show that nuclear Cdk1-cyclin B1 promotes the translocation of Cdk1-cyclin B1 to the nucleus. Mechanistic studies suggest that cyclin B1 phosphorylation promotes nuclear translocation and, conversely, nuclear translocation promotes cyclin B1 phosphorylation, accounting for the feedback. Interfering with the abruptness of Cdk1-cyclin B1 translocation affects the timing and synchronicity of subsequent mitotic events, underscoring the functional importance of this feedback. We propose that spatial positive feedback ensures a rapid, complete, robust, and irreversible transition from interphase to mitosis and suggest that bistable spatiotemporal switches may be widespread in biological regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1994034558,"Birthweight is used as an indicator of intrauterine growth, and determinants of birthweight are widely studied. Less is known about determinants of deviating patterns of growth in utero. We aimed to study the effects of maternal characteristics on both birthweight and fetal growth in third trimester and introduce placental weight as a possible determinant of both birthweight and fetal growth in third trimester.The STORK study is a prospective cohort study including 1031 healthy pregnant women of Scandinavian heritage with singleton pregnancies. Maternal determinants (age, parity, body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain and fasting plasma glucose) of birthweight and fetal growth estimated by biometric ultrasound measures were explored by linear regression models. Two models were fitted, one with only maternal characteristics and one which included placental weight.Placental weight was a significant determinant of birthweight. Parity, BMI, weight gain and fasting glucose remained significant when adjusted for placental weight. Introducing placental weight as a covariate reduced the effect estimate of the other variables in the model by 62% for BMI, 40% for weight gain, 33% for glucose and 22% for parity. Determinants of fetal growth were parity, BMI and weight gain, but not fasting glucose. Placental weight was significant as an independent variable. Parity, BMI and weight gain remained significant when adjusted for placental weight. Introducing placental weight reduced the effect of BMI on fetal growth by 23%, weight gain by 14% and parity by 17%.In conclusion, we find that placental weight is an important determinant of both birthweight and fetal growth. Our findings indicate that placental weight markedly modifies the effect of maternal determinants of both birthweight and fetal growth. The differential effect of third trimester glucose on birthweight and growth parameters illustrates that birthweight and fetal growth are not identical entities."
https://openalex.org/W1998096270,"Background Although the relationship between serum uric acid (SUA) and adiposity is well established, the direction of the causality is still unclear in the presence of conflicting evidences. We used a bidirectional Mendelian randomization approach to explore the nature and direction of causality between SUA and adiposity in a population-based study of Caucasians aged 35 to 75 years. Methods and Findings We used, as instrumental variables, rs6855911 within the SUA gene SLC2A9 in one direction, and combinations of SNPs within the adiposity genes FTO, MC4R and TMEM18 in the other direction. Adiposity markers included weight, body mass index, waist circumference and fat mass. We applied a two-stage least squares regression: a regression of SUA/adiposity markers on our instruments in the first stage and a regression of the response of interest on the fitted values from the first stage regression in the second stage. SUA explained by the SLC2A9 instrument was not associated to fat mass (regression coefficient [95% confidence interval]: 0.05 [−0.10, 0.19] for fat mass) contrasting with the ordinary least square estimate (0.37 [0.34, 0.40]). By contrast, fat mass explained by genetic variants of the FTO, MC4R and TMEM18 genes was positively and significantly associated to SUA (0.31 [0.01, 0.62]), similar to the ordinary least square estimate (0.27 [0.25, 0.29]). Results were similar for the other adiposity markers. Conclusions Using a bidirectional Mendelian randomization approach in adult Caucasians, our findings suggest that elevated SUA is a consequence rather than a cause of adiposity."
https://openalex.org/W2023027570,"Glutamate-induced cytotoxicity is partially mediated by enhanced oxidative stress. The objectives of the present study are to determine the effects of glutamate on mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy regulating factors and to explore the protective effects of selenium against glutamate cytotoxicity in murine neuronal HT22 cells. Our results demonstrated that glutamate resulted in cell death in a dose-dependent manner and supplementation of 100 nM sodium selenite prevented the detrimental effects of glutamate on cell survival. The glutamate induced cytotoxicity was associated with mitochondrial hyperpolarization, increased ROS production and enhanced oxygen consumption. Selenium reversed these alterations. Furthermore, glutamate increased the levels of mitochondrial fission protein markers pDrp1 and Fis1 and caused increase in mitochondrial fragmentation. Selenium corrected the glutamate-caused mitochondrial dynamic imbalance and reduced the number of cells with fragmented mitochondria. Finally, glutamate activated autophagy markers Beclin 1 and LC3-II, while selenium prevented the activation. These results suggest that glutamate targets the mitochondria and selenium supplementation within physiological concentration is capable of preventing the detrimental effects of glutamate on the mitochondria. Therefore, adequate selenium supplementation may be an efficient strategy to prevent the detrimental glutamate toxicity and further studies are warranted to define the therapeutic potentials of selenium in animal disease models and in human."

Transcription initiation begins with the formation of a closed promoter complex, which contains the 10 subunit Pol II core, the Pol II subcomplex Rpb4/7, and the transcription factors (TF) IID (which includes the TATA-box binding protein TBP and TBP-associated factors), TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Isomerisation of the closed to the open promoter complex involves separation of the DNA strands (i.e., DNA “melting”) to form an unwound DNA region (the transcription “bubble”) and positioning of the emerging template single strand in the active center of Pol II, which allows RNA synthesis to initiate from the transcription start site (Saunders et al., 2006Saunders A.

All structures and models were superimposed onto the structure of the 12 subunit Pol II (PDB code 1WCM) (Armache et al., 2005Armache K.J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. Structures of complete RNA polymerase II and its subcomplex, Rpb4/7.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which was used as a reference. Modeling, prior to animation, was performed with Coot (Emsley et al., 2010Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17085) Google Scholar). We used UCSF Chimera to generate all animations, labeling, and morphing interpolations between structures (Pettersen et al., 2004Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera—a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput.

Initiation and elongation factors are colored green and orange, respectively, and flexible polypeptide chains are represented by dotted lines. The orientations of Pol II complexes shown in the movie are restricted to either the front or side views used in earlier publications (Cramer et al., 2001Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D.

See Movie S1 online to download for teaching purposes. The movie starts with the formation of the initiation-competent Pol II-TFIIF complex (Figures 1A and 2A). Binding of the 10 subunit Pol II core (Cramer et al., 2001Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Structural basis of transcription: RNA polymerase II at 2.8 angstrom resolution.Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) to the Pol II subcomplex Rpb4/7 (Armache et al., 2005Armache K.J. Mitterweger S. Meinhart A. Cramer P. Structures of complete RNA polymerase II and its subcomplex, Rpb4/7.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7131-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) generates the complete, 12 subunit enzyme (Armache et al., 2003Armache K.J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P.

Kornberg R.D. Complete, 12-subunit RNA polymerase II at 4.1-A resolution: implications for the initiation of transcription. Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 6969-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Rpb4/7 binding stabilizes a closed conformation of the Pol II clamp domain, which only permits passage of single-stranded DNA to the active site (Armache et al., 2003Armache K.J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Architecture of initiation-competent 12-subunit RNA polymerase II.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The complete Pol II is apparently relevant for initiation and elongation because Rpb4/7 is required for initiation in vitro (Edwards et al., 1991Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. Two dissociable subunits of yeast RNA polymerase II stimulate the initiation of transcription at a promoter in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because the complete Pol II is associated with the genome in vivo (Jasiak et al., 2008Jasiak A.J. Hartmann H. Karakasili E. Kalocsay M. Flatley A. Kremmer E. Strässer K. Martin D.E. Söding J. Cramer P. Genome-associated RNA polymerase II includes the dissociable Rpb4/7 subcomplex.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26423-26427Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Subsequent binding of TFIIF to Pol II generates the complete Pol II-TFIIF complex. We positioned the dimerization domain of TFIIF on the lobe domain of Pol II based on crosslinking data (Chen et al., 2010Chen Z.A. Jawhari A. Fischer L. Buchen C. Tahir S. Kamenski T. Rasmussen M. Lariviere L. Bukowski-Wills J.-C.

Position of the general transcription factor TFIIF within the RNA polymerase II transcription preinitiation complex.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the next stage of the movie, the Pol II-TFIIF complex binds the TBP-TFIIB-DNA complex, resulting in a minimal closed promoter complex, in accordance with the classic model for initiation complex formation (Buratowski et al., 1989Buratowski S.

Five intermediate complexes in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II.Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) (Figures 1B and 2B). The closed complex model was derived by combining crystal structures of the Pol II-TFIIB complex (Kostrewa et al., 2009Kostrewa D. Zeller M.E. Armache K.-J. Seizl M. Leike K. Thomm M. Cramer P.

Structural basis of preinitiation complex assembly on human pol II promoters.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This model reveals the central role of TFIIB as a bridge between the promoter and the polymerase. Docking of the TBP-TFIIB-DNA complex onto the Pol II-TFIIF complex involves the binding of the TFIIB N-terminal ribbon domain to the Pol II dock domain and the binding of the C-terminal TFIIB core domain to the polymerase wall. The TFIIB reader and linker regions connect the N- and C-terminal domains of TFIIB and extend through the Pol II cleft (Figures 1B, 2B, and 2C). The minimal initiation complex in the movie corresponds to the essential transcription machinery in archaea (Qureshi et al., 1997Qureshi S.A. Bell S.D. Jackson S.P.

https://openalex.org/W1986906282,"Background Numerous studies have demonstrated the higher-order functions of the cerebellum, including emotion regulation and cognitive processing, and have indicated that the cerebellum should therefore be included in the pathophysiological models of major depressive disorder. The aim of this study was to compare the resting-state functional connectivity of the cerebellum in adults with major depression and healthy controls. Methods Twenty adults with major depression and 20 gender-, age-, and education-matched controls were investigated using seed-based resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging. Results Compared with the controls, depressed patients showed significantly increased functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the temporal poles. However, significantly reduced cerebellar functional connectivity was observed in the patient group in relation to both the default-mode network, mainly including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and the executive control network, mainly including the superior frontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. Moreover, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was negatively correlated with the functional connectivity between the bilateral Lobule VIIb and the right superior frontal gyrus in depressed patients. Conclusions This study demonstrated increased cerebellar coupling with the temporal poles and reduced coupling with the regions in the default-mode and executive control networks in adults with major depression. These differences between patients and controls could be associated with the emotional disturbances and cognitive control function deficits that accompany major depression. Aberrant cerebellar connectivity during major depression may also imply a substantial role for the cerebellum in the pathophysiological models of depression."

We analysed the deregulation at the transcriptional level of the genes encoding Rab proteins and Rab-interacting proteins in bladder cancer pathogenesis, distinguishing between the two main progression pathways so far identified in bladder cancer: the Ta pathway characterized by a high frequency of FGFR3 mutation and the carcinoma in situ pathway where no or infrequent FGFR3 mutations have been identified. A systematic literature search identified 61 genes encoding Rab proteins and 223 genes encoding Rab-interacting proteins. Transcriptomic data were obtained for normal urothelium samples and for two independent bladder cancer data sets corresponding to 152 and 75 tumors. Gene deregulation was analysed with the SAM (significant analysis of microarray) test or the binomial test. Overall, 30 genes were down-regulated, and 13 were up-regulated in the tumor samples. Five of these deregulated genes (LEPRE1, MICAL2, RAB23, STXBP1, SYTL1) were specifically deregulated in FGFR3-non-mutated muscle-invasive tumors. No gene encoding a Rab or Rab-interacting protein was found to be specifically deregulated in FGFR3-mutated tumors. Cluster analysis showed that the RAB27 gene cluster (comprising the genes encoding RAB27 and its interacting partners) was deregulated and that this deregulation was associated with both pathways of bladder cancer pathogenesis. Finally, we found that the expression of KIF20A and ZWINT was associated with that of proliferation markers and that the expression of MLPH, MYO5B, RAB11A, RAB11FIP1, RAB20 and SYTL2 was associated with that of urothelial cell differentiation markers. This systematic analysis of Rab and Rab effector gene deregulation in bladder cancer, taking relevant tumor subgroups into account, provides insight into the possible roles of Rab proteins and their effectors in bladder cancer pathogenesis. This approach is applicable to other group of genes and types of cancer."

Prokaryotic actin and tubulin homologs possess low-protein sequence identity to their eukaryotic counterparts; however, the degree of structural homology is quite high. The cell shape determining protein MreB, for example, is structurally similar to actin even though it only shares limited sequence identity within residues that line the nucleotide-binding pocket (Thanbichler and Shapiro, 2008Thanbichler M.

Löwe J. Prokaryotic origin of the actin cytoskeleton.Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of MreB, >35 families of actin homologs have been identified that perform a diverse set of functions from forming scaffolds to actively segregating DNA (Derman et al., 2009Derman A.I.

Despite having similar monomeric structures, many of these actins have evolved unique biochemical properties and form filaments with distinct structural features (Becker et al., 2006Becker E.

Although it is now clear that a key feature of the bacterial actin cytoskeleton is its remarkable diversity of sequence and function, relatively few families of tubulin-like proteins have been characterized in prokaryotes, raising the question of whether bacterial tubulins are similarly biochemically and structurally diverse. The most widely conserved bacterial tubulin is FtsZ, which is found in nearly all bacteria and many archaea. FtsZ assembles an essential component of the cytokinetic ring required for septation (de Boer, 2010de Boer P.A. Advances in understanding E. coli cell fission.Curr. Opin.

Wang Q. Michie K.A. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Filament structure of bacterial tubulin homologue TubZ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We characterize one member of this family (GP59) from Pseudomonas chlororaphis phage 201ϕ2-1 (Thomas et al., 2008Thomas J.A. Rolando M.R. Carroll C.A. Shen P.S. Belnap D.M. Weintraub S.T. Serwer P.

Characterization of Pseudomonas chlororaphis myovirus 201varphi2-1 via genomic sequencing, mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy.Virology. 2008; 376: 330-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Isolated from soil samples in 2001, 201ϕ2-1 is one of the largest phage genomes in GenBank at 316 kb. We determined the structure of PhuZ to 1.67 Å resolution and characterized PhuZ polymerization in vivo and in vitro. We show that PhuZ assembles dynamic polymers required for positioning phage DNA at the cell center and that accurate positioning is important for phage reproduction. We surveyed the genomic database and found a number of tubulin-like protein sequences encoded within several different phage genomes. A phylogenetic tree demonstrates that these phage-encoded tubulins are extraordinarily diverse and are only distantly related to the cell division protein FtsZ and the plasmid segregation protein TubZ (Figures 1A and 1B). All of the phage genomes encoding these tubulins are very large, ranging from 186 to 316 kb, and they infect both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Although many of these phage have been characterized previously, no evidence for a tubulin-based cytoskeletal polymer has been reported. To study one of these tubulin-like proteins and determine if it had the ability to polymerize in vivo, we generated a GFP fusion to the phuZ gene (gp59) from phage 201ϕ2-1 and expressed it from the arabinose promoter (Qiu et al., 2008Qiu D. Damron F.H. Mima T. Schweizer H.P. Yu H.D. PBAD-based shuttle vectors for functional analysis of toxic and highly regulated genes in Pseudomonas and Burkholderia spp. and other bacteria.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 7422-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) on a plasmid in P. chlororaphis. When expressed at 30°C at low levels (0.15% or 0.25% arabinose), fluorescence from GFP-PhuZ was uniform throughout the cell (Figure 2A ). As the arabinose concentration increased, a threshold concentration (0.4%) was reached where the majority of cells (82%) spontaneously assembled filaments (Figures 2A and 2E). Quantitation of GFP-PhuZ expression using in-gel fluorescence demonstrated that the fusion protein was full length and that expression increased linearly with arabinose concentration (see Figure S1 available online). When expressed just above the threshold inducer concentration for assembly (0.4%), cells contained multiple filaments (Figure 2A) that moved rapidly throughout the cell (Movie S1). At higher expression levels (1%), GFP-PhuZ filaments extended the entire length of the cell (Figure 2A).Figure S1Additional Data on the Second Catalytic GFP-PhuZ Mutant and Dynamics of Wild-Type Uninfected Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Fluorescent micrographs of P. chlororaphis cells (ME42) expressing GFP-PhuZD187A grown at 30°C and induced with the indicated amount (%) of arabinose.

To gain insight into the nature of PhuZ filaments observed in vivo, PhuZ was expressed recombinantly, purified (Figure S2A ), and its in vitro polymer growth kinetics examined by right-angle light scattering. As with other tubulins, PhuZ polymerizes in a GTP-dependent manner, with no polymerization observed in the presence of GDP (Figure 3A ). It also displays a lag phase characteristic of a nucleation-extension mechanism of polymer growth. As expected, the length of the lag phase and maximum signal at the plateau are proportional to the concentration of PhuZ, from which we determine the critical concentration to be 2.8 ± 0.1 μM (Figure S2B).Figure 3In Vitro Polymerization of PhuZShow full caption(A) Right-angle light-scattering traces of PhuZ polymerization at 5 μM (red), 6.25 μM (blue), and 7.5 μM (green) upon addition of 1 mM GTP are illustrated.

To assess the morphology of PhuZ filaments, PhuZ was polymerized in vitro in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GMPCPP and examined by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM). Figure 3C shows a representative micrograph of individual PhuZ filaments together with high-magnification views (also Figure S2). The morphology of PhuZ filaments is distinct from microtubules formed by tubulin and single-stranded filaments formed by FtsZ but is reminiscent of the two-stranded, helical filaments formed by TubZ (Aylett et al., 2010Aylett C.H. Wang Q. Michie K.A. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Filament structure of bacterial tubulin homologue TubZ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although crossover events are observed in the PhuZ filaments, they appear at irregular intervals, and their architecture is not immediately evident. Further EM analysis will be required to determine the detailed structure of the filaments. To better understand the similarities and differences between PhuZ and other tubulins, crystals of wild-type and Se-Met PhuZ were grown in the presence of GDP, and the structure of Se-Met PhuZ was solved by MAD phasing (Table S1) and subsequently refined using the 1.67 Å resolution, wild-type PhuZ-GDP data (Figure 4A ). The initial 2Fo-Fc electron density maps at 1.67 Å showed strong density for GDP in the nucleotide-binding pocket (Figure 4B). As in other tubulins, the structure of PhuZ consists of two domains: an N-terminal domain containing the nucleotide-binding pocket (Figure 4B) and C-terminal domain, bridged by a long, central helix, H7. Notably, a short loop replaces the normally highly conserved tubulin interdomain helix, H6. The structure of PhuZ represents the first tubulin homolog in which all of the C-terminal residues have been observed, revealing that they form an extended C-terminal tail (residues 295–315) appended to a long helix, H11. Overlays of the PhuZ backbone structure with those of α-tubulin (Nogales et al., 1998bNogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H.

Wang Q. Michie K.A. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Filament structure of bacterial tubulin homologue TubZ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

G box residues shown as sticks, showing the replacement of the final Gly with a Val residue does not affect the structure. Although the tertiary structure of PhuZ is highly consistent with the structure of other tubulin family members, there are several notable differences. As in tubulins, PhuZ lacks the N-terminal extension present in both FtsZ and TubZ. Surprisingly, H6, which makes key longitudinal contacts in forming tubulin and FtsZ protofilaments (Downing and Nogales, 1998Downing K.H. Nogales E. Tubulin and microtubule structure.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), is missing in PhuZ. The absence of H6 leaves an acidic surface patch in its place (Figure S3D). The PhuZ C-terminal domain is smaller in size than in other tubulin family members due to smaller loops and helices, especially H10. Like TubZ, PhuZ contains a long helix, H11, after the conserved C-terminal domain (Aylett et al., 2010Aylett C.H. Wang Q. Michie K.A. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Filament structure of bacterial tubulin homologue TubZ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 19766-19771Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Ni et al., 2010Ni L. Xu W. Kumaraswami M. Schumacher M.A. Plasmid protein TubR uses a distinct mode of HTH-DNA binding and recruits the prokaryotic tubulin homolog TubZ to effect DNA partition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 11763-11768Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Within the highly conserved nucleotide-binding pocket (Figures 4A and 4B), backbone nitrogen atoms in loops L1 and L4 coordinate the phosphates. Although the GQxG motif in L1 is conserved across eukaryotic tubulins and TubZ, in PhuZ, L1 contains the sequence 11-GGTG-14, replacing the conserved Gln with a Gly, as in FtsZ (Figure 1B). As a consequence, the L1 loop has a tighter turn leading into H1. How this affects nucleotide binding is unclear. The GGGTGT/SG tubulin consensus sequence, or G box, in L4 is also slightly varied to 91-GGGSGSV-97 in PhuZ (Figure 1B), although the presence of the Val side chain does not appear to affect the conserved structural elements (Figure S3). As expected, the nucleotide base pi stacks with Y161 and hydrogen bonds with N16, N155, and N165 (Figure 4B). Residues S89, E122, N126, and Y161, plus two water molecules, all provide hydrogen-bonding interactions with the sugar. These interactions are consistent with the highly conserved nucleotide-binding mode of other tubulins. The catalytic loop, T7, which normally inserts itself into the nucleotide-binding pocket of the preceding longitudinal monomer to aid in GTP hydrolysis, is modified from the GxxNxDxxD/E tubulin/FtsZ consensus sequence to NxxRxDxxD, although the key catalytic DxxD residues are conserved. To confirm the functional assignment of these aspartates, they were separately mutated to alanines. Similar mutations in TubZ and FtsZ compromise GTP hydrolysis but not GTP binding, and as a result, the mutant proteins form long static polymers (Larsen et al., 2007Larsen R.A. Cusumano C. Fujioka A. Lim-Fong G. Patterson P. Pogliano J.

Stricker J. Erickson H.P. Site-specific mutations of FtsZ—effects on GTPase and in vitro assembly.BMC Microbiol. 2001; 1: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). GFP-PhuZD187A (Figure S4A ) and D190A (Figures 2B–2E) mutants were expressed from the arabinose promoter in P. chlororaphis. Both of the mutant proteins behaved similarly and were dramatically different from wild-type. When expressed at low arabinose concentrations at 30°C (0.15%), both of the mutant proteins assembled short polymers in approximately 80% of the cells, suggesting that they had a lower threshold concentration for assembly (Figures 2B, 2E, and S3). There was also no detectable accumulation of diffuse fluorescence in the background of the cells, and a significant percentage of cells (10% for D187A and 18% D190A) assembled filaments even when no arabinose was present, suggesting that even the smallest amount of expressed protein assembled polymers (Figures 2E and S3). When expressed at higher levels (0.4% arabinose), both mutants formed long filaments that often chained the cells together (Figure 2C). In contrast to wild-type filaments, the mutant filaments appeared relatively immobile in time-lapse experiments (Movie S2). We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to quantitate turnover dynamics within these mutant filaments. Unlike wild-type filaments (Figure S4B), no recovery or movement of the bleached zone over time (Figure 2D; Movie S3) was observed in the mutants, even after extended periods, indicating that the filaments are completely static. These results are consistent with an essential role for these two residues for PhuZ GTP hydrolysis and polymerization dynamics. Figure 5A shows PhuZ surrounded by its four symmetry-related molecules in the crystal, revealing two parallel protofilaments, related by 21 crystallographic symmetry. We propose that the intermolecular contacts, especially the longitudinal contacts, observed in the crystal are informative for those made within a PhuZ filament. Like all other tubulin-like proteins, the nucleotide resides at the longitudinal monomer-monomer interface. However, the longitudinal spacing of 47 Å between monomers observed in the crystal lattice is 3–7 Å longer than that of α/β-tubulin (Nogales et al., 1998bNogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Structure of the alpha beta tubulin dimer by electron crystallography.Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), FtsZ (Oliva et al., 2004Oliva M.A. Cordell S.C. Löwe J.

USA. 2010; 107: 19766-19771Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), resulting in the smallest longitudinal interface seen among tubulins. In PhuZ, terminal side-chain atoms of only ten residues in the longitudinal interface lose solvent accessible surface area due to crystal packing, burying only 188 Å2/monomer as compared with typical values of 1,666 and 1,034 Å2 for α/β-tubulin and FtsZ, respectively. Although the gap between monomers is highly solvated, no single water directly contacts the two monomers, and no waters that bridge the two are resolved. This interaction mode is related to, but more extreme than, the one observed for A. aeolicus FtsZ, which has a smaller interaction surface than other FtsZs at 655 Å2 (Oliva et al., 2007Oliva M.A. Trambaiolo D. Löwe J. Structural insights into the conformational variability of FtsZ.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 1229-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In both of these cases, interactions between the intermediate domain of one monomer and H10 of the other are missing. In PhuZ the residues of the catalytic T7 loop do not appear to be positioned correctly for hydrolysis, with the catalytic Asp side chains being displaced by more than 3 Å from where expected if they were to be able to interact with the γ-phosphate. This is likely"
https://openalex.org/W2032657467,"Cellulose degrading enzymes have important functions in the biotechnology industry, including the production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Anaerobes including Clostridium species organize cellulases and other glycosyl hydrolases into large complexes known as cellulosomes. In contrast, aerobic actinobacteria utilize systems comprised of independently acting enzymes, often with carbohydrate binding domains. Numerous actinobacterial genomes have become available through the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA) project. We identified putative cellulose-degrading enzymes belonging to families GH5, GH6, GH8, GH9, GH12, GH48, and GH51 in the genomes of eleven members of the actinobacteria. The eleven organisms were tested in several assays for cellulose degradation, and eight of the organisms showed evidence of cellulase activity. The three with the highest cellulase activity were Actinosynnema mirum, Cellulomonas flavigena, and Xylanimonas cellulosilytica. Cellobiose is known to induce cellulolytic enzymes in the model organism Thermobifida fusca, but only Nocardiopsis dassonvillei showed higher cellulolytic activity in the presence of cellobiose. In T. fusca, cellulases and a putative cellobiose ABC transporter are regulated by the transcriptional regulator CelR. Nine organisms appear to use the CelR site or a closely related binding site to regulate an ABC transporter. In some, CelR also regulates cellulases, while cellulases are controlled by different regulatory sites in three organisms. Mining of genome data for cellulose degradative enzymes followed by experimental verification successfully identified several actinobacteria species which were not previously known to degrade cellulose as cellulolytic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2164619984,"Background Obesity is highly associated with elevated serum triglycerides, hepatic steatosis and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The I148M (rs738409) genetic variant of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 gene (PNPLA3) is known to modulate hepatic triglyceride accumulation, leading to steatosis. No association between PNPLA3 I148M genotype and T2D in Europeans has been reported. Aim of this study is to examine the relationship between PNPLA3 I148M genotypes and serum triglycerides, insulin resistance and T2D susceptibility by testing a gene-environment interaction model with severe obesity. Methods and Findings PNPLA3 I148M was genotyped in a large obese cohort, the SOS study (n = 3,473) and in the Go-DARTS (n = 15,448), a T2D case-control study. Metabolic parameters were examined across the PNPLA3 I148M genotypes in participants of the SOS study at baseline and at 2- and 10-year follow up after bariatric surgery or conventional therapy. The associations with metabolic parameters were validated in the Go-DARTS study. Serum triglycerides were found to be lower in the PNPLA3 148M carriers from the SOS study at baseline and from the Go-DARTS T2D cohort. An increased risk for T2D conferred by the 148M allele was found in the SOS study (O.R. 1.09, 95% C.I. 1.01-1.39, P = 0.040) and in severely obese individuals in the Go-DARTS study (O.R. 1.37, 95% C.I. 1.13-1.66, P = 0.001). The 148M allele was no longer associated with insulin resistance or T2D after bariatric surgery in the SOS study and no association with the 148M allele was observed in the less obese (BMI<35) individuals in the Go-DARTS study (P for interaction = 0.002). This provides evidence for the obesity interaction with I48M allele and T2D risk in a large-scale cross-sectional and a prospective interventional study. Conclusions Severely obese individuals carrying the PNPLA3 148M allele have lower serum triglyceride levels, are more insulin resistant and more susceptible to T2D. This study supports the hypothesis that obesity-driven hepatic lipid accumulation may contribute to T2D susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W1982199134,"Background Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is a rare cause for delayed or absent puberty. These patients may recover from HH spontaneously in adulthood. To date, it is not possible to predict who will undergo HH reversal later in life. Herein we investigated whether Finnish patients with reversal of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) have common phenotypic or genotypic features. Methods and Findings Thirty-two male HH patients with anosmia/hyposmia (Kallmann Syndrome, KS; n = 26) or normal sense of smell (nHH; n = 6) were enrolled (age range, 18–61 yrs). The patients were clinically examined, and reversal of HH was assessed after treatment withdrawal. KAL1, FGFR1, FGF8, PROK2, PROKR2, CHD7, WDR11, GNRHR, GNRH1, KISS1R, KISS1, TAC3, TACR3, and LHβ were screened for mutations. Six HH patients (2 KS, 4 nHH) were verified to have reversal of HH. In the majority of cases, reversal occurred early in adulthood (median age, 23 yrs; range, 21–39 yrs). All had spontaneous testicular growth while on testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). One nHH subject was restarted on TRT due to a decline in serum T. Two reversal variants had a same GNRHR mutation (R262Q), which was accompanied by another GNRHR mutation (R139H or del309F). In addition, both of the KS patients had a mutation in CHD7 (p.Q51X) or FGFR1 (c.91+2T>A). Conclusions Considerable proportion of patients with HH (8% of KS probands) may recover in early adulthood. Spontaneous testicular enlargement during TRT was highly suggestive for reversal of HH. Those with the GNRHR mutation R262Q accompanied by another GNRHR mutation may be prone to reversal, although even patients with a truncating mutation in CHD7 or a splice-site mutation in FGFR1 can recover. We recommend that all adolescents and young adults with congenital HH should be informed on the possibility of reversal."
https://openalex.org/W1964312080,"Axon pruning and synapse elimination promote neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity. Stereotyped pruning of axons that originate in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and extend along the infrapyramidal tract (IPT) occurs during postnatal murine development by neurite retraction and resembles axon repulsion. The chemorepellent Sema3F is required for IPT axon pruning, dendritic spine remodeling, and repulsion of DG axons. The signaling events that regulate IPT axon pruning are not known. We find that inhibition of the small G protein Rac1 by the Rac GTPase-activating protein (GAP) β2-Chimaerin (β2Chn) mediates Sema3F-dependent pruning. The Sema3F receptor neuropilin-2 selectively binds β2Chn, and ligand engagement activates this GAP to ultimately restrain Rac1-dependent effects on cytoskeletal reorganization. β2Chn is necessary for axon pruning both in vitro and in vivo, but it is dispensable for axon repulsion and spine remodeling.

Axon pruning events include two classes based on histological findings: (1) degenerative-like axon collateral elimination in which axon fragmentation is observed and (2) retraction-like pruning, whereby axons draw back without shedding membrane fragments (Luo and O'Leary, 2005Luo L.

However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie axon pruning are poorly understood. A particularly interesting example of retraction-mediated stereotyped pruning involves the hippocampal infrapyramidal tract (IPT), also known as the infrapyramidal bundle (Bagri et al., 2003Bagri A. Cheng H.J. Yaron A. Pleasure S.J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stereotyped pruning of long hippocampal axon branches triggered by retraction inducers of the semaphorin family.Cell. 2003; 113: 285-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). During neural development, the IPT extends parallel to the main bundle (MB) of dentate gyrus mossy fibers. While the MB is directed to the apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons, the IPT axons make synaptic connections with basal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons. During postnatal development, starting between postnatal day 20 (P20) and P30, distal IPT synapses are eliminated and IPT axons retract (Bagri et al., 2003Bagri A. Cheng H.J. Yaron A. Pleasure S.J.

IPT pruning is regulated by the secreted semaphorin ligand Sema3F and its receptor complex, which includes neuropilin 2 (Npn-2) and plexin A3 (PlexA3) proteins (Bagri et al., 2003Bagri A. Cheng H.J.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6671-6680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this signaling pathway is well known for serving key roles in central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) axon guidance events during neural development (Tran et al., 2007Tran T.S. Kolodkin A.L. Bharadwaj R. Semaphorin regulation of cellular morphology.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 263-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). A role for reverse ephrin-B signaling in IPT pruning has also been described (Xu and Henkemeyer, 2009Xu N.J. Henkemeyer M. Ephrin-B3 reverse signaling through Grb4 and cytoskeletal regulators mediates axon pruning.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although axon pruning in the vertebrate hippocampus superficially resembles axonal repulsion, the degree of similarity between mechanisms that underlie axon pruning and repulsion remains to be elucidated. For example, do the same cytoplasmic effectors mediate axon pruning and guidance? Here, we show that repulsive axon guidance and stereotypical axonal pruning elicited by the same guidance cue result from the employment of distinct signaling mechanisms, shedding light on fundamental differences between unique modes of inhibitory influences on neuronal processes during postnatal neural development. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying hippocampal IPT axon pruning, we first asked whether Rac, a small GTPase with established roles in the regulation of neuronal morphology, axon guidance, and actin remodeling (Hall and Lalli, 2010Hall A. Lalli G. Rho and Ras GTPases in axon growth, guidance, and branching.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a001818Crossref Scopus (315) Google Scholar), is modulated by Sema3F. Treatment of either DIV14 hippocampal primary neuronal cultures or a neuroblastoma cell line that expresses Sema3F receptor components (Neuro2A cells; Figure S1A available online) with 10 nM Sema3F results in a significant decrease in the levels of activated Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) detected in cell lysates, as compared to alkaline phosphatase (AP) control treatment (Figures S1B and S1C; p = 0.0031 and p = 0.016 for Neuro2A cells and cultured hippocampal neurons, respectively). To assess Sema3F effects on the axonal pool of Rac1-GTP, we performed immunocytochemical detection of Rac/Cdc42-GTP using the p21-binding domain (PBD) of p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) (Harrington et al., 2011Harrington A.W. St Hillaire C. Zweifel L.S. Glebova N.O. Philippidou P. Halegoua S. Ginty D.D.

We observed a striking reduction of activated Rac/Cdc42 in axons when cultured hippocampal neurons were treated with Sema3F (Figures 1A–1C and S1D; p = 0.0008). Taken together, these Rho-GTPase pull-down and immunocytochemical assays suggest that Sema3F negatively regulates Rac1-GTP levels.Figure 1Downregulation of Rac-GTP Levels Is Required for Infrapyramidal Tract PruningShow full caption(A and B) Immunostaining of DIV14 hippocampal neurons treated with 10 nM AP-control (A) or Sema3F-AP (B) by using GST-PAK1 (top, green; middle, white) and Tau1 (top, red).

Yellow arrows mark presynaptic vGlut1+ terminals present in RacQL-ires-EGFP-expressing distal IPT axons (I). Scale bar, 50 μm. To determine whether Sema3F-mediated reduction in Rac-GTP levels is required in vivo for IPT pruning, we stereotactically injected dentate gyri of P20 mice with lentivirus vectors that encode either a constitutively active form of Rac1 (RacQL) under the control of the ubiquitin promoter followed by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or EGFP alone. This strategy results in robust expression of these transgenes in the dentate gyrus and produces strong labeling of most mossy fiber axons at P45 (Figure 1F). IPT pruning occurs normally in mice injected with the control EGFP-expressing lentivirus, with green-fluorescent-protein-positive (GFP+) axons in the IPT retracting to 47% of the main mossy fiber bundle length at P45 (Figure 1D). However, GFP+ IPT axons in hippocampi of mice injected with the RacQL-expressing lentivirus extend 78% of the main mossy fiber bundle length at P45 (Figures 1E and 1G). This defect in IPT retraction following expression of RacQL suggests that Rac inhibition is required for IPT pruning. Because previous work shows that synapses are present in the distal unpruned IPT of Npn2−/− and PlexinA3−/− mutant mice (Liu et al., 2005Liu X.B. Low L.K. Jones E.G. Cheng H.J. Stereotyped axon pruning via plexin signaling is associated with synaptic complex elimination in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9124-9134Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we immunostained mice injected with the lentivirus expressing RacQL or the control lentivirus with the presynaptic marker vGlut1 to investigate whether Rac inhibition is also required for dissolution of presynaptic specializations. Interestingly, expression of RacQL in the dentate gyrus results in strong vGlut1 staining in distal GFP+ IPT axons that is not observed in EGFP-expressing control-injected mice (Figures 1H and 1I). These results suggest that Rac inhibition is necessary for the elimination of IPT presynaptic components and axon pruning. Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) play key roles in guidance cue signaling and axonal pruning (Bashaw and Klein, 2010Bashaw G.J. Klein R. Signaling from axon guidance receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a001941Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Billuart et al., 2001Billuart P. Winter C.G. Maresh A. Zhao X. Luo L.

We took a candidate approach to investigate the identity of Rac-GAPs with the potential to inhibit Rac in response to Sema3F signaling during IPT pruning, and we found that the Rac-GAP β2-Chimaerin (β2Chn) robustly binds to Npn2, the ligand-binding component of the Sema3F holoreceptor complex (Figure 2A ). We performed coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments to investigate whether both members of the small chimaerin protein family, α2- or β2-chimaerin, bind to Npn-2. Though α2-chimaerin (αChn) also exhibits binding to Npn-2, it is at least ∼5-fold weaker than β2Chn when normalized to input (Figures 2A and S2A). Weak binding of β2Chn to PlexinA3 was also detected (Figure S2A ).Figure S2β2-Chimaerin Binds Preferentially and Robustly to Npn-2 and Is Expressed in the DG, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Weak binding of α2-Chimaerin to Npn-2, and of β2-Chimaerin to PlexA3, as revealed only after a longer exposure of the same Western blot presented in Figure 2A.(B and C) βChn hippocampal expression during postnatal development assessed by in situ hybridization using β-Chimaerin antisense (C) and sense control (B) probes at various postnatal (P) stages, demonstrating that βChn is expressed in the DG when the IPT is pruned.

Neurosci. 2011; 15: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and, when overexpressed in vitro, induces dendritic pruning of dissociated hippocampal neurons (Buttery et al., 2006Buttery P. Beg A.A. Chih B. Broder A. Mason C.A. Scheiffele P. The diacylglycerol-binding protein alpha1-chimaerin regulates dendritic morphology.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 1924-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); however, the role of βChn during neural development is unknown. Because Npn-2 binds robustly to β2Chn, we asked whether Sema3F modulates β2Chn activity. We performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments by using a previously characterized β2Chn-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)/Rac1-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) probe pair that allows for direct assessment of β2Chn activation and recruitment to the cell membrane (Wang et al., 2006Wang H. Yang C. Leskow F.C. Sun J. Canagarajah B. Hurley J.H. Kazanietz M.G. Phospholipase Cgamma/diacylglycerol-dependent activation of beta2-chimaerin restricts EGF-induced Rac signaling.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2062-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). Neuro2a cells expressing these fluorescent probes were treated with 10 nM Sema3F-AP or AP-control (Figures 2C and 2D). Though addition of control AP ligand elicits no change in FRET, treatment with Sema3F triggers a robust increase in Rac1-β2Chn interaction at the cell membrane (p < 0.0001) with no change in cytosolic FRET (Figures 2C–2E). These results demonstrate that Sema3F can induce β2Chn activation. To begin to address how Sema3F achieves this, we examined whether Sema3F regulates binding of β2Chn to Npn-2. Bath application of Sema3F onto Neuro2A cells for 20 min causes a significant reduction in the association of β2Chn with Npn-2 (Figure 2F), suggesting that Sema3F activation of β2Chn includes promotion of β2Chn release from Npn-2 to facilitate its activation at the cell membrane. We next assessed the βChn temporal and spatial expression patterns during hippocampal postnatal development by using RNA in situ hybridization. At early postnatal stages, starting at P1, weak expression of βChn is observed in the dentate gyrus. However, transcript levels progressively increase and peak between P20 and P45 (Figures 2G and S2). Thus, the timing of peak βChn expression in the dentate gyrus overlaps with IPT pruning. To test whether or not βChn, which is encoded by the Chn2 gene, is required for Sema3F-induced inhibition of RacGTP levels, we performed immunocytochemical detection of activated Rac/Cdc42 on wild-type (WT) and Chn2−/− hippocampal cultures acutely treated with Sema3F (Figures 3A–3D ). Chn2−/− hippocampal neurons were derived from a newly generated Chn2−/− null mutant mouse (Figure S3). In contrast to the dramatic reduction in glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PAK1-PBD staining following Sema3F treatment that we observed in WT-cultured hippocampal neurons (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3E), Chn2−/− neurons show no decrease in activated Rac/Cdc42 upon Sema3F treatment (Figures 3C–3E). Because βChn is a GAP that acts specifically on Rac and does not affect the GTPase activity of Rho or Cdc42 (Yang and Kazanietz, 2007Yang C. Kazanietz M.G. Chimaerins: GAPs that bridge diacylglycerol signalling and the small G-protein Rac.Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), our data demonstrate that β2Chn is required for Sema3F-dependent inhibition of Rac-GTP levels and does not significantly affect levels of activated Cdc42.Figure S3Generation of the Targeted Chn2 Deletion Allele, Related to Figures 3 and 4Show full caption(A) Chn2 gene targeting strategy.

We used an in vitro assay to address this issue. One of the first steps in IPT pruning is the disruption of previously established synaptic connections between dentate gyrus mossy fiber axons and basal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons (Liu et al., 2005Liu X.B.

https://openalex.org/W2096798850,"Laboratories around the world have produced tens of thousands of mutant and transgenic zebrafish lines. As with mice, maintaining all of these valuable zebrafish genotypes is expensive, risky, and beyond the capacity of even the largest stock centers. Because reducing oxidative stress has become an important aspect of reducing the variability in mouse sperm cryopreservation, we examined whether antioxidants might improve cryopreservation of zebrafish sperm. Four experiments were conducted in this study. First, we used the xanthine-xanthine oxidase (X-XO) system to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The X-XO system was capable of producing a stress reaction in zebrafish sperm reducing its sperm motility in a concentration dependent manner (P<0.05). Second, we examined X-XO and the impact of antioxidants on sperm viability, ROS and motility. Catalase (CAT) mitigated stress and maintained viability and sperm motility (P>0.05), whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD) and vitamin E did not (P<0.05). Third, we evaluated ROS in zebrafish spermatozoa during cryopreservation and its effect on viability and motility. Methanol (8%) reduced viability and sperm motility (P<0.05), but the addition of CAT mitigated these effects (P>0.05), producing a mean 2.0 to 2.9-fold increase in post-thaw motility. Fourth, we examined the effect of additional cryoprotectants and CAT on fresh sperm motility. Cryoprotectants, 8% methanol and 10% dimethylacetamide (DMA), reduced the motility over the control value (P<0.5), whereas 10% dimethylformamide (DMF) with or without CAT did not (P>0.05). Zebrafish sperm protocols should be modified to improve the reliability of the cryopreservation process, perhaps using a different cryoprotectant. Regardless, the simple addition of CAT to present-day procedures will significantly improve this process, assuring increased and less variable fertilization success and allowing resource managers to dependably plan how many straws are needed to safely cryopreserve a genetic line."
https://openalex.org/W2052412319,"In this study, we utilize a special visual stimulation protocol, called motion reversal, to present a novel steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP)-based BCI paradigm that relied on human perception of motions oscillated in two opposite directions. Four Newton's rings with the oscillating expansion and contraction motions served as visual stimulators to elicit subjects' SSMVEPs. And four motion reversal frequencies of 8.1, 9.8, 12.25 and 14 Hz were tested. According to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), the offline accuracy and ITR (mean ± standard deviation) over six healthy subjects were 86.56±9.63% and 15.93±3.83 bits/min, respectively. All subjects except one exceeded the level of 80% mean accuracy. Circular Hotelling's T-Squared test () also demonstrated that most subjects exhibited significantly strong stimulus-locked SSMVEP responses. The results of declining exponential fittings exhibited low-adaptation characteristics over the 100-s stimulation sequences in most experimental conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that the proposed paradigm can provide comparable performance with low-adaptation characteristic and less visual discomfort for BCI applications."
https://openalex.org/W1981608517,"Chlamydia pneumoniae commonly causes respiratory tract infections in children, and epidemiological investigations strongly link infection to the pathogenesis of asthma. The immune system in early life is immature and may not respond appropriately to pathogens. Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and 4 are regarded as the primary pattern recognition receptors that sense bacteria, however their contribution to innate and adaptive immunity in early life remains poorly defined. We investigated the role of TLR2 and 4 in the induction of immune responses to Chlamydia muridarum respiratory infection, in neonatal wild-type (Wt) or TLR2-deficient ((-/-)), 4(-/-) or 2/4(-/-) BALB/c mice. Wt mice had moderate disease and infection. TLR2(-/-) mice had more severe disease and more intense and prolonged infection compared to other groups. TLR4(-/-) mice were asymptomatic. TLR2/4(-/-) mice had severe early disease and persistent infection, which resolved thereafter consistent with the absence of symptoms in TLR4(-/-) mice. Wt mice mounted robust innate and adaptive responses with an influx of natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells, and activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells into the lungs. Wt mice also had effective production of interferon (IFN)γ in the lymph nodes and lung, and proliferation of lymph node T-cells. TLR2(-/-) mice had more intense and persistent innate (particularly neutrophil) and adaptive cell responses and IL-17 expression in the lung, however IFNγ responses and T-cell proliferation were reduced. TLR2/4(-/-) mice had reduced innate and adaptive responses. Most importantly, neutrophil phagocytosis was impaired in the absence of TLR2. Thus, TLR2 expression, particularly on neutrophils, is required for effective control of Chlamydia respiratory infection in early life. Loss of control of infection leads to enhanced but ineffective TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses that prolong disease symptoms. This indicates that TLR2 agonists may be beneficial in the treatment of early life Chlamydia infections and associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2044629789,"Mutations in the fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma gene (FUS/TLS, FUS) have been identified in sporadic and familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). FUS is an RNA-binding protein that is normally localized in the nucleus, but is mislocalized to the cytoplasm in ALS, and comprises cytoplasmic inclusions in ALS-affected areas. However, it is still unknown whether the neurodegeneration that occurs in ALS is caused by the loss of FUS nuclear function, or by the gain of toxic function due to cytoplasmic FUS aggregation. Cabeza (Caz) is a Drosophila orthologue of human FUS. Here, we generated Drosophila models with Caz knockdown, and investigated their phenotypes. In wild-type Drosophila, Caz was strongly expressed in the central nervous system of larvae and adults. Caz did not colocalize with a presynaptic marker, suggesting that Caz physiologically functions in neuronal cell bodies and/or their axons. Fly models with neuron-specific Caz knockdown exhibited reduced climbing ability in adulthood and anatomical defects in presynaptic terminals of motoneurons in third instar larvae. Our results demonstrated that decreased expression of Drosophila Caz is sufficient to cause degeneration of motoneurons and locomotive disability in the absence of abnormal cytoplasmic Caz aggregates, suggesting that the pathogenic mechanism underlying FUS-related ALS should be ascribed more to the loss of physiological FUS functions in the nucleus than to the toxicity of cytoplasmic FUS aggregates. Since the Caz-knockdown Drosophila model we presented recapitulates key features of human ALS, it would be a suitable animal model for the screening of genes and chemicals that might modify the pathogenic processes that lead to the degeneration of motoneurons in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2133710762,"Memory is created by several interlinked processes in the brain, some of which require long-term gene regulation. Epigenetic mechanisms are likely candidates for regulating memory-related genes. Among these, DNA methylation is known to be a long lasting genomic mark and may be involved in the establishment of long-term memory. Here we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferases, which induce and maintain DNA methylation, are involved in a particular aspect of associative long-term memory formation in honeybees, but are not required for short-term memory formation. While long-term memory strength itself was not affected by blocking DNA methyltransferases, odor specificity of the memory (memory discriminatory power) was. Conversely, perceptual discriminatory power was normal. These results suggest that different genetic pathways are involved in mediating the strength and discriminatory power of associative odor memories and provide, to our knowledge, the first indication that DNA methyltransferases are involved in stimulus-specific associative long-term memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2037147101,"Spatial variation in growth is a common feature of demersal fish populations which often exist as discrete adult sub-populations linked by a pelagic larval stage. However, it remains unclear whether variation in growth occurs at similar spatial scales for populations of highly migratory pelagic species, such as tuna. We examined spatial variation in growth of albacore Thunnus alalunga across 90° of longitude in the South Pacific Ocean from the east coast of Australia to the Pitcairn Islands. Using length-at-age data from a validated ageing method we found evidence for significant variation in length-at-age and growth parameters (L∞ and k) between sexes and across longitudes. Growth trajectories were similar between sexes up until four years of age, after which the length-at-age for males was, on average, greater than that for females. Males reached an average maximum size more than 8 cm larger than females. Length-at-age and growth parameters were consistently greater at more easterly longitudes than at westerly longitudes for both females and males. Our results provide strong evidence that finer spatial structure exists within the South Pacific albacore stock and raises the question of whether the scale of their “highly migratory” nature should be re-assessed. Future stock assessment models for South Pacific albacore should consider sex-specific growth curves and spatial variation in growth within the stock."

Two water molecules per N-acetylglucosamine residue are clearly localized in the structure and these participate in most of the hydrogen bonds. The conformation of the labile acetamide groups and hydroxymethyl groups are similar to those found in anhydrous β-chitin, but more relaxed. Unexpectedly, the intrachain O3-H…O5 hydrogen bond typically observed for crystalline β,1–4 glycans is absent, providing important insights into its relative importance and its relationship to solvation."
https://openalex.org/W2135397815,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is amongst the deadliest of human cancers, due to its late diagnosis as well as its intense resistance to currently available therapeutics. To identify mechanisms as to why PDAC are refractory to DNA damaging cytoxic chemotherapy and radiation, we performed a global interrogation of the DNA damage response of PDAC. We find that PDAC cells generally harbor high levels of spontaneous DNA damage. Inhibition of Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) repair either pharmacologically or by RNAi resulted in a further accumulation of DNA damage, inhibition of growth, and ultimately apoptosis even in the absence of exogenous DNA damaging agents. In response to radiation, PDAC cells rely on the NHEJ pathway to rapidly repair DNA double strand breaks. Mechanistically, when NHEJ is inhibited there is a compensatory increase in Homologous Recombination (HR). Despite this upregulation of HR, DNA damage persists and cells are significantly more sensitive to radiation. Together, these findings support the incorporation of NHEJ inhibition into PDAC therapeutic approaches, either alone, or in combination with DNA damaging therapies such as radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2003880148,"The fou8 loss of function allele of adenosine bisphosphate phosphatase FIERY1 results in numerous phenotypes including the increased enzymatic oxygenation of fatty acids and increased jasmonate synthesis. Here we show that the mutation causes also profound alterations of sulfur metabolism. The fou8 mutants possess lower levels of sulfated secondary compounds, glucosinolates, and accumulate the desulfo-precursors similar to previously described mutants in adenosine 5'phosphosulfate kinase. Transcript levels of genes involved in sulfate assimilation differ in fou8 compared to wild type Col-0 plants and are similar to plants subjected to sulfate deficiency. Indeed, independent microarray analyses of various alleles of mutants in FIERY1 showed similar patterns of gene expression as in sulfate deficient plants. This was not caused by alterations in signalling, as the fou8 mutants contained significantly lower levels of sulfate and glutathione and, consequently, of total elemental sulfur. Analysis of mutants with altered levels of sulfate and glutathione confirmed the correlation of sulfate deficiency-like gene expression pattern with low internal sulfate but not low glutathione. The changes in sulfur metabolism in fou8 correlated with massive increases in 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate levels. The analysis of fou8 thus revealed that sulfate starvation response is triggered by a decrease in internal sulfate as opposed to external sulfate availability and that the presence of desulfo-glucosinolates does not induce the glucosinolate synthesis network. However, as well as resolving these important questions on the regulation of sulfate assimilation in plants, fou8 has also opened an array of new questions on the links between jasmonate synthesis and sulfur metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1974697414,"CTCF is a ubiquitous epigenetic regulator that has been proposed as a master keeper of chromatin organisation. CTCF-like, or BORIS, is thought to antagonise CTCF and has been found in normal testis, ovary and a large variety of tumour cells. The cellular function of BORIS remains intriguing although it might be involved in developmental reprogramming of gene expression patterns. We here unravel the expression of CTCF and BORIS proteins throughout human epidermis. While CTCF is widely distributed within the nucleus, BORIS is confined to the nucleolus and other euchromatin domains. Nascent RNA experiments in primary keratinocytes revealed that endogenous BORIS is present in active transcription sites. Interestingly, BORIS also localises to interphase centrosomes suggesting a role in the cell cycle. Blocking the cell cycle at S phase or mitosis, or causing DNA damage, produced a striking accumulation of BORIS. Consistently, ectopic expression of wild type or GFP- BORIS provoked a higher rate of S phase cells as well as genomic instability by mitosis failure. Furthermore, down-regulation of endogenous BORIS by specific shRNAs inhibited both RNA transcription and cell cycle progression. The results altogether suggest a role for BORIS in coordinating S phase events with mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2043319863,"Catecholaminergic (CA) neurons innervate sensory areas and affect the processing of sensory signals. For example, in birds, CA fibers innervate the auditory pathway at each level, including the midbrain, thalamus, and forebrain. We have shown previously that in female European starlings, CA activity in the auditory forebrain can be enhanced by exposure to attractive male song for one week. It is not known, however, whether hearing song can initiate that activity more rapidly. Here, we exposed estrogen-primed, female white-throated sparrows to conspecific male song and looked for evidence of rapid synthesis of catecholamines in auditory areas. In one hemisphere of the brain, we used immunohistochemistry to detect the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in the CA synthetic pathway. We found that immunoreactivity for TH phosphorylated at serine 40 increased dramatically in the auditory forebrain, but not the auditory thalamus and midbrain, after 15 min of song exposure. In the other hemisphere, we used high pressure liquid chromatography to measure catecholamines and their metabolites. We found that two dopamine metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, increased in the auditory forebrain but not the auditory midbrain after 30 min of exposure to conspecific song. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to a behaviorally relevant auditory stimulus rapidly induces CA activity, which may play a role in auditory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2087133966,"Background Chloroquine (CQ)-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been a global health catastrophe, yet much about the CQ resistance (CQR) mechanism remains unclear. Hallmarks of the CQR phenotype include reduced accumulation of protonated CQ as a weak base in the digestive vacuole of the erythrocyte-stage parasite, and chemosensitization of CQ-resistant (but not CQ-sensitive) P. falciparum by agents such as verapamil. Mutations in the P. falciparum CQR transporter (PfCRT) confer CQR; particularly important among these mutations is the charge-loss substitution K→T at position 76. Dictyostelium discoideum transformed with mutant PfCRT expresses key features of CQR including reduced drug accumulation and verapamil chemosensitization. Methodology and Findings We describe the isolation and characterization of PfCRT-transformed, hematin-free vesicles from D. discoideum cells. These vesicles permit assessments of drug accumulation, pH, and membrane potential that are difficult or impossible with hematin-containing digestive vacuoles from P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Mutant PfCRT-transformed D. discoideum vesicles show features of the CQR phenotype, and manipulations of vesicle membrane potential by agents including ionophores produce large changes of CQ accumulation that are dissociated from vesicular pH. PfCRT in its native or mutant form blunts the ability of valinomycin to reduce CQ accumulation in transformed vesicles and decreases the ability of K+ to reverse membrane potential hyperpolarization caused by valinomycin treatment. Conclusion Isolated vesicles from mutant-PfCRT-transformed D. discoideum exhibit features of the CQR phenotype, consistent with evidence that the drug resistance mechanism operates at the P. falciparum digestive vacuole membrane in malaria. Membrane potential apart from pH has a major effect on the PfCRT-mediated CQR phenotype of D. discoideum vesicles. These results support a model of PfCRT as an electrochemical potential-driven transporter in the drug/metabolite superfamily that (appropriately mutated) acts as a saturable simple carrier for the facilitated diffusion of protonated CQ."
https://openalex.org/W2094496417,"Background Osteoporosis is a bone disorder associated with loss of bone mineral density and micro architecture. A balance of osteoblasts and osteoclasts activities maintains bone homeostasis. Increased bone loss due to increased osteoclast and decreased osteoblast activities is considered as an underlying cause of osteoporosis. Methods and Findings The cures for osteoporosis are limited, consequently the potential of CD34+ cell therapies is currently being considered. We developed a nanofiber-based expansion technology to obtain adequate numbers of CD34+ cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood, for therapeutic applications. Herein, we show that CD34+ cells could be differentiated into osteoblastic lineage, in vitro. Systemically delivered CD34+ cells home to the bone marrow and significantly improve bone deposition, bone mineral density and bone micro-architecture in osteoporotic mice. The elevated levels of osteocalcin, IL-10, GM-CSF, and decreased levels of MCP-1 in serum parallel the improvements in bone micro-architecture. Furthermore, CD34+ cells improved osteoblast activity and concurrently impaired osteoclast differentiation, maturation and functionality. Conclusions These findings demonstrate a novel approach utilizing nanofiber-expanded CD34+ cells as a therapeutic application for the treatment of osteoporosis."

However, no direct link between RABV and human disease has been definitively established and the extent to which RABV utilizes the typical WNV transmission cycle is unknown. Herein, we evaluated vector competence and capacity for vertical transmission (VT) in Cx. pipiens; in vitro growth on avian, mammalian, and mosquito cells; and infectivity and viremia production in birds. RABV infection and replication only were detected on mosquito cells. Experimentally inoculated birds did not become infected. Cx. pipiens had poor peroral vector competence and a higher VT rate as compared to US-WNV in Cx. pipiens. As a result, we postulate that RABV is an intermediate between the mosquito-specific and horizontally transmitted flaviviruses."
https://openalex.org/W1980237004,"To investigate obesity prevention support in the German general public and to assess determinants of general prevention support as well as support of specific prevention measures.This study was a cross-sectional analysis of a telephone based representative German study (3,003 subjects (52.8% women, mean age 51.9, s.d. = 18.0, range 18-97 years). Likert scale-based questions on general prevention support and support of specific measures were used. Furthermore willingness to take part in preventive programs and willingness to pay were assessed. Stigmatizing attitudes were assessed with the Fat Phobia Scale (FPS). Causation of obesity was differentiated in three dimensions (internal, e.g. lack of exercise; external, e.g. social surroundings; and genetic factors).Obesity prevention was perceived as possible (98.2%), however, almost exclusively lifestyle changes were named. Participants with higher stigmatizing attitudes were less likely to believe obesity prevention is possible. The majority of participants would take part in preventive programs (59.6%) and pay at least partially themselves (86.9%). Factor analysis revealed three dimensions of preventive measures: promoting healthy eating, restrictive and financial, governmental prevention efforts. In regard to these, promoting healthy eating was the most supported measure. Higher age, female gender and external causation were associated with higher support for all three dimensions of preventive measures. Only for governmental regulation, higher age was associated with lower support.Obesity prevention support in Germany is high. Structural prevention efforts are supported by the majority of the general public in Germany. The vast majority proclaims willingness to pay themselves for programs of weight gain prevention. This could be an indication of higher perceived self-responsibility in the German system but also for risen ""fear of fat"" in the population due to media coverage. For Germany, the government and communities ought to be encouraged by these results to start the implementation of structural obesity prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2057529084,"Malarial pigment (natural haemozoin, HZ) is a ferriprotoporphyrin IX crystal produced by Plasmodium parasites after haemoglobin catabolism. HZ-fed human monocytes are functionally compromised, releasing increased amounts of pro-inflammatory molecules, including cytokines, chemokines and cytokine-related proteolytic enzyme Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), whose role in complicated malaria has been recently suggested. In a previous work HZ was shown to induce through TNFalpha production the release of monocytic lysozyme, an enzyme stored in gelatinase granules with MMP-9. Here, the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Results showed that HZ lipid moiety promoted early but not late lysozyme release. HZ-dependent lysozyme induction was abrogated by anti-TNFalpha/IL-1 beta/MIP-1 alpha blocking antibodies and mimicked by recombinant cytokines. Moreover, HZ early activated either p38 MAPK or NF-kappaB pathways by inducing: p38 MAPK phosphorylation; cytosolic I-kappaB alpha phosphorylation and degradation; NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and DNA-binding. Inhibition of both routes through selected molecules (SB203580, quercetin, artemisinin, parthenolide) prevented HZ-dependent lysozyme release. These data suggest that HZ-triggered overproduction of TNFalpha, IL-1 beta and MIP-1 alpha mediates induction of lysozyme release from human monocytes through activation of p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways, providing new evidence on mechanisms underlying the HZ-enhanced monocyte degranulation in falciparum malaria and the potential role for lysozyme as a new affordable marker in severe malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2065383010,"Background Vectorial capacity and the basic reproductive number (R0) have been instrumental in structuring thinking about vector-borne pathogen transmission and how best to prevent the diseases they cause. One of the more important simplifying assumptions of these models is age-independent vector mortality. A growing body of evidence indicates that insect vectors exhibit age-dependent mortality, which can have strong and varied affects on pathogen transmission dynamics and strategies for disease prevention. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on survival analysis we derived new equations for vectorial capacity and R0 that are valid for any pattern of age-dependent (or age–independent) vector mortality and explore the behavior of the models across various mortality patterns. The framework we present (1) lays the groundwork for an extension and refinement of the vectorial capacity paradigm by introducing an age-structured extension to the model, (2) encourages further research on the actuarial dynamics of vectors in particular and the relationship of vector mortality to pathogen transmission in general, and (3) provides a detailed quantitative basis for understanding the relative impact of reductions in vector longevity compared to other vector-borne disease prevention strategies. Conclusions/Significance Accounting for age-dependent vector mortality in estimates of vectorial capacity and R0 was most important when (1) vector densities are relatively low and the pattern of mortality can determine whether pathogen transmission will persist; i.e., determines whether R0 is above or below 1, (2) vector population growth rate is relatively low and there are complex interactions between birth and death that differ fundamentally from birth-death relationships with age-independent mortality, and (3) the vector exhibits complex patterns of age-dependent mortality and R0∼1. A limiting factor in the construction and evaluation of new age-dependent mortality models is the paucity of data characterizing vector mortality patterns, particularly for free ranging vectors in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2069910243,"Covariation analysis is used to identify those positions with similar patterns of sequence variation in an alignment of RNA sequences. These constraints on the evolution of two positions are usually associated with a base pair in a helix. While mutual information (MI) has been used to accurately predict an RNA secondary structure and a few of its tertiary interactions, early studies revealed that phylogenetic event counting methods are more sensitive and provide extra confidence in the prediction of base pairs. We developed a novel and powerful phylogenetic events counting method (PEC) for quantifying positional covariation with the Gutell lab's new RNA Comparative Analysis Database (rCAD). The PEC and MI-based methods each identify unique base pairs, and jointly identify many other base pairs. In total, both methods in combination with an N-best and helix-extension strategy identify the maximal number of base pairs. While covariation methods have effectively and accurately predicted RNAs secondary structure, only a few tertiary structure base pairs have been identified. Analysis presented herein and at the Gutell lab's Comparative RNA Web (CRW) Site reveal that the majority of these latter base pairs do not covary with one another. However, covariation analysis does reveal a weaker although significant covariation between sets of nucleotides that are in proximity in the three-dimensional RNA structure. This reveals that covariation analysis identifies other types of structural constraints beyond the two nucleotides that form a base pair."

However, it is unclear which cardiovascular risk factors tend to cluster predominately and how individual risk factor states change over time.We used data from 3,187 individuals aged 20-79 years from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania for a network-based approach to visualize clustered MetS risk factor states and their change over a five-year follow-up period. MetS was defined by harmonized Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, and each individual's risk factor burden was classified according to the five MetS components at baseline and follow-up. We used the map generator to depict 32 (2(5)) different states and highlight the most important transitions between the 1,024 (32(2)) possible states in the weighted directed network. At baseline, we found the largest fraction (19.3%) of all individuals free of any MetS risk factors and identified hypertension (15.4%) and central obesity (6.3%), as well as their combination (19.0%), as the most common MetS risk factors. Analyzing risk factor flow over the five-year follow-up, we found that most individuals remained in their risk factor state and that low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (6.3%) was the most prominent additional risk factor beyond hypertension and central obesity. Also among individuals without any MetS risk factor at baseline, low HDL (3.5%), hypertension (2.1%), and central obesity (1.6%) were the first risk factors to manifest during follow-up.We identified hypertension and central obesity as the predominant MetS risk factor cluster and low HDL concentrations as the most prominent new onset risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W1977856230,"Pterygium is a lesion of the eye surface which involves cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and extracellular matrix remodelling. Surgery is the only approved method to treat this disorder, but high recurrence rates are common. Recently, it has been shown in a mouse model that treatment with doxycycline resulted in reduction of the pterygium lesions. Here we study the mechanism(s) of action by which doxycycline achieves these results, using massive sequencing techniques. Surgically removed pterygia from 10 consecutive patients were set in short term culture and exposed to 0 (control), 50, 200, and 500 µg/ml doxycycline for 24 h, their mRNA was purified, reverse transcribed and sequenced through Illumina’s massive sequencing protocols. Acquired data were subjected to quantile normalization and analyzed using cytoscape plugin software to explore the pathways involved. False discovery rate (FDR) methods were used to identify 332 genes which modified their expression in a dose-dependent manner upon exposure to doxycycline. The more represented cellular pathways included all mitochondrial genes, the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, integrins and extracellular matrix components, and growth factors. A high correlation was obtained when comparing ultrasequencing data with qRT-PCR and ELISA results. Doxycycline significantly modified the expression of important cellular pathways in pterygium cells, in a way which is consistent with the observed efficacy of this antibiotic to reduce pterygium lesions in a mouse model.

https://openalex.org/W2094445874,"Background Ecological replacement involves the introduction of non-native species to habitats beyond their historical range, a factor identified as increasing the risk of failure for translocations. Yet the effectiveness and success of ecological replacement rely in part on the ability of translocatees to adapt, survive and potentially reproduce in a novel environment. We discuss the welfare aspects of translocating captive-reared non-native tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea and Astrochelys radiata, to two offshore Mauritian islands, and the costs and success of the projects to date. Methodology/Principal Findings Because tortoises are long-lived, late-maturing reptiles, we assessed the progress of the translocation by monitoring the survival, health, growth, and breeding by the founders. Between 2000 and 2011, a total of 26 A. gigantea were introduced to Ile aux Aigrettes, and in 2007 twelve sexually immature A. gigantea and twelve male A. radiata were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius. Annual mortality rates were low, with most animals either maintaining or gaining weight. A minimum of 529 hatchlings were produced on Ile aux Aigrettes in 11 years; there was no potential for breeding on Round Island. Project costs were low. We attribute the success of these introductions to the tortoises’ generalist diet, habitat requirements, and innate behaviour. Conclusions/Significance Feasibility analyses for ecological replacement and assisted colonisation projects should consider the candidate species’ welfare during translocation and in its recipient environment. Our study provides a useful model for how this should be done. In addition to serving as ecological replacements for extinct Mauritian tortoises, we found that releasing small numbers of captive-reared A. gigantea and A. radiata is cost-effective and successful in the short term. The ability to release small numbers of animals is a particularly important attribute for ecological replacement projects since it reduces the potential risk and controversy associated with introducing non-native species."
https://openalex.org/W2110942903,"CD31, an immunoglobulin-like molecule expressed by leukocytes and endothelial cells, is thought to contribute to the physiological regulation T cell homeostasis due to the presence of two immunotyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in its cytoplasmic tail. Indeed, loss of CD31 expression leads to uncontrolled T cell-mediated inflammation in a variety of experimental models of disease and certain CD31 polymorphisms correlate with increased disease severity in human graft-versus-host disease and atherosclerosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying CD31-mediated regulation of T cell responses have not yet been clarified. We here show that CD31-mediated signals attenuate T cell chemokinesis both in vitro and in vivo. This effect selectively affects activated/memory T lymphocytes, in which CD31 is clustered on the cell membrane where it segregates to the leading edge. We provide evidence that this molecular segregation, which does not occur in naïve T lymphocytes, might lead to cis-CD31 engagement on the same membrane and subsequent interference with the chemokine-induced PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. We propose that CD31-mediated modulation of memory T cell chemokinesis is a key mechanism by which this molecule contributes to the homeostatic regulation of effector T cell immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1972466905,"Introduction Basophil has been implicated in anti-parasite defense, allergy and in polarizing TH2 response. Mouse model has been commonly used to study basophil function although the difference between human and mouse basophils is underappreciated. As an essential chaperone for multiple Toll-like receptors and integrins in the endoplasmic reticulum, gp96 also participates in general protein homeostasis and in the ER unfolded protein response to ensure cell survival during stress. The roles of gp96 in basophil development are unknown. Methods We genetically delete gp96 in mice and examined the expression of gp96 in basophils by Western blot and flow cytometry. We compared the expression pattern of gp96 between human and mouse basophils. Results We found that gp96 was dispensable for murine basophil development. Moreover, gp96 was cleaved by serine protease(s) in murine but not human basophils leading to accumulation of a nun-functional N-terminal ∼50 kDa fragment and striking induction of the unfolded protein response. The alteration of gp96 was unique to basophils and was not observed in any other cell types including mast cells. We also demonstrated that the ectopic expression of a mouse-specific tryptase mMCP11 does not lead to gp96 cleavage in human basophils. Conclusions Our study revealed a remarkable biochemical event of gp96 silencing in murine but not human basophils, highlighting the need for caution in using mouse models to infer the function of basophils in human immune response. Our study also reveals a novel mechanism of shutting down gp96 post-translationally in regulating its function."

To assess the utility of mouse central nervous system (CNS) SC-containing neurosphere cultures for studying heritable neurodegenerative disease, we compared neurosphere cultures from transgenic mice that express human tau with the P301L familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD) mutation, rTg(tauP301L)4510, with those expressing comparable levels of wild type human tau, rTg(tauwt)21221. rTg(tauP301L)4510 mice express the human tauP301L variant in their forebrains and display cellular, histological, biochemical and behavioral abnormalities similar to those in human FTD, including age-dependent differences in tau phosphorylation that distinguish them from rTg(tauwt)21221 mice. We compared FTD-hallmark tau phosphorylation in neurospheres from rTg(tauP301L)4510 mice and from rTg(tauwt)21221 mice. The tau genotype-specific phosphorylation patterns in neurospheres mimicked those seen in mice, validating use of neurosphere cultures as models for studying tau phosphorylation. Genotype-specific tau phosphorylation was observed in 35 independent cell lines from individual fetuses; tau in rTg(tauP301L)4510 cultures was hypophosphorylated in comparison with rTg(tauwt)21221 as was seen in young adult mice. In addition, there were fewer human tau-expressing cells in rTg(tauP301L)4510 than in rTg(tauwt)21221 cultures. Following differentiation, neuronal filopodia-spine density was slightly greater in rTg(tauP301L)4510 than rTg(tauwt)21221 and control cultures. Together with the recapitulation of genotype-specific phosphorylation patterns, the observation that neurosphere lines maintained their cell line-specific-differences and retained SC characteristics over several passages supports the utility of SC cultures as surrogates for analysis of cellular disease mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2036056521,"The development of biological informatics infrastructure capable of supporting growing data management and analysis environments is an increasing need within the systematics biology community. Although significant progress has been made in recent years on developing new algorithms and tools for analyzing and visualizing large phylogenetic data and trees, implementation of these resources is often carried out by bioinformatics experts, using one-off scripts. Therefore, a gap exists in providing data management support for a large set of non-technical users. The TOLKIN project (Tree of Life Knowledge and Information Network) addresses this need by supporting capabilities to manage, integrate, and provide public access to molecular, morphological, and biocollections data and research outcomes through a collaborative, web application. This data management framework allows aggregation and import of sequences, underlying documentation about their source, including vouchers, tissues, and DNA extraction. It combines features of LIMS and workflow environments by supporting management at the level of individual observations, sequences, and specimens, as well as assembly and versioning of data sets used in phylogenetic inference. As a web application, the system provides multi-user support that obviates current practices of sharing data sets as files or spreadsheets via email."
