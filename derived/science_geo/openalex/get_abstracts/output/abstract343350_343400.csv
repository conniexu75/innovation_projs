https://openalex.org/W1980144709,"Experimental observations and numerical simulations of the large force inhomogeneities present in stationary bead packs are presented. Forces much larger than the mean occurred but were exponentially rare. An exactly soluble model reproduced many aspects of the experiments and simulations. In this model, the fluctuations in the force distribution arise because of variations in the contact angles and the constraints imposed by the force balance on each bead in the pile."
https://openalex.org/W2093362732,"A class of environmentally responsive materials based on the spatial modulation of the chemical nature of gels is proposed and demonstrated here. The modulation was achieved by limiting the interpenetration of part of one gel network with another gel network. The gels so produced have an internally heterogeneous or modulated structure. Three simple applications based on the modulated gels are described here: a bigel strip, a shape memory gel, and a gel ""hand."" The bigel strip bends almost to a circle in response to a temperature increase or an increase in solvent concentration. The shape memory gel changes its shape from a straight line to a pentagon to a quadrangle as the temperature increases. These transitions from one shape to another are reversible. The gel ""hand"" in water can grasp or release an object simply by an adjustment of the temperature."

Cooperative effects at an organic-inorganic interface resulted in similar co-alignment of calcite at polymeric Langmuir-Schaefer films of 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (p-PDA). The films nucleated calcite at the (012) face, and the crystals were co-aligned with respect to the polymer's conjugated backbone. At the same time, the p-PDA alkyl side chains reorganized to optimize the stereochemical fit to the calcite structure, as visualized by changes in the optical spectrum of the polymer. These results indicate the kinds of interactions that may occur in biological systems where large arrays of crystals are co-aligned."
https://openalex.org/W1974104322,"Control strategies for urban ozone traditionally have been based on mass reductions in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Studies show, however, that some organic gas species (such as alkanes and alcohols) form an order of magnitude less ozone than equal mass emissions of others (such as alkenes and aldehydes). Chemically detailed photochemical models are used to assess uncertainty and variability in reactivity quantification. VOC control strategies based on relative reactivity appear to be robust with respect to nationwide variations in environmental conditions and uncertainties in the atmospheric chemistry. Control of selective organic gas species on the basis of reactivity can offer cost savings over traditional strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2061737554,"A strategy is presented for determining sublattice polarity at defects in compound semiconductors. Core structures of 60-degree and Lomer dislocations in the CdTe/GaAs(001) system have been obtained by the application of maximum-entropy analysis to Z-contrast images (Z is atomic number) obtained in a 300-kilovolt scanning transmission electron microscope. Sixty-degree dislocations were observed to be of the glide type, whereas in the case of Lomer dislocations, both a symmetric (Hornstra-like) core and an unexpected asymmetric structure made up of a fourfold ring were seen."

Inclulded among these comipounds are saturated and unsaturated alcohols with 8 to 15 carbon atoms, in straight-or branched-chains. Ether derivatives of several of these alcohols fuirther enhance the activity."
https://openalex.org/W2010630909,"A clone-forming thallus lacking sex organs and propagating by gemmae occurs on rocks and tree trunks in the Appalachian region from Georgia to Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky. Although bryophytic in appearance, the thallus is identified here for the first time as a greatly reduced variety of the vascular plant known as ""shoestring fern,"" Vittaria lineata (L.) J. E. Smith, or a closely related species. The normally dominant sporophytic phase of the life cycle has been eliminated and the plant exists only as a vegetative prothallus."

https://openalex.org/W2015639639,"The surface of carbonate rocks may be cleaned by etching or polishing or both, with hydrogen-ion exchange resin. This treatment reveals details in texture and fossil morphology so clearly that thin sections may be often dispensed with. Of four cleaning methods, (i) allowing resin to settle around the sample, (ii) stirring with a magnetic stirrer, (iii) agitating with an ultrasonic generator, and (iv) directing a jet stream at the sample, the first method was best for large specimens and the second method was best for well cuttings and chips."

https://openalex.org/W1990617340,"This article focuses on two areas of current research interest from the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics meeting in July 1995. The first is the possible long and unlikely seeming change of connections. Linked are the warm surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean, the atmosphere at the midlatitudes in the Southern Hemisphere and the icy stratosphere over Antarctica where the warming of the sea surface 15 years ago may have set the stage for the Antarctic ozone hole. The second major research research reviewed concerned increases in ultraviolet light. Surface radiation in the DNA-damaging region of the spectrum is increasing by as much as 12% per decade at high latitudes."

These pictures thus become a natural phonetic alphabet, with which both standard pronunciation and the nuances of dialect and accent can be represented. While a given speech sound has certain invariant characteristics, it has also an overlay of accent, which can be represented in the alphabetic character. It is suggested that the technique may be useful in teaching deaf children to speak."

By tailoring the magnetic fields with unprecedented finesse, they appear to have tamed the plasma instabilities that rattle and tear the fragile magnetic cage, allowing particles to leak out and limiting a tokamak`s performance. In the process they increased the central density of the plasma by as much as threefold and reduced the particle leakage by a factor of 50."

An experimental `wall` decontamination system will be built as a possible way of eliminating toxic chemicals. This reactive wall will be a bunker of iron filings intended to react with the toxic molecules of trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and other chemicals in the plumes."

https://openalex.org/W4255743848,"In the Research News article ""Extreme ultraviolet satellites open new view of the sky"" by Donald Goldsmith (14 Apr., p. 202), astronomer Stuart Bowyer was incorrectly identified as the director of the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Extreme Ultraviolet Astronomy. Bowyer was the founding director of the center and was succeeded by Roger Malina, who became acting director in 1994 and is now director. Malina is, with Bowyer, a principal investigator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's EUVE (Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer) mission."
