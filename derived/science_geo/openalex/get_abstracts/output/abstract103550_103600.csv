https://openalex.org/W2036838270,"In the neurological mutant mouse reeler, the histological organization of the neocortex develops abnormally and essentially results in an inversion of the relative positions of the cortical layers. The reeler mutation, therefore, provides an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the cortical layers. We have generated a monoclonal antibody (CR-50) that probes a distinct allelic antigen present in wild-type but not in reeler mutant mice. CR-50 reacted specifically with Cajal-Retzius neurons, one of the first cortical neurons to differentiate in the neocortex, but whose functional role is not known. When dissociated cerebral cortical cells were incubated with CR-50 in reaggregation culture, the genotype-dependent histogenetic assembly of wild-type cortical cells resembled that of reeler mutants. These findings revealed that the selective expression of a distinct molecule on Cajal-Retzius neurons is critical for the normal lamination of cortical neurons in the mammalian neocortex."

https://openalex.org/W1968015127,"Sympathetic neurons depend on nerve growth factor (NGF) for survival and die by apoptosis in its absence. We have investigated the pattern of expression of the Jun and Fos family of transcription factors in dying sympathetic neurons using antibodies specific for each family member. When sympathetic neurons are deprived of NGF, the level of c-Jun protein significantly increases, whereas the levels of the other members of the Jun and Fos family remain relatively constant. c-Jun also becomes more phosphorylated, probably on its amino terminal transactivation domain. When microinjected into sympathetic neurons, an expression vector for a c-Jun dominant negative mutant protects them against NGF withdrawal-induced death, indicating that AP-1 activity is essential for neuronal cell death. Furthermore, overexpression of the full-length c-Jun protein is, in itself, sufficient to induce apoptosis in sympathetic neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1963552002,"The gene defective in Huntington's disease encodes a protein, huntingtin, with unknown function. Antisera generated against three separate regions of huntingtin identified a single high molecular weight protein of approximately 320 kDa on immunoblots of human neuroblastoma extracts. The same protein species was detected in human and rat cortex synaptosomes and in sucrose density gradients of vesicle-enriched fractions, where huntingtin immunoreactivity overlapped with the distribution of vesicle membrane proteins (SV2, transferrin receptor, and synaptophysin). Immunohistochemistry in human and rat brain revealed widespread cytoplasmic labeling of huntingtin within neurons, particularly cell bodies and dendrites, rather than the more selective pattern of axon terminal labeling characteristic of many vesicle-associated proteins. At the ultrastructural level, immunoreactivity in cortical neurons was detected in the matrix of the cytoplasm and around the membranes of the vesicles. The ubiquitous cytoplasmic distribution of huntingtin in neurons and its association with vesicles suggest that huntingtin may have a role in vesicle trafficking."

https://openalex.org/W2015359970,"Human stromelysin-3, a new member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, is expressed in tissues undergoing the active remodelling associated with embryonic development, wound healing and tumour invasion. But like all other members of the matrix metalloproteinase gene family, stromelysin-3 is synthesized as an inactive precursor that must be processed to its mature form in order to express enzymic activity. Here we identify stromelysin-3 as the first matrix metalloproteinase to be discovered that can be processed directly to its enzymically active form by an obligate intracellular proteolytic event that occurs within the constitutive secretory pathway. Intracellular activation is regulated by an unusual 10-amino-acid insert sandwiched between the pro- and catalytic-domains of stromelysin-3, which is encrypted with an Arg-X-Arg-X-Lys-Arg recognition motif for the Golgi-associated proteinase, furin, a mammalian homologue of the yeast Kex2 pheromone convertase. A furin-stromelysin-3 processing axis not only differentiates the regulation of this enzyme from all previously characterized matrix metalloproteinases, but also identifies pro-protein convertases as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in matrix-destructive disease states."

https://openalex.org/W2025578163,"Huntington's Disease (HD) is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat within a putative open reading frame of a recently identified gene, IT15. We have examined the expression of the gene's protein product using antibodies developed against the N-terminus and an internal epitope. Both antisera recognize a 350 kDa protein, the predicted size, indicating that the CAG repeat is translated into polyglutamine. The HD protein product is widely expressed, most highly in neurons in the brain. There is no enrichment in the striatum, the site of greatest pathology in HD. Within neurons, the protein is diminished in nuclei and mitochondria and is present in the soluble cytoplasmic compartment, as well as loosely associated with membranes or cytoskeleton, in cell bodies, dendrites, and axons. It is concentrated in nerve terminals, including terminals within the caudate and putamen. Thus, the normal HD gene product may be involved in common intracellular functions, and possibly in regulation of nerve terminal function. The product of the expanded allele is expressed, consistent with a gain of function mechanism for HD at the protein level."

https://openalex.org/W1975715220,"Currents mediated by a glutamate transporter cloned from human motor cortex were measured in Xenopus oocytes. In the absence of glutamate, voltage jumps induced Na(+)-dependent capacitive currents that were blocked by kainate, a competitive transport antagonist. The pre-steady-state currents can be described by an ordered binding model in which a voltage-dependent Na+ binding is followed by a voltage-independent kainate binding. At -80 mV, two charges are translocated per molecule of glutamate, with a cycling time of approximately 70 ms, which is significantly slower than the predicted time course of synaptically released glutamate. The results suggest that glutamate diffusion and binding to transporters, rather than uptake, are likely to dominate the synaptic concentration decay kinetics."

https://openalex.org/W1992639694,"Members of the collapsin/semaphorin gene family have been proposed to act as growth cone guidance signals in vertebrates and invertebrates. To identify candidate molecules involved in axonal pathfinding during mouse embryogenesis, we isolated cDNAs encoding five new members of the semaphorin family (Sem A-Sem E). The murine semaphorin genes are differentially expressed in mesoderm and neuroectoderm before and during the time when axons select their pathways in the embryo. In explant cultures, recombinant Sem D/collapsin converts a matrix permissive for axonal growth into one that is inhibitory for neurites of peripheral ganglia. Our data demonstrate that semaphorins are a diverse family of molecules that may provide local signals to specify territories nonaccessible for growing axons."
https://openalex.org/W2004706690,"Inwardly rectifying K+ channels conduct more inward than outward current as a result of voltage-dependent block of the channel pore by intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines. We investigated the molecular mechanism and structural determinants of inward rectification and ion permeation in a strongly rectifying channel, IRK1. Block by Mg2+ and polyamines is found not to conform to one-to-one binding, suggesting that a channel pore can accommodate more than one blocking particle. A negatively charged amino acid in the hydrophilic C-terminal domain is found to be critical for both inward rectification and ion permeation. This residue and a negatively charged residue in the putative second transmembrane segment (M2) contribute independently to high affinity binding of Mg2+ and polyamines. Mutation of this residue also induces Mg(2+)- and polyamine-independent inward rectification and dramatically alters single-channel behavior. We propose that the hydrophilic C-terminal domain comprises part of the channel pore and that involvement of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains in pore lining may provide a molecular basis for the multi-ion, long-pore nature of inwardly rectifying K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2084864774,"Using the fluorescent membrane label FM 1-43, we have measured the release, reuptake, and repriming of synaptic vesicles in response to action potential stimulation of cultured hippocampal neurons. We find that approximately 90% of a recycling vesicle pool is released during 60 s of 10 Hz action potential firing, and that a single action potential releases approximately 0.5% of that pool. Our data also indicate that endocytic reuptake of vesicle membrane externalized by 10 Hz action potentials lags exocytosis, with a half-time on the order of 20 s, and that the minimum time for repriming of an endocytosed vesicle is on the order of 15 s. Finally, we find that once vesicles have undergone this repriming period, they become functionally mixed in the vesicle pool within a few minutes; the probability of release for recently recycled vesicles is indistinguishable from that of vesicles that have resided within the bouton for much longer periods."
https://openalex.org/W2082581761,"REK7 is an Eph-related tyrosine kinase receptor expressed exclusively in the nervous system, predominantly in hippocampus and cortex. A soluble REK7-IgG fusion protein, produced to analyze the biological role of REK7, prevents axon bundling in cocultures of cortical neurons with astrocytes, a model of late stage nervous system development and differentiation. Using REK7-IgG as an affinity reagent, we purified and cloned a novel REK7 ligand called AL-1, a GPI-linked protein homologous to other members of an emerging ligand family. Membrane attachment of AL-1 appears necessary for receptor activation, since REK7 on cortical neurons is efficiently activated by transfected cells expressing GPI-linked AL-1, but not by soluble AL-1. Consistent with this, soluble AL-1 blocks axon bundling. Our findings, together with the observation that both molecules are expressed in the brain, suggest a role in the formation of neuronal pathways, a crucial feature of nervous system development and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2021759006,"Membrane fusion resulting in neurotransmitter secretion forms the basis of neural communication. Three multimeric complexes of the protein syntaxin are important in this process: syntaxin and n-sec1; syntaxin, VAMP, and SNAP-25; and syntaxin, VAMP, SNAP-25, alpha SNAP, and NSF (20S complex). In this report, we demonstrate that unique, yet overlapping, domains of syntaxin are required to form these complexes. The formation of higher order heteromultimers has a set of structural requirements distinct from those required for dimeric interactions. Dissociation of the 20S complex by NSF following ATP hydrolysis requires amino-terminal regions of syntaxin that are outside of the binding domains for the 20S constituent proteins. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that conformational changes in syntaxin, resulting from protein-protein interactions and ATP hydrolysis by NSF, mediate neurotransmitter release."

https://openalex.org/W2093294507,"Interleukin-13 (IL-13) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) are related in structure and function and are thought to share a common receptor component. We have investigated the signal transduction pathways activated by these two growth factors, as well as insulin, in cell-lines and primary cells of lymphohemopoietic origin. All three factors induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of 170 kDa (p170), which coimmunoprecipitated with the p85 subunit of PI3’-kinase, via high affinity interactions mediated by the SH2 domains of p85. Antibodies raised against the entire insulin-receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) protein immunoprecipitated p170 much less efficiently than they did IRS-1 from 3T3 cells. However, antibodies directed against the conserved pleckstrin homology domain of IRS-1 immunoprecipitated both p170 and IRS-1 with similar efficiency, suggesting they share structural similarities in this region. In lymphohemopoietic cells, IL-13, IL-4, and insulin failed to induce increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, or its association with grb2, modification of Sos1, or activation of erk-1 and erk-2 mitogen-activated protein kinases, suggesting that p170 mediates downstream pathways distinct from those mediated by IRS-1. Both IL-13 and IL-4 induced low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk-2 and Jak-1. IL-4 also activated the Jak-3-kinase, but, despite other similarities, IL-13 did not. Insulin failed to activate any of the known members of the Janus family of kinases. In that Jak-3 is reported to associate with the IL-2γc chain, these data suggest that the IL-13 receptor does not utilize this subunit. However, both IL-13 and IL-4 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-4-140 kDa receptor chain, suggesting that this is a component of both receptors in these cells and accounts for the similarities in signaling pathways shared by IL-13 and IL-4.

https://openalex.org/W1622325070,"Recent studies on proteins residing in the Golgi complex revealed that the membrane-spanning domain of these proteins are largely responsible for their retention in the Golgi complex. We show here that β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GT) forms homodimers and large oligomers in vivo, and the formation of the homodimers is dependent on cysteine and histidine residues within the transmembrane domain. Double mutations of these residues, Cys29→ Ser and His32→ Leu, abolish homodimerization and simultaneously reduce the Golgi retention. Co-immunoprecipitation of GT and various GT chimeras with anti-GT and anti-reporter molecule antibodies revealed that large aggregates of GT are associated with α- and β-tubulins and also with other cellular proteins. This association between tubulins and GT suggests a supportive role of the cytoskeleton in the Golgi retention mechanism.

Newly synthesized proteins are either released into the cytoplasm or, if they contain a signal peptide, are translocated into the ER,1 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumGTUDP-galactose:β-D-N-acetylglucosaminide β-1,4-galactosyltransferaseTfRtransferrin receptorCHOChinese hamster ovaryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisendo Hendo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase HPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoride. entering into the sorting pathway (Walter and Lingappa, 1986Walter P. Lingappa V.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 2: 499-516Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Intracellular transport of proteins from the ER to plasma membranes is mediated by a series of carrier vesicles that bud from one compartment and then fuse with the next, giving rise to vectorial movement (Rothman and Orci, 1992Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). This transport is believed to occur by “default,” meaning that proteins which do not have either a signal for transport to a particular organelle or a specific retention signal are transported to plasma membranes (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum UDP-galactose:β-D-N-acetylglucosaminide β-1,4-galactosyltransferase transferrin receptor Chinese hamster ovary polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H polyvinylidene difluoride. The Golgi complex plays a central role in intracellular sorting and transport (Palade, 1975Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2354) Google Scholar). The Golgi complex is also the site glycosylation of nascent proteins takes place; there are over 100 different glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of protein- and lipid-bound oligosaccharides (Schachter and Roseman, 1980Schachter H. Roseman S. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Press, New York1980: 85-160Crossref Google Scholar; Beyer and Hill, 1982Beyer T.A. Hill R.L. Horowitz M. The Glycoconjugates. Vol. III. Academic Press, New York1982: 25-45Crossref Google Scholar). While newly synthesized proteins pass through the Golgi, these enzymes are retained in the Golgi complex against membrane “bulk flow.” The mechanism underlying such an apparent immobilization of glycosyltransferases in the Golgi membranes has not been well understood. Galactosyltransferase (GT; UDP-galactose:β-D-N-acetylglucosaminide β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.22) is one of the best known glycosyltransferases and catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to N-acetylglucosamine, forming the Galβ-1,4-GlcNAc linkage present in glycoproteins, glycolipids and proteoglycans (Beyer and Hill, 1982Beyer T.A. Hill R.L. Horowitz M. The Glycoconjugates. Vol. III. Academic Press, New York1982: 25-45Crossref Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of GT showed that GT is retained in the Golgi with a half-life for 21 h and is also transported to plasma membranes in HeLa cells (Strous and Berger, 1982Strous G.J. Berger E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7623-7628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Strous, 1986Strous G.J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 21: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The localization of GT in the trans-cisternae of the Golgi complex has been well documented by immunoelectron microscopy (Roth and Berger, 1982Roth J. Berger E.G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 223-229Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In some types of cells, GT is also present in plasma membranes (Lopez et al., 1985Lopez L.C. Bayna E.M. Litoff D. Shaper N.L.

Cell. 1991; 71: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although the significance of such observations in relation to the Golgi retention has not been explored. GT is a type II integral membrane protein (Masri et al., 1988Masri K.A. Appert H.E. Fukuda M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that sequences within and adjacent to the transmembrane domain of these Golgi enzymes specify Golgi retention (Munro, 1991Munro S.

Importance of membrane-spanning domains for Golgi retention has been shown in virus envelope proteins which are also retained in the Golgi (Machamer and Rose, 1987Machamer C.E. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar; Swift and Machamer, 1991Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). There is, however, no amino acid sequence similarities in the transmembrane domain among these Golgi proteins. Because of the lack of a common amino acid sequence within and/or adjacent to the transmembrane domain in these Golgi proteins, it is difficult to predict a peptide sequence for a Golgi retention signal. This is in contrast to that of ER resident proteins, which are distinguished by the presence of a carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide. Proteins bearing this signal can be retrieved from the Golgi complex back to the ER by the receptor that recognizes this signal motif (Lewis and Pelham, 1992Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, if the proteins residing in the Golgi are recycled in a similar retrieving machinery. In this report, we show data suggesting that GTs are forming homodimers in vivo, and such homodimerization is largely dependent on Cys29 and His32 residues in the transmembrane domain. Mutation of these two amino acid residues significantly affect the retention of GT in the Golgi complex. Furthermore, we show that α- and β-tubulins are associated with oligomers of GT, suggesting that such an interaction may be an important factor for Golgi retention mechanism. cDNAs encoding human CGα (Fiddes and Goodman, 1979Fiddes J.C.

Appert H.E. Johnson D. Wong S.S. Fukuda M.N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 1992). Introduction of RsrII and XhoI sites into the CGα cDNA generated a fragment of the cDNA encoding the mature CGα protein lacking a signal sequence. This fragment was ligated at the RsrII and XhoI sites in pcDNAI containing GT and to a corresponding fragment containing double-point mutated GT cDNAs, resulting in GTwild·CGα and GTSL·CGα, respectively (see Fig. 1). GTwild·TfR and GTSL·TfR were constructed in the same manner as GT·CG by introducing RsrII and XbaI sites into the extracellular domain of TfR (amino acids 97-760). Rabbit anti-human CGα antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab’)2 fragments of goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab’)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were obtained from Cappel Laboratories.

COS-1 cells were transfected with a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven pcDNAI vectors containing chimeric constructs using DEAE-dextran (Aoki et al., 1992) or DOTAP transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), according to the manufacturer's instruction. For preparation of a stably transfected cell line, CHO cells co-transfected with GTwhole·1/2CGα and pSVNeo were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Resistant clones were isolated and cloned by limiting dilution for selection of cloned cell lines. Expression of the cDNA products was examined by immunofluorescence staining of transfected cells using anti-CGα antibodies, as described (Aoki et al., 1992Aoki D. Lee N. Yamaguchi N. Dubois C. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4319-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Merged confocal images were obtained using an MRC-600 Laser-scanning Confocal Imaging system (Bio-Rad). COS-1 cells were transfected by plasmid vectors having cDNAs encoding GT, TfR, or chimeric proteins. On day 2 after transfection, cells were first incubated for 1 h in methionine-, cysteine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, then metabolically labeled for indicated times with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (100 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Radiochemicals), and were chased with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For long term labeling, cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-label in the presence of 10 μM methionine and 10 μM cysteine. After 12 h labeling, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 0.225 TIU/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM EDTA, 0.05% NaN3). Lysates were preadsorbed with protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and then reacted with protein G-Sepharose beads precoated with antibodies for 4 h at 4°C. The beads were washed four times at 4°C with the washing buffer A (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), three times at 4°C with the washing buffer B (10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and once at 4°C with the washing buffer A, and then boiled for 3 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluates from the beads were resolved in SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitates were detected by fluorography. For digestion with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H), the immunoprecipitates were eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 containing 0.15 M NaCl, 1% SDS, and 10 mM dithiothreitol, diluted with 9 volumes of 0.15 M sodium citrate, pH 5.3, containing 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then incubated at 37°C for 18 h in the presence or absence of 100 milliunits/ml endo H (Boehringer Mannheim). Following trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the proteins were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed, and analyzed by a BAS 2000 radioactive imager (Fuji Film). CHO cells stably transfected with GTwhole·1/2CG were cultured in Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells collected from 34 culture dishes (15-cm diameter) were solubilized with the lysis buffer described above. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a protein A-Sepharose CL-4B column for preclearing, and subsequently to a rabbit anti-human GT antibodies covalently immunoaffinity (Protein A Sepharose) column, which was prepared as reported (Schneider et al., 1982Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing with the washing buffers A and B, bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The eluates were immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris, pH 9, and precipitated with 6% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5%β-mercaptoethanol, heated to 50°C for 20 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electrotransfer onto a PVDF membrane (Matsudaira, 1987Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After staining with Coomassie Blue, the bands corresponding to 50 and 52 kDa were excised, and the amino-terminal sequences of the proteins were determined on an Applied Biosystems 470A gas-phase sequencer equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid analyzer. The analysis was kindly performed by Dr. Kazuo Fujikawa at the University of Washington. Continuous 5-20% (w/w) sucrose gradients were poured over a 60% (w/w) sucrose cushion, essentially as described (Zagouras et al., 1991Zagouras P. Ruusala A. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1976-1984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that all solutions were in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% NaN3. COS-1 cells expressing chimeric proteins were metabolically labeled and lysed with the lysis buffer as described above. Lysates were loaded on top of the gradients and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 19 h at 4°C. Fractions (0.8 ml) were collected from the top, immunoprecipitated, and electrophoresed followed by fluorography. In our previous studies, the expression of GT chimeras was examined 2 days after transfection by immunofluorescence microscopy, and a double point mutation, Cys29· Ser and His32· Leu, within the GT transmembrane domain has been shown to profoundly affect Golgi retention (Aoki et al., 1992Aoki D. Lee N. Yamaguchi N. Dubois C. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4319-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The expression of GTwhole/SL·1/2CG protein on cell surface was demonstrated by immuno-staining of intact COS-1 cells followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Aoki et al., 1992Aoki D. Lee N. Yamaguchi N. Dubois C. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4319-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Localization of several different chimeric proteins consisted with the portion of GT (the cytoplasmic tail, the transmembrane domain, and the stem region) and with different reporter molecules (whole CGα or the extracellular domain of TfR, see Fig. 1) were tested for their Golgi localization in transfected COS-1 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. GTwild·CG and GTwild·TfR proteins were mainly localized in the Golgi complex on 2 or 3 days after transfection (see Fig. 2B for GTwild·TfR). Double point mutation (Cys29→ Ser and His32→ Leu) of both these chimeric proteins resulted in diffuse distribution (see Fig. 2, C and D for GTSL·TfR), including cell surface (data not shown; see Aoki et al. (1992)). On the other hand TfRintact were localized on the cell surface (Fig. 2A), although there was also some staining of the cell interior, including the Golgi complex. Pulse-labeling and chase experiments (Fig. 3) showed that at chase time 0 all of the GTwild·TfR (lane 1) and GTSL·TfR (lane 5) are converted to 75-kDa protein (lanes 2 and 6) by endo H digestion. After 2 h chase, about 40% of GTwild·TfR was converted to 75 kDa band (lane 4, lower band), suggesting that this portion of GTSL·TfR was remained in the ER while the rest of the GTSL·TfR (lane 4, upper band) was transported to the Golgi. After 2 h of chase, about 20% of GTSL·TfR mutant was converted to the band of 75 kDa (shown by an arrow in lane 8) by endo H, suggesting that this portion of GTSL·TfR was remained in the ER while most of GTSL·TfR (lane 8, upper band) was transported to the Golgi. Thus Cys29 and His32 residues in the transmembrane domain of GT appear to affect both intracellular transport and Golgi retention. COS-1 cells were transfected with vector alone, plasmid vectors encoding TfRintact, GTintact·TfR, or GTSL·TfR (Fig. 1). On day 2 after transfection, COS-1 cells were labeled with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys for 1 h, followed by a 2-h chase period, and were immunoprecipitated using anti-TfR antibodies. When the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, all mature proteins of TfRintact, GTwild·TfR, and GTSL·TfR were detected as approximately 90-kDa bands under reducing conditions (Fig. 4). The formation of dimers (approximately 180 kDa, shown by an arrowhead in lane 3) was observed in the cells transfected with GTwild·TfR (lane 3) but not with GTSL·TfR (lane 2). These results suggest that GTwild·TfR polypeptides are forming homodimers in these cells, which appear to be relatively resistant to SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. These results also show that the dimer formation is largely dependent on the presence of Cys29 and His32 residues in the transmembrane domain of GT. Because Cys and His residues are often involved in metal chelating as exemplified in zinc finger proteins (Beng, 1990Beng J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6513-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of EDTA and o-phenanthroline on the dimers were examined. Thus the immunoprecipitates of GTwild·TfR were boiled with 50 mM EDTA or 10 mMo-phenanthroline in the presence of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol just prior to SDS-PAGE. EDTA and o-phenanthroline, however, did not dissociate the dimers to monomers (data not shown). These observations suggest that metal chelating is not involved in the dimer formation between GT molecules. Dimer formation of GT is probably due to the secondary structure induced by a unique conformation of peptide within the lipid bilayer (Bormann et al., 1989Bormann B.-J. Knowles W.J. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4033-4037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Machamer, 1993Machamer C.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In parallel to the above described experiments, we examined whether any proteins are associated with GT. We performed extensive co-immunoprecipitation analysis using GTintact and three GT chimeric proteins, GTwhole·1/2CG, GTwild·CG, and GTwild·TfR (see Fig. 1 for chimeras). COS-1 cells were transfected with plasmid vectors containing these cDNAs. On day 2 after transfection, COS-1 cells were labeled with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys, and cell lysate was subjected for immunoprecipitation. When the immunoprecipitates using anti-TfR antibodies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5, lanes 1-3), monomer and dimer of GTwild·TfR were detected as 90-kDa (lane 3, asterisk) and 180-kDa (lane 3, arrowhead) bands, respectively. TfRintact, which can pass through the Golgi complex without apparent Golgi retention, was used as a control. COS-1 cells transfected with GTintact were also included as a control to detect any nonspecific component co-immunoprecipitated with anti-TfR antibodies. In these analyses, we repeatedly found that two proteins at approximately 50 and 52 kDa (Fig. 5, arrows) were co-immunoprecipitated with the portion of GT molecule that contains the cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, and stem region. The 50- and 52-kDa proteins were not detected or were only faintly detectable in the immunoprecipitates of TfRintact (lane 2) and that of control (lane 1). COS-1 cells transfected with GTwhole·1/2CG, GTintact, and TfRintact were subjected for immunoprecipitation using polyclonal anti-GT antibodies (Fig. 5, lanes 4-6). GTwhole·1/2CG proteins were detected at approximately 66, 63, and 57 kDa (monomers; asterisks in lane 4) and at 132, 126, and 114 kDa (dimers; arrowheadsin lane 4). The difference in these molecular sizes are most likely caused by diffferences in glycosylation. GTintact was detected at 52 kDa (monomer; asterisk in lane 5) and 104 kDa (dimer; arrowhead in lane 5). The 50- and 52-kDa proteins were detected again in the immunoprecipitate of GTwhole·1/2CG (lane 4). Although these two co-immunoprecipitated proteins are not clearly visible in the immunoprecipitates of GTintact (Fig. 5, lane 5), this is because 50- and 52-kDa proteins overlap with GTintact proteins on SDS-PAGE. The 50- and 52-kDa proteins were not detected or only faintly detectable in the control (lane 6). These results (Fig. 5) indicate that, regardless of the antibodies or reporter molecules used, co-precipitation of 50- and 52-kDa proteins depends on the portion of GT molecule consisted with cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, and stem region. To identify the 50- and 52-kDa proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with GT, these proteins were purified and their amino acid sequences were determined. The 50-kDa and 52-kDa proteins were co-purified with GT from the lysate of CHO cells stably expressing GTwhole·1/2CG by affinity chromatography using an anti-GT antibody column (see details under “Materials and Methods”). The immunopurified materials were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane, and subsequently subjected for amino-terminal sequence analysis. Fig. 6 shows the Coomassie Blue staining of the gel and the amino-terminal sequences determined. The 52- and 50-kDa proteins were found identical to α- and β-tubulin, respectively. In addition, amino acid sequence confirmed the 57-kDa protein as GT. Since there were reports describing that the oligomerization is an important factor for Golgi retention of the resident proteins (Nilsson et al., 1994Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar; Swift and Machamer, 1991Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we examined the relationship between oligomerization of GT and association of tubulins. COS-1 cells were transfected with GTwild·TfR, labeled with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys, and subsequently solubilized. Lysates were loaded onto 5-20% sucrose density gradients, centrifuged, and fractionated into 13 fractions. The sucrose gradient centrifugation was calibrated using molecular size markers, thus the fractions which should contain GT monomer and dimer were determined to be fractions 2/3 and 4/5, respectively. 35S-Labeled proteins in each fraction were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-TfR antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 7, monomers of GTwild·TfR (approximately 90 kDa) were detected in fraction 2 and later fractions. Dimers of GTwild·TfR (approximately 180 kDa) were detected in fraction 4 and later fractions. The GT polypeptides fractionated in tubes later than fraction 5 are considered as oligomers larger than trimers. Therefore the result shown in Fig. 7 indicates that a substantial quantity of GTwild·TfR polypeptides in the cell lysate behaved as if they are large oligomers. The result (Fig. 6) also shows that α- and β-tubulins appear only in fraction 7 and later fractions, suggesting that α- and β-tubulins associate only with large oligomers of GT but not with a monomer. Recent studies indicate that the transmembrane domain and adjacent cytoplasmic and luminal domains of Golgi resident proteins are largely responsible for these proteins to be retained in the Golgi complex (Machamer and Rose, 1987Machamer C.E.

However, it is not yet clear how these transmembrane and adjacent domains lead to Golgi retention. In this paper, we investigate the molecular mechanism of Golgi retention by using GT as a model system. We found that the double point mutation (Cys29→ Ser and His32→ Leu) within the transmembrane domain of GT, reduced Golgi retention of the molecule significantly (Fig. 2; see also Aoki et al. (1992)). As shown in Fig. 4, the presence of these two amino acid residues is critical for dimer formation. The formation of homodimers may facilitate further oligomerization of GT (Fig. 7), which could result in apparent immobilization of GT in the Golgi membrane. Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that GT oligomers associate with α- and β-tubulins (Fig. 7). Microtubules, composed of filamentous polymeric assemblies of a heterodimer of one α- and one β-tubulin polypeptides, are cytoskeletal components of cells and play a central role in rapid organelle movements, which occur in such processes as vesicle fusion and transport in some vesicle fusion events, and in some steps of transport (Allen et al., 1982Allen R.D. Metuzals J. Tasaki I. Brady S.T. Gilbert S.P. Science. 1982; 218: 1127-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.-P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In addition, microtubules are involved in maintaining the Golgi structure since disruption of the microtubule network during mitosis or drug-induced disassembly leads to fragmentation and scattering of Golgi complex throughout the cell (Turner and Tartakoff, 1989Turner J.R. Tartakoff A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2081-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar; Kreis, 1990Kreis T. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1990; 15: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar; Iida and Shibata, 1991Iida H. Shibata Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Reassembly of the microtubule network results in reaggregation of the Golgi complex at the microtubule-organizing center (Ho et al., 1989Ho W.C. Allan V.J. van Meer G. Berger E.G. Kreis T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 48: 250-263PubMed Google Scholar). Microtubules are the only cytoskeletal elements for which structural and some functional relationships to the Golgi complex have been established. Accordingly, it is possible that α- and β-tubulins actively participate in the organization of the Golgi complex, thus playing a role in retention of resident proteins in the Golgi complex. Presently, we do not know how GTs interact with α- and β-tubulins. We envisage that GTs form homodimers (Fig. 4, 5, and 7), which subsequently further aggregate to form a large complex in the Golgi membrane (Fig. 7). Such a complex may associate with proteins present in the cytoplasm, in the membrane, and in the lumen of the Golgi. As shown in this study, the dimer formation and subsequent oligomerization may be mediated primarily by the transmembrane domain. The GT oligomers may then anchor either directly or indirectly to the bundle of tubulins. As tubulins are a part of microtubule-based motor proteins, Golgi retention and transport of GT could be supported and guided by a microtubule-based network as has been suggested previously (Strous et al., 1991Strous G.J. Berger E.G. van Kerkhof P. Bosshart H. Berger B. Geuze H.J. Biol. Cell. 1991; 71: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because tubulins localize in the cytoplasm, the association of GT with tubulins may be mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of GT. Deletion of the cytoplasmic tail caused leakage of GT to the plasma membranes (Nilsson et al., 1991Nilsson T. Lucocq J.M. Mackay D. Warren G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3567-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar; Aoki et al., 1992Aoki D. Lee N. Yamaguchi N. Dubois C. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4319-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that Golgi retention of GT is stabilized by its association with cytoplasmic component. However, association of tubulin may not be the cause of Golgi retention but rather the result of it, because GT and tubulin are co-localized in HeLa cells, which were treated with brefeldin A (Strous et al., 1991). Furthermore, our preliminary data showed that GTSL mutant proteins were also associated with α- and β-tubulins, although careful analysis should be carried out to define differences, if any are present, between GTSL proteins at the Golgi and at cell surface. It is possible that other proteins are involved in the association between GT and tubulins. In fact, we have detected five additional proteins co-immunoprecipitated with GT and GT chimeras but not with TfR. 2N. Yamaguchi and M. N. Fukuda, unpublished data. 2 It is not presently clear whether or not other Golgi enzymes also associate with tubulins. Slusarewicz et al.(1994) identified a functional medial Golgi “matrix,” which could promote binding of medial Golgi enzymes. The matrix includes several proteins, although they appear not to include α- and β- tubulins, and GT did not bind to the matrix. It is therefore possible that the association of tubulins is unique to GT or trans-Golgi enzymes. Currently, two models have been proposed for the mechanism of Golgi retention, which are not mutually exclusive. (i) Golgi enzymes form large hetero- and/or homo-oligomers via their lumenal and transmembrane domains by “kin recognition.” The oligomers attach to the matrix via the cytoplasmic domains, leading to prevent Golgi enzymes from entering into the budding transportation vesicles (Weisz et al., 1993Weisz O.A.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). (ii) Retention depends on the length of transmembrane domains and the lipid composition of the membranes in the Golgi complex; increasing the length of the transmembrane domain could direct Golgi enzymes to the plasma membrane (Munro, 1991Munro S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3577-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar; Masibay et al., 1993Masibay A.S. Balaji P.V. Boeggeman E.E. Qasba P.K. J. Biol.

The results obtained by present study are consistent with the first model, in which oligomerization of proteins is an important factor for being retained in the Golgi complex. The present study also suggests that GT oligomers are stabilized in the Golgi by their direct or indirect association with tubulins and that the Golgi retention is a part of the intracellular process controlled by the cytoskeleton.

No GluR7, KA-1, or KA-2 subunit mRNAs were detected. Analysis of the editing sites of the GluR6 mRNA demonstrated that the three editing sites present in these subunits are edited to a different extent. Predominant expression of the unedited variant (Q) was observed, but edited and unedited variants may coexist in the same cell. In addition, we show that the Q/R site from the GluR6 subunit controls functional properties of native kainate receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2011445039,"Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is the most abundant protein associated with phospholipids in pulmonary surfactant. There are several lines of evidence that pulmonary and gastrointestinal epithelium produce closely related surface-active materials, although the presence of SP-A in gastrointestinal tract has so far not been reported. Indirect immunofluorescence experiments using different antibodies raised against rat pulmonary SP-A showed that some jejunal and colonic but not gastric epithelial cells positively stained for SP-A. Analysis of the proteins in cell lysates from rat small intestine and colon studied by Western blot revealed several immunoreactive bands, including the characteristic triplet of 26-, 32-, and 38-kDa monomeric proteins, less strongly labeled than in lung cells, and higher molecular mass forms of 66 and 120 kDa also present in lung cells. The 66- and 120-kDa bands displayed the expected isoelectric pH of SP-A after two-dimensional electrophoresis. Alkylation induced conversion of the 120-kDa form (almost completely) and the 66-kDa form (partly) into the 26-38-kDa monomeric species. The presence of SP-A mRNA in rat stomach, small intestine, and colon was then searched for by conventional cDNA/reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Products of appropriate size (372 base pairs) identical to that of pulmonary tissue were amplified in small intestine and colon but not in stomach or in other tissues used as controls. Cloning and sequencing of rat colon SP-A cDNA revealed the same sequence as the one reported for rat lung SP-A. Furthermore, analysis of the transcriptional initiation site of SP-A gene in colon by anchored-polymerase chain reaction showed that transcription was initiated at the same site in both colon and lung. These data, which demonstrate that small intestine and colon express SP-A constitutively and that this protein is present in some epithelial cells, extend the concept of intestinal surfactant and underline its close relationships to pulmonary surfactant.

The 66- and 120-kDa bands displayed the expected isoelectric pH of SP-A after two-dimensional electrophoresis. Alkylation induced conversion of the 120-kDa form (almost completely) and the 66-kDa form (partly) into the 26-38-kDa monomeric species. The presence of SP-A mRNA in rat stomach, small intestine, and colon was then searched for by conventional cDNA/reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Products of appropriate size (372 base pairs) identical to that of pulmonary tissue were amplified in small intestine and colon but not in stomach or in other tissues used as controls. Cloning and sequencing of rat colon SP-A cDNA revealed the same sequence as the one reported for rat lung SP-A. Furthermore, analysis of the transcriptional initiation site of SP-A gene in colon by anchored-polymerase chain reaction showed that transcription was initiated at the same site in both colon and lung. These data, which demonstrate that small intestine and colon express SP-A constitutively and that this protein is present in some epithelial cells, extend the concept of intestinal surfactant and underline its close relationships to pulmonary surfactant."

Extracellular application of charged, membrane-impermeant methanethiosulfonates irreversibly modified currents at four cysteine-substituted positions, K382, Y380, I379, and D378. Intracellular exposure to methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium revealed another set of reactive mutants (V374, T373, T372, and T370). Our results indicate that positions 378 and 374 are exposed at outer and inner mouths of the channel, respectively, and immersed in the aqueous phase. In contrast to present topological models, the 383-369 region appears to span the pore mainly as a nonperiodic structure."
https://openalex.org/W1974331467,"Asymmetric cell divisions allow a sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell to generate a neuron and its support cells in the Drosophila PNS. We demonstrate a role of tramtrack (ttk), previously identified as a zinc finger-containing putative transcription factor, in the determination of different daughter cell fates. Both loss of function and overexpression of ttk affect the fates of the SOP progeny. Whereas loss of ttk function transforms support cells to neurons, ttk overexpression results in the reverse transformation. ttk is expressed in support cells but not in neurons. It has been shown that numb, a membrane-associated protein asymmetrically distributed during the SOP division, confers different daughter cell fates. Loss of ttk or numb function results in reciprocal cell fate transformation. Epistatic studies suggest that ttk acts downstream of numb. We propose that ttk executes the command dictated by asymmetrically localized numb to specify distinct daughter cell fates during multiple asymmetric divisions."
https://openalex.org/W2031869859,"To elucidate guidance mechanisms of brain commissural axons, we examined the navigation of cerebellofugal axons. Axons were labeled by implantation of the fluorescent tracer Dil into the cerebellar plate (CP) of fixed, flat whole-mount embryonic rat brain. Axons initially grew straight toward the ventral midline floor plate (FP) in the rostral hindbrain and then, after crossing it, made a right-angled turn to grow either caudally or rostrally along the longitudinal axis. In collagen gel culture, CP axons showed directed growth toward both FP explants and heterologous cells expressing netrin-1, a FP-derived chemoattractant for spinal commissural axons. These results suggest that CP axons are guided to the midline by FP-derived chemoattractant(s) and then reoriented, possibly by another guidance cue, for longitudinal extension. Considering that the basic structures of the neural tube, including the FP, extend up to the caudal diencephalon, these results suggest that common guidance mechanisms operate for ventrally decussating commissural axons in both the brain and spinal cord."

https://openalex.org/W1991591173,"In the bilaterally symmetrical vertebrate CNS, all developing axons must choose between remaining on the same side of the midline or growing across it. The mechanism underlying this axonal pathfinding is, however, poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the ventral midline floor plate (FP) chemorepels two types of ipsilaterally projecting axons, one from the alar plate and another from the basal plate in the mesencephalon. We further demonstrate that the FP chemoattracts contralaterally projecting myelencephalic as well as metencephalic axons. The FP at all axial levels displayed both chemoattractive and chemorepellent activities, suggesting that FP chemoattraction and chemorepulsion may be at work throughout the neuraxis. Chemotropic guidance by the FP may therefore play a key role in the establishment of neuronal projection laterality."
https://openalex.org/W2041504987,"Ecotin, a serine protease inhibitor found in the periplasm of Escherichia coli, is unique in its ability and mechanism of inhibiting serine proteases of a broad range of substrate specificity. However, although the catalytic domain of human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) has 40% identity to bovine trypsin and the substrate specificities of these two proteases are virtually identical, ecotin inhibits uPA almost 10,000-fold less efficiently than trypsin. Ecotin was expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage (ecotin phage) to allow the isolation of more potent inhibitors of uPA from a library of ecotin variants.

Biochem. 1990; 23: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). uPA has been found to be involved in the activation of pericellular proteolysis during cell migration and tissue remodeling, while the function of tPA is primarily connected to intravascular clot dissolution (3Dano K.

Although no three-dimensional structure currently exists for human uPA, it is thought to be composed of three domains: an NH2-terminal domain (residues 1-45), which has partial homology to EGF (5Gunzler W.A.

Frankus E. Flohe L. Hoppe-Seyler's Z Physiol. Chem. 1982; 363: 1043-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The EGF-like domain of uPA binds the membrane-bound urokinase receptor (8Vassalli J.D. Baccino D. Belin D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), localizing the proteolytic activity of uPA to the cell surface. Receptor-bound uPA has been shown to cleave a 66-kDa extracellular matrix protein (9Keski-Oja J. Vaheri A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 720: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as well as fibronectin (10Quigley J.P. Gold L.I. Schwimmer R. Sullivan L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2776-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The presence of uPA on the cell surface also allows the formation of cell-surface plasmin, which is capable of degrading most components of the extracellular matrix, either directly or through activation of procollagenases (3Dano K.

High levels of receptor-bound uPA are found on the surface of many cancer cells (12Kirchheimer J.C. Wojta J. Christ G. Binder B.R.

The role of uPA and its receptor in tumor invasion and metastasis suggests two possible approaches for chemotherapeutic intervention: one by blocking specific interactions between the EGF-like domain of uPA and the uPA receptor, and the other by specific inhibition of the proteolytic activity of uPA. A truncated, soluble form of the uPA receptor was produced genetically and shown to reduce the amount of uPA that bound to cells expressing wild-type uPA receptor (15Masucci M.T. Pedersen N. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8655-8658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By acting as a scavenger for uPA, the soluble uPA receptor also inhibited the proliferation and invasion of human cancer cells (16Wilhelm O. Weidle U. Hohl S. Rettenberger P. Schmitt M. Graeff H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a uPA mutant which lacked proteolytic activity while retaining full receptor binding affinity was shown to compete for cell surface receptors and, in turn, inhibit metastasis (17Crowley C.W. Cohen R.L. Lucas B.K. Liu G. Shuman M.A. Levinson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Finally, high-affinity urokinase receptor antagonists were identified from a pentadecamer random peptide library and were shown to compete with the EGF-like domain of uPA for binding to the uPA receptor (18Goodson R.J. Doyle M.V. Kaufman S.E. Rosenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although a certain extent of success in anti-invasion and anti-metastasis has been achieved in vitro using this approach, rapid clearance of uPA, uPA receptor derivatives, or natural peptides may pose a problem if they are used as therapeutic agents. Less effort has been made toward developing specific inhibitors for uPA, presumably because of the difficulty of discriminating uPA from other serine proteases. Of the synthetic uPA inhibitors that have been described to date, the 4-substituted benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamidines were the most potent and were shown to inhibit cell surface uPA as well as cell surface uPA-mediated fibronectin degradation (19Towle M.J. Lee A. Maduakor E.C. Schwartz C.E. Bridges A.J. Littlefield B.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2553-2559PubMed Google Scholar). The natural macromolecular inhibitor of the plasminogen activators is the type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), a single-chain glycoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa (20van Mourik J.A. Lawrence D.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14914-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, PAI-1 does not discriminate between the plasminogen activators, inactivating tPA and uPA with nearly identical secondary rate constants (21York J.D. Li P. Gardell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8495-8500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, high PAI-1 levels have recently been found to associate with malignancy in a number of cancers (22Grondahl-Hansen J. Christensen I.J. Rosenquist C. Brunner N. Mouridsen H.T. Dano K. Blichert-Toft M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2513-2521PubMed Google Scholar, 23Janicke F. Schmitt M. Pache L. Ulm K. Harbeck N. Hofler H. Graeff H. Breast Cancer Res.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 120-123PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that, in addition to functioning as a uPA inhibitor in normal cells, PAI-1 or its complex may play a role in promoting growth or spreading of cancers. These attributes disfavor the use of PAI-1 as a therapeutic agent. Ecotin is a dimeric serine protease inhibitor found in the periplasm of Escherichia coli, where each unit of the dimer contains 142 amino acids (26Chung C.H. Ives H.E. Almeda S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11032-11038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27McGrath M.E. Hines W.M. Sakanari J.A. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6620-6625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ecotin has been found to inhibit pancreatic serine proteases of a broad range of specificity but not any known proteases from E. coli(26Chung C.H. Ives H.E. Almeda S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11032-11038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, ecotin has also been found to be a highly potent anticoagulant and a reversible tight-binding inhibitor of human factor Xa (28Seymour J.L. Lindquist R.N. Dennis M.S. Moffat B. Yansura D. Reilly D. Wessinger M.E. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3949-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ecotin belongs to the “substrate-like” class of inhibitors (29Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar) with Met-84 at the reactive-site (the P1 site) (27McGrath M.E. Hines W.M. Sakanari J.A. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6620-6625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A crystal structure of ecotin complexed with trypsin showed that two trypsin molecules bind to an ecotin dimer in a 2-fold symmetry (30McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to the interactions through a primary site that includes the reactive-site loop, ecotin makes a total of 9 hydrogen bonds to trypsin through a secondary binding site located at the distal end of ecotin relative to the reactive site. Modeling studies with ecotin and other proteases including chymotrypsin and elastase indicates that similar interactions could occur, along with other unique contacts. The chelation of a target protease through the two binding sites is a unique feature of ecotin since most serine protease inhibitors interact with their target proteases predominately through their reactive-site loop (31Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The bidentate binding scheme utilized by ecotin may allow fine tuning of protease inhibition toward specific targets through protein engineering efforts. Although the catalytic domain of uPA and trypsin are homologous (7Steffens G.J. Gunzler W.A. Otting F. Frankus E. Flohe L. Hoppe-Seyler's Z Physiol. Chem. 1982; 363: 1043-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and their substrate specificities are virtually identical, ecotin is a poor inhibitor of uPA proteolytic activity. We attempted to convert ecotin into a potent uPA inhibitor using phage display to aid our understanding of protease-inhibitor recognition and uPA function. It was previously shown that a bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor variant with altered specificity and high affinity toward human neutrophil elastase could be isolated from a library of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor variants by phage display technology (32Roberts B.L. Markland W. Ley A.C. Kent R.B. White D.W. Guterman S.K. Ladner R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This demonstrated the feasibility of studying protease-inhibitor interactions using this technique. Phage display allows the expression of a diverse library of peptides or protein variants on the surface of filamentous M13 bacteriophage (33Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar, 34Parmley S.F. Smith G.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). This in turn allows the isolation of individual phage particles that display desired binding properties by an in vitro selection process. Since the phenotype of each phage is directly linked to its genotype, specific mutations in the displayed peptide or protein that confer a desired function can be readily identified. Using this technology, a number of antigen-antibody interactions have been studied (34Parmley S.F. Smith G.P.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have shown that the phage display approach can be broadly generalized to other protease inhibitors by displaying ecotin on the surface of phagemid-derived bacteriophage (ecotin phage). Ecotin was chosen because of its unusual ability to inhibit trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase (26Chung C.H. Ives H.E. Almeda S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11032-11038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its unique mechanism of inhibition (30McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Its broad specificity suggests a structural flexibility which would allow modifications via protein engineering to confer novel properties. The crystal structure of ecotin complexed with a variant of rat trypsin was solved recently (30McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Combined with information from the three-dimensional structure, phage display can be used to search designed libraries of ecotin mutants that affect interactions at the inhibitor/protease interface. Variants with high affinity toward a particular target protease can then be readily isolated and characterized. Herein, we report the display of ecotin on the surface of phagemid-derived bacteriophage, and the isolation of mutants with high affinity toward uPA. Enzymes and reagents for molecular cloning were purchased from New England Biolabs and were used following the manufacturer's instructions. The E. coli strain JM101 and the VCSM13 helper phage were from Stratagene. Low molecular weight uPA (LMuPA) was obtained from American Diagnostica. Bovine trypsin was from Sigma. The chromogenic substrate Z-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide used for trypsin kinetics analysis was from Bachem, and the chromogenic substrate Z-γ-Glu(α-t-butoxy)-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Spectrozyme UK) used for LMuPA kinetics analysis was from American Diagnostica. 4-Methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate was from Sigma. α-35S-dATP was from DuPont NEN. Sequenase Version 2.0 sequencing kit was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Oligonucleotides were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer. The phagemid pBSeco-gIII was constructed to produce ecotin on the surface of the surface of filamentous phage. These phage are referred to as ecotin phage. The ecotin expression plasmid pTacTacEcotin (41McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Browner M.F. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was digested with the restriction endonucleases BamHI and HindIII. The resulting DNA fragment encoding the ecotin gene and its signal sequence was ligated to the large fragment of BamHI/HindIII-digested pBluescript to produce pBSecotin. The DNA sequence coding for amino acids 198-406 of gene III of M13 was generated from M13 mp18 DNA using polymerase chain reaction; the forward primer was 5’-GTC ACG AAG CTT CCA TTC GTT TGT GAA TAT CAA GG-3’, and the reverse primer was 5’-GCA CGA AGC TTA AGA CTC CTT ATT ACG CAG TAT G-3’. After HindIII digestion, the polymerase chain reaction product was inserted into a HindIII site at the 3’ end of the ecotin gene of pBSecotin. The stop codon at the COOH terminus of the ecotin gene was then removed, and a Gly-Gly-Gly tether was introduced at the junction of the fusion gene. This was achieved by site-directed mutagenesis (42Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar) using the primer 5’-CG GTA GTT CGC GGC GGC GGA GCT GAA AGC GTC CAG-3’. The resulting plasmid construct was named pBSeco-gIII. A pBSeco-gIII mutant in which codons 84 and 85 and the third base pair of codon 83 of the ecotin gene were deleted was constructed to provide control phage that did not express the ecotin gene. This mutant, pBSeco-gIIIΔ, was made by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer 5’-C AGT TCC CCG GTT AGT AC GCC TGC CCG GAT GG-3’. A pBSeco-gIII library with random mutations at codons 84 and 85 of the “reactive-site” loop of ecotin was created by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide 5’-C AGT TCC CCG GTT AGT ACT NNS NNS GCC TGC CCG GAT GG-3’ (N = A/C/G/T; S = G/C) as the primer and the uracilated, single-stranded pBSeco-gIII as the template. Also introduced by this primer was a ScaI site, which enabled facile differentiation between native templates and mutant templates. The library of ecotin phage had 1024 possible DNA sequences that resulted in 400 possible protein sequences. For the preparation of pBluescript, pBSeco-gIII, and pBSeco-gIIIΔ bacteriophage, plasmid DNAs were transformed into a male strain (F’) of JM101. A single colony selected on ampicillin plates was grown in 3 ml of 2YT medium (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl/liter) containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin at 37°C for 7 h. The culture was diluted into 30-100 ml of 2YT/ampicillin, grown to A600 = 0.25, and infected with the helper phage VCSM13 at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 100 helper phage per cell. The infected culture was allowed to grow at 37°C with shaking for approximately 12 h. Phage particles were harvested by precipitation with 5% polyethylene glycol and resuspended in 1 ml of TBS buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Phage titers typically ranged from 5 ×1010 to 2× 1011 cfu/ml culture. For library phage preparation, the mutagenesis reaction mixture was ethanol-precipitated, redissolved in water, electroporated into F’ JM101, and plated on 150-mm LB/ampicillin plates. Cells from the plates were recovered in 5 ml of LB/ampicillin and diluted in 50 ml of 2YT/ampicillin to an A600 = 0.25, and then infected with VCSM13 helper phage. The infected culture was grown for 12 h at 37°C with shaking, and the phage were harvested as described above. Approximately 5 × 1010 cfu were loaded in duplicate onto a single 1% agarose gel with 25 mM Tris, 250 mM glycine (pH 8.6) as the running buffer (43Corey D.R. Shiau A.K. Yang Q. Janowski B.A. Craik C.S. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The gel was electrophoresed at 6 mA constant current for 16 h. One set of samples was transblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was immunostained for ecotin by allowing it to react with rabbit anti-ecotin antibodies followed by reaction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. The other set of samples were denatured by soaking the gel in 0.5 N NaOH for 4 h, washed by soaking in water for 4-8 h, and stained with ethidium bromide. pBSeco-gIII and pBSeco-gIIIΔ phage were suspended in trypsin assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0) and adjusted to 1.5 × 101313 cfu/ml. Various volumes of phage solution were incubated with 0.5 nM trypsin in a total volume of 125 μl of trypsin assay buffer, 0.01% Tween 80 in a 96-well microtiter plate at room temperature for 20 min. After adding 125 μl of 0.1 mM substrate Z-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide, the residual trypsin activity was measured by monitoring the increase of optical density at 405 nm. Polystyrene Petri dishes (35 mm, Falcon) were coated with 1 ml of 10 μg/ml bovine trypsin or LMuPA in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.5) overnight, and excess binding sites were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk solution for 2 h. For control experiments, Petri dishes were coated with 5% non-fat dry milk solution. Phage were added to the dishes in buffer containing 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated overnight with gentle agitation at room temperature. Solutions containing the phagemid were then removed and the dishes were washed 9 times with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20. Each wash was approximately 1 min. Bound phage were serially eluted by incubation with 1 ml of 0.1 N HCl/glycine solution (pH 2.2) with gentle shaking for 15 min at room temperature. Three elutions were performed. The eluates were neutralized with 185 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). For biopanning against immobilized trypsin, a mixture of pBSeco-gIII phage (1.1 × 108 cfu) and pBluescript phage (2.8 × 108cfu) was used. An aliquot of the appropriately diluted solution of each wash and elution was used to infect 100 μl of saturated JM101 cells. After incubation for 15 min at 37°C, the infected cells were plated on LB/ampicillin plates containing IPTG and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside. The cfu ratio of pBSeco-gIII phage to pBluescript phage was calculated by the number of white and blue colonies, respectively. For biopanning against immobilized LMuPA, a mixture of 2.5 × 1010 cfu library phage were used. Phage from the third elution were amplified for the next cycle of panning. Ecotin and ecotin mutants were produced in bacteria from the expression vector pTacTacEcotin (41McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Browner M.F. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The expression and purification procedures were as follows. JM101 cells were freshly transformed with expression plasmid DNA. A single colony selected from ampicillin plates was used to inoculate 3 ml of LB containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were grown at 37°C for 9 h and diluted to 1 liter of LB/ampicillin. Following growth at 37°C for 1 h, IPTG was added to the cultures to a final concentration of 0.2 mM, and continued to grow for 12 h at for 37°C. Cells were harvested and treated with lysozyme in a solution containing 25% sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The periplasmic fraction was dialyzed against 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 2.8). Following the dialysis, the supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and to 0.3 M NaCl. The solution was heated in boiling water for 10 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was dialyzed against water overnight at 4°C. The solution containing the ecotin was loaded onto a Vydac C4 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography column (2.2 × 25 cm) which was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was washed and then eluted with a linear gradient of 34-37% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 10 ml/min over 30 min. Fractions were analyzed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), and the ones containing pure ecotin were pooled and lyophilized. Purified ecotin was redissolved in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and stored at 4°C. The concentrations of ecotin and ecotin mutants were determined using a calculated molar extinction coefficient (45Gill S.C. von Hippel H.P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar) of 2.2 × 104 cm-1M-1 and were in good agreement with that from the Bradford assay (data not shown) (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). LMuPA was titrated with 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate to obtain an accurate concentration of enzyme active sites. Various concentrations of ecotin or ecotin mutants were incubated with human LMuPA in a total volume of 990 μl of buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.7), 0.01% Tween 80. The final concentrations of LMuPA used for the determination of equilibrium dissociation constants, Ki, of ecotin or ecotin mutants were as follows: 0.5 nM (M84R/M85R); 1.0 nM (M84R, M84K, and M84R/M85K); 7.2 nM (wild-type). The final concentrations of ecotin mutants ranged from 0.6 to 40 nM, and the concentrations of wild-type ecotin ranged from 1.25 to 50 μM. Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature to reach equilibrium, 10 μl of 10 mM substrate Z-γ-Glu (α-t-butoxy)-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide was added and the rate of p-nitroaniline formation was measured by monitoring the change of absorption at 410 nm in a 10-min period. The data were fit to the equation derived for kinetics of reversible tight-binding inhibitors (47Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 48Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods.

The presence of the 3’-UTRs by themselves had no substantive effect on β-gal expression. However, the 3’-UTR from a mspS plus its IR resulted in about 20-fold more β-gal activity and RNA in stationary phase relative to logarithmic phase cells. In contrast, the 3’-UTRs plus IRs of mspL and mspC had either no or little effect, respectively, on β-gal expression.

During growth in liquid culture, promastigotes of many Leishmania species develop from a less infectious form in the logarithmic phase of growth to a highly virulent form in stationary phase (7Ramamoorthy R.

In Leishmania chagasi, this increase in virulence is accompanied by an 11-fold increase in the amount of gp63 per cell (10Zarley J.H. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Clin.

The haploid genome of L. chagasi contains 18 or more genes encoding gp63, named msp for genes of the major surface protease (11Roberts S.C. Swihart K.G. Agey M.W. Ramamoorthy R. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These genes (1.8 kb coding region) are clustered in tandem on a single chromosome (Fig. 1) and are differentially expressed by promastigotes during growth in vitro(7Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. Paetz K.E. Maybodi M. Roberts S.C. Wilson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1888-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Roberts S.C. Swihart K.G. Agey M.W. Ramamoorthy R. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At least five genes in the cluster (mspS1-S5 in Fig. 1) encode a 3.0-kb mRNA species that occurs predominantly in stationary phase promastigotes. A minimum of 12 mspLs encode a 2.7-kb gp63 mRNA expressed predominantly in logarithmic phase promastigotes, and one mspC specifies two gp63 mRNA species of 2.6 and 3.1 kb that are expressed constitutively throughout promastigote growth in vitro. The major differences among the three classes of gp63 genes and their mRNAs are the unique sequences and lengths of their 3’-untranslated regions (3’-UTRs) and downstream intergenic regions (IRs) (7Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. Paetz K.E. Maybodi M. Roberts S.C. Wilson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1888-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A few clustered point differences also occur in the coding regions of mspS1-S5 (11Roberts S.C. Swihart K.G. Agey M.W. Ramamoorthy R. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to changes in these same clustered regions, mspC encodes a gp63 with an altered and longer carboxyl terminus in which the signal for attachment of a glycolipid anchor is replaced by a sequence of 41 amino acids that could be a transmembrane region with a short cytoplasmic tail. Previously, we showed that inhibitors of protein synthesis affect the steady state levels of the three gp63 mRNA classes differently (12Wilson M.E. Paetz K.E. Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15731-15736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of the 2.7-kb mspL mRNA increases 16-fold after incubation in cycloheximide or other protein synthesis inhibitors, even though the transcriptional rate of the mspLs is unaltered. This increase in the steady state level of the 2.7-kb mspL mRNA is accompanied by a corresponding increase in its half-life, suggesting that its abundance is controlled by a labile regulatory protein that specifically targets this mRNA for degradation. In contrast, the amounts of the 3.0-kb mspS mRNA and the two mspC mRNAs increase only 2-fold or less in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. Thus, their steady state levels are regulated by a different molecular mechanism than is that of the mspL mRNA. In Leishmania and other trypanosomatid protozoa, tandem copies of the same gene, or adjacent genes specifying different proteins, are often transcribed into a polycistronic precursor RNA (13Muhich M.L.

These precursor transcripts are processed into individual mRNAs by intergenic cleavages followed by addition of a 39-nucleotide spliced leader (SL) to the 5’ ends in a trans-splicing reaction and addition of a poly(A) to the 3’ ends via polyadenylation (19LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rushe L. Beverley S.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 20Walder J.A. Eder P.S. Engman D.M. Brentano S.T. Walder R.Y. Knutzon D.S. Dorfman D.M.

Biol. 1993; 13: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mRNA abundance could be regulated at one or both of these addition reactions. For example, the efficiency of trans-splicing has been shown to be affected by the pyrimidine richness of the sequence near the splice acceptor site which varies for different genes (22Huang J. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3877-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Layden R.E. Eisen H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, it has yet to be demonstrated that these intergenic pre-mRNA processing sites participate in the mechanisms of differential expression. Here we show that all three classes of the tandemly arrayed gp63 genes are constitutively transcribed throughout promastigote growth in vitro. The three different 3’-UTRs and their IRs were cloned immediately downstream of the β-galactosidase (β-gal) coding region to examine the influence of these sequences on β-gal expression during promastigote growth from logarithmic to stationary phase. We find that the IR downstream of mspS affects the levels of β-gal RNA and enzymatic activity, but that the corresponding IRs downstream of mspL and mspC have no effect and much less effect, respectively. Thus, the downstream IR regulates mspS, but not mspL, mRNA abundance in different promastigote growth phases. In contrast, protein synthesis inhibitors have the opposite effect; they affect mspL, but not mspS, mRNA abundance (12Wilson M.E. Paetz K.E. Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15731-15736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results collectively demonstrate that expression of both mspLs and mspSs is regulated post-transcriptionally but that this regulation occurs via different molecular mechanisms for the two gene classes. A Brazilian isolate of L. chagasi was kindly provided by Richard Pearson at the University of Virginia. Parasites were maintained in hamsters, and promastigotes were cultured in vitro in a modified minimal essential medium (HOMEM) as described previously (24Pearson R.D. Steigbigel R.T. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2195-2201PubMed Google Scholar), with or without 20 μg of G418/ml (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.). All plasmids were derived from the parent plasmid pX-βgal kindly provided by Steve Beverley (25LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 3’-UTR of a mspS and its downstream IR, and the 3’-UTR of a mspL and its downstream IR, were isolated by XbaI/SalI double digestion of recombinant phage DNAs containing these genomic DNA regions of L. chagasi (11). XbaI cleaves at the stop codon of mspS and mspL, and SalI cleaves 5 base pairs downstream from the start codons of all known L. chagasi gp63 genes (see Fig. 1). Since a XbaI site does not occur in mspC, its 3’-UTR and downstream IR were obtained by PCR amplification using a forward primer whose sequence includes the mspC stop codon and a reverse primer whose sequence is near the SalI site of the downstream mspS4 (Fig. 1). The 3’-UTRs alone of mspL and mspS were excised from the corresponding cDNAs using XbaI which cleaves at the stop codon and at a downstream site in the vector. The 3’-UTR of mspC was obtained by PCR amplification. These fragments were cloned into an XbaI site at the end of the β-gal coding region in pX-βgal, as depicted in Fig. 1. Plasmid DNAs used for transfections were prepared using Qiagen columns (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) according to the supplier's instructions. The plasmids were transiently transfected into early logarithmic or stationary phase L. chagasi by electroporation as described previously (26Coburn C.M. Otteman K.M. McNeely T. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Stable, G418-resistant, L. chagasi transfectants were obtained by plating parasites 1 day after transfection on agar plates containing medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented as described (27Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Plates were incubated at 26°C under CO2, and colonies were picked 2 weeks later and grown in 1 ml of HOMEM. Parasites were transferred to 5 ml or more of HOMEM and grown under the selective pressure of 20 μg of G418/ml. Extracts of logarithmic (7-8× 106 cells/ml) or stationary (4-7× 107 cells/ml) phase cells were prepared and assayed for β-gal enzyme activity as described (25LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Promastigotes were harvested in logarithmic or stationary phase and centrifuged at 3000 rpm in a Beckman J-6B centrifuge for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended at 4× 107 cells/ml in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (0.5 M hexylene glycol, 1 mM Pipes, 1 mM spermidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100 were added to a final concentration of 0.5% each, and the cells were lysed by vigorously vortexing for 30 s. Immediately, 2 volumes of ice-cold 2× nuclei wash buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.64 M sucrose, 1 mM spermidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 60 mM KCl) were added and mixed by vortexing. As described previously (12Wilson M.E. Paetz K.E. Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15731-15736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the nuclei were concentrated and incubated with [α-32P]UTP, and the labeled RNA was isolated for use in probing filters. The filters contained 2 μg each of single-stranded M13mp19 DNA without insert or with insert containing the coding regions of ATPase and gp63, or the 3’-UTRs of mspL, mspS, and mspC, or a 430-bp sequence from the large subunit rRNA of L. chagasi. RNA and DNA were isolated from logarithmic or stationary phase promastigotes, and Northern or Southern blots were conducted as described (11Roberts S.C. Swihart K.G. Agey M.W. Ramamoorthy R. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For Southern blots, DNA probes were 32P-labeled with a random primer labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). For Northern blots, 32P-labeled noncoding strand DNA probes were prepared from PCR products by a primer extension reaction using an oligonucleotide specific for the noncoding strand. Long exposures of Northern blots containing L. chagasi promastigote RNA probed with the gp63 coding region (not shown) revealed the expected gp63 mRNAs plus a faint ladder of larger multimeric sized RNA molecules, suggesting that some, and perhaps all, of the tandem gp63 genes are transcribed into a polycistronic precursor RNA. To examine which gp63 gene classes are transcribed during logarithmic and stationary phases of growth, nuclear run-on experiments were conducted. Nuclei were isolated from promastigotes in each growth phase, and their nascent RNAs were labeled by incubation with [α-32P]UTP for use as probes in slot blot hybridizations of the plus and minus strands of various genes or 3’-UTRs (Fig. 2). The drug α-amanitin (500 μg/ml) was included in some nuclei incubations as a control to verify the authenticity of the nuclear run-on assays. This drug inhibits transcription of most protein-coding genes in trypanosomatids, with the notable exception of genes for the surface proteins of African trypanosomes (procyclin and the variant surface glycoprotein) (28Kooter J.M. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9457-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29Rudenko G. Le Blanco S. Smith J. Gwo Shu Lee M. Rattray A. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, transcription of the 3’-UTRs of mspL, mspS, and mspC occurred to the same extent in both logarithmic and stationary phase nuclei, despite the fact that mspL transcripts occur predominantly in logarithmic phase cells and mspS transcripts appear predominantly in stationary phase cells (6Wilson M.E. Hardin K.K. Donelson J.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 678-684PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. Paetz K.E. Maybodi M. Roberts S.C. Wilson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1888-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the differential expression of mspL and mspS mRNAs at the different growth stages must be controlled by regulatory events that occur post-transcriptionally. The housekeeping genes for an ATPase and a ribosomal RNA served as control genes in this analysis, and their transcription occurred equally in both logarithmic and stationary phase cells, as expected. Transcription of all the genes tested was derived predominantly from the expected plus strand. In addition, transcription of the genes for gp63 and ATPase was clearly inhibited by α-amanitin, a feature of genes normally transcribed by RNA polymerase II, whereas transcription of the ribosomal RNA gene was not inhibited as expected for genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I. Thus, unlike African trypanosomes, genes for the major protein on the surface of Leishmania promastigotes are transcribed by a conventional RNA polymerase II. Since the differential expression of the three gp63 gene classes is controlled post-transcriptionally and since all of the genes share the same 5’-UTR (11Roberts S.C. Swihart K.G. Agey M.W. Ramamoorthy R. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the unique 3’-UTRs of these genes and/or their associated downstream intergenic regions (IRs) may play a role in this post-transcriptional regulation. To examine this possibility, the 3’-UTRs alone and the 3’-UTRs plus their associated IRs were cloned downstream of the β-gal coding region in the plasmid pX-βgal (25LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, this plasmid contains a gene for neomycin resistance which permits selection of transformed Leishmania cells in the presence of the drug G418 and also contains the Escherichia coli gene for β-gal whose activity can be assayed readily. Both genes are transcribed when the plasmid is transfected into promastigotes, and both have an upstream SL addition signal (25LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the first series of experiments, the 3’-UTRs alone of mspL, mspS, and mspC (extending from the stop codon through the 3’-poly(A)) were isolated by restriction enzyme digestion or by PCR amplification of the corresponding cloned cDNAs. The lengths of these 3’-UTRs are 1.2, 0.9, and 1.3 kb, respectively, for mspS, mspL, and mspC (7). They were cloned in both orientations at a XbaI site immediately downstream of the β-gal coding region. A total of six recombinant plasmids (containing each of the three 3’-UTRs inserted in both orientations) and the parent plasmid pX-βgal were electroporated into promastigotes. In some experiments the circular plasmids were transiently transfected into either logarithmic or stationary phase promastigotes, and, after 24 h of incubation in culture medium (without G418), a protein extract was prepared for assaying β-gal activity. In other experiments, stably transfected cells were cloned by plating and then grown in liquid medium containing G418 for 3 weeks before an extract was prepared for β-gal enzyme assays. It turned out that in all cases the presence and orientation of the three different 3’-UTRs alone had little or no effect on the relative amount of β-gal enzyme activity in either logarithmic or stationary phase cells (not shown). In no case was the activity altered more than 1.5-fold from that of the parent plasmid pX-βgal. This lack of a substantive difference in the β-gal activity derived from 3’-UTR-containing plasmids and from the parent plasmid was observed in both cells transiently transfected with the plasmids for 1 day and cells stably transfected with the plasmids for several weeks. In the next set of experiments, the 3’-UTRs plus their associated downstream IRs were cloned behind the β-gal coding region, as indicated in Fig. 1. These cloned segments extend from the gp63 termination codon to a SalI site 5 base pairs beyond the start codon of the downstream gp63 gene. Their lengths are 4.2, 1.2, and 1.7 kb, respectively, for mspS, mspL and mspC. Again, these segments were inserted in both orientations relative to the β-gal gene, and the recombinant plasmids were introduced transiently or stably into promastigotes. When the segments were in the reverse orientation, only small differences (less than 2-fold) from that of pX-βgal occurred (not shown). When the segments were inserted in the forward direction, however, the results summarized in Table I were obtained.Table Iβ-Galactosidase activity assays Open table in a new tab Table I shows the results of four independent sets of assays utilizing promastigotes stably transfected with pX-βgal or pX-βgal containing the downstream 3’-UTRs + IRs of mspL, mspS, and mspC. These promastigotes were grown to logarithmic phase (day 2 or 3) or stationary phase (day 8 or 9), and cell extracts were prepared for β-gal enzyme assays. The growth phases were defined according to concentration and morphology as described previously (10Zarley J.H. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the pX-βgal transfectants, the amount of β-gal activity was about 11-fold more during logarithmic phase than stationary phase (15.7 units versus 1.4 units), which likely reflects the increased metabolic rate at that growth stage. Thus, the amounts of β-gal activity in the logarithmic or stationary phase transfectants containing pX-βgal were normalized to one, and the relative amounts of activity in the other transfectants adjusted to this normalized value. For example, the normalized β-gal activity value in logarithmic phase promastigotes containing the mspS 3’-UTR + IR is 0.3. The ratios of the normalized values in stationary cells versus logarithmic cells are given in the right-hand column of Table I. This ratio was 0.8 when the mspL 3’-UTR + IR was downstream of the β-gal gene, indicating that this region does not affect substantively the relative amounts of β-gal activity in logarithmic and stationary phase promastigotes. It was 2.7 when the corresponding region of mspC was present, suggesting that this region causes a 2-3-fold increase in the level of β-gal in stationary phase cells. The most dramatic change, however, was with mspS 3’-UTR + IR, where a 19.7-fold increase in the β-gal activity occurred in stationary versus logarithmic phase cells. Of this nearly 20-fold difference, about 3-fold is due to a decrease of β-gal activity in logarithmic phase cells when mspS 3’-UTR + IR is present versus when pX-βgal is present (0.3 unit versus 1.0 unit), and the remainder is due to an increase in stationary phase cells relative to when pX-βgal is present (5.9 units versus 1.0 unit). To see if the differences in β-gal activity shown in Table I reflect differences in β-gal mRNA levels, Northern blots were conducted on total RNAs extracted from the same stably transfected logarithmic or stationary phase promastigotes. Fig. 3 shows the results of a Northern blot probed with the β-gal coding region and with the unique 3’-UTR of mspC. As expected, no β-gal RNA occurred in untransfected promastigotes (lanes 1, left panel). In both logarithmic and stationary phase cells containing pX-βgal (lanes 2, left panel), the β-gal probe hybridized predominantly to a 7.5-kb RNA and weakly to smaller RNAs. Since the 5’-UTR of the β-gal RNA is very short due to the presence of a SL addition site just upstream of the 3-kb β-gal coding region (25LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), about 4.5 kb of the major 7.5-kb β-gal RNA must be a 3’-UTR derived from the plasmid sequence. The simplest explanation of this result is that transcription extended about 4.5 kb beyond the β-gal gene to a sequence fortuitously recognized by Leishmania as a site for polyadenylation (or as a site for SL addition which in turn directs the location of polyadenylation, see Ref. 19LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rushe L. Beverley S.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). When the 3’-UTR + IR of mspL was present (lanes 3), a β-gal RNA of 4.4 kb occurred in both logarithmic and stationary phase cells that was only slightly more abundant than the 7.5-kb β-gal RNA from pX-βgal (compare lanes 2 and 3). Two conclusions can be derived from this result. First, neither the 0.9-kb 3’-UTR nor the 0.3-kb IR of mspL enhances the abundance of the β-gal RNA in logarithmic phase cells or diminishes it in stationary phase cells. Thus, this 1.2-kb sequence by itself is not sufficient to regulate the different levels of mspL RNA in logarithmic and stationary phase cells. Secondly, the 0.3-kb IR provides a signal for polyadenylation (or adjacent downstream SL addition (19LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rushe L. Beverley S.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar)) because insertion of this segment reduces the size of the β-gal RNA from 7.5 kb to about 4.4 kb. If one considers the length of the poly(A) tail and the distance between the SL and the β-gal start codon, it is likely that this signal is the same one used for polyadenylation and/or SL addition by the mspLs flanking this IR. In cells containing the 3’-UTR + IR of mspS (lanes 4), a β-gal RNA of 4.6 kb was much more abundant in stationary phase than in logarithmic phase cells (compare the two lanes 4 in the left panel). This result is consistent with the finding that stationary phase cells containing this recombinant plasmid had about 20 times more β-gal activity than did the corresponding logarithmic phase cells (Table I). In addition, the 4.6-kb size of the RNA (versus 4.4 kb when the 3’-UTR + IR of mspL was present) suggests that the mspS polyadenylation site is used. When the 3’-UTR + IR of mspC was present (lanes 5), little or no difference in the abundance of the β-gal RNAs in logarithmic and stationary phase cells was observed despite the 2.7-fold increase in β-gal activity in stationary cells (Table I), but consistent with the fact that the mspC RNAs vary in abundance either minimally or not at all during promastigote growth (7Ramamoorthy R.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15731-15736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of at least two β-gal RNA species in these cells (particularly apparent in lane 5 containing RNA from stationary phase cells) is consistent with the occurrence of two mspC mRNAs (2.6 and 3.1 kb), as generated by two independent polyadenylation (or SL addition) signals downstream of mspC (7). Since the relative abundance of the mspC protein product in logarithmic versus stationary phase promastigotes is not known, we did not examine further the discrepancy between the 2.7-fold increase in β-gal activity in stationary phase cells and the lack of a corresponding increase in β-gal RNA levels. However, one possibility for this discrepancy is that there is a difference in the translational efficiency of the mspC mRNAs in the two growth phases. The nitrocellulose filter was stripped and reprobed with the unique 3’-UTR of mspC (Fig. 3, right panel) to verify the presence of the 2.6-kb and 3.1-kb mspC mRNAs in all of the transfected cells and to confirm the existence of the chimeric β-gal RNAs containing the 3’-UTR of mspC (lanes 5). As expected, all lanes had weak bands correspon"

T.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 2023-2031). Moreover, the binding of the fused particles to the heparin proteoglycan component of the granules was found to be strengthened. We have now treated LDL particles with α-chymotrypsin and examined the strength with which the proteolytically modified LDL binds to human aortic proteoglycans on an affinity column. We found that chymotryptic degradation of the LDL particles triggered particle fusion. The higher the degree of proteolytic degradation, the higher were the degree of fusion and the strength of binding to the aortic proteoglycans. Separation of the proteolyzed particles by size exclusion chromatography into two fractions, unfused and fused particles, and analysis of their binding strengths revealed that not only the fused but also the unfused proteolyzed particles bound more tightly to the proteoglycans than did the native LDL particles. To investigate the mechanism underlying this increase in binding strength, we attached [13C]dimethyl groups to the lysines and used NMR spectroscopy to quantify the active lysine residues of apoB-100, which are thought to be located in basic areas of apoB-100 and involved in binding of LDL to proteoglycans. Analysis of the 13C-labeled particles showed that, despite loss of apoB-100 fragments from the particles, the number of active lysine residues in the unfused proteolyzed particles had not decreased. In the fused proteolyzed particles, the number of active lysine residues was markedly increased. Thus, proteolytic fusion appears to increase the number of basic domains of apoB-100, which would explain the observed increase in the strength of binding of the modified LDL particles to arterial proteoglycans.

(1991) <i>J. Cell Biol.</i> 115, 607-618). The mutant protein, PS-NGFR, also shows a dramatic increase in its ability to endocytose NGF and to recycle through basolateral endosomes. We report here the site-directed mutagenesis analysis of PS-NGFR to localize and characterize its basolateral and endocytic sorting signals. Both signals reside in the proximal part of the PS cytoplasmic tail, between positions 306 and 314. Transferring the cytoplasmic tail (19 residues) and transmembrane domain of a truncated PS mutant to the ectodomain of the placental alkaline phosphatase, an apical glypiated ectoenzyme, redirected it to the basolateral membrane and the endocytic compartments. A tyrosine at position 308, present in this short cytoplasmic segment, was mutated into phenylalanine or alanine. The resulting mutants were expressed predominantly on the apical membrane of MDCK cells. Their ability to endocytose NGF was reduced with the alanine mutant showing the stronger diminution. The PS mutant contains a short cytoplasmic sequence necessary both for basolateral targeting and endocytosis, and the requirement for tyrosine at position 308 is crucial for basolateral targeting."

It is apparent that resistance to TG develops in parallel with (a) selection of cells expressing high levels of SERCA ATPases, and (b) selection of an ATPase that is resistant to TG. INTRODUCTIONThe Sarco-Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ (SERCA)1 1The abbreviations are: SERCAsarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+TGthapsigarginCHLChinese hamster lungMTXmethotrexateMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. ATPases are key enzymes in the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ through the establishment and maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Specific inhibitors of the SERCA pumps have been identified, of which the sesquiterpene lactone thapsigargin (TG) is the most potent and specific (1Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R.

Exposure of cell cultures to TG results in several effects, including alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and inhibition of cell proliferation (6Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Adv. Second Mess. Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 265-308PubMed Google Scholar, 7Short A.D. Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, resistance to TG inhibition of cell proliferation can be developed (8Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is associated with TG-resistant ATP-dependent calcium transport into intracellular stores, as shown in situ(9Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Hussain A. Gill D.L. FASEB J. 1994; 8: A1416Google Scholar). To facilitate characterization of the TG-resistant enzyme, we have used a cell line transfected and selected for stable expression of exogenous SERCA1 ATPase (DC-3F/Ca cells), in addition to a parent line (DC-3F cells) sustaining only expression of endogenous ATPase. We describe here the functional properties of the SERCA ATPases affected by the development of resistance to TG, both in situ and following isolation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell LinesDC-3F is a cell line that was originally established from Chinese hamster lung (CHL) fibroblasts (10Biedler J.L. Riehm H. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 1174-1184PubMed Google Scholar). As described previously, DC-3F/Ca was derived from DC-3F by transfection of the dual promoter expression vector pHβFCaA3 containing a mutant methotrexate (MTX)-resistant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cDNA (under the control of a SV4O promoter) and an avian SERCA1-encoding cDNA (under the control of a β-actin promoter), followed by selection in MTX (11Hussain A. Lewis D. Sumbilla C. Lai L.C. Melera P.W. Inesi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). TG-resistant cell lines (DC-3F/TG and DC-3F/CaTG) were developed via stepwise selection of DC-3F or DC-3F/Ca cells in gradually increasing concentrations of TG (LC Laboratories) over the course of several months, with the final maintenance concentration being 2 μM TG for each line (8Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these cell lines were maintained in α-minimum essential medium media (Sigma) supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus appropriate concentrations of drug where indicated. Thus, the cells were maintained in the following: DC-3F/Ca in 25 μg/ml MTX, DC-3F/TG in 2 μM TG, DC-3F/CaTG in 25 μg/ml MTX plus 2 μM TG. Parental DC-3F cells were cultured in the absence of any drug. In some of the experiments with DC-3F/CaTG cells where TG was removed from the culture media for various lengths of time, the cells were still kept on 25 μg/ml MTX.Cell Growth AssaysCells were plated at 10,000-15,000 cells/plate in 35-mm plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. TG was added the next day, and the cells were incubated for an additional 72 h at 37°C, then trypsinized and counted.Microsome PreparationThe procedure was described by Sumbilla et al.(12Sumbilla C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21185-21192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Immunodetection StudiesImmunofluorescent detection of transfected SERCA1 in the cells was carried out as described by Karin et al.(13Karin N.J. Kaprielian Z. Fambrough D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Determination of SERCA protein in microsomes was obtained via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (7.5% polyacrylamide), run as per the method of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205964) Google Scholar) and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper. The filters were blocked with 3% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline solution for 1 h at room temperature, and then probed with either the SERCA1 CaF3-5C3 antibody or a mouse SERCA2 antibody that recognizes both isoforms of SERCA2 (IID8 F6) (15Jorgensen A.O. Arnold W. Pepper D.R. Kahl S.D. Mandel F. Campbell K.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1988; 9: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Bound antibody was detected with a secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) and a commercially available ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). Densitometry was carried out using an LKB Ultroscan XL enhanced laser densitometer.High Resolution Ca2+ ImagingThe procedures for subcellular imaging of Ca2+ stores in permeabilized cells were as described by Short et al.(16Short A.D. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25887-25893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated that under appropriate permeabilization conditions, fura-2 remains trapped within intracellular organelles where it reports the local [Ca2+]. Ca2+ uptake into organelles was initiated by adding ICM plus 3 mM ATP and 1 or 10 μM free Ca2+. TG was added to the appropriate solution as indicated, from a 1000-fold concentrated stock solution dissolved in Me2SO. Changes produced by Ca2+ binding to fura-2 within the organelles were determined by fluorescence microscopy, using dual excitation fluorescence at 380 and 358 nm, nearest neighbor deblurring of images at 2-μm focal planes for each wavelength and conversion to the pseudo-color images using image processing procedures described by Short et al.(16Short A.D. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25887-25893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Ca2+ Transport StudiesCa2+ transport was assayed by incubating 5 μg/ml DC-3F/Ca or DC-3F/CaTG microsomes, or 10 μg/ml DC-3F/TG microsomes, in a reaction mixture containing 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM CaCl2 supplemented with 45Ca2+ (specific activity of 3000 dpm/nmol), 5 mM K+ oxalate, and 0.2 mM EGTA at 37°C. For the Ca2+ affinity experiments, free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated from total Ca2+ and EGTA according to Fabiato and Fabiato (17Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1978; 276: 233-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mM ATP. At sequential times (up to 60-90 min), 1-ml samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter and quenched with 20 ml of chilled lanthanum chloride/MOPS, pH 7.0, solution. Ca2+ uptake was determined by quantitating the radioactivity on the filters via liquid scintillation counting and was expressed per mg of microsomal protein.RESULTSCharacterization of the TG-resistant Cell LinesFig. 1 demonstrates that the DC-3F/TG and the DC-3F/CaTG cell lines, developed by exposure to increasing concentrations of TG, are highly resistant to inhibition by TG. That is, DC-3F/TG and the DC-3F/CaTG cells are nearly 3 orders of magnitude more resistant to TG than parental DC-3F and DC-3F/Ca cells.It can be also shown by immunofluorescence staining that resistance to TG develops in parallel with selection of cells expressing high levels of SERCA ATPase. In fact, it is shown in Fig. 2(compare A and C) that in the DC-3F/Ca population used in these studies, more than 50% of the cells have lost expression of the transfected SERCA1 when compared to the original DC-3F/Ca cell line previously described (11Hussain A. Lewis D. Sumbilla C. Lai L.C. Melera P.W. Inesi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is clear that 100% of the cells express SERCA1 ATPase following selection of DC-3F/Ca in TG (compare B and D). Furthermore, the overall expression of SERCA1 within each cell in the TG-resistant population appears to be increased, as judged by fluorescence intensity. Western blotting of microsomal fractions reveals that SERCA expression is greatly increased following the acquisition of resistance to TG, with expression of the exogenous SERCA1 being 20-fold higher and that of the endogenous SERCA2 being 2-fold higher in DC-3F/CaTG when compared to DC-3F/Ca cells (Fig. 3, Table I).Figure 2:Immunofluorescent visualization of SERCA1 in DC-3F/Ca (panels A and C) and DC-3F/CaTG (i.e. TG-resistant) cells (B and D).

In these studies, the ratio of fura-2 fluorescence at excitation wavelengths of 380 and 358 nm provided a relative estimate of the Ca2+ concentration within the organelles, represented by pseudo-color images of the perme-abilized cells in Fig. 4. Fig. 4B (compared to Fig. 4A) shows that in permeabilized DC-3F/Ca cells, exposure to ICM plus 1 μM free Ca2+ and 3 mM ATP resulted in uptake of Ca2+ into the organelles. Ca2+ uptake was dependent on the presence of both Ca2+ and ATP (not shown) and was completely blocked by 2 μM TG (Fig. 4, C and D). No additional uptake was observed in the presence of ICM containing ATP plus 10 μM Ca2+ (not shown).Figure 4:Pseudo-color Ca2+ images of permeabilized DC-3F cells. Within each pair of images, left panel shows the organellar Ca2+ image just before, and right panel after exposure of the cells to ICM containing 1 μM Ca2+ and 3 mM ATP.

Note that DC-3F/Ca cells take up Ca2+ to levels about 2-fold higher than DC-3F/CaTG cells; the parental line takes up relatively little Ca2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4 (E and F) shows that the organelles of DC-3F/CaTG cells are able to sustain ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake, which is not inhibited by 4 μM TG (Fig. 4, G and H). Ca2+ uptake within the DC-3F/CaTG cells, however, was lower than in DC-3F/Ca cells by about one-half, even though the immunofluorescence results in Fig. 2 suggest that DC-3F/CaTG cells have significantly higher SERCA1 expression than the DC-3F/Ca cells. The reduced Ca2+ uptake in the DC-3F/CaTG cells may in part be a consequence of partial inhibition of the SERCA ATPases by the TG originally present in the culture medium. It should be pointed out that Ca2+ uptake within the DC-3F/CaTG cells is still much higher than that obtained with the parental line DC-3F (Fig. 4, compare H with J).Owing to uncertainties in the estimation of the affinity of fura-2 for Ca2+ within the organelles, we have expressed the calibration of fluorescence ratio as [Ca2+] normalized to the Kdof the indicator. In spite of this approximation, the images shown in Fig. 4, which are examples derived from observations made in the course of 11 independent experiments, give a clear indication of the occurrence of TG sensitive and TG-resistant Ca2+ uptake by ER stores in situ. A more quantitative evaluation was obtained by measuring directly the ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by microsomal vesicles isolated from the cells (see below).It is noteworthy that the uptake studies in permeabilized cells were carried out in the presence of FCCP, which inhibits uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria. Therefore, the contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ in our imaging studies was negligible.Ca2+ Transport in Isolated MicrosomesThese studies were best performed with microsomes isolated from DC-3F/Ca cells due to the relatively high expression of SERCA1 and, hence, the relatively high rates of Ca2+ transport in such cells. The activities of microsomes prepared from DC-3F/Ca and DC-3F/CaTG (TG-resistant) cells are shown in Fig. 5A. The average initial rates of Ca2+ transport are 21.2 ± 2.3 nmol of Ca2+ uptake/mg of protein/min for DC-3F/Ca microsomes and 14.2 ± 2.6 nmol of Ca2+ uptake/mg of protein/min for the DC-3F/CaTG microsomes (Table I). Therefore, the microsomal membranes of the TG-resistant cells retain approximately half of their overall capacity for Ca2+ transport as compared with controls (i.e. DC-3F/Ca cells), which have not been exposed to TG. Since the SERCA1 content is approximately 20-fold greater and SERCA2 content is 2-fold greater in the microsomes derived from the TG-resistant cells (Fig. 3 and), the percentage of functional SERCA ATPase in the DC-3F/CaTG cells is apparently less than 5%, due to the inhibition produced by the TG present in the culture media until cell harvest. Nevertheless, this residual activity is much higher than that recovered from (nontransfected) DC-3F or DC-3F/TG cells (Fig. 5A).Figure 5:Ca2+ transport activity of microsomes. A, microsomal vesicles were obtained from DC-3F/Ca (■), DC-3F/CaTG (●), DC-3F (◊), and DC-3F/TG cells (▼). The DC-3F/CaTG and DC-3F/TG cells were maintained on TG until the day of microsomal harvest, but the reaction medium for Ca2+ uptake contained no TG. B, Ca2+ uptake rates were determined in the presence of various concentrations of TG added to the reaction medium for Ca2+ uptake. Rates of Ca2+ transport (expressed as fractional values of the maximal rate obtained in the absence of TG) are plotted as a function of TG concentration for microsomes obtained from DC-3F/Ca (■), DC-3F/CaTG (●), and DC-3F/TG cells (▼).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When Ca2+ uptake by isolated microsomes is measured as a function of the concentration of TG added to the reaction mixture for Ca2+ uptake, 50% inhibition of the maximal rates of uptake requires 100 nM TG for the microsomes obtained from DC-3F/CaTG cells, as compared to 0.1 nM TG for the microsomes obtained from DC-3F/Ca cells (Fig. 5B). Most importantly, the low (Fig. 5A) activity recovered from (nontransfected) DC-3F/TG cells requires TG concentrations in the micromolar range for inhibition (Fig. 5B). In fact, this low level of highly resistant ATPase may be present even in the DC-3F/CaTG microsomes as a small percentage of the total ATPase, whose inhibition spans a wide range of TG concentrations. Note that in Fig. 5B the activities are normalized; in fact, in DC-3F/TG it is only a small fraction of the DC-3F/CaTG activity (Fig. 5A).Removal of TG from Culture Media following Acquisition of Resistance by DC-3F/CaTG CellsSince stepwise selection in TG results in the overexpression of TG-resistant SERCA pumps in the DC-3F/CaTG cell line, we explored the consequences of removing TG selection on the functional properties of SERCA in these resistant lines. Thus, in some experiments, TG was removed from the culture media and the microsomes subsequently harvested for analysis after 2, 6, or 12 days following the TG removal.Western blot analysis reveals that SERCA1 expression gradually decreases upon removal of TG, so that 12 days after TG removal the overall expression of SERCA1 is reduced to one-third of that seen when cells are continuously maintained on TG (Fig. 6, Table I). Expression of the endogenous SERCA2 also decreases in DC-3F/CaTG as these cells are kept off TG (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Analysis of DC-3F/CaTG cells taken off TG. Western blotting of microsomal fractions obtained from DC-3F/CaTG at various times following removal of TG from the culture medium. SERCA1: lane 1, DC-3F (5 μg); lane 2, DC-3F/Ca (10 μg); lane 3, microsomes from DC-3F/CaTG cells maintained on TG until day of harvest (2 μg); lane 4, microsomes from DC-3F/CaTG harvested 2 days following removal of TG from culture medium (2 μg); lane 5, 6 days following TG removal (2 μg); lane 6, 12 days following TG removal (2 μg).

This overall increase in activity tapered off in several days following withdrawal of TG (Table I). Considering the overall expression of SERCA protein, and assuming no changes in ATPase turnover, our experiments indicate that the percentage of functional enzyme was reduced to 5% as a consequence of continuous exposure to TG, and then increased gradually by the 12th day following removal of TG. Furthermore, SERCA-dependent Ca2+ transport became progressively more sensitive to TG inhibition as microsomes were harvested following withdrawal of TG from the cell culture media (Table I, Fig. 7). It is noteworthy that even though a minimal change in overall SERCA1 and SERCA2 expression occurred within the first 2 days following withdrawal of TG (Fig. 6), the ED50 value for TG inhibition of Ca2+ transport by isolated microsomes decreased by more than 16-fold (Fig. 7, Table I). This suggests that a small fraction of the SERCA pump is TG-insensitive and operative primarily in the TG-resistant cells, while operation of a TG-sensitive enzyme becomes more prominent following withdrawal of TG.Figure 7:Rates of Ca2+ transport (expressed as fractional values of maximal rate of transport obtained in the absence of TG) are plotted as a function of TG concentration. ●, microsomes from DC-3F/CaTG cells maintained on TG until day of harvest; □, microsomes from DC-3F/CaTG harvested 2 days following removal of TG from the culture medium; +, 6 days; ▲, 12 days; ■, DC-3F/Ca, i.e. no exposure to TG in the culture medium.

Fig. 8 compares the rates of Ca2+ transport as a function of Ca2+ concentration for microsomes obtained from DC-3F/CaTG and from the same cell line harvested 12 days after withdrawal of TG. These experiments show hardly any difference in the Ca2+ concentration range required for activation of microsomes obtained from cells exposed to TG until harvest or cells harvested 12 days following removal of TG. Therefore, it is apparent that TG resistance does not impair the ability of the SERCA pumps to function within the Ca2+ concentration range required for homeostasis.Figure 8:Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ transport by various microsomes. Microsomes obtained from DC-3F/CaTG maintained on TG until day of harvest (□) or harvested 12 days following removal of TG from the culture medium (▲).

Sagara Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 141: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). An important effect of TG is the inhibition of cell proliferation in parallel with depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (6Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Adv. Second Mess. Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 265-308PubMed Google Scholar). It is of interest that DC-3F cells develop resistance to TG and continue to proliferate following gradual exposure to increasing concentrations of the inhibitor (8Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a 2-3-fold overexpression of the multidrug resistance transporter p-glycoprotein occurs in association with the development of resistance to TG, this modest overexpression of the drug transporter does not account for the very large (more than 2 orders of magnitude) increase in resistance of DC-3F cells to TG (8Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, with the experiments described in this report we attempted to clarify whether SERCA ATPases are directly involved in the mechanism of TG resistance. A most important finding is that microsomes obtained from cells exposed for a long time to inhibitory concentrations of TG retain residual Ca2+ transport activity. This demonstrates that, under our experimental conditions, resistance to TG is due to factors related directly to the ATPase.It has been clearly demonstrated that, due to its extremely high affinity, the amount of TG required to inhibit isolated wild-type ATPase is stoichiometrically equivalent to the target protein, even when the ATPase is present at subnanomolar concentrations (2Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, the higher TG concentration required to obtain inhibition of microsomes obtained from the DC-3F/CaTG cells (Fig. 5B) may be related to the higher ATPase content of these microsomes, in addition to the presence of TG-resistant ATPase within these cells. On the other hand, the disproportionately high concentrations of TG (Fig. 5B) required to inhibit the very low amount of ATPase (Figs. 5A and 6) recovered from the (nontransfected) DC-3F/TG cells must be attributed to a distinct, TG-resistant SERCA ATPase, which may correspond to an endogenous isoform selected during the induction of TG resistance. Therefore, the TG-resistant cells developed in our experiments contain two ATPase populations: a population which is inactivated by stoichiometric titration with TG (prevalent in the transfected DC-3F/CaTG cells) and a population which is resistant to TG and derives in DC-3F/CaTG from exogenous and/or endogenous ATPase, and in DC-3F/TG from an endogenous isoform.The overexpression of the TG sensitive SERCA, in addition to the TG-resistant SERCA, indicates that the experimental protocol used here favors the selection of cells with high expression of SERCA ATPases. Resistance to TG then develops in parallel with (a) selection of cells expressing high level of SERCA ATPases and (b) selection of a TG-resistant SERCA ATPase isoform. It is apparent that overexpression of SERCA1 and SERCA2 ATPases does not completely account for the TG resistance acquired by the DC-3F/CaTG and DC-3F/TG cells. Ultimately, selection of a TG-resistant SERCA ATPase is required to provide sufficient function to sustain cytosolic Ca2+ housekeeping and proliferation of TG-resistant cells. The TG-resistant ATPase could derive from a “latent” inherently resistant endogenous SERCA isoform which may be present in at least a few of the DC-3F cells. The latter suggestion is consistent with the known presence of TG-resistant SERCA ATPase isoforms in platelets (19Tao J. Haynes D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24972-24982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in association with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate-insensitive Ca2+ stores (20Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Wang J.C. Gill D.L. J.

In this study, to identify the minimum PS-binding region of MARCKS and the regulatory phosphorylation site, the binding of MARCKS to PS was examined in deletion mutants producing glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The mutant proteins GST-6-180 and GST-127-160 had almost the same ability to bind to immobilized PS as MARCKS purified from rat brain, whereas GST-127-152 did not bind to it. In addition, the binding of GST-6-156 to immobilized PS was 62% of that of GST-6-180, but that of GST-6-152 was only 8% and that of GST-6-135 was not detected. The effect of phosphorylation by protein kinase C was examined in several mutants of GST-6-180 whose serine residues were substituted with alanine. After phosphorylation, the mutants GST-6-180[S156A and S163A], GST-6-180[S156A], and GST-6-180[S163A] did not bind to immobilized PS like native MARCKS and GST-6-180. However, even after phosphorylation, GST-6-180[S152A] and GST-6-180[S152A and S156A] could bind to immobilized PS.These results strongly suggest that MARCKS binds to PS molecules in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane through residues 127-156, with residues 153-156 (FKKS) being particularly important in the binding of MARCKS to PS, and that the binding is regulated through the protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of the serine at residue 152.

https://openalex.org/W2003329920,"The focal adhesion kinase, pp125FAK, is a novel non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase expressed in different cells including mast cells. Here we report that a 77-kDa protein associates with pp125FAK in the mast cell analog, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. When pp125FAK immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay, there was prominent phosphorylation on tyrosine of pp125FAK and of a 77-kDa protein. By V8 protease digestion mapping and by immunoblotting with two different anti-pp125FAK antibodies, the 77-kDa protein was distinct from pp125FAK. This Fak Associated Protein or FAP was detected in RBL-2H3 cells but not in fibroblasts. The aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor, FceRI, induced the in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of FAP. However, there was a marked decrease in the in vitro phosphorylation of FAP in the immunoprecipitates from FceRI aggregated cells. Both of these FceRI-mediated effects were enhanced by cell adhesion. There was strong association of FAP with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated pp125FAK. Thus this interaction does not appear to be mediated by the Src homology 2 domain. Together the data indicate that FAP associates with pp125FAK and suggest that FAP may play a role in FceRI signaling."

Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The mutational activation of the Ha-ras gene in keratinocytes has been shown to occur during the initiation step in the mouse skin model for multistage carcinogenesis (3Brown K. Quintanilla M. Ramsden M. Kerr I.B. Young S. Balmain A. Cell. 1986; 46: 447-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Skin tumor promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulate a selective outgrowth of initiated keratinocytes to form benign tumors (papillomas) (4Van Duuren B.L. Prog. Exp. Tumor Res. 1969; 11: 31-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that determine the cooperativity between an activated Ha-ras and a tumor promoter remain largely unknown. However, it is assumed that altered gene expression caused by the presence of an activated ras oncogene in conjunction with TPA-induced protein kinase C activity results in imbalance between keratinocyte growth and terminal differentiation. In order to elucidate differences and similarities in signaling elicited by TPA and an activated Ha-ras gene in keratinocytes, we have used the LTR of a VL30 retrotransposon (B10) expressed in mouse epidermis to identify sequences and transcription factors activated in keratinocytes during these two phases of tumor development.

Bocco J.L. Goetz J. Gaire M. Lutz Y. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 375-985PubMed Google Scholar). Several identified DNA elements mediating induced transcription in response to both an activated ras gene and TPA contain two cooperating binding sites in juxtaposed positions that are recognized by different classes of transcription factors (10Wasylyk B.

Here we report the identification of a novel type of RRE present in the LTR of a VL30 member (B10) expressed in mouse epidermis. This 20-bp sequence mediates induced transcription in keratinocytes in response to both EGF and an activated Ha-ras gene. The RRE is distinct from a TPA response element previously identified within the same LTR, and it does not mediate induced transcription in response to TPA. These results show that two different signal pathways that cooperate in mouse skin carcinogenesis can act through different nuclear targets. A characterization reveals that the identified RRE is composed of two cooperating sequence motifs that are target for EGF-induced binding activity corresponding to specific members within the AP1/ATF family of transcription factors and a novel 178-kDa nuclear factor, respectively. epidermal growth factor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate electrophoretic mobility shift assay chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis long terminal repeat cAMP-responsive element ras-responsive element CRE binding protein activating transcription factor base pair(s) serum response element.

Cells treated with TPA were incubated with 100 ng/ml TPA (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for the final 16 h, and EGF-treated cells were EGF-starved for 30 h prior to EGF treatment (10 ng/ml for 16 h).

Gradients were centrifuged in a SW60-Ti rotor in a Beckman L8-M centrifuge at 260,000- 300,000× g for 15 h to a preset cumulative centrifugal effect (ω2t) of 1.7× 1012 rad2/s. Fractions of 150 μl were collected from the bottom of the tube by gravity flow. Catalase (11.3 S) and γ-globulin (6.6 S) were used as external sedimentation markers and detected by measuring the optical density of fractions at 280 nm. A Superose 12 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was equilibrated in GS buffer. The column was calibrated with albumin, ovalbumin, DNase I, and cytochrome c. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min, the sample volumes were less than 2% of the total column volume, and 0.4-ml fractions were collected. The calculations of molecular parameters were performed according to Siegel and Monty (28Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). The Stokes radii (Rs) were determined graphically from a plot of -log Stokes radii versus Ve/V0, where V0and V0 are the elution volume of the factor and the void volume of the column, respectively. The molecular weight in solution was calculated with the assumption that the partial specific volume of the macromolecule was 0.725 cm3/g and that the solvation factor was 0.2 g of solvent/g of solute, both of which are typical values of proteins (29Tanford L. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, New York1961: 34Google Scholar). The molecular weight and frictional ratio were calculated using the equation Mr = 422SRsand f/f0= 1.393 (Rs/Mr⅓), respectively (28Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar, 30Sherman M.R. Methods Enymol. 1975; 36: 211-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have previously used the LTR of the VL30 clone B10 to identify sequences and nuclear factors mediating induced transcription in keratinocytes in response to the skin tumor promoter TPA (14Nilsson M. Bohm S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 276-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study if this LTR in addition could mediate induced transcription in response to an event mimicking tumor initiation, we employed transient transfection experiments using a B10 LTR-driven reporter gene plasmid together with expression vectors coding for either the normal or the activated form (Ras-Val-12) of the human c-Ha-Ras oncoprotein, respectively. The reporter gene plasmid (B10.U3) contained the U3-region of the B10 LTR fused to a CAT reporter gene. Fig. 1 shows that the VL30 LTR present in B10.U3 mediated a 10-fold increased CAT activity when a Balb/MK mouse keratinocyte cell line was co-transfected with a plasmid expressing the oncogenic Ha-ras gene (ras*). No enhanced CAT activity was detected in cells transfected with a plasmid expressing the normal form of the c-Ha-ras gene (ras) or a control plasmid (pUC9, data not shown). To determine the minimal sequence required for ras-induced VL30 transcription, we performed CAT assays using a number of plasmid constructs (Fig. 1), which contained different deletions in the U3 region of the B10 LTR. Fig. 1 shows that activated Ha-ras gene expression in Balb/MK cells resulted in a 10-50-fold stimulation of CAT activity from the B10.U3, B10.Stu, and B10.SnaRep plasmids. The relative low -fold induction obtained with the B10.U3 plasmid (9.7 fold) compared with B10.Stu (25.4-fold) and B10.SnaRep (48.6-fold) was reproducible and indicated that the sequence 5’ to the StuI site repressed inducibility. The B10 LTR contains a direct repeat of two 35-bp sequences (indicated with arrows in Fig. 1) (15Bohm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24834-24841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No ras-induced transcription was obtained with plasmids that lacked both repeat units (B10.StuSna and B10.Sna). This observation led us to construct a plasmid that contained one repeat unit by ligating a 20-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5’ end of one repeat unit to the SnaBI site of B10.Sna. Interestingly, the 20-bp sequence restored the ras responsiveness (compare B10.Sna with B10.SnaRep). To determine if the 20-base pair sequence alone was sufficient to mediate ras-induced transcription, we cloned an oligonucleotide corresponding to this sequence 5’ to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in a luciferase reporter plasmid (pT109). As shown in Fig. 2A, this plasmid, termed B10 RRE.Luc, mediated a 4-fold induction when cotransfected together with the vector expressing an activated Ha-ras gene as compared with cells transfected with a plasmid expressing the normal c-Ha-ras gene. This result demonstrated that the 20-bp sequence functioned as a RRE. Next we investigated if the identified RRE was a nuclear target for a signal pathway stimulated through the EGF receptor. We analyzed the capacity of the B10 RRE.Luc in mediating EGF-induced transcription. The result shown in Fig. 2A indicated that this assumption was correct in that the B10 RRE.Luc responded with a 4-fold induction of luciferase activity after readdition of EGF to cells cultivated in the absence of EGF for 30 h. We have previously identified a nonconsensus CRE/ATF-site that binds CREB- and Jun-related proteins and cooperates with a juxtaposed p65NFk/c-Rel-binding site in mediating TPA-induced transcription in keratinocytes (15Bohm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24834-24841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nilsson M. Bohm S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 276-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence (VLTRE) is situated 27 base pairs 3’ to the B10 RRE and is unresponsive to EGF (15Bohm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24834-24841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We wanted to rule out that the RRE was responsive to TPA. Fig. 2B shows that VLTRE inserted 5’ to the thymidine kinase promoter in the pT109 plasmid (VLTRE.Luc) responded to TPA treatment with a 4-fold increase in luciferase activity, whereas B10 RRE.Luc was unresponsive to the same treatment. Taken together, these results suggested that the B10 RRE was responsive to an EGF/Ha-ras-signal pathway that is not induced by the protein kinase C-activator and tumor promoter TPA. Owen et al.(16Owen R.D. Bortner D.M. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have identified a RRE in the LTR of another VL30 designated NVL3. The NVL3 RRE is similar to several previously identified RREs in that it is composed of an AP1-binding site adjacent to a PEA3/Ets-binding site. Fig. 2C shows a sequence alignment of the two RREs that revealed sequence differences both in the AP1-like site and flanking sequences. Since the NVL3 RRE was identified using NIH/3T3 cells, we analyzed if the capacity to mediate Ha-ras-induced transcription differed between the two RREs when analyzed in Balb/MK and NIH/3T3 cells, respectively. A luciferase reporter plasmid containing the NVL3 RRE upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter was constructed and used in co-transfection experiments (Fig. 2C, NVL3 RRE.Luc). As shown in Fig. 2C, the NVL3 RRE was found to be functional in both cell types mediating a 4-fold induction of luciferase activity. Interestingly, in contrast to the NVL3 RRE, the B10 RRE was found to be inactive in the fibroblast cell line, whereas it mediated a 4-fold induction in keratinocytes. This result indicated that the B10 and the NVL3 RRE mediated ras-induced transcription by different mechanisms. The 20-base pair B10 RRE sequence is shown in Fig. 2C. It contained a motif, TGACTCC, which deviates from a canonical AP1-site, TGACTCA, with one nucleotide. To further characterize the sequence requirement of Ha-ras-induced transcription, oligonucleotides containing substitutions within the AP1-like site and its flanking sequences were synthesized (Fig. 3, M1-M4). Plasmids containing these oligonucleotides upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter in the pT109 luciferase reporter gene plasmid were cotransfected with Ha-ras expression vectors. Fig. 3 shows the -fold induction mediated by these plasmids in response to an activated Ha-ras gene relative to the activity obtained in cells transfected with the normal Ha-ras gene. The result from this experiment demonstrated that the nucleotide substitutions in the AP1-like site (M2.Luc) abolished ras-responsiveness. Interestingly, mutations both 5’ (M1.Luc) and 3’ (M3- and M4.Luc) to the AP1-like site also inhibited the capacity of the B10 RRE to mediate induced transcription. This result indicated that the AP1-like site alone was not sufficient to mediate transcription induced by a mutated ras gene. In order to identify possible qualitative and/or quantitative differences in DNA-protein complex formation, we performed EMSA. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4A, we used an oligonucleotide corresponding to B10 RRE as probe and nuclear extracts prepared prior to and after readdition of EGF (10 ng/ml) to cells cultivated without EGF for 48 h. Interestingly, several complexes were identified that showed induced formation 1-2 h after addition of EGF. Three complexes (designated 1, 2, and 3) were formed in a sequence-specific manner as judged from the ability of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled B10 RRE to compete for complex formation, whereas a p65NFk/c-REL-binding site (VLY) in the same molar excess was without effect (Fig. 4B). In accordance with the functional results, no induced binding activity corresponding to complex 1, 2, and 3 was detected in nuclear extracts prepared from EGF-starved cells treated for 1 and 2 h with TPA (data not shown). TPA-induced binding activity could, however, be detected in the same nuclear extracts using the VLY probe (14, and data not shown). To analyze if the sequences required for complex formation correlated with those required for functionality, we used unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the different mutated variants shown in Fig. 3 in competition experiments. The oligonucleotide that contained a mutated AP1-like site (M2) specifically competed for the formation of complex 1 and 2 while leaving complex 3 unaffected. The same pattern of competition was observed using the oligonucleotide-containing mutations 5’ to the AP1-like site (M1). An opposite result was obtained using an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to mutations 3’ to the AP1-like site. These oligonucleotides (M3 and M4) specifically competed for the formation of complex 3. The reciprocal capacity of M2 and M3 to form complexes with nuclear extract was also evident using these two oligonucleotides as probes (Fig. 4C). These results, together with the results from the functional analysis, thus indicated that the B10 RRE was composed of two binding sites that cooperated in function. One of the sites was positioned immediately 5’ and within the AP1-like site while the other was located 3’ to the AP1-like site. The binding characteristics of the B10 RRE probe were further analyzed by competition experiments using nuclear Balb/MK extract and a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides corresponding to binding sites for transcription factors known to be involved in mediating ras-induced transcription. Fig. 5A shows that an oligonucleotide (AP1), which contained the consensus AP1-site present in the collagenase gene, specifically competed for the formation of complex 3, suggesting that the AP1-like site indeed was a target for AP1-binding activity. However, in the reverse experiment, using a consensus AP-1-binding site as a probe and an excess of B10 RRE as competitor only a partial inhibition of AP1-binding was observed (data not shown). This result suggested that the B10 RRE, displayed a lower affinity and/or a restricted binding specificity for AP1-binding activity. No inhibition of B10 RRE complex formation was detected using an oligonucleotide corresponding to the SRE present in the c-fos gene. Interestingly, the formation of complex 3 was inhibited when competing with an oligonucleotide corresponding to a consensus CRE present in the choriogonadotropin gene (Fig. 5A), which suggested the presence of CREB/ATF-proteins in this complex. An oligonucleotide corresponding to a NVL3 RRE also competed for complex 3 formation due to the presence of an AP1-site. This result indicated that the PEA3/Ets-binding site in the NVL3 RRE was without effect. In agreement with this result, no competition was detected using an oligonucleotide (PEA3) that corresponded to the Ets1- and Ets2-binding sites present in the polyoma virus enhancer (10Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a reverse experiment using the PEA3/Ets binding site as a probe and a 100-fold molar excess of a B10 RRE as competitor, no competition was observed to PEA3/Ets binding activity (data not shown). These results indicated that the B10 RRE-binding factors were unrelated to PEA3/Ets. Next, we wanted to identify the proteins present in the different DNA-protein complexes. Given the finding that both AP1-sites and a CRE competed for binding to the B10 RRE, we performed gel shift analyses using antisera specific for proteins known to bind to these sequences. Fig. 5B shows that the anti-c-Jun and anti-JunD antibodies specifically disrupted complex 3 as did a polyclonal antiserum raised against CREB. Moreover, a supershift was generated using anti-JunB antibodies (indicated with an arrow in Fig. 5B), while an anti-c-Fos antibody had no effect on complex formation. The anti-c-Fos and all anti-Jun antibodies generated supershifts when using the collagenase AP1-site as a probe (data not shown). This result was in agreement with the oligonucleotide competition experiments and indicated that complex 3 contained Jun- and CREB-related factors, whereas complex 1 and 2 contained proteins unrelated to these transcription factors. In order to identify the specific CREB/ATF-proteins that bound to the B10 RRE probe, we used antibodies specific for different CREB/ATF members. As shown in Fig. 5C, an antibody that specifically recognize ATF3 disrupted formation of complex 3, whereas anti-ATF1, -ATF2, -CREB1, and -CREB2 had no effect. This suggested that complex 3 was composed of several complexes with similar mobility and that these contained homo- and/or heterodimers of ATF3 and different Jun isotypes. The results indicated that the sequence, TTAGTTAC, immediately 3’ to the AP1-like site was both essential for functionality and bound protein(s) unrelated to transcription factors known to be involved in ras-induced transcription (complex 1 and 2 in Fig. 3). A computer search revealed no significant similarity between the sequence TTAGTTAC and previously published transcription factor binding site"
