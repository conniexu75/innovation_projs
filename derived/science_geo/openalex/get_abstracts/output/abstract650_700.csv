https://openalex.org/W1607682771,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was purified from rabbit small intestine to apparent homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical ultracentrifugation. The native enzyme was a monomeric protein of a molecular weight of 41,000 +/- 1,000 with an s020,w value of 3.45 S. It had a relative abundance of hydrophobic amino acids such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine, and contained approximately 5% carbohydrate by weight. The estimated content of sugar residues per mol of enzyme was: galactose, 1.2; mannose, 2.6; N-acetylglucosamine, 5.2; and sialic acid, 0.8. One mole of enzyme had 0.8 mol of protoheme IX as a prosthetic group. However, copper was not detected in a significant amount and the ratio of copper to heme was less than 0.03. EPR spectra of the nitric oxide complex of the ferrous enzyme indicated that a nitrogen atom, possibly in an imidazole group, might be coordinated as the fifth ligand of the heme coenzyme. The anisotropic g values were gx = 2.08, gy = 1.98, and gz = 2.01. A single enzyme protein catalyzed the oxygenative ring cleavage of D- and L-tryptophan, D- and L-5-hydroxytryptophan, tryptamine, and serotonin. In addition, the purified enzyme had a peroxidase activity with guaiacol and potassium iodide as hydrogen donors, but not a catalase activity."

Such processes have been related both to neurotransmitters and to neuromodulators, together termed neuroregulators. Available research tools and theoretical constructs have begun to permit studies of certain types of behavior, primarily those related to emotional states and drives. This work is changing long-held concepts about severe mental disorders and the treatment of them."

https://openalex.org/W73313321,"An ultracentrifugation assay has been developed to measure low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity in membranes prepared from cultured human fibroblasts. The binding site for 125I-labeled LDL in isolated membranes reflected the properties of the LDL receptor previously demonstrated in intact fibroblasts. It exhibited high affinity (Kd approximately 4 microgram of LDL protein/ml), specificity (LDL approximately 400-fold more effective than high density lipoprotein in competing with 125I-LDL for the binding site), dependence on calcium, and susceptibility to destruction by pronase. The number of LDL receptors detected in the in vitro membrane binding assay was similar to the number detected in intact cells. The number of receptors was reduced in membranes from fibroblasts that were grown in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol plus cholesterol and in fibroblast membranes from a subject with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, two situations in which the number of LDL receptors in intact fibroblasts is known to be reduced. The availability of a membrane binding assay that faithfully reflects the properties of the physiologic LDL receptor of intact cells should permit the characterization of this receptor in organs from intact humans and animals."

https://openalex.org/W1509276235,"The alpha-methyl and alpha-ethyl analogs of methionine sulfoximine, like methionine sulfoximine, induce convulsions in mice and inhibit glutamine synthetase irreversibly; alpha-ethylmethionine sulfoximine is approximately 50% as inhibitory as methionine sulfoximine and alpha-methylmethionine sulfoximine. However, whereas alpha-methylmethionine sulfoximine and methionine sulfoximine inhibit gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase markedly, alpha-ethylmethionine sulfoximine does not, nor does administration of the alpha-ethyl analog produce the decrease in tissue glutathione levels found after giving methionine sulfoximine or its alpha-methyl analog. The findings strongly indicate that methionine sulfoximine-induced convulsions are closely associated with inhibition of glutamine synthetase rather than with inhibition of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. The alpha-alkyl methionine sulfoximine analogs cannot be catabolized via the corresponding alpha-keto or alpha-imino acids, and, like other alpha-substituted amino acids, are probably not metabolized to a significant extent in vivo; this suggests that the amino acid sulfoximine molecules themselves, rather than their metabolites, are directly involved in the induction of convulsions. Possible explanations for the reported lack of correlation between the occurrence of convulsions and the levels of glutamine synthetase activity (and its substrates and product) are considered. The findings suggest that studies on the mechanism of induction of convulsions may be extended significantly and refined in biochemical terms by the use of other structurally modified convulsant molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1606830445,"Saturation curves of activity versus concentration were determined for aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli (EC 2.1.3.2) for the substrate L-aspartate at saturating carbamyl phosphate (4.8 mM) in buffered solution at pH values from 6.0 to 12.0. Hill coefficients were obtained from the sigmoidal curves. At pH values from 7.8 to 9.1, where substrate inhibition causes difficulties in the Hill approximation, our kinetic scheme includes substrate inhibition and residual activity in the abortive enzyme-substrate complex. The plot of Hill coefficient versus pH has pKalpha values of 7.4 and 9.8 at the half-maximum positions of the curve which has a plateau from pH 8.1 to 9.1. These pKalpha values may be associated with functional groups involved in the allosteric transition which activates the enzyme. A plot of [S]0.5 versus pH shows a pKalpha of 8.5, which may belong to a residue either at or near the aspartate binding site. At 50 mM aspartate concentration the pH-rate profile shows maxima at pH values of 8.8 and 10.0 (cf. Weitzman, P.D.J., and Wilson, I.B.(1966)J. Biol. Chem. 2418 5481-5488, who used 100 mM aspartate). However, when the pH-dependent substrate inhibition is included, the calculated Vmax--H curve is bell-shaped like that of the isolated catalytic subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2419505862,"Messenger RNA specific for tyrosine aminotransferase was quantitated by microinjection into oocytes of Xenopus laevis. The heterologously translated enzyme was identified by specific immunoprecipitation and found to be identical with authentic aminotransferase by several criteria. The level of functional message present in rat liver increases during hydrocortisone induction, and this increase is directly proportional to the increased rate of synthesis of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis of the changes in tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA levels during induction and withdrawal indicates that the steroid does not affect the stability of the message, which has a half-life of approximately 1.2 h. Hydrocortisone, therefore, acts to increase the rate of synthesis of the specific messenger by stimulating either its transcription or processing to functional mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1563232523,"Membrane preparations isolated from the photosynthetic lamellae of the cyanobacterium Plectonema boryanum generate upon illumination a transmembrane pH gradient of approximately 2 to 3 pH units (acid inside), as determined from the distribution of either fluorescent or radioactive amines (9 aminoacridine and [14C]methylamine, respectively). Using the distribution of permeant ions to measure the electrical potential across the membrane, it was found that the latter is practically nil under conditions in which the deltapH is formed and photophosphorylation takes place. In agreement with the above findings cyclic photophosphorylation in this membrane preparation is inhibited by agents shown to collapse the deltapH but not by agents which should collapse the electrical potential. It is deduced that the pattern of proton movement in the photosynthetic lamellae of intact Plectonema spheroplasts corresponds to that of the cell-free membrane system, as both preparations show similar light dependent accumulation of fluorescent amine. It is concluded that the pattern of energy transduction in Plectonema photosynthetic lamellae is similar to that of chloroplast thylakoid membranes and not to that of bacterial cytoplasmic membranes. The evolutionary implications of the findings are discussed and a model for the directionality of H+ movements in the whole cell is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1541962917,"Digitonin treatment of chick liver cells in monolayer culture perforates the plasma membrane, causing release of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and other cytosolic enzymes. The rate of carboxylase release is affected by conditions known to alter the position of the protomer-polymer (filament) equilibrium of the enzyme. Citrate, an allosteric activator of the carboxylase, induces polymerization of the protomeric avidin-sensitive form giving rise to the avidin-insensitive polymeric filamentous form. When cells are exposed to N6,O2-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate which lowers intracellular citrate levels, the rate of carboxylase release from digitonin-treated cells is greatly accelerated. The presence of avidin, which rapidly enters the cell during digitonin treatment, inactivates carboxylase under conditions that promote depolymerization and rapid release, but not under conditions which promote polymerization and slow release. These findings indicate that carboxylase filaments exist in the intact chick liver cell when the cytoplasmic citrate level is high and undergo depolymerization when citrate levels fall."
https://openalex.org/W91025472,"We report experiments describing the isolation and characterization of ornithine transcarbamylase from normal human liver. Our preparative procedure employs initial centrifugation and heat steps, intermediate batch-wise adsorption and desorption from ion exchange resins and column chromatographic elution from hydroxylapatite, and final purification by gel filtration chromatography and glycerol density gradient centrifugation. The enzyme, purified 580-fold in this way, is homogeneous as judged by native and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Human ornithine transcarbamylase has a molecular weight of 114,000 and is a trimer of identical 38,000 molecular weight subunits. It focuses at pH 6.8 as a single band on polyacrylamide gel, has a COOH-terminal phenylalanine, an NH2-terminal glycine, an apparent Km for L-ornithine of 0.4 mM and for carbamyl phosphate of 0.16 mM, and a pH optimum of 7.7. The enzyme is quite stable over a temperature range from -50 degrees to +60 degrees C and over the pH range from 5.8 to 8.2. The quaternary structure and amino acid composition of the human enzyme are very similar to those of its bovine homologue."
https://openalex.org/W1555589103,"The specific beta-adrenergic agonist radioligand (+/-)-[3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol ([3H]HBI) was used to investigate alterations in the beta-adrenergic receptors of frog erythrocytes occurring during the process of agonist-induced, receptor-specific desensitization. There was close agreement between the percentage fall in [3H]HBI binding and that in catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity following periods of preincubation of up to 7 h with 0.1 mM (-)-isoproterenol. Desensitization was maximal by 5 h, resulting in a 69% reduction in [3H]HBI binding and a 67% reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. In contrast, binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol was significantly less affected by desensitization (p is less than 0.05 at 2 1/2, 5, and 7 h), showing a maximum reduction in binding of only 35% in these experiments. The consistent close agreement of reduction in agonist binding with that in hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, together with the significant difference observed between agonist and antagonist binding, implies that an alteration occurs during desensitization which preferentially interferes with agonist binding, while antagonist binding is less affected. The locus of this agonist-specific alteration may be the receptor binding site or a site involved in receptor-enzyme coupling. Agonist binding studies may now be used to assess more completely the desensitized state of beta-adrenergic receptors in systems in which marked desensitization of beta-adrenergic responses is associated with little or no reduction in antagonist binding."
https://openalex.org/W1664496724,"The phenylalanine-sensitive 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (7-phospho-2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptonate D-erythrose-4-phosphate lyase (pyruvate phosphorylating), EC 4.2.1.15) was purified to apparent homogeneity from extracts of Escherichia coli K12. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 140,000 as judged by gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium analysis. The enzyme has a subunit molecular weight of 35,000 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting that the native form of the enzyme is a tetramer. This was confirmed by cross-linking the enzyme with dimethylsuberimidate and by analyzing the cross-linked material by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The enzyme shows a narrow pH optimum between pH 6.5 and 7.0. The enzyme is stable for several months when stored at -20 degrees C in buffers containing phosphoenolpyruvate. Removal of phosphoenolpyruvate causes an irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by L-phenylalanine and to a lesser degree by dihydrophenylalanine. Molecular parameters of the previously isolated tyrosine-sensitive 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase from E. coli (Schoner, R., and Herrmann, K.M. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5440-5447) are compared with those of the phenylalanine-sensitive isoenzyme from the same organism."

The methylated peptides were resolved using gel electrophoresis under acidic conditions in the presence of N-cetylpyridinium chloride. There was a selective methylation of two groups of membrane peptides which did not correspond to any of the chromaffin granule soluble proteins. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase, an acidic protein accounting for up to 25% of the membrane proteins, was a poor substrate for protein carboxylmethylase. The methyl esters of membrane proteins were more labile than those of the chromaffin granule soluble proteins. At all pH values tested, membrane protein-methyl esters were hydrolyzed three times more rapidly than the soluble protein-methyl esters."

Consistently, the pH optimum of beta-galactosidase, as assayed in cell extracts, is between pH 6.0 and 6.5. An electrical potential (delta-psi), interior positive, is also maintained across the membrane. A delta-psi of approximately 34 mV was calculated from determinations of thiocyanate uptake by cells at pH 3.5. Addition of the proton conductor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone increased the delta-psi. Treatment of cells with valinomycin (in the absence of external potassium ions) or high concentrations of thiocyanate, to abolish the delta psi, resulted in collapse of the transmembrane proton gradient (delta pH). Active transport of methylthio-beta, D-galactoside occurred optimally at pH 3.5. Transport of the galactoside was inhibited by various compounds which could dissipate the transmembrane delta pH and by respiratory inhibitors. A decrease in the delta pH and an increase in the delta psi occurred upon addition of methylthio-beta, D-galactoside to cells of B. acidocaldarius. Thus the transport of this solute appears to involve an electrogenic symport with protons. The transport system is most active at 50 degrees C and shows little activity at 25 degrees C, although the delta pH is the same at the two temperatures. Gramicidin inhibits methylthio-beta, D-galactoside transport equally effectively at 50 degrees C and 25 degrees C, while nigericin inhibits only after a lag at 25 degrees C."

Magnesium ion and various combinations of substrates and products confer differing degrees of protection against cystamine inactivation, thus allowing the detection and quantification of certain enzyme-ligand interactions. By measuring inactivation rates as a function of ligand concentrations in incomplete reaction mixtures, we have obtained evidence for the following complexes: enzyme . Mg2+; enzyme . Mg2+ . MgATP2-; enzyme . Mg2+ . L-glutamate; enzyme . Mg2+ . MgATP2- . L-glutamate; enzyme . Mg2+ . L-gamma-glutamyl-L-alpha-aminobutyrate. The data also imply the existence of enzyme . (Mg2+)2 . MgATP2- . L-glutamate and several enzyme forms resulting from the weak binding to L-alpha-aminobutyrate. The methods used permit the calculation of cystamine inactivation rates for most of these enzyme forms and also give values for the equilibrium constants describing their formation."
https://openalex.org/W1495656874,"Samples of microtubule protein prepared by repeated cycles of assembly-disassembly were examined at low temperatures by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation. Sedimenting boundaries corresponding to the 6 S tubulin subunit as well as to two oligomeric species with s020,w values of 18.6 S and 30.6 S were observed. The 30 S to 6 S mass ratio varied with total protein concentration, suggesting that a concentration-dependent equilibrium exists between 6 S and oligomeric species of tubulin. A study of the effects of pH on the mass distribution among the species demonstrated that the 6 S species was favored at low pH values (5.8 to 6.5), the 30 S oligomer was favored at moderate pH values (6.5 to 7.4), and the 18 S oligomer was formed in increasing proportions at higher pH values (7.4 to 8.2). Incubation of purified microtubule protein solutions with increasing concentrations of NaCl initially favored conversion of the 30 S oligomer to the 18 S species with further increases in salt concentration resulting in the dissolution of both the 30 S and 18 S oligomers. The depolymerizing effects of high salt concentrations were substantially reversible, providing further evidence for 6 S-oligomer equilibria. The manipulation of the solution variables of pH and ionic strength in a systematic fashion led to the construction of a phase diagram for the microtubule protein species which provided a relatively complete description of the mass distribution among the 6 S, 18 S, and 30 S species over a range of physiological and near-physiological solution conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1532305993,"Polyacrylamide and starch gel electrophoresis of the hemoglobin of the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus reveal the presence of four clearly distinguishable components. These isohemoglobins, each tetramers consisting of alpha and beta chains, can be preparatively separated by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and are homogeneous according to isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels. Oxygen equilibria of the isolated hemoglobin components (Hb I, Hb II, Hb III, and Hb IV) show only minor differences in the magnitude of the Bohr effect and in the effect of ATP on the binding of oxygen. Four different globin chains, alphaa, alphab, betaa, and betab, can be separated by ion exchange on CM-cellulose. Hb I is a homotetramer of alphab and betab chains, Hb IV consists of alphaa and betaa subunits, and components II and III are heterotetramers consisting of all four chains. The alpha and beta chains differ significantly in amino acid composition. A model suggesting the existence of 10 different isohemoglobins, 6 of which have stable intersubunit contacts, has been proposed to account for the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the electrophoretic behavior of the components. Separations of the isohemoglobins on DEAE-cellulose under slightly modified conditions provide additional support for the model."

At alkaline pH CO binding and dissociation are homogeneous, with rate constants of 1.3 PM-’ s-’ and 0.028 s-‘, respectively; these were assigned as the R state rates for both chains. Full and partial flash photolysis data were collected over the pH range 6.0 to 8.5, and CO equilibrium data from 6.0 to 7.5. These were fit to the twostate model modified to include chain differences. The T and R binding rates, and the R dissociation rate, were assigned; L and the T dissociation rates were calculated. L varies from 4 x lo7 at pH 6.0 to 8 at pH 8.5; the T rates vary from 0.15 and 0.25 at pH 6.0 to 0.02 at pH 8.5. Both Hb and carbon monoxide hemoglobin (HbCO) have pH difference spectra in the Soret and visible regions. The Hb spectrum changes above pH 7.5 and the HbCO spectrum changes below pH 7.0. The transition from R to T state was observed at an Hb-HbCO isosbestic during flash photolysis of HbCO. The total absorbance change at this w-avelength rises, then falls with pH, with a maximum at pH 7.0. The time course of conformation change at pH 7.0 was followed after full and partial flash photolysis and fit to the extended two-state model with an L value of lo” and a 3-fold decrease in the rate of R to T transition for each additional bound CO. The magnitude of static and kinetic absorption changes was compared to the conformation state of Hb and HbCO calculated from the functional measurements. There is poor correlation; both spectral measurements indicate a too great effect of pH on the conformation of both derivatives. It is suggested that optical absorption measurements do not give a quantitative measure of quaternary conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1503650815,"Several protein synthesis inhibitors were as effective as the inducers hydrocortisone or cyclic AMP in elevating rat liver tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA levels when assayed in the wheat germ cell-free translational system. Cycloheximide, emetine, or puromycin increased this mRNA activity 6- to 7-fold within 4 h after in vivo administration. No increase in total hepatic mRNA levels or tryptophan oxygenase mRNA was found after treatment with these protein synthesis inhibitors. Furthermesults suggest that a short lived protein may specifically regulate the level of functional hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase mRNA or that ongoing translation of this mRNA is required for its degradation."

https://openalex.org/W1584016603,Native aspartate transcarbamoylase from Escherichia coli was modified with the bifunctional reagent tartaryl diazide in the presence of the substrate carbamoyl phosphate and the substrate analog succinate. The product had the same sedimentation coefficient as the native enzyme but showed a marked increase in affinity for the substrate aspartate with a hyperbolic saturation curve. The Michaelis constant for aspartate (7.4 mM) is similar to that estimated for the relaxed state of the enzyme. The high substrate affinity was not produced if modification was conducted in the absence of substrate analogs or with a monofunctional reagent. The modified enzyme was also desensitized towards the allosteric effectors ATP and CTP. It appears to represent a stabilized relaxed state whose conversion to the taut state is presumably prevented by cross-linking.

When the distributions of the sphingomyelinases among the purified myelin, the total subcellular fractions heavier than myelin (greater than 0.85 M sucrose), and the microsomes were examined, the magnesium-independent sphingomyelinase was detected only in myelin, while the magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase was present in the other two fractions but not in myelin.

At 5 degrees C and in phosphate buffer both liganded and unliganded forms of ferrohemoglobin exhibit deviations from the regular pH dependence of exchange that is characteristic of cyanomethemoglobin. In oxyhemoglobin, the deviation from the normal exchange pattern is centered at pH 7.4 and is in the direction of increased exchange or solvent accessibility. The effect in deoxyhemogloin, while occurring at the same pH and being of the same order of magnitude, is in the opposite direction, thus suggesting a pH-induced conformational transition leading to a less accessible structure. The width of these pH-induced deviations in solvent accessibility is approximately 1 pH unit in both cases. We propose a model in which specific interactions between charged groups in both froms of ferrohemoglobin account for these deviations."

Similar results were obtained by analytical dialysis using zinc chloride-modified cellophane membranes. The elution volume of DNase A decreases as the pH increases between pH 4.7 and pH 9.5. This effect has been attributed to a change in the tridimensional structure of the protein and interpreted as a modification in the axial ratio due to unfolding of the polypeptide chain with increase in the apparent Stokes radius. The addition of Ca2+ produce reversion of the pH-induced changes at pH 9.5. The transition occurs when Ca2+ binds to at least two binding sites (n = 1.66 in a Hill plot) with a Kd = 8.9 X 10(-5) M and the effect appears to be cooperative. These findings support the hypothesis that Ca2+-binding to DNase A causes a conformational change that maintains a more active structure of the enzyme, especially when the pH-induced unfolding reduces its activity."

The enzyme, carbamylated at the NH,-terminal alanine (transaminase’, produced from cyanate-treated holoenzyme) or at the active site Lys-258 (transaminase*, inactivated by carbamylation of Lys-258 with KNCO), can accept phosphopyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine instead of the constitutive coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate. The spin-lattice relaxation time, T,, of the fluorine atoms in the enzyme-bound fluorinate compound is 0.12 s and the spin-spin relaxation time, TO, is 6.4 ms. Both T, and T, values remain constant after carbamylation of Lys-258. Assuming a simple treatment of the dipolar relaxation mechanisms as being due to IH-lYF interactions, a molecular rotation correlation time TV value of -80 ns is calculated for native and carbamylated enzyme. The complexes of phosphopyridoxyl trifluoroethylamine and transaminase’ or transaminase*, although catalytically inactive, retain the same affinity as those with native transaminase for the competitive inhibitors succinic acid and acetate anion. Increasing ionic strength results in increasing values for the observed pK of Lys-258 determined from a pH dependence of the rate of enzymatic inactivation by KNCO treatment. The ionic strength effects are identical with those previously observed in the pK value of the protein group"

The enzyme was also isolated in a highly active, apparently homogeneous, and stable form after reduction and treatment with iodoacetamide. The amino acid compositions and other properties of the two forms of the enzyme were very similar. Studies on the activity of the enzyme toward a variety of gamma-glutamyl amino acids and di-gamma-glutamyl amino acids showed that the enzyme is much more active toward certain di-gamma-glutamyl amino acids than toward the corresponding gamma-glutamyl amino acids; thus, the preferred substrates have the general structure gamma-Glu-gamma-Glu-NH-R in which the nature of the R moiety has relatively little effect on activity."

This enzyme from mosquito larvae was purified 1700-fold and was free of deoxyribonuclease and protease activities, which hindered previous investigations of insect polymerases. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 132,000 by gen filtration and aggregated to higher molecular weights when concentrated. With an activated DNA template, the pH optimum was 7.2 in phosphate buffer, and the Mg2+ concentration optimum was 5 to 10 mM. Polymerase activity was inhibited by the antisulfhydryl reagents, N-ethylmaleimide and p-mercuribenzoate, and by KCl. These properties indicate that the mosquito enzyme resembles mammalian alpha-polymerase but differs in its lack of inhibition to low ethanol concentrations. There was no evidence of a beta-polymerase form in the mosquito."
