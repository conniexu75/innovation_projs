https://openalex.org/W2909679049,"Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments benefit some patients with metastatic cancers, but predictive biomarkers are needed. Findings in selected cancer types suggest that tumor mutational burden (TMB) may predict clinical response to ICI. To examine this association more broadly, we analyzed the clinical and genomic data of 1,662 advanced cancer patients treated with ICI, and 5,371 non-ICI-treated patients, whose tumors underwent targeted next-generation sequencing (MSK-IMPACT). Among all patients, higher somatic TMB (highest 20% in each histology) was associated with better overall survival. For most cancer histologies, an association between higher TMB and improved survival was observed. The TMB cutpoints associated with improved survival varied markedly between cancer types. These data indicate that TMB is associated with improved survival in patients receiving ICI across a wide variety of cancer types, but that there may not be one universal definition of high TMB. Analysis of advanced cancer patients treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors shows that tumor mutational burden, as assessed by targeted next-generation sequencing, predicts survival after immunotherapy across multiple cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W2911147760,"Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment are increasingly recognized1–5 as shown by neuropathological6,7, neuroimaging4,8–11, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker4,12 studies. Moreover, small vessel disease of the brain has been estimated to contribute to approximately 50% of all dementias worldwide, including those caused by Alzheimer’s disease (AD)3,4,13. Vascular changes in AD have been typically attributed to the vasoactive and/or vasculotoxic effects of amyloid-β (Aβ)3,11,14, and more recently tau15. Animal studies suggest that Aβ and tau lead to blood vessel abnormalities and blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown14–16. Although neurovascular dysfunction3,11 and BBB breakdown develop early in AD1,4,5,8–10,12,13, how they relate to changes in the AD classical biomarkers Aβ and tau, which also develop before dementia17, remains unknown. To address this question, we studied brain capillary damage using a novel cerebrospinal fluid biomarker of BBB-associated capillary mural cell pericyte, soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β8,18, and regional BBB permeability using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging8–10. Our data show that individuals with early cognitive dysfunction develop brain capillary damage and BBB breakdown in the hippocampus irrespective of Alzheimer’s Aβ and/or tau biomarker changes, suggesting that BBB breakdown is an early biomarker of human cognitive dysfunction independent of Aβ and tau. Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analyses in humans reveal that loss of blood–brain barrier integrity and brain capillary pericyte damage are early biomarkers of cognitive impairment that occur independently of changes in amyloid-β and tau."
https://openalex.org/W2908359749,"Current methods for bioprinting functional tissue lack appropriate biofabrication techniques to build complex 3D microarchitectures essential for guiding cell growth and promoting tissue maturation1. 3D printing of central nervous system (CNS) structures has not been accomplished, possibly owing to the complexity of CNS architecture. Here, we report the use of a microscale continuous projection printing method (μCPP) to create a complex CNS structure for regenerative medicine applications in the spinal cord. μCPP can print 3D biomimetic hydrogel scaffolds tailored to the dimensions of the rodent spinal cord in 1.6 s and is scalable to human spinal cord sizes and lesion geometries. We tested the ability of µCPP 3D-printed scaffolds loaded with neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to support axon regeneration and form new 'neural relays' across sites of complete spinal cord injury in vivo in rodents1,2. We find that injured host axons regenerate into 3D biomimetic scaffolds and synapse onto NPCs implanted into the device and that implanted NPCs in turn extend axons out of the scaffold and into the host spinal cord below the injury to restore synaptic transmission and significantly improve functional outcomes. Thus, 3D biomimetic scaffolds offer a means of enhancing CNS regeneration through precision medicine."

https://openalex.org/W2909547032,"Recent genomic studies have identified chromosomal rearrangements defining new subtypes of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), however many cases lack a known initiating genetic alteration. Using integrated genomic analysis of 1,988 childhood and adult cases, we describe a revised taxonomy of B-ALL incorporating 23 subtypes defined by chromosomal rearrangements, sequence mutations or heterogeneous genomic alterations, many of which show marked variation in prevalence according to age. Two subtypes have frequent alterations of the B lymphoid transcription-factor gene PAX5. One, PAX5alt (7.4%), has diverse PAX5 alterations (rearrangements, intragenic amplifications or mutations); a second subtype is defined by PAX5 p.Pro80Arg and biallelic PAX5 alterations. We show that p.Pro80Arg impairs B lymphoid development and promotes the development of B-ALL with biallelic Pax5 alteration in vivo. These results demonstrate the utility of transcriptome sequencing to classify B-ALL and reinforce the central role of PAX5 as a checkpoint in B lymphoid maturation and leukemogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2907108807,"The findings that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients almost universally display pathological mislocalization of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 and that mutations in its gene cause familial ALS have nominated altered RNA metabolism as a disease mechanism. However, the RNAs regulated by TDP-43 in motor neurons and their connection to neuropathy remain to be identified. Here we report transcripts whose abundances in human motor neurons are sensitive to TDP-43 depletion. Notably, expression of STMN2, which encodes a microtubule regulator, declined after TDP-43 knockdown and TDP-43 mislocalization as well as in patient-specific motor neurons and postmortem patient spinal cord. STMN2 loss upon reduced TDP-43 function was due to altered splicing, which is functionally important, as we show STMN2 is necessary for normal axonal outgrowth and regeneration. Notably, post-translational stabilization of STMN2 rescued neurite outgrowth and axon regeneration deficits induced by TDP-43 depletion. We propose that restoring STMN2 expression warrants examination as a therapeutic strategy for ALS."

https://openalex.org/W2910392909,"There has been a striking generational increase in life-threatening food allergies in Westernized societies1,2. One hypothesis to explain this rising prevalence is that twenty-first century lifestyle practices, including misuse of antibiotics, dietary changes, and higher rates of Caesarean birth and formula feeding have altered intestinal bacterial communities; early-life alterations may be particularly detrimental3,4. To better understand how commensal bacteria regulate food allergy in humans, we colonized germ-free mice with feces from healthy or cow’s milk allergic (CMA) infants5. We found that germ-free mice colonized with bacteria from healthy, but not CMA, infants were protected against anaphylactic responses to a cow’s milk allergen. Differences in bacterial composition separated the healthy and CMA populations in both the human donors and the colonized mice. Healthy and CMA colonized mice also exhibited unique transcriptome signatures in the ileal epithelium. Correlation of ileal bacteria with genes upregulated in the ileum of healthy or CMA colonized mice identified a clostridial species, Anaerostipes caccae, that protected against an allergic response to food. Our findings demonstrate that intestinal bacteria are critical for regulating allergic responses to dietary antigens and suggest that interventions that modulate bacterial communities may be therapeutically relevant for food allergy. Specific members of the gut microbiota are critical for regulating allergic responses to dietary antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2910201266,"Negative capacitance is a newly discovered state of ferroelectric materials that holds promise for electronics applications by exploiting a region of thermodynamic space that is normally not accessible1–14. Although existing reports of negative capacitance substantiate the importance of this phenomenon, they have focused on its macroscale manifestation. These manifestations demonstrate possible uses of steady-state negative capacitance—for example, enhancing the capacitance of a ferroelectric–dielectric heterostructure4,7,14 or improving the subthreshold swing of a transistor8–12. Yet they constitute only indirect measurements of the local state of negative capacitance in which the ferroelectric resides. Spatial mapping of this phenomenon would help its understanding at a microscopic scale and also help to achieve optimal design of devices with potential technological applications. Here we demonstrate a direct measurement of steady-state negative capacitance in a ferroelectric–dielectric heterostructure. We use electron microscopy complemented by phase-field and first-principles-based (second-principles) simulations in SrTiO3/PbTiO3 superlattices to directly determine, with atomic resolution, the local regions in the ferroelectric material where a state of negative capacitance is stabilized. Simultaneous vector mapping of atomic displacements (related to a complex pattern in the polarization field), in conjunction with reconstruction of the local electric field, identify the negative capacitance regions as those with higher energy density and larger polarizability: the domain walls where the polarization is suppressed. Imaging steady-state negative capacitance in SrTiO3/PbTiO3 superlattices with atomic resolution provides solid microscale support for this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2952451491,"Arousal responses linked to locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NA) activity affect cognition. However, the mechanisms that control modes of LC-NA activity remain unknown. Here, we reveal a local population of GABAergic neurons (LC-GABA) capable of modulating LC-NA activity and arousal. Retrograde tracing shows that inputs to LC-GABA and LC-NA neurons arise from similar regions, though a few regions provide differential inputs to one subtype over the other. Recordings in the locus coeruleus demonstrate two modes of LC-GABA responses whereby spiking is either correlated or broadly anticorrelated with LC-NA responses, reflecting anatomically similar and functionally coincident inputs, or differential and non-coincident inputs, to LC-NA and LC-GABA neurons. Coincident inputs control the gain of LC-NA-mediated arousal responses, whereas non-coincident inputs, such as from the prefrontal cortex to the locus coeruleus, alter global arousal levels. These findings demonstrate distinct modes by which an inhibitory locus coeruleus circuit regulates arousal in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2908902954,"Cancer cells develop mechanisms to escape immunosurveillance, among which modulating the expression of immune suppressive messenger RNAs is most well-documented. However, how this is molecularly achieved remains largely unresolved. Here, we develop an in vivo mouse model of liver cancer to study oncogene cooperation in immunosurveillance. We show that MYC overexpression (MYCTg) synergizes with KRASG12D to induce an aggressive liver tumor leading to metastasis formation and reduced mouse survival compared with KRASG12D alone. Genome-wide ribosomal footprinting of MYCTg;KRASG12 tumors compared with KRASG12D revealed potential alterations in translation of mRNAs, including programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Further analysis revealed that PD-L1 translation is repressed in KRASG12D tumors by functional, non-canonical upstream open reading frames in its 5′ untranslated region, which is bypassed in MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors to evade immune attack. We show that this mechanism of PD-L1 translational upregulation was effectively targeted by a potent, clinical compound that inhibits eIF4E phosphorylation, eFT508, which reverses the aggressive and metastatic characteristics of MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors. Together, these studies reveal how immune-checkpoint proteins are manipulated by distinct oncogenes at the level of mRNA translation, which can be exploited for new immunotherapies. Oncogene cooperation enhances PD-L1 translation to promote immune evasion and metastasis in a novel model of liver cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2906753872,"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs 1, 2 and 3) have emerged as important innate immune effectors that prevent diverse virus infections in vertebrates. However, the cellular mechanisms and live-cell imaging of these small membrane proteins have been challenging to evaluate during viral entry of mammalian cells. Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated IFITM-mutant cell lines, we demonstrate that human IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 act cooperatively and function in a dose-dependent fashion in interferon-stimulated cells. Through site-specific fluorophore tagging and live-cell imaging studies, we show that IFITM3 is on endocytic vesicles that fuse with incoming virus particles and enhances the trafficking of this pathogenic cargo to lysosomes. IFITM3 trafficking is specific to restricted viruses, requires S-palmitoylation and is abrogated with loss-of-function mutants. The site-specific protein labeling and live-cell imaging approaches described here should facilitate the functional analysis of host factors involved in pathogen restriction as well as their mechanisms of regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2950122868,"The human reference genome serves as the foundation for genomics by providing a scaffold for alignment of sequencing reads, but currently only reflects a single consensus haplotype, thus impairing analysis accuracy. Here we present a graph reference genome implementation that enables read alignment across 2,800 diploid genomes encompassing 12.6 million SNPs and 4.0 million insertions and deletions (indels). The pipeline processes one whole-genome sequencing sample in 6.5 h using a system with 36 CPU cores. We show that using a graph genome reference improves read mapping sensitivity and produces a 0.5% increase in variant calling recall, with unaffected specificity. Structural variations incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework. Finally, we show that iterative augmentation of graph genomes yields incremental gains in variant calling accuracy. Our implementation is an important advance toward fulfilling the promise of graph genomes to radically enhance the scalability and accuracy of genomic analyses. Graph Genome Pipeline is a read-alignment and variant-calling pipeline based on graph genomes that offers improved read-mapping and variant-calling accuracy while achieving speed comparable to those of linear reference genome pipelines."

https://openalex.org/W2951502983,"Epigenetic modifications confer stable transcriptional patterns in the brain, and both normal and abnormal brain function involve specialized brain regions. We examined DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in neuronal and non-neuronal populations from four brain regions (anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens) as well as chromatin accessibility in the latter two. We find pronounced differences in both CpG and non-CpG methylation (CG-DMRs and CH-DMRs) only in neuronal cells across brain regions. Neuronal CH-DMRs were highly associated with differential gene expression, whereas CG-DMRs were consistent with chromatin accessibility and enriched for regulatory regions. These CG-DMRs comprise ~12 Mb of the genome that is highly enriched for genomic regions associated with heritability of neuropsychiatric traits including addictive behavior, schizophrenia, and neuroticism, thus suggesting a mechanistic link between pathology and differential neuron-specific epigenetic regulation in distinct brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2907156709,"There is accumulating evidence that the entorhinal-hippocampal network is important for temporal memory. However, relatively little is known about the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying memory for time. In particular, whether the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is involved in temporal processing remains an open question. During high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, participants watched a ~28-min episode of a television show. During the test, they viewed still-frames and indicated on a continuous timeline the precise time each still-frame was viewed during the study. This procedure allowed us to measure error in seconds for each trial. We analyzed fMRI data from retrieval and found that high temporal precision was associated with increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI activity in the anterolateral entorhinal (a homolog of the LEC in rodents) and perirhinal cortices, but not in the posteromedial entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices. This suggests a previously unknown role for the LEC in processing of high-precision, minute-scale temporal memories. In the lateral entorhinal cortex, high-precision judgments related to timing were associated with greater blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI activity than low-precision time judgments. This brain region may be involved in memory for when events occur."

We recorded electroencephalogram over and neural spiking across all layers of the supplementary eye field, an agranular cortical area, in monkeys performing a saccade-countermanding (stop signal) task. Neurons signaling error production, feedback predicting reward gain or loss, and delivery of fluid reward had different spike widths and were concentrated differently across layers. Neurons signaling error or loss of reward were more common in layers 2 and 3 (L2/3), whereas neurons signaling gain of reward were more common in layers 5 and 6 (L5/6). Variation of error- and reinforcement-related spike rates in L2/3 but not L5/6 predicted response time adaptation. Variation in error-related spike rate in L2/3 but not L5/6 predicted ERN magnitude. These findings reveal novel features of cortical microcircuitry supporting performance monitoring and confirm one cortical source of the ERN."

Morphological identification of mosquitos is currently restricted due to the small number of adequately trained professionals. We implemented a computational model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from mosquito images to identify adult mosquitoes from the species Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. To train the CNN to perform automatic morphological classification of mosquitoes, we used a dataset that included 4,056 mosquito images. Three neural networks, including LeNet, AlexNet and GoogleNet, were used. During the validation phase, the accuracy of the mosquito classification was 57.5% using LeNet, 74.7% using AlexNet and 83.9% using GoogleNet. During the testing phase, the best result (76.2%) was obtained using GoogleNet; results of 52.4% and 51.2% were obtained using LeNet and AlexNet, respectively. Significantly, accuracies of 100% and 90% were achieved for the classification of Aedes and Culex, respectively. A classification accuracy of 82% was achieved for Aedes females. Our results provide information that is fundamental for the automatic morphological classification of adult mosquito species in field. The use of CNN's is an important method for autonomous identification and is a valuable and accessible resource for health workers and taxonomists for the identification of some insects that can transmit infectious agents to humans."

We estimated the contribution of environmental risk factors (socioeconomic status (SES), air pollution and climate) in each phenotype. Mean heritability (h2 = 0.311) and shared environmental variance (c2 = 0.088) were higher than variance attributed to specific environmental factors such as zip-code-level SES (varSES = 0.002), daily air quality (varAQI = 0.0004), and average temperature (vartemp = 0.001) overall, as well as for individual phenotypes. We found significant heritability and shared environment for a number of comorbidities (h2 = 0.433, c2 = 0.241) and average monthly cost (h2 = 0.290, c2 = 0.302). All results are available using our Claims Analysis of Twin Correlation and Heritability (CaTCH) web application."
https://openalex.org/W2907106343,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are transient, highly reactive intermediates or byproducts produced during oxygen metabolism. However, when innate mechanisms are unable to cope with sequestration of surplus ROS, oxidative stress results, in which excess ROS damage biomolecules. Oxidized phosphatidylserine (PS), a proapoptotic ‘eat me’ signal, is produced in response to elevated ROS, yet little is known regarding its chemical composition and metabolism. Here, we report a small molecule that generates ROS in different mammalian cells. We used this molecule to detect, characterize and study oxidized PS in mammalian cells. We developed a chemical–genetic screen to identify enzymes that regulate oxidized PS in mammalian cells and found that the lipase ABHD12 hydrolyzes oxidized PS. We validated these findings in different physiological settings including primary peritoneal macrophages and brains from Abhd12–/– mice under inflammatory stress, and in the process, we functionally annotated an enzyme regulating oxidized PS in vivo. Screening with a small-molecule reactive-oxygen-species generator identifies the serine hydrolase enzyme ABHD12 as a lipase for the proapoptotic oxidized phoshatidylserine (ox-PS) lipids, which trigger production of proinflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2908216418,"The identification of activating mutations in NOTCH1 in 50% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has generated interest in elucidating how these mutations contribute to oncogenic transformation and in targeting the pathway. A phenotypic screen identified compounds that interfere with trafficking of Notch and induce apoptosis via an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mechanism. Target identification approaches revealed a role for SLC39A7 (ZIP7), a zinc transport family member, in governing Notch trafficking and signaling. Generation and sequencing of a compound-resistant cell line identified a V430E mutation in ZIP7 that confers transferable resistance to the compound NVS-ZP7-4. NVS-ZP7-4 altered zinc in the ER, and an analog of the compound photoaffinity labeled ZIP7 in cells, suggesting a direct interaction between the compound and ZIP7. NVS-ZP7-4 is the first reported chemical tool to probe the impact of modulating ER zinc levels and investigate ZIP7 as a novel druggable node in the Notch pathway."

Clinical S. aureus isolates have the biosynthetic capability to express either CP5 or CP8 and an understanding of the relationship between CP genotype/phenotype and S. aureus epidemiology is valuable. Using whole genome sequencing, the clonal relatedness and CP genotype were evaluated for disease-associated S. aureus isolates selected from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T) to represent different geographic regions in the United States (US) during 2004 and 2009–10. Thirteen prominent clonal complexes (CC) were identified, with CC5, 8, 30 and 45 representing >80% of disease isolates. CC5 and CC8 isolates were CP type 5 and, CC30 and CC45 isolates were CP type 8. Representative isolates from prevalent CC were susceptible to in vitro opsonophagocytic killing elicited by anti-CP antibodies, demonstrating that susceptibility to opsonic killing is not linked to the genetic lineage. However, as not all S. aureus isolates may express CP, isolates representing the diversity of disease isolates were assessed for CP production. While approximately 35% of isolates (primarily CC8) did not express CP in vitro, CP expression could be clearly demonstrated in vivo for 77% of a subset of these isolates (n = 20) despite the presence of mutations within the capsule operon. CP expression in vivo was also confirmed indirectly by measuring an increase in CP specific antibodies in mice infected with CP5 or CP8 isolates. Detection of antigen expression in vivo in relevant disease states is important to support the inclusion of these antigens in vaccines. Our findings confirm the validity of CP as vaccine targets and the potential of CP-based vaccines to contribute to S. aureus disease prevention."

Reliable information that accurately describes and characterizes the global occurrence and transmission of human viruses is essential to support national and global priority setting, public health actions, and treatment decisions. However, large areas of the globe are currently without surveillance due to limited health care infrastructure and lack of international cooperation. We propose a novel surveillance strategy, using metagenomic analysis of toilet material from international air flights as a method for worldwide viral disease surveillance. The aim of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate a method for viral analysis of airplane toilet waste enabling simultaneous detection and quantification of a wide range of human viral pathogens. Toilet waste from 19 international airplanes was analyzed for viral content, using viral capture probes followed by high-throughput sequencing. Numerous human pathogens were detected including enteric and respiratory viruses. Several geographic trends were observed with samples originating from South Asia having significantly higher viral species richness as well as higher abundances of salivirus A, aichivirus A and enterovirus B, compared to samples originating from North Asia and North America. In addition, certain city specific trends were observed, including high numbers of rotaviruses in airplanes departing from Islamabad. Based on this study we believe that central sampling and analysis at international airports could be a useful supplement for global viral surveillance, valuable for outbreak detection and for guiding public health resources."
https://openalex.org/W4238398857,"Mutations in Tp53 compromise therapeutic response, due either to the dominant-negative effect over the functional wild-type allele; or as a result of the survival advantage conferred by mutant p53 to which cancer cells become addicted. Thus, targeting mutant p53 represents an effective therapeutic strategy to treat over half of all cancers. We have therefore generated a series of small-interfering-RNAs, capable of targeting four p53 hot-spot mutants which represent ~20% of all p53 mutations. These mutant–p53-specific siRNAs (MupSi) are highly specific in silencing the expression of the intended mutants without affecting wild-type p53. Functionally, these MupSis induce cell death by abrogating both the addiction to mutant p53 and the dominant-negative effect; and retard tumor growth in xenografts when administered in a therapeutic setting. These data together demonstrate the possibility of targeting mutant p53 specifically to improve clinical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2910112205,"Multiple myeloma (MM) patients have increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism, but the underlying mechanisms and the effect on the coagulation system of the disease and the current cancer therapies are not known. It is possible that cancer-associated extracellular vesicles (EV), carrying tissue factor (TF) and procoagulant phospholipids (PPL) may play a role in thrombogenesis. The aim of this study was to perform an in-depth analysis of procoagulant activity of small and large EVs isolated from 20 MM patients at diagnosis and after receiving first-line treatment compared with 20 healthy control subjects. Differential ultracentrifugation at 20,000 × g and 100,000 × g were used to isolate EVs for quantitative and phenotypical analysis through nanoparticle tracking analysis, Western blotting and transmission electron microscopy. The isolated EVs were analyzed for procoagulant activity using the calibrated automated thrombogram technique, a factor Xa-based activity assay, and the STA Procoag-PPL assay. In general, MM patients contained more EVs, and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the presence of CD9- and CD38-positive EVs. EVs in the 20,000 × g pellets from MM patients exerted procoagulant activity visualized by increased thrombin generation and both TF and PPL activity. This effect diminished during treatment, with the most prominent effect observed in the high-dose chemotherapy eligible patients after induction therapy with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone. In conclusion, the EVs in patients with MM carrying TF and PPL are thus capable of exerting procoagulant activity."
https://openalex.org/W2906700695,"Gentamicin B (GB), a valuable starting material for the preparation of the semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic isepamicin, is produced in trace amounts by the wild-type Micromonospora echinospora. Though the biosynthetic pathway to GB has remained obscure for decades, we have now identified three hidden pathways to GB production via seven hitherto unknown intermediates in M. echinospora. The narrow substrate specificity of a key glycosyltransferase and the C6'-amination enzymes, in combination with the weak and unsynchronized gene expression of the 2'-deamination enzymes, limits GB production in M. echinospora. The crystal structure of the aminotransferase involved in C6'-amination explains its substrate specificity. Some of the new intermediates displayed similar premature termination codon readthrough activity but with reduced toxicity compared to the natural aminoglycoside G418. This work not only led to the discovery of unknown biosynthetic routes to GB, but also demonstrated the potential to mine new aminoglycosides from nature for drug discovery."

We applied modern spatial conservation theory and models to evaluate several candidate critical habitat networks, and sought an efficient conservation solution that encompassed the highest value lands for spotted owl recovery rather than maximizing the total area of potential critical habitat. We created a map of relative habitat suitability, which served as input to the spatial conservation prioritization program Zonation. We used the spatially-explicit individual-based population model HexSim to estimate and compare simulated spotted owl population outcomes among a suite of candidate critical habitat networks that varied in size and spatial arrangement under alternative scenarios of future habitat suitability and barred owl (S. varia) effects. We evaluated simulated spotted owl population outcomes, including total population size, and extinction and quasi-extinction likelihoods for 108 combinations of candidate critical habitat networks by habitat change by barred owl scenarios, both range-wide and within 11 distinct portions of the owl's range. Barred owl encounter rates and the amount and suitability of habitat had substantial effects on simulated spotted owl populations. When barred owl encounter rates were high, changes in the amount and suitability of habitat had minimal impacts on population performance. Under lowered barred owl encounter rates, candidate critical habitat networks that included most existing high suitability habitat supported a high likelihood of long-term population persistence. Barred owls are currently the primary driving force behind poor population performance of NSOs; however, our models demonstrated that a sufficient area of high suitability habitat remains essential for recovery when effects of barred owls can be reduced. The modeling approach we employed is sufficiently flexible to incorporate new information about spotted owls as it becomes available and could likely be applied to conservation planning for other species."
https://openalex.org/W2908876220,"Angiogenesis is important for the progression of cutaneous melanoma. Here, we analyzed the prognostic impact of the angiogenic factor urokinase plasminogen activator resecptor (uPAR), vascular proliferation index (VPI) and tumor necrosis as a measure of hypoxia in a patient series of nodular melanomas (n = 255) and matched loco-regional metastases (n = 78). Expression of uPAR was determined by immunohistochemistry and VPI was assessed by dual immunohistochemistry using Factor-VIII/Ki67 staining. Necrosis was recorded based on HE-slides. As novel findings, high uPAR expression and high VPI were associated with each other, and with increased tumor thickness, presence of tumor necrosis, tumor ulceration, increased mitotic count and reduced cancer specific survival in primary melanoma. In matched cases, VPI was decreased in metastases, whereas the frequency of necrosis was increased. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the impact on melanoma specific survival of uPAR expression and VPI in primary tumors, and of increased necrosis as an indicator of tumor hypoxia in loco-regional metastases. These findings support the importance of tumor angiogenesis in melanoma aggressiveness, and suggest uPAR as an indicator of vascular proliferation and a potential biomarker in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2909745848,"Basal subtype cancers are deadly malignancies but the molecular events driving tumor lethality are not completely understood. Ataxia-telangiectasia group D complementing gene (ATDC, also known as TRIM29), is highly expressed and drives tumor formation and invasion in human bladder cancers but the factor(s) regulating its expression in bladder cancer are unknown. Molecular subtyping of bladder cancer has identified an aggressive basal subtype, which shares molecular features of basal/squamous tumors arising in other organs and is defined by activation of a TP63-driven gene program. Here, we demonstrate that ATDC is linked with expression of TP63 and highly expressed in basal bladder cancers. We find that TP63 binds to transcriptional regulatory regions of ATDC and KRT14 directly, increasing their expression, and that ATDC and KRT14 execute a TP63-driven invasive program. In vivo, ATDC is required for TP63-induced bladder tumor invasion and metastasis. These results link TP63 and the basal gene expression program to ATDC and to aggressive tumor behavior. Defining ATDC as a molecular determinant of aggressive, basal cancers may lead to improved biomarkers and therapeutic approaches."

Lycoteuthis lorigera was the next most important, followed by Ancistrocheirus lesueurii. Multivariate statistics identified significant differences in diet among the four stranding locations. Long-finned pilot whales foraging off Southern Australia appear to be targeting a diverse assemblage of prey (≥10 species dominated by cephalopods). This is compared to other similar studies from New Zealand and some locations in the Northern Hemisphere, where the diet has been reported to be primarily restricted to ≤3 species dominated by cephalopods. This study emphasises the importance of cephalopods as primary prey for Southern long-finned pilot whales and other marine vertebrates, and has increased our understanding of long-finned pilot whale diet in Southern Ocean waters."
https://openalex.org/W2910601087,"Background/Purpose We analyzed the capacity of urinary Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) to quantify the degree of mucosal injury in neonates with gastroschisis (GS) and to predict the speed of their clinical recovery after surgery. Methods In this prospective study, we collected urine during the first 48h after surgery from neonates operated between 2012 and 2015 for GS. Neonates with surgery that did not include gut mucosa served as controls for simple GS and neonates with surgery for intestinal atresia served as control for complex GS patients. The I-FABP levels were analyzed by ELISA. Results Urinary I-FABP after the surgery is significantly higher in GS newborns than in control group; I-FABP in complex GS is higher than in simple GS. I-FABP can predict subsequent operation for ileus in patients with complex GS. Both ways of abdominal wall closure (i.e. primary closure and stepwise reconstruction) led to similar levels of I-FABP. None of the static I-FABP values was useful for the outcome prediction. The steep decrease in I-FABP after the surgery is associated with faster recovery, but it cannot predict early start of minimal enteral feeding, full enteral feeding or length of hospitalization. Conclusion Urinary I-FABP reflects the mucosal damage in gastroschisis but it has only a limited predictive value for patients’ outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2910223575,"The type III TGF-β receptor (TβRIII) is a TGF-β co-receptor that presents ligand to the type II TGF-β receptor to initiate signaling. TβRIII also undergoes ectodomain shedding to release a soluble form (sTβRIII) that can bind ligand, sequestering it away from cell surface receptors. We have previously identified a TβRIII extracellular mutant that has enhanced ectodomain shedding (“super shedding (SS)”—TβRIII-SS). Here, we utilize TβRIII-SS to study the balance of cell surface and soluble TβRIII in the context of lung cancer. We demonstrate that expressing TβRIII-SS in lung cancer cell models induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and that these TβRIII-SS (EMT) cells are less migratory, invasive and adhesive and more resistant to gemcitabine. Moreover, TβRIII-SS (EMT) cells exhibit decreased tumorigenicity but increased growth rate in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest that the balance of cell surface and soluble TβRIII may regulate a dichotomous role for TβRIII during cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2908613645,"Through the application of a region-focused saturation mutagenesis and randomization approach, protein engineering of the Cal-A enzyme was undertaken with the goal of conferring new triglyceride selectivity. Little is known about the mode of triglyceride binding to Cal-A. Engineering Cal-A thus requires a systemic approach. Targeted and randomized Cal-A libraries were created, recombined using the Golden Gate approach and screened to detect variants able to discriminate between long-chain (olive oil) and short-chain (tributyrin) triglyceride substrates using a high-throughput in vivo method to visualize hydrolytic activity. Discriminative variants were analyzed using an in-house script to identify predominant substitutions. This approach allowed identification of variants that exhibit strong discrimination for the hydrolysis of short-chain triglycerides and others that discriminate towards hydrolysis of long-chain triglycerides. A clear pattern emerged from the discriminative variants, identifying the 217–245 helix-loop-helix motif as being a hot-spot for triglyceride recognition. This was the consequence of introducing the entire mutational load in selected regions, without putting a strain on distal parts of the protein. Our results improve our understanding of the Cal-A lipase mode of action and selectivity. This holistic perspective to protein engineering, where parts of the gene are individually mutated and the impact evaluated in the context of the whole protein, can be applied to any protein scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W2910312311,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal motor neuron disease with no cure. Currently there are only two ALS drugs approved by the FDA, both with a limited therapeutic effect. In the search for drug candidates for ALS, we studied the effect of known stem cell mobilizing agents (treatment) and antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (anti-treatment) in SOD1G93A model of ALS. Surprisingly, we found that anti-cancer drug 5-FU increases lifespan, delays the disease onset and improves motor performance in ALS mice. Although we were not able to demonstrate the mechanistic basis of the beneficial 5-FU action in ALS mice, our findings suggest that 5-FU or similar drugs are possible drug candidates for the treatment of motor neuron diseases through drug repurposing."

Many measures have been defined on the literature, and among them, a measure inspired by Shannon’s entropy named the Confusion Entropy (CEN). In this work we introduce a new measure, MCEN, by modifying CEN to avoid its unwanted behaviour in the binary case, that disables it as a suitable performance measure in classification. We compare MCEN with CEN and other performance measures, presenting analytical results in some particularly interesting cases, as well as some heuristic computational experimentation."
https://openalex.org/W2910382351,"Is it possible to compare the physicochemical properties of a wild-type protein and its mutant form under the same conditions? Provided the mutation has destabilized the protein, it may be more correct to compare the mutant protein under native conditions to the wild-type protein destabilized with a small amount of the denaturant. In general, is it appropriate to compare the properties of proteins destabilized by different treatments: mutations, pH, temperature, and denaturants like urea? These issues have compelled us to search for methods and ways of presentation of experimental results that would allow a comparison of mutant forms of proteins under different conditions and lead to conclusions on the effect of mutations on the protein folding/unfolding pathway. We have studied equilibrium unfolding of wild-type bovine carbonic anhydrase II (BCA II) and its six mutant forms using different urea concentrations. BCA II has been already studied in detail and is a good model object for validating new techniques. In this case, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy was chosen as the basic research method. The main features of this experimental method allowed us to compare different stages of unfolding of studied proteins and prove experimentally that a single substitution of the amino acid in three mutant forms of BCA II affected the native state of the protein but did not change its unfolding pathway. On the contrary, the inserted disulfide bridge in three other mutant forms of BCA II affected the protein unfolding pathway. An important result of this research is that we have validated the new approach allowing investigation of the effect of mutations on the folding of globular proteins, because in this way it is possible to compare proteins in the same structural states rather than under identical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2910661227,"Background Use of psychotropic drugs is common among older adults. Population-based studies on the associations of psychotropic drug use with mortality are sparse. Objectives To investigate the associations between the use of specific psychotropic drug groups (opioids, antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines) and all-cause mortality among community-dwelling older adults in Germany. Methods Participants of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 were followed up for mortality from 1997 to 2011. Persons aged 60–79 years with complete data on psychotropic drug use at baseline and on mortality follow-up were considered as study population (N = 1,563). Associations between the use of opioids, antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines and all-cause mortality were examined by Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for sociodemographics (sex, age, community size, region, socioeconomic status), life style (smoking, sports, risky alcohol drinking) and health conditions (obesity, disability, history of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, any cancers, any mental disorders) at baseline. Results After a median follow-up of 11.4 years, 21, 18, 23 and 26 deaths were documented among those who used at baseline opioids (n = 39), antipsychotics (n = 30), antidepressants (n = 53) and benzodiazepines (n = 54) with an unadjusted mortality rate (MR) of 57.7, 59.1, 44.6 and 53.7 per 1000 person-years, respectively. Meanwhile, 400 deaths were documented among 1,406 nonusers of any of the above mentioned psychotropic drugs with a MR of 26.7 per 1000 person-years. The age and sex adjusted mortality rate ratios in comparison with nonusers were 2.20 (95% confidence intervals 1.42–3.41), 1.66(1.03–2.70), 1.56(1.06–2.28), and 1.57(1.07–2.31) for the use of opioids, antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines, respectively. In the fully adjusted Cox models, use of opioids (hazardous ratio 2.04, 95% confidence intervals 1.07–3.89), antipsychotics (2.15, 1.11–4.15) and benzodiazepines (1.76, 1.09–2.82), but not antidepressants, were significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality. Conclusions Use of opioids, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines is significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality among community-dwelling older adults in Germany. Clinicians should be careful in prescribing these psychotropic drugs to older adults while patients already under psychotropic therapy should well balance the risks and benefits of drug use. Further studies with a larger sample size and information on specific indications for psychotropic drug use and mental comorbidities are required to confirm the findings of the present study."
https://openalex.org/W2909131457,"Objective Lupus nephritis (LN) frequently progresses to end-stage renal disease. Finding a biomarker for LN and a predictor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is important for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods Ninety patients with SLE were divided into biopsy-proven LN (n = 54) and no kidney involvement (non-LN) (n = 36) groups and followed up for 54 months. Results Of 36 patients with LN, 3 (5.6%) had class II disease, 3 (5.6%) had class III, 35 (64.8%) had class IV, 10 (18.5%) had class V, and 3 (5.6%) had class VI (advanced sclerosis). Compared to the non-LN group, patients in the LN group had higher autoimmunity evidenced by a higher proportion of low C3 and C4 levels, positive anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR). Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) levels were significantly higher in the LN group (LN vs non-LN, 670 vs 33 ng/mL, respectively). The patients with LN had a higher urinary polyomavirus BK (BKV) load (3.6 vs 3.0 log copies/mL) and a lower urinary BKV miRNA (miR-B1) 5p level (0.29 vs 0.55 log copies/mL, p = 0.025), while there was no significant difference in the level of miR-B1-3p. Urinary miR-B1-5p level but not urinary BKV load was negatively correlated with uNGAL level (r = -0.22, p = 0.004). At the cutoff value of 80 ng/mL, the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that uNGAL level as a predictor of the presence of LN had a high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (100%) (area under the curve [AUC], 0.997; p < 0.001). During the 54-month follow-up period, 14 (7%) patients with LN and none of the non-LN patients developed CKD. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that baseline uNGAL level was the only predictive factor for CKD development, while baseline serum creatinine level and eGFR were not. Conclusion An elevated urinary BKV viral load with a decreased level of miR-B1 implies the presence of LN. In addition, an increased uNGAL level is a good biomarker not only in predicting the presence of LN but also for prediction of CKD development in patients with SLE."
https://openalex.org/W2910369691,"Retinoblastoma is a childhood retinal tumor that develops from cone photoreceptor precursors in response to inactivating RB1 mutations and loss of functional RB protein. The cone precursor's response to RB loss involves cell type-specific signaling circuitry that helps to drive tumorigenesis. One component of the cone precursor circuitry, the thyroid hormone receptor β2 (TRβ2), enables the aberrant proliferation of diverse RB-deficient cells in part by opposing the down-regulation of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) by the more widely expressed and tumor-suppressive TRβ1. However, it is unclear how TRβ2 opposes TRβ1 to enable SKP2 expression and cell proliferation. Here, we show that in human retinoblastoma cells TRβ2 mRNA encodes two TRβ2 protein isoforms: a predominantly cytoplasmic 54-kDa protein (TRβ2-54) corresponding to the well-characterized full-length murine Trβ2 and an N-terminally truncated and exclusively cytoplasmic 46-kDa protein (TRβ2-46) that starts at Met-79. Whereas TRβ2 knockdown decreased SKP2 expression and impaired retinoblastoma cell cycle progression, re-expression of TRβ2-46 but not TRβ2-54 stabilized SKP2 and restored proliferation to an extent similar to that of ectopic SKP2 restoration. We conclude that TRβ2-46 is an oncogenic thyroid hormone receptor isoform that promotes SKP2 expression and SKP2-dependent retinoblastoma cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2909146040,"To explore migrant physicians' conceptions about working in rural and remote areas in Sweden to understand what influences their motivation to work in these areas.The study employed a qualitative approach with semi-structured interviews with 24 migrant physicians. Transcripts were thematically analysed.Conceptions were identified about foremost work content and tasks, and about living in rural and remote areas. Work content and tasks related to the health care systems, type of health care facility, duties, specialty, resources, patient population, colleagues, and professional development. Conceptions about living concerned geographical characteristics, people living in rural and remote areas, opportunities for travelling, family, leisure activities, social life, and language skills. Conceptions seemed to be influenced by individual, professional and societal aspects from both previous countries and Sweden. Conceptions and biographical aspects both appeared to affect motivation.Motivation regarding working in rural and remote areas appeared to be influenced by conceptions of these areas. A specific type of place could be understood as being able to provide (or not) the external conditions needed for fulfilling needs and reaching goals, whether professional or personal, and as a tool for reaching or facilitating the achievement of these. Conceptions of an area can hence affect motivation and choices for where to work and live. However, biographical aspects also impact motivation. Our results indicate that positive rural experience in the recipient country might be a predictor for motivation.Professional and personal life and are intertwined. Conceptions about an area influence willingness to work there. Willingness is also affected by, and intertwined with, other aspects such as previous experiences, age, marital status and family circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W2908543791,"The study of drug toxicity in human organs is complicated by their complex inter-relations and by the obvious difficulty to testing drug effects on biologically relevant material. Animal models and human cell cultures offer alternatives for systematic and large-scale profiling of drug effects on gene expression level, as typically found in the so-called toxicogenomics datasets. However, the complexity of these data, which includes variable drug doses, time points, and experimental setups, makes it difficult to choose and integrate the data, and to evaluate the appropriateness of one or another model system to study drug toxicity (of particular drugs) of particular human organs. Here, we define a protocol to integrate drug-wise rankings of gene expression changes in toxicogenomics data, which we apply to the TG-GATEs dataset, to prioritize genes for association to drug toxicity in liver or kidney. Contrast of the results with sets of known human genes associated to drug toxicity in the literature allows to compare different rank aggregation approaches for the task at hand. Collectively, ranks from multiple models point to genes not previously associated to toxicity, notably, the PCNA clamp associated factor (PCLAF), and genes regulated by the master regulator of the antioxidant response NFE2L2, such as NQO1 and SRXN1. In addition, comparing gene ranks from different models allowed us to evaluate striking differences in terms of toxicity-associated genes between human and rat hepatocytes or between rat liver and rat hepatocytes. We interpret these results to point to the different molecular functions associated to organ toxicity that are best described by each model. We conclude that the expected production of toxicogenomics panels with larger numbers of drugs and models, in combination with the ongoing increase of the experimental literature in organ toxicity, will lead to increasingly better associations of genes for organism toxicity."
