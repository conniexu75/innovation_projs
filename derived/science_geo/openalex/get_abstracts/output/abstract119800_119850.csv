https://openalex.org/W1975386197,"The process of agonist-promoted internalization (sequestration) of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is intimately linked to the regulation of GPCR responsiveness. Following agonist-mediated desensitization, sequestration of GPCR is presumably associated with the dephosphorylation and recycling of functional receptors. However, the exact mechanisms responsible for GPCR sequestration, even for the prototypic β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), have remained controversial. We demonstrate here that dynamin, a GTPase that regulates the formation and internalization of clathrin-coated vesicles, is essential for the agonist-promoted sequestration of the β2AR, suggesting that the β2AR internalizes via the clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytic pathway. In contrast, internalization of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR), another typical GPCR, does not require dynamin. In addition, the AT1AR internalizes independent of the function of β-arrestin, a critical component for β2AR cellular trafficking, but additional AT1ARs are mobilized to the dynamin-dependent pathway upon overexpression of β-arrestin. These findings demonstrate that GPCRs can utilize distinct endocytic pathways, distinguishable by dynamin and β-arrestin, and that β-arrestins function as adaptor proteins specifically targeting GPCRs for dynamin-dependent endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W1984745753,"Mammalian sphingomyelinases have been implicated in many important physiological and pathophysiological processes. Although several mammalian sphingomyelinases have been identified and studied, one of these, an acidic Zn<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated sphingomyelinase (Zn-SMase) originally found in fetal bovine serum, has received little attention since its first and only report 7 years ago. We now show that Zn-SMase activity is secreted by human and murine macrophages, human skin fibroblasts, microglial cells, and several other cells in culture and is markedly up-regulated during differentiation of human monocytes to macrophages. Remarkably, peritoneal macrophages from mice in which the acid SMase gene had been disrupted by homologous recombination secreted no Zn-SMase activity, indicating that this enzyme and the intracellular lysosomal SMase, which is Zn-independent, arise from the same gene. Furthermore, skin fibroblasts from patients with types A and B Niemann-Pick disease, which are known to lack lysosomal SMase activity, also lack Zn-SMase activity in their conditioned media. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with a cDNA encoding lysosomal SMase massively overexpress both cellular lysosomal SMase and secreted Zn-SMase activities. Thus, Zn-SMase arises independently of alternative splicing, suggesting a post-translational process. In summary, a wide variety of cell types secrete Zn-SMase activity, which arises from the same gene as lysosomal SMase. This secreted enzyme may play roles in physiological and pathophysiological processes involving extracellular sphingomyelin hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2019630846,"Progression of eukaryotic cells through the cell cycle is governed by the sequential formation, activation, and subsequent inactivation of a series of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes. p27Kip1 (p27) is a Cdk inhibitor that blocks, in vitro, the activity of cyclin D-Cdk4, cyclin D-Cdk6, cyclin E-Cdk2 as well as cyclin A-Cdk2, a complex active during S phase. The level of p27 protein expression, usually high in G0/G1 resting cells, declines as cells progress toward S phase and enforced expression of p27 in fibroblasts causes G1 arrest. This situation prevails in CCL39, a Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line (this report). However, in addition to p27, several other Cdk inhibitors known to alter G1 progression coexist in most mammalian cells. To investigate the specific contribution of p27 in the control of the mitogen-sensitive G0/G1 arrest, we specifically reduced its synthesis by expressing a full-length p27 antisense cDNA in CCL39 cells. Interestingly, reduction of up to 90% of p27 protein expression increased both basal and serum-stimulated gene transcription of cyclin D1, cyclin A, dihydrofolate reductase, and DNA synthesis reinitiation. Moreover, overexpression of this antisense allows cells to grow for several generations in a serum-free medium supplemented with insulin and transferrin only, thus suggesting that p27-depleted cells cannot exit the cell cycle. These effects were fully reversed by coexpression of a plasmid encoding p27 sense. We conclude that p27, by setting the level of growth factor requirement, plays a pivotal role in controlling cell cycle exit, a fundamental step in growth control.

https://openalex.org/W2073866295,"Fatty acid elongation defective mutants were isolated from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> by mutagenizing strains that were defective in fatty acid synthase (<i>FAS</i>) activity. Cells of the fatty acid synthase-defective strains can grow when supplemented with tetradecanoic acid (14:0) due to the presence of membrane bound elongation systems that can extend the 14 carbon fatty acid to longer chain species. After mutagenesis and rescue on medium containing a mixture of 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0, cells were screened for their inability to grow on medium containing only 14:0. From 150,000 colonies, four stable isolates were identified, all of which appear to represent the same complementation group. Gas chromatography of lipid extracts from mutant <i>elo1-1</i> (designated as elongation defective) cells grown with long or medium chain fatty acids indicates that it fails to efficiently elongate (12, 13, or 14) carbon fatty acids. A gene disrupted <i>fas2Δ::LEU2;elo1Δ::HIS3</i> mutant incorporates 14-18-carbon fatty acids into membrane lipids, indicating that fatty acid transport is not affected by the mutation. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the <i>ELO1</i> gene suggests that the encoded protein is a membrane bound polypeptide that contains at least five potential membrane spanning regions and a presumptive NADPH binding site. Analysis of the <i>ELO1</i> mRNA levels indicates that the gene is expressed in cells grown on fatty acid deficient medium. It is rapidly induced in wild type cells that are supplemented with 14:0 and is repressed when cells are supplied with 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids."

Among mammalian tissues, renal medullary cells are uniquely exposed to extreme hyperosmotic stress. Sorbitol, synthesized through aldose reductase, is a predominant osmolyte induced under hyperosmotic conditions in renal cells. Using a rabbit renal cell line, we originally demonstrated that hyperosmotic stress induces transcription of the aldose reductase gene. Recently, we cloned the rabbit aldose reductase gene, characterized its structure, and found the first evidence of an osmotic response region in a eukaryotic gene. Now, we have progressively subdivided this 3221-base pair (bp) region into discrete fragments in reporter gene constructs. Thereby, we have functionally defined the smallest sequence able to confer hyperosmotic response on a downstream gene independent of other putative cis-elements, that is, a minimal essential osmotic response element (ORE). The sequence of the ORE is CGGAAAATCAC(C) (bp −1105/−1094). A 17-bp fragment (−1108/−1092) containing the ORE used as a probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggests hyperosmotic induction of a slowly migrating band. Isolation of trans-acting factor(s) and characterization of their interaction with the ORE should elucidate the basic mechanisms for regulation of gene expression by hyperosmotic stress.

https://openalex.org/W2064983363,"Phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) isozymes are thought to be activated by receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Proteins that activate PLC-γ1 have now been purified from bovine brain and identified as members of the tau family of microtubule-associated proteins. Activation of PLC-γ by tau was enhanced in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid, saturated fatty acids being ineffective. Maximal (15-20-fold) activation was apparent in the presence of 0.15 µM tau and 25 µM arachidonic acid (AA). The effect of tau and AA was specific to PLC-γ isozymes in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and was markedly inhibited by phosphatidylcholine. These results suggest that in cells that express tau, receptors coupled to cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> may activate PLC-γ isozymes indirectly in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation through the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate AA."
https://openalex.org/W2011414653,"A homolog of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) hsp70 protein, binding protein (BiP), from the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei (Bangs, J. D., Uyetake, L., Brickman, M. J., Balber, A. E., and Boothroyd, J. C. (1993) J. Cell Sci. 105, 1101-1113) is further characterized. In co-precipitation experiments, BiP transiently associates with newly synthesized secretory proteins, including variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), confirming its role as a molecular chaperone. To study the molecular signals targeting BiP to the ER, we have developed soluble secretory reporters for expression in transformed procyclic trypanosomes. Deletion of the BiP C-terminal tetrapeptide (MDDL) and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor addition sequence of VSG converts these proteins to secreted forms. Attachment of MDDL to VSG results in intracellular retention confirming that MDDL is a trypanosomal ER localization signal. Secretion of both reporters is inefficient, but further truncation of the BiP C-terminal peptide-binding domain allows quantitative export (t1/2 ~1 h) of the N-terminal ATPase domain (BiPN), consistent with the conserved domain structure of hsp70 proteins. This is the first demonstration of soluble protein secretion in African trypanosomes. Using the BiPN reporter, the sequence specificity of C-terminal tetrapeptide retention signals in trypanosomes is analyzed and found to be similar to higher eukaryotes. These results indicate that the basic signals mediating protein targeting to the ER lumen are conserved throughout the wide range of eukaryotic evolution.

These results indicate that the basic signals mediating protein targeting to the ER lumen are conserved throughout the wide range of eukaryotic evolution. African trypanosomes, parasitic protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida, represent one of the most ancient of all eukaryotic lineages (1Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonoso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). They have a life cycle that alternates between an insect vector, tse-tse flies, and mammalian hosts, in which they cause serious disease. Considerable effort has been made in the study of trypanosome molecular biology resulting in the elucidation of many unusual molecular and biochemical pathways, such as trans-splicing and RNA editing. More recently, interest in the basic cell biology of these organisms has grown, and significant progress has been made in areas such as organellar biogenesis (2Clayton C. Hausler T. Blattner J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 325-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and endocytosis (3Balber A.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 177-201PubMed Google Scholar). One area, however, that has lagged behind is that of secretion and secretory protein trafficking. Most of what is known about secretory trafficking in trypanosomes comes from biosynthetic studies of VSG, 1The abbreviations used are: VSGvariant surface glycoproteinGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolERendoplasmic reticulumBiPbinding proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salinepBSIISKBluescript II SK-,PARP, procyclic acidic repetitive proteinCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseNeoneomycin phosphotransferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionGUSβ-glucaronidasehsp70heat shock protein 70 kDa, bp base pair(s). a homodimeric GPI-anchored protein that is the major surface antigen of the bloodstream stage (4Bangs J.D.

Hyg. 1988; 82: 577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), has all been reported. Unfortunately, none of these have been characterized at the molecular level. All exocytic and endocytic trafficking in trypanosomes occurs at an invaginated plasma membrane microdomain called the flagellar pocket (3Balber A.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 177-201PubMed Google Scholar, 12Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since the opening of the lumen of the pocket to the external environment is restricted, it may be that exit of soluble molecules is not possible. However, fluid phase markers can enter the pocket (13Langreth S.G. Balber A.E. J. Protozool. 1975; 22: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and secretion of soluble polypeptides does occur in the related trypanosomatids, Trypanosoma cruzi (14Andrews N.W. Whitlow M.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Leishmania donovani (15Bates P. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem.

Thus, the absence of soluble secretion in T. brucei most likely reflects the failure to detect such molecules rather than the true biological situation. variant surface glycoprotein glycosylphosphatidylinositol endoplasmic reticulum binding protein phosphate-buffered saline Bluescript II SK-,PARP, procyclic acidic repetitive protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase neomycin phosphotransferase polymerase chain reaction β-glucaronidase heat shock protein 70 kDa, bp base pair(s). The VSG biosynthetic studies suggest that a relatively typical eukaryotic secretory pathway is operative in trypanosomes, and membranous structures morphologically resembling the ER and Golgi can be discerned by electron microscopy (13Langreth S.G. Balber A.E. J. Protozool. 1975; 22: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Vickerman K. J. Protozool. 1969; 16: 54-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, molecular markers for the secretory subcompartments are few. A trypanosomal homolog of BiP has been characterized, and this serves as an ER marker (18Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no other immunological marker proteins are available for cell biological investigations. Not surprisingly then, little is known about the molecular signals that direct the intracellular trafficking and targeting of the protein components of the trypanosomal secretory pathway. One of the best documented examples of protein targeting in eukaryotic cells is the localization of soluble proteins, such as BiP, to the lumen of the ER (reviewed in Ref. 19Pelham H.R.B. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These proteins have C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences that serve as specific ER localization signals. The consensus tetrapeptide motif is XDEL where the amino acid X varies in a species-specific, and sometimes protein-specific, manner. Typical examples are KDEL in mammals, HDEL in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DDEL in Kluyveromyces lactis, and ADEL in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (19Pelham H.R.B. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Pidoux A. Armstrong J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All of the aforementioned sequences have been tested functionally in transfection experiments. Sequences in other species such as SDEL in Plasmodium falciparum (21Kumar N. Zheng H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and KDEL in Giardia lamblia (22Gupta R.S. Aitken K. Falah M. Singh B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2895-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) are presumed by analogy to be retention signals. Two putative signals have been found in trypanosomes, MDDL and KQDL at the C termini of BiP (18Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a protein disulfide isomerase homolog (23Hsu M.P. Muhich M. Boothroyd J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6440-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), respectively. Given the relative divergence of the trypanosomal sequences and the great phylogenetic distance between trypanosomes and species where ER targeting has been assayed directly, it is essential that these sequences be demonstrated to actually mediate ER localization. The main obstacle to the study of protein trafficking in trypanosomes has been the inability to express recombinant genes in these organisms. In recent years this technological hurdle has been overcome (24Ten Asbroek A.L.M.A. Oullette M. Borst P. Nature. 1990; 348: 174-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25Lee M.G.-S.

Parasitol. 1993; 61: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and stable transformation vectors have been exploited to study both mitochondrial and glycosomal protein targeting (reviewed in Ref. 2Clayton C. Hausler T. Blattner J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 325-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we use similar techniques to investigate secretory protein trafficking in T. brucei. First, we have confirmed that trypanosomal BiP functions as a molecular chaperone by demonstrating its transient physical interaction with an endogenous secretory protein, VSG. Second, we have developed soluble secretory reporters that are efficiently exported to the extracellular environment when expressed in procyclic cells, explicitly demonstrating for the first time that soluble secretion in African trypanosomes is possible. Finally, we have exploited these recombinant reporters to study the sequence specificity of ER targeting signals. Our results demonstrate that C-terminal tetrapeptides mediate ER localization in trypanosomes and define the sequence specificity of this phenomenon. This work suggests that ER localization occurs by a mechanism that is common to most, if not all, eukaryotic organisms. Strain 427 (MITar 1 serodeme) bloodstream (clone MITat1.2 expressing VSG 221) and procyclic insect stage (Pro1 cell line derived from clone MITat1.4) trypanosomes were used for all experiments (18Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Procyclic cells were grown at 27°C in TM-P medium (27Overath P. Czichos J. Hass C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For metabolic radiolabeling, procyclic cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended at 107/ml in prewarmed (27°C) Met/Cys-minus TM-P with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Labeling was initiated by the addition of [35S]Met/Cys (Expre35S35S, DuPont NEN) to 100 µCi/ml. For pulse/chase experiments, procyclic cells were labeled at 108/ml with 200 µCi/ml, and the chase was initiated by 10-fold dilution with prewarmed complete TM-P growth medium. Bloodstream cells from infected mice (6Bangs J.D. Doering D.L. Englund P.T. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17697-17705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated (107/ml, 37°C, 5% CO2) for 1 h in HMI9 media (28Hirumi H. Hirumi K. Parasitol.

Biochem. 1986; 160: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and then radiolabeled for 5 min (108 cells/ml, 200 µCi/ml). Chase was initiated by 10-fold dilution with prewarmed complete HMI9 medium. Cells were monitored throughout the labeling period by microscopy, and viability as judged by motility was excellent. Affinity purified rabbit anti-VSG117 antibody and whole rabbit anti-BiP antiserum have been described (18Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-VSG 221 serum and affinity purified rabbit anti-HA-9 peptide antibody were generous gifts of Dr. John Boothroyd (Stanford University) and Dr. David Russell (Washington University), respectively. Rabbit anti-β-glucuronidase (GUS) was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Labeled cells (107, 1.0 ml) were centrifuged and the supernatants reserved. Cells were washed once in PBS, solubilized in 1.0 ml of wash buffer (TEN, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) (where TEN buffer is 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (18Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and precleared by centrifugation (microcentrifuge, 5 min, 14,000 rpm). Detergents were added to culture supernatants to the same final concentrations as lysis buffer. Antibody was preadsorbed to Protein A-Sepharose beads (18Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), washed once, and resuspended to the original volume in wash buffer. Typically, 50 µl of antibody:Protein A-Sepharose suspension was added to 0.5 ml of cell lysate or culture supernatant. Samples were mixed (1 h, 4°C) and then washed four times with wash buffer and once with TEN. For sequential immunoprecipitation, a primary anti-BiP immunoprecipitate was solubilized in TEN, 1% SDS (50 µl, 65°C, 10 min) and diluted with TEN, 1.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.55% deoxycholate (450 µl). Following centrifugation the supernatant was reprecipitated with anti-VSG (16 h, 4°C) and washed as above. Final precipitates were resuspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 200 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue (25 µl), fractionated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by fluorography.

Procedures were performed by protocols according to either Ref. 29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar or manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were cloned into pBSIISK (Stratagene Inc., San Diego, CA), and the ends were sequenced (Sequenase kit, United States Biochemical Corp.) to confirm identity. The stable transformation vector, pXS2, was constructed from p205CAT+A (a generous gift of Dr. John Boothroyd, Stanford University), which contains in order (5′ to 3′ in pBSIIKS) the PARP B locus promoter region (−1044 to +22 bp relative to the B2α splice acceptor site (30Sherman D.R. Lennart J. Hug M. Clayton C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3379-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) in the pBSIIKS HincII site; the CAT gene in the pBSIIKS HindIII site; and an EcoRI/BglII fragment containing the βα-tubulin intragenic region (TUBint, −108 to +532 bp relative to the β-tubulin 3′ end) (31Kimmel B.E. Samson A. Wu J. Hirschberg R. Yarbrough L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 35: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in the pBSIIKS EcoRI/BamHI sites. p205CAT+A was first modified by deletion of the CAT-bearing HindIII fragment and by elimination of three restriction sites (AscI at 896 bp upstream of the procyclin B2α splice acceptor site, EcoRI at the 5′ end of TUBint, and BstXI in the 3′ pBSIIKS polylinker) with separate rounds of cutting, filling in, and ligation. Second, the 795-bp Neo gene was PCR-amplified using kinased primers JB55/JB56 and the plasmid pRC/RSV (Invitrogen, San Diego) as template. Third, the PARP B2αβ intragenic region (PARPint, 937 bp from the B2α 3′ end to 3 bp upstream of the B2β start codon) was PCR-amplified using kinased primers JB57/JB58 and the cloned procyclin B2 locus (a generous gift of Dr. Keith Wilson, Stanford University) as template. Both PCR products were EcoRV/SmaI digested and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBSIISK generating pNeo and pPARPint. The PARPint EcoRV/SmaI fragment was then inserted into the EcoRV site of pNEO to generate a PARPint:NEO fusion (pPIN) with unique flanking 5′ EcoRV and 3′ SmaI sites. This fragment was then inserted into the EcoRV site of modified p205CAT+A to create pXS2 with a multicloning region between the B2α trans-splice acceptor site and PARPint (Fig. 1A). Epitope-tagging vectors were constructed for the introduction of the nine amino acid (YPYDVPDYA) HA9 epitope (32Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) into reporter constructs. Deoxyoligonucleotides JB52/JB53 were annealed to create a double-stranded insert encoding the HA9 epitope and having EcoRI-compatible single-stranded overhangs. This was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBSIISK in both orientations such that the 5′ end of the insert coding strand is proximal to the KpnI (pHA9F) or SacI (pHA9R) sites of the pBSIISK polylinker. The EcoRI site is preserved at the insert 3′ end only. These vectors allow the in-frame fusion of any coding region to the HA9 epitope using unique NsiI and NheI sites at the 5′ end of the insert in conjunction with any site in the pBSIISK polylinker. Reporter gene cassettes (Fig. 1B) were generated by PCR using the following cloned genes as template: pλA4 containing the T. brucei BiP gene (18Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); pGB117 containing the T. brucei VSG 117 basic copy gene (a generous gift of Dr. John Boothroyd, Stanford University); and pGUSN358-S (CLONTECH Laboratories) containing the bacterial β-glucuronidase gene. Products were cloned into either pBSIISK, pHA9F, or pHA9R, and the ends were sequenced to confirm identity. Using unique flanking restriction sites, reporter cassettes were then inserted into the pXS2 multicloning region to generate pXS2:reporter constructs. In some cases, products were cloned directly into pXS2, and the 3′ end of the inserts were sequenced using primer JB85. The coding region for GUS was amplified using primers JB36/JB37. The full-length trypanosome BiP gene was amplified in two forms, minus the C-terminal MDDL tetrapeptide sequence (JB71/JB73) and minus both the C-terminal tetrapeptide and N-terminal signal sequences (JB72/JB73). These were cloned into pHA9R using flanking XmaI/NheI sites to generate the epitope-tagged reporter genes, BiPHA9 and BiPHA9Δss. The 415-amino acid N-terminal ATPase domain of BiP was amplified (JB93/JB94) and substituted for BiP in BiPHA9 using flanking HindIII/NheI sites (BiPN). C-terminal modifications of BiPN were made by PCR. BiPNMDDL, encoding the native C-terminal BiP hexapeptide QPMDDL, was generated using BiPN as template (JB93/JB64). BiPNAVRG, encoding the C-terminal hexapeptide QPAVRG, was generated using BiPNMDDL as template (JB93/JB99). The following derivatives were made with BiPNMDDL or BiPNAVRG as template: BiPNKDEL (JB93/JB109), BiPNKQDL (JB93/JB118), BiPNMDD- (JB93/JB119), and BiPNAVDL (JB93/JB125). The VSG 117 gene was amplified minus the C-terminal GPI addition signal (117Δgpi) with primers JB77/JB79. 117MDDL was made by replacing the BiPN portion of pBiPNMDDL with the 117Δgpi cassette. Mid-log phase (~5 × 106 cells/ml) procyclic trypanosomes were washed once in PBS and resuspended at 4 × 107/ml in Optimem medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Qiagen-purified (QIAGEN Inc, Chatsworth, CA) pXS2:reporter plasmids were linearized using a unique BstXI site in the βα-tubulin intragenic region cassette, precipitated, washed in 70% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved at 1.0 mg/ml in Optimem. 0.5 ml of cells and 0.1 ml of linear DNA were mixed in 0.4-mm cuvettes and electroporated (24 Ω, 1.5 kV) in a BTX600 cell manipulator (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA). Cells were transferred to 10-ml TM-P cultures, and, at 48 h, G418 was added to 50 µg/ml. Stable cell lines typically grew out in 2-3 weeks and were maintained in 25 µg/ml G418. Previous analyses, based on sequence homology and subcellular localization, indicate that we have identified the trypanosomal homolog of the ER hsp70 protein, BiP (18Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As such, it would be predicted to act as a molecular chaperone by facilitating the folding and assembly of secretory proteins (33Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3602) Google Scholar). Therefore, prior to investigation of the molecular signals responsible for intracellular targeting of the trypanosomal BiP homolog, we wished to confirm that it has chaperone function as judged by transient physical interaction with newly synthesized secretory proteins. VSG, the major secretory protein of bloodstream trypanosomes, comprising 10-20% of total cell protein (34Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), is the ideal choice for such an assay. Bloodstream trypanosomes were pulse/chase-radiolabeled, and polypeptides were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with anti-BiP or anti-VSG (Fig. 2A). The total amount of each labeled protein (lanes 1-5, VSG; lanes 6-10, BiP) remained constant throughout the chase period. More importantly, at the earliest chase time, an abundant newly synthesized protein of the same mobility as VSG co-precipitated with anti-BiP (lane 6). This association was transient, disappearing rapidly during the chase period (lanes 7-10). Additionally, a set of high Mr proteins were also BiP-associated in a transient, although more prolonged manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 6-10). The identity of the major BiP-associated protein was investigated by sequential immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B). Following denaturation of a primary anti-BiP immunoprecipitate (lane 2), VSG could be specifically reprecipitated (lane 3) confirming that it is the major BiP-associated protein. Radiolabeled VSG is readily detected in anti-BiP precipitates since a significant portion of newly synthesized VSG is associated with the total BiP pool (compare lanes 1 and 2). However, the converse is not true (lane 1), since BiP is synthesized at a much lower rate and little of the radiolabeled pool is likely to be associated with VSG. These results indicate that BiP does interact physically with VSG, consistent with its role as a secretory molecular chaperone, and validate its use as a reporter for ER localization studies. A vector for the stable transformation of cultured procyclic trypanosomes (pXS2, Fig. 1A) was constructed based on the previous work of others (24Ten Asbroek A.L.M.A. Oullette M. Borst P. Nature. 1990; 348: 174-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25Lee M.G.-S. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1583-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Hug M. Carruthers V.B. Hartmann C. Sherman D.S. Cross G.A.M. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Prior to transfection, the vector is linearized at a unique BstXI site in the tubulin intragenic region which targets homologous recombination to the tubulin locus. pXS2 was tested using GUS as an expression reporter gene. A stably transformed GUS cell line was prepared and analyzed in two ways. First, correct targeted integration into the chromosomal tubulin locus was confirmed by Southern analysis. 2J. D. Bangs, E. M. Brouch, D. M. Ransom, and J. L. Roggy, unpublished observations. Second, GUS expression was readily detected by both enzymatic assay of cell extracts2 and by specific immunoprecipitation of GUS protein from metabolically radiolabeled cells (Fig. 3A, lane 1). In order to analyze the molecular signals mediating ER localization in trypanosomes it was first necessary to develop soluble reporters that are efficiently exported. To accomplish this, endogenous polypeptides of the trypanosomal secretory pathway, albeit cell-associated, were adapted as soluble reporters. First, modified BiP genes (Fig. 1B) were generated in which the putative C-terminal ER localization tetrapeptide, MDDL, was replaced with the viral HA9 immuno-epitope to allow discrimination of recombinant from endogenous BiP protein.

X-ray crystallographic, mutational, and modeling studies are providing detailed understanding of the interactions between the phorbol esters and individual PKC zinc fingers. In the present study, we explore the roles of the individual zinc fingers in the context of the intact enzyme. Our approach was to mutate either the first, the second, or both zinc fingers of PKCδ, to express the mutated enzyme in NIH 3T3 cells, and to monitor the effect of the mutations on the dose-response curve for translocation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The introduced mutations change into glycine the consensus proline in the phorbol ester binding loop of the zinc finger; in the isolated zinc finger, this mutation causes a 125-fold decrease in phorbol ester binding affinity. We observed that mutation in the first zinc finger caused almost no shift in the dose-response curve for translocation; mutation in the second zinc finger caused a 21-fold shift, whereas mutation in both zinc fingers caused a 138-fold shift. We conclude that the zinc fingers in the intact PKC are not equivalent and that the second zinc finger plays the predominant role in translocation of protein kinase Cδ in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

INTRODUCTIONProtein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. comprises a family of isozymes that mediate signal transduction for the lipophilic second messenger diacylglycerol, regulating a wide array of cellular processes (see Refs. 1Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar and 2Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar for review). PKC possesses two functional domains, an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. Within the regulatory domain lie two cysteine-rich zinc fingers, responsible for recognition by PKC of diacylglycerol or their ultrapotent analogs, the phorbol esters. In isolation, the individual first and second zinc fingers bind phorbol ester with similar affinities (3Burns D. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18330-18338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Quest A.F.G. Bardes E.S.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2953-2960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the molecular details of the interaction between the phorbol esters and the zinc finger domain are beginning to emerge. NMR spectroscopy has yielded the solution structure of the second zinc finger of PKCα (5Ichikawa S. Hatanaka H. Takeuchi Y. Ohno S. Inakagi F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6Hommel U. Zurini M. Luyten M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); the structure of the complex between the second zinc finger of PKCδ and phorbol 13-acetate has been solved by x-ray crystallography (7Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has further highlighted key residues within the zinc finger structure required for ligand binding (8Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and computer modeling is providing insight into how other high affinity ligands, e.g. the indole alkaloids, interact with the zinc finger.An issue that is only beginning to be addressed is the role of the individual zinc fingers within the context of the intact PKC molecule. In pioneering studies, Bell and co-workers (9Quest A.F.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20000-20012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had reported that the binding affinity of the second zinc finger of PKCγ was reduced in constructs containing sequences C-terminal to the zinc finger. Riedel and co-workers (10Shieh H.L. Hansen H. Zhu J. Riedel H. Mol. Carcinogen. 1995; 12: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) analyzed the effect of the deletion of the first or second zinc finger of PKCα in a phenotypic yeast assay; they reported that PMA showed a comparable loss in potency for activation of the deletion mutants at either site; mezerein activated predominantly through the first zinc finger, whereas (−)-indolactam V required both intact zinc fingers for activity. Unfortunately, interpretation of the results of deletion analysis is clouded by the extent of potential disruption of the structure of the holoenzyme; for example, the deletion of the first zinc finger also included the pseudosubstrate domain immediately N-terminal to it.As an alternative approach, we have introduced a proline to glycine mutation into the first or second or both zinc fingers of PKCδ. We had previously reported that this mutation, in the isolated zinc finger, preserves binding activity but causes a substantial loss (125-fold) in binding affinity (8Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We evaluated the quantitative influence of these mutations on recognition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the intact cell, using as an end point translocation of the mutant PKC from the soluble to the detergent-soluble particulate fraction. We report here that the zinc fingers in the intact PKC are not equivalent for inducing translocation and that the second zinc finger in the intact PKC has approximately 25-fold higher affinity for PMA than does the first zinc finger under these cellular conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPhorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA) and dissolved in ethanol.For site-directed mutagenesis of PKCδ, mouse PKCδ (a kind gift of H. Mischak and F. J. Mushinski) was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (11Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This plasmid served as our “master” vector for site-directed mutagenesis using the same selection primer as described in Ref. 11Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. The following oligonucleotides served as mutagenesis primers. 1) 5′-ACCTTCTTCGGGCAGTTCTGTTCT-3′ mutates the proline residue at position 169 into a glycine (bold letters) and creates the underlined KpnI restriction site to facilitate the detection of mutant plasmids. 2) 5′-AACTACATGAGCTTCTGTGACCAC-3′ mutates the proline residue at position 241 into a glycine (bold letters) and creates the underlined KpnI restriction site to facilitate the detection of mutant plasmids. The mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing (Paragon Biotech Inc., Baltimore, MD). The single mutants proline to glycine at site 169 (P169G), proline to glycine at site 241 (P241G), and the double mutant (P169G/P241G) were subcloned, along with the wild type, into an epitope tagging mammalian expression vector described elsewhere (12Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The constructs were transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and selected as described elsewhere (11Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).For the assessment of the amounts of soluble and membrane-associated mutant and wild type PKCδ, the cells were routinely treated with the indicated doses of PMA for 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 6 h at 37°C. The cells were harvested and lysed, and the soluble and Triton X-100-soluble particulate fractions were prepared as described previously. The protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The protein content of individual samples was determined (13Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the blots were stained using the polyclonal anti-PKCε antibody from Life Technologies, Inc. as described previously (13Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The densitometric analysis of the immunoblots and the normalization to the protein content of each individual lane were performed as described (13Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONUsing a previously described tagging system (12Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) we could readily distinguish the endogenous and overexpressed PKCδ. The tagged, overexpressed wild type PKCδ translocated with a time course and dose-response curve similar to that of the endogenous enzyme (data not shown), arguing against artifacts caused by the overexpression (13Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we had shown that the kinetics of translocation in response to various PKC activators depended on the PKC isozyme and the cellular system (14Szallasi Z. Kosa K. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.D. Williams E.K. Yuspa S.H. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 258-265PubMed Google Scholar). Under the present conditions, the translocation dose-response curves for the mutant and wild type PKC δ were stable by 60 min of exposure to PMA, and at this time point down-regulation was not yet detectable (data not shown and Ref. 13Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined the dose-response curves for translocation at this time point (Fig. 1). Data were fitted to the Hill equation.PMA translocated the wild type form of PKCδ with an ED50 of 13 ± 1 nM, showing excellent correlation with the data obtained for the endogenous enzyme in a previous publication (13Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation in the first zinc finger (P169G) caused a barely detectable 1.1-fold shift. Mutation in the second zinc finger alone (P241G) caused an approximately 21-fold shift, whereas mutations in both zinc fingers caused an approximately 138-fold shift (Fig. 2, Table I). Qualitatively, these data demonstrate that the two zinc fingers are not equivalent and the second zinc finger is the primary contributor to translocation of the native enzyme.Fig. 2PMA-induced changes in levels of wild type and mutant PKCδ in the cytosolic fraction of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the wild type or mutant forms of PKCδ were treated by the indicated doses of PMA for 60 min.

We assumed that PKC exists in four possible states in the presence of phorbol esters: 1) when no phorbol ester is bound to any of the zinc fingers (P0); 2) when only the first zinc finger binds phorbol ester (P1); 3) when only the second zinc finger binds phorbol ester (P2); and 4) when both zinc fingers bind phorbol ester (P1,2). Under equilibrium conditions the following equations describe the amount of PKC in the individual states, [L][P0]=k1[P0](Eq. 1) [L][P0]=k2[P2](Eq. 2) [L][P1]=k3[P1,2](Eq. 3) [L][P2]=k4[P1,2](Eq. 4) where [L] is the concentration of the free phorbol ester, and k1 through k4 are the apparent dissociation constants for the individual equilibria.Assuming that binding of phorbol ester to any or both zinc fingers causes translocation, the ratio of translocated to total PKC is described by the following equation. [P1]+[P2]+[P1,2][P0]+[P1]+[P2]+[P1,2]=[k3][L]+[k3][L]+1[k3][L]+[k3][L]+[k3][k3][L]2+1(Eq. 5) The concentration of phorbol ester at which half of the PKC is translocated, that is the ED50 value of the translocation dose-response curve, is as follows. [L0.5]=−([k3]+[k4])+([k3]+[k4])2+4[k1][k3]2(Eq. 6) Solving Equation 5, fitting it to the dose-response data for translocation (Fig. 2), we obtained the following apparent dissociation constants: 390 nM for k1, 15 nM for k2, 8.9 nM for k3, and 230 nM for k4, assuming that the dissociation constant of phorbol ester to each zinc finger is changed by a factor of 125 (7Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) upon the proline-glycine mutation. The shapes and slopes of the translocation curves as well as the ED50 values predicted from these parameters and Equation 5 show good agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 2) and with the empirical fit to the Hill equation (Table I).The derived parameters for translocation assist in the conceptual understanding of aspects of our experimental findings. Because of the difference between the zinc fingers in binding affinities, the first zinc finger has little influence on the ED50 for translocation either in the wild type or double mutant (contributing only 3.4% to the total translocation at the ED50) and negligible influence in the first zinc finger mutant (only 0.03% contribution to the total). This lack of contribution of the first zinc finger explains two otherwise paradoxical features. First, why the double mutant shows only a 138-fold shift in dose-response curve rather than a shift of 125 × 125-fold (i.e. 15,625-fold), which would have been expected had both zinc fingers contributed equally. Second, why the translocation fails to show strong positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient significantly larger than 1. Consistent with our model, the one mutant showing cooperativity is that in the second zinc finger, for which the two affinities are closest to one another and an effect on binding to both zinc fingers can be manifest.Our ongoing analysis, requiring different molecular constructs and methodologies, will hopefully provide insight into the relationship of the zinc fingers in translocation vis-a-vis other measures of PKC-ligand interaction such as enzymatic activation or ligand binding as determined directly.The findings reported here that the second zinc finger of PKCδ suffices for PKC translocation by PMA should not be overgeneralized. The model of PKC activation that emerged from the x-ray crystallographic structure for the zinc finger-phorbol ester complex (7Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) was that the phorbol ester capped a hydrophilic cleft in an otherwise hydrophobic surface on the zinc finger, promoting its ability to interact with the membrane. Obviously, two features of the phorbol ester will contribute to the energy of the ternary phorbol ester-zinc finger-phospholipid complex: 1) the ability of the functional groups of the phorbol ester to form hydrogen bonds with the corresponding functional groups within the cleft, together with van der Waals interactions between hydrophobic residues of the phorbol ester and corresponding hydrophobic regions in the cleft; 2) hydrophobic interactions of the phorbol ester side chains with the membrane. This latter contribution is what makes PMA a more potent ligand than phorbol 12,13-diacetate (15Kazanietz M.G. Krausz K.W. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20878-20886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for example. Whether the combination of these contributions to stabilization of the ternary complex is sufficient to drive membrane translocation upon occupancy of the second zinc finger alone will necessarily depend on the nature and concentration of the ligand, on the degree of negative surface charge of the membrane, and on other factors that may stabilize the unfolded form of the enzyme, i.e. occupancy of the catalytic site. Consistent with this concept, Riedel reported that the relatively hydrophilic ligand (−)-indolactam V was only able to generate a PKC response in yeast when neither zinc finger had been deleted (10Shieh H.L. Hansen H. Zhu J. Riedel H. Mol. Carcinogen. 1995; 12: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Our demonstration that the two zinc fingers of PKCδ are not equivalent for PKC translocation in NIH 3T3 cells agrees with the lack of equivalence reported by Riedel and co-workers using constructs of PKCα deleted in the individual zinc fingers and analyzed for their ability to modulate yeast cell growth as a function of ligand concentration (10Shieh H.L. Hansen H. Zhu J. Riedel H. Mol. Carcinogen. 1995; 12: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It likewise agrees qualitatively with the elegant study from Stubbs and co-workers (16Slater S.J. Ho C. Kelly M.B. Larkin J.D. Taddeo F.J. Yeager M.D. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4627-4631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) demonstrating biphasic binding in vitro to PKCα using the fluorescent phorbol ester analog sapintoxin D. In both cases, however, the substantial difference in methodologies prevents detailed comparison. Our current findings provide a framework for interpreting our earlier report, using PKCα, that we could distinguish two different interactions of phorbol esters with PKC that differed both in affinity and structure-activity (15Kazanietz M.G. Krausz K.W. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20878-20886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions limiting for membrane association, PKCα enzymatic activation required higher phorbol ester concentrations than did binding and had a greater dependence on the lipophilicity of the ligand. Although the full consequences of the asymmetry in the zinc fingers of PKC remain to be resolved, this issue appears to have great potential for the development of ligands that have novel effects on the PKC pathway.

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar for review). PKC possesses two functional domains, an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. Within the regulatory domain lie two cysteine-rich zinc fingers, responsible for recognition by PKC of diacylglycerol or their ultrapotent analogs, the phorbol esters. In isolation, the individual first and second zinc fingers bind phorbol ester with similar affinities (3Burns D. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

NMR spectroscopy has yielded the solution structure of the second zinc finger of PKCα (5Ichikawa S. Hatanaka H. Takeuchi Y. Ohno S. Inakagi F. J. Biochem.

Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has further highlighted key residues within the zinc finger structure required for ligand binding (8Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.A. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and computer modeling is providing insight into how other high affinity ligands, e.g. the indole alkaloids, interact with the zinc finger.An issue that is only beginning to be addressed is the role of the individual zinc fingers within the context of the intact PKC molecule. In pioneering studies, Bell and co-workers (9Quest A.F.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20000-20012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had reported that the binding affinity of the second zinc finger of PKCγ was reduced in constructs containing sequences C-terminal to the zinc finger. Riedel and co-workers (10Shieh H.L. Hansen H. Zhu J. Riedel H. Mol. Carcinogen. 1995; 12: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) analyzed the effect of the deletion of the first or second zinc finger of PKCα in a phenotypic yeast assay; they reported that PMA showed a comparable loss in potency for activation of the deletion mutants at either site; mezerein activated predominantly through the first zinc finger, whereas (−)-indolactam V required both intact zinc fingers for activity. Unfortunately, interpretation of the results of deletion analysis is clouded by the extent of potential disruption of the structure of the holoenzyme; for example, the deletion of the first zinc finger also included the pseudosubstrate domain immediately N-terminal to it.As an alternative approach, we have introduced a proline to glycine mutation into the first or second or both zinc fingers of PKCδ. We had previously reported that this mutation, in the isolated zinc finger, preserves binding activity but causes a substantial loss (125-fold) in binding affinity (8Kazanietz M.G. Wang S.

We evaluated the quantitative influence of these mutations on recognition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the intact cell, using as an end point translocation of the mutant PKC from the soluble to the detergent-soluble particulate fraction. We report here that the zinc fingers in the intact PKC are not equivalent for inducing translocation and that the second zinc finger in the intact PKC has approximately 25-fold higher affinity for PMA than does the first zinc finger under these cellular conditions.

This receptor, designated P2Y7, has 352 amino acids and shares 23-30% amino acid identity with the P2Y1-P2Y6 purinoceptors. The P2Y7 cDNA was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells: binding studies thereon showed a very high affinity for ATP (37 ± 6 nM), much less for UTP and ADP (~1300 nM), and a novel rank order of affinities in the binding series studied of 8 nucleotides and suramin. The P2Y7 receptor sequence appears to denote a different subfamily from that of all the other known P2Y purinoceptors, with only a few of their characteristic sequence motifs shared. The P2Y7 receptor mRNA is abundantly present in the human heart and the skeletal muscle, moderately in the brain and liver, but not in the other tissues tested. The P2Y7 receptor mRNA was also abundantly present in the rat heart and cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The P2Y7 receptor is functionally coupled to phospholipase C in COS-7 cells transiently expressing this receptor. The P2Y7 gene was shown to be localized to human chromosome 14.

Cell Membrane Receptors for Drugs and Hormones: A Multidisciplinary Approach. Raven Press, New York1978: 107Google Scholar). A number of such G protein-coupled ATP receptors have been characterized and a consensus on their nomenclature has termed all of these as P2Y purinoceptors (to be individually named P2Y1 to P2Yn), regardless of previous terminology such as P2U or P2T for subclasses thereof (2Fredholm B.B.

The first such receptors to be characterized by DNA cloning and expression were the P2Y1 receptor (where UTP is inactive) (3Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F.

The HEL cell cDNA library was a gift from Dr. Jerry Ware, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA. α-[32P]dCTP, α-[32P]CTP, and α-[35S]dATP were from DuPont NEN; other materials (and procedures where not specified) were as described previously (6Ayyanathan K.

The complete nucleotide sequence of both strands was determined by dideoxy chain termination using T3 and T7 primers and synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the previously determined sequence. The nucleotide sequence analysis and dendrogram construction were performed using the GCG package. The P2Y7 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The expression construct (pcDNA3-P2Y7) was transfected into COS-7 cells, and the transfected cells were harvested. Those procedures and also the binding assays with [35S]dATPαS (at ~22°C) on membranes of transfected cells were as described elsewhere (15Simon J. Webb T.E. King B. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. Eur. J.

Nonspecific binding rose from 5% of the total binding up to 20% at saturation and was subtracted. Vector-transfected cells gave no specific binding (15Simon J. Webb T.E. King B. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 291: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The inositol phosphates were measured essentially as described elsewhere (16Nakahata N. Harden T.K.

COS-7 cells, 24 h after transfection, were labeled with 1 µCi/ml of myo-[2-3H]inositol in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Labeled cells were washed once, the medium was replaced with 890 µl of 20 mM HEPES-buffered Eagle's medium, pH 7.4, without LiCl, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min before proceeding. This step helps to reduce background levels of [3H]inositol phosphates, so that agonist-stimulated accumulation could be detected more easily. After incubation for 30 min at 37°C in [3H]inositol-free medium, 10 µl of LiCl were added to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. The cells were stimulated with ATP (20 µM) in 100 µl for 15 min and the reaction was terminated by aspiration of the medium and addition of 0.5 ml of methanol. The cells were scraped and rinsed with 0.5 ml of methanol. The pooled methanol fraction (1 ml) was combined with chloroform (1 ml) and water (0.9 ml). After centrifugation, the upper phase was applied to a column containing 1-ml bed volume of resin (AG1 X8; 100-200 mesh formate form; Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 5 mM inositol and 5 mM sodium tetraborate, followed by 60 mM ammonium formate and total inositol phosphates were eluted with 1.5 M ammonium formate, 100 mM formic acid. The radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. For the cAMP measurements, 48 h after the transfection, the cells were loaded with [3H]adenine, and the agonist-stimulated intracellular cAMP levels were determined as described earlier (14Kunapuli S.P.

The total RNA was prepared from the rat heart and HEL cells using RNazol (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX), following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from the rat heart, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and HEL cells was separated by 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis (18Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boetker M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nylon membrane. Somatic cell genomic PCR products (10 µl) or RT-PCR products, separated on 1.0% agarose gel, were transferred to nylon membranes using standard procedures. The cRNA was labeled with α-[32P]CTP using a riboprobe kit (Promega Biotech Inc.) to a specific activity of 1-3 × 109 cpm/µg and was hybridized with Northern blots, including a human multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), or with Southern blots for 16-20 h at 65°C in a buffer containing 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 100 µg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 2% SDS. The blot was washed with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 1 h followed by a high stringency wash with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 1 h. Autoradiography was at −80°C for 12-16 h. A set of forward and reverse primers were chosen from the sequencing primers of P2Y7 cDNA clone. The sense primer, SPK205C (5′-GGGGCTTCCCGGCAACAG-3′), corresponds to the 397-414 nucleotide region and the antisense primer, SPK206C (5′- GCAGCTTGGCGACGAAGC-3′), corresponds to 1200-1217 nucleotides of the P2Y7 receptor cDNA sequence. PCR conditions were optimized using human, mouse, and Chinese hamster genomic DNAs (~500 ng) to ensure that amplification of a product of the expected size occurs only with human DNA. After initial denaturation for 5 min at 94°C, the amplifications were carried out for 35 cycles using 5.0 units of Pfu DNA polymerase as follows: 94°C for 1 min, 54°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min followed by 7 min at 72°C. Genomic DNA (~500 ng) from human, mouse, Chinese hamster, or mouse/human somatic cell hybrids was used as template. The first strand cDNA was prepared from HEL cell total RNA (5 µg) by oligo(dT) priming with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting cDNA was used as the template in a PCR with the P2Y7 receptor specific primers, SPK205C and SPK206C, as described above. We have previously cloned the human P2Y1 (6Ayyanathan K.

Mills D.C.B. Kunapuli S.P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: #684Google Scholar) receptor cDNAs from a HEL cell cDNA library. In the present study, we screened the same library in λgt11 with the radiolabeled chicken P2Y3 cDNA under low stringency hybridization conditions. Upon screening ~500,000 plaques, a single cDNA clone, designated HP212, was isolated and sequenced. The full-length cDNA clone is ~1.6 kb in length and contains an open reading frame of 1056 bp which is flanked by 304 bp of 5′-untranslated and 250-bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. The 5′-untranslated sequence is relatively GC rich and the 3′-untranslated sequence ends with a poly(A) tail. The initiator methionine, encoded by the first in-frame ATG in the sequence, has a purine at the −3 position, which is the most conserved position in the Kozak (19Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) consensus sequence. The amino acid sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence of HP212 revealed that this cDNA codes for 352 amino acids (Fig. 1) with an estimated molecular weight of 37,682 daltons, without accounting for glycosylation. The hydrophobicity analysis of this cDNA indicates the seven transmembrane domains (Fig. 1, I-VII) of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The receptor encoded by HP212 has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites at identical positions to those of the P2Y3 receptor sequence (9Webb T.E. Henderson D. King B.F. Wang S. Simon J. Bateson A.N. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar): one (residue 4) in the extracellular amino-terminal segment and the other (residue 166) in the second extracellular domain. The sequence also contains several serine/threonine phosphorylation residues in the carboxyl-terminal segment (14 out of 62 residues). The receptor has 27% amino acid identity to P2Y1 (6Ayyanathan K.

As the next such clone reported, we have designated the receptor encoded by HP212 as P2Y7. The P2Y7 receptor sequence appears to denote a different subfamily from that of the other known P2Y purinoceptors, with only a few of their characteristic sequence motifs shared: these include the conserved histidine in deduced transmembrane domain VI, but not the nearby arginine, and a basic residue near the start of domain VII but not a second therein (Fig. 1). However, adjacent basic residues occur just before domain VII. Construction of a dendrogram of all the known P2Y purinoceptors confirmed that the P2Y7 receptor forms a distinct branch (Fig. 2). Thus the P2Y7 receptor is a unique member of the P2 purinoceptor family.Fig. 2A dendrogram showing the relatedness of the amino acid sequences of known P2Y purinoceptors.

Pharmacol. 1995; 291: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) but very low affinity for the endogenous nucleotide binding sites on COS-7 cells. Saturable, specific binding sites for this radioligand were expressed, as illustrated in Fig. 3; analysis indicated a single class of high affinity binding sites, the Hill coefficient being 0.98 ± 0.08. The dissociation constant was 4.03 ± 1 nM. The expression was consistently efficient, with the maximal binding (Bmax) 12.3 ± 1.9 pmol of dATPαS bound/mg of membrane protein. (All values quoted are means ± S.E. for at least three transfections, with triplicate measurements made on each). This binding could be displaced (Table I) by a range of P2 purinoceptor-active nucleotides and also by suramin, an antagonist at micromolar concentrations at most P2Y receptors (2Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity series found (ATP = 2-Cl-ATP = ATPγS > 2-MeSATP > β,γ-meATP > ADP = UTP) is quite distinct from any known for the P2Y1-P2Y6 receptors. The significant affinity for β,γ-meATP is unique for a P2Y receptor.Table IKi values for binding to the P2Y7 receptor expressed in COS-7 cellsLigandKinMdATPαS7.32-Cl-ATP24 ± 5ATPγS22 ± 2ATP37 ± 62-MeSATP108 ± 18β,γ-MeATP568 ± 220ADP1300 ± 130UTP1351 ± 440Suramin2900 ± 2100AdenosineInactive, at 100 µM Open table in a new tab We have investigated whether the P2Y7 receptor is coupled to phospholipase C activation, as is common in this series. As seen in Fig. 4, in COS-7 cells transiently expressing the P2Y7 receptor 20 µM ATP stimulated the production of total inositol phosphates about 2-fold, while the stimulation in the cells transiently expressing the mouse P2Y2 receptor is ~5.3-fold. In contrast, 20 µM ATP has no effect on the cells transfected with vector alone, as also found previously (15Simon J. Webb T.E. King B. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 291: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the P2Y7 receptor is coupled to phospholipase C. For comparison, COS-7 cells transiently expressing the P2Y1 receptor have been shown to stimulate inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate formation about 2.7-fold with 1 µM ATP (15Simon J. Webb T.E. King B. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 291: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The effect for P2Y7 is lower, which may indicate that the natural G protein partner is different and is low or is absent, and inefficiently substituted by another, in COS-7 cells. To examine potential coupling of the P2Y7 receptor to adenylate cyclase through a stimulatory G protein, Gs, the effects of nucleotides on cellular cyclic AMP levels were examined in COS-7 cells transiently expressing the vector alone or the P2Y7 expression vector (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, neither P2Y7 receptor-transfected nor vector-transfected COS-7 cells caused stimulation of cAMP levels in response to 20 µM ATP. Under identical conditions, COS-7 cells transfected, as a positive control, with the prostaglandin IP receptor caused ~13.5-fold increase in intracellular cAMP levels in response to 100 nM Iloprost. PCR amplification of human genomic DNA with human P2Y7 receptor specific primers resulted in a PCR product of 821 bp as expected, while no amplification occurred with mouse or hamster DNA. When PCR was carried out with DNA from the panel of somatic cell hybrids as template, amplification of the expected size product was observed only in the DNA from the hybrid that contained human chromosome 14. Hybridization of a P2Y7 specific probe to the Southern blots of positive PCR products, including the control human DNA, resulted in a signal (Fig. 6). No signal was observed in the lanes with mouse or hamster DNA (Fig. 6) or with any of the hybrids that did not yield PCR products of the expected size (not shown). These results confirm that the PCR product represents the human gene and is not due to nonspecific amplification. The genes so far localized for human P2 purinoceptors are on different chromosomes: P2Y1 on chromosome 3 (6Ayyanathan K. Webb T.E. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), P2Y2 on chromosome 11 (20Dasari V.R. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Mills D.C.B. Kunapuli S.P. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 21: 75-79Crossref Google Scholar), and P2Y4 on the X chromosome (10Nguyen T. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Marchese A. Heng H.H.Q. Garrad R.C. George S.R. Turner J.T. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30845-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of P2Y7 was analyzed by Northern hybridization on a human multiple tissue Northern blot containing 2 µg of poly(A)+ RNA from eight human tissues. A radiolabeled cRNA of P2Y7 hybridized to an mRNA of ~1.6 kb, with the highest levels in the human heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 7A). There are much lower levels in the brain and liver, and low to negligible levels in the other tissues tested (Fig. 7A). The tissue distribution of P2Y7 is in contrast toother P2 purinoceptors. The 7.0-kb P2Y1 mRNA is present in the human placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas (6Ayyanathan K. Webb T.E. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), while the 2.1-kb human P2Y2 mRNA is expressed abundantly in skeletal muscle and nasal epithelium (7Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the P2Y4 mRNA is exclusively expressed in the human placenta (11Communi D. Pirotton S. Marmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30849-30852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The unique tissue distribution of the P2Y7 receptor (Fig. 7) among the P2 purinoceptor family could imply a physiological function in regulating cardiac muscle contraction, while P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y7 play a role in skeletal muscle contraction (as well as elsewhere). Northern hybridization was also performed on total RNA from the rat heart and cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and showed that the P2Y7 receptor mRNA is abundantly present in both these samples (Fig. 7B). The rat orthologue of the P2Y7 receptor mRNA is larger (~2.0 kb) than the human P2Y7 receptor mRNA. The P2Y7 receptor is at a lower abundance in HEL cells than in rat cardiomyocytes or heart, since it was below the level of detection in a Northern blot under the same conditions for all these samples. However, RT-PCR analysis of the HEL cell RNA resulted in a PCR product of 821 bp, indicating that the P2Y7 receptor mRNA is expressed in HEL cells (Fig. 8). We have found the P2Y7 receptor mRNA to be the most abundant in cardiac and skeletal muscle. For adult skeletal muscle, ATP has been found to facilitate acetylcholine stimulation via an unidentified second messenger pathway (21Lu Z. Smith D.O. J. Physiol. 1991; 436: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and in rat diaphragm ATPγS increases inositol phosphate formation (22Heilbronn E. Eriksson H. Sellin L.C. Libelius R. Thesleff S. Neuromuscular Junction. Elsevier, Amsterdam1989: 395Google Scholar). For cardiac myocytes, while some ATP-induced cationic currents seen there may be due to P2X purinoceptors, the positive inotropic effects of ATP and its potent ability to increase calcium transients in stimulated rat heart and to increase the L-type calcium current in cardiac myocytes have been attributed to metabotropic (P2Y) purinoceptors (23Zheng J.- Christie A. Levy M.N. Scarpa A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1411-C1417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wang D.S. Cusack N.J. Belardinelli L.

ATP was found to be active on ventricular myocytes with EC50 ~300 nM and 2-MeSATP and ATPγS were similarly highly potent (24Wang D.S. Cusack N.J. Belardinelli L. Circulation. 1993; 88: 431-434Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The cardiac P2 purinoceptors have been shown to couple to stimulation of inositol phosphate stimulation through phospholipase C (27Legssyer A. Poggioli J. Renard D. Vassort G. J. Physiol. 1988; 401: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and have been suggested also to couple to a Gs type without stimulation of cAMP levels (28Scamps F. Rybin V. Puceat M. Tkachuk V. Vassort G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 675-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Based upon these and similar reports, and the binding properties, functional characteristics, and cardiac mRNA abundance of the P2Y7 receptor, we suggest that this subtype, in addition to being one of the few P2Y receptors expressed in a hematopoietic cell lineage, is involved in cardiac muscle regulation. In conclusion, we have cloned a novel P2 purinergic receptor with unique pharmacological profile and tissue distribution, and localized the P2Y7 gene to human chromosome 14. This receptor is most probably the cardiac P2Y purinoceptor involved in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction through modulation of L-type calcium currents. We are grateful to Dr. Steven R. Houser, Department of Physiology, Temple University Medical School, for providing us with neonatal rat cardiomyocyte RNA, and to Dr. David Julius, University of California, San Francisco, for providing us with the mouse P2Y2 receptor cDNA clone."

Recombinant h-apoB48, like endogenous rat apoB48 (r-apoB48), was secreted as VLDL in addition to high density lipoproteins (HDL) by transfected cells, indicating that the N-terminal 48% of apoB contains sequences sufficient for VLDL assembly. Truncation of the C terminus of h-apo-B48 to -B42 or -B37 had little effect on the ability of apoB to assemble VLDL, whereas truncation to -B34 or -B29 markedly diminished or abolished VLDL formation. None of the truncations affected the integration of apoB into HDL. To determine whether the ability to assemble VLDL is governed by apoB length or by sequences beyond apoB29, we created chimeric proteins that contained human apoA-I and a segment derived from between the C-terminal 29 and 34%, 34 and 37%, or 37 and 42% of apoB100. The resulting chimeras, namely AI/B29-34, AI/B34-37, and AI/B37-42, were secreted by the transfected cells as lipoproteins with buoyant density (d < 1.006 g/ml), electrophoretic mobility (pre-β), and size characteristics of human plasma VLDL. The chimeras could assemble discrete VLDL particles devoid of endogenous r-apoB100, and could actively recruit triglycerides and phospholipids into the lipoproteins. However, these chimeras were secreted inefficiently. Pulse-chase analysis showed that less than 5% of the newly synthesized AI/B proteins were secreted, and more than 70% was degraded intracellularly. Degradation of the chimeras could be blocked by the cysteine protease inhibitor N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, but the treatment did not enhance their secretion. Protease protection analysis of microsomes isolated from transfected cells indicated that >65% of AI/B chimeras (compared with <25% of r-apoB100) were inaccessible to exogenous trypsin. These data suggest that the recruitment of large quantities of triglycerides during VLDL formation is not governed simply by apoB length, but is mediated by short hydrophobic sequences ranging from 152 to 237 amino acids (3-5%) of apoB.

The enormous size and lipophilic properties of these two polypeptides have been suggested to underlie their ability to recruit triglycerides into hepatic very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intestinal chylomicrons (2Knott T.J. Pease R.J. Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Rall Jr., Innerarity T.L. Blackhart B. Taylor W.H. Marcel Y. Milne R. Johnson D. Fuller M. Lusis A.J. McCarthy B.J. Levy-Wilson B. Scott J. Nature. 1986; 323: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Early studies of C-terminally truncated apoB variants found in human familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (3Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have provided in vivo evidence that the ability of apoB to recruit lipids is compromised by the truncation. Subsequently, the impact of apoB length on the extent of lipid recruitment during apoB-containing lipoprotein (LpB) formation has been demonstrated by several laboratories using transfected cell lines expressing the truncated forms of human apoB (h-apoB) (4Yao Z.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo observations and cell culture studies combined have unambiguously shown that the length of apoB polypeptide plays an important role in the formation of LpB. Despite this evidence, several other in vivo observations have indicated that the ability of apoB to form VLDL may not be solely determined by the length of the polypeptide. The most compelling evidence is that apoB48, a protein only half the size of apoB100, can mediate the assembly and secretion of both chylomicrons (in the intestine) and VLDL (in the liver of rats and mice). Moreover, some of the C-terminally truncated forms of apoB (e.g. apoB37) have been detected in plasma VLDL of subjects with hypobetalipoproteinemia (3Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability to assemble triglyceride-rich lipoproteins can not be simply a function of apoB length as suggested by the cell culture studies. Rather, amino acid sequences that reside within the N-terminal 48%, or even within 37%, of apoB100 may play important roles in the assembly of triglyceride-rich LpB. apolipoprotein very low density lipoprotein apoB-containing lipoproteins human apoB endoplasmic reticulum microsomal triglyceride transfer protein high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal human apoA-I rat apoB Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium oleate supplemented. Assembly of VLDL in the liver is a complex process perhaps occurring in multiple steps. Experimental evidence accumulated so far suggests that assembly of VLDL, at least the apoB48-containing VLDL in rat liver, may proceed through two steps. The initial step occurs as the apoB polypeptide translocates from the cytosolic to the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (8Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a process presumably facilitated by the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (10Gordon D.A. Wetterau J. Gregg R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) in the presence of sufficient lipid supply. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the apoB sequences involved in the translocation process, showing that the rate of apoB translocation across the ER membrane could regulate the level of apoB secretion. It has been observed that translocation of apoB may pause (11Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22794-22801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or even stop (13Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), producing several transmembrane intermediates of apoB. Indeed, immunoreactive apoB has been detected on the cytosolic side of hepatic microsomal membranes (14Davis R.D. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20937-20952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested by some (18Nakahara D.H. Lingappa V.R. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7617-7622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but disputed by others (19Pease R.J. Harrison G.B. Scott J. Nature. 1991; 353: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), that translocation pausing is essential for lipidation of the apoB polypeptides. Translocation arrested apoB polypeptides, resulting from insufficient lipid supply, probably do not participate in LpB assembly and are ultimately degraded. Little is known about the mechanism that is responsible for apoB degradation, nor is it clear which specific apoB sequences are involved in lipid recruitment during the initial step of VLDL assembly. Biochemical evidence for the second step of hepatic apoB48-VLDL assembly has recently been presented (20Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that following an initial co-translational assembly step which generates an apoB48-containing species resembling high density lipoprotein (HDL), a so-called “second step” takes place in which a large amount of neutral lipid is recruited to convert this primordial apoB48-HDL to apoB48-VLDL. In rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells, the second step was dependent upon oleate supplementation of the culture medium (20Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This two-step model is in accord with previous observations (21Elovson J. Bell G.T. Doolittle M.H. Phillips M. Circulation. 1992; 86 (Suppl. I): 693Google Scholar) and is supported by recent studies (22Swift L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using primary rat hepatocytes. The current study was intended to search for sequences within h-apoB48 that mediate the second step lipid recruitment during VLDL synthesis. The in vivo data obtained from studies of human hypobetalipoproteinemia also suggest that C-terminal truncation of apoB100 may impair apoB's ability to recruit lipid during VLDL assembly. While the relatively large truncated apoB forms (e.g. ≥apoB37) were invariably found in VLDL and low density lipoproteins (LDL) in addition to HDL, the short forms (e.g. apo-B31 and -B32.5) were found only in HDL and the d > 1.21 g/ml fractions (3Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 521-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data imply that apo-B31 and -B32.5 may not contain the sequences necessary for VLDL formation, whereas apoB37 does. A recently proposed pentapartite structural model of human apoB100 (h-apoB100) suggests that the protein is composed of three amphipathic α helix domains and two amphipathic β strand domains (23Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). One of the β strand domains is located within apoB48 (between apo-B18 and -B43) which may represent the functional lipid-binding domain engaged in the second step lipidation to form VLDL. Alternatively, the in vivo data from hypobetalipoproteinemia may suggest that the requirement for the second step lipidation of apoB could be determined by the length of lipid-binding sequences, since hydrophobic structures that potentially mediate apoB binding to lipids are distributed quite evenly throughout the h-apoB100 molecule (2Knott T.J. Pease R.J. Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Rall Jr., Innerarity T.L. Blackhart B. Taylor W.H. Marcel Y. Milne R. Johnson D. Fuller M. Lusis A.J. McCarthy B.J. Levy-Wilson B. Scott J. Nature. 1986; 323: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In this study, we used five C-terminally truncated h-apoB forms and three chimeras containing h-apoB segments that were expressed in stably transfected McA-RH7777 cells to determine whether the sequence requirement for hepatic VLDL assembly is determined by apoB length or by domains within the protein. Our results suggest that the amphipathic β strands between the C termini of apo-B29 and -B42 (B29-42) play important roles in VLDL assembly, and segments (as short as 152 amino acids) derived from B29-42 are sufficient to mediate VLDL formation. DNA restriction and modification enzymes, and oligonucleotide linkers were purchased from New England Biolabs or from Life Technologies, Inc. Sequenase (Version 2.0) was obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. All reagents for cell culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) from Bio-Rad Laboratories.

Thompson J.J. Borchardt R.A. Gallaher W.R. J. Lipid. Res. 1989; 30: 1185-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monoclonal (27Wong L. Gadams N.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 918: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) antibodies to rat apoB (r-apoB) were gifts from R. Davis (San Diego State University) and L. Wong (Louisiana State University), respectively. Rabbit antibody to bovine protein disulfide isomerase was a gift from M. Michalak (University of Alberta). All expression plasmids were prepared using the vector pCMV5 (28Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from which polylinker sequence between the HindIII and XbaI restriction sites had been removed. Truncated apoB cDNAs were prepared using pB53L-L (29Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Johnson D.F. Taylor S.M. Haubold K.W. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1175-1182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as starting material. The plasmid pB42 (nucleotides 20-5849 of the apoB100 cDNA) was generated by excision of the EcoRI to ClaI fragment from pB53L-L and ligation into pCMV5 that had been digested with the same enzymes. The plasmid pB37 (nucleotides 20-5290 of the apoB cDNA) was created by removal of the SalI-SalI fragment from pB53L-L and recircularization of the remaining fragment with T4 DNA ligase. To create the plasmid pB34 (nucleotides 20-4838 of the apoB cDNA), pB37 was digested with DraI, ligated with an MluI linker, and digested with EcoRI and MluI to obtain the apoB insert which was then ligated into pCMV5 that had been digested with EcoRI and MluI. The plasmid pB29 (nucleotides 20-4124 of the apoB cDNA) was generated by XhoI digestion of pB34, end-filling with Klenow polymerase, ligation with MluI linker, digestion with EcoRI and MluI to release the B29 fragment and ligation of the fragment into pCMV5 that had been digested with the same enzymes. The non-apoB amino acids introduced by cloning at the C termini of the apoB proteins were: KL in apoB42, RL in apoB37, FDAYR in apoB34, and DAYR in apoB29. An EcoRI-StuI fragment encoding the N-terminal 217 amino acids of h-apoA-I was excised from the apoA-I cDNA (30McLeod R.S. Robbins C. Burns A. Yao Z. Pritchard P.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The blunt StuI end was ligated with a ClaI linker, and the resulting 800-base pair fragment was ligated into pCMV5 that had been digested with EcoRI and ClaI to create pAI/StuI. The expression plasmids, pAI/B29-34, pAI/B34-37 and pAI/B37-42 were assembled using the 800-base pair EcoRI-StuI fragment and corresponding apoB sequences. Appropriate linker oligonucleotides (NcoI linker for pAI/B29-34 and pAI/B37-42, MluI linker for pAI/B34-37) were ligated to the 3′ end of the EcoRI/StuI fragment to accept the apoB sequences. To obtain the B29-34 segment (nucleotides 4124-4838 of the apoB cDNA), pB34 was digested with XhoI (nucleotide 4124 of the apoB cDNA), end-filled, ligated with NcoI linkers, and excised by digestion with NcoI and MluI (located in the pCMV5 polylinker). The B34-37 segment (nucleotides 4838-5290 of the apoB cDNA) was obtained from pB37 by DraI digestion (nucleotide 4838 of the apoB cDNA), ligated with MluI linker, and excised by MluI and XbaI digestion. For the B37-42 segment (nucleotides 5290-5848 of the apoB cDNA), a 550-base pair SalI-SalI fragment (from nucleotide 5290 of the apoB cDNA to pCMV5 polylinker) was excised from pB42, end-filled, ligated with NcoI linker, and digested with NcoI and ClaI (located in the pCMV5 polylinker). To assemble the pAI/B plasmids, the pCMV5 vector was digested with EcoRI and MluI (for pAI/B29-34), XbaI (for pAI/B34-37), or ClaI (for pAI/B37-42). Compatibly linkered apoA-I and apoB fragments were inserted into appropriately digested pCMV5 by a three-piece ligation reaction. Extraneous amino acids, introduced at the junctions between the apoA-I and apoB sequences by the ligation procedures, were: PWL in pAI/B29-34, DAS in pAI/B34-37, and PW in pAI/B37-42. For in vitro transcription and translation studies, the AI/B chimera coding sequences were excised from the pCMV expression constructs by EcoRI and MluI digestion and inserted into pSPT19 (Pharmacia). Expression of AI/B chimeras was driven by the SP6 promoter. All expression plasmids, purified twice by CsCl gradient centrifugation, were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion, and by DNA sequencing to verify the pAI/B junctions and the C-terminal amino acid codons, respectively. McA-RH7777 cells (CRL-1601) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cell culture conditions, transfection protocols, and selection of stable transformants were performed as described previously (31Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8358-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the truncated apoB and AI/B chimera plasmids generated above. Transfected cells (70-80% confluent in 100-mm dishes) were incubated for up to 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20% serum (standard medium), or in oleate-supplemented medium (OS medium, standard medium supplemented with 0.4 mM oleate conjugated with bovine serum albumin). The conditioned media (5 ml) were fractionated by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose density gradient (20Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to separate lipoproteins between 1.006 and 1.17 g/ml (47% (w/v) sucrose) or 1.25 g/ml (54% (w/v) sucrose). After centrifugation (35,000 rpm, 65 h in SW41 Ti rotor), 12 fractions (~1 ml each) were collected from the top of the tube. Lipoproteins in each fraction were concentrated by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies to apoB (for truncated h-apoB variants) or to apoA-I (for chimeras), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by immunoblot analysis as described previously (8Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ultracentrifugally isolated VLDL were fractionated on thin agarose films (Lipogel, Beckman Instruments) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After completion of electrophoresis, the lipoproteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the presence of r-apoB, h-apoB or h-apoAI was revealed by immunoblot analysis using the appropriate antibodies as described previously (32Yao Z. Lauer S.J. Sanan D.A. Fazio S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling and pulse-chase analysis of the recombinant proteins using [35S]methionine/cysteine were performed as described previously (9McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, serum, oleate and the cysteine protease inhibitor ALLN were included in the labeling or chase media as indicated in the figure legends. In experiments where both lipids and apolipoproteins were labeled, the cells (60-mm dishes) were incubated with 15 µCi [3H]glycerol and 200 µCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine for up to 4 h in 2 ml of cysteine- and methionine-free DMEM containing 20% serum. Since the cell density has been shown to have an important effect on lipid and apolipoprotein synthesis and secretion in McA-RH7777 cells (33Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we performed labeling experiments at similar cell densities (cell protein variation within 15%) with the transfected cells. Medium VLDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and AI/B chimera-containing species were purified by immunoadsorption (see below). Lipids were extracted from the immunoadsorbant beads with chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) and resolved by thin layer chromatography as described previously (34Selby S.L. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1900-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The 3H-labeled triglyceride and phosphatidylcholine were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Apolipoproteins were released from the delipidated immunoadsorbant beads using SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (3-15% gels), and 35S-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography as described previously (9McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A h-apoAI-specific immunoadsorbant was prepared by covalently coupling monoclonal antibody 5F6 to cyanogen bromide activated agarose. Ultracentrifugally isolated VLDL were incubated at 4°C with the immunoadsorbant beads under non-denaturing conditions for 16-24 h in phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were then pelleted in a microcentrifuge and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the bound fraction was extracted for analysis of lipids or protein as described above. All isolation procedures were performed at 0-4°C. Transfected cells from two 100-mm dishes were combined and disrupted by 20 passes through a ball bearing homogenizer (H & Y Enterprise, Redwood City, CA) in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM leupeptin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (100 kallikrein inhibitor units/ml), and ALLN (40 µg/ml). Intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and microsomes were isolated from the postnuclear supernatant as a pellet following centrifugation for 15 min at 400,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor. The microsomes were resuspended in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 250 mM sucrose. To release the lumenal content fraction, the microsomes were treated with 0.1 M sodium carbonate, pH 11.3, on ice for 30 min as described elsewhere (20Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For protease digestion experiments, protease inhibitors were removed from the microsome preparations by ultracentrifugation in buffer without protease inhibitors, and proteolysis was performed immediately (35Rusiñol A.E. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13318-13325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The AI/B expression plasmids (prepared in pSPT19) were linearized by PvuII digestion and transcribed for 60 min using SP6 polymerase (Riboprobe Core System, Promega). The transcripts were purified and subsequently translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) containing [35S]methionine in the presence of rat liver microsomes (16Rusiñol A.E. Chan E.Y.W. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the translation mixture were treated with trypsin in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 as described above. Cell protein was quantified according to Lowry et al. (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. It was reported that endogenous r-apoB48 of McA-RH7777 cells could assemble VLDL through two steps in an oleate-dependent manner (20Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we first determined the effect of sequential C-terminal truncation of human apoB48 on its ability to assemble VLDL. Four truncated proteins: h-apo-B29, -B34, -B37, and -B42, in addition to h-apoB48 (33Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were expressed in McA-RH7777 cells (Fig. 1A). The h-apoB of the appropriate molecular weight and immunoreactivity was detected in the medium of each stably transfected cell line by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B). Under standard cell culture conditions (i.e. DMEM containing 20% serum), all of the secreted h-apoBs were associated with HDL (d = 1.08-1.18 g/ml) species (data not shown), consistent with previous results using the same expression system (4Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the culture medium was supplemented with oleate (0.4 mM), a portion of the secreted h-apoB48 was recovered in VLDL (Fig. 1C, fractions 1 and 2) in addition to HDL (fractions 8-10). This result suggests that recombinant h-apoB48, like r-apoB48, can also assemble VLDL in an oleate-dependent manner in the transfected cells. The oleate-dependent VLDL formation was also observed for the C-terminally truncated h-apoBs such as h-apo-B42, -B37, and -B34, indicating that the ability to assemble VLDL was not severely affected by the truncation (although VLDL formation by"

https://openalex.org/W1967327478,"In human monocytes, interleukin 1β protein production and steady state mRNA levels are increased in response to lipopolysaccharide, predominantly as a result of increased transcription of the interleukin 1β gene. Expression of interleukin 1β and other cytokines, such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor α, has been shown to be dependent on the activation of the transcription factor, NFκB. Since recent studies have shown that lipopolysaccharide-induced tyrosine kinase activation is not required for NFκB nuclear translocation, we sought to determine whether NFκB translocated in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity was active in stimulating transcription.We have found that, in the human pro-monocytic cell line, THP-1, the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of interleukin 1β is dependent on tyrosine kinase activation. Tyrosine kinases are not required for lipopolysaccharide-mediated nuclear translocation of NFκB. However, in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity, the ability of NFκB to stimulate transcription is impaired. This inhibition of transcription is specific for NFκB; in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity, AP-1-dependent transcription is enhanced. These results suggest that, while lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of inflammatory mediators requires tyrosine kinase activity, tyrosine kinase activity is not obligatory for lipopolysaccharide signal transduction. In human monocytes, interleukin 1β protein production and steady state mRNA levels are increased in response to lipopolysaccharide, predominantly as a result of increased transcription of the interleukin 1β gene. Expression of interleukin 1β and other cytokines, such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor α, has been shown to be dependent on the activation of the transcription factor, NFκB. Since recent studies have shown that lipopolysaccharide-induced tyrosine kinase activation is not required for NFκB nuclear translocation, we sought to determine whether NFκB translocated in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity was active in stimulating transcription. We have found that, in the human pro-monocytic cell line, THP-1, the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of interleukin 1β is dependent on tyrosine kinase activation. Tyrosine kinases are not required for lipopolysaccharide-mediated nuclear translocation of NFκB. However, in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity, the ability of NFκB to stimulate transcription is impaired. This inhibition of transcription is specific for NFκB; in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity, AP-1-dependent transcription is enhanced. These results suggest that, while lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of inflammatory mediators requires tyrosine kinase activity, tyrosine kinase activity is not obligatory for lipopolysaccharide signal transduction."

Furthermore, binding of short peptides or permanently unfolded proteins to the peptide binding site of HSC70 promotes the dissociation of oligomers into monomers, suggesting that protein substrates are able to compete with HSC70 for the same binding site. Because the release of peptides or unfolded proteins from HSC70 has also been shown to require ATP binding, these results indicate that dissociation of oligomers is controlled by a mechanism similar to that of release of protein substrates and suggest that binding of HSC70 to itself occurs via the peptide binding site and mimics binding of HSC70 to protein substrates.

The new model accounts for ligand association and dissociation, receptor up-regulation, ligand-receptor complex internalization, a change in receptor affinity, and the quenching of internalized fluorescent ligand. We determined that receptor up-regulation is both agonist- and temperature-induced and is inhibited by both phenylarsine oxide and pertussis toxin treatment. Model fits of ligand association to pertussis toxin-treated cells show that while receptor up-regulation was inhibited, rate constants for ligand binding, receptor affinity conversion, and internalization of ligand-receptor complexes were unaffected. Results suggest Gi-protein-mediated receptor up-regulation and Gi-protein-independent receptor affinity conversion. Simulation of ligand infusion using our model gives insight into the quantitative and dynamic relationship between the low affinity ligand-receptor complex and the actin polymerization response."

For example, although ATP and ITP are hydrolyzed by the RecA protein with the same turnover number (18 min−1), ATP (S0.5 = 45 µM) functions as a cofactor for the strand exchange reaction, whereas ITP (S0.5 = 500 µM) is inactive as a strand exchange cofactor. The RecA protein crystal structure suggests that cofactor specificity is determined by Asp100, which likely forms a hydrogen bond with the exocyclic 6-amino group of ATP; the higher S0.5 value for ITP is presumably due to unfavorable interactions between Asp100 and the 6-carbonyl group of the inosine ring.

The RecA protein of Escherichia coli (Mr 37,842, 352 amino acids) is essential for homologous genetic recombination and for the postreplicative repair of damaged DNA. The purified RecA protein will promote a variety of DNA pairing reactions that presumably reflect in vivo recombination functions. The most extensively investigated DNA pairing activity is the ATP-dependent three-strand exchange reaction, in which a circular ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAφXbacteriophage φX174SSBE. coli single-stranded DNA-binding proteinPCRpolymerase chain reactionATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). molecule and a homologous linear dsDNA molecule are recombined to yield a nicked circular dsDNA molecule and a linear ssDNA molecule. This reaction proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, the circular ssDNA substrate is coated with RecA protein to form a presynaptic complex; this complex will catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. In the second phase, the presynaptic complex interacts with a dsDNA molecule, the homologous sequences are brought into register, and pairing between the circular ssDNA and the complementary strand from the dsDNA is initiated. In the third phase, the complementary linear strand is completely transferred to the circular ssDNA by unidirectional branch migration to yield the nicked circular dsDNA and displaced linear ssDNA products (Roca and Cox, 9Roca A.I.

The presynaptic complex formed between RecA protein and ssDNA is the active recombinational entity in the strand exchange reaction. The RecA protein binds cooperatively to ssDNA, forming a right-handed helical protein filament with one RecA monomer per four nucleotides of ssDNA and six RecA monomers per turn of the filament. In the absence of nucleotide cofactor or in the presence of ADP, the helical filament adopts a “collapsed” or “closed” conformation (helical pitch: 65 Å) that is inactive in strand exchange. In the presence of ATP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, however, the filament assumes an “extended” or “open” conformation (helical pitch: 95 Å) that is active in strand exchange (Egelman, 4Egelman E.H.

These studies have shown that a nucleoside triphosphate must have an S0.5 value of 100-120 µM or lower in order to stabilize the strand exchange-active conformation of the RecA-ssDNA complex. For example, although ATP and ITP are hydrolyzed by the RecA protein with identical turnover numbers (18 min−1), ATP (S0.5 = 45 µM) functions as a cofactor for the strand exchange reaction, whereas ITP (S0.5 = 500 µM) is inactive as a strand exchange cofactor. The x-ray crystal structure of the RecA protein-ADP complex indicates that cofactor specificity is determined by Asp100, which forms a hydrogen bond with the exocyclic 6-amino group of adenosine base (Story et al., 12Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar); it seems likely that a similar contact is made with ATP in the RecA-ssDNA-ATP complex (Fig. 1), although no structural information is available for this complex. The higher S0.5 value for ITP, relative to that for ATP, is presumably due to unfavorable interactions between the negatively charged Asp100 side chain and the 6-carbonyl group of the inosine ring. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a mutant RecA protein in which Asp100 was replaced by an asparagine residue. The effect of this mutation on the nucleotide cofactor specificity of the RecA protein is described in this report. Wild-type RecA protein was prepared as described previously (Cotterill et al., 2Cotterill S.M. Satterthwait A.C. Fersht A.R.

[γ-32P]ITP was prepared from IDP using [γ-32P]ATP and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Sigma) as described previously (Menge and Bryant, 8Menge K.L. Bryant F.R.

Circular φX ssDNA ((+)-strand) and circular φX dsDNA were from New England Biolabs; linear φX dsDNA was prepared from circular φX dsDNA as described (Cox and Lehman, 3Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Single- and double-stranded DNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm using the conversion factors 36 and 50 µg/ml/A260, respectively. All DNA concentrations are expressed as total nucleotides. The mutant [D100N]RecA gene was produced by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based overlap extension method essentially as described (Ho et al., 5Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The template for RecA mutagenesis consisted of a pUC19 vector containing a 1300-base pair E. coli DNA fragment carrying the wild-type recA gene and promoter cloned into a BamHI/HindIII site; the mutagenesis primers were 5′-CACGCGCTGCCAATCTACG-3′ and 5′-CGTAGATTGGCAGCGCGTG-3′ (the codon for Asn100 is underlined and the nucleotide mismatch is in bold). The resulting PCR fragment containing the mutant RecA gene and promoter region was cloned into pUC19 to yield the plasmid, pUCrecA(D100N). The entire [D100N]RecA gene and promoter region was sequenced to confirm that only the desired change had been introduced during the mutagenesis procedure. pUCrecA(D100N) was then introduced into the RecA deletion strain, BNN124, and the mutant [D100N]RecA protein was expressed and purified by methods that have been described previously (Bryant, 1Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8716-8723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to reengineer the nucleotide cofactor specificity of the RecA protein, we prepared a new mutant RecA protein in which aspartic acid 100 was replaced by an asparagine residue. The expectation was that the D100N mutation would allow the protein to form hydrogen bonding interactions with the 6-carbonyl group of ITP that are not possible in the wild-type protein (Fig. 1). If the new interactions resulted in a significant decrease in the S0.5 value for ITP, we predicted that the mutation would convert the RecA protein into an ITP-activated DNA recombinase. The purified [D100N]RecA protein is shown in Fig. 2. The ssDNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP and ITP by the wild-type and [D100N]RecA protein was analyzed under standard reaction conditions (pH 7.5, 37°C). The dependence of the rate of ssDNA-dependent NTP hydrolysis on NTP concentration is shown in Fig. 3, and the steady-state kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of each NTP are presented in Table I.Table IKinetic parameters for wild-type and [D100N]RecA protein-catalyzed NTP hydrolysis (pH 7.5)NTPVmax/[Et]S0.5nHmin−1µMWild typeATP18453ITP195003D100NATP18853ITP181253 Open table in a new tab The turnover number (Vmax/[Et]) for ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by the [D100N]RecA protein was 18 min−1, a value identical to that obtained for the wild-type RecA protein. The S0.5(ATP) for the [D100N]RecA protein was 85 µM, approximately 2-fold higher than the value of 45 µM for the wild-type RecA protein. The ATP saturation curves were sigmoidal and identical Hill coefficients (nH) of 3 were obtained for both proteins, indicating that both proteins are subject to positive cooperativity with respect to ATP concentration. These results show that the D100N mutation has a minimal effect on the steady-state kinetics of ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by the RecA protein. The turnover number for ssDNA-dependent ITP hydrolysis by the [D100N]RecA protein was also 18 min−1, a value again equivalent to that obtained for the wild-type protein. Moreover, the ITP saturation curves were sigmoidal and identical Hill coefficients of 3 were obtained for both proteins, indicating that both proteins are subject to positive cooperativity with respect to ITP concentration. However, the S0.5(ITP) for the [D100N]RecA protein was 125 µM compared with a value of 500 µM for the wild-type protein. Thus, the D100N mutation results in a 4-fold decrease in the S0.5(ITP), presumably due to more favorable interactions of the asparagine side chain with the 6-carbonyl group of the inosine ring. The three-strand exchange activity of the [D100N]RecA protein was evaluated under standard reaction conditions (pH 7.5, 37°C). In the three-strand exchange assay, a circular φX ssDNA molecule and a linear φX dsDNA molecule are recombined to form a nicked circular dsDNA molecule and a linear ssDNA molecule; the substrates and products of this reaction are readily monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis (Cox and Lehman, 3Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the wild-type RecA protein has full strand exchange activity in the presence of ATP (3 mM), but has no detectable activity in the presence of ITP (3 mM), consistent with our previous results (Menge and Bryant, 8Menge K.L. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5151-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, the [D100N]RecA protein exhibited full strand exchange activity in the presence of either ATP or ITP (3 mM). Thus, the D100N mutation converts the RecA protein into an ITP-activated DNA recombinase. Our results show that it is possible to alter the nucleoside triphosphate cofactor specificity of the RecA protein by mutating the aspartic acid residue at position 100 of the RecA polypeptide. This finding confirms that the hydrogen bonding interaction between Asp100 and the 6-amino group of the adenosine ring that is apparent in the crystal structure of the RecA-ADP complex (which presumably represents the strand exchange-inactive closed conformation of the protein) also contributes to nucleotide cofactor binding in the strand exchange-active open conformation of the RecA-ssDNA complex."

INTRODUCTIONTranscription reactions in vitro were developed to analyze the synthesis of pre-mRNA from promoter DNA. Reconstitution of transcription with chromatographic fractions has allowed purification of general transcription factors and isolation of the genes encoding the corresponding polypeptides (for review see Refs. 1Buratowski S.

Also identified were activities dispensable for the basal levels of transcription that affected the absolute amounts of product RNA. Initially, activities that suppressed transcription in vitro were largely ignored, but as addition of these activities was shown often to increase the relative response to sequence-specific transcriptional activators, interest in their identity and mechanism grew (4Meisterernst M.

These are collectively referred to as negative cofactors of transcription and are distinct, at least operationally, from silencer element-dependent proteins in that they repress a wide variety of promoters.Several lines of evidence suggest that repression of transcription is a general and important aspect of transcriptional regulation. Both genetic and biochemical experiments suggest that chromatin structure represses transcription (for review see Refs. 7Croston G.E. Kadonaga J.T. Curr. Opin.

Furthermore, studies of SWI/SNF complexes show that controlling the accessibility of chromatin bound promoters to transcription factors is one of the regulatory steps of transcription (9Hirschhorn J.N.

The SRB family of proteins, found as suppressors of C-terminal domain truncation mutations of pol II, are implicated as important components of transcription initiation in vivo (for review see Ref. 18Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Several of SRB genes have been shown to be essential for survival, and in particular the analysis of SRB4 gene suggested a direct involvement in the transcription of most genes (19Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 20Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A conditional loss of function mutation in SRB4 gene can be suppressed by a loss of function mutation in other genes, suggesting the presence of a repression system operating in opposition to the SRB proteins. 2R. Young, personal communication. Chromatographic fractionation of extracts from mammalian cells identified several activities that repress transcription in vitro (4Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G.

Nature. 1993; 365: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Among these negative cofactors of transcription is Dr1 (21Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It was described as a homotetramer of a 19-kDa phosphoprotein capable of forming protein-DNA complexes with TBP and blocking transcription. The inhibition of transcription was not reversible by the addition of any basal factors including TFIIA. Transfection assays indicated that Dr1/p19 can repress transcription in vivo also and may be a target of regulation by upstream activators (22Kraus V.B. Inostroza J.A. Yeung K. Reinberg D. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6279-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Yeung K.C. Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Kannabiran C. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2097-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Specifically, Dr1/p19 repressed pol II promoters generally when expressed in cells by transfection, and this repression was reversed by cotransfection of activators such as VP16 and E1A13S. Additionally, NC2, a negative cofactor with properties similar to Dr1 including its binding to TBP, has been described by Kim et al. to contain Dr1 (24Kim T.K. Zhao Y. Ge H. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of labeled extracts with specific antiserum indicated that Dr1/p19 exists inside the cell in association with several proteins (21Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The activities of complexes containing these proteins have not been characterized.We have purified a 90-kDa transcriptional cofactor consisting of Dr1/p19 and a novel protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa. This report describes the initial characterization of the cofactor complex. The results suggest that it is primarily a negative cofactor with differential effects depending on the identity of the core promoter element. The mechanism of the repression involves formation of complexes with TBP at the promoter, and variations between core promoters were manifest in the presence of TFIIA.DISCUSSIONWe have identified and purified a cofactor of transcription that consists of Dr1/p19 (p20) and a novel protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa (p30). The heteromeric composition of the complex has been suggested by co-association with TBP on the MLP as well as copurification over several chromatographic steps. The heteromeric complex has a molecular mass of 90 kDa and is probably composed of two subunits of Dr1/p19 (p20) and two subunits of p30. The formation of heteromeric structure by Dr1/p19 (p20) and p30 is also supported by their homology to HAP3 and HAP5 proteins, respectively. These two yeast proteins associate into a CAATT binding regulatory complex, and the peptide sequences necessary for their interaction is conserved in the Dr1/p19 (p20) and p30 polypeptides (33McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 35Xing Y. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4647-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 3D. McNabb and L. Guarente, personal communication. Reinberg and co-workers have reported two separate forms of Dr1 (21Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The first form was described as a homotetramer of phosphorylated Dr1/p19 protein with a molecular mass of 90 kDa that elutes in the 0.5 M KCl fraction from a phosphocellulose column. The second form is unphosphorylated and eluted in the 1.0 M KCl fraction from the same column. The 90-kDa factor eluted from a phosphocellulose column in the 0.6 M KCl fraction, and comparison of the mobility with the Dr1 found in the 1.0 M KCl fraction by Western blotting indicated that Dr1/p19 (p20) subunit of the 90-kDa factor was likely phosphorylated (data not shown). In addition, NC2, one of the negative cofactors reported by Roeder and co-workers, has been shown to contain a phosphorylated form of Dr1/p19, although the subunit composition of the purified NC2 and its molecular size have not been described (24Kim T.K. Zhao Y. Ge H. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We suggest that all three factors, the 90-kDa factor, the native Dr1 complex, and NC2 are the same activity and are a heterotetramer of p20 and p30 polypeptides. This proposal is consistent with the repression of transcription and interaction with TBP reported for all three factors.The 90-kDa factor is a repressor of basal transcription. Although it will probably repress transcription from all promoters, the efficiency of repression varies depending on the identity of the core promoter. The mechanism of repression appears to be formation of transcriptionally inert complex with TBP on promoters. An intriguing aspect of transcriptional regulation by the 90-kDa factor is the promoter-specific modulation by TFIIA. In the presence of high levels of TFIIA, transcription from the MLP is refractory to inhibition by the 90-kDa factor. In contrast, under the same condition, transcription from the immunoglobulin µ promoter is strongly inhibited. Correlatable differences between these two promoters were observed in the footprint assays. High levels of TFIIA restored the footprint within the TATA region of the MLP to the TBP-TFIIA-induced pattern from the 90-kDa factor-TBP-induced pattern. In contrast, on the µ promoter, the addition of high levels of TFIIA did not alter the footprint induced by the 90-kDa factor as effectively. Undoubtedly, TFIIA is part of the protein-DNA complex on the MLP in the presence of the 90-kDa factor because it is detectable by supershifting of the complex by anti-TFIIA antibody.Interestingly, the 90-kDa factor and TBP can form a series of extended protein-DNA complexes. Dr1/p19 has been shown to bind to TBP directly. Because the 90-kDa factor is probably a heterotetramer of two Dr1/p19 (p20) subunits and two p30 subunits, each complex is likely bivalent for binding to TBP. Furthermore, the purified Dr1/p19 (p20) subunit oligomerizes into a tetramer when prepared separately from p30 (21Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), indicating the potential to form higher order structures of the 90-kDa factor under appropriate conditions. Also of interest, both Dr1 and p30 is distantly related to histone proteins through the so-called histone fold motif, a feature found among proteins that make protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts (36Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, the oligomerization of the 90-kDa factor is likely a reflection of its innate structural features and important for its function in vivo. The formation of the more extended protein-DNA complex is nucleated by TBP binding to TATA element and subsequent binding of the 90-kDa factor. The addition of higher amounts of TBP results in the formation of a complex that migrates slowly during the gel electrophoresis and has an extended footprint spanning over 150 base pairs of the probe. Thus, most likely, this complex is composed of multiple 90-kDa factors and TBPs, and the promoter is inaccessible to the other basal factors necessary to mediate transcription. It should be noted, however, that formation of the more extended structure is probably not required for the inhibition of transcription by the 90-kDa factor or for the promoter-specific derepession by TFIIA, because both phenomena occur at low levels of TBP as well.Promoter specificity for the activities of TFIIA factor has not been previously described. This specificity was only apparent under conditions of excess TBP where complexes of this protein bound to DNA competed for other basal factors necessary for initiation. This suggests that different combinations of TBP, TFIIA, and promoter DNA have varying affinities for other factors such as TFIIB, TFIIF, and pol II. As discussed above, the combined activities of the 90-kDa factor and TFIIA were more dramatically promoter-specific than either factor alone. This specificity could be observed at both low and high TBP concentrations. It is interesting to speculate that DNA bound TBP complexes might compete for basal factors such as the holopolymerase II in vivo. If this were the case, then the promoter specificity detected in this study might be more relevant to conditions in vivo than the typical reaction using limiting concentrations of TBP.It is now well accepted that the regulation of pol II transcription involves negative modulation of basal and activated transcription. The 90-kDa factor is probably one of these negative components and suppresses transcription in vivo as well as in vitro. Cotransfection assays indicate that an overexpression of Dr1/p19 subunit represses transcription in vivo, and a subset of activation domains including VP16 and E1A-CR3 can derepress transcription (22Kraus V.B. Inostroza J.A. Yeung K. Reinberg D. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6279-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Yeung K.C. Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Kannabiran C. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2097-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Comparison of sequences of the p30 subunit of the 90-kDa factor allowed identification of a related protein from S. cerevisiae encoded by the YER159c gene. A mutation in YER159c can suppress a conditional loss of function mutation in SRB4, a component of the yeast pol II holoenzyme complex (20Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).2 Shifting the SRB4 mutant strain to restrictive temperature results in rapid cessation of mRNA synthesis from many pol II promoters, indicating that SRB4 is an important component of transcriptional activation (20Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). That a mutation in the p30 homologue suppresses the loss of function mutation of SRB4 is consistent with the proposal that the p30 homologue is a component of a general repressor activity such as the 90-kDa factor. Furthermore, the results presented here indicate that transcriptional regulation by the repressor 90-kDa factor may have a measure of promoter specificity dictated by the content of the core promoter and the flanking sequences.

The results suggest that it is primarily a negative cofactor with differential effects depending on the identity of the core promoter element. The mechanism of the repression involves formation of complexes with TBP at the promoter, and variations between core promoters were manifest in the presence of TFIIA. Transcription reactions in vitro were developed to analyze the synthesis of pre-mRNA from promoter DNA. Reconstitution of transcription with chromatographic fractions has allowed purification of general transcription factors and isolation of the genes encoding the corresponding polypeptides (for review see Refs. 1Buratowski S.

Also identified were activities dispensable for the basal levels of transcription that affected the absolute amounts of product RNA. Initially, activities that suppressed transcription in vitro were largely ignored, but as addition of these activities was shown often to increase the relative response to sequence-specific transcriptional activators, interest in their identity and mechanism grew (4Meisterernst M.

These are collectively referred to as negative cofactors of transcription and are distinct, at least operationally, from silencer element-dependent proteins in that they repress a wide variety of promoters. Several lines of evidence suggest that repression of transcription is a general and important aspect of transcriptional regulation. Both genetic and biochemical experiments suggest that chromatin structure represses transcription (for review see Refs. 7Croston G.E. Kadonaga J.T. Curr. Opin.

Furthermore, studies of SWI/SNF complexes show that controlling the accessibility of chromatin bound promoters to transcription factors is one of the regulatory steps of transcription (9Hirschhorn J.N.

The SRB family of proteins, found as suppressors of C-terminal domain truncation mutations of pol II, are implicated as important components of transcription initiation in vivo (for review see Ref. 18Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Several of SRB genes have been shown to be essential for survival, and in particular the analysis of SRB4 gene suggested a direct involvement in the transcription of most genes (19Thompson C.M.

Chromatographic fractionation of extracts from mammalian cells identified several activities that repress transcription in vitro (4Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G.

Nature. 1993; 365: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Among these negative cofactors of transcription is Dr1 (21Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It was described as a homotetramer of a 19-kDa phosphoprotein capable of forming protein-DNA complexes with TBP and blocking transcription. The inhibition of transcription was not reversible by the addition of any basal factors including TFIIA. Transfection assays indicated that Dr1/p19 can repress transcription in vivo also and may be a target of regulation by upstream activators (22Kraus V.B. Inostroza J.A. Yeung K. Reinberg D. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6279-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Yeung K.C. Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Kannabiran C. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2097-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Specifically, Dr1/p19 repressed pol II promoters generally when expressed in cells by transfection, and this repression was reversed by cotransfection of activators such as VP16 and E1A13S. Additionally, NC2, a negative cofactor with properties similar to Dr1 including its binding to TBP, has been described by Kim et al. to contain Dr1 (24Kim T.K. Zhao Y. Ge H. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of labeled extracts with specific antiserum indicated that Dr1/p19 exists inside the cell in association with several proteins (21Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The activities of complexes containing these proteins have not been characterized. We have purified a 90-kDa transcriptional cofactor consisting of Dr1/p19 and a novel protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa. This report describes the initial characterization of the cofactor complex. The results suggest that it is primarily a negative cofactor with differential effects depending on the identity of the core promoter element. The mechanism of the repression involves formation of complexes with TBP at the promoter, and variations between core promoters were manifest in the presence of TFIIA. DISCUSSIONWe have identified and purified a cofactor of transcription that consists of Dr1/p19 (p20) and a novel protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa (p30). The heteromeric composition of the complex has been suggested by co-association with TBP on the MLP as well as copurification over several chromatographic steps. The heteromeric complex has a molecular mass of 90 kDa and is probably composed of two subunits of Dr1/p19 (p20) and two subunits of p30. The formation of heteromeric structure by Dr1/p19 (p20) and p30 is also supported by their homology to HAP3 and HAP5 proteins, respectively. These two yeast proteins associate into a CAATT binding regulatory complex, and the peptide sequences necessary for their interaction is conserved in the Dr1/p19 (p20) and p30 polypeptides (33McNabb D.S. Xing Y. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 35Xing Y. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4647-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 3D. McNabb and L. Guarente, personal communication. Reinberg and co-workers have reported two separate forms of Dr1 (21Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The first form was described as a homotetramer of phosphorylated Dr1/p19 protein with a molecular mass of 90 kDa that elutes in the 0.5 M KCl fraction from a phosphocellulose column. The second form is unphosphorylated and eluted in the 1.0 M KCl fraction from the same column. The 90-kDa factor eluted from a phosphocellulose column in the 0.6 M KCl fraction, and comparison of the mobility with the Dr1 found in the 1.0 M KCl fraction by Western blotting indicated that Dr1/p19 (p20) subunit of the 90-kDa factor was likely phosphorylated (data not shown). In addition, NC2, one of the negative cofactors reported by Roeder and co-workers, has been shown to contain a phosphorylated form of Dr1/p19, although the subunit composition of the purified NC2 and its molecular size have not been described (24Kim T.K. Zhao Y. Ge H. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We suggest that all three factors, the 90-kDa factor, the native Dr1 complex, and NC2 are the same activity and are a heterotetramer of p20 and p30 polypeptides. This proposal is consistent with the repression of transcription and interaction with TBP reported for all three factors.The 90-kDa factor is a repressor of basal transcription. Although it will probably repress transcription from all promoters, the efficiency of repression varies depending on the identity of the core promoter. The mechanism of repression appears to be formation of transcriptionally inert complex with TBP on promoters. An intriguing aspect of transcriptional regulation by the 90-kDa factor is the promoter-specific modulation by TFIIA. In the presence of high levels of TFIIA, transcription from the MLP is refractory to inhibition by the 90-kDa factor. In contrast, under the same condition, transcription from the immunoglobulin µ promoter is strongly inhibited. Correlatable differences between these two promoters were observed in the footprint assays. High levels of TFIIA restored the footprint within the TATA region of the MLP to the TBP-TFIIA-induced pattern from the 90-kDa factor-TBP-induced pattern. In contrast, on the µ promoter, the addition of high levels of TFIIA did not alter the footprint induced by the 90-kDa factor as effectively. Undoubtedly, TFIIA is part of the protein-DNA complex on the MLP in the presence of the 90-kDa factor because it is detectable by supershifting of the complex by anti-TFIIA antibody.Interestingly, the 90-kDa factor and TBP can form a series of extended protein-DNA complexes. Dr1/p19 has been shown to bind to TBP directly. Because the 90-kDa factor is probably a heterotetramer of two Dr1/p19 (p20) subunits and two p30 subunits, each complex is likely bivalent for binding to TBP. Furthermore, the purified Dr1/p19 (p20) subunit oligomerizes into a tetramer when prepared separately from p30 (21Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), indicating the potential to form higher order structures of the 90-kDa factor under appropriate conditions. Also of interest, both Dr1 and p30 is distantly related to histone proteins through the so-called histone fold motif, a feature found among proteins that make protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts (36Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, the oligomerization of the 90-kDa factor is likely a reflection of its innate structural features and important for its function in vivo. The formation of the more extended protein-DNA complex is nucleated by TBP binding to TATA element and subsequent binding of the 90-kDa factor. The addition of higher amounts of TBP results in the formation of a complex that migrates slowly during the gel electrophoresis and has an extended footprint spanning over 150 base pairs of the probe. Thus, most likely, this complex is composed of multiple 90-kDa factors and TBPs, and the promoter is inaccessible to the other basal factors necessary to mediate transcription. It should be noted, however, that formation of the more extended structure is probably not required for the inhibition of transcription by the 90-kDa factor or for the promoter-specific derepession by TFIIA, because both phenomena occur at low levels of TBP as well.Promoter specificity for the activities of TFIIA factor has not been previously described. This specificity was only apparent under conditions of excess TBP where complexes of this protein bound to DNA competed for other basal factors necessary for initiation. This suggests that different combinations of TBP, TFIIA, and promoter DNA have varying affinities for other factors such as TFIIB, TFIIF, and pol II. As discussed above, the combined activities of the 90-kDa factor and TFIIA were more dramatically promoter-specific than either factor alone. This specificity could be observed at both low and high TBP concentrations. It is interesting to speculate that DNA bound TBP complexes might compete for basal factors such as the holopolymerase II in vivo. If this were the case, then the promoter specificity detected in this study might be more relevant to conditions in vivo than the typical reaction using limiting concentrations of TBP.It is now well accepted that the regulation of pol II transcription involves negative modulation of basal and activated transcription. The 90-kDa factor is probably one of these negative components and suppresses transcription in vivo as well as in vitro. Cotransfection assays indicate that an overexpression of Dr1/p19 subunit represses transcription in vivo, and a subset of activation domains including VP16 and E1A-CR3 can derepress transcription (22Kraus V.B.

Kannabiran C. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2097-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Comparison of sequences of the p30 subunit of the 90-kDa factor allowed identification of a related protein from S. cerevisiae encoded by the YER159c gene. A mutation in YER159c can suppress a conditional loss of function mutation in SRB4, a component of the yeast pol II holoenzyme complex (20Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).2 Shifting the SRB4 mutant strain to restrictive temperature results in rapid cessation of mRNA synthesis from many pol II promoters, indicating that SRB4 is an important component of transcriptional activation (20Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). That a mutation in the p30 homologue suppresses the loss of function mutation of SRB4 is consistent with the proposal that the p30 homologue is a component of a general repressor activity such as the 90-kDa factor. Furthermore, the results presented here indicate that transcriptional regulation by the repressor 90-kDa factor may have a measure of promoter specificity dictated by the content of the core promoter and the flanking sequences. We have identified and purified a cofactor of transcription that consists of Dr1/p19 (p20) and a novel protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa (p30).

Sodium channels are composed of about 2000 amino acids organized in four repeated homologous domains (I-IV) each consisting of six putative transmembrane segments (S1-S6) (4Catterall W.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 72 (suppl.): 15-48Google Scholar). Partial localization of receptor site 5 has been suggested recently, using photolabeled derivative of PbTx-3 and site-directed antibody mapping, to be in the region of interaction of transmembrane segments S6 and S5 of homology domains I and IV, respectively, of rat brain sodium channels (5Trainer V.L.

Since 1981, the binding of different brevetoxins and the allosteric interaction between receptor site 5 and other neurotoxins' receptors on sodium channels have been extensively studied using neuroblastoma cells and rat brain synaptosomes (6Catterall W.A.

Scorpion α-toxins were shown to inhibit inactivation of sodium channels, and their binding was demonstrated to be allosterically enhanced by alkaloid toxins (such as batrachotoxin and veratridine) (4Catterall W.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 72 (suppl.): 15-48Google Scholar) but not by brevetoxins. PbTx-1 and PbTx-2 were shown not to affect the binding of the scorpion α-toxin Lqq V (6Catterall W.A. Risk M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 19: 345-348PubMed Google Scholar, 7Catterall W.A. Gainer M. Toxicon. 1985; 23: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Sharkey R.G. Jover E. Couraud F. Baden D.G. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 273-278PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the previous results, we have recently demonstrated that PbTx-1, the most active brevetoxin analog (1Baden D.G. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1807-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), induces a strong negative allosteric modulation on the binding of another scorpion α-toxin, AaH II, on rat brain sodium channels (14Cestèle S. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of AaH II to rat brain synaptosomes was shown to be the highest among all scorpion α-toxins (Kd = 0.2-0.3 nM) (14Cestèle S. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Jover E. Martin-Moutot N. Couraud F. Rochat H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), about 10-fold higher than that of Lqq V (Kd = 2.2-8 nM) (16Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7307-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural differences between these two pharmacologically similar scorpion α-toxins, both inhibiting sodium channel inactivation and binding to receptor site 3 in a voltage-dependent manner on mammalian sodium channels (15Jover E. Martin-Moutot N. Couraud F. Rochat H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1977; 252: 8660-8668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may account for the significant difference in binding affinity. In addition, the various brevetoxins were shown to have different toxicity and differentially affect the binding of [3H]batrachotoxin derivative (1Baden D.G. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1807-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 11Trainer V.L. Moreau E. Guedin D. Baden D.G. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

These considerations led us to attribute the differences between ours and preceding results concerning the previously undetectable strong allosteric modulation by PbTx-1 on the scorpion α-toxin binding to: 1) structural differences between the two scorpion α-toxins used, AaH II in our case and Lqq V in the others, suggesting that interaction between brevetoxin and scorpion α-toxin site may be, at least in part, toxin specific; and 2) the inherent structural differences in the brevetoxin analogs (1Baden D.G. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1807-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 12Gawley R.E. Rein K.S. Kinoshita M. Baden D.G. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) used in ours and previous studies (14Cestèle S. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present work we examined these possibilities and found that none can account for the observed discrepancy, suggesting that still other, unexpected reasons should exist. We found that the routine presence of TTX may account for that discrepancy. Scorpion toxins AaH II and Lqq V were purified as described previously (27Miranda F. Kopeyan C. Rochat H. Rochat C. Lissitzky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Brevetoxins (PbTx-1, −2, −3, and −9) and tetrodotoxin were from Latoxan (Rosans, France). Carrier-free Na125I was from Amersham Corp. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Filters for binding assays were glass fiber GF/C (Whatman, United Kingdom) preincubated in 0.3% polyethyleneimine (Sigma). Rat brain synaptosomes were prepared from adult albino Wistar rats (about 300 g, laboratory bred), according to Ref. 26Dodd P.R. Hardy J.A. Oakley A.E. Edwardson J.A. Perry E.K. Delaunoy J.P. Brain Res. 1981; 226: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar. All buffers contained a mixture of proteinase inhibitors composed of 50 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µM pepstatin A, 1 mM iodoacetamide, and 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline. Membrane protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin as standard. AaH II and Lqq V were radioiodinated by lactoperoxidase and monoiodotoxins were purified as described previously (14Cestèle S. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The concentration of the radiolabeled toxins was determined according to the specific activity of the 125I corresponding to 2424 dpm/fmol monoiodotoxin. Equilibrium competition and saturation assays were performed using increasing concentrations of the unlabeled toxin in the presence of a constant low concentration of the radioactive toxin. Standard binding medium composition was: (in mM): choline chloride 140, CaCl2 1.8, KCl 5.4, MgSO4 0.8, HEPES 25, glucose 10, bovine serum albumin 2 mg/ml, pH 7.4. Wash buffer composition was (in mM): choline chloride 140, CaCl2 1.8, KCl 5.4, MgSO4 0.8, HEPES 25, bovine serum albumin 5 mg/ml, pH 7.4. Rat brain synaptosomes (0.1-0.15 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in 0.15 ml of binding buffer, containing 125I-AaH II or 125I-Lqq V. After incubation for 30 min at 37°C, the reaction mixture was diluted with 2 ml of ice-cold wash buffer and filtered through GF/C under vacuum. Filters were rapidly washed with an additional 2 × 2 ml of buffer. Nonspecific toxin binding was determined in the presence of 0.2 µM unlabeled AaH II or 1.6 µM Lqq V, respectively, and consist typically of 15-20% of total binding for 125I-AaH II or 30-40% for 125I-Lqq V. Equilibrium saturation or competition experiments were analyzed by the iterative computer program LIGAND (Elsevier Biosoft). Each experiment was performed at least three times. We have shown previously that brevetoxin (PbTx-1) inhibition on AaH II binding results from a 3.6-fold reduction in AaH II binding affinity (with no significant effect on receptor capacity), due to increasing the dissociation rate constant, consistent with a negative allosteric interaction between brevetoxin receptor site 5 and scorpion α-toxin receptor site 3 (14Cestèle S. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that both Lqq V and AaH II binding are significantly inhibited by PbTx-1. Lqq V-specific binding is similarly inhibited, but at apparent higher PbTx-1 concentration (Fig. 1). This result excluded the explanation in possibility 1 (see Introduction), since both scorpion α-toxins binding is shown to be negatively modulated by brevetoxin, although with some quantitative differences. Different brevetoxin analogs, PbTx-1, PbTx-2, PbTx-3 and PbTx-9, are shown in Fig. 2 to inhibit both scorpion α-toxins binding; PbTx-1 being the most active one. As suggested in Fig. 1, the binding inhibition of the two toxins revealed significant quantitative differences (Fig. 2). To reveal possible structural basis for the above quantitative differences, we compared structural models of the two scorpion α-toxins. AaH II and Lqq V share 63% of amino acid identity (72% similarity). Computer modeling discloses that the positively charged residues, previously suggested to participate in the receptor binding interaction (18Kharrat R. Darbon H. Rochat H. Granier C. Eur J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Kharrat R. Darbon H. Granier C. Rochat H. Toxicon. 1990; 28: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) are differentially located on the toxins' surface (data not shown). The presence of Lys-60 in Lqq V as well as the shift in position of arginine 54 of Lqq V as compared to arginine 56 in AaH II, suggested to be exposed on the active surface of the toxins, may contribute to the quantitative differences in toxin's binding modulation by brevetoxins. The recent identification of a negatively charged residue on sodium channels, which forms one of the recognition sites of scorpion α-toxin receptor site 3 on homology domain IV of sodium channel (20Rogers J.C. Ou Y. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A Biophys. J. Abstr. 1996; 70 (abstr.): A319Google Scholar), supports this notion. Thus, although the structural differences between the two toxins may contribute to the observed quantitative differences, they cannot account for the discrepancy between our results and the previous one. Careful inspection of the former binding conditions revealed that TTX was routinely added to binding media used for scorpion α-toxin binding modulation. TTX is most commonly used as specific blocker of sodium current in many studies and has been considered to plug the channel pore from the extracellular side, without any significant alteration of the sodium channel structure (21Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 15-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 22Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 953-986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the possible effect of TTX on the allosteric modulation of scorpion α-toxin binding by brevetoxin. Surprisingly, our results (Fig. 3) elucidate an unexpected increase in AaH II binding by TTX, which is further enhanced by brevetoxin, despite the inhibitory effect of brevetoxin alone. As has been demonstrated previously (15Jover E. Martin-Moutot N. Couraud F. Rochat H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7307-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TTX alone increases α-scorpion binding (Fig. 3A) due to about 1.3-fold increase in the number of receptor sites with no change in affinity (16Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7307-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that TTX is able to abolish the inhibitory effect of PbTx-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. At 1 µM TTX, the concentration routinely used previously in the binding media (6Catterall W.A. Risk M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 19: 345-348PubMed Google Scholar, 7Catterall W.A. Gainer M. Toxicon. 1985; 23: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Sharkey R.G. Jover E. Couraud F. Baden D.G. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 273-278PubMed Google Scholar), no significant effect of brevetoxin may be detected on the scorpion α-toxin binding. This indicates that TTX induces a conformational change on the sodium channel, resulting in reversing the negative allosteric modulation by PbTx-1 on scorpion α-toxin binding. Moreover, the increase in AaH II binding by TTX is enhanced by brevetoxin. This enhancement may not be explained by an additive effect. In the presence of brevetoxin, TTX increases AaH II binding by about 2-fold, as compared to about 1.3-fold increase by TTX alone (Fig. 3A). The enhancement of AaH II binding by TTX (with or without brevetoxin) is evident only at the resting membrane potential; at depolarized conditions (by high external potassium concentration; Ref. 16Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7307-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TTX is not able to negate the decrease in scorpion α-toxin binding (data not shown). Scatchard analysis of AaH II binding reveals that the reversal of brevetoxin's negative effect on scorpion α-toxin binding by TTX is due to a 2-fold increase in AaH II binding affinity (Fig. 3B). Brevetoxin at half saturating concentration (30 nM) increases the Kd of AaH II about 2-fold, in accordance with our previous results (14Cestèle S. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the presence of TTX decreases the Kd back to its original value. Thus, in the presence of both TTX and PbTx-1, the binding affinity of AaH II is about its value with no effectors (Fig. 3B; Ref. 14Cestèle S. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that TTX in the presence of brevetoxin induces an allosteric effect on receptor site 3 that reverses or prevents the decrease in affinity induced by brevetoxin alone, resulting in scorpion α-toxin binding around control level. Our results indicate that TTX, the most used and studied sodium channels blocker, should be considered as an allosteric modifier of sodium channels, and new allosteric interactions are elucidated between receptor sites 1, 5, and 3, using scorpion α-toxin as probe. The increase in scorpion α-toxin binding by TTX (15Jover E. Martin-Moutot N. Couraud F. Rochat H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 16Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7307-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 3) has been attributed previously to its block of sodium channel conductance and prevention of possible depolarization (known to reduce the scorpion α-toxins binding, 21, 22). In contrast to previous interpretations (15Jover E. Martin-Moutot N. Couraud F. Rochat H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7307-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest that this enhancement may be attributed to a direct allosteric effect of TTX on receptor site 3, resulting in shifting more receptors to the high affinity state for scorpion α-toxin, since all experiments have been performed in sodium-free media (15Jover E. Martin-Moutot N. Couraud F. Rochat H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 16Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7307-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 3). The reversal of brevetoxin inhibition by TTX further supports its allosteric effect on receptor site 3. These results indicate also the presence of allosteric interaction between TTX and brevetoxin receptor site, that are mainly detected at the region of scorpion α-toxin receptor site. Previously, enhancement of [3H]saxitoxin binding by brevetoxin was reported in neuroblastoma cells (6Catterall W.A. Risk M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 19: 345-348PubMed Google Scholar) but not in rat brain synaptosomes (9Sharkey R.G. Jover E. Couraud F. Baden D.G. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 273-278PubMed Google Scholar). Tritiated brevetoxin binding was slightly enhanced (5-10%) in the presence of higher concentrations of saxitoxin or TTX (8Poli M.A. Mende T.J. Baden D.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 129-135PubMed Google Scholar). Together, previous and present results suggest the presence of allosteric interactions between TTX and brevetoxin receptor sites. However, such interaction may result in very limited conformational changes, as detected by the limited changes in binding at receptor sites 1 and 5. Our present results may indicate that the binding of TTX and brevetoxin to their distinct receptor sites may induce additional, previously undetectable conformational changes on the sodium channel protein. Such conformational changes could not been detected by the study of TTX and PbTx-1 alone, suggesting that they may not be directly related to the function of each toxin. Rather, other conformational changes resulting from the binding of these toxins, may be detected using scorpion α-toxin as sensitive probe for subtle conformational alterations in a different region comprising receptor site 3 on sodium channels. The significant reversal of brevetoxin-induced binding inhibition of AaH II by TTX is comparable with that previously observed by veratridine (14Cestèle S. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both sodium channel effectors (TTX and veratridine) could enhance the scorpion α-toxin binding more efficiently in the presence of the negative modulator, PbTx-1 (Fig. 3; Ref. 14Cestèle S. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Brevetoxins have been shown to allosterically enhance the binding of alkaloid toxins (9Sharkey R.G. Jover E. Couraud F. Baden D.G. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 273-278PubMed Google Scholar, 11Trainer V.L. Moreau E. Guedin D. Baden D.G. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17114-17119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that allosteric interactions between TTX and PbTx-1 receptor sites are also present, but expressed more significantly in an indirect conformational changes sensed by scorpion α-toxin binding. These may suggest an intimate dynamic relationship between at least some recognition sites comprising receptor site 3 and those of receptor sites 1 and 5. This study may pave the way to a new insight into the dynamic conformational changes induced on the channel protein upon neurotoxin binding and action, revealing dynamic relationship between the pore region (receptor site 1) (23Noda M.

https://openalex.org/W1969627517,"Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an essential enzyme of DNA metabolism. We have carried out an extensive insertional mutagenesis of the Escherichia coli TS gene (thyA) using three different methods. Insertion of exogenous sequences at unique restriction sites or at random positions produced defective mutants, whereas comparison of TS sequences from different species allowed us to identify six zones permissive for insertions of exogenous sequences. The insertion of Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease substrate sequences into the permissive sites converted TS to an HIV-1 protease substrate, and the in vivo cleavage of these insertions by the cloned HIV-1 protease conferred a thymidylate synthase-deficient phenotype in some of our E. coli mutant strains. In agreement with crystallographic data, these results show that the permissive sites are located in regions of the TS protein not essential for enzyme activity and accessible to cleavage by HIV protease. These results also show that it is possible to control a growth phenotype in E. coli through the protease-mediated destruction of an essential metabolic enzyme. Because both wild type and thymidylate synthase-deficient phenotypes are selectable on the appropriate growth medium, these thyA mutants could be used for genetic selections of protease inhibitors and analysis of protease specificities."

Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), they typically are characterized by an α helical hydrophobic sequence bounded on its amino-terminal side by at least one positively charged residue (1von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). At least three paths into or across the thylakoid membrane have been described (3Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Robinson C. Klosgen R.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and these can sometimes be distinguished by the type of signal sequence (6Henry R. Kapazoglou A. McCaffery M. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10189-10192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmically synthesized proteins destined for the thylakoid are imported across the chloroplast envelope and then the amino-terminal region of the signal is removed by a chloroplast stromal protease (7Howe G. Merchant S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1862-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The remaining portion of the signal then directs the protein into or across the thylakoid (8Smeekens S. Bauerle C. Hageman J. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P. Cell. 1986; 46: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For lumenal proteins such as those of the oxygen evolving complex and plastocyanin this signal is removed from the amino terminus within the lumen (8Smeekens S. Bauerle C. Hageman J. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P. Cell. 1986; 46: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The integral thylakoid membrane light harvesting chlorophyll protein has an internal, complex signal that is distributed throughout its three hydrophobic α-helices (9Auchincloss A.H. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chloroplast-encoded proteins, such as cytochrome f, also target to the thylakoid with an amino-terminal signal, although some of these are not cleaved after translocation (10Willey D.L. Auffret A.D. Gray J.C. Cell. 1984; 36: 555-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis indicates it is likely that both chloroplast and cytoplasmically synthesized proteins can use common translocation mechanisms (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our studies also show that proteins passing completely through the thylakoid membrane utilize a different path from those that become integral proteins (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments that study competition between various precursors and chimeric signal sequences (3Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and that describe the energetics of protein translocation (11Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), distinguish at least three paths (12Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K.

Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17664-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Distinct pathways are indicated by these studies, but the possibility of common components cannot be ruled out; there may be multiple pathways into one (or two) common membrane translocases. Mutations in signal sequences can lead to a loss of translocation, and a number of successful genetic selections have identified suppressors of bacterial signal mutations (16Bieker K.L. Silhavy T.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 833-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Bieker K.L. Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These extragenic suppressor mutations usually lie in proteins that interact with the mutant signal sequence, and the characterization of these suppressors has been an efficient way of identifying components of the membrane and cytoplasmic translocation machineries. We have used a genetic approach to characterize the translocation of cytochrome f, a chloroplast-encoded protein that spans the thylakoid membrane once (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Willey D.L. Auffret A.D. Gray J.C. Cell. 1984; 36: 555-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cytochrome f is a member of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, and as such is required for photosynthesis. Mutations in the hydrophobic core of the Chlamydomonas cytochrome f presequence inhibit the ability of cells to grow photosynthetically and by selecting for the restoration of photosynthetic growth, nuclear and chloroplast suppressors were isolated. We describe here the characterization of the chloroplast suppressor mutations and show that they lie within the cytochrome f signal sequence. We also demonstrate the necessity for a hydrophobic core, but not amino-terminal charged residues in the signal sequence for cytochrome f translocation. Chlamydomonas DNA was extracted using the rapid whole cell DNA isolation procedure (18Newman S.M. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Randolph-Anderson B.L. Johnson A.M. Harris E.H. Genetics. 1990; 126: 875-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty rounds of amplification were performed with 1 to 5 µl of DNA preparation, 0.2 mM dNTP, 1 × reaction buffer, 1 µM primer petA2 (nucleotides −88 to −67), 5′-cgaactggaatccccttatag-3′, 1 µM primer petA221 (nucleotides 221 to 241) 5′-caatacgaccattagcctcac-3′, 2.5 units of Taq (Boehringer) in 40 µl final volume. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified by precipitation with 50% isopropyl alcohol and 1 M ammonium acetate. The amplified sequence was determined using the dsDNA Cycle Sequencing System (Life Technologies, Inc.) using petA2 as the end labeled primer. The double mutant R10L/V16D was made by introducing the R10L mutation into the V16D mutant plasmid (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis kit from Amersham Corp. The R10L mutation was made by creating the following nucleotide changes, 27-30 GCTG, where nucleotide 1 is the site of cytochrome f translation initiation (19Buschlen S. Choquet Y. Kuras R. Wollman F-A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The triple mutant R10L/A12E/V16D was made by introducing the A12E substitution into the double mutant R10L/V16D petA (cytochrome f gene), using oligonucleotide mutagenesis. The following nucleotide changes were made: R10L, nucleotides 27-30 GCTG; A12E, nucleotides 33-36 TGAG; V16D, 45-47 AGA. Each of the mutant genes was identified in Escherichia coli using colony hybridization to mutant oligonucleotides (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and plasmids were sequenced using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) to verify the existence of the mutation. cc-125 was as described (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989Google Scholar, 22Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 510-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The R10L/V16D and R10L/A12E/V16D Chlamydomonas mutants were identified by Southern analysis as described (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with the following modification. The R10L/V16D mutant was identified by hybridization with a R10L/V16D oligonucleotide. The R10L/A12E/V16D mutant was screened by hybridization with a R10L/A12E/V16D oligonucleotide. The temperature of washes at which the mutant oligonucleotide remain hybridized to the mutant DNA but not to wild type was 78°C for R10L/V16D and 74°C for R10L/A12E/V16D. Growth of strains was determined on acetate containing TAP medium and on minimal HS medium (21Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989Google Scholar). Strains were grown in liquid TAP and then equal numbers of cells were spotted onto plates and grown under low light (15 µmol of photons/m2 s) or high light (200 µmol of photons/m2 s) for 5 days. Northern analysis (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Zarlenga D.S. Gamble H.R. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was quantified from 4 replicates using non-saturated signals and a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and software. The signal sequence of cytochrome f contains a charged residue arginine (R) followed by 8 hydrophobic amino acids in a postulated α-helix followed by a glycine (G), α-helix breaking residue (Fig. 1). In a previous work (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated that mutant strains containing substitutions A15E or V16D (first letter indicates the wild-type amino acid at the numbered position, and the second letter, the mutant residue) showed reduced or no photoautotrophic growth, respectively, as assayed by their inability to grow in the light in the absence of added carbon (no acetate, HS media). Western and pulse-chase analysis revealed that these mutations blocked the translocation of cytochrome f into the thylakoid membrane. A15E and V16D strains were subjected to methanesulfonic acid ethyl ester mutagenesis and suppressors were selected for the ability to restore the cells to photosynthetic growth by plating 108 cells on HS (nonacetate containing media which selects for photosynthetic growth) in light greater than 200 µmol of photons/m2 s (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One hundred and twenty A15E suppressors, and two V16D suppressors were obtained. Multiple variations of growth conditions and alternative mutagens (such as UV) were tried but no additional suppressors were obtained (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the absence of methanesulfonic acid ethyl ester treatment no suppressors were detected in over 109 cells. Crosses of both V16D suppressor strains, and two of the A15E suppressor strains (all mating type +) with a wild-type mating type − strain produced progeny that all grew photosynthetically. Because the chloroplast genome, and thus the V16D and A15E mutations, are predominately inherited from the mating type + strain (21Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989Google Scholar), we concluded that these four strains carried chloroplastic suppressor mutations. The remaining 118 A15E suppressors strains tested carry nuclear suppressors. These loci are referred to as tip (thylakoid insertion protein) mutants and will be described elsewhere. To determine the nature of the chloroplast suppressors of A15E and V16D, the cytochrome f signal peptide coding sequence from each of the four strains was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced (data not shown). In both V16D suppressor strains the codon for Arg-10 (cgc) was changed to encode a Leu (ctc), and in both A15E suppressing strains, Arg-10 was changed to Cys (tgc, Fig. 1). No other changes in the signal sequence were found. Reversions of the original mutation were not found, which was expected as the initial mutations involved three base alterations for A15E and two base alterations for V16D. To determine that the suppression of V16D was due only to the Arg-10 substitutions and not to some other additional mutation in the chloroplast genome, we synthesized in vitro the double mutant R10L/V16D and transformed this gene into a wild-type Chlamydomonas using particle gun bombardment and homologous recombination in the chloroplast genome (24Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Hosler J.P. Johnson A.M. Jones A.R. Randolph-Anderson B.L. Robertson D. Klein T.M. Shark K.B. Sanford J.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Initial transformation was scored by co-transformation with a spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance (sprstr) marker in the chloroplast rRNA gene (24Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Hosler J.P. Johnson A.M. Jones A.R. Randolph-Anderson B.L. Robertson D. Klein T.M. Shark K.B. Sanford J.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Through multiple subculturing (single cell cloning) and selection of sprstr in these transformed lines, all ~70 copies of petA (cytochrome f gene) can be replaced, and this occurs through random segregation and selection for sprstr. Strains were propagated non-photosynthetically on TAP media. The presence of only mutant and no wild-type gene copies was detected using mutant or wild-type oligonucleotides and Southern blotting of total cell DNA. Fig. 2 shows that the labeled mutant oligonucleotide R10L/V16D hybridizes only to DNA isolated from the mutant strains, and not the wild type. No wild type cytochrome f signal sequences are present in the DNA isolated from the R10L/V16D strain. The strains carrying the double mutation R10L/V16D were then tested for growth in the absence of acetate as an indication of their ability to translocate cytochrome f. Fig. 3 shows that the V16D strain cannot grow photosynthetically on HS media, and A15E has 10% the amount of photosynthetic growth of wild type (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both of the strains carrying the selected chloroplast suppressors of A15E and V16D (V16Dsup and A15Esup, Fig. 3), and the in vitro engineered double mutant strain (R10L/V16D) grow on HS. Thus the R10L substitution alone is sufficient to suppress the V16D mutation. Fig. 3 demonstrates that each of these strains can grow heterotrophically on TAP medium, which contains acetate, but different heterotrophic growth rates are seen, especially for V16D. The reasons for this reduced growth are not known, although effects on non-photosynthetic growth have been seen for a variety of other mutants that affect chloroplast function (21Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were made from each strain, run in a denaturing acrylamide gel, and the Western blot was probed with anti-cytochrome f antiserum and also with antiserum to the chloroplast large subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (LSU) to verify equal loading (Fig. 3, panels W). In the wild type, the in vitro synthesized suppressor strain, and in the suppressor strain, cytochrome f accumulates to normal levels. Northern analysis also demonstrates that mRNA for each wild type and mutant strain accumulates to wild-type levels (Fig. 3, panel N), as compared to the levels of 16 S rRNA. Both V16D and A15E introduce charges into the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence, and Arg-10 lies at the amino-terminal boundary of the hydrophobic core. Thus the R10L and R10C mutations may simply allow the hydrophobic core to shift toward the amino terminus thereby effectively eliminating the charged residues from the hydrophobic core (Fig. 4). Alternatively, both Ala-15 and Val-16 lie on the same face of the predicted α-helix, and Arg-10 lies on the opposite face when this region is displayed as a helical wheel. Thus the elimination of the charge by R10L (or R10C) may permit that face, rather than the newly charged Ala-15/Val-16 face, to interact with another (unidentified) component of the thylakoid translocation machinery. To distinguish between the hydrophobic core shift hypothesis and the one described by the helical wheel, we performed the following experiment. Normally the mutation A12E has no effect on cytochrome f translocation and allows photosynthetic growth (Fig. 3) as cytochrome f is efficiently translocated (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); A12E may be positioned too near the amino-terminal end of the hydrophobic core to be inhibitory. If the R10L substitution permits an amino-terminal shifting of the hydrophobic core, then A12E would likely be more central and included in the shifted core and could now be inhibitory (i.e. in the triple mutant R10L/A12E/V16D, Fig. 4). Alternatively, Ala-12 lies on the same face of the predicted α-helix as Val-16 and Ala-15. If the α-helix face hypothesis is correct, then A12E mutation should have no affect in the triple mutant. The triple mutant R10L/A12E/V16D was constructed in vitro by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, and introduced into a wild-type Chlamydomonas strain using sprstr for initial selection. Strains carrying the three mutations in cytochrome f were screened by single cell cloning and hybridization with the mutant oligonucleotide containing the R10L/A12E/V16D mutations (Fig. 2). Homoplasmic strains were obtained that carry the changes, and the presence of mutant but not wild-type copies of petA was verified by Southern blotting using mutant or wild-type oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 2). These new strains were tested for their ability to grow photosynthetically, and for steady state levels of cytochrome f mRNA and protein. The results are shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. While all strains accumulate normal or near normal levels of cytochrome f mRNA, the triple mutant (R10L/A12E/V16D) does not grow photosynthetically in the absence of acetate (HS versus TAP, Fig. 3). Nucleic acid probes to the 16 S rRNA were used to standardize the RNA from four individual experiments, and the ratio between the cytochrome f and 16 S rRNA varied at most 10% between individual strains. Western analysis indicates that cytochrome f does not accumulate in the strain carrying the triple mutation, but does in the wild type, the suppressor (R10L/V16D), and the strain having only A12E. Western blotting the same samples with anti-ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase LSU demonstrates that approximate equal amounts of protein were indeed analyzed. Thus the data are consistent with the shifting of the hydrophobic core toward the amino-terminal region, and not with the orientation of specific amino acids residues on the helical wheel. The cytochrome f signal sequence is required for translocation across the thylakoid membrane in vivo (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This signal sequence, similar to the bacterial signal sequences, requires a region that is predicted to be α-helical and vacant of charged residues (1von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that the exact sequence content of the hydrophobic core is not critical, although it cannot include charged residues. Moreover, the charged amino acid that flanks the amino-terminal side of the hydrophobic core is not essential for the accumulation of cytochrome f. It has been shown previously that the A15E and V16D mutations cause an accumulation of small amounts of labile cytochrome f precursor which cannot be detected in wild type cells (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the data indicated that translocation was greatly slowed and even abolished in the case of the V16D mutant strain. One possible mechanism of elevating the reduced levels of mature cytochrome f in the A15E and V16D mutations thereby suppressing their effect may have been to increase the cytochrome f expression levels. However, the mRNA and protein levels in the chloroplast suppressor strains that restore photosynthetic growth are similar to wild type. Thus overexpression is not the mechanism of suppression in this example. This is supported by the observation that the suppression of V16D and A15E is due solely to the R10L/C substitution, and these changes alone would be unlikely to drastically increase cytochrome f expression. The cytochrome f signal sequence is similar to those sequences directing proteins to the bacterial inner membrane as this hydrophobic core is bounded by an amino-terminal charged residue which is not essential for translocation in vivo (1von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). However, in vitro studies with bacterial membranes indicate that mutations in this charged region result in a reduced rate of translocation, although this appears to be protein specific (1von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 17Bieker K.L. Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. J. Bioenerg.

Our results cannot rule out the possibility that the cytochrome f suppressor mutations that fully restore cytochrome f levels in vivo subtly change the kinetics of thylakoid translocation, and that our in vivo assay is not sufficiently sensitive to detect these changes. The molecular and genetic analysis of the four nuclear suppressors tip (5Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) should help to clarify the role of the cytochrome f signal, to identify the proteins that mediate translocation, and to evaluate the extent to which the “multiple translocation pathways” of the thylakoid actually interact and overlap. We thank Karen Bernd, Phillip Hartzog, Jim Siedow, Bill Zerges, Andrea Auchincloss, and Michel Goldschmidt-Clermont for helpful comments, and Tracy Smith and Melony Pogash for the isolation of the suppressor mutations."

After photo-oxidation, the steady-state phosphorylation by ATP remains almost unchanged, whereas phosphorylation by inorganic phosphate is impaired. The pseudo-first order rate constants for phosphorylation by 15 µM ATP at 25°C are strongly inhibited when starting from either a Ca2+-bound or a Ca2+-free enzyme form, decreasing from 145 to 23 s−1 for the Ca2+-bound form and from 50 to 18 s−1 for the Ca2+-free form. Concurrently, the rate constants for dephosphorylation are also severely inhibited, changing from a fast double exponential to a very slow single exponential decay in the reverse direction and from a moderately slow single to a very slow single exponential decay in the forward direction. Ca2+ binding data show that the phosphorylated intermediate formed by the photo-oxidized enzyme contains two occluded Ca2+, and TNP-ATP fluorescence measurements indicate that it accumulates in a E1-P·;Ca2-like conformation. Protection by ADP against glutaraldehyde-induced cross-linking indicates that ADP binding to Ca2+-ATPase is not impaired by photo-oxidation nor by free erythrosin.

Ca2+-ATPase is a 115-kDa transmembrane protein that couples ATP hydrolysis to removal of Ca2+ from the cytosol in skeletal muscle fibers, triggering the end of muscular contraction (Hasselbach and Makinose, 21Hasselbach W.

The primary structure of this enzyme has been determined and has led to predictions of secondary structure and enzyme topology (Brandl et al., 5Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H.

Efforts to map the enzyme functionally have used chemical modification by specific reagents and site-specific mutagenesis. This latter technique has been used recently to identify amino acids that affect kinetic parameters related to the catalytic site and to the Ca2+ binding sites (Maruyama and MacLennan, 37Maruyama K.

In addition, many amino acids have been labeled, identified, and located within the primary structure using a variety of probes for the nucleotide binding site. These experiments have almost always involved probes that bind covalently to the enzyme, such as FITC (Mitchinson et al., 42Mitchinson C. Wilderspin A.F. Trinnaman B.J. Green N.M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 146: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), 8-azido-ATP (Lacapère et al., 30Lacapère J.J. Garin J. Trinnaman B. Green N.M.

Acta. 1990; 1039: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), or chemical reagents that cause radical structural changes, such as glutaraldehyde (McIntosh, 39McIntosh D.B. J. Biol.

Thus, kinetic parameters such as those involved in enzyme phosphorylation and dephosphorylation could not always be assessed with the labeled enzyme, and the precise functional role of the labeled amino acids remains uncertain. sarcoplasmic reticulum fluorescein isothiocyanate 2-[N-morpholino]ethane-sulfonic acid 3-[N-morpholino]propane-sulfonic acid 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene)adenosine 5′-triphosphate. It has been reported that Ca2+-ATPase modified with FITC loses all the activities related to ATP binding (Pick, 51Pick U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 121: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar; Pick and Bassilian, 52Pick U. Bassilian S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because Lys-515, which is the point of attachment of FITC to the enzyme, is neither unusually reactive toward FITC (Murphy, 46Murphy A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 946: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) nor essential for ATP hydrolysis (Maruyama et al., 38Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested that it is the fluorescein moiety of FITC that directs the reaction toward the ATP site. Thus, affinity binding of fluorescein would bring the isothiocyanate group close to Lys-515, promoting a specific attachment, and fluorescein would then remain anchored to the putative ATP binding site, thus leading to inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase activity. In this study we use erythrosin B, a halogenated derivative of fluorescein that is considered to bind to enzyme nucleotide binding sites with high affinity and specificity (Lundblad and Noyes, 35Lundblad R.L. Noyes C.M. Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification. 1. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1984: 105Google Scholar; Neslund et al., 48Neslund G.G. Miara J.E. Kang J.-J. Dahms A.S. Curr. Top. Cell.

Erythrosin is capable of promoting selective photo-oxidation of amino acids, which can be useful in the identification of groups involved in catalysis (Lundblad and Noyes, 35Lundblad R.L. Noyes C.M. Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification. 1. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1984: 105Google Scholar; Neslund et al., 48Neslund G.G. Miara J.E. Kang J.-J. Dahms A.S. Curr. Top. Cell.

Oxford University Press, New York1989: 69Google Scholar), and has two advantages: even after photo-oxidation the sites would still be able to bind ATP, and no bulky group would remain covalently bound to the enzyme. Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were obtained from rabbit hind leg skeletal muscle as described by Eletr and Inesi (15Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase was purified by method number 2 of Meissner et al. (40Meissner G. Conner G.E. Fleischer S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 298: 246-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Protein determinations were performed according to Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Unless otherwise stated, Ca2+-ATPase was incubated with the dyes for 10 min at 25°C under room light in medium containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.05 mM CaCl2, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and the dye concentrations specified in the legends before starting the reactions. The protein concentration on the assays could vary from 10 to 50 µg/ml. In this range there was no significant variation in the sensitivity of the ATPase toward photo-inhibition by erythrosin. However, when the protein concentration was raised to 0.2 mg/ml for the experiments of phosphorylation by Pi, approximately three times as much erythrosin was needed to reach the same extent of inhibition. ATPase activities were assayed at 37°C in reaction medium containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.05 mM CaCl2, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10-20 µg/ml purified Ca2+-ATPase, and 2 mM ATP. In most cases, activity was determined by counting the amount of radioactive Pi released from [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was quenched and free nucleotide was trapped by the addition of an equal volume of activated charcoal suspended in 0.1 N HCl (Grubmeyer and Penefsky, 19Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3728-3734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation the Pi remaining in the supernatant was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. In some experiments, release of nonradioactive Pi was measured using molybdovanadate reagent (Lin and Morales, 33Lin T. Morales M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 77: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The differential absorbance spectrum for control versus erythrosin-treated samples was recorded using a Milton-Roy Spectronic 3000 Array Spectrophotometer. The samples contained 0.2 mg/ml Ca2+-ATPase, 1 µM erythrosin, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 50 µM CaCl2. The absorbance spectra were recorded before photo-oxidation and then after a 60-min incubation period, either in the presence or the absence of light, and the differential absorbance spectrum was calculated. Ca2+-ATPase (20-50 µg/ml) was incubated at 25°C in medium with the same composition used to measure ATPase activity but using 15 µM [γ-32P]ATP. After photo-oxidation, phosphorylation of the enzyme was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP, and the reaction was quenched after 3 s by adding 10 volumes of an ice-cold solution of 250 mM perchloric acid and 5 mM Pi. Samples were then filtered through Millipore filters (0.45-µm pore size) and washed five times with the same volume of quenching solution. The amount of radioactivity on the filters was counted in a liquid scintillation counter, and phosphoenzyme was determined according to Knowles and Racker (29Knowles A.F. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1949-1951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase (0.1 mg) was phosphorylated in 0.5 ml of a medium containing 20 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.0), 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, and 4 mM [32P]Pi. After 5 min, the reaction was quenched by adding 10 volumes of ice-cold 250 mM perchloric acid and 5 mM Pi. The resulting samples were treated as described above to measure incorporated [32P]Pi. The formation or decay of phosphoenzyme was followed using a rapid mixing device coupled to either two or three syringes. For phosphorylation experiments, one syringe contained Ca2+-ATPase (40 µg/ml), 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, and varying erythrosin, whereas a second syringe contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 80 mM KCl, 30 µM [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM CaCl2. In some experiments, both syringes contained 0.05 mM CaCl2, and the same concentration of erythrosin. The protein solution of syringe 1 was preincubated for 10 min at 25°C under room light before initiating the phosphorylation reactions. The solutions were forced through a mixing chamber connected to a capillary tube, whose length was varied to obtain different reaction times. This capillary emptied into a quenching tube containing 5 volumes of a mixture of 250 mM perchloric acid and 5 mM Pi. For dephosphorylation experiments, the capillary was connected to a second mixing chamber, to which a third syringe delivered the dephosphorylation solution (a volume equivalent to 88% of the sum of volumes of syringes 1 and 2). Syringe 3 contained 22.8 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 91.2 mM KCl, 5.7 mM MgCl2, 6.84 mM EGTA, 0 or 2.28 mM ADP, and 1.14 times the dye concentration used in syringes 1 and 2. Reactions were quenched in acid, and phosphorylated protein samples were treated as above. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated with the Ca2+-EGTA dissociation constants of Schwarzenbach et al. (56Schwarzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1957; 40: 1886-1900Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar), using an algorithm developed by Fabiato and Fabiato (16Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 75: 463-505Google Scholar). Reaction media were the same as that used for ATPase activity measurements, except that 2 mM CaCl2 and various EGTA concentrations were added. Ca2+ binding to control and erythrosin-photo-oxidized Ca2+-ATPase was measured in medium containing 10 µM [45Ca]CaCl2, 50 µg/ml Ca2+-ATPase, 2 mM ATP, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 80 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. Reactions were stopped by Millipore filtration, and the retained radioactivity was counted. Blanks obtained either by processing the reaction at pH 5.0 or by omission of the enzyme were discounted to correct for nonspecific binding of [45Ca]Ca2+ to the enzyme and for the dead volume of the filters, respectively. Both blanks were identical, and the radioactivity corresponding to specific binding was always equivalent to approximately twice the radioactivity of the blanks. After photo-oxidation with 1 µM erythrosin for 60 min, the Ca2+-ATPase was further incubated with glutaraldehyde for 90 min in the presence of 0-100 µM ADP as described by McIntosh (39McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22328-22335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The medium contained 0.2 mg/ml Ca2+-ATPase, 20 mM MOPS-Tris (pH 8.1), 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM CaCl2, and 0.142 mM glutaraldehyde. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with one volume of a denaturing buffer containing 2% SDS, 8 M urea, 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and 500 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli, 32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). In another set of experiments, photo-oxidation was omitted, and ADP was replaced by equivalent concentrations of erythrosin. Fluorescence was measured at room temperature in a continuously stirred 1-cm light path quartz cuvette using a Hitachi F-3010 spectrofluorimeter. Excitation was set at 408 nm, and emission was set at 540 nm. The emission values were corrected for erythrosin fluorescence and filter effects. Kinetic reactions were simulated in an IBM PC computer, using a program described by Hecht et al. (22Hecht J.P. Nikonov J.M. Alonso G.L. Comput. Programs Biomed. 1990; 33: 13-30Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), modified with the introduction of input-output subroutines. The program, based in an optimization of the fourth order Runge-Kutta-Gill algorithm, was run using an integration time interval of 1 × 10−5 s. ATP and ADP (sodium salts), 2-mercaptoethanol, glutaraldehyde, Tris, MOPS, and EGTA were from Sigma; fluorescein (free acid or sodium salt), erythrosin B, and eosin Y were from Riedel; [45Ca]Ca2+ was from DuPont NEN; [32P]Pi was purchased from IPEN (São Paulo-Brasil) and purified on a Dowex 50-W column according to Kessler et al. (28Kessler R.J. Vaughn D.A. Fanestil D.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 117-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP was prepared according to Walseth and Johnson (69Walseth T.F. Johnson R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 562: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of analytical grade. After a 10-min incubation with the enzyme, erythrosin B proved to be the best photo-inhibitor when compared with fluorescein and eosin Y (Fig. 1A). Erythrosin presented the lowest K0.5 (0.5-1.0 µM), followed by eosin (K0.5 of 4-5 µM) and fluorescein (K0.5 > 100 µM). The extent of inhibition by erythrosin increased with the time of exposure to light and also increased with dye concentration. The addition of ATP (Fig. 1B) or ADP (not shown) during exposure to light partially protected the enzyme against photo-oxidation with erythrosin. The photo-inhibition elicited by erythrosin was irreversible, because several centrifugation-washing cycles or dilution of the phospholipids with large excess of detergents such as polydocanol or C12E8 did not restore the ATPase activity (not shown). Erythrosin (and eosin, not shown) also induced the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis in the absence of light. The K0.5 for this effect was 5-10-fold higher than in the light (Fig. 1C). Unlike the photo-inhibition, the inhibition in the dark was not time-dependent and was almost fully reversible after the washing or detergent treatments indicated above (not shown).To determine whether the protein had indeed been covalently modified by photo-oxidation with erythrosin, we measured the differential absorbance of the protein samples prior to and after reaction in the light. The differential absorption spectrum resulting from the photo-oxidation of Ca2+-ATPase with erythrosin is shown in Fig. 2. This spectrum agrees with the previous observations of Stuart et al. (63Stuart J. Pessah I.N. Favero T.G. Abramson J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) for the photo-oxidation of heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles with rose bengal and strongly suggests that the inhibition in the light is the result of a modification of some amino acid residue of the enzyme, because in the absence of light no variation in absorbance of the samples was detected. However, the photo-oxidation did not significantly modify the isoelectric point of the protein, as revealed by isoelectric focusing of the normal and oxidized protein and by nonionic slab-gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown).Fig. 2Differential absorbance spectrum of Ca2+-ATPase after photo-oxidation. The absorbance spectrum of a sample containing a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, 1 µM erythrosin, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 50 µM CaCl2 was recorded. After irradiation for 60 min, the spectrum of the sample was re-run, and the differential spectrum was calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ATP concentration dependence of Ca2+-ATPase activity was studied using low erythrosin concentrations (0.2 and 0.5 µM) for photo-inhibition in order to achieve measurable ATP hydrolysis together with observable kinetic effects. The photo-inhibition of the ATPase activity induced by erythrosin was not reversed by increasing the ATP concentration. Both Vmax1 and Vmax2 were significantly and proportionally reduced, with no change in the affinity for ATP at the catalytic site. However, a significant decrease was observed in the apparent affinity for the secondary activation induced by ATP. These data are summarized in Table I. A similar inhibitory behavior with erythrosin was observed for the erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase by Mugica et al. (44Mugica H. Rega A.F. Garrahan P.H. Acta Physiol. Pharmacol. Latinoam. 1984; 34: 163-173PubMed Google Scholar). Those authors concluded that inhibition with erythrosin was noncompetitive with ATP for the catalytic site but that the dye modified the affinity and competed with ATP for the regulatory site of the enzyme.Table IKinetic parameters of the Ca2+-ATPase photo-inhibited with erythrosinErythrosinKm1Vm1Km2Vm2µMµMµmol/mg/minµMµmol/mg/min01.171.3350010.50.21.001.118339.00.51.110.9112507.7 Open table in a new tab The affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+ was not modified by photo-inhibition, considering both the high and low affinity Ca2+ binding sites, although the apparent cooperativity may have been slightly decreased (Fig. 3). Equilibrium binding of Ca2+ to the photo-oxidized enzyme reached the same values as in the control, attaining approximately 8 nmol of [45Ca]Ca2+ bound per milligram of Ca2+-ATPase with 10 µM Ca2+ in the medium. This result rules out the possibility that the observed decrease in ATPase activity could be due to destruction of the Ca2+ binding sites transforming the inhibited enzyme into an incompetent silent form. It also establishes that inhibition is not a result of nonsaturation of these sites due to a decrease in affinity. The same steady-state values for phosphorylation with ATP were obtained with control enzyme and photo-inhibited Ca2+-ATPase after illumination with 5 µM erythrosin during 10 min. Because ATPase activity was inhibited up to 80% in these conditions, this observation indicates that photo-oxidation led to a slower turnover rate. A slow and probably nonspecific reaction finally impaired phosphorylation by ATP (not shown). Table II shows the steady-state values obtained for phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]Pi. For comparison, the effects elicited by fluorescein are also shown. Although the E1·;Ca2 form remained fully phosphorylatable by ATP, phosphorylation of Ca2+-free enzyme by orthophosphate was gradually impaired, showing that reactions attributed to the E2 conformation of the enzyme were affected dramatically. The same results were obtained regardless of whether the pre-incubation with erythrosin was done in the presence or the absence of Ca2+. Therefore, the site where photo-inhibition takes place seems to be accessible to erythrosin in both the E1 and E2 conformations. As also shown in Table II, the effects observed with erythrosin were similarly obtained with fluorescein, in spite of fluorescein being a less effective photo-inhibitor and consequently requiring much higher dye concentrations. It is also worth noting that these results are totally different from those obtained with Ca2+-ATPase after labeling with FITC, where phosphorylation by ATP is drastically impaired (because the putative ATP binding site is occupied by the covalently bound label) and phosphorylation by Pi is not affected at all (Pick and Bassilian, 52Pick U. Bassilian S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Table IISteady-state levels of phosphoenzyme formed with ATP or Pi by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase photo-oxidized with erythrosin or fluorescein[Dye]E-P with ATPE-P with PiµM%Erythrosin0.2102.2 ± 1.994.6 ± 1.80.598.5 ± 5.097.2 ± 4.82.0101.3 ± 4.269.2 ± 8.05.097.0 ± 6.158.9 ± 4.8Fluorescein10101.7 ± 2.096.5 ± 1.52098.9 ± 1.081.0 ± 5.410094.3 ± 5.766.8 ± 12.020086.8 ± 1.540.5 ± 2.0 Open table in a new tab As described above, the steady-state levels of ATP-derived phosphoenzyme, as well as the apparent affinity of the catalytic site for ATP, were not modified by photo-inhibition with erythrosin, although overall enzyme activity was markedly decreased. The time course for phosphorylation of Ca2+-ATPase by ATP is depicted in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, A and B, control and photo-oxidized enzyme were preincubated in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, and the phosphorylation reaction was started by the addition of ATP, whereas in Fig. 4, C and D, enzyme phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of ATP and Ca2+ to the enzyme previously exposed to light in the presence of EGTA and Mg2+ with or without the dye. In both cases, a marked reduction of the phosphorylation rate was observed in the photo-inhibited enzyme. However, inhibition with the dye induced a proportionally greater decrease (k ≅ 145 s−1 to k′ ≅ 23 s−1) in the initial apparent phosphorylation rate when the phosphorylation reactions were started with the Ca2+-bound enzyme (Fig. 4, A and B) than when enzyme was preincubated in EGTA (k ≅ 50 s−1, k′ ≅ 18 s−1) beforehand (Fig. 4, C and D). Conversely, maximal phosphorylation levels similar to control tended to be reached both by the Ca2+-incubated and EGTA-incubated enzyme. It must be stressed that the reaction rates observed for phosphorylation of the photo-oxidized enzyme are very similar regardless of the initial (i.e. whether Ca2+ was bound or not) enzyme conformation. At the concentrations used in this work, Ca2+ and ATP binding to the E1 form of the enzyme are expected to be very fast when compared with the E2-E1 conformational transition rate (Scofano et al., 57Scofano H.M. Vieyra A.R. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10227-10231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is assumed that isomerization from E2 to E1 would be the rate-limiting step for phosphorylation of the native Ca2+-ATPase when beginning with the E2 form of the enzyme. However, after photo-oxidation this rate-limiting step seems to be superseded due to slowing of a subsequent step, which makes the overall phosphorylation reaction rates very slow, and similar irrespective of the initial conformer. Changing the rate of ATP binding would be expected to change the Kd for ATP and shift the Km to higher values, a change that was not observed for the catalytic site of the photo-oxidized enzyme (see Table I). Thus, it is likely that the phosphoryl transfer reaction was affected by reaction with erythrosin. Photo-oxidation had a pronounced effect on the dephosphorylation rates of ATP-formed phosphoenzyme. The dephosphorylation reaction was much slower than control both for the forward (EGTA-induced) and backward (ADP-sensitive) directions. The EGTA-induced phosphoenzyme decay showed a pronounced decrease in the observed rate constants for the photo-oxidized enzyme, decreasing from k ≅ 3.36 s−1 to k′ ≅ 1.1 s−1 (Fig. 5, A and B). The extent of inhibition was higher the higher the dye concentrations used (not shown). Although photo-inhibition severely impaired phosphoenzyme decay in both the forward and reverse directions, the inhibition was much more accentuated on the ADP-sensitive pathway, and the typical two-exponential, fast ADP-sensitive decay (k1≅ 183 s−1; k2≅ 20 s−1) became so inhibited that it could be simply fitted with a slow (k′ ≅ 0.75 s−1), single exponential decay (Fig. 5, C and D). Binding of ADP to the phosphoenzyme was probably not impaired by photo-oxidation, because in these experiments the enzyme was already phosphorylated by ATP (evidencing nucleotide binding) and also because ADP was still able to protect against the well described glutaraldehyde-induced intramolecular cross-linking (McIntosh, 39McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22328-22335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the same conditions and to the same extent for both the control and the photo-oxidized enzyme (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, erythrosin, in the absence of illumination, efficiently protected against this glutaraldehyde-induced cross-linking (Fig. 6B), suggesting that both ADP and erythrosin (and probably ATP also), may bind to a common site or induce similar enzyme conformations. Therefore, our results point toward the accumulation of a trapped, ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme. This could be the E2-P·;Ca2 or the E2-P form or a modified form of E1-P·;Ca2, which binds ADP but can not efficiently resynthesize ATP due to the lack of one or more amino acids essential to the synthesis reaction.Fig"
