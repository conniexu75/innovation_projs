https://openalex.org/W1965765914,"Observations show that large variations in the strength of the stratospheric circulation, appearing first above approximately 50 kilometers, descend to the lowermost stratosphere and are followed by anomalous tropospheric weather regimes. During the 60 days after the onset of these events, average surface pressure maps resemble closely the Arctic Oscillation pattern. These stratospheric events also precede shifts in the probability distributions of extreme values of the Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillations, the location of storm tracks, and the local likelihood of mid-latitude storms. Our observations suggest that these stratospheric harbingers may be used as a predictor of tropospheric weather regimes."

Clearing upwind lowland forest alters surface energy budgets in ways that influence dry season cloud fields and thus the TMCF environment. Landsat and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite imagery show that deforested areas of Costa Rica's Caribbean lowlands remain relatively cloud-free when forested regions have well-developed dry season cumulus cloud fields. Further, regional atmospheric simulations show that cloud base heights are higher over pasture than over tropical forest areas under reasonable dry season conditions. These results suggest that land use in tropical lowlands has serious impacts on ecosystems in adjacent mountains."
https://openalex.org/W2326648943,"MCF-7 human breast cancer cells do not express caspase 3, thought by some to be a critical component of the apoptosis cascade. Nonetheless, both mock- and bcl-2-transfected MCF-7 cells undergo apoptosis after treatment with a variety of stimuli, including the DNA-cleaving antimitotic agent, neocarzinostatin (NCS). Transfection with bcl-2 shifts the concentration-response curve to NCS but does not change the phenomenology of apoptosis when it occurs. In both cases, NCS treatment results in condensation and fragmentation of MCF-7 cell nuclei and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. This apoptosis is accompanied by decreased levels of Bcl-2 and increased levels of Bax. Using a series of caspase inhibitors with overlapping specificities, enzyme-specific chromogenic substrates, and an antibody specific for activated caspase 7, we have determined that apoptosis in MCF-7 cells proceeds via sequential activation of caspases 9, 7 and 6. P21 is detected only after activation of caspase 7, and P53 is neither expressed at baseline nor up-regulated with apoptosis induction. This pathway bypasses the need for activated caspase 3 in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024722383,"The onset of human lung cancer occurs through sequential mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Mutations in K-Ras play a prominent role in human non-small cell lung cancer. We have developed a mouse lung tumor model in which K-Ras can be sporadically activated through Cre-lox mediated somatic recombination. Adenoviral mediated delivery of Cre recombinase in lung epithelial cells gave rise to rapid onset of tumorigenesis, yielding pulmonary adenocarcinomas with 100% incidence after a short latency. The lung tumor lesions shared many features with human non-small cell lung cancer. Our data show that sporadic expression of the K-Ras oncogene is sufficient to elicit lung tumorigenesis. Therefore this model has many advantages over conventional transgenic models used thus far."
https://openalex.org/W2059822676,"We have developed ribozymes (Rz) that inhibit BRCA1 expression in order to study the role of this gene in chemosensitivity. Two Rz, targeting positions 358 or 5282 of the BRCA1 mRNA, were cloned into the retroviral vector LXSN and lipofected into the breast cancer cell-line HBL100. We obtained 79-99% inhibition of BRCA1 expression, as determined by real-time quantitative PCR and by Western blotting. Decreased expression of BRCA1 led to sensitivity to the DNA damaging agents cisplatin and etoposide, resistance to the microtubule-interfering agents (MIA) taxol and vincristine. The molecular mechanism of resistance to MIA was investigated further by determining the status of the JNK pathway. We found that JNK1 expression was elevated, while JNK2 expression was decreased in Rz-expressing clones compared to controls. We have quantified the mRNA levels of BRCA1, JNK1, 2, MEK-4, -7 and c-jun after treatment with MIA. Vincristine treatment of control cells resulted in transcriptional repression of BRCA1, while the JNK1, 2, MEK-4, -7 and c-jun genes were induced. In Rz-treated cells, only JNK1 and MEK-4 were expressed and none was induced after MIA treatment. We then studied the phosphorylation of c-jun, a downstream effector of the JNK pathway. We observed a strong increase in phosphorylated c-jun after MIA treatment of the control cells but not in BRCA1-Rz treated cells, suggesting inhibition of the JNK pathway. These results show that the BRCA1-JNK pathway is involved in the cytotoxic response to MIA treatment, and inhibition of BRCA1 leads to transcriptional modifications of the JNK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2009271990,"African trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that cause sleeping sickness in humans through a tsetse fly vector. The procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei has a single, attached flagellum that describes a helical path along the cell from posterior to anterior. During division, a specific flagellum-flagellum connection is elaborated between the new and old flagellum. This connector was present only during cell duplication and was found to be involved in the replication of the helical cell pattern and polarity. This finding implicates the concept of cytotaxis in cell morphogenesis in trypanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2088852482,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is mutated in more than 50% of all human cancers, which makes the study of its functions and activities critical for the understanding and management of cancer. In response to cellular stresses, p53 is activated and can mediate cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis via the upregulation of numerous target genes. Here, we have identified EphA2 as a target gene of the p53 family, that is, p53, p73, and p63. We also found that an increase of EphA2 transcript levels correlated with an increase of EphA2 protein expression, and induction of EphA2 in response to DNA damage corresponded with p53 activation. Furthermore, we identified a p53 response element located within the EphA2 promoter that is responsive to wild-type p53, p73, and p63, but not mutant p53. Interestingly, the ligand for EphA2, ephrin-A1, is also regulated by p53. EphA2 and ephrin-A1 are members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and ligands, which are implicated in a number of developmental processes. To analyse the role of EphA2 in p53-mediated tumor suppression, we generated stable cell lines capable of expressing exogenous EphA2 in a tetracycline-repressible system. We found that EphA2 expression resulted in an increase in apoptosis. Thus, we hypothesize that the activated EphA2 may serve to impair anti-apoptotic signaling, perhaps by disrupting focal adhesions and thereby sensitize cells to pro-apoptotic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2040349424,"In the absence of a comprehensive fossil record, the origin and early evolution of Malagasy lemurs have been subject to much uncertainty. We report here the discovery of a strepsirrhine fossil with strong cheirogaleid lemur affinities, Bugtilemur mathesoni gen. et sp. nov., from early Oligocene deposits of the Bugti Hills (Balochistan, Pakistan). Bugtilemur represents the earliest record of Lemuriformes, which hence appear to have already diversified outside of Madagascar at least 30 million years ago. This fossil clearly enhances the critical role of the Indian subcontinent in the early diversification of lemurs and constrains paleobiogeographic models of strepsirrhine lemur evolution."

We demonstrate that in the chick head, integration between the epibranchial placodes and the hindbrain is achieved as the neuroglial hindbrain crest cells guide the epibranchial neuronal cells inward to establish their central connections. This work defines a role for the neuroglial hindbrain crest in organizing the afferent innervation of the hindbrain."
https://openalex.org/W2009590659,"In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel human Ste20-related kinase that we designated MST4 (accession number AF231012). The 416 amino acid full-length MST4 contains an amino-terminal kinase domain, which is highly homologous to MST3 and SOK, and a unique carboxy-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis indicated that MST4 is highly expressed in placenta, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Wild-type but not kinase-dead MST4 can phosphorylate myelin basic protein in an in vitro kinase assay. MST4 specifically activates ERK but not JNK or p38 MAPK in transient transfected cells or in stable cell lines. Overexpression of dominant negative MEK1 or treatment with PD98059 abolishes MST4-induced ERK activity, whereas dominant-negative Ras or c-Raf-1 mutants failed to do so, indicating MST4 activates MEK1/ERK via a Ras/Raf-1 independent pathway. HeLa and Phoenix cell lines overexpressing wild-type, but not kinase-dead, MST4 exhibit increased growth rate and form aggressive soft-agar colonies. These phenotypes can be inhibited by PD98059. These results provide the first evidence that MST4 is biologically active in the activation of MEK/ERK pathway and in mediating cell growth and transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2127893201,"Animals and many plants are counted in discrete units. The collection of possible values (state space) of population numbers is thus a nonnegative integer lattice. Despite this fact, many mathematical population models assume a continuum of system states. The complex dynamics, such as chaos, often displayed by such continuous-state models have stimulated much ecological research; yet discrete-state models with bounded population size can display only cyclic behavior. Motivated by data from a population experiment, we compared the predictions of discrete-state and continuous-state population models. Neither the discrete- nor continuous-state models completely account for the data. Rather, the observed dynamics are explained by a stochastic blending of the chaotic dynamics predicted by the continuous-state model and the cyclic dynamics predicted by the discrete-state models. We suggest that such lattice effects could be an important component of natural population fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2095249676,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein complex that mediates the cotranslational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to cellular membranes. A crucial early step in SRP assembly in archaea and eukarya is the binding of protein SRP19 to specific sites on SRP RNA. Here we report the 1.8 angstrom resolution crystal structure of human SRP19 in complex with its primary binding site on helix 6 of SRP RNA, which consists of a stem-loop structure closed by an unusual GGAG tetraloop. Protein-RNA interactions are mediated by the specific recognition of a widened major groove and the tetraloop without any direct protein-base contacts and include a complex network of highly ordered water molecules. A model of the assembly of the SRP core comprising SRP19, SRP54, and SRP RNA based on crystallographic and biochemical data is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1972196578,"Biochips containing microarrays of genetic information promise to be important research tools in the postgenomic era. Because DNA microarray can contain many thousands of samples, each representing a single gene, it is possible to design a single chip containing the complete gene set of a complex organism (30,000 to 60,000 genes). DNA microarrays provide a powerful way to simultaneously analyze the expression of thousands of genes. This article describes the design and uses of microarrays of DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2115137049,"The activation of sphingomyelinases leading to the generation of ceramide has been implicated in various apoptotic pathways. However, the role of ceramide as an essential death mediator remains highly controversial. In the present study, we investigated the functional relevance of ceramide in a genetic model by using primary cells from a Farber disease patient. These cells accumulate ceramide as the result of an inherited deficiency of acidic ceramidase. We demonstrate that Farber disease lymphocytes and fibroblasts underwent apoptosis induced by various stress stimuli, including staurosporine, anticancer drugs and gamma-irradiation, equally as normal control cells. In addition, caspase activation by these proapoptotic agents occurred rather similarly in Farber disease and control fibroblasts. Interestingly, Farber disease lymphoid cells underwent apoptosis induced by the CD95 death receptor more rapidly than control cells. Our data therefore suggest that ceramide does not play an essential role as a second messenger in stress-induced apoptosis. However, in accordance with a role in lipid-rich microdomains, ceramide by altering membrane composition may function as an amplifier in CD95-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2042802568,"The actin filament-associated protein of 110 kDa (AFAP-110) is a Src binding partner that represents a potential modulator of actin filament integrity in response to cellular signals. Previous reports have demonstrated that AFAP-110 is capable of directly binding and altering actin filaments. Deletion of the leucine zipper motif of AFAP-110 (AFAP-110(Deltalzip)) has been shown to induce a phenotype which resembles Src-transformed cells, by repositioning actin filaments into rosettes. This deletion also mimics a conformational change in AFAP-110 that is detected in Src-transformed cells. The results presented here indicate that unlike AFAP-110, AFAP-110(Deltalzip) is capable of activating cellular tyrosine kinases, including Src family members, and that AFAP-110(Deltalzip) itself is hyperphosphorylated. The newly tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and activated Src-family members appear to be associated with actin-rich lamellipodia. A point mutation that alters the SH3-binding motif of AFAP-110(Deltalzip) prevents it from activating tyrosine kinases and altering actin filament integrity. In addition, a deletion within a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of AFAP-110(Deltalzip) will also revert its effects upon actin filaments. Lastly, dominant-positive RhoA(V14) will block the ability of AFAP-110(Deltalzip) from inducing actin filament rosettes, but does not inhibit Src activation. Thus, conformational changes in AFAP-110 enable it to activate cellular kinases in a mechanism requiring SH3 and/or PH domain interactions. We hypothesize that cellular signals which alter AFAP-110 conformation, enable it to activate cellular kinases such as cSrc, which then direct changes in actin filament integrity in a Rho-dependent fashion."

https://openalex.org/W2326862090,"Maspin is a novel serine protease inhibitor (serpin) with tumor suppressive activity. To date, despite the mounting evidence implicating the potential diagnostic/prognostic and therapeutic value of maspin in breast and prostate carcinoma, the lack of a suitable animal model hampers the in vivo investigation on the role of maspin at different stages of tumor progression. In this study, we used MMTV/TGF-alpha transgenic mouse model to study the expression profile of maspin in mammary tumor progression. Histopathological examinations of MMTV/TGF-alpha transgenic mice revealed TGF-alpha expression leading to hyperproliferation, hyperplasia, and occasional carcinoma in mammary gland. Interestingly, when MMTV/TGF-alpha transgenic mice were breed to homozygocity, they also developed characteristic skin papillomas. Immunohistochemistry analysis of maspin expression in the breast tissues of TGF-alpha transgenic mice showed a direct correlation between down-regulation of maspin expression and tumor progression. The loss of maspin expression was concomitant with the critical transition from carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma. Subsequent in-situ hybridization analyses suggest that the down-regulation of maspin expression is primarily a transcriptional event. This data is consistent with the tumor suppressive role of maspin. Furthermore, our data suggests that MMTV/TGF-alpha transgenic mouse model is advantageous for in vivo evaluation of both the expression and the biological function of maspin during the slow multi-stage carcinogenesis of mammary gland."

https://openalex.org/W2022013689,The conflicts of ethics and public policy surrounding fetal research are discussed. Several states have adopted legislation regulating such research and the United States Congress has enacted a moratorium on experiments on live fetuses. The origin of the Massachusetts fetal research law is traced and the discussions and compromises between proponents of a restrictive law and the research scientists are related. In the final bill antenatal diagnoses of inherited defects is to be permitted and written consent of the mother is required before any experiment on a dead fetus. The law does not regulate diagnostic or remedial research. Although scientific groups are attempting to amend it the Massuchesetts law is regarded as more liberal than those in some other states.
