https://openalex.org/W1993577573,"Whole-genome sequences of two novel SARS-CoV-related bat coronaviruses, in addition to a live isolate of a bat SARS-like coronavirus, are reported; the live isolate can infect human cells using ACE2, providing the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV. Peter Daszak and colleagues identify two novel coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats that are closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the cause of a pandemic during 2002 and 2003. They also isolate a live virus from these bats that has high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and that can infect human cells using ACE2, the same receptor that is used by SARS-CoV. The results provide the strongest evidence to date that horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV. The 2002–3 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was one of the most significant public health events in recent history1. An ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 suggests that this group of viruses remains a key threat and that their distribution is wider than previously recognized. Although bats have been suggested to be the natural reservoirs of both viruses3,4,5, attempts to isolate the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV from bats have been unsuccessful. Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have now been reported from bats in China, Europe and Africa5,6,7,8, but none is considered a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV because of their phylogenetic disparity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins to use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule, the human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)9,10. Here we report whole-genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae) in Yunnan, China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat coronaviruses, particularly in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen-discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness."

https://openalex.org/W2135847964,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific monoclonal antibodies with extraordinary potency and breadth have recently been described. In humanized mice, combinations of monoclonal antibodies have been shown to suppress viraemia, but the therapeutic potential of these monoclonal antibodies has not yet been evaluated in primates with an intact immune system. Here we show that administration of a cocktail of HIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies, as well as the single glycan-dependent monoclonal antibody PGT121, resulted in a rapid and precipitous decline of plasma viraemia to undetectable levels in rhesus monkeys chronically infected with the pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIV-SF162P3. A single monoclonal antibody infusion afforded up to a 3.1 log decline of plasma viral RNA in 7 days and also reduced proviral DNA in peripheral blood, gastrointestinal mucosa and lymph nodes without the development of viral resistance. Moreover, after monoclonal antibody administration, host Gag-specific T-lymphocyte responses showed improved functionality. Virus rebounded in most animals after a median of 56 days when serum monoclonal antibody titres had declined to undetectable levels, although, notably, a subset of animals maintained long-term virological control in the absence of further monoclonal antibody infusions. These data demonstrate a profound therapeutic effect of potent neutralizing HIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies in SHIV-infected rhesus monkeys as well as an impact on host immune responses. Our findings strongly encourage the investigation of monoclonal antibody therapy for HIV-1 in humans."

https://openalex.org/W1989174077,"A new generation of broad and potent anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies has recently been isolated; co-administration of two such antibodies is shown here to result in rapid and potent suppression of plasma viraemia in five chronically SHIV-infected macaques that lasts for several weeks. Two papers published this week test the new generation of broad and potent anti-HIV1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in primate models with promising results, both concluding that their results strongly encourage the investigation of mAb therapy for HIV-1 in humans. Dan Barouch et al. show that a single infusion of the potent, broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibody PGT121, as well as various mAb cocktails, suppress the virus to undetectable levels in just a week in SHIV-infected rhesus monkeys. Masashi Shingai et al. report that co-administration of the antibodies 3BNC117 and 10-1074 results in potent suppression of plasma viraemia lasting for several weeks in chronically SHIV-infected macaques. Neutralizing antibodies can confer immunity to primate lentiviruses by blocking infection in macaque models of AIDS1,2,3,4. However, earlier studies of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neutralizing antibodies administered to infected individuals or humanized mice reported poor control of virus replication and the rapid emergence of resistant variants5,6,7. A new generation of anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies, possessing extraordinary potency and breadth of neutralizing activity, has recently been isolated from infected individuals8. These neutralizing antibodies target different regions of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein including the CD4-binding site, glycans located in the V1/V2, V3 and V4 regions, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14). Here we have examined two of the new antibodies, directed to the CD4-binding site and the V3 region (3BNC117 and 10-1074, respectively), for their ability to block infection and suppress viraemia in macaques infected with the R5 tropic simian–human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-AD8, which emulates many of the pathogenic and immunogenic properties of HIV-1 during infections of rhesus macaques15,16. Either antibody alone can potently block virus acquisition. When administered individually to recently infected macaques, the 10-1074 antibody caused a rapid decline in virus load to undetectable levels for 4–7 days, followed by virus rebound during which neutralization-resistant variants became detectable. When administered together, a single treatment rapidly suppressed plasma viraemia for 3–5 weeks in some long-term chronically SHIV-infected animals with low CD4+ T-cell levels. A second cycle of anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibody therapy, administered to two previously treated animals, successfully controlled virus rebound. These results indicate that immunotherapy or a combination of immunotherapy plus conventional antiretroviral drugs might be useful as a treatment for chronically HIV-1-infected individuals experiencing immune dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1972791698,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects 15-30% of children and approximately 5% of adults in industrialized countries. Although the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is not fully understood, the disease is mediated by an abnormal immunoglobulin-E immune response in the setting of skin barrier dysfunction. Mast cells contribute to immunoglobulin-E-mediated allergic disorders including atopic dermatitis. Upon activation, mast cells release their membrane-bound cytosolic granules leading to the release of several molecules that are important in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and host defence. More than 90% of patients with atopic dermatitis are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus in the lesional skin whereas most healthy individuals do not harbour the pathogen. Several staphylococcal exotoxins can act as superantigens and/or antigens in models of atopic dermatitis. However, the role of these staphylococcal exotoxins in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we report that culture supernatants of S. aureus contain potent mast-cell degranulation activity. Biochemical analysis identified δ-toxin as the mast cell degranulation-inducing factor produced by S. aureus. Mast cell degranulation induced by δ-toxin depended on phosphoinositide 3-kinase and calcium (Ca(2+)) influx; however, unlike that mediated by immunoglobulin-E crosslinking, it did not require the spleen tyrosine kinase. In addition, immunoglobulin-E enhanced δ-toxin-induced mast cell degranulation in the absence of antigen. Furthermore, S. aureus isolates recovered from patients with atopic dermatitis produced large amounts of δ-toxin. Skin colonization with S. aureus, but not a mutant deficient in δ-toxin, promoted immunoglobulin-E and interleukin-4 production, as well as inflammatory skin disease. Furthermore, enhancement of immunoglobulin-E production and dermatitis by δ-toxin was abrogated in Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mast-cell-deficient mice and restored by mast cell reconstitution. These studies identify δ-toxin as a potent inducer of mast cell degranulation and suggest a mechanistic link between S. aureus colonization and allergic skin disease."
https://openalex.org/W2074581967,"Data from the Kepler spacecraft and the HARPS-N ground-based spectrograph indicate that the extrasolar planet Kepler-78b has a mean density similar to that of Earth and imply that it is composed of rock and iron. A few exoplanets of about the size or mass of Earth have been discovered. Now, for the first time, both size and mass have been determined for one of them. Kepler-78b, first described in August this year, is close-in to its host star, which it orbits every 8.5 hours. Two groups have been able to exploit the closeness of planet and star to make Doppler spectroscopic measurements of the mass of Kepler-78b. The teams, led by Andrew Howard and Francesco Pepe, used different telescopes to arrive at mass estimates of 1.69 ± 0.41 and 1.86 +0.38/−0.245 Earth masses, respectively. They calculate the planet's mean density at 5.3 and 5.57 g cm−3, very similar to Earth's and consistent with an Earth-like composition of rock and iron. Recent analyses1,2,3,4 of data from the NASA Kepler spacecraft5 have established that planets with radii within 25 per cent of the Earth’s ( ) are commonplace throughout the Galaxy, orbiting at least 16.5 per cent of Sun-like stars1. Because these studies were sensitive to the sizes of the planets but not their masses, the question remains whether these Earth-sized planets are indeed similar to the Earth in bulk composition. The smallest planets for which masses have been accurately determined6,7 are Kepler-10b (1.42 ) and Kepler-36b (1.49 ), which are both significantly larger than the Earth. Recently, the planet Kepler-78b was discovered8 and found to have a radius of only 1.16 . Here we report that the mass of this planet is 1.86 Earth masses. The resulting mean density of the planet is 5.57 g cm−3, which is similar to that of the Earth and implies a composition of iron and rock."
https://openalex.org/W2117799721,"Planets with sizes between that of Earth (with radius R Earth symbol) and Neptune (about 4R Earth symbol) are now known to be common around Sun-like stars. Most such planets have been discovered through the transit technique, by which the planet's size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by the planet as it passes in front of its star. Measuring the planet's mass--and hence its density, which is a clue to its composition--is more difficult. Planets of size 2-4R Earth symbol have proved to have a wide range of densities, implying a diversity of compositions, but these measurements did not extend to planets as small as Earth. Here we report Doppler spectroscopic measurements of the mass of the Earth-sized planet Kepler-78b, which orbits its host star every 8.5 hours (ref. 6). Given a radius of 1.20 ± 0.09 R Earth symbol and a mass of 1.69 ± 0.41 R Earth symbol, the planet's mean density of 5.3 ± 1.8 g cm(-3) is similar to Earth's, suggesting a composition of rock and iron."

This study investigated structural and functional properties and interventional responses of human engineered cardiac tissues (hECTs) compared to human myocardium. Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs, >90% troponin-positive) were mixed with collagen and cultured on force-sensing elastomer devices. hECTs resembled trabecular muscle and beat spontaneously (1.18±0.48 Hz). Microstructural features and mRNA expression of cardiac-specific genes (α-MHC, SERCA2a, and ACTC1) were comparable to human myocardium. Optical mapping revealed cardiac refractoriness with loss of 1:1 capture above 3 Hz, and cycle length dependence of the action potential duration, recapitulating key features of cardiac electrophysiology. hECTs reconstituted the Frank-Starling mechanism, generating an average maximum twitch stress of 660 μN/mm2 at Lmax, approaching values in newborn human myocardium. Dose-response curves followed exponential pharmacodynamics models for calcium chloride (EC50 1.8 mM) and verapamil (IC50 0.61 μM); isoproterenol elicited a positive chronotropic but negligible inotropic response, suggesting sarcoplasmic reticulum immaturity. hECTs were amenable to gene transfer, demonstrated by successful transduction with Ad.GFP. Such 3-D hECTs recapitulate an early developmental stage of human myocardium and promise to offer an alternative preclinical model for cardiology research.—Turnbull, I. C., Karakikes, I., Serrao, G.

https://openalex.org/W2125670808,"The coupling of electrons to matter is at the heart of our understanding of material properties such as electrical conductivity. One of the most intriguing effects is that electron-phonon coupling can lead to the formation of a Cooper pair out of two repelling electrons, the basis for BCS superconductivity. Here we study the interaction of a single localized electron with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and show that it can excite phonons and eventually set the whole condensate into a collective oscillation. We find that the coupling is surprisingly strong as compared to ionic impurities due to the more favorable mass ratio. The electron is held in place by a single charged ionic core forming a Rydberg bound state. This Rydberg electron is described by a wavefunction extending to a size comparable to the dimensions of the BEC, namely up to 8 micrometers. In such a state, corresponding to a principal quantum number of n=202, the Rydberg electron is interacting with several tens of thousands of condensed atoms contained within its orbit. We observe surprisingly long lifetimes and finite size effects due to the electron exploring the wings of the BEC. Based on our results we anticipate future experiments on electron wavefunction imaging, investigation of phonon mediated coupling of single electrons, and applications in quantum optics."
https://openalex.org/W2006132787,"A uniform iron abundance in the intracluster gas of the Perseus cluster suggests that the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium occurred before the cluster formed, probably more than ten billion years ago, rather than after the cluster formed. Most of the metals (elements heavier than helium) produced by stars in the member galaxies of clusters are found in the hot, X-ray-emitting gas between the galaxies. If the metals are uniformly distributed, then they likely were put in place early in the cluster's history. The alternative, where metals appear after cluster formation, is expected to introduce significant spatial variation of metallicity. To test the early enrichment model by eliminating the effects of potential inhomogeneities, it is necessary to measure abundances out to large radii along multiple directions in clusters. Norbert Werner et al. have done just that on a data set of 86 measurements in the Perseus cluster. They find an iron abundance of ZFe = 0.306, which is remarkably uniform as a function of radius and azimuth right to the edge of the cluster. This distribution requires that most of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium occurred during the period of maximal star formation and black hole activity, more than 10 billion years ago. Most of the metals (elements heavier than helium) produced by stars in the member galaxies of clusters currently reside within the hot, X-ray-emitting intra-cluster gas. Observations of X-ray line emission from this intergalactic medium have suggested a relatively small cluster-to-cluster scatter outside the cluster centres1,2 and enrichment with iron out to large radii3,4,5, leading to the idea that the metal enrichment occurred early in the history of the Universe3. Models with early enrichment predict a uniform metal distribution at large radii in clusters, whereas those with late-time enrichment6,7 are expected to introduce significant spatial variations of the metallicity. To discriminate clearly between these competing models, it is essential to test for potential inhomogeneities by measuring the abundances out to large radii along multiple directions in clusters, which has not hitherto been done. Here we report a remarkably uniform iron abundance, as a function of radius and azimuth, that is statistically consistent with a constant value of ZFe = 0.306 ± 0.012 in solar units out to the edge of the nearby Perseus cluster. This homogeneous distribution requires that most of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium occurred before the cluster formed, probably more than ten billion years ago, during the period of maximal star formation and black hole activity."
https://openalex.org/W2071197565,"Phytochromes are highly versatile photoreceptors, which occur ubiquitously in plants as well as in many light-responsive microorganisms. Here, photosynthetic cyanobacteria utilize up to three different phytochrome architectures, where only the plant-like and the single-domain cyanobacteriochromes are structurally characterized so far. Cph2 represents a third group in Synechocystis species and affects their capability of phototaxis by controlling c-di-GMP synthesis and degradation. The 2.6-Å crystal structure of its red/far-red responsive photosensory module in the Pr state reveals a tandem-GAF bidomain that lacks the figure-of-eight knot of the plant/cph1 subfamily. Its covalently attached phycocyanobilin chromophore adopts a highly tilted ZZZssa conformation with a novel set of interactions between its propionates and the GAF1 domain. The tongue-like protrusion from the GAF2 domain interacts with the GAF1-bound chromophore via its conserved PRXSF, WXE, and W(G/A)G motifs. Mutagenesis showed that the integrity of the tongue is indispensable for Pr → Pfr photoconversion and involves a swap of the motifs' tryptophans within the tongue-GAF1 interface. This ""Trp switch"" is supposed to be a crucial element for the photochromicity of all multidomain phytochromes."

The advent of next-generation sequencing technology offers an unprecedented platform for rapid sequencing-based identification of novel viruses. We have developed a customized bioinformatics data analysis pipeline, VirusHunter, for the analysis of Roche/454 and other long read Next generation sequencing platform data. To illustrate the utility of VirusHunter, we performed Roche/454 GS FLX titanium sequencing on two unclassified virus isolates from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA). VirusHunter identified sequences derived from a novel bunyavirus and a novel reovirus in the two samples respectively. Further sequence analysis demonstrated that the viruses were novel members of the Phlebovirus and Orbivirus genera.

https://openalex.org/W2066532619,"The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) based techniques have become essential for gene expression studies and high-throughput molecular characterization of transgenic events. Normalizing to reference gene in relative quantification make results from qPCR more reliable when compared to absolute quantification, but requires robust reference genes. Since, ideal reference gene should be species specific, no single internal control gene is universal for use as a reference gene across various plant developmental stages and diverse growth conditions. Here, we present validation studies of multiple stably expressed reference genes in cultivated peanut with minimal variations in temporal and spatial expression when subjected to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Stability in the expression of eight candidate reference genes including ADH3, ACT11, ATPsyn, CYP2, ELF1B, G6PD, LEC and UBC1 was compared in diverse peanut plant samples. The samples were categorized into distinct experimental sets to check the suitability of candidate genes for accurate and reliable normalization of gene expression using qPCR. Stability in expression of the references genes in eight sets of samples was determined by geNorm and NormFinder methods. While three candidate reference genes including ADH3, G6PD and ELF1B were identified to be stably expressed across experiments, LEC was observed to be the least stable, and hence must be avoided for gene expression studies in peanut. Inclusion of the former two genes gave sufficiently reliable results; nonetheless, the addition of the third reference gene ELF1B may be potentially better in a diverse set of tissue samples of peanut."

However, BMP-2 delivery in a conventional collagen scaffold necessitates a high dose to achieve an efficacious outcome. To lower its effective dose, we precomplexed BMP-2 with the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate (DS) or heparin (HP), prior to loading it into a hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel. In vitro release studies showed that BMP-2 precomplexed with DS or HP had a prolonged delivery compared to without GAG. BMP-2-DS complexes achieved a slightly faster release in the first 24 h than HP; however, both delivered BMP-2 for an equal duration. Analysis of the kinetic interaction between BMP-2 and DS or HP showed that HP had approximately 10 times higher affinity for BMP-2 than DS, yet it equally stabilized the protein, as determined by alkaline phosphatase activity. Ectopic bone formation assays at subcutaneous sites in rats demonstrated that HA hydrogel-delivered BMP-2 precomplexed with GAG induced twice the volume of bone compared with BMP-2 delivered uncomplexed to GAG."
https://openalex.org/W2073126167,"Blocking the androgen receptor (AR) activity is the main goal of therapies for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). However, relapse with a more aggressive, hormone refractory PCa arises, which harbors restored AR activity. One mechanism of such reactivation occurs through acquisition of AR mutations that enable its activation by various steroidal and non-steroidal structures. Thus, natural and chemical compounds that contribute to inappropriate (androgen-independent) activation of the AR become an area of intensive research. Here, we demonstrate that genistein, a soy phytoestrogen binds to both the wild and the Thr877Ala (T877A) mutant types of AR competitively with androgen, nevertheless, it exerts a pleiotropic effect on PCa cell proliferation and AR activity depending on the mutational status of the AR. Genistein inhibited, in a dose-dependent way, cell proliferation and AR nuclear localization and expression in LAPC-4 cells that have wild AR. However, in LNCaP cells that express the T877A mutant AR, genistein induced a biphasic effect where physiological doses (0.5-5 µmol/L) stimulated cell growth and increased AR expression and transcriptional activity, and higher doses induced inhibitory effects. Similar biphasic results were achieved in PC-3 cells transfected with AR mutants; T877A, W741C and H874Y. These findings suggest that genistein, at physiological concentrations, potentially act as an agonist and activate the mutant AR that can be present in advanced PCa after androgen ablation therapy."

Herein, we investigated whether GRK5 can specifically regulate the NF-κB signaling pathway in myocytes.

To identify direct and indirect EBF1 targets in fat, we undertook a combination of transcriptional profiling of EBF1-deficient adipocytes and genome-wide EBF1 location analysis. Our results indicate that many components of metabolic and inflammatory pathways are positively and directly regulated by EBF1, including PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and STAT1 signaling. Accordingly, we observed significant reduction of multiple signaling events in EBF1 knockdown cells as well as a reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipogenesis. Inflammatory signaling, gene expression, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were also significantly affected by loss of EBF1 in adipocytes, although ChIP-sequencing results suggest that these actions are indirect. We also found that EBF1 occupies some 35,000 sites in adipocytes, most of which occur in enhancers. Significantly, comparison with three other published EBF1 ChIP-sequencing data sets in B-cells reveals both gene- and cell type-specific patterns of EBF1 binding.

https://openalex.org/W2061417581,"Bone damage removal and callus formation in response to fatigue loading are essential to prevent fractures. Periostin (Postn) is a matricellular protein that mediates adaptive response of cortical bone to loading. Whether and how periostin influences damage and the injury response to fatigue remains unknown. We investigated the skeletal response of Postn-/- and Postn+/+ mice after fatigue stimulus by axial compression of their tibia. In Postn+/+ mice, cracks number and surface (CsNb, CsS) increased 1h after fatigue, with a decrease in strength compared to non-fatigued tibia. At 15 days, CsNb had started to decline, while CtTV and CtBV increased in fatigued vs non-fatigued tibia, reflecting a woven bone response that was present in 75% of the fatigued bones. Cortical porosity and remodelling also prominently increased in the fatigued tibia of Postn+/+ mice. At 30 days, paralleling a continuous removal of cortical damage, strength of the fatigued tibia was similar to the non-fatigue tibia. In Postn-/- mice, cracks were detectable even in the absence of fatigue, while the amount of collagen crosslinks and tissue hardness was decreased compared to Postn+/+. Fatigue significantly increased CsNb and CsS in Postn-/-, but was not associated with changes in CtTV and CtBV, as only 16% of the fatigued bones formed some woven bone. Cortical porosity and remodelling did not increase either after fatigue in Postn-/- , and the level of damage remained high even after 30 days. As a result, strength remained compromised in Postn-/- mice. Contrary to Postn+/+ , which osteocytic lacunae showed a change in the degree of anisotropy (DA) after fatigue, Postn-/- showed no DA change. Hence periostin appears to influence bone materials properties, damage accumulation and repair, including local modeling/remodeling processes in response to fatigue. These observations suggest that the level of periostin expression could influence the propensity to fatigue fractures."
https://openalex.org/W2091090734,"Background Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen in paediatric patients with bloodstream infections. The epidemiology of S. aureus bacteraemia, however, has not been well documented in children in South Africa. Methods A retrospective study was conducted at a children’s hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, to investigate the epidemiology of S. aureus bacteraemia from 2007-2011. The incidence, clinical presentation, risk factors, management and outcomes of methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia were compared. Results Over the five year study period, 365 episodes of S. aureus bacteraemia were identified. The annual incidence was 3.28 cases per 1000 hospital admissions. MRSA was responsible for 26% of S. aureus bacteraemia and 72% of nosocomial infections. Only six possible cases of community-acquired MRSA infections were described. MSSA bacteraemia was more likely to present as pulmonary and bone or joint infections, while bacteraemia without a source was the most common presentation with MRSA. Infants, children with malnutrition, and residents of long-term care facilities were at highest risk for MRSA bacteraemia. The overall case fatality rate for S. aureus bacteraemia was 8.8% over five years, with MRSA being the only significant risk factor for mortality. Conclusion The incidence of S. aureus bacteraemia and MRSA bacteraemia in children has remained stable over the past five years. MRSA is a predominantly nosocomial pathogen in children with S. aureus bacteraemia in Cape Town, South Africa."

Using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes, NS206 was observed to positively modulate acetylcholine (ACh)-evoked currents at both known α4β2 stoichiometries (2α:3β and 3α:2β). In the presence of NS206, peak current amplitudes surpassed those of maximal efficacious ACh stimulations (Emax(ACh)) with no or limited effects at potencies and current waveforms (as inspected visually). This pharmacological action contrasted with that of NS9283, which only modulated the 3α:2β receptor and acted by left shifting the ACh concentration-response relationship. Interestingly, the two modulators can act simultaneously in an additive manner at 3α:2β receptors, which results in current levels exceeding Emax(ACh) and a left-shifted ACh concentration-response relationship. Through use of chimeric and point-mutated receptors, the binding site of NS206 was linked to the α4-subunit transmembrane domain, whereas binding of NS9283 was shown to be associated with the αα-interface in 3α:2β receptors. Collectively, these data demonstrate the existence of two distinct modulatory sites in α4β2 receptors with unique pharmacological attributes that can act additively. Several allosteric sites have been identified within the family of Cys-loop receptors and with the present data, a detailed picture of allosteric modulatory mechanisms of these important receptors is emerging."
https://openalex.org/W2069772277,"Unlike normal differentiated cells, tumor cells metabolize glucose via glycolysis under aerobic conditions, a hallmark of cancer known as the Warburg effect. Cells lacking the commonly mutated tumor suppressor PTEN exhibit a glycolytic phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect. This has been traditionally attributed to the hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling that results from PTEN loss. Here, we propose a novel mechanism whereby the loss of PTEN negatively affects the activity of the E3 ligase APC/C-Cdh1, resulting in the stabilization of the enzyme PFKFB3 and increased synthesis of its product fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P2). We discovered that when compared with wild-type cells, PTEN knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PTEN KO MEF) have 2-3-fold higher concentrations of F2,6P2, the most potent allosteric activator of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). Reintroduction of either wild-type or phosphatase mutant PTEN in the PTEN KO cells effectively lowers F2,6P2 to the wild-type levels and reduces their lactate production. PTEN KO cells were found to have high protein levels of PFKFB3, which directly contribute to the increased concentrations of F2,6P2. PTEN enhances interaction between PFKFB3 and Cdh1, and overexpression of Cdh1 down-regulates the PFKFB3 protein level in wild-type, but not in PTEN-deficient cells. Importantly, we found that the degradation of endogenous PFKFB3 in PTEN KO cells occurs at a slower rate than in wild-type cells. Our results suggest an important role for F2,6P2 in the metabolic reprogramming of PTEN-deficient cells that has important consequences for cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2098263790,"Multiple Ca(2+)-dependent processes are involved in capsaicin-induced desensitization of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), but desensitization of TRPV1 by heat occurs even in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+), although the mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that capsaicin and heat desensitize TRPV1 through distinct mechanisms involving distinct structural segments of TRPV1. In HEK293 cells that heterologously express TRPV1, we found that heat-induced desensitization was not affected by the inclusion of intracellular ATP or alanine mutation of Lys(155), both of which attenuate capsaicin-induced desensitization, suggesting that heat-induced desensitization occurs through mechanisms distinct from capsaicin-induced desensitization. To determine protein domains involved in heat-induced desensitization, we generated chimeric proteins between TRPV1 and TRPV3, a heat-gated channel lacking heat-induced desensitization. We found that TRPV1 with the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of TRPV3 retained heat activation but was impaired in heat-induced desensitization. Further experiments using chimeric or deletion mutants within TRPV1 CTD indicated that the distal half of CTD regulates the activation and desensitization of TRPV1 in modality-specific manners. Within the distal CTD, we identified two segments that distinctly regulated capsaicin- and heat-induced desensitization. The results suggest that the activation and desensitization of TRPV1 by capsaicin and heat can be modulated differentially and disproportionally through different regions of TRPV1 CTD. Identifying the domains involved in thermal regulation of TRPV1 may facilitate the development of novel anti-hyperalgesic approaches aimed at attenuating activation and enhancing desensitization of TRPV1 by thermal stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1971562198,"Despite the initial response, all patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) eventually develop acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The EGFR-T790M secondary mutation is responsible for half of acquired resistance cases, while MET amplification has been associated with acquired resistance in about 5-15% of NSCLCs. Clinical findings indicate the retained addiction of resistant tumors on EGFR signaling. Therefore, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms supporting the therapeutic potential of gefitinib maintenance in the HCC827 GR5 NSCLC cell line harbouring MET amplification as acquired resistance mechanism. We demonstrated that resistant cells can proliferate and survive regardless of the presence of gefitinib, whereas the absence of the drug significantly enhanced cell migration and invasion. Moreover, the continuous exposure to gefitinib prevented the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) with increased E-cadherin expression and down-regulation of vimentin and N-cadherin. Importantly, the inhibition of cellular migration was correlated with the suppression of EGFR-dependent Src, STAT5 and p38 signaling as assessed by a specific kinase array, western blot analysis and silencing functional studies. On the contrary, the lack of effect of gefitinib on EGFR phosphorylation in the H1975 cells (EGFR-T790M) correlated with the absence of effects on cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that certain EGFR-mutated patients may still benefit from a second-line therapy including gefitinib based on the specific mechanism underlying tumor cell resistance."

Here, we show that the cyclization and active site loops of MCoTI-II are flexible in solution, but when bound to trypsin, the active site loop converges to a single well defined conformation. This finding of reduced flexibility on binding is in contrast to a recent study on the homologous peptide MCoTI-I, which suggested that regions of the peptide are more flexible upon binding to trypsin. We provide a possible explanation for this discrepancy based on degradation of the complex over time.

https://openalex.org/W2093615108,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are a promising means for restoring communication to patients suffering from ""locked-in"" syndrome. Research to improve system performance primarily focuses on means to overcome the low signal to noise ratio of electroencephalogric (EEG) recordings. However, the literature and methods are difficult to compare due to the array of evaluation metrics and assumptions underlying them, including that: 1) all characters are equally probable, 2) character selection is memoryless, and 3) errors occur completely at random. The standardization of evaluation metrics that more accurately reflect the amount of information contained in BCI language output is critical to make progress. We present a mutual information-based metric that incorporates prior information and a model of systematic errors. The parameters of a system used in one study were re-optimized, showing that the metric used in optimization significantly affects the parameter values chosen and the resulting system performance. The results of 11 BCI communication studies were then evaluated using different metrics, including those previously used in BCI literature and the newly advocated metric. Six studies' results varied based on the metric used for evaluation and the proposed metric produced results that differed from those originally published in two of the studies. Standardizing metrics to accurately reflect the rate of information transmission is critical to properly evaluate and compare BCI communication systems and advance the field in an unbiased manner."
https://openalex.org/W1981630052,"Decorin, the prototypical small leucine-rich proteoglycan, binds to collagen and thereby regulates collagen assembly into fibrils. The crystal structure of the decorin core protein revealed a tight dimer formed by the association of two monomers via their concave faces (Scott, P. G., McEwan, P. A., Dodd, C. M., Bergmann, E. M., Bishop, P. N., and Bella, J. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101, 15633-15638). Whether decorin binds collagen as a dimer has been controversial. Using analytical ultracentrifugation, we determined a dissociation constant of 1.37 ± 0.30 μm for the mouse decorin dimer. Dimerization could be abolished by engineering glycosylation sites into the dimer interface; other interface mutants remained dimeric. The monomeric mutants were as stable as wild-type decorin in thermal unfolding experiments. Mutations on the concave face of decorin abolished collagen binding regardless of whether the mutant proteins retained the ability to dimerize or not. We conclude that the concave face of decorin mediates collagen binding and that the dimer therefore must dissociate to bind collagen."

This process is catalyzed by peroxidases at the expense of H2O2 and confers physical and biological protection to the developing embryo.

Although chorion hardening of Aedes aegypti eggs takes place only after oviposition (2Li J.S. Li J.

Similar to what happens with the body wall cuticle of all insects, the hardening of the eggshell in D. melanogaster and A. aegypti involves cross-linking of the exochorion proteins, which is accomplished by peroxidases through the oxidation of tyrosine residues and the subsequent formation of di- and trityrosine bonds between the chorion proteins, a process that requires H2O2 (4Konstandi O.A.

Resistance to water loss is thought to be an essential feature of insect eggs and probably was a key adaptation that allowed the marine ancestors of insects to invade the terrestrial environment. Immediately after oviposition, the eggs of A. aegypti are susceptible to desiccation and become waterproof only after several hours, when the serosal cuticle is formed. This layer, which is secreted below the endochorion by the serosa, surrounds the embryo (15Rezende G.L. Martins A.J. Gentile C. Farnesi L.C. Pelajo-Machado M. Peixoto A.A. Valle D.

The protocols were approved by the CAUAP-UFRJ under Registry Number IBQM001. Dedicated technicians at the animal facility at the Institute of Medical Biochemistry (UFRJ) carried out all aspects related to rabbit husbandry under strict guidelines to ensure careful and consistent handling of the animals. The salivary glands, heart, Malpighian tubules, anterior midgut, posterior midgut, hindgut, fat body, ovary, and follicular epithelia were dissected from cold-anesthetized insect females in cold Tyrode's solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.56 mm glucose, 0.32 mm NaH2PO4, 1.16 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4). A local BLAST search using the cDNA sequences of Duox, NOX5, and catalase orthologs as queries was used to identify the Duox and catalase sequences in a R. prolixus 454 transcriptome database. These partial cDNAs were used to identify the Duox (RPTMP03545), NOX5 (RPTMP07634), and catalase (RPTMP07126) full-length transcripts in the R. prolixus genome database available at VectorBase.

Total RNA was extracted from tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Fermentas International Inc., Burlington, Canada), and cDNA was synthesized using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). cDNA from salivary glands, heart, Malpighian tubules, anterior midgut, posterior midgut, hindgut, fat body, and ovary were PCR-amplified using the PCR master mix (Fermentas International Inc.), and the same primers were used for qPCR (described below). The fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (2% w/v), and their sizes were compared with GeneRulerTM 100 bp Plus DNA ladder fragments (Fermentas International Inc.). qPCR was performed on a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using the Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The comparative Ct method (22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

The R. prolixus 18 S rRNA gene was used as an endogenous control (23Majerowicz D. Alves-Bezerra M. Logullo R. Fonseca-de-Souza A.L. Meyer-Fernandes J.R. Braz G.R. Gondim K.C.

The primer pairs used for the amplification of Duox and 18 S rRNA cDNA fragments for both conventional and real-time PCR, named DuoxRt and 18sRt, respectively, were DuoxRt, forward 5′-TTGTGTTCGCACATCCAACT-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTCCAACGAAAAATATCCAAA-3′; 18SRt, forward, 5′-TGTCGGTGTAACTGGCATGT-3 and reverse, 5′-TCGGCCAACAAAAGTACACA-3′. Measurement of H2O2 production by whole ovaries or by dissected follicular epithelia was performed by incubating tissues for 60 min at 25 °C in Tyrode's solution with 40 μm Amplex Red and 0.08 units/μl of horseradish peroxidase (24Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. A highly sensitive fluorescent micro-assay of H2O2 release from activated human leukocytes using a dihydroxyphenoxazine derivative.J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). After incubation, the ovaries or epithelia were spun, and the supernatant was collected. Fluorescence (excitation, 530 nm; emission, 590 nm) was measured with a microplate reader, the SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices). Because Duox activity depends on calcium, Ca2+-dependent H2O2 generation was evaluated by preincubation of the ovaries and follicular epithelia in the presence or absence of 1 μm ionomycin, 10 μm BAPTA/AM, or both for 10 min at 28 °C. Inhibition of Duox activity was achieved via preincubation with 1 μm diphenyleneiodonium. The fluorescence of nonspecific (H2O2-independent) oxidation of Amplex Red was evaluated in the absence of HRP and used as a blank. A 404-bp fragment from the Duox gene and a 453-bp fragment from the catalase gene were amplified from reverse-transcribed RNAs extracted from R. prolixus ovaries using the primer pairs DuoxDs1 and CatDs1, respectively. The amplification products were subjected to nested PCR with an additional pair of primers (DuoxDs2 and CatDs2) that included the T7 promoter sequence in each fragment. The primers mentioned above were DuoxDs1, forward, 5′-ATGGGTAATCCTGCGTTGAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCGTCTTTTGATTCCAGCAT-3′; CatDs1, forward, 5′-GGAGCGTTCGGTTACTTTGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCAAGTTTCACCTCGGTCAT-3′; DuoxDs2, forward, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATGGGTAATCCTGCGTTGAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCGTCTTTTGATTCCAGCAT-3′; CatDs2, forward, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGGAGCGTTCGGTTACTTTGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGCAAGTTTCACCTCGGTCAT-3′. The nested PCRs generated 444- and 493-bp fragments of Duox and catalase, respectively. These fragments were used as a template to synthesize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific for Duox (dsDuox) and catalase (dsCat) using the MEGAscript RNAi kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. An unrelated dsRNA (dsMal) specific for the Escherichia coli MalE gene (Gene ID: 948538) was used as a control for the off-target effects of dsRNA. The Mal fragment was amplified from the Litmus 28i-mal plasmid (New England Biolabs) with a single primer (T7, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) specific for the T7 promoter sequence that is on both sides of the MalE sequence. For gene silencing experiments, cold-anesthetized adult females were injected in the hemocoel with 1 μl of sterile distilled water containing 1 mg/ml dsRNA using a 5-μl Hamilton syringe. Six days after dsRNA injection, the insects were fed with rabbit blood. After a blood meal, the females were individually separated into vials and kept at 28 °C and 75% relative humidity. After completion of oviposition, the number of eggs laid by each female was counted. The eclosion ratios were calculated by dividing the number of hatched first instar nymphs by the number of eggs laid by each female. Eggshells were photographed after eclosion with an Olympus MVX10 macroview fluorescence microscope equipped with a Olympus DP-72 color CCD camera without filters, an external LED white light source for bright field imaging, and a filter set for dityrosine fluorescence (4900 ET - DAPI - EX D350/50X; BS 400DCL; EM ET460/50Chroma). Comparison of fluorescence levels between the distinct systems was performed using the same objectives and exposure times. For fluorescence quantification, pictures of three groups of 10 eggs from control and silenced females were analyzed with ImageJ software (24Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G.

Methods. 1997; 202: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To calculate the corrected total egg fluorescence (CTEF), we used the following formula: CTEF = integrated density − (area of selected egg × mean fluorescence of background readings). Egg chorion obtained from newly laid eggs was subjected to acid hydrolysis to evaluate its dityrosine content using the procedure described by Malencik et al. (25Malencik D.A. Sprouse J.F. Swanson C.A. Anderson S.R. Dityrosine: preparation, isolation, and analysis.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), with some modifications. In three independent experiments, pools of 20 eggs laid by 10 dsMal- or dsDuox-injected females were transferred to 1-ml polypropylene tubes containing 1% Triton X-100 in distilled water, homogenized, sonicated for 10 min, and washed 10 times with distilled water. After sedimentation, chorion fragments were collected, dried under a vacuum, and added to 6 n HCl. The samples were hydrolyzed for 24 h at 110 °C under a vacuum and then dried under a vacuum, resuspended in distilled water, and filtered on Amicon filters (10-kDa cutoff). After being dried under a vacuum, the samples were resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 9.6. For standard dityrosine preparation, 2 mg of tyrosine and 80 μg of horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) were added to 2 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.2, containing 0.005% H2O2. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction medium was filtered on Amicon filters (10-kDa cutoff) to remove horseradish peroxidase and dried under a vacuum. The samples were then resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 9.6. Fluorescence excitation spectra (excitation, 280–360 nm; emission, 410 nm) were measured with a Cary Eclipse 100 spectrofluorometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Crude eggshell hydrolysate is a complex mixture of substances. To circumvent this problem and gain specificity, the spectra of crude hydrolysate from dsMal samples were subtracted from the spectra of dsDuox samples, a procedure that resulted in a spectral profile that reflected only the differences between the two samples. All experiments were repeated at least twice. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test with a 95% confidence interval or a one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons post test (GraphPad Prism). The presence of a Duox-type NADPH oxidase, initially found in a transcriptome, was confirmed by identification of a complete predicted transcript in the R. prolixus genome, hereafter called RpDuox. Fig. 1A shows the characteristic peroxidase-like, EF-hand, and NOX domains of RpDuox, which are conserved among all Duox orthologs. A multiple sequence alignment of the RpDuox protein sequence against A. pisum, A. gambiae, and D. melanogaster Duox sequences showed a remarkable conservation (see Fig. 6). Phylogenetic analysis provided further support for the identification of RpDuox, which clustered with other members of the Duox group (Fig. 1B). Additionally, the Duox and NOX5 branches that were obtained were consistent with known arthropod evolutionary relationships (Fig. 1B), including insects arising from Crustacea (26Regier J.C.

RpDuox expression in the ovary increased after a blood meal (Fig. 2B), paralleling the time course of oocyte growth in this insect (28Oliveira P.L. Gondim K.C. Guedes D.M. Masuda H. Uptake of yolk proteins in Rhodnius prolixus.J. Insect. Physiol. 1986; 32: 859-866Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Evaluation by qPCR of RpDuox mRNA in ovarian follicles at distinct developmental stages revealed that the highest expression levels were found in the epithelium of choriogenic follicles and were almost 10 times higher than those in the epithelia from follicles that either were at the vitellogenic growth stage or had already completed chorion formation (Fig. 2C). Duox enzymes are calcium-dependent NADPH oxidases due to the presence of the EF-hand domain (14Donkó A. Péterfi Z. Sum A. Leto T. Geiszt M. Dual oxidases.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 2301-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When ovaries dissected from blood-fed females were incubated in the presence of ionomycin, a calcium ionophore that increases intracellular levels of Ca2+, H2O2 production by this tissue was markedly stimulated (Fig. 2D). Preincubation of ovaries with diphenyleneiodonium (an NADPH oxidase inhibitor) or BAPTA/AM (an intracellular Ca2+ chelator) prevented this ionomycin-induced increase in H2O2 production, consistent with the presence of a Duox-type enzyme in this tissue (29Ellis J.A. Mayer S.J. Jones O.T. The effect of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium on aerobic and anaerobic microbicidal activities of human neutrophils.Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As expected from the increased expression of RpDuox mRNA during chorion formation (Fig. 2C), we observed increased ionomycin-stimulated H2O2 production in the follicular epithelium during this developmental stage (Fig. 2E), suggesting that this enzyme participates in choriogenesis. To investigate the function of RpDuox in the ovaries of R. prolixus, we silenced its expression by injecting dsRNA for this gene into the hemocoel of females prior to the blood meal. dsRNA injection reduced Duox mRNA levels in the ovaries by ∼70% in relation to control females. Efficient silencing was achieved before the blood meal and was maintained until 1 week after the blood meal (ABM), with RpDuox expression returning to levels similar to the control near the end of oogenesis, 2 weeks ABM (Fig. 3A). RpDuox silencing led to a significant reduction of Duox activity in the ovaries (Fig. 3B), modestly reduced the number of eggs laid, and markedly decreased the first instar nymph eclosion ratio (Fig. 3, C and D). Upon RpDuox silencing, a major fraction of the eggs dried out in the first 48 h after oviposition and did not develop (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the permeability barrier of the eggshell was compromised. This conclusion was confirmed by incubating RpDuox-silenced eggs in a high humidity atmosphere, which resulted in eclosion rates similar to those of control eggs (Fig. 3, F and G). The hardening of the eggshell is known to involve protein cross-linking through peroxidase-mediated oxidation of tyrosine residues (5Li J. Hodgeman B.A. Christensen B.M. Involvement of peroxidase in chorion hardening in Aedes aegypti.Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which led us to speculate that RpDuox might be the source of the H2O2 used in eggshell formation. Consistent with this hypothesis, silencing of RpDuox resulted in the formation of eggshells that showed markedly reduced fluorescence emission under ultraviolet excitation (Fig. 4, A and B), a property of dityrosine formed by oxidative protein cross-linking (30Neff D. Frazier S.F. Quimby L. Wang R.T. Zill S. Identification of resilin in the leg of cockroach, Periplaneta americana: confirmation by a simple method using pH dependence of UV fluorescence.Arthropod.

To confirm that this difference in fluorescence was due to a distinct dityrosine content, we subjected eggshells from silenced or control eggs to acid hydrolysis. The fluorescence excitation wavelength spectrum obtained from dsMal sample was subtracted from the dsDuox sample, showing a differential spectrum close to that of standard dityrosine (Fig. 4C). The role of RpDuox in generating H2O2 during chorion formation was further confirmed by reversing the effect of RpDuox silencing by manipulating H2O2 levels in the insect, either by injecting H2O2 or by injecting dsRNA for catalase together with dsRNA for"
https://openalex.org/W2108053177,"O-GlcNAcylation on serine/threonine is a post-translational modification that controls the activity of nucleocytoplasmic proteins according to glucose availability. We previously showed that O-GlcNAcylation of FoxO1 in liver cells increases its transcriptional activity. In the present study, we evaluated the potential involvement of FoxO1 O-GlcNAcylation in the context of pancreatic β-cell glucotoxicity. FoxO1 was O-GlcNAcylated in INS-1 832/13 β cells and isolated rat pancreatic islets. O-GlcNAcylation of FoxO1 resulted in a 2-fold increase in its transcriptional activity toward a FoxO1 reporter gene and a 3-fold increase in the expression of the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (Igfbp1) gene at the mRNA level, resulting in IGFBP1 protein oversecretion by the cells. Of note, increased IGFBP1 in the culture medium inhibited the activity of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)/phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. We reveal in this report a novel mechanism by which O-GlcNAcylation inhibits Akt activity through an autocrine mechanism. However, although inhibition of IGFBP1 expression using siRNA restored the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway, it did not rescue INS-1 832/13 cells from high-glucose- or O-glcNAcylation-induced cell death. In contrast, FoxO1 down-regulation by siRNA led to 30 to 60% protection of INS-1 832/13 cells from death mediated by glucotoxic conditions. Therefore, whereas FoxO1 O-GlcNAcylation inhibits Akt through an IGFBP1-mediated autocrine pathway, the deleterious effects of FoxO1 O-GlcNAcylation on cell survival appeared to be independent of this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1980894737,"Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is essential to the control of metabolic fuel homeostasis. The impairment of GSIS is a key element of β-cell failure and one of causes of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although the KATP channel-dependent mechanism of GSIS has been broadly accepted for several decades, it does not fully describe the effects of glucose on insulin secretion. Emerging evidence has suggested that other mechanisms are involved. The present study demonstrated that geniposide enhanced GSIS in response to the stimulation of low or moderately high concentrations of glucose, and promoted glucose uptake and intracellular ATP levels in INS-1 cells. However, in the presence of a high concentration of glucose, geniposide exerted a contrary role on both GSIS and glucose uptake and metabolism. Furthermore, geniposide improved the impairment of GSIS in INS-1 cells challenged with a high concentration of glucose. Further experiments showed that geniposide modulated pyruvate carboxylase expression and the production of intermediates of glucose metabolism. The data collectively suggest that geniposide has potential to prevent or improve the impairment of insulin secretion in β-cells challenged with high concentrations of glucose, likely through pyruvate carboxylase mediated glucose metabolism in β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2139296837,"Due to human impact, there is extensive degradation and loss of marine habitats, which calls for measures that incorporate taxonomic as well as functional and trophic aspects of biodiversity. Since such data is less easily quantifiable in nature, the use of habitats as surrogates or proxies for biodiversity is on the rise in marine conservation and management. However, there is a critical gap in knowledge of whether pre-defined habitat units adequately represent the functional and trophic structure of communities. We also lack comparisons of different measures of community structure in terms of both between- (β) and within-habitat (α) variability when accounting for species densities. Thus, we evaluated a priori defined coastal habitats as surrogates for traditional taxonomic, functional and trophic zoobenthic community structure. We focused on four habitats (bare sand, canopy-forming algae, seagrass above- and belowground), all easily delineated in nature and defined through classification systems. We analyzed uni- and multivariate data on species and trait diversity as well as stable isotope ratios of benthic macrofauna. A good fit between habitat types and taxonomic and functional structure was found, although habitats were more similar functionally. This was attributed to within-habitat heterogeneity so when habitat divisions matched the taxonomic structure, only bare sand was functionally distinct. The pre-defined habitats did not meet the variability of trophic structure, which also proved to differentiate on a smaller spatial scale. The quantification of trophic structure using species density only identified an epi- and an infaunal unit. To summarize the results we present a conceptual model illustrating the match between pre-defined habitat types and the taxonomic, functional and trophic community structure. Our results show the importance of including functional and trophic aspects more comprehensively in marine management and spatial planning."

Recent studies have described elevated levels of membrane attack complex (MAC) and reduced levels of membrane associated complement regulators including CD55 and CD59 in the retina of diabetic retinopathy patients as well as in animal models of this disease. We have previously described the development of a soluble membrane-independent form of CD59 (sCD59) that when delivered via a gene therapy approach using an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV2/8-sCD59) to the eyes of mice, can block MAC deposition and choroidal neovascularization. Here, we examine AAV2/8-sCD59 mediated attenuation of MAC deposition and ensuing complement mediated damage to the retina of mice following streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes. We observed a 60% reduction in leakage of retinal blood vessels in diabetic eyes pre-injected with AAV2/8-sCD59 relative to negative control virus injected diabetic eyes. AAV2/8-sCD59 injected eyes also exhibited protection from non-perfusion of retinal blood vessels. In addition, a 200% reduction in retinal ganglion cell apoptosis and a 40% reduction in MAC deposition were documented in diabetic eyes pre-injected with AAV2/8-sCD59 relative to diabetic eyes pre-injected with the control virus. This is the first study characterizing a viral gene therapy intervention that targets MAC in a model of diabetic retinopathy. Use of AAV2/8-sCD59 warrants further exploration as a potential therapy for advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy."

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is detected in all undifferentiated type of NPC in this endemic region. Establishment of stable and latent EBV infection in premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cells is an early event in NPC development and may contribute to its pathogenesis. Immortalized primary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells represent an important tool for investigation of EBV infection and its tumorigenic potential in this special type of epithelial cells. However, the limited availability and small sizes of nasopharyngeal biopsies have seriously restricted the establishment of primary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells for immortalization. A reliable and effective method to immortalize primary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells will provide unrestricted materials for EBV infection studies. An earlier study has reported that Bmi-1 expression could immortalize primary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. However, its efficiency and actions in immortalization have not been fully characterized. Our studies showed that Bmi-1 expression alone has limited ability to immortalize primary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and additional events are often required for its immortalization action. We have identified some of the key events associated with the immortalization of primary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Efficient immortalization of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells could be reproducibly and efficiently achieved by the combined actions of Bmi-1 expression, activation of telomerase and silencing of p16 gene. Activation of MAPK signaling and gene expression downstream of Bmi-1 were detected in the immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and may play a role in immortalization. Furthermore, these newly immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cells are susceptible to EBV infection and supported a type II latent EBV infection program characteristic of EBV-infected nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The establishment of an efficient method to immortalize primary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells will facilitate the investigation into the role of EBV infection in pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1975733683,"Extracellular RNA (eRNA) released under injury or pathological conditions has been identified as a yet unrecognized vascular alarm signal to induce procoagulant, permeability-promoting, and proinflammatory activities. eRNA-induced functions were largely prevented by administration of RNase1 as a natural blood vessel-protective antagonist of eRNA. The aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory regulation of endothelial cell RNase1, which is partly stored in Weibel-Palade bodies of these cells. Long-term treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with inflammatory agents like tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) or interleukin 1β (IL-1β), but not with eRNA, significantly decreased the release (34 ± 5%; 34 ± 7% of control) as well as the cellular expression (19.5 ± 5%; 33 ± 8% of control) of RNase1. Down-regulation of RNase1 by TNF-α stimulation or RNase1 siRNA knockdown increased the permeability of HUVEC monolayers, demonstrated by dearrangement of VE-cadherins at cell-cell borders. Mechanistically, cytokine-induced decrease of RNase1 expression did not involve the nuclear factor κ B (NFκB) signaling pathway but epigenic modifications. Since inhibition of histone deacetylases resulted in recovery of RNase1 expression and secretion after cytokine treatment, an acetylation-dependent process of RNase1 regulation is proposed. These results indicate that cytokine-mediated down-regulation of RNase1 in endothelial cells may aggravate eRNA-induced inflammatory activities and thereby disturbs the vascular homeostasis of the extracellular RNA/RNase system."
https://openalex.org/W2028228697,"Post-translational modifications with ubiquitin-like proteins require three sequentially acting enzymes (E1, E2, and E3) that must unambiguously recognize each other in a coordinated fashion to achieve their functions. Although a single E2 (UBC9) and few RING-type E3s (PIAS) operate in the SUMOylation system, the molecular determinants regulating the interactions between UBC9 and the RING-type E3 enzymes are still not well defined. In this study we use biochemical and functional experiments to characterize the interactions between PIAS1 and UBC9. Our results reveal that UBC9 and PIAS1 are engaged both in a canonical E2·E3 interaction as well as assembled into a previously unidentified non-covalent ternary complex with SUMO as evidenced by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry studies. In this ternary complex, SUMO functions as a bridge by forming non-overlapping interfaces with UBC9 and PIAS1. Moreover, our data suggest that phosphorylation of serine residues adjacent to the PIAS1 SUMO-interacting motif favors formation of the non covalent PIAS1·SUMO·UBC9 ternary complex. Finally, our results also indicate that the non-covalent ternary complex is required for the known transcriptional repression activities mediated by UBC9 and SUMO1. Taken together, the data enhance our knowledge concerning the mode of interaction of enzymes of the SUMOylation machinery as well as their role in transcriptional regulation and establishes a framework for investigations of other ubiquitin-like protein systems."
https://openalex.org/W2029021684,"A common observation in different plant species is a massive abscission of flowers and fruitlets even after adequate pollination, but little is known as to the reason for this drop. Previous research has shown the importance of nutritive reserves accumulated in the flower on fertilization success and initial fruit development but direct evidence has been elusive. Avocado (Persea americana) is an extreme case of a species with a very low fruit to flower ratio. In this work, the implications of starch content in the avocado flower on the subsequent fruit set are explored. Firstly, starch content in individual ovaries was analysed from two populations of flowers with a different fruit set capacity showing that the flowers from the population that resulted in a higher percentage of fruit set contained significantly more starch. Secondly, in a different set of flowers, the style of each flower was excised one day after pollination, once the pollen tubes had reached the base of the style, and individually fixed for starch content analysis under the microscope once the fate of its corresponding ovary (that remained in the tree) was known. A high variability in starch content in the style was found among flowers, with some flowers having starch content up to 1,000 times higher than others, and the flowers that successfully developed into fruits presented significantly higher starch content in the style at anthesis than those that abscised. The relationship between starch content in the ovary and the capacity of set of the flower together with the correlation found between the starch content in the style and the fate of the ovary support the hypothesis that the carbohydrate reserves accumulated in the flower at anthesis are related to subsequent abscission or retention of the developing fruit."
https://openalex.org/W2042721838,"Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited arrhythmogenic syndrome leading to sudden cardiac death, partially associated with autosomal dominant mutations in SCN5A, which encodes the cardiac sodium channel alpha-subunit (Nav1.5). To date some SCN5A mutations related with BrS have been identified in voltage sensor of Nav1.5. Here, we describe a dominant missense mutation (R1629Q) localized in the fourth segment of domain IV region (DIV-S4) in a Chinese Han family. The mutation was identified by direct sequencing of SCN5A from the proband's DNA. Co-expression of Wild-type (WT) or R1629Q Nav1.5 channel and hβ1 subunit were achieved in human embryonic kidney cells by transient transfection. Sodium currents were recorded using whole cell patch-clamp protocols. No significant changes between WT and R1629Q currents were observed in current density or steady-state activation. However, hyperpolarized shift of steady-state inactivation curve was identified in cells expressing R1629Q channel (WT: V1/2 = -81.1 ± 1.3 mV, n = 13; R1629Q: V1/2 = -101.7 ± 1.2 mV, n = 18). Moreover, R1629Q channel showed enhanced intermediate inactivation and prolonged recovery time from inactivation. In summary, this study reveals that R1629Q mutation causes a distinct loss-of-function of the channel due to alter its electrophysiological characteristics, and facilitates our understanding of biophysical mechanisms of BrS."

However, little is known of intraspecific sensitivities and the potential role of local genetic adaptation of populations. We compared the allelochemical sensitivity of 23 Pediastrum duplex Meyen strains, a common component of the freshwater phytoplankton. In order to test for local genetic adaptation, strains were isolated from water bodies with and without the allelopathically-active submerged macrophyte Myriophyllum. Strains were assigned to P. duplex on the basis of cell shape and colony morphology and only P. duplex strains that belonged to the same lineage in an ITS rDNA phylogeny were used. Inhibition of strain growth rates and maximum quantum yields of photosystem II were measured after exposure to tannic acid (TA) and co-culture with Myriophyllum spicatum. Growth rate inhibition varied over one order of magnitude between the P. duplex strains. There was no correlation between the presence of Myriophyllum in the source location and the sensitivity of the strains to TA or the presence of Myriophyllum, suggesting that at least strong unidirectional local adaptation to Myriophyllum had not taken place in the studied water bodies. The maximum quantum yield of photosystem II of TA exposed algae decreased, whereas the yield of algae exposed to M. spicatum was slightly higher than that of the controls. The ranking of P. duplex strain sensitivities differed between the types of exposure (single additions of TA versus co-existence with M. spicatum) and the parameter measured (growth rate versus maximum quantum yield), emphasizing the importance of measuring multiple traits when analysing strain-specific sensitivities towards allelochemicals. The observation that sensitivities to allelochemicals vary widely among strains of a single freshwater algal species should be taken into account if evaluating ecological consequences of allelopathic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2164987643,"Seed storage proteins in wheat endosperm, particularly high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS), are primary determinants of dough properties, and affect both end-use quality and grain utilization of wheat (Triticum aestivum L). In order to investigate the interactive effects between the transgenically overexpressed 1Ax1 subunit with different HMW-GS on dough quality traits, we developed a set of 8 introgression lines (ILs) overexpressing the transgenic HMW-glutenin subunit 1Ax1 by introgression of this transgene from transgenic line B102-1-2/1 into an elite Chinese wheat variety Chuanmai107 (C107), using conventional crossing and backcrossing breeding technique. The donor C107 strain lacks 1Ax1 but contains the HMW-GS pairs 1Dx2+1Dy12 and 1Bx7+1By9. The resultant ILs showed robust and stable expression of 1Ax1 even after five generations of self-pollination, and crossing/backcrossing three times. In addition, overexpression of 1Ax1 was compensated by the endogenous gluten proteins. All ILs exhibited superior agronomic performance when compared to the transgenic parent line, B102-1-2/1. Mixograph results demonstrated that overexpressed 1Ax1 significantly improved dough strength, resistance to extension and over-mixing tolerance, in the targeted wheat cultivar C107. Further, comparisons among the ILs showed the interactive effects of endogenous subunits on dough properties when 1Ax1 was overexpressed: subunit pair 17+18 contributed to increased over-mixing tolerance of the dough; expression of the Glu-D1 allele maintained an appropriate balance between x-type and y-type subunits and thereby improved dough quality. It is consistent with ILs C4 (HMW-GS are 1, 17+18, 2+12) had the highest gluten index and Zeleny sedimentation value. This study demonstrates that wheat quality could be improved by using transgenic wheat overexpressing HMW-GS and the feasibility of using such transgenic lines in wheat quality breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2069579179,"Fission yeast, Schizoaccharomyces pombe, is a model for studying cellular quiescence. Shifting to a medium that lacks a nitrogen-source induces proliferative cells to enter long-term G0 quiescence. Klf1 is a Krüppel-like transcription factor with a 7-amino acid Cys2His2-type zinc finger motif. The deletion mutant, ∆klf1, normally divides in vegetative medium, but proliferation is not restored after long-term G0 quiescence. Cell biologic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses revealed a unique phenotype of the ∆klf1 mutant in quiescence. Mutant cells had diminished transcripts related to signaling molecules for switching to differentiation; however, proliferative metabolites for cell-wall assembly and antioxidants had significantly increased. Further, the size of ∆klf1 cells increased markedly during quiescence due to the aberrant accumulation of Calcofluor-positive, chitin-like materials beneath the cell wall. After 4 weeks of quiescence, reversible proliferation ability was lost, but metabolism was maintained. Klf1 thus plays a role in G0 phase longevity by enhancing the differentiation signal and suppressing metabolism for growth. If Klf1 is lost, S. pombe fails to maintain a constant cell size and normal cell morphology during quiescence."
https://openalex.org/W2065797452,"Vertebrate hosts often defend themselves against several co-infecting parasite genotypes simultaneously. This has important implications for the ecological dynamics and the evolution of host defence systems and parasite strategies. For example, it can drive the specificity of the adaptive immune system towards high genotype-specificity or cross-reactivity against several parasite genotypes depending on the sequence and probability of re-infections. However, to date, there is very little evidence on these interactions outside mammalian disease literature. In this study we asked whether genotype-specific or cross-reactive responses dominate in the adaptive immune system of a fish host towards a common macroparasite. In other words, we investigated if the infection success of a parasite genotype is influenced by the immunization genotype. We reciprocally immunized and re-exposed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to a range of genotypes of the trematode eye fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, and measured infection success of the parasite. We found that the infection success of the parasite genotypes in the re-exposure did not depend on the immunization genotype. While immunization reduced average infection success by 31%, the reduction was not larger against the initial immunization genotype. Our results suggest significant cross-reactivity, which may be advantageous for the host in genetically diverse re-exposures and have significant evolutionary implications for parasite strategies. Overall, our study is among the first to demonstrate cross-reactivity of adaptive immunity against genetically diverse macroparasites with complex life cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2013954880,"The aim of this study was to identify the molecular signals produced in human endothelial cells (ECs) by the interaction of α5β31 integrin with soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1) present in the extracellular matrix. We generated a gene expression profile of ECs adhering to sVEGFR-1 or to fibronectin, the classic extracellular matrix ligand for α5β1 integrin or in a nonadhering condition. Several biological pathways were differently modulated, 3 protein kinase C substrates [adducin, myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS), and radixin] were differently expressed and phosphorylated when cells adhering to sVEGFR-1 were compared with those adhering to fibronectin. Rac1 activation and Gα13 protein involvement through the interaction with radixin were also detected after attachment to sVEGFR-1, and these responses depended on active VEGFR-2 signaling. On sVEGFR-1, ECs exhibited a motile phenotype that was consistent with the abundant presence of MARCKS, a stabilizer of dynamic adhesions. Moreover, ECs silenced for radixin expression no longer responded to the proangiogenic VEGFR-1-derived peptide 12. We propose that the presence of sVEGFR-1 in the EC microenvironment directs α5β1 integrin signaling to generate a dynamic, motile phenotype. Our findings also provide new insights into the mechanism of action of proangiogenic peptide 12, relevant to a therapeutic perspective.—Orecchia, A., Mettouchi, A., Uva, P., Simon, G.C., Areclli, D., Avitabile, S., Ragone, G., Meneguzzi, G., Pfenninger, K.H., Zambruno, G., Failla, C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2030748067,"The Notch signaling pathway mediates the direct communication between adjacent cells and regulates multiple developmental processes. Interaction of the Notch receptor with its ligands induces the liberation of the intracellular portion of Notch (NICD) referred to as regulated intramembraneous proteolysis (RIP). NICD translocates to the nucleus, and by complexing with the DNA binding protein RBPjκ and other cofactors activates transcription of bHLH genes. RIP-like processing of various mammalian Notch ligands (DLL1, JAG1 and JAG2) and the translocation of their intracellular domains (ICDs) to the nucleus has also been observed. These observations together with effects of over-expressed ligand ICDs in cultured cells on cell proliferation, differentiation, and Notch activity and target gene expression have led to the idea that the intracellular domains of Notch ligands have signaling functions. To test this hypothesis in vivo we have generated ES cells and transgenic mice that constitutively express various versions of the intracellular domain of mouse DLL1. In contrast to other cell lines, expression of DICDs in ES cells did not block proliferation or stimulate neuronal differentiation. Embryos with ubiquitous DICD expression developed to term without any apparent phenotype and grew up to viable and fertile adults. Early Notch-dependent processes or expression of selected Notch target genes were unaltered in transgenic embryos. In addition, we show that mouse DICD enters the nucleus inefficiently. Collectively, our results argue against a signaling activity of the intracellular domain of DLL1 in mouse embryos in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2095048947,"Lipofuscin accumulation in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of the eye implicates the etiologies of Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Here, we have identified a previously unknown RPE lipofuscin component. By one- and two-dimensional NMR techniques and mass spectrometry, we confirmed that this compound is a new type of pyridinium bisretinoid presenting an unusual structure, in which two polyenic side chains are attached to adjacent carbons of a pyridinium ring. This pigment is a light-induced isomer of isoA2E, rather than A2E, referred to as iisoA2E. This pigment is a fluorescent lipofuscin compound with absorbance maxima at ∼430 and 352 nm detected in human, pig, mouse, and bovine eyes. Formation of iisoA2E was found in reaction mixtures of all-trans-retinal and ethanolamine. Excess intracellular accumulation of this adduct in RPE cells in vitro leads to a significant loss of cell viability and caused membrane damage. Phospholipase D-mediated phosphodiester cleavage of the A2PE series generated isoA2E and iisoA2E, in addition to A2E, thus corroborating the presence of isoA2PE and iisoA2PE that may serve as biosynthetic precursors of isoA2E and iisoA2E."
https://openalex.org/W2156247610,"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are master regulators of the transcriptional response to hypoxia. To gain insight into the structural and functional evolution of the HIF family, we characterized the HIFα gene from amphioxus, an invertebrate chordate, and identified several alternatively spliced HIFα isoforms. Whereas HIFα Ia, the full-length isoform, contained a complete oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain, the isoforms Ib, Ic, and Id had 1 or 2 deletions in the ODD domain. When tagged with GFP and tested in mammalian cells, the amphioxus HIFα Ia protein level increased in response to hypoxia or CoCl2 treatment, whereas HIFα Ib, Ic, and Id showed reduced or no hypoxia regulation. Deletion of the ODD sequence in HIFα Ia up-regulated the HIFα Ia levels under normoxia. Gene expression analysis revealed HIFα Ic to be the predominant isoform in embryos and larvae, whereas isoform Ia was the most abundant form in the adult stage. The expression levels of Ib and Id were very low. Hypoxia treatment of adults had no effect on the mRNA levels of these HIFα isoforms. Functional analyses in mammalian cells showed all 4 HIFα isoforms capable of entering the nucleus and activating hypoxia response element-dependent reporter gene expression. The functional nuclear location signal (NLS) mapped to 3 clusters of basic residues. (775)KKARL functioned as the primary NLS, but (737)KRK and (754)KK also contributed to the nuclear localization. All amphioxus HIFα isoforms had 2 functional transactivation domains (TADs). Its C-terminal transactivation (C-TAD) shared high sequence identity with the human HIF-1α and HIF-2α C-TAD. This domain contained a conserved asparagine, and its mutation resulted in an increase in transcriptional activity. These findings reveal many ancient features of the HIFα family and provide novel insights into the evolution of the HIFα family."
https://openalex.org/W2009136389,"The aim of the present study was to test the validity of the transthoracic electrical bioimpedance method PhysioFlow® to measure stroke volume in patients with chronic anemia. Stroke volume index (SVI), as well as cardiac index (CI) obtained by transthoracic electrical bioimpedance method and doppler echocardiography were compared in healthy subjects (n = 25) and patients with chronic anemia (i.e. mainly with sickle cell anemia; n = 32), at rest. While doppler echocardiography was able to detect difference in SVI between the two populations, the Physioflow® failed to detect any difference. Bland & Altman analyses have demonstrated no interchangeability between the two methods to assess CI and SVI in anemic patients and healthy subjects. While doppler echocardiography displayed a good concordance for SVI results with those obtained in the literature for anemic patients, the Physioflow® did not. Finally, in contrast to doppler echocardiography: 1) the CI obtained with the Physioflow® was not correlated with the hemoglobin level and 2) the stroke volume determined by the Physioflow® was highly influenced by body surface area. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the Physioflow® device is inaccurate for the measurement of SVI and CI in patients with chronic anemia and has a poor accuracy for the measurement of these parameters in African healthy subjects."

https://openalex.org/W2093420364,"In colon cancer, a highly aggressive disease, progression through the malignant sequence is accompanied by increasingly numerous chromosomal rearrangements. To colonize target organs, invasive cells cross several tissues of various elastic moduli. Whether soft tissue increases malignancy or in contrast limits invasive colon cell spreading remains an open question. Using polyelectrolyte multilayer films mimicking microenvironments of various elastic moduli, we revealed that human SW480 colon cancer cells displayed increasing frequency in chromosomal segregation abnormalities when cultured on substrates with decreasing stiffness. Our results show that, although decreasing stiffness correlates with increased cell lethality, a significant proportion of SW480 cancer cells did escape from the very soft substrates, even when bearing abnormal chromosome segregation, achieve mitosis and undergo a new cycle of replication in contrast to human colonic HCoEpiC cells which died on soft substrates. This observation opens the possibility that the ability of cancer cells to overcome defects in chromosome segregation on very soft substrates could contribute to increasing chromosomal rearrangements and tumor cell aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2088628801,"The birthrate following round spermatid injection (ROSI) remains low in current and evidence suggests that factors in the germinal vesicle (GV) cytoplasm and certain substances in the GV such as the nucleolus might be responsible for genomic reprogramming and embryonic development. However, little is known whether the reprogramming factors in GV oocyte cytoplasm and/or nucleolus in GV are beneficial to the reprogramming of round spermatids and development of ROSI embryos. Here, round spermatids were treated with GV cytolysates and injected this round spermatid alone or co-injected with GV oocyte nucleolus into mature metaphase II oocytes. Subsequent embryonic development was assessed morphologically and by Oct4 expression in blastocysts. There was no significant difference between experimental groups at the zygote to four-cell development stages. Blastocysts derived from oocytes which were injected with cytolysate treated-round spermatid alone or co-injected with nucleoli injection yielded 63.6% and 70.3% high quality embryos, respectively; comparable to blastocysts derived by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), but higher than these oocytes which were co-injected with lysis buffer-treated round spermatids and nucleoli or injected with the lysis buffer-treated round spermatids alone. Furthermore, the proportion of live offspring resulting from oocytes which were co-injected with cytolysate treated-round spermatids and nucleoli or injected with cytolysate treated-round spermatids alone was higher than those were injected with lysis buffer treated-round spermaids, but comparable with the ICSI group. Our results demonstrate that factors from the GV cytoplasm improve round spermatid reprogramming, and while injection of the extra nucleolus does not obviously improve reprogramming its potential contribution, although which cannot be definitively excluded. Thus, some reprogramming factors are evidently present in GV oocyte cytoplasm and could significantly facilitate ROSI technology, while the nucleolus in GV seems also having a potential to improve reprogramming of round spermatids."
