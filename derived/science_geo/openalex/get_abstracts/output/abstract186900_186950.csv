However, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of global climatic changes on vegetation productivity has not before been expressed in the context of variable limiting factors to plant growth. We present a global investigation of vegetation responses to climatic changes by analyzing 18 years (1982 to 1999) of both climatic data and satellite observations of vegetation activity. Our results indicate that global changes in climate have eased several critical climatic constraints to plant growth, such that net primary production increased 6% (3.4 petagrams of carbon over 18 years) globally. The largest increase was in tropical ecosystems. Amazon rain forests accounted for 42% of the global increase in net primary production, owing mainly to decreased cloud cover and the resulting increase in solar radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2043895957,"The function of the ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated– and Rad3-related)–ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) protein kinase complex is crucial for the cellular response to replication stress and DNA damage. Here, we show that replication protein A (RPA), a protein complex that associates with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), is required for the recruitment of ATR to sites of DNA damage and for ATR-mediated Chk1 activation in human cells. In vitro, RPA stimulates the binding of ATRIP to ssDNA. The binding of ATRIP to RPA-coated ssDNA enables the ATR-ATRIP complex to associate with DNA and stimulates phosphorylation of the Rad17 protein that is bound to DNA. Furthermore, Ddc2, the budding yeast homolog of ATRIP, is specifically recruited to double-strand DNA breaks in an RPA-dependent manner. A checkpoint-deficient mutant of RPA, rfa1-t11 , is defective for recruiting Ddc2 to ssDNA both in vivo and in vitro. Our data suggest that RPA-coated ssDNA is the critical structure at sites of DNA damage that recruits the ATR-ATRIP complex and facilitates its recognition of substrates for phosphorylation and the initiation of checkpoint signaling."

We have labeled myosin V with a single fluorophore at different positions in the light-chain domain and measured the step size with a standard deviation of <1.5 nanometers, with 0.5-second temporal resolution, and observation times of minutes. The step size alternates between 37 + 2x nm and 37 - 2x, where x is the distance along the direction of motion between the dye and the midpoint between the two heads. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand model of motility, not an inchworm model."

To test this hypothesis, we studied chloroplast DNA variation in 22 widespread European trees and shrubs sampled in the same forests. Most species had genetically divergent populations in Mediterranean regions, especially those with low seed dispersal abilities. However, the genetically most diverse populations were not located in the south but at intermediate latitudes, a likely consequence of the admixture of divergent lineages colonizing the continent from separate refugia."
https://openalex.org/W2125309974,"Although the role of Toll-like receptors in extracellular bacterial sensing has been investigated intensively, intracellular detection of bacteria through Nod molecules remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that human Nod1 specifically detects a unique diaminopimelate-containing N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid (GlcNAc-MurNAc) tripeptide motif found in Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan, resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB pathway. Moreover, we show that in epithelial cells (which represent the first line of defense against invasive pathogens), Nod1is indispensable for intracellular Gram-negative bacterial sensing."
https://openalex.org/W2083829960,"Members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family recognize conserved microbial structures, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide and viral double-stranded RNA, and activate signaling pathways that result in immune responses against microbial infections. All TLRs activate MyD88-dependent pathways to induce a core set of stereotyped responses, such as inflammation. However, individual TLRs can also induce immune responses that are tailored to a given microbial infection. Thus, these receptors are involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses. The mechanisms and components of these varied responses are only partly understood. Given the importance of TLRs in host defense, dissection of the pathways they activate has become an important emerging research focus. TLRs and their pathways are numerous; Science's Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment's TLR Connections Map provides an immediate, clear overview of the known components and relations of this complex system."

https://openalex.org/W1481314844,"Insulin resistance is a major hallmark in the development of type II diabetes, which is characterized by the failure of insulin to promote glucose uptake in muscle and to suppress glucose production in liver. The serine-threonine kinase Akt (PKB) is a principal target of insulin signaling that inhibits hepatic glucose output when glucose is available from food. Here we show that TRB3, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila tribbles , functions as a negative modulator of Akt. TRB3 expression is induced in liver under fasting conditions, and TRB3 disrupts insulin signaling by binding directly to Akt and blocking activation of the kinase. Amounts of TRB3 RNA and protein were increased in livers of db/db diabetic mice compared with those in wild-type mice. Hepatic overexpression of TRB3 in amounts comparable to those in db/db mice promoted hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Our results suggest that, by interfering with Akt activation, TRB3 contributes to insulin resistance in individuals with susceptibility to type II diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2062574221,"Femtosecond phase-coherent two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy has been experimentally demonstrated as the direct optical analog of 2D nuclear magnetic resonance. An acousto-optic pulse shaper created a collinear three-pulse sequence with well-controlled and variable interpulse delays and phases,which interacted with a model atomic system of rubidium vapor. The desired nonlinear polarization was selected by phase cycling (coadding experimental results obtained with different interpulse phases). This method may enhance our ability to probe the femtosecond structural dynamics of macromolecules."

Kilometer-scale exposures of bedrock are observed; elsewhere airfall dust completely mantles the surface over thousands of square kilometers. Mars has compositional variations at 100-meter scales, for example, an exposure of olivine-rich basalt in the walls of Ganges Chasma. Thermally distinct ejecta facies occur around some craters with variations associated with crater age. Polar observations have identified temporal patches of water frost in the north polar cap. No thermal signatures associated with endogenic heat sources have been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2042709868,"Cytokines are inflammatory mediators important in responding to pathogens and other foreign challenges. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 are two cytokines produced by T helper type 2 cells, mast cells, and basophils. In addition to their physiological roles, these cytokines are also implicated in pathological conditions such as asthma and allergy. IL-4 can stimulate two receptors, type I and type II, whereas IL-13 signaling is mediated only by the type II receptor (see the STKE Connections Maps). These cytokines activate the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling cascades, which may contribute to allergic responses. In addition, stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway through recruitment of members of the insulin receptor substrate family may contribute to survival and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2060077622,"The medial temporal lobe is crucial for the ability to learn and retain new declarative memories. This form of memory includes the ability to quickly establish novel associations between unrelated items. To better understand the patterns of neural activity during associative memory formation, we recorded the activity of hippocampal neurons of macaque monkeys as they learned new associations. Hippocampal neurons signaled learning by changing their stimulus-selective response properties. This change in the pattern of selective neural activity occurred before, at the same time as, or after learning, which suggests that these neurons are involved in the initial formation of new associative memories."
https://openalex.org/W1972816816,"Recent studies have indicated that endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is regulated by reversible phosphorylation in intact endothelial cells. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has previously been demonstrated to phosphorylate and activate eNOS at Ser-1177 in vitro, yet the function of AMPK in endothelium is poorly characterized. We therefore determined whether activation of AMPK with 5′-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) stimulated NO production in human aortic endothelial cells. AICAR caused the time- and dose-dependent stimulation of AMPK activity, with a concomitant increase in eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation and NO production. AMPK was associated with immunoprecipitates of eNOS, yet this was unaffected by increasing concentrations of AICAR. AICAR also caused the time- and dose-dependent stimulation of protein kinase B phosphorylation. To confirm that the effects of AICAR were indeed mediated by AMPK, we utilized adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant negative AMPK mutant. Expression of dominant negative AMPK attenuated AICAR-stimulated AMPK activity, eNOS Ser-1177 phosphorylation and NO production and was without effect on AICAR-stimulated protein kinase B Ser-473 phosphorylation or NO production stimulated by insulin or A23187. These data suggest that AICAR-stimulated NO production is mediated by AMPK as a consequence of increased Ser-1177 phosphorylation of eNOS. We propose that stimuli that result in the acute activation of AMPK activity in endothelial cells stimulate NO production, at least in part due to phosphorylation and activation of eNOS. Regulation of endothelial AMPK therefore provides an additional mechanism by which local vascular tone may be controlled.

AMPK is the downstream component of a protein kinase cascade activated by a rise in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and is thought to act as a cellular energy charge sensor (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 4Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). AMPK is therefore activated by treatments that deplete ATP, and once activated, switches off ATP-consuming anabolic pathways via both the direct phosphorylation of and regulation of expression of metabolic enzymes (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 4Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). AMPK can be artificially activated in intact cells by treatment with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) (5Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). In most cell types, this nucleoside is taken up and accumulates in the cytoplasm as the monophosphorylated nucleotide, ZMP (5′-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide), which activates AMPK without disturbing cellular adenine nucleotide ratios (5Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar) such that any effects observed are not merely due to depletion of ATP. Studies with AICAR and recent studies in cells expressing constitutively active and dominant negative mutant forms of AMPK have confirmed the role of AMPK in the regulation of metabolism (4Hardie D.G.

Additionally, it has recently been proposed that the effects of a number of physiological and pharmacological stimuli are mediated by AMPK, including the antidiabetic drugs metformin and rosiglitazone (8Zhou G.

Nitric oxide, synthesized by endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), is an important regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis. Endothelium-derived NO promotes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation, leukocyte adherence, and vascular smooth muscle proliferation (13Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). These effects exert a profound influence on blood flow, vascular remodeling, and angiogenesis. It has recently been demonstrated that eNOS is regulated by reversible phosphorylation. AMPK has been demonstrated to activate cardiac and endothelial cell eNOS by phosphorylation at Ser-1177 (human sequence) in vitro (14Chen Z.-P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D.

Additionally, there have, to date, been no studies of the effects of AMPK activation on NO synthesis in human cells. There is substantial interest in the AMPK cascade as a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as diabetes (4Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A.

It is, therefore, important that the effects of AMPK activation in tissues such as endothelium, which would be subjected to such agents in vivo, are fully investigated. Incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with AICAR has been demonstrated to stimulate AMPK (32Dagher Z. Ruderman N. Tornheim K. Ido Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) and have investigated the effects of activation of AMPK cascade on NO synthesis in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) using the AMPK activator, AICAR. We report that acute incubation of HAECs with AICAR stimulates AMPK activity, Ser-1177 phosphorylation, and NO production, effects inhibited by the expression of a dominant-negative AMPK mutant. We propose that stimuli that result in the acute activation of AMPK activity in endothelial cells stimulate NO production, at least in part due to phosphorylation and activation of eNOS. Therefore, regulation of endothelial AMPK may provide a mechanism that controls NO production and thereby local vascular tone. Materials—Cryopreserved HAECs and cell culture media were obtained from TCS Cellworks (Botolph Claydon, Bucks, UK). AICAR, metformin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine, AMP, ATP, and rabbit anti-eNOS antibody were supplied by Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. l-NAME, A23187, DAF-2DA, PD90859, and mouse anti-eNOS antibodies were from Calbiochem.

All other reagents were from sources described previously (36Salt I.P. Connell J.M.C. Gould G.W. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). HAEC Cell Culture—HAECs were grown in large vessel endothelial cell medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and passaged when at 80% confluence. Cells were used for experiments between passages 3 and 6. Evaluation of Nitric Oxide Release Using a Sievers NO Meter—Cells cultured in 24-well plates were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 0.5 ml/well Krebs Ringer HEPES (KRH) buffer (119 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 100 μm l-arginine, 5 mm glucose) at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced with 0.2 ml of fresh KRH buffer in the presence or absence of AICAR for 1 h. The medium was removed and refluxed in glacial acetic acid containing NaI. Under these conditions, NO2- , a stable breakdown product of NO, is quantitatively reduced to NO. NO-specific chemiluminescence was then analyzed using a Sievers 280A NO meter. Values were corrected for NO2- present in media in the absence of cells, and the appropriate control experiments were performed in the presence of the eNOS inhibitor, l-NAME. NO production (adjusted for l-NAME-insensitive production) is expressed per hour per well. Evaluation of Nitric Oxide Release by DAF-2 Fluorescence—To further determine NO production in HAECs, a membrane-permeable fluorescent indicator DAF-2DA was used that allows a quantitative determination of NO production (37Nakatsubo N. Kojima H. Kikuchi K. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Maeda D. Imai Y. Irimura T. Nagano T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips in 6-well plates were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 1 ml/well KRH buffer in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm l-NAME. DAF-2DA (5 μm final) was added, and the coverslips were incubated for a further 15 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of fresh KRH buffer in the presence or absence of l-NAME and test substances. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cells fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and mounted on slides. Specimens were observed under a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 40× objective, excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and a LP515-nm filter. Triplicate coverslips were prepared for each experimental condition, and 10 random images of HAECs were collected from each and quantified using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) software. Preparation of HAEC Lysates—Cells grown in 100-mm diameter cell culture dishes were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5 ml of KRH buffer. The medium was replaced with 5 ml of fresh KRH buffer containing test substances and incubated for various durations at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1% (w/v) Thesit, 250 mm mannitol) added. The cell extract was scraped off and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Extracts were vortex-mixed and centrifuged (14,000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C before use. Sequential PEG precipitation was used to prepare 2.5–6.25% PEG precipitates from some lysates, which were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C before AMPK assay (38Hardie D.G. Haystead T.A.J. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 201-219Google Scholar). Adenoviruses—Dominant negative AMPK adenovirus (Ad.α1-DN) was constructed from AMPKα1 containing a mutation altering Asp-157 to alanine (D157A) as described previously (6Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were propagated in HEK293 cells, purified by cesium chloride density centrifugation, and stored as described previously (6Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Infection of HAECs—HAECs were infected with 10 Pfu/cell adenovirus in complete medium. After 2 h, 1 further volume of complete medium was added, and the cells were cultured for 48 h before experimentation. Preliminary studies revealed that within 48 h of infection with a green fluorescent protein-expressing virus, the majority (>95%) of HAECs expressed green fluorescent protein. Immunoprecipitation of eNOS—HAEC lysate (200 μg) was added to 20 μl of 25% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose prebound to 5 μg of mouse anti-eNOS, and the volume was made up to 300 μl with lysis buffer and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating mixer. The mixture was then centrifuged (14,000 × g, 30 s, 4 °C), and the pellet was washed 3 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Assay of AMPK—AMPK was immunoprecipitated from lysates and assayed using the AMARA substrate peptide as described previously (36Salt I.P. Connell J.M.C. Gould G.W. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An AMARA peptide kinase could also be detected in PEG precipitates resuspended in HEPES-Brij buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% (v/v) Brij-35) as described previously (38Hardie D.G. Haystead T.A.J. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 201-219Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Statistics—Unless stated otherwise, results are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistically significant differences were determined using a 2-tailed independent-samples Student's t test, with p < 0.05 as significant using Statview software. The expression of two distinct isoforms of the catalytic α subunit of AMPK (termed α1 and α2) has been demonstrated in a number of tissues (3Cheung P.C.F. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Carling D.

To determine the effects of AICAR and metformin on AMPK activity in HAECs, total AMPK was assayed in HAEC lysates prepared from cells incubated for various duration in 0.5 mm AICAR or 2 mm metformin after immunoprecipitation with a mixture of anti-α1 and anti-α2 antibodies. Treatment of HAECs with AICAR elicited a transient activation of AMPK. The effect reached a maximum 2.3-fold stimulation at 30 min, which was sustained for a further 30 min (Fig. 1A). However, treatment of HAECs with metformin had no significant effect on AMPK activity over the time course used in this study (Fig. 1A). Activation of AMPK by AICAR was dose-dependent (Fig. 1B) such that AMPK was stimulated maximally (∼3-fold) by 2 mm AICAR, a concentration at which all further experiments were performed. To determine the relative activities of AMPK complexes containing either catalytic subunit isoform in HAECs, AMPK was immunoprecipitated using anti-α1 or -α2 antibodies and assayed for AMPK activity under basal and AICAR-stimulated conditions. The majority (∼90%) of the AMPK activity in both basal and AICAR-stimulated conditions was in complexes containing the α1 catalytic subunit isoform (Table I).Table IThe effect of 2 mm AICAR on catalytic α subunit isoform-specific AMPK activity in HAECsImmunoprecipitating antibodyBasal2 mm AICARAMPKα10.30 ± 0.060.78 ± 0.15AMPKα20.02 ± 0.010.06 ± 0.04AMPKα1 and AMPKα20.36 ± 0.080.87 ± 0.11 Open table in a new tab Next we examined the ability of AICAR to modulate NO production in HAECs. AICAR-stimulated NO production was measured using a Sievers 280A NO meter. AICAR stimulated l-NAME-sensitive NO production in a dose-dependent manner and was stimulated maximally by 2 mm AICAR (Fig. 2A). AICAR-stimulated NO production was only marginally less than that elicited by A23187, which directly increases intracellular Ca2+ concentrations or insulin, which has been demonstrated to stimulate NO production via PKB-mediated phosphorylation and activation of eNOS at Ser-1177 (17Montagnani M.

Physiol. 2001; 280: C1057-C1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To confirm the stimulation of NO production by AICAR, HAECs were loaded with DAF-2, a dye that upon binding to an oxidized species of NO results in fluorescence. Quantification of confocal images of DAF-2 fluorescence demonstrated the dose-dependent stimulation of NO production in cells stimulated with AICAR for 30 min (Fig. 2B). AICAR-stimulated DAF-2 fluorescence was completely inhibited in cells pretreated with the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (Fig. 2B). AMPK has been demonstrated to be associated with eNOS immunoprecipitated from rat heart homogenates and also to phosphorylate eNOS at Ser-1177 in vitro (14Chen Z.-P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, AMPKα1 was present in eNOS immunoprecipitates, yet increasing concentrations of AICAR had no effect on the level of AMPK associated with eNOS. We next used an anti-phospho-Ser-1177 antibody to determine the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 in HAEC lysates from cells stimulated with A"
https://openalex.org/W1990879144,"Phosphorylation of Notch proteins has been indirectly correlated with Notch activation and nuclear translocation as well as cellular transformation. There is evidence that the Wnt signaling pathway, which results in glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) inhibition, cross-talks with the Notch pathway. In this study, we show that GSK-3β is able to bind and phosphorylate Notch2 in vitro and in vivo. We identify three specific phosphorylation sites in the Notch2 serine/threoninerich domain that are dependent on GSK-3β activity. Phosphorylation of the serine/threonine-rich domain has been shown previously to be crucial in regulating cytokine-specific cell differentiation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that full-length Notch2 binds more efficiently than intracellular Notch2 to GSK-3β. Nevertheless, only the processed Notch2 is a substrate for the kinase, thus suggesting that GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation may be specifically regulating the activated Notch molecule. Consistent with this, GSK-3β inhibits the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes both in vitro and in vivo, whereas lithium chloride treatment or Wnt-1 overexpression that results in GSK-3β inhibition leads to the up-regulation of the Hes-1 promoter. Together, our results suggest that cross-talk between Notch and Wnt pathways may be partially mediated by specific regulation of GSK-3β-dependent Notch phosphorylation.

Notch receptors play critical roles in cell fate decisions during many developmental processes (reviewed in Refs. 1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar and 2Egan S.E. St. Pierre B. Leow C.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 273-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, but not exclusively, Notch activity leads to the inhibition of differentiating signals, thereby preserving progenitors that are capable of responding to subsequent signals and generating cell diversity (3Kopan R. Turner D.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Activation of Notch by its ligands triggers a proteolytic process, dependent on presenilin 1 (4Song W.

(reviewed in Ref. 5Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). Then, Notch-IC translocates to the nucleus to bind RBP-Jκ, which turns from transcriptional repressor to activator through p300/CBP histone acetyl transferases (HAT) recruitment (6Fryer C.J. Lamar E. Turbachova I. Kintner C. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1397-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Notch receptors are post-translationally modified by glycosylation (7Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation (8Kidd S. Lieber T. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), adding further complexity to the regulation of Notch signaling. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, was originally identified as an enzyme that regulates glycogen synthesis in response to insulin (9Embi N. Rylatt D.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). More recently, GSK-3β was rediscovered as a key developmental component in metazoan pattern formation and tumorigenesis (10He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 11Kim L. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). GSK-3β activity has a complex regulation that involves phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, scaffolding complexes, and differential recognition of target substrates (reviewed in Ref. 12Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). The majority of GSK-3β substrates are formed by a previous phosphorylation by another kinase creating a consensus sequence such as (S/T)XXX(S/T)-PO4 where S/T corresponds to serine or threonine. Some examples of priming kinases for GSK-3β are casein kinase I and II, protein kinase A, Cdc25, and some of the best characterized primed/phosphorylated substrates are β-catenin (13Hagen T. Di Daniel E. Culbert A.A. Reith A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23330-23335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), Tau (14Cho J.-H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) or Cubitus interruptus (15Price M.A. Kalderon D. Cell. 2002; 108: 823-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GSK-3β can also phosphorylate unprimed substrates including Axin or adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which are key components of the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway (reviewed in Ref. 16Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The Wnt family include several secreted glycoproteins that are required for a variety of developmental events. The canonical Wnt pathway involves the interaction of Wnt with the Frizzled receptor that results in inhibition of GSK-3β by an unclear mechanism involving the phosphoprotein Dishevelled. In this context, GSk-3β cannot phosphorylate β-catenin, therefore preventing its degradation, allowing nuclear accumulation, and leading to the activation of β-catenin/T cell factor target genes. Inhibitory cross-talk between Notch and Wnt signaling pathways has been reported to occur at the level of Notch extracellular domain binding to Wnt (17Wesley C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5743-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the level of Notch intracellular domain binding to Dishevelled (18Axelrod J.D. Matsuno K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Perrimon N. Science. 1996; 271: 1826-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is some evidence for synergistic cross-talk between both pathways, resulting in the activation of different sets of genes that require both Notch and Wingless proteins (17Wesley C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5743-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), (19Couso J.P. Knust E. Martinez Arias A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that only nuclear forms of Notch1-IC (20Redmond L. Oh S.R. Hicks C. Weinmaster G. Ghosh A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and Notch2-IC (N2-IC) (21Ingles-Esteve J. Espinosa L. Milner L.A. Caelles C. Bigas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44873-44880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) can be phosphorylated and that ligand binding induces both Notch2 hyperphosphorylation and nuclear translocation (22Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both phosphorylation and nuclear translocation appear to be necessary for oncogenic transformation mediated by Notch (23Ronchini C. Capobianco A.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3914-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By contrast, we have shown recently that specific phosphorylation of N2-IC in the Ser/Thr rich (STR) domain renders the molecule inactive and permits cytokine-induced cell differentiation in a myeloid cell line (21Ingles-Esteve J. Espinosa L. Milner L.A. Caelles C. Bigas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44873-44880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We now report that GSK-3β is able to induce specific phosphorylation in the previously identified STR domain of Notch2. We show that GSK-3β directly binds at C-terminal of the Notch2 ankyrin repeats and phosphorylates Thr-2068 and/or Ser-2070, Thr-2074, and Thr-2093. We also find that GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of Notch2 is inhibiting transcriptional activation of different Notch target genes. Phosphorylation of Notch2 by GSK-3β is reversed in the presence of Wnt-1, resulting in the up-regulation of Notch-dependent transcription of the Hes-1 promoter. Plasmids and Notch Constructs—Full-length Notch2 (Fl-N2) (amino acids 1–2472), N2-IC (amino acids 1699–2472), and N2-ICΔOP (amino acids 1699–2155) constructs cloned in the pCS2+MT have been described (21Ingles-Esteve J.

Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins were purified from the Escherichia coli BL-21 strain in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor complex (Roche Applied Science) and bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Sepharose beads with GST fusion proteins were first blocked with untransfected HEK-293T cell lysates by 1 h of incubation at 4 °C and then incubated with 400 μg of HEK-293T-transfected cell lysate in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor complex (Roche Applied Science). The reaction was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed six times with the same buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin for 30 min. Cell lysates were boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) membranes. Membranes were blocked and incubated with α-Myc (9E10) antibody, α-HA hybridoma, or α-FLAG (Sigma) followed by incubation with the anti-mouse conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (DAKO). For detection, enhanced chemiluminescent reaction (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) was performed according to the manufacturer's specification. Cell Culture and Transactivation Assay—NIH-3T3 and HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's media with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation and harvested 24–48 h later. For transactivation assays, Notch and GSK-3β constructs or the vector alone were cotransfected with the indicated reporter plasmid. β-galactosidase expression was used for normalization of activity. After 48 h, lysates were prepared using cell lysis buffer (Promega) following the manufacturer's specifications. Results are reported as the ratio between individually normalized luciferase activities and the control empty vector. In some experiments, lithium chloride (LiCl) was added at the indicated concentrations for 12 h. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—GSK-3β was immunoprecipitated from HEK-293T transfected cells with α-HA antibody conjugated to Sepharose-protein A. Purified GST proteins were then incubated with the anti-HA immunoprecipitates in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm cold ATP, and 5 μCi of γ-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 20 min at 32 °C. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected in a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). GSK-3β immunoprecipitation was confirmed by Western blot. In Vivo Phosphorylation—HEK-293T transfected cells were incubated in 0.5 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 1 h at 37° and 5% CO2. Then, 0.3 mCi [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) was added for the next 3 h. Some cultures were incubated with 20 mm LiCl 12 h before and during labeling. Cells were washed extensively and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin. Notch molecules were immunoprecipitated with α-N2 or α-Myc antibodies and electrophoresed through an SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and autoradiographed. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Coomassie staining and/or immunostained with α-Myc antibody. Densitometric values were obtained with the Quantity One software by measuring the intensity of the labeled protein compared with the total immunoprecipitated protein. Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—48 h after transfection, HEK-293T cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.25 mm PMSF, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 7.5 μg of anti-HA antibody (Berkeley Antibody) or α-N2 antibody (21Ingles-Esteve J. Espinosa L. Milner L.A. Caelles C. Bigas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44873-44880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunocomplexes were washed extensively with immunoprecipitation buffer, and the precipitates were boiled in Laemmli buffer and assayed by Western blot. As negative controls, lysates were boiled for 3 min in the presence of 1% SDS followed by renaturalization with 1% Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with the same antibody. Immunofluorescence—293T cells were seeded on slides at 20% confluence and transfected with the indicated plasmids. After 24 h, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 25 min at 4 °C, washed in PBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and 5% nonfat dry milk for 25 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibody for 90 min at 4 °C and washed extensively in PBS and 1% nonfat dry milk. After 90 min of incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody, slides were washed extensively and mounted with Vectashield plus 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Cells were visualized in an Olympus BX-60 microscope with the appropriate filters. Representative images were taken with a Spot 4.3 digital camera and software and edited in Adobe Photoshop. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Chomczynski and Sacchi method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNAs were size-fractionated by electrophoresis, transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and then hybridized with radiolabeled Hes1, Hes5, or Herp2 probes. Phosphorylation of the Notch2 Molecule by GSK-3β—Our previous work showed that specific Notch2 phosphorylation can modify Notch function in myeloid differentiation (21Ingles-Esteve J. Espinosa L. Milner L.A. Caelles C. Bigas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44873-44880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In those studies we showed that cytokine-dependent phosphorylation of Notch2 in the STR region resulted in the inactivation of the Notch2 molecule, thus permitting cell differentiation in the 32D myeloid cell system. In other systems, Notch phosphorylation has been correlated with Notch activation (22Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or enhanced RBP-Jκ binding (31Foltz D.R. Nye J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although nothing is known about the kinases involved. To answer this question, we analyzed the sequence of the Notch2 protein and tested the ability of different candidate kinases to phosphorylate Notch2 in vivo (data not shown). In this work we present evidence that GSK-3β specifically phosphorylates the Notch2 molecule. We show in Fig 1A that the GST-N2-ICΔOP fusion protein was phosphorylated in vitro by GSK-3β. In these experiments, we immunoprecipitated HA-GSK-3β from transfected or untransfected control HEK-293T cells and incubated these precipitates with purified GST and GST-N2-ICΔOP fusion proteins. We observed an apparent radiolabeled band corresponding to GST-N2-ICΔOP incubated with HA-GSK-3β precipitates (Fig. 1A, third lane from the left) that was absent from the control precipitates (Fig. 1A, second lane from the left). When we performed the same reaction in the presence of the GSK-3β inhibitor LiCl (Fig. 1A, far right lane) or by incubating GST-N2-ICΔOP with the control precipitates (Fig. 1A, second lane from the left), phosphorylation was not detected, thus confirming kinase specificity. Next, we tested whether GSK-3β was able to phosphorylate Notch2 in vivo (Fig. 1B). We transfected HEK-293T cells with either N2-ICΔOP or GSK-3β or both together and incubated the cells in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. After N2-ICΔOP precipitation, we detected increased phosphorylation of this protein when cotransfected with GSK-3β. As expected, phosphorylation decreased to basal levels when performed in the presence of LiCl. Densitometric analysis of the phosphorylated compared with total N2-IC protein showed that phosphorylation of N2-ICΔOP was 1.8-fold higher in the presence of GSK-3β. These results demonstrate that Notch2 is phosphorylated by GSK-3β both in vitro and in vivo. Notch2 Physically Interacts with GSK-3β in Vivo—To provide more evidence that Notch2 is a direct substrate of GSK-3β, we investigated whether both proteins were able to physically interact. First, we performed pull-down assays incubating lysates from GSK-3β-overexpressing HEK-293T cells with bacterially expressed GST-N2-ICΔOP. As shown in Fig. 2A, GSK-3β bound to GST-N2-ICΔOP, although no interaction was detected in the GST control. Then we assayed the association of these proteins in a cellular context by coimmunoprecipitation assays to provide more physiological evidence of this interaction. We transfected HEK-293T cells with MT-N2-IC with or without HA-GSK-3β and immunoprecipitated GSK-3β with an α-HA antibody. Consistent with the results from pull-down experiments, N2-IC was specifically detected in the GSK-3β immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B). Together, these results indicate that Notch2 interacts with GSK3-β in vivo and that the interacting domain is within the N2-ICΔOP fragment. The GSK-3β Binding Domain of Notch2 Is within Ankyrin Repeat Number Six—Because we showed that the N2-ICΔOP molecule binds to GSK-3β (Fig. 2A), we next characterized the region of Notch2 responsible for this binding. We generated different GST-N2-ICΔOP deletion mutants, which are graphically represented above Fig. 2C, and performed pull-down assays with extracts from HA-GSK-3β-transfected HEK-293T cells. We observed that Notch2 molecules containing the N-terminal ankyrin repeats (ANK, amino acids1824–2064) could only weakly bind GSK-3β, similar to the peptide containing ANK1–3 (amino acids 1824–1885). However, peptides exclusively containing the C-terminal ankyrin repeat number six (ANK6, amino acids 2020–2064) showed considerably more GSK-3β binding activity relative to other mutants (Fig. 2C). This suggests that, although GSK-3β can interact with different ankyrin repeats on the Notch2 protein, the higher affinity interaction domain involves ankyrin number 6. GSK-3β Phosphorylates Three Specific Residues in the STR Domain of Notch2—To determine which Notch2 residues are targets for GSK-3β phosphorylation, we first tested whether the Notch2 fragments used for binding experiments were phosphorylated in vitro. As a positive control we used N2-ICΔOP construct, and, surprisingly, we observed that neither the fragment containing ankyrin 6, which showed high binding affinity for GSK-3β, nor different constructs, including the Notch ankyrin repeats, were phosphorylated by the kinase (Fig. 3A, second, third, and fourth lanes from the left). Nevertheless, a peptide extending to the region located immediately at the C-terminal of the GSK-3β binding domain (Fig. 3A, far right lane) was highly phosphorylated. Because this includes the previously described STR region, we hypothesized that STR may be the target for GSK-3β phosphorylation. In agreement with this, we observed that GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the previously reported N2-ICΔOP mutants (21Ingles-Esteve J. Espinosa L. Milner L.A. Caelles C. Bigas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44873-44880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Bigas A. Martin D.I. Milner L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2324-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) lacking the STR region compared with the N2-ICΔOP (data not shown). We then generated serial deletions from the STR region and performed in vitro GSK-3β phosphorylation assays. Results in Fig. 3B showed that phosphorylation of the fragment containing amino acids 2020–2088 was greatly reduced compared with fragment 2020–2105, indicating that GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation sites are preferentially restricted to the region comprised between amino acids 2088 and 2105. Additional deletion of amino acids 2065–2088 resulted in the total abrogation of GSK-3β phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, fourth and fifth lanes from the left) thus suggesting that additional GSK-3β phosphorylation sites are present within the amino acid fragment 2065–2088. To identify the specific phosphorylated residues, we generated several point mutations and deletion mutants in peptides 2020–2105 and 2020–2088. Fig. 3C shows that mutation of S2093A in peptide 2020–2105 resulted in a notable decrease in phosphorylation compared with that obtained with peptide 2020–2088, which lacks Ser-2093. This result suggests that Ser-2093 of Notch2 is one of the main targets for GSK-3β phosphorylation. Next, we characterized the residues responsible for phosphorylation of peptide 2020–2088. Deletion of amino acids 2077–2081 containing three Ser/Thr residues (TSALS) in the 2020–2088 fragment did not show any change in the phosphorylation. However, a double mutant (T2068A/S2070A) in the 2020–2088 fragment or an additional point mutation (S2074A) in the ΔTSALS fragment showed reduced phosphorylation compared with the wild type fragments (Fig. 3D). Altogether, these results demonstrate that residue Ser-2093 is efficiently phosphorylated by GSK-3β and, to a minor extent, residues Thr-2068 and/or Ser-2070 and Thr-2074 of Notch2 are also targets for GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation. Subcellular Localization of GSK-3β Is Modulated by Activated Notch2—GSK-3β is localized in either the nucleus or the cytosol. This different localization is dependent on cell type and, in some cases, correlates with levels of the Frat/GBP protein, which is involved in its nuclear export (32Franca-Koh J. Yeo M. Fraser E. Young N. Dale T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43844-43848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, GSK-3β expressed in HEK-293T cells is primarily cytoplasmic (Fig. 4A, section 1), whereas activated Notch (N2-IC) is exclusively nuclear (Fig. 4A, section 8). Because our results demonstrated that GSK-3β phosphorylates activated Notch in vivo in this cell line, we investigated the possibility that subcellular localization of N2-IC or GSK-3β may change when both molecules are coexpressed. We transfected HEK-293T cells with GSK-3β alone or in the presence of N2-IC and determined their subcellular localization by immunofluorescence. In most of the cells coexpressing both proteins (75%), GSK-3β localized in the nucleus (Fig. 4A, sections 7–9). Because inactive full-length Notch2 is mainly localized in the membrane and cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 4A, section 5) we hypothesized that the coexpression of Fl-N2 would not have such a great effect on the cytoplasmic localization of GSK-3β. To test this, we coexpressed GSK-3β with Fl-N2 and observed that both molecules colocalized in the cytoplasm in 50% of cells (Fig. 4A, sections 4–6). Of note, the coexpression of Fl-N2 leads to a moderate nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β in ∼45% of the cells (Fig. 4A, section 4), which correlates with increased nuclear Notch staining. This may correspond to intracellular Notch generated by cellular processing of the overexpressed full-length Notch-2 molecule. Taking all this together, we find that, expressing either N2-IC or Fl-N2, GSK-3β colocalized with α-N2 staining in the majority of the cells. Moreover, because GSK-3β was mainly cytoplasmic in the absence of N2-IC, these results suggest that GSK-3β may translocate to the nucleus bound to the activated Notch2. GSK-3β Interacts with but Does Not Phosphorylate Full-length Notch2—Because immunofluorescence staining patterns suggested that GSK-3β colocalized with both full-length and N2-IC proteins, we further studied the interaction between GSK-3β and both N2-IC and full-length molecules. Coimmunoprecipitation assays with α-N2 antibody from HEK-293T-transfected cell lysates showed that GSK-3β bound more efficiently to full-length Notch2 compared with the N2-IC molecule (Fig. 5A). Because we also detected GSK-3β in precipitates from cells transfected with GSK-3β plasmid alone"

One attributes such changes to reorganizations of the ocean's thermohaline circulation and the other to changes in tropical atmosphere-ocean dynamics. In an attempt to distinguish between these hypotheses, two lines of evidence are examined. The first involves the timing of the freshwater injections to the northern Atlantic that have been suggested as triggers for the global impacts associated with the Younger Dryas and Heinrich events. The second has to do with evidence for precursory events associated with the Heinrich ice-rafted debris layers in the northern Atlantic and with the abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger warmings recorded in the Santa Barbara Basin."

Alcohol-induced liver injury is the most common liver disease in which fatty acid metabolism is deranged.

Although fatty liver was thought in the past to be relatively benign, more recent studies show that fat accumulation renders the liver more susceptible to injury by other agents such as drugs and toxins, especially endotoxins (3Bhagwandeen B.S.

Therefore, fatty liver must be treated as an important liver disorder, possibly amenable to better therapy.

Fatty acid levels are increased in the liver during the metabolism of ethanol; therefore, the PPARα battery of proteins should be induced by alcohol consumption. Although a subset of the PPARα responsive genes were reported to be induced by ethanol, such as cytochrome P450 4A1 (lauryl ω-hydroxylase) (15Ma X. Baraona E. Lieber C.S.

Res. 2000; 19: 117-130Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were decreased by ethanol feeding. These reports suggest that the PPARα battery of fat-metabolizing enzymes is not fully induced during ethanol feeding and suggest the possibility that activation of this system would ameliorate some of the toxic effects of ethanol. Indeed, a recent study (23Tsutsumi A. Takase S. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2001; 25: 75S-79SCrossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that fenofibrate, a PPARα ligand, ameliorated the fatty liver and hepatomegaly of ethanol feeding in three of five rats and decreased serum triacylglycerol level in alcoholic patients despite the fact that they continued drinking during the fenofibrate administration. Similarly, an early study indicated that feeding rats clofibrate ameliorated the fatty liver and hepatomegaly resulting from ethanol feeding (24Spritz N. Lieber C.S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1966; 121: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recent data from our laboratory (25Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar) showed that ethanol and its metabolite, acetaldehyde, inhibited the transcriptional and DNA binding activity of the PPARα receptor, inhibited PPARα activation of a reporter plasmid in hepatoma cells, and reduced the ability of Wy14,643, a potent PPARα agonist, to activate the reporter in hepatoma cells or cultured rat hepatocytes. This effect of ethanol was abolished by the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole and augmented by the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor cyanamide, indicating that acetaldehyde was likely responsible for the action of ethanol. Furthermore, in vitro translated PPARα exposed to acetaldehyde failed to bind DNA (26Galli A. Pinaire J. Fischer M. Dorris R. Crabb D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 68-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because some PPARα-regulated genes mentioned above are induced with ethanol treatment, it is uncertain to what extent the effect of ethanol on the expression of a simple reporter construct in a hepatoma cell can be extrapolated to the expression of hepatic genes under the control of complex promoters or what the potential contribution of PPARα dysfunction to the multiple effects of ethanol on the liver might be. Therefore, in the present paper we study the effect of chronic ethanol feeding on PPARα and RXRα levels, PPAR/RXR binding activity, levels of PPAR-regulated genes, measures of fat metabolism in mice fed alcohol chronically, and the ability of the PPARα agonist WY14,643 to reverse the effects of ethanol. Animals and Diets—6–8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were housed individually in stainless steel wire-bottom cages in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room (23 °C and 50% relative humidity) with a 12:12-h yellow light/dark cycle. Liquid diets were based upon the Lieber-DeCarli formulation (27Lieber C.S. DeCarli L.M. Sorrell M.F. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and provide 1 kcal/ml (prepared by DYETS, Bethlehem, PA). Protein content was constant at 18% of total calories, fat 10% (6% from cocoa butter and 4% from safflower oil), and each diet had identical mineral and vitamin content. The animals were divided into four dietary groups: (a) ethanol-containing diet (27.5% of total calories), (b) pair-fed control diet in which ethanol was replaced isocalorically with carbohydrate, (c) control diet supplemented with 0.1% Wy-14,643, and (d) ethanol-containing diet supplemented with 0.1% Wy-14,643. In the latter two groups Wy-14,643 (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was added to the diet for the last 2 weeks of the study. For animals on an ethanol-containing diet, cages were placed on heating pads to maintain body temperature, because ethanol consumption can induce hypothermia. After 4 weeks of liquid diet feeding, the animals were sacrificed at 11 a.m., at which time blood and liver tissue were collected. The studies were approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee and the Veterans Affairs Animal Use Subcommittee. Assays from Blood—After animals were anesthetized, blood was collected by heart puncture. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 4 °C and stored at –20 °C. Plasma triacylglycerol and glucose were determined using kits from Roche Diagnostics. β-Hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) was measured using a KetoSite kit (GDS Diagnostics, Elkhart, IN). FFA was determined with a NEFA C-Test (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), and cholesterol was determined with Infinity cholesterol reagent (Sigma). Tissue Lipid Determination—Frozen sections of the liver (10 μm) were stained with Oil Red O and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin for histology. Samples of liver were homogenized in 0.25% sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA. Lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and evaporated in a Speedvac, and the pellets were dissolved in 5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin dissolved in water. Protein in the homogenate was assayed using protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) to normalize the amount of lipid extracted. Colorimetric cholesterol and triacylglycerol assays were carried out as described above. Fatty Acid β-Oxidation Activity—Fatty acid β-oxidation activity was measured according to Aoyama et al. (9Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzales F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh livers were homogenized and incubated with the assay medium containing 50 μm [1-14C]palmitic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 m perchloric acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and the unmetabolized fatty acids were removed by three extractions using 2 ml of n-hexane. Radioactive degradation products in the water phase were counted. Fatty acid β-oxidation activity was expressed as pmol [14C]palmitate oxidized/mg protein/min. Preparation and Analysis of Nuclear Extracts—Fresh livers were homogenized in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.15 mm spermine, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 m sucrose, 2% protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and nuclear proteins were extracted as described by Neish et al. (28Neish A. Khachigian L.M. Park A. Baichwal V.R. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28903-28909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) except that 1 mm NaF and 2% protease inhibitor were added to all buffers. Western blotting was performed by fractionating 60 μg of nuclear extract protein on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following polyclonal rabbit antibodies: anti-PPARα and anti-PPARγ (Geneka Biotechnology, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and anti-RXRα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immune complexes were detected using the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were quantified by Fluorimager (Amersham Biosciences). DNA binding assays were performed using the Gelshift kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Geneka Biotechnology, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The following probes were used: PPAR response element (PPRE), 5′-GAACTAGGTCAAAGGTCATCCCCT-3′; and mutant PPRE, 5′-GGAACTAGAACAAAGAACATCCCCT-3′. For supershift assays, anti-PPARα antibody was added (Geneka Biotechnology). Reaction mixtures containing 5-μg nuclear extracts were separated by electrophoresis (constant 210 V) on a 5% nondenaturing PAGE in 1× Tris/glycine electrophoresis buffer at 4 °C. The shifted bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) software analysis. RNA Isolation and Relative Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from frozen liver using an RNeasy™ Total RNA kit (Qiagen). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using reverse transcription and co-amplification of 18 S ribosomal RNA as internal control (QuantumRNA 18 S internal standard kit; Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μg of RNA was mixed with 2 μl of random primers (50 μm; Ambion) and RNase-free water up to 13.5 μl of volume, denatured at 80 °C for 3 min, and rapidly cooled on ice for 5 min. 1 μl of dNTP mix (10 mm), 0.5 μl of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), 4 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase 5× buffer (Promega), and 1 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus RT enzyme (Promega) were added to each sample. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 42 °C. PCR was performed in duplicate using 2 μl of the RT product in a reaction mixture containing 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (Promega), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of dNTPs (10 mm), 2 μl of gene-specific primer pair (5 μm each), 4 μl of 18 S Classic Primer and Competimer pair (Ambion), 0.25 μl of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.5 μl of [α-32P]dATP (10 μCi/μl), and nuclease-free water up to 50 μl. The optimal ratio of 18 S Classic Primer:Competimer was determined for each target gene individually. PCR was performed using the following general cycle profile: 94 °C for 5 min (94 °C for 30 s, 56–60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s) × cycle number, followed by a 72 °C for 7-min extension. PCR primer pairs were designed from mouse- and rat-specific sequence data (GenBank™) except for LCAD (29Hildebrandt A.L. Neufer P.D. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 278: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR cycle numbers were determined for each primer pair by extensive pretesting to optimize the conditions and that the product is with in the linear range of the PCR amplification (see Table I). Annealing temperature was 60 °C except for the LCAD primer pair (56 °C). Optimum MgCl2 concentration was 2 mm. 40 μl of the PCR products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and quantified with a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Data were expressed as ratio of the signals of the mRNA of interest to that of the internal control.Table IPrimers and reaction conditions used for RT-PCRGeneForward primer 5′-3′Reverse primer 5′-3′Predicted product sizeCycle No.GenBank™ accession No.bpAOXcttgttcgcgcaagtgaggcaggatccgactgtttacc21626AF006688MCADtggagacattgccaatcagcaccatagagctgaagacagg35526NM007382LCADaaggatttattaagggcaagaagcggaagcggaggcggagtc38028J05029VLCADcgtcagaggtgtactttgatggcatggactcagtcacatactgc26830AF017176LCPTcgcacggaaggaaaatggtgtgcccaatattcctgg21226AF017175VLACStgagctgatcaagtatgacgagtatctccaaccctgtcg27022AJ223958L-FABPgtggtccgcaatgagttcacgtattggtgattgtgtctcc15728Y14660PPARαaggcagatgacctggaaagtcatgcgtgaactccgtagtgg31226NM011144RXRαacttctctacccaggtgaactgatatcctcagtgctgctc30730NM011305ACCcactgtgaacatgtggaggaggctgatggtgatgacc15526AF374170 Open table in a new tab Data Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. for the experiments, which included between four and eight animals in each group. The paired t test was used to evaluate statistical differences between ethanol- and pair-fed mice. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Characterization of the Liver Response to the Diets and Drug Treatment—To determine the effect of ethanol on PPARα in vivo, we fed mice ethanol (27.5% of the total calories) using the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet and a pair-feeding protocol (27Lieber C.S. DeCarli L.M. Sorrell M.F. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) for 4 weeks. Ethanol was introduced gradually into the diet; after the animals were accommodated to the liquid diet, they were given alcohol 9% of the total calories for 2 days, then 18% for 3 days, and finally 27.5%. Two groups of mice were given 0.1% Wy14,643 for the last 2 weeks of the study with or without ethanol in their diet. Ethanol consumption had no apparent effect on the health status of the mice. An average 1–2-g increase in the body weight was observed in all four groups at the end of the feeding period. Ethanol feeding did not cause a significant increase in the liver/body weight ratio. Wy14,643 treatment enlarged the livers of both ethanol- and pair-fed mice, increasing the liver/body weight ratio from 0.04 ± 0.004 to 0.08 ± 0.007, a known effect of the hepatocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia caused by PPARα in rodents (30Marsman D.S. Cattley R.C. Conway J.G. Popp J.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6739-6744PubMed Google Scholar). Histological analysis of the livers with Oil Red O staining revealed prominent lipid accumulation in the livers of ethanol-fed animals (Fig. 1B) whereas lipid droplets were rare in the livers of the control group (Fig. 1A). Liver sections of pair-fed mice given Wy14,643 treatment looked similar to those of controls (Fig. 1C). When the ethanol-fed animals were co-treated with Wy14,643 for the last 2 weeks of the experiment, the Oil Red O staining showed no sign of hepatic steatosis (Fig. 1D). Quantification of liver lipids was concordant with the histologic findings (Fig. 2A). Ethanol feeding increased the liver triacylglycerol content by 4-fold. Wy14,643 treatment alone did not alter the amount of triacylglycerol in the liver. In striking contrast, when Wy14,643 was co-administered for the last 2 weeks of the ethanol feeding, the triacylglycerol content was significantly decreased to the level of control animals. Cholesterol content was induced by 2-fold in the livers of ethanol-fed animals (Fig. 2B), possibly a result of activation of SREBP-1 (31You M. Fischer M. Deeg M.A. Crabb D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (22947): 29342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Wy14,643 itself increased liver cholesterol content by about 2-fold. Gemfibrozil, another PPARα agonist, was reported recently (32Roglans N. Peris C. Verd J.C. Alegret M. Vazquez M. Sanchez R.M. Laguna J.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to increase the transcriptional activity of SREBP-2, a major regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis, and strongly induced 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase mRNA and activity. This effect of the PPARα activator may have resulted in enhanced cholesterol production in the liver. Animals fed ethanol plus Wy14,643 had lower cholesterol in liver than those W14,643. Effects of Chronic Ethanol Administration and Wy14,643 on Plasma Lipids and Hepatic Fatty Acid β-Oxidation—We measured plasma lipids to better understand the mechanisms by which ethanol and WY14,643 might influence hepatic steatosis. Because the liquid diets were withdrawn ∼5 h before the blood samples were taken, the plasma FFA most likely reflects the balance between peripheral lipolysis and hepatic fat oxidation, as the liver is the major utilizer of circulating FFAs in the early postabsorptive phase. Chronic ethanol feeding significantly increased the serum levels of FFA, triacylglycerol, and β-OHB as shown in Table II. Wy14,643 entirely prevented the elevation of FFA and triacylglycerol caused by ethanol, and its administration was accompanied by an even higher level of β-OHB than ethanol alone. Chronic ethanol feeding had no effect on serum cholesterol level, whereas Wy14,643 treatment alone and in combination with ethanol feeding increased the level of cholesterol.Table IIPlasma metabolite levels in mice fed ethanol and Wy14,643ParametersControlEthanolControl + Wy14,643Ethanol + Wy14,643FFA (μmol/L)979 ± 2671548 ± 304aSignificant difference versus control.,bp < 0.05.767 ± 322cSignificant difference versus alcohol-fed group.,dp < 0.001.851 ± 178cSignificant difference versus alcohol-fed group.,dp < 0.001.TG (mg/dL)115 ± 17204 ± 39aSignificant difference versus control.,bp < 0.05.108 ± 19bp < 0.05.,cSignificant difference versus alcohol-fed group.82 ± 20aSignificant difference versus control.,bp < 0.05.,cSignificant difference versus alcohol-fed group.Cholesterol (mg/dL)124 ± 11128 ± 10206 ± 30aSignificant difference versus control.,bp < 0.05.,cSignificant difference versus alcohol-fed group.,dp < 0.001.147 ± 12aSignificant difference versus control.,bp < 0.05.,cSignificant difference versus alcohol-fed group.,dp < 0.001.,eSignificant difference versus Wy-14,643 group.β-OHB (mg/dL)0.7 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.6aSignificant difference versus control.,dp < 0.001.3.2 ± 0.8aSignificant difference versus control.,bp < 0.05.,cSignificant difference versus alcohol-fed group.,dp < 0.001.3.2 ± 0.5aSignificant difference versus control.,cSignificant difference versus alcohol-fed group.,dp < 0.001.Glucose (mg/dL)247 ± 41205 ± 24211 ± 27193 ± 34aSignificant difference versus control.,bp < 0.05.a Significant difference versus control.b p < 0.05.c Significant difference versus alcohol-fed group.d p < 0.001.e Significant difference versus Wy-14,643 group. Open table in a new tab Total hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation capacity was assessed by using 14C-labeled palmitic acid (Fig. 3). This substrate was chosen, because studies on PPARα null mice showed defective mitochondrial catabolism of long chain fatty acids (9Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzales F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The rate of fatty acid oxidation was similar in control and ethanol-fed mice. Wy14,643 caused significant induction in palmitic acid oxidation compared with the control and ethanol-fed groups. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that despite the elevation of plasma and presumably hepatic FFA in the ethanol-fed animals, there was no induction of fatty acid oxidizing capacity. As a result, some FFA are converted to ketone bodies, but the remainder are esterified to triacylglycerol and either stored as fat droplets or secreted as triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. WY14,643 was able to induce fatty acid oxidizing capacity in the ethanol-fed animals sufficiently to dispose of them as ketone bodies or complete oxidation and therefore normalize plasma FFA and triacylglycerol levels and prevent fatty liver. This suggested that ethanol feeding subverted the normal homeostatic role of PPARα. Therefore the expression and functional capacity of PPARα were studied. Effect of Ethanol Feeding on Expression of PPARα and Its Heterodimerization Partner, RXRα, in Liver and DNA Binding Ability of PPARα/RXRα Heterodimers—The level of PPARα mRNA (Table III) and protein were not altered by ethanol (Fig. 4A). Wy14,643 increased PPARα mRNA expression by 5-fold (Table III) and significantly increased the amount of PPARα protein (Fig. 4, A and B). However, RXRα mRNA content decreased by 20% (Table III), and the level of immunoreactive RXRα protein was reduced by 60% in alcohol-fed mice, which could not be prevented by Wy14,643 (Fig. 4, A and B). Protein content of PPARγ, a receptor structurally related to PPARα that also recognizes DR-1 promoter elements, was unc"

In mammals, DNA methylation is the only known physiological modification of DNA. It primarily occurs at CG sites, which are methylated to 70–80% and encode epigenetic information on the DNA. DNA methylation is implicated in the regulation of gene expression, control of development, X chromosome inactivation, parental imprinting, and the protection of the genome against parasitic genetic elements such as transposons, retrotransposons, and viruses (for review see Refs. 1Jeltsch A.

However, it is also clear that in vivo the functions of maintenance and de novo methylation overlap, because accurate maintenance of the methylation at certain sequences also requires the presence of Dnmt3a and 3b and de novo methylation also relies on support by Dnmt1 (13Liang G.

Sprengel J. Kass S.U. Luyten W.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Lacking a large N-terminal part, the human protein comprises 391 amino acid residues, which show clear homology to prokaryotic DNA-(Cytosine-C5) MTases. Members of the Dnmt2 family are found in many species including man and mice, which also contain other DNA MTases, but also in D. melanogaster and S. pombe where these enzymes are the only obvious DNA MTase candidate genes. The strict conservation of all of the motifs characteristic for prokaryotic Cytosine-C5 MTases in Dnmt2 including the catalytically important amino acid residues suggests a function as DNA MTase. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that D. melanogaster DNA contains methylated cytosines that most probably is attributed to the activity of Dnmt2 (19Gowher H. Leismann O. Jeltsch A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6918-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Lyko F. Ramsahoye B.H. Jaenisch R. Nature. 2000; 408: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The structure of Dnmt2 was solved in complex with AdoMet, the cofactor for DNA methylation (21Dong A. Yoder J.A. Zhang X. Zhou L. Bestor T.H. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It shows strong similarities to other DNA MTases, supporting the assumption that the protein is a DNA MTase. Interaction with DNA could be detected in gel shift experiments. In addition, it has been reported that Dnmt2 covalently binds to DNA (21Dong A. Yoder J.A. Zhang X. Zhou L. Bestor T.H. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This observation also connects the protein to DNA MTases, which form a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate during catalysis (for review see Refs. 1Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bestor T.H. Verdine G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite considerable efforts no catalytic activity of Dnmt2 could be detected so far (10Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 17Yoder J.A. Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, Dnmt2-deficient embryonic stem cells are viable and do not show any obvious difference in the DNA methylation pattern (10Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar) and Dnmt2 knock-out animals are viable and fertile with minor defects. 2E. Li, personal communication. Cloning, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Protein Purification— Dnmt2 cDNA was obtained from the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH (Berlin, Germany) (clone number IMAGp998C184250Q2) amplified by PCR and cloned into pET28a+ (Novagen). A Dnmt2 variant in which the highly conserved active site residues Cys-79 and Glu-119 were exchanged by Ala was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis following standard procedures (24Jeltsch A. Lanio T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of all of the expression constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Dnmt2 and the Dnmt2 mutant were expressed in BL21 Rosetta(DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) and purified to homogeneity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography following a procedure described for Dnmt3a with the exception that no protease inhibitors were added (12Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis revealed masses of the M + H+ ions of 46631.0 and 46537.1 Da for Dnmt2 (Fig. 1B) and the Dnmt2 mutant (data not shown), respectively. These values are within experimental accuracy identical to the corresponding theoretical masses (46629.7 and 46538.6 Da) calculated after removal of the initial Met residue. A mock Dnmt2 preparation was carried out using BL21 Rosetta(DE3) pLysS cells containing the pET28a + vector without the Dnmt2 insert. Mass Spectrometry—Molecular masses were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Vision 2000 mass spectrometer (Finnegan MAT, Bremen, Germany). The protein samples were de-salted using Centricon-30 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution (9 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 1 mg of 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid/ml, 0.1% (v/v) TFA, 30% (v/v) acetonitrile) and allowed to air-dry. Ions were generated by irradiation with a pulsed nitrogen laser (emission wavelength: 337 nm; laser power density: ∼106 watts cm–2), and positive ions were accelerated and detected in the reflector mode. Spectra were calibrated using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as external standard. DNA and Oligodeoxynucleotides—Purified oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). DNA methylation experiments were carried out with a 558-mer PCR fragment derived from pAT153 that contains 34 CG sites. The fragment was produced by PCR and purified over PCR spin columns (Qiagen), and its concentration was determined from A 260 nm. DNA Methylation Reactions—For the DNA methylation reactions, 1–2 μg of DNA was incubated with 10 μm Dnmt2 in 40 μl of methylation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm AdoMet (Sigma) for 16 h at ambient temperature. After the methylation reactions, DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction or by passing over PCR spin prep columns (Qiagen). As a negative control, the DNA was incubated at the same condition with the same dilution of a Dnmt2 mock preparation. As positive control, the DNA was modified using 16 units of M.SssI (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. HPLC Separation of Nucleosides—HPLC separation of the nucleosides was carried out basically as described previously (19Gowher H. Leismann O. Jeltsch A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6918-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 25Jeltsch A. Christ F. Fatemi M. Roth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19538-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Gowher H. Ehrlich K.C. Jeltsch A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 205: 151-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA (1–2 μg) was degraded to nucleosides using 2 μg of P1 nuclease (Sigma), 1.5 μg of Serratia marcescens nuclease (∼1500 units), and 2 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Biosciences). The S. marcescens nuclease was kindly provided by G. Meiss (Institut für Biochemie, Giessen, Germany). It is also commercially available as Benzonase from Merck. Subsequently, 0.1–1 μg of the DNA was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC column Apex 1-octadecylsilyl(C-18), 5-μm-particle size (Jones Chromatography, Llanbradach, Wales), equilibrated with buffer A (100 mm triethylammonium acetate, pH 6.5). HPLC runs were performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at ambient temperature using a biphasic linear gradient consisting of buffers A and B (100 mm triethylammonium acetate, pH 6.5, 30% acetonitrile): t = 0 min, 0% buffer B; t = 20 min, 15% buffer B; t = 40 min, 100% buffer B; and t = 50 min, 100% buffer B. As reference, a synthetic oligonucleotide containing 5-methylcytosine was used. Either peaks corresponding to cytidine, methylcytidine, thymine, adenosine, or guanosine were collected or fractions were collected for 30-s intervals during the entire run. The fractions were dried in vacuum, dissolved in water and reevaporated twice, and finally dissolved in 15 μl of water. Two-dimensional TLC Analysis—Labeling of the deoxynucleosides in the HPLC fractions and two-dimensional TLC analysis were carried out essentially as previously described (19Gowher H. Leismann O. Jeltsch A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6918-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 26Gowher H. Ehrlich K.C. Jeltsch A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 205: 151-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2 μl of the HPLC samples were incubated with 30 nm deoxynucleoside kinase (kindly provided by H. Gowher, Institut für Biochemie, Giessen, Germany) in 15-μl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 0.25 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (370 MBq/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h at 37 °C. 2 μl of the radioactive sample were applied to cellulose TLC plates (Cellulose CEL 400-10, 20 × 20 cm, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) at ambient temperature. The first dimension was run in isobutyric acid/water/ammonia (66:33:1, v/v/v). The plate was dried in air and developed in the second dimension with isopropyl alcohol/concentrated HCl/water (70:15:15, v/v/v). The plate was dried, and the radioactivity was analyzed using an instant imager (Canberra Packard). Bisulfite Sequencing Analysis—Bisulfite sequencing was carried out as described previously (27Grunau C. Renault E. Rosenthal A. Roizes G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Warnecke P.M. Stirzaker C. Song J. Grunau C. Melki J.R. Clark S.J. Methods. 2002; 27: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Purified methylated or unmethylated DNA (20 ng) was incubated NaOH (0.3 m) for 15 min at 37 °C, sodium metabisulfite and hydroquinone were added to final concentrations of 2.4 m and 0.5 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 16 h at 55 °C. The DNA was purified over PCR spin columns and incubated with NaOH (0.3 m) for 15 min at 37 °C. The solution was neutralized by the addition of ammonium acetate, pH 7, and precipitated with ethanol. The lower strand of the converted DNA was amplified by PCR using TaqDNA polymerase and cloned using TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen). Finally, 50 clones of the DNA incubated with Dnmt2 and 50 clones of the control DNA were sequenced. We have cloned human Dnmt2 into a bacterial expression vector and expressed and purified the protein to homogeneity (Fig. 1A). A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the mass of the protein within the experimental error (experimental mass of M + H+: 46631.0 Da; theoretical mass: 46629.7 Da) (Fig. 1B). No significant peaks were detected at higher masses. This result shows that the purified protein does not carry covalently bound nucleotides or DNA. The protein was incubated with different radioactively labeled DNA fragments generated by PCR in the absence of cofactor as well as in the presence of AdoMet or S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and analyzed on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. However, no covalent complex with DNA could be detected (data not shown). This result suggests that the covalent complex formation reported previously (21Dong A. Yoder J.A. Zhang X. Zhou L. Bestor T.H. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) might occur only with special DNA sequences. HPLC/TLC Activity Assay—The catalytic activity of Dnmt2 was investigated using λ-DNA or a PCR fragment derived from pAT153 plasmid and radioactive [methyl-3H]AdoMet. In addition, restriction protection studies were performed using several restriction endonucleases sensitive to methylation of cytosine residues. However, in agreement with previous studies (10Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 17Yoder J.A. Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 18Van den Wyngaert I. Sprengel J. Kass S.U. Luyten W.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Dong A. Yoder J.A. Zhang X. Zhou L. Bestor T.H. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), no catalytic activity could be detected. Because we have used purified Dnmt2 enzyme at high concentrations in these assays, this result indicates that the specific activity of Dnmt2 is severalfold lower than that of Dnmt1 (9Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) or Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b (10Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 12Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, there are several possible explanations for this negative result, because the sensitivity of tritium transfer assays is limited and many DNA MTases carry tightly bound cofactor after purification. Bound cofactor interferes with the tritium transfer assay, in particular, if high amounts of the purified enzyme are used, which is required if low activities are to be detected. In addition, the conclusions that can be drawn from restriction protection experiments are restricted because methylation can only be detected if the recognition sequence of the restriction enzyme overlaps with that of the MTase. Therefore, we have also investigated the activity of Dnmt2 using an HPLC/TLC assay that is very sensitive and general (19Gowher H. Leismann O. Jeltsch A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6918-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 26Gowher H. Ehrlich K.C. Jeltsch A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 205: 151-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was methylated in vitro and hydrolyzed to nucleosides, and the nucleosides were separated by HPLC. The nucleosides then were labeled with deoxynucleoside kinase (dNK) using [γ-32P]ATP, and the nature of each nucleotide was confirmed by two-dimensional TLC. As shown with methylated reference DNA, 5-methylcytidine elutes from the HPLC column after 12.9 min (Fig. 2). The elution profile of the nucleosides from the HPLC column was monitored by UV spectroscopy at 260 nm. No 5-methylcytidine peak was detectable with DNA after incubation with Dnmt2 and AdoMet, indicating that the level of cytosine methylation was below 1%. Therefore, the material eluting from the column around the elution time of the 5-methylcytidine was collected (11.5′-14′), and the nucleosides were labeled using dNK and subjected to two-dimensional TLC (Fig. 3). The position of the mC on the two-dimensional TLC plate is shown in Fig. 3A using M.SssI-modified DNA. However, also in the DNA incubated with Dnmt2, a clear mC spot was detected (Fig. 3B). The additional spots present in the TLCs shown in Fig. 3 correspond to C and T, which appear in the tails of the much larger HPLC peaks of the major components of the DNA. A guanine spot is not detected, because the dNK has a preference for pyrimidines (29Johansson M. van Rompay A.R. Degreve B. Balzarini J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23814-23819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). No mC was detected in DNA not incubated with a DNA MTase (data not shown).Fig. 3Two-dimensional TLC detection of 5-methylcytosine. 1 μg of DNA was incubated with M.SssI DNA MTase (A), Dnmt2 (B), or Dnmt2 mock preparation (C) degraded to nucleosides and subjected to HPLC analysis. Fractions were collected between 11.5′ and 14′, labeled with dNK, and analyzed by two-dimensional TLC. The positions of the ATP and the individual nucleosides as indicated in A were determined in independent experiments (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To rule out that the methylation might be due to a contamination of the Dnmt2 preparation, Dnmt2 was expressed in Escherichia coli cells that do not contain a DNA-(Cytosine-C5) MTase. In addition, a control purification was carried out using the same cells containing the same vector without Dnmt2 insert. Cells were grown and harvested exactly as the expression cells, and the cell extract was applied to affinity chromatography under the same conditions as the Dnmt2 crude cell extract. The target DNA was incubated with the same volumes of the mock purification as used in the Dnmt2 methylation experiments and subjected to the same assay procedure as the DNA incubated with Dnmt2. However, no mC was detectable (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that the methylation activity is attributed to the Dnmt2 protein. To confirm the nature of the 5-methylcytosine in an additional experiment, we collected fractions every 30 s to follow the elution profile of the compound from the HPLC column. As shown in Fig. 4, the mC peak was observed between 12 and 13 min exactly as expected from the absorbance profile of the HPLC run with the reference DNA. To estimate the amount of 5-methylcytosine in the original DNA, we have added defined amounts of cytosine to the HPLC samples and compared the peak intensities of cytidine and 5-methylcytidine. On the basis of these titrations, the amount of 5-methylcytosine in the original DNA could be estimated, yielding a ratio of 5-methylcytosine/cytosine of roughly 1:150 (0.7%) as compared with 1:16–1:12 (6–8%) as observed in human DNA from natural sources. As additional control, a Dnmt2 variant was prepared in which the highly conserved active site residues Cys-79 and Glu-119 were exchanged by Ala. The variant was purified, and its identity was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (experimental mass of M + H+: 46537.1 Da; theoretical mass: 46538.6 Da). After incubation of the DNA with the active site variant, a much lower amount of 5-methylcytosine was detected (Fig. 5). A quantitative analysis revealed that the amount of 5-methylcytosine obtained after incubation with the Dnmt2 variant was >10-fold lower than the amount obtained with Dnmt2. This result demonstrates that the active site residues of Dnmt2 are important for catalysis, confirming the conclusion that Dnmt2 is an active DNA MTase. Because in the Dnmt2 variant the two most important catalytic residues are removed, one might have expected a larger reduction in activity. However, we recently obtained similar results with the Dnmt3a MTase where also residual activity was detectable even after the removal of these residues (30Reither S. Li F. Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This result indicates that in addition to the established catalytic mechanism DNA MTases also have other means to accelerate the methylation reaction such as correct positioning of the flipped base and the cofactor and binding to the transition state of methyl group transfer. Bisulfite Sequencing Activity Assay—To investigate the catalytic activity of Dnmt2 with an independent assay, DNA was incubated with Dnmt2 in vitro and then subjected to bisulfite treatment (31Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar, 32Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). This procedure converts all of the cytosine residues to uracil, giving rise to thymine after amplification by PCR. Only methylated cytosines are refractory to the deamination. Bisulfite-treated DNA was cloned, and 44 clones were sequenced (∼350 nucleotides/clone) (Supplemental Fig. 1). As a control, 41 clones of DNA incubated with the Dnmt2 mock preparation were sequenced. In the Dnmt2-treated DNA, 24 cytosine residues were detected in comparison to 11 in the control DNA (Table 1). However, because of polymerase errors in the PCR of the bisulfite-treated DNA, not all of these cytosines correspond to methylated cytosines in the original DNA. Eight of the cytosines detected in the control DNA and nine in the Dnmt2-treated DNA were observed at positions corresponding to a thymine in the original DNA. Thus, these cytosines must have been introduced by polymerase errors, which cannot be avoided, because TaqDNA polymerase must be used to amplify uracil-containing DNA (28Warnecke P.M. Stirzaker C. Song J. Grunau C. Melki J.R. Clark S.J. Methods. 2002; 27: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In addition, three cytosines in the control DNA occur at positions corresponding to cytosine in the original DNA. Because the control was not methylated, they can be the result of incomplete deamination during bisulfite treatment or polymerase errors after successful conversion of the original cytosine to uracil. However, the distribution of cytosines observed at the position of T or C in the original DNA is highly biased, whereas in the control DNA only three cytosines were observed at positions corresponding to a cytosine in the original DNA. In the Dnmt2-treated DNA, 15 cytosines were found at such sites. This distribution of cytosines found at the place of cytosine versus cytosine found at the place of thymine (15:9 for Dnmt2-treated DNA but 3:8 for the control DNA) cannot be due to statistical fluctuations (p = 1.1 × 10–4) and is a strong indication that Dnmt2 is an active DNA MTase. Since we observed 15 5-methylcytosine residues in the 44 clones sequenced, the ratio of 5-methylcytosine/cytosine can be estimated to be 1:250 on the basis of the bisulfite sequencing assay, close to what has been concluded from the results of the HPLC/TLC assay.Table IResults of the bisulfite sequencing methylation analysisDnmt2Controln Seq4441n C (at C)153n C (at T)98 Open table in a new tab We have analyzed the sequences flanking the 15 positions where methylation has been observed in the bisulfite analysis. Because in the control DNA, three cytosines were observed that resulted from polymerase errors or incomplete conversion of the DNA, up to three or four cytosines of the Dnmt2-treated DNA also could be the result of this effect. Therefore, one cannot expect a fully defined recognition sequence. The most significant deviation of the distribution of the occurrence of A, T, G, and C from a random distribution was seen at position +1 with respect to the cytosine where a G is highly favored (p = 0.019). This result shows that Dnmt2, similar to all of the other mammalian DNA methyltransferases identified so far, prefers methylation of CG sites. At all of the other positions, smaller flanking sequence preferences are observed. If one considers an occurrence of 6 in 15 as significant (2-fold overrepresentation), the following preferences can be derived. At positions –3 and –2, a preference for T is observed. At position –1, no significant preference for any base occurs. At position +2, G is over-represented, and at position +3, A is most common base. At position +4, G and A are enriched. Therefore, a consensus sequence of ttnCGga(g/a) can be derived for Dnmt2 from our data (Table II). It is interesting to note that Dnmt2 might recognize its CG target site in a palindromic TTCCGGAA sequence context. However, the small number of methylated sequences analyzed so far precludes a final statement on the specificity of Dnmt2, and the consensus sequence might be modified and sharpened as a result of further studies.Table IIConsensus sequence for DNA methylation by Dnmt2 Genome projects have provided a wealth of sequencing data for many species including man and mice. For example, in human DNA, ∼30,000–40,000 genes have been found (33Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17994) Google Scholar, 34Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. Li P.W. Mural R.J. Sutton G.G. Smith H.O. Yandell M. Evans C.A. Holt R.A. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10698) Google Scholar). However, in many cases, the functions of the genes identified are unknown. For example, approximately one-third of the predicted proteins in the S. cerevisiae genome does not show clear homology to any protein of known function. For another one-third of all genes, hypotheses for the functions of proteins can be derived on the basis of amino acid sequence homology (35Casari G. De Daruvar A. Sander C. Schneider R. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 244-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Dujon B. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 263-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). One example of a human protein belonging to the second group is Dnmt2, which shows clear cut amino acid sequence similarity to DNA-(Cytosine-C5) MTases and also has a structure closely resembling the common structure of enzymes from this class. Nevertheless, catalytic activity of Dnmt2 could not been detected by several groups. Therefore, the function of Dnmt2 as DNA MTases has been questioned. Using a combined HPLC/TLC assay that is very sensitive and specific, we show here that Dnmt2 is an active DNA MTase. Its low in vitro activity explains the failure to detect activity in previous studies and may in part explain the weak phenotype observed after deletion of Dnmt2 in mice. After sequencing many clones of bisulfite-treated DNA modified by Dnmt2 and statistical analysis of the results, we could define a loose consensus sequence for Dnmt2 (ttnCGga(g/a)) showing that Dnmt2 also modifies DNA at CG residues similar to all of the other mammalian DNA MTases identified so far. Therefore, the other MTases might compensate for the function of Dnmt2, which also could explain the weak knock-out phenotype. The consensus sequence rules out that the enzyme recognizes CCWGG sites as suggested by the fact that this sequence specificity has been reported for a mutant of the S. pombe Dnmt2 homolog pmt1 (37Pinarbasi E. Elliott J. Hornby D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and by the observation that CCWGG methylation has been detected in mammals (cf. Ref. 38Lorincz M.C. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10034-10036Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and references therein). However, CCWGG is the recognition sequence for the E. coli dcm MTase, which might have caused the CCWGG methylation activity observed in the recombinant protein preparation of the pmt1 variant. The CCWGG methylation identified in human DNA could be attributed to other enzymes, like Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b, which also methylate DNA at non-CG sites (12Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 39Aoki A. Suetake I. Miyagawa J. Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 289: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence derived from the in vitro methylation reactions (ttnCGga(g/a)) overlaps with the general target site of ets-transcription factors (GGA(G/A)), which have important roles in regulation of gene expression in different signaling pathways and interact with many other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation (for review see Ref. 41Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Since it has already been shown that CG methylation inhibits DNA binding by different ets-transcription factors (42Umezawa A. Yamamoto H. Rhodes K. Klemsz M.J. Maki R.A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 43Guo Y. Pakneshan P. Gladu J. Slack A. Szyf M. Rabbani S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41571-41579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the consensus sequence suggests that Dnmt2 could be involved in the regulation of DNA binding and transactivation by an ets-transcription factor. Therefore, Dnmt2 possibly has a more specialized role in vivo than the other known mammalian DNA MTases. Finally, it should be noted that Dnmt2 is the only mammalian DNA MTase that does not have a large N-terminal domain, which usually is involved in the targeting and regulation of the MTases. It is interesting to note that Dnmt1, which is highly active in vitro, is not active after removal of the N-terminal part (9Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytic domain of Dnmt1 depends on activation by the N-terminal domain. It is possible that an activator protein for Dnmt2 is present in certain tissues where it could play the role of the N-terminal part in Dnmt1 and stimulate the activity of Dnmt2. However, it should be mentioned that the catalytic domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are active in the absence of the N-terminal parts of the proteins (44Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20409-20414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), demonstrating that not all of the mammalian MTases require an N-terminal part for activity.

https://openalex.org/W2012641545,"Tensile experiments of fully dense nanocrystalline structures with a mean grain size of less than 100 nanometers demonstrate a considerable increase in hardness but a remarkable drop in elongation-to-failure, indicating brittle behavior. However, dimple structures are often observed at the fracture surface, indicating some type of ductile fracture mechanism. Guided by large-scale atomistic simulations, we propose that these dimple structures result from local shear planes formed around clustered grains that, because of their particular misorientation, cannot participate in the grain boundary accommodation processes necessary to sustain plastic deformation. This raises the expectation that general high-angle grain boundaries are necessary for good ductility."
https://openalex.org/W1971687277,"Adrenoceptors (ARs), members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, form the interface between the sympathetic nervous system and the cardiovascular system, with integral roles in the rapid regulation of myocardial function. However, in heart failure, chronic catecholamine stimulation of adrenoceptors has been linked to pathologic cardiac remodeling, including myocyte apoptosis and hypertrophy. In cardiac myocytes, activation of AR subtypes results in coupling to different G proteins and induction of specific signaling pathways, which is partly regulated by the subtype-specific distribution of receptors in plasma membrane compartments containing distinct complexes of signaling molecules. The Connections Maps of the Adrenergic and Myocyte Adrenergic Signaling Pathways bring into focus the specific signaling pathways of individual AR subtypes and their relevant functions in vivo."

The evolutionary conservation and the ubiquitous expression in mammalian tissues of the prohibitin complex suggest an important function among eukaryotes. The PHB complex has been shown to play a role in the stabilization of newly synthesized subunits of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have used Caenorhabditis elegans as model system to study the role of the PHB complex during development of a multicellular organism. We demonstrate that prohibitins in C. elegans form a high molecular weight complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane similar to that of yeast and humans. By using RNA-mediated gene inactivation, we show that PHB proteins are essential during embryonic development and are required for somatic and germline differentiation in the larval gonad. We further demonstrate that a deficiency in PHB proteins results in altered mitochondrial biogenesis in body wall muscle cells.

In mammalian and yeast cells, it has been demonstrated that PHB proteins associate with each other to form a high molecular weight complex (the PHB complex) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (5Steglich G.

Grivell L.A. Coates P.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar for a review), such as a role in cell cycle regulation (8McClung J.K. Danner D.B.

A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), these functions are difficult to reconcile with the exclusive localization of mammalian PHB proteins to mitochondria (1Ikonen E. Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 3Coates P.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, studies on the yeast PHB complex have provided convincing evidence for a direct role in mitochondrial function. The PHB complex has been found to co-purify with the m-AAA (matrix-ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities) protease, and a role as a negative regulator of the protease has been proposed (5Steglich G. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3435-3442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast PHB proteins are capable of stabilizing newly synthesized mitochondrially encoded proteins through direct interaction, suggesting a role in mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly (5Steglich G. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3435-3442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). We have suggested a role for PHB proteins in the biogenesis of mitochondria as a holdase/unfoldase type of protein specifically required in situations of metabolic stress (6Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Based on structural data from chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, we predict a barrel-like structure for the yeast PHB complex, in the cavity of which mitochondrial products might be held (14Back J.W. Sanz M.A. De Jong L. De Koning L.J. Nijtmans L.G. De Koster C.G. Grivell L.A. Van Der Spek H. Muijsers A.O. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2471-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). At the phenotypic level, disruption of PHB genes in yeast results in a shortening of the replicative life span due to premature aging (3Coates P.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This shortening of life span contrasts with the lack of an observable growth phenotype under laboratory conditions. However, deletion of PHB genes is lethal in combination with mutations of the mitochondrial inheritance machinery (4Berger K.H. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4043-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), of the AAA-mitochondrial proteases (5Steglich G. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3435-3442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or of the mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthetic machinery (15Birner R. Nebauer R. Schneiter R. Daum G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 370-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The lack of a clear growth phenotype in yeast PHB mutants might reflect a redundancy in assembly factors. Alternatively, PHB mutations may have a stronger phenotype in organisms or tissues with a greater dependence on mitochondrial energy generation. In support of this latter hypothesis, deletion of a PHB homologue in Drosophila melanogaster results in lethality during larval development (16Eveleth Jr., D.D. Marsh J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6169-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that PHB proteins are essential during one or more steps in the differentiation of multicellular organisms. In this study, we have used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study the role of PHB proteins during organismal development. First, we demonstrate by blue native electrophoresis (BNE) 1The abbreviations used are: BNE, blue native electrophoresis; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference; RT, reverse transcription; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MRC, mitochondrial respiratory chain.1The abbreviations used are: BNE, blue native electrophoresis; RNAi, RNA-mediated interference; RT, reverse transcription; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MRC, mitochondrial respiratory chain. that PHB proteins in the nematode form a high molecular weight complex in the mitochondrial membrane similar to that observed in yeast and humans (6Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Second, by using RNA-mediated interference (RNAi), we monitor the effects of depleting PHB proteins at different developmental stages. Depletion of PHB proteins during embryogenesis results in developmental arrest. When PHB levels are depleted during postembryonic development, several somatic and germline effects are observed. Germline defects range from sterility to severely reduced brood sizes with a high incidence of embryonic lethality of the progeny. Somatic defects include a reduced body size and a morphologically abnormal somatic gonad. A direct link to mitochondrial dysfunction is demonstrated by the severely altered mitochondrial morphology observed in body wall muscle cells of phb(RNAi) animals. We find a slightly but significantly reduced oxygen consumption rate in phb(RNAi)-treated worms compared with control worms. In addition, we show that PHB protein contents are elevated in situations of altered mitochondrial metabolism, such as when imbalances in respiratory enzyme subunits occur, as has been reported in other systems (6Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 17Nijtmans L.G. Artal Sanz M.

In strong contrast to the yeast situation, we report a severe loss of function phenotype for depletion of the mitochondrial PHB complex during organismal development. Our results show that C. elegans serves as a useful model organism for the study of mitochondrial metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis and in better understanding mitochondrial diseases. Strains and Conditions—Worms were cultured at room temperature (∼22 °C) unless otherwise noted (19Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). C. elegans strains used were N2 Bristol wild-type strain and glo-1(zu391). Sequence Comparisons and Alignments—Percentage identities and similarities between human, C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae PHB proteins were obtained from the Incyte Genomics database. Human PHB1 protein shares 66/83 and 50/68% identity/similarity with the predicted C. elegans genes Y37E3.9 and T24H7.1, respectively. Y37E3.9 shares 53/79 and 50/71% identity/similarity with the yeast PHB1 and PHB2 proteins, respectively, whereas T24H7.1 shares 53/75% and 48/71% identity/similarity with the yeast PHB2 and PHB1 proteins, respectively. Amino acid sequences were obtained from SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL. Accession numbers were as follows: PHB_HUMAN, Swiss-Prot P35232; PHB2_HUMAN, TrEMBL Q99623; Y37E3.9, TrEMBL Q9BKU4; T24H7.1, Swiss-Prot P50093. GenBank™ accession numbers were as follows: PHB_HUMAN, NP_002625.1; PHB2_HUMAN, NP_009204; Y37E3.9, AAK27865.1; T24H7.1, AAA68353.1. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW. RNA Interference—For phb-2(RNAi) a 1.9-kb PCR product, amplified using N2 genomic DNA as a template with primers Phb2-F (5′-CGCATGGTATTTCCTGAGTAGG-3′) and Phb2-R (5′-CTCTCTTCAAAATGCCAACCC-3′), was digested with BstBI and SalI, and the 1.06-kb fragment was cloned into XhoI/ClaI-digested pBluescript II SK and pBC-KS (PDI BioScience, Aurora, Canada) to place the gene fragment under the control of the T7 promoter in both the forward and reverse orientations. The constructs were co-transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21-SI (Invitrogen), which contains an integrated T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of the salt-inducible proU promoter. Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in LBON medium (1% bactotryptone, 0.5% yeast extract) containing appropriate antibiotics. Expression of constructs was induced with 0.2 m NaCl. For phb-1(RNAi), a 0.8-kb fragment was amplified using N2 genomic DNA as template with primers Phb1-F (5′-CAATGTTGATGGAGGTCAACG-3′) and Phb1-R (5′-GGTGACATTCTTGTTCTTGGC-3′). A 0.627-kb SacI/EcoRV fragment was cloned into likewise digested pBluescript II SK and pBC-KS. Empty vectors were used as controls. N2 L4 hermaphrodites were fed bacteria expressing sense and antisense RNAs or bacteria containing empty vectors on plates containing 0.2 m salt. Animals were transferred onto freshly seeded plates every 24 h. Offspring were analyzed 24 h after transfer. For monitoring postembryonic development, gravid adults were bleached, and the embryos were allowed to hatch overnight on unseeded plates. Starved L1 larvae were transferred to plates containing 0.2 m salt and seeded with bacteria expressing PHB-RNAs or containing empty vectors. RT-PCR—Total RNA from embryos was prepared as follows. Approximately 60 gravid hermaphrodites were picked when RNAi showed the highest effectiveness (after 72 h of feeding) from salt-induced vector control plates or from salt-induced RNAi plates and dissolved in a 1:10 solution of bleach in 1 m NaOH. Embryos were collected and washed twice in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K). Samples were incubated at 55 °C for 1 h and processed further using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O. For each RT-PCR, 2 μl of RNA was used. RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript™ One-Step™ RT-PCR system (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. To test the efficiency of the RNAi treatment by RT-PCR, reactions were prepared from control and phb-2(RNAi)-treated embryos. phb-1 (Y37E3.9) and phb-2 (T24H7.1) RNA levels were normalized using the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (F35G12.2). After 30 cycles of amplification, products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primers used for RT-PCR analysis were designed using the predicted cDNA sequences: Idh-F, 5′-AGCAACGTCCTCGGTCATAC-3′; Idh-R, 5′-GATGAACGCAGTTGGATTGG-3′; Phb1-F, 5′-CAATGTTGATGGAGGTCAACG-3′; Phb1-R, 5′-GGTGACATTCTTGTTCTTGGC-3′; Phb2-F, 5′-GGACACCGAGCTATCATGTTC-3′; Phb2-R, 5′-CAACATCAATCCTCCTGTTGG-3′. For phb-1(RNAi), RT-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from the same number of young adults fed dsRNA from the L1 stage. Electrophoresis and Western Blot—For BNE/two-dimensional PAGE, mitochondrial membrane fractions were prepared as described (20Ishii N. Fujii M. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanase S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, young adult worms were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min and washed with M9 buffer three times and once with MSM-E buffer (21Kayser E.B. Morgan P.G. Hoppel C.L. Sedensky M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20551-20558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 10% (w/v) MSM-E buffer containing a proteinase-inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and cells were disrupted with a Teflon homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 23,500 × g for 30 min, and the pellet containing submitochondrial particles was resuspended in BNE extraction buffer containing 1.5% lauryl maltoside. Two-dimensional PAGE was performed as described (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) using 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, worm pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and the proteins were resolved on 10% gels (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose, and immunoreactive material was visualized by chemiluminescent detection (ECL™; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pharyngeal Pumping and Defecation Measurements—Synchronized animals were placed on nematode growth media plates containing 0.2 m salt seeded with BL21-SI bacteria producing phb-1 or phb-2 RNAs or containing empty vectors and raised at 15, 20, or 25 °C. Animals were scored for pharyngeal pumping and defecation in their first day of fertility. To score fertility, 70 L4-staged animals were transferred individually to fresh plates. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance tests. Oxygen Consumption Rate—Oxygen consumption rates were measured as previously described (24Braeckman B.P. Houthoofd K. De Vreese A. Vanfleteren J.R. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using a Clark-type electrode (Rank Bros. Ltd., Bottisham, Cambridge, UK) with some minor modifications. Young adult worms fed either RNA-expressing bacteria or control bacteria were washed and collected in S-basal buffer. Approximately 100 μl of slurry pellet of worms were delivered into the chamber in 3 ml of S-basal medium. The chamber was kept at 25 °C, and measurements were done for 5–15 min, depending on the oxygen consumption rate. The slope of the straight portion of the plot was used to derive the oxygen consumption rate. Worms were recovered after respiration measurements and collected for protein quantification. Rates were normalized to protein content. We performed 10 independent measurements per strain. Statistic analysis was performed with an analysis of variance test followed by a least square deviation post hoc test. Mitochondrial Morphology—Mitochondrial morphology was monitored in glo-1(zu391) mutant worms, which have little or no gut granule autofluorescence 2G. J. Hermann and J. R. Priess, unpublished observations. expressing the Pmyo-3::mito::GFP construct (25Labrousse A.M. Zappaterra M.D. Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and the transformation marker pRF4 rol-6(su1006). Morphology was monitored by laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Doxycycline Treatment—Synchronized L1 hermaphrodites were transferred to plates containing 40 μg/ml doxycycline. Worms were collected after 72 h for Western blot analysis. Antibodies—A polyclonal antibody raised against the 25 C-terminal amino acids of the murine PHB1 protein has been previously described (3Coates P.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody against the yeast β subunit of F1-ATPase was a gift from Prof. Jan Berden. Anti-actin antibody was obtained from ICN (clone C4) and used at a dilution of 1:10.000. Microscopy—Animals were mounted on 2% agarose pads and observed under a Zeiss Axioskop-2 research microscope with a SPOT-2 digital camera (Carl Zeiss Canada Ltd., Calgary, Canada) or a Zeiss Axiocam camera. GFP images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. C. elegans Contains a Conserved PHB Complex in the Mitochondrial Inner Membrane—The C. elegans sequence data base contains two predicted genes, Y37E3.9 and T24H7.1, having extensive sequence identity with the yeast PHB1 and PHB2 genes (26The C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3548) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparisons with the human and yeast PHB proteins identify Y37E3.9 and T24H7.1 as being orthologs of PHB1 and PHB2, respectively (see “Materials and Methods” for details). A sequence alignment of human and C. elegans PHB proteins is shown in Fig. 1A. We propose to name Y37E3.9 phb-1 and T24H7.1 phb-2 in order to follow the previously proposed convention (7Nijtmans L.G. Artal S.M. Grivell L.A. Coates P.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). For the corresponding proteins, we will use the nomenclature PHB-1 and PHB-2. When necessary, gene and protein names can be preceded by letters specifying the species (e.g. cephb-1 and cePHB-1 for the C. elegans gene and protein, respectively). It has been previously shown that together the PHB proteins form a high molecular weight complex with an estimated size of 1 MDa in the mitochondrial inner membrane of yeast and humans (6Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To determine the size of the C. elegans PHB complex, mitochondrial membrane extracts were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). In the first dimension, membrane protein complexes are separated by blue native electrophoresis according to their size. In the second dimension, denaturing SDS-PAGE separates protein complexes into their subunits (Fig. 2A). Western blots of this gel were immunostained with the polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus (last 25 amino acids) of the murine PHB1 protein (APP-2) (3Coates P.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2B, the PHB1 antibody cross-reacts with bands of 30 and 32 kDa after separation in the second dimension, the lower immunoreactive band (30 kDa) being of higher intensity. The predicted sizes for cePHB-1 (275 amino acids) and cePHB-2 (286 amino acids) are 30 and 31.8 kDa, respectively. Because the preimmune serum does not recognize these bands (data not shown) and the migration of the protein complex in the first dimension is similar to the migration of the yeast and human PHB complexes (6Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), we believe the 30- and 32-kDa immunoreactive bands correspond to cePHB-1 and cePHB-2 (additional evidence is presented below; see “Discussion”). This demonstrates that in C. elegans the PHB proteins form a large mitochondrial complex similar to PHB complexes of other systems (6Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The TMHMM algorithm (27Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8747) Google Scholar) suggests a transmembrane helix for cePHB-2 (positions 12–34), whereas no transmembrane region is predicted for cePHB-1. This is in agreement with topology predictions for the yeast PHB proteins (14Back J.W. Sanz M.A. De Jong L. De Koning L.J. Nijtmans L.G. De Koster C.G. Grivell L.A. Van Der Spek H. Muijsers A.O. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2471-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The yeast PHB proteins are imported into mitochondria without the cleavage of an N-terminal leader peptide (6Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Given that the observed protein sizes on SDS-PAGE correlate well with the predicted molecular weight of the mature proteins and given the sequence homology with yeast (data not shown), it is tempting to believe that the C. elegans PHB proteins are also imported to mitochondria without cleavage of a large N-terminal leader peptide and that the predicted transmembrane region of cePHB-2 is present in the mature protein as incorporated in the complex. PHB Proteins Are Essential during Embryonic Development—RNAi is the phenomenon in which introduction of dsRNA results in potent and specific inactivation of the corresponding gene through the degradation of endogenous mRNA (28Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11430) Google Scholar, 29Bass B.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 235-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). RNAi mediated by the ingestion of bacteria producing sense and antisense RNAs has proven to be a powerful tool in the analysis of gene function in C. elegans (30Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Zipperlen P. Martinez-Campos M. Sohrmann M. Ahringer J. Nature. 2000; 408: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 31Kamath, R. S., Martinez-Campos, M., Zipperlen, P., Fraser, A. G., and Ahringer, J. (2001) Genome Biol., 2, Research: 0002.1–0002.10Google Scholar). We performed RNAi by feeding worms E. coli engineered to express sense and antisense RNAs corresponding to the predicted exon-rich genomic sequences of both cephb-1 and cephb-2 (Fig. 1B). L4-staged hermaphrodites were placed onto plates seeded with bacteria producing phb-dsRNA or bacteria containing empty vectors. The hermaphrodites were transferred to fresh seeded plates every 24 h, and the progeny remaining on the plate were scored 24 h later. RNAi for phb-1, phb-2, or phb-1+2 resulted in ∼60–70% embryonic arrest (Fig. 3A). Brood sizes of phb(RNAi) animals were slightly reduced compared with controls. Embryonic lethality was scored under salt-induced and noninduced conditions. No embryonic arrest was observed with vector controls (Fig. 3A) or in the absence of salt (data not shown). The development of affected embryos was followed by light microscopy. A developmental delay was observed in RNAi-treated embryos when compared with controls (Fig. 3B). Developmental arrest ranged from the gastrula to the 1.5-fold stages (data not shown). This variability may reflect differences in the efficiency of RNAi in each embryo. PHB Proteins Are Required for Germline Function—RNAi allows the postembryonic depletion of gene transcripts essential for embryonic development. When L1-staged larvae were fed phb-1 and/or phb-2 dsRNA, they showed a delay in development. Control worms reached adulthood 48 h after starting feeding and laid most of their offspring between 48 and 72 h, whereas phb(RNAi)-treated worms initiated egg laying after 72 h and only reached their peak of fertility between 72 and 96 h. Between 30 and 40% of phb-2(RNAi)-treated animals develop into sterile adults. Fertile adults had severely reduced brood sizes with a high incidence of mortality in the progeny (Fig. 4A). The postembryonic phenotypes were comparable for phb-1(RNAi), phb-2(RNAi), or phb-1+phb-2(RNAi) animals. RNAi-treated hermaphrodites were examined under the microscope, and somatic defects including a reduced body size and abnormal gonad morphology were observed. Most prominent are the reduced number of germ nuclei and their abnormal morphologies (Fig. 4B, c and f) and defective oogenesis (Fig. 4B, b, c, d, f, h, and i) and spermatogenesis that probably are responsible for the animals' sterility or severely reduced fertility. Accumulation of unfertilized oocytes in the uterus can also be seen (Fig. 4B, e). Abnormal embryos were also observed (data not shown). Specificity and Effectiveness of the RNAi Treatment—We analyzed the specificity and effectiveness of the RNAi treatment by RT-PCR and immunostaining. Embryos were collected from gravid hermaphrodites after feeding on phb-2 dsRNA for 48 h and RNA was extracted. The RT-PCR results show that phb-2 mRNA is greatly depleted in the RNAi-treated embryos, whereas mRNAs for phb-1 or for F35G12.2, a control gene encoding the mitochondrial NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase were present at levels comparable with untreated embryos (Fig. 5A). To test the specificity and efficiency of the phb-1-RNAi treatment during larval growth, L1-staged animals were fed phb-1 dsRNA and allowed to develop into young adults. The adults were collected and their RNA extracted. The RT-PCR results show that phb-1 mRNA is severely depleted, whereas mRNAs for phb-2 and for F35G12.2 are present at wild type levels (F"

Previous studies have implicated a sequence-recognition mechanism based on RNA-mediated interactions between nuclei in ciliated protozoa. In this study, we found that the process recognized and deleted a foreign gene integrated in a Tetrahymena chromosome, suggesting an unusual mechanism of genome surveillance. We further found that injection of double-stranded RNA into the cell at specific developmental stages triggers efficient deletion of the targeted genomic regions. Together the results indicate an RNA-based mechanism that directs genomewide DNA rearrangements and serves to disable invading genetic agents."

Their roles in development have been probed in fruit flies, nematodes, zebrafish, frogs, and mice. Some Wnts inhibit the degradation of β-catenin, which can regulate transcription of specific genes. Other Wnts exert their influences in other ways, such as increasing intracellular concentrations of Ca 2 + and decreasing intracellular concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding proteins (G proteins) and RGS proteins have been implicated in Wnt signaling. Wnt regulation of intracellular Ca 2 + and cGMP levels requires the G protein transducin and a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, which are major elements in signaling of the visual pathway."

Copper is an essential cofactor for enzymes that generate cellular energy, detoxify oxygen-derived radicals, mobilize iron, coagulate blood, and cross-link connective tissue. However, free copper is toxic because of its role in generating reactive oxygen species that can damage lipids, proteins, and DNA and is therefore highly regulated in the cell and implicated in several diseases (1Crichton R.R.

In Escherichia coli, three systems for copper tolerance have been identified, the chromosomally encoded cue (for Cu efflux) and cus (for Cu sensing) systems (5Outten F.W. Huffman D.L. Hale J.A. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30670-30677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), and the plasmid-encoded pco (for plasmid-borne copper resistance) (6Brown N.L. Barrett S.R. Camakaris J. Lee B.T. Rouch D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1153-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The cue system employs a cytosolic metalloregulatory protein, CueR, that induces expression of two proteins under conditions of copper stress, CopA and CueO. CopA is a copper efflux P-type ATPase that is located in the inner cell membrane (7Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and CueO is a periplasmic multicopper oxidase that is stimulated by exogenous copper(II) (8Outten F.W. Outten C.E. Hale J.

Disruption of the CueO gene renders cells more sensitive to copper (11Grass G. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2145-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), underlining its role in copper homeostasis. The cus system includes four proteins (CusCFBA) that are thought to allow copper transport directly from the periplasm across the outer membrane, and respond mainly to anaerobic copper stress (12Franke S. Grass G. Rensing C. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The pco system, like the cue system, contains a periplasmic multicopper oxidase (PcoA), a periplasmic copper binding protein (PcoC), and three other proteins (PcoBDE) (13Lee S.M. Grass G. Rensing C. Barrett S.R. Yates C.J.D. Stoyanov J.V. Brown N.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both the cue and pco systems rely on multicopper oxidases for copper tolerance; however, the functional role of these proteins remains unclear, as does the in vivo substrate. In general, multicopper oxidases couple four one-electron substrate oxidation steps to the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water (14Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin t.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). CueO can oxidize a range of substrates in vitro, including catechols, siderophores, and Fe(II) (10Kim C. Lorenz W.W. Hoopes J.T. Dean J.F.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4866-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and this activity is greatly enhanced in the presence of excess (∼100 μm) copper(II) ions (10Kim C. Lorenz W.W. Hoopes J.T. Dean J.F.D. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4866-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Roberts S.A. Weichsel A. Grass G. Thakali K. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Rensing C. Montfort W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2766-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), suggesting that binding of a labile copper is important for enzymatic activity. We recently determined the crystal structure of CueO at 1.4-Å resolution (15Roberts S.A. Weichsel A. Grass G. Thakali K. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Rensing C. Montfort W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2766-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and showed that its structure is similar to that of other multicopper oxidases, such as ascorbate oxidase (16Messerschmidt A.

As expected, CueO contains a T1 “blue copper” site, near the point at which the larger substrate is believed to bind, as well as a trinuclear copper center, where oxygen reduction occurs. However, CueO possesses a methionine-rich motif not found in these other proteins that could potentially be involved in copper binding. Portions of this motif (residues 356–371) are part of a helix lying near, and blocking access to, the T1 copper site (15Roberts S.A. Weichsel A. Grass G. Thakali K. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Rensing C. Montfort W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2766-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar); the remaining residues in the motif (380–402) are disordered in the structure. Methionine-rich regions are found in numerous proteins involved in copper homeostasis, leading to the suggestion that such regions are involved in copper binding (recently reviewed in Refs. 20Arnesano F.

Of these, Ctr1 (for copper transport protein 1) has been shown to require one or more MXXM motifs for activity in the yeast and human proteins (22Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and CopA has been shown to bind seven extra copper ions (23Cha J.S. Cooksey D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, PcoC and the related periplasmic protein CopC bind only one copper ion (20Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Thompsett A.R. Structure. 2002; 10: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Huffman D.L. Huyett J. Outten F.W. Doan P.E. Finney L.A. Hoffman B.M.

A. 1991; 88: 8915-8919Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The recently determined PcoC crystal structure displayed an interface between methionine-rich regions in adjacent molecules in the crystal, leading the authors to suggest that the role of such regions may be in protein-protein recognition, possibly between PcoC and PcoA, rather than in copper binding (24Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Finney L.A. Demeler B. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present work, we report the crystal structure of CueO bound to exogenous copper. We find a copper ion bound to the methionine-rich helix near the T1 center, ligated to residues required for copper tolerance. Mutations to the ligating residues yield reduced CueO oxidase activity in vitro and reduced copper tolerance in vivo. Protein Expression and Crystallization—Expression and purification of wild-type and mutant forms of CueO from E. coli strain BL21 (Stratagene) using Strep-TagII affinity chromatography and crystallization by the hanging drop method, were carried out as previously described (9Grass G. Rensing C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 902-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15Roberts S.A. Weichsel A. Grass G. Thakali K. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Rensing C. Montfort W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2766-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For data measurement, a crystal grown in 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, was soaked for 60 min in 10 mm CuCl2 and 30% polyethylene glycol, transferred to 50% polyethylene glycol 4000, picked up in a small loop (Hampton), and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Attempts to grow crystals in the presence of copper failed, and crystals that were placed in a solution made with CuSO4·5H2O dissolved. The crystal of the M441L mutant protein was grown by the same procedure. X-ray Data Measurement and Structural Refinement—For the CuCl2-soaked crystal, data were measured at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beam-line 9–2 and processed with D*TREK (25Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) (Table I). An anomalous difference Fourier electron density map calculated with phases from the CueO model with copper atoms deleted revealed the four expected copper sites, an additional highly occupied site near the T1 copper, and a partially occupied site on the surface of the protein. These atoms were added to the model and the structure refined with SHELX (26Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). Metal-ligand distances and angles were not restrained. Refinement cycles were interspersed with rebuilding using O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgard M. Acta Crystallogr.

Other programs of the CCP4 package (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Mutagenesis of cueO—Chromosomal DNA of E. coli strain W3110 was purified using Genomic-tips (Qiagen).

Cognate PCR fragments with introduced base pair changes were mixed, treated with DpnI to digest the dam-methylated template DNA, purified, and used for a second round of PCR with primers FW and REV. The mutated full-length cueO genes were purified, cut, and cloned into plasmid pASK-IBA3 (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) via the EcoRI and PstI restriction sites and transformed into E. coli XLI blue (Stratagene). The resulting plasmids expressed cueO-derivatives as C-terminal fusion proteins with the Strep-TagII epitope (SAWSHPNFEK), plus eight additional residues at the N terminus (GDRGPEF), which are removed along with the next 27 amino acids that comprise a signal sequence during export to the periplasm (15Roberts S.A.

Immunoblotting—To detect CueO, strains expressing CueO-derivatives were grown in Luria Bertani broth at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.5. The inducer anhydrotetracycline (200 μg/l) was added and CueO-expression was carried out for 3 h at 30° C. Cells were harvested, aliquots separated on SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. CueO-derivatives were detected by their Strep-TagII-epitopes with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, as described previously (13Lee S.M. Grass G. Rensing C. Barrett S.R. Yates C.J.D. Stoyanov J.V. Brown N.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Functional Assays—The model substrate 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) 1The abbreviations used are: DMP, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. (Aldrich) was used to assess catalytic activity by monitoring the change in absorption at 468 nm in the presence of CueO, as described previously (9Grass G. Rensing C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 902-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). CueO activity was also measured as oxygen uptake in presence of external CuCl2 using DMP as an artificial electron donor. The change in oxygen concentration was monitored by an oxygraph instrument (Hansatech, Cambridge UK), as described previously (32Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH adjusted with glacial acetic acid to specified values), 2 mm DMP, variable concentrations of CuCl2, and 250 μm O2 (estimated from Table values) at room temperature. Purified CueO protein was added to reach a concentration in the range of 25–100 μg/ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of CuCl2 (iron content < 0.005%; Mallinckrodt AR) and the initial rates were determined. Kinetic values for V max and K m were estimated using Lineweaver-Burk analyses and varying copper concentration between 0.14 and 20 mm. Water was millipore-purified and solutions were freshly prepared before each experiment. Mass Spectroscopy—Mass spectral analyses were performed on a Thermoquest LCQ and a Bruker Reflex III MALDI-TOF instrument. Samples measured by MALDI-TOF were mixed with a saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70:30 H2O/acetonitrile containing 0.1% of TFA, in such a way that the total amount of protein deposited was 1–2 pmol. In general, a laser attenuation of 80% was used. Electrospray ionization experiments were performed by direct injection of a ∼10 μm solution of the protein in MeOH/H2O, 1:1, containing 2% AcOH. All protein samples analyzed were in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, but diluted accordingly. Structural Studies. Location of Labile Copper—Optimal CueO activity occurs only in the presence of excess Cu(II) ions. To uncover the molecular basis for this, diffraction data were measured from crystals that had been soaked in CuCl2 and flash-frozen (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Diffraction data were measured from a frozen crystal using x-rays with λ = 1.378 Å to maximize anomalous scattering by the copper atoms. The anomalous difference Fourier electron density map, using phases calculated from a CueO model with copper atoms removed, displayed six strong peaks, five of which are shown in Fig. 1. Four of the strong peaks (28–30σ) coincide with the previously defined T1 and trinuclear copper positions, whereas a fifth strong site (18σ) is located near the T1 copper position and is consistent with a fully occupied copper atom, referred to below as the labile or regulatory copper. A weaker peak (11σ) is apparently the result of a partially occupied copper-binding site on the surface of the protein that is unlikely to be of functional importance. In the refined structure, the labile copper atom lies 7.5 Å from the T1 copper and is buried under the methionine-rich helix (Fig. 1). Coordination is through the SD atoms of Met-355 (2.2 Å) and Met-441 (2.5 Å), the OD1 atoms of Asp-360 (2.4 Å) and Asp-439 (2.1 Å), and a water molecule, HOH 2301 (3.1 Å), in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry (Fig. 2). Met-355 and HOH 2301 occupy axial positions, and Met-441, Asp-360, and Asp-439 are equatorial ligands. Interestingly, the labile copper and the T1 copper are directly linked through a hydrogen-bond from OD2 of Asp-439 to NE2 of His-443. As noted above, these two residues ligate the labile and T1 copper atoms, respectively, and the hydrogen-bond between them may provide a pathway for electron transfer between the two copper atoms. The largest structural change is for the side chain of Asp-439 with the ligating atom OD1 moving 2 Å, and CB moving 1.75 Å. The overall temperature factors for the labile copper and coordinating residues are somewhat higher than those for the other copper centers, averaging about 33 Å2 versus 22 Å2 for the entire protein (25 Å2 for side chain atoms), but the positions for these atoms are clearly defined in the final electron density maps. In addition, there is no residual electron density in the former position of the Asp-439 side chain. Protein Conformation—There are no significant structural changes in the protein upon copper binding. The coordinating side chains reorient to accommodate copper ligation, which is associated with small shifts in nearby backbone positions. The overall root-mean-square deviation in Cα atom positions between the structures with and without added copper is 0.18 Å; the largest shift (0.84 Å) was for the ligating residue Asp-439. It is possible that crystal lattice contacts could mask larger changes in this region upon binding copper, given that the structure was obtained via soaking of existing crystals with CuCl2; however, this seems unlikely because of the sparse number of contacts in the region. Furthermore, the crystals have oxidase activity. As noted, the labile copper ion is buried under the methionine-rich helix (residues 356–371), which, as in the absence of the labile copper, contains several non-copper-ligating methionine residues with poorly ordered side chains. The disorder is particularly evident in the methionine SD and CE atoms, where very large temperature factors are displayed. Amino acids 380–402 are not visible in the present electron density maps, as was also true in the absence of the labile copper. We have confirmed, by MALDI mass spectroscopic analysis of the frozen, copper-soaked crystals as prepared for data collection, that the protein is intact and not cleaved in this region. Possibly, the 22 unobserved amino acids become ordered in the presence of substrate or are involved in as-yet-unknown protein-protein interactions. A sixth partially occupied copper atom is found on the surface of the protein away from the active site region (15 Å from the T2 copper) and bound to His-488, Asp-132, and HOH 2001. Trinuclear Copper Cluster—In the initial report of the crystal structure of CueO, we noted an unusual trinuclear center geometry containing a linear copper-oxygen-copper geometry (15Roberts S.A. Weichsel A. Grass G. Thakali K. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Rensing C. Montfort W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2766-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The copper atoms of the trinuclear center lie in nearly identical positions in the previous and present structures; however, in the present structure, modeling of the bridging atom as a single oxygen resulted in a low temperature factor (3 Å2) and a 5σ residual electron density peak, indicating the need for more electrons at this site. The density is clearly spherical, and modeling as dioxygen, as was done in the structure of laccase from Melanocarpus albomyces (19Hakulinen N. Kiiskinen L.-L. Kruus K. Saloheimo M. Paananen A. Loivula A. Rouvinen J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 601-605PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in an unsatisfactory refinement. Modeling the atom as chlorine (10 mm CuCl2 was added to the crystal), refined well, yielding copper-to-chlorine distances of 2.3 and 2.5 Å (unrestrained), similar temperature factors for copper and chlorine atoms (∼20 Å2), and no residual electron density. The modeled geometry is appropriate for a copper-chlorine-copper moiety. Furthermore, this chlorine is 3 Å from the T2 copper and completes a square planar coordination sphere for that copper ion. We have reinvestigated the identity of the bridging atom in the original structure and both oxygen and chlorine refine satisfactorily in this position with acceptable temperature factors; the oxygen temperature factor was somewhat, but not dramatically, low (14 Å2), and the chlorine temperature factor was high (30 Å2) compared with the average of the copper atoms of the trinuclear cluster (14, 22, and 30 Å2). Because the geometry of the trinuclear cluster we observed is that expected for a bridging chloride ion, we now believe that the structure previously reported contains a bridging chlorine atom in the trinuclear cluster. Mutagenesis and CueO Activity—To investigate whether the labile copper atom contributes to CueO activity, four mutants were constructed (M355L, D360A, D439A, and M441L), each of which has one ligand removed from the copper coordination sphere. The UV-visible absorption spectra are the same for the wild-type protein and the M355L, D360A, and D439A proteins, confirming that these mutations have not affected copper incorporation into the nearby T1 copper site. However, for the M441L protein, the absorbance at 610 nm, relative to that at 280 nm, shows about 50% less intensity, suggesting that the mutation has affected copper incorporation into the T1 copper site. X-ray diffraction data for the M441L mutant protein has been measured and the structure analyzed. The M441L polypeptide is identical with that of the wild-type protein (Protein Data Bank code 1KV7) except for the replacement of the side chain at the mutation site. However, a large negative peak (–10σ) appears centered at the T1 copper site. Setting the occupancy of the T1 copper to one half results in the disappearance of this negative peak, indicating that the T1 copper is about half depleted, in agreement with the spectroscopic results. None of the mutant CueO proteins were as effective as wild-type CueO in protecting cells against copper-induced cell death; two of them, M355L and D360A, are completely inactive (Fig. 3). Oxidase activity of the purified mutant proteins is also decreased by the mutations (Table II). Under the conditions used (pH 6.8, 200 mm Tris-acetate buffer), all mutant CueO proteins show significantly lower oxidase activity; one, M355L, shows essentially no activity. Thus, disruption of the labile copper-binding site has led to a reduced copper oxidase specific activity in vitro and loss of the copper tolerance phenotype in vivo. D439A is the most active of the four mutant proteins, in agreement with the results of the copper tolerance experiments.Table IIKinetic parameters for the reaction of CueO with DMP at pH 6.5ProteinVmaxKm Cu2+μmolO2/mg protein/minmmWild type3.1 ± 0.150.163 ± 0.03D360A0.87 ± 0.081.6 ± 0.08D439A1.03 ± 0.090.59 ± 0.03M355LaThe kinetic values did not vary appreciably as a function of protein concentration, except for M355L, in which the low activity introduced greater uncertainty, and estimates of Km varied between 73 and 90 mm.

Open table in a new tab To assess whether the mutations led to proteins with altered stability, we examined oxidase activity after incubating at elevated temperatures. Wild-type CueO and the four mutant proteins were subjected to 10-min incubations, ±2 mm CuCl2, at 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 °C, followed by measurement of their activities at 25 °C. Wild-type CueO is reasonably thermostabile, displaying 67% of its activity after 70 °C incubation in the absence of added copper and 91% in the presence of excess copper. Thus, binding of the labile copper has a small stabilizing affect on the protein. Mutants M355L, M441L, and D439A retained 93, 60, and 63% of their original activity, respectively, after incubation at 70 °C in the presence of excess copper, and t"
https://openalex.org/W2114491796,"Detoxification of hydroperoxides in trypanosomes is mediated by a series of linked redox pathways that are dependent on the parasite-specific thiol trypanothione for reducing equivalents. These pathways are characterized by differences in subcellular location, electron transport molecules, and substrate specificity. To determine the functional significance of the enzymes involved, we have used a tetracycline-inducible RNA interference system to down-regulate expression of each of the corresponding transcripts in bloodstream form <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>. We have identified two peroxidases, a cytosolic peroxiredoxin (TbCPX) and a member of the non-selenium glutathione-dependent peroxidase family (TbGPXI), that appear to be essential for the viability of this clinically relevant stage of the parasite life cycle. The addition of tetracycline to the cultures resulted in a major reduction in mRNA levels and enzyme activity, a dramatic fall in growth rate, and significant cell death. Furthermore, within 20 h of adding tetracycline, cells in which the cytosolic peroxiredoxin transcript was targeted were found to be 16-fold more susceptible to killing by exogenous hydrogen peroxide. We also observed that knockdown of the tryparedoxin TbT-PNI, a thioredoxin-like protein that facilitates electron transport to both TbCPX and TbGPXI, resulted in a reduction in growth rate. These experiments therefore identify redox pathways that are essential for oxidative defense in <i>T. brucei</i> and validate the corresponding peroxidases as targets for drug design."

A growing number of mammalian DNA polymerases have been identified within recent years, and initial characterization suggests that they have specialized roles in DNA replication or repair. Based on sequence relationships, the enzymes are currently classified into four families designated A, B, X, and Y (1Burgers P.M. Koonin E.V. Bruford E. Blanco L. Burtis K.C. Christman M.F. Copeland W.C. Friedberg E.C. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D.C. Lawrence C.W. Nakanishi M. Ohmori H. Prakash L. Prakash S. Reynaud C.A. Sugino A. Todo T. Wang Z. Weill J.C. Woodgate R. J. Biol.

Founder members of each family are Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (pol) 1The abbreviations used are: pol, DNA polymerase; ICL, interstrand crosslink; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EST, expressed sequence tag. I (family A), mammalian pol α (family B), mammalian pol β (family X), and E. coli pol V (family Y). Nuclear enzymes in families B, X, and Y have received much recent attention, with family Y including enzymes that can bypass DNA template lesions. In Drosophila melanogaster, a family A enzyme is believed to be encoded by the Mus308 gene (2Harris P.V. Mazina O.M. Leonhardt E.A. Case R.B. Boyd J.B. Burtis K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal portion of Mus308 is predicted to encode a DNA polymerase, whereas the NH2-terminal portion predicts seven characteristic motifs found in DNA and RNA helicases. An apparent human ortholog of Mus308, designated POLQ or DNA pol θ, is encoded in the human genome (NCBI accession number NM_006596), and a cDNA representing the COOH-terminal part of the gene has been isolated (3Sharief F.S. Vojta P.J. Ropp P.A. Copeland W.C. Genomics. 1999; 59: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We recently isolated a mammalian DNA helicase gene designated HEL308, which is homologous to the NH2-terminal portion of Drosophila Mus308 (4Marini F. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8716-8723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Mus308 gene lead to marked sensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents (5Boyd J.B. Sakaguchi K. Harris P.V. Genetics. 1990; 125: 813-819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs) can be caused by some environmental and chemotherapeutic agents and are potent inhibitors of DNA replication and transcription. In mammalian systems, ICL repair takes place and can be observed in cells, but the mechanisms are not well understood. In E. coli, ICLs can be repaired by the coordinated action of nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination (6Cole R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 7Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this pathway, the prototype A family enzyme pol I plays a crucial role. With the aim of discovering enzymes related to Mus308 and pol I that may be involved in DNA crosslink repair, we sought mammalian DNA polymerases belonging to the A family of DNA polymerases and identified a new mammalian DNA polymerase, POLN (DNA pol ν). Isolation of Human and Mouse POLN Genes—Searches of public data bases revealed a mouse expressed sequence tag, AA475002 (NCBI accession number) homologous to the COOH-terminal part of the Drosophila mus308 polymerase domain. From this 1193-bp sequence, primers were designed to clone the murine coding sequence by 3′- and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (BD Biosciences SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit). Total RNA was prepared from mouse leukemia L1210 cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Two different amplification reactions were performed to exclude mistakes obtained by PCR amplification, and verified fragments were assembled. For the human cDNA, primers were designed from NCBI sequence AF044578 to isolate a 1756-bp COOH-terminal fragment by PCR from a testis cDNA library (BD Biosciences). To obtain and analyze the NH2-terminal region of human POLN, total RNA was extracted from K562 cells and 833K cells. Reverse transcription and nested PCR was performed and the products cloned using a Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Inserts were screened by PCR using vector primers M13F and M13R. Insert sizes varied because of alternative splicing and several clones from each set were sequenced. Cell Growth and Expression of GFP-POLN—SV40-transformed human MRC5VA fibroblasts were grown in minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The POLN open reading frame was amplified using Pfu DNA polymerase and primers containing terminal EcoRI and BamHI sites. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into the EcoRI, BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences). This produced an in-frame fusion of POLN to the COOH terminus of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). A QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used for introducing substitution mutations. Constructs and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 48 h, cells were incubated in selection medium containing 800 μg/ml G418. Stable transfectants were isolated after 2 weeks selection. To visualize GFP-tagged POLN, cells grown on coverslips were rinsed in PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were mounted with Glycergel (Dako) and photographed with an Olympus Fluoview BX61 confocal microscope and a CCD camera. DNA Polymerase Assays—Exponentially growing MRC5VA cells were transfected with either GFP or GFP-POLN and 24 h later were washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells (2 × 107 per assay point) were lysed in 500 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min on ice. Each cleared lysate (22,000 × g for 20 min) was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h with 5 μg of mouse monoclonal 3E6 anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes) that had been cross-linked to 35 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates on a Micro Bio-Spin column (Bio-Rad) were washed three times with 1 ml lysis buffer and one time with 1 ml of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Rabbit polyclonal antibody PA434, raised against an NH2-terminal 500-amino acid fragment of human POLN produced in E. coli, was used for immunoblotting to detect the presence of various constructs of GFP-POLN. For reactions with activated calf thymus DNA (8Rush J. Konigsberg W.H. Prep. Biochem. 1989; 19: 329-340PubMed Google Scholar), 10 μl of protein-bound beads was incubated with 20 μl of buffer B, supplemented with 0.1 mm dATP, 0.1 mm dTTP, 0.1 mm dGTP, and 0.02 mm dCTP, 2 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and 25 μg of activated calf thymus DNA (Sigma), at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with 10 μl of 40 mm EDTA, 2% sodium pyrophosphate and placed on ice. As a positive control 0.5 unit of exo-free DNA pol I was used. 5 μl of each reaction mixture was spotted onto DE81 paper (Whatman), which was washed three times with 0.5 m Na2HPO4 for 5 min and once with ethanol. The paper was dried at room temperature and radioactivity quantified with the use of a Fuji phosphorimager. For primer extension, a 16-mer (5′-CTT GAA AAC ATA GCG A-3′) was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to a 34-mer template (5′-AGC GTC TTA ATC TAA GCT ATC GCT ATG TTT TCA AG-3′) (9Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) in buffer B with 0.1 mm of each dNTP were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μl of immunoprecipitated beads or 0.1 unit of pol I (exo-) as indicated. Reactions were terminated with 95% formamide and 2 mm EDTA and resolved in a 20% polyacrylamide gel. Northern Hybridization—Human and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots and human cancer cell line Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech) were hybridized according to the manufacturer's procedures. 100 ng of DNA probe, labeled with the Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads kit (Amersham Biosciences), was used in each case. Labeled probes were purified with Sephadex G-25 quick spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For mouse PolN, an 1193-bp cDNA fragment derived by PCR from EST AA475002 containing motifs 3–6 of the DNA polymerase domain was used as probe. For mouse Hel308, a 507-bp cDNA fragment containing motif VI of the helicase domain was used. The fragment was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit, Clontech), subcloned into pT-AdV (Clontech), and sequenced. EcoRI sites in the multiple cloning sites of the vector were used to obtain the fragment used for hybridization. Primers used for the RACE reaction were designed from EST AA517170. For human POLN the 1756-bp COOH-terminal cDNA fragment described above was subcloned into pT-AdV and sequenced. EcoRI sites in the multiple cloning site of the vector were used to release the fragment used for hybridization. For human HEL308 a 580-bp fragment derived by PCR amplification from EST AA625285 and containing motif VI of the helicase domain was used. The 2.0-kb human β-actin control probe (BD Biosciences) strongly hybridizes with mouse and rat actin mRNA and was used for all blots tested. In Situ Hybridization—A 930-bp fragment, including polymerase motifs 3–6 of mouse PolN from EST AA475002, was subcloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pGEM-3Z. A 631-bp fragment, including helicase motif VI of mouse Hel308 from EST AA517170, was subcloned into the XmaI and XbaI sites of pGEM-3Z. 35S-Labeled antisense riboprobes were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase for both PolN and Hel308 (35S at ∼800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Methods for probe synthesis, mouse tissue preparation, pretreatment, hybridization, washing, and coating of slides for autoradiography were essentially as described in Ref. 10Senior P.V. Critchley D.R. Beck F. Walker R.A. Varley J.M. Development (Camb.). 1988; 104: 431-446PubMed Google Scholar. Post-hybridization washes included an RNase A step to degrade imperfectly hybridized regions, followed by washes to reach a stringency of 0.5 × SSC at 65 °C. Autoradiography was for 18 days, after which sections were developed and Giemsa-stained. Slides were examined using an Olympus BH2 microscope under conventional (bright field) and epi-illumination (dark field) conditions that reveal autoradiographic silver grains as bright particles. As a control to show the presence of hybridizable mRNA, sections of all blocks were hybridized separately with a probe for β-actin mRNA, generated with SP6 RNA polymerase on DraI-linearized plasmid (11Zandvliet D.W.

Isolation of a Novel A-family DNA Polymerase Gene from Mammalian Genomes—Searching for mammalian homologs of E. coli DNA pol I, we found a mouse expressed sequence tag clone (AA475002) and a human sequence (AF044578) related to pol I but unlinked to POLQ. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to obtain longer mouse and human cDNA fragments and complete sequence information (Fig. 1). Because of the strong DNA polymerase similarity and activity described below, the gene was designated as POLN (symbol, pol ν), with agreement from the HUGO nomenclature committee. Both the mouse and human genes span unusually long regions of the genomes and have consequently escaped accurate computational annotation. The human genomic region comprises 24 exons that inhabit 160 kb of genomic DNA, with the longest two introns measuring 26 and 32 kb. The COOH-terminal part of the human gene encoded by exons 14–24 was confirmed by repeated isolation of the same sequence, whereas the NH2-terminal part of the gene had numerous alternatively spliced forms. Of 20 human cDNA clones derived from RNA of cell lines K562 and 833K and sequenced, 14 represented various alternative splices that would produce an inactive protein by exon skipping or inclusion of alternative exons (see Supplemental Material for details). Six of 20 clones (the most frequent class) were for a human cDNA with the sequence in Fig. 1, encoding a protein of 900 amino acids. There was also evidence of alternative splicing in the mouse sequence. Full sequencing of two murine reverse transcriptase-PCR clones lacked one exon encoding residues 539–556. The predicted mouse cDNA encodes a protein of 866 residues (the nucleotide sequences reported in this paper have been submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with accession numbers AY136549 and AY135562) (Fig. 1). The proteins predicted by the human and mouse cDNAs are 70% identical and 75% similar over their entire lengths. In the human cDNA, the ATG encoding the first Met residue lies within a sequence compatible with the Kozak consensus for start of translation, with a G at position +4 and an A at position –3. In the mouse cDNA, Met residue 3 (Fig. 1A) is in a sequence context that matches the Kozak consensus better in the two critical positions +4 and –3 than does Met residue 1. The site of transcript polyadenylation in the human sequence was found by cDNA sequencing and occurred 151 nucleotides 3′ of the termination codon, preceded by a likely polyadenylation signal sequence (AGUAAA). The COOH-terminal half of mammalian POLN, beginning at residue 419 of the human protein, is highly related to PolA family enzymes from bacteria and bacteriophage, as well as to the predicted DNA polymerase domains of D. melanogaster Mus308 and human POLQ. Within this pol similarity region, human POLN and E. coli pol I have 33% identity (48% similarity), while human POLN and POLQ have 29% identity (43% similarity) within the equivalent region (see Supplemental Material for details). Motifs found to be conserved throughout the procaryotic PolA family (12Patel P.H. Suzuki M. Adman E. Shinkai A. Loeb L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 823-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) are also found in POLN as indicated in Fig. 1. With reference to the fingers-thumb-palm structural nomenclature for family A polymerases, the POLN proteins contain well conserved features. These include Motif 1 (at the top of the thumb subdomain), Motif 2a (on one of the thumb helices), Motif 2b (contributing to palm and thumb subdomain contacts with DNA), Motif 3 (also called Motif A), which forms a pocket for the incoming dNTP, Motif 4 (also called Motif B), Motif 5 (also called Motif C), which coordinates a divalent cation, and Motif 6, which interacts with the first template base. From the cDNA cloning and sequencing results we concluded that the mammalian POLN cDNAs are expressed and have the potential to encode active DNA polymerases. There is no sequence indication of 3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′ nuclease domains and no significant similarity of residues preceding the pol domain (1–418) to other proteins in the public data base. Chromosomal Localization—Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed to identify the genomic location of mouse PolN and Hel308 genes. A genomic DNA cosmid library from mouse 129/Ola spleen cells (RessourcenZentrum Primaer-Datenbank) was probed with a 400-bp cDNA fragment derived from EST AA475002 by PCR, containing part of the PolN DNA polymerase domain. Sequencing of 4.3 kbp of a positive genomic clone revealed that it contained motif 3 of PolN. The cosmid was used to hybridize mouse metaphases and showed that PolN mapped to chromosome 5, region C1 (not shown). This region is syntenic to the human chromosome 4p16.2 region where POLN is located in the human genome. The related human POLQ gene is on chromosome 3q13. The same mouse cosmid library was screened with a 500-bp cDNA fragment containing helicase motif VI of Hel308, obtained from NCBI EST number AA517170. Three cosmids were confirmed to contained mouse Hel308 gene fragments and all mapped to chromosome 5, region E by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (not shown). This region of the mouse genome is syntenic to human chromosome 4q21 where human HEL308 is encoded. Human POLN Localizes to Nuclei—Analysis of POLN by the PSORT II program (psort.nibb.ac.jp/) predicts nuclear localization, with no mitochondrial signal sequence. Putative nuclear localization signals are present starting at residues 134 and 741 of human POLN (Fig. 1). To experimentally analyze the cellular localization of human POLN, the cDNA encoding the GFP protein was fused in-frame to the amino terminus of POLN (GFP-POLN), and transfected into SV40-transformed MRC5VA fibroblasts. After G418 selection, single clones were isolated. In all clones tested, the tagged protein was found only in cell nuclei, with exclusion from nucleoli. Control clones harboring a construct expressing only GFP showed diffuse distribution of fluorescence in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2). POLN Encodes a DNA Polymerase—To determine whether POLN had DNA polymerase activity as predicted from the sequence, human GFP-POLN was expressed in mammalian cells and immunopurified. As a negative control, a single point mutation was created to change an Asp codon (GAC) in the highly conserved polymerase motif 3 (Fig. 1) to an Ala codon (GCC). Substitution of the corresponding Asp abrogates polymerase activity in bacterial pol I (13Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This mutant (D624A) form of POLN was strongly predicted to be catalytically inactive. Recently, Shimazaki et al. (14Shimazaki N. Yoshida K. Kobayashi T. Toji S. Tamai K. Koiwai O. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 639-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) found that recombinant DNA polymerase λ (pol λ) contains a proline-rich region. Deletion of this region increased pol λ activity by 3–18-fold. The COOH-terminal 35 amino acids of human POLN include 11 proline residues, not present in the mouse PolN sequence (Fig. 1). To test for an effect of the proline-rich domain on activity, a point mutation was introduced to eliminate the last 39 residues of human POLN by changing Trp codon 861 (TGG) to a stop codon (TGA). POLN and the mutant forms were expressed as NH2-terminal GFP tagged proteins by transfection of the human fibroblast cell line MRC5VA. Expression and nuclear localization of the normal and mutant GFP fusion proteins was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy (not shown). From total cell extracts of the transiently transfected MRC5VA cells, tagged POLN was immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads. POLN and mutant forms were recovered in similar amounts in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A, IPP lanes). Human POLN had DNA polymerase activity as assayed with activated calf thymus DNA as substrate (Fig. 3B). The D624A mutant protein showed no detectable activity above background. POLN was also able to extend DNA on a singly primed template (Fig. 3C). A ladder of products was observed, with the predominant product being extension of the primer by 18 nucleotides to the end of the template. The D624A mutant protein (Fig. 3C, D>A) showed no DNA polymerase activity on the singly primed template in comparison with immunoprecipitations from non-transfected cells or cells containing GFP alone. Deletion of the proline-rich COOH-terminal tail from POLN did not measurably change DNA polymerase activity (Fig. 3, B and C, ΔP constructs). Expression of POLN and HEL308 in Mammalian Cells— Northern hybridization was used to begin an investigation of the expression pattern of POLN in human and mouse cells. Whether expression of POLN and HEL308 overlaps is a point of interest, because each is homologous to portions of POLQ. For this reason, hybridization was done in parallel to investigate HEL308 expression. Northern hybridization of a human tissue Poly(A)+ RNA blot was performed with a probe complementary to the COOH-terminal 1700 nucleotides of human POLN. A full-length POLN transcript is predicted to be a minimum of 3.3 kb long, based on the coding sequence plus 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. A POLN transcript of about 4 kb was detected in testis tissue (Fig. 4A). A shorter transcript of about 2 kb was also present in most tissues, and was the predominant form detected in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. This presumably reflects a frequent alternative splice event. Longer transcripts were also apparent in skeletal muscle and heart (Fig. 4A). Overall, expression of POLN was relatively weak and required long exposure times to detect hybridization in human tissues. A full-length HEL308 transcript is predicted to be about 3 kb long. Northern hybridization detected a single transcript of this size in many tissues (Fig. 4A). Expression was strongest in testis and next highest in heart, skeletal muscle, and ovary. A panel of human cancer cell lines was also surveyed by northern hybridization using the same probes (Fig. 4B). All lines examined contained the predominant POLN 2-kb transcript, with the longer, full-length transcript apparent only in the K562 cell line, originating from a chronic myelogenous leukemia. HEL308 transcripts were detected in all cell lines tested, although at varying levels. Northern hybridization of RNA from mouse tissues detected expression of PolN only in testis tissue, with a transcript size of about 4 kb (Fig. 4C). A Hel308 transcript of 3–4 kb was apparent in mouse liver and kidney tissue as well as testis. Because of the predominance of expression of POLN and HEL308 in testis tissue, in situ hybridization was used to more closely examine the production of PolN and Hel308 transcripts in the mouse. Expression of PolN and Hel308 in Testis—Thirty sections from different mouse organs were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Convincing evidence of expression of both Hel308 and PolN was seen by this technique only in seminiferous tubules of the adult testis (Fig. 5). In mammals, the seminiferous epithelium presents germ cells at different stages of development with specific cell types integrated in concentric layers (15Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. SinhaHikin A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990Google Scholar, 16Oakberg E.F. Am. J. Anat. 1956; 99: 391-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Dark field conditions (Fig. 5, B, D, and F) reveal autoradiographic silver grains as bright particles. These show that, while β-actin is expressed in all cell types (Fig. 5F), PolN and Hel308 are expressed only in a subset of cells within the adult testis. PolN expression appeared maximal in meiotic spermatocytes and in post-meiotic round spermatids (Fig. 5, A and B, and data not shown). There appeared to be a graded reduction in labeling across the spermatid layers. Expression was seen neither in elongated spermatids nor in the mature spermatozoa. Labeling was low or absent in the B type spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. There was no expression in interstitial cells including Leydig cells. In situ analysis for Hel308 showed weaker hybridization (Fig. 5, C and D), with maximal signal from primary spermatocytes, but not round spermatids. Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and other cell types within the testis were not labeled. A Distinct Mus308/POLN Subfamily in Higher Eukaryotes— POLN and the related enzyme POLQ are found in eukaryotic cells, but are not detected in yeast or other fungi. A multiple sequence alignment was performed with 42 PolA family sequences representing a wide variety of bacterial pol I enzymes, bacteriophage DNA polymerases, DNA pol γ enzymes from fungi and higher eukaryotes, and enzymes similar to POLN and POLQ. A tree view of such a sequence alignment reveals relationships between the DNA polymerase region of POLN and that of other family A DNA polymerases (Fig. 6). Bacterial Family A DNA polymerases similar to E. coli pol I comprise one branch. A separate, more distantly related branch is composed of the mitochondrial DNA pol γ enzymes. DNA polymerases from many bacteriophage diverge more widely. The POLN and POLQ enzymes cluster in a distinct branch to form a separate subfamily (Fig. 6). Among nuclear DNA polymerases, POLN is the 14th currently proposed to have activity, the others being pols α, β, δ, ϵ, ζ, η, θ, ι, κ, λ, μ, Rev1, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Maga et al. (17Maga G. Shevelev I. Ramadan K. Spadari S. Hubscher U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) detected DNA polymerase activity for a purified 100-kDa protein postulated to be a fragment of human POLQ, but definitive identification as such and proof that full-length POLQ is an active nuclear DNA polymerase have yet to be demonstrated. Similarly, the Drosophila Mus308 gene has been recognized for some time, but clear evidence of the activity of its gene product has not been presented. Lesions that link together the two strands of DNA are among the most toxic forms of DNA damage, and their repair is a challenging problem. Such interstrand cross-links are potent inhibitors of DNA replication and transcription and can induce mutations and DNA rearrangements. Cells are exposed to environmental agents that cause ICLs, such as furocoumarins, and agents that form ICLs are widely used in cancer chemotherapy and phototherapy. In E. coli and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination are involved in interstrand cross-link repair (18Jachymczyk W.J. von Borstel R.C. Mowat M.R. Hastings P.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To complete repair, E. coli uses DNA polymerase I and the UvrD DNA helicase (19Sladek F.M. Munn M.M. Rupp W.D. Howard-Flanders P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6755-6765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Van Houten B. Gamper H. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6553-6560Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In mammalian cells comparable processes may also operate (21Thompson L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Hoy C. Thompson L. Mooney C. Salazar E. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 1737-1743PubMed Google Scholar, 23Howlett N.G. Taniguchi T. Olson S.

Eukaryotes also appear to have additional pathways of cross-link repair which use DNA polymerases that can bypass lesions (24De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 25Grossmann K.F. Ward A.M. Matkovic M.E. Folias A.E. Moses R.E. Mutat.

Biol. 2003; 23: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mammalian POLQ is predicted to encode both a DNA helicase and a DNA polymerase. Because HEL308 and POLN are, respectively, most similar to the helicase and polymerase domains of POLQ, it is possible that POLN and HEL308 are related to POLQ by an ancient gene duplication event. The close similarity between mouse and human POLN, and between mouse and human POLQ (Fig. 6), suggest that continued selection for distinct functions of the two enzymes has operated during mammalian evolution. It is possible that POLN and HEL308 may work together in the cell. Our investigation of the expression pattern of POLN and HEL308 showed a partial overlap, consistent with this possibility. We looked for co-immunoprecipitation of additional human proteins in cells expressing GFP-POLN by mass spectrometric analysis of proteins after two-dimensional electrophoresis. Although several heat-shock proteins were co-immunoprecipitated, HEL308 was not found. 2F. Marini, J. Minden, and R. D. Wood, unpublished data. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen, often associated with DNA polymerases as a cofactor, was also absent from the GFP-POLN immunoprecipitate. The precise function of POLN in the cell is yet unknown, a situation that is also presently true for most nuclear DNA polymerases. A possible function of the POLN/POLQ polymerase subfamily in DNA repair function was suggested recently by Shima et al. (27Shima N. Hartford S.A. Duffy T. Wilson L.A. Schimenti K.J. Schimenti J.C. Genetics. 2003; 163: 1031-1040PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse PolQ was proposed as a candidate for a gene that leads to spontaneous chromosome instability as measured by formation of micronuclei in reticulocytes. It is also intriguing that chromosome 4p16.2, where human POLN is located, is found to be deleted in about 50% of breast carcinomas (28Shivapurkar N. Sood S. Wistuba II Virmani A.K. Maitra A. Milchgrub S. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3576-3580PubMed Google Scholar). Considering its high expression in human and mouse testis tissue, another potential role for POLN is in meiosis. Previous studies have found that the mouse Polk, Poll, and Poli genes, respectively, encoding the specialized DNA polymerases dinB (pol κ), pol λ, and pol ι, are also highly expressed in the seminiferous tubules of the mouse testis (29Velasco-Miguel S. Richardson J.A. Gerlach V.L. Lai W.C. Gao T. Russell L.D. Hladik C.L. White C.L. Friedberg E.C. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30McDonald J.P.

Faili A. Bertocci B. Storck S. Delbos F. Cocea L. Gupta N. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3684-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the expression patterns of mRNA of the four polymerases in testis is somewhat different. While PolN and DinB are expressed in meiotic spermatocytes and in post-meiotic round spermatids, Poli is expressed in earlier stages of spermatogenesis. The expression pattern of Poll in seminiferous tubules is uniform. A high level of expression in testis does not necessarily restrict PolN or other DNA polymerases to a specialized role in this tissue. For example, POLI is thought to participate in somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes during B lymphocyte development (32Faili A. Aoufouchi S. Flatter E. Gueranger Q. Reynaud C.A. Weill J.C. Nature. 2002; 419: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). With respect to POLN, we found cDNAs expressed in human (K562) and mouse (L1210) cell lines, of hematopoeitic origin, implying that POLN may have roles in tissues other than testis. Gathering of more information on the biochemical characteristics of POLN may be expected to provide clues regarding its cellular functions.

Application of 20-HETE rapidly induced an inward, non-selective current in whole-cell recordings, which was inhibited by N-methyl-d-glucamine, 1.8 mm Ca2+, and 100 μm Gd3+ but remained unaffected by flufenamate and indomethacin. The current-voltage relationship obtained at low concentrations of 20-HETE (1–10 μm) demonstrated slight inward rectification, whereas the highest concentration of 20-HETE tested (30 μm) showed outward rectification, as shown previously for these channels using 100 μm 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol. Dose-response curves indicate that 20-HETE activated TRPC6 channels with an EC50 = 0.8 μm. Single channel analysis using inside-out patches revealed that 20-HETE increased open probability of mouse TRPC6 channels ∼3-fold, and this was in a membrane-delimited fashion. Interestingly, 20-HETE did not provoke changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Thus, we have identified an arachidonic acid metabolite, 20-HETE, as a novel activator for a TRP family member, TRPC6.

SOCs differ in their ionic selectivity, conductance, and sensitivity to inorganic and organic blockers. The best characterized SOC is the calcium release-activated calcium channel, a highly selective Ca2+ ion channel first described in mast cells (7Hoth M. Penner R.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Moreover, products of phospholipase A2, arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites, and DAG lipase can also activate calcium-permeable channels (23Peppelenbosch M.P.

Zeldin D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1-H10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This bioactive eicosanoid compound is produced in various tissues, including, kidney (27Roman R.J. Alonso-Galicia M.

Physiol. 2001; 280: H1-H10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Benoit C. Renaudon B. Salvail D. Rousseau E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L965-L973PubMed Google Scholar, 31Frisbee J.C. Roman R.J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Lombard J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1066-H1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mode of action of 20-HETE has yet to be established. It has been suggested that this compound represents an electropharmacological modulator capable of constricting various vascular and airway smooth muscle tissues by causing membrane depolarization and contraction (31Frisbee J.C. Roman R.J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Lombard J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1066-H1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zeldin D.C. Plitman J.D. Kobayashi J. Miller R.F. Snapper J.R. Falck J.R. Szarek J.L. Philpot R.M. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since several recent studies have determined that vascular smooth muscle cells express TRPC6 channels (33Walker R.L. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1184-C1192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Jung S. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the present study was aimed at assessing the electrophysiological effects of 20-HETE on mTRPC6 channels in an overexpression system. The rationale was to test whether 20-HETE might activate a specific isoform of TRPC conductances in an attempt to explain its well characterized inotropic effects, which are not directly related to the activation of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-sensitive Ca2+ channels but rather to changes in non-selective membrane conductances (34Jung S. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 35Welsh D.G. Morielli A.D. Nelson M.T. Brayden J.E. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Our results conclusively demonstrate that application of 20-HETE activates mTRPC6 channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells and in smooth muscle cells. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). HEK-t6.11 stable clones were obtained as described previously (36Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and were cultured in the same medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Smooth Muscle Cell Culture—Male or female albino guinea pigs (Hartley, weighing 350–450 g) were anesthetized by a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and sacrificed by abdominal exsanguinations. The trachea was excised aseptically and placed immediately on ice into sterile Krebs solution. The trachea was cut free of excess tissue and cut longitudinally on the opposite side of the smooth muscle. The epithelial cells were mechanically removed with a sterile cotton swab. The smooth muscle tissue was minced, washed in minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 200 μm free Ca2+, and centrifuged at 80 × g for 1 min. The pellet was resuspended and dissociated in 200 μm Ca2+ MEM with 640 units/ml collagenase (type IV), 10 units/ml elastase (type IV), and 20 μg/ml DNase (type I), all from Sigma. The tissue was digested at 37 °C for 3 × 20 min. The cell suspension was then filtered through 100-μm nylon cell strainer, and the filtrate was washed with 900 μm Ca2+ MEM. The cells were centrifuged for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Opti-MEM supplemented by 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were plated in 35 mm-dishes with ∼103 cells for each dish, and after 30 min incubation at 37 °C, the dishes were completed with 2 ml of Opti-MEM. Cells were used for electrophysiology experiments within 48 h. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell currents in HEK293 and HEK-t6.11 cells were measured with the patch clamp technique (37Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar) performed at room temperature using fire-polished patch pipettes (3–6 megaohms of uncompensated series resistance). Currents were recorded with an Axo-Patch amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), controlled by homemade software. The standard holding potential was –40 mV, and membrane currents were filtered at 500 Hz and acquired at 1000 Hz. Single channel recordings were performed in the inside-out configuration with Sylgard-coated patch pipette. The membrane potential was set to –60 mV, and the signal was filtered at 1000 Hz and acquired at 2000 Hz. In whole-cell configuration, the standard intracellular solution contained: 140 mm CsAsp, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 18 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm ATP, and 0.03 mm GTP, pH 7.2. (calculated free internal Ca2+, 100 nm). The standard bath solution contained: 140 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 15 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. In inside-out configuration, a solution containing 120 mm CsCl, 5.87 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, was used in the pipette and bath. Substances were added by a local perfusion system (Perfusion Fast-Step, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) diluted to their final concentrations: 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3, 10, or 30 μm 20-HETE, 50 and 100 μm 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) (sonicated before use), 10 μm AA, 10 μm 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), 100 μm flufenamate (FFA), and 1 μm carbamylcholine. For experiments testing the effects of 100 μm Gd3+, a perfusion buffer lacking EGTA was used. In some experiments, Na+ was replaced with N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG). The effect of 100 μm indomethacin was tested by preincubating cells for 10 min prior to stimulation. All reagents were obtained from Sigma except: 20-HETE, AA, ETYA, and 14,15-eicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET) (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) and OAG (Calbiochem). Data Analysis—Analysis was performed with a homemade software written in Visual Basic. Channel activity is expressed as NP o, calculated for consecutive 5-s intervals. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Whole-cell experiments were performed on HEK-t6.11 cells stably expressing mTRPC6, as described previously (36Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Following whole-cell break-in, an inward current was observed with a mean amplitude of –43 ± 3.3 pA (n = 31) at a membrane potential of –40 mV. Application of 1 μm 20-HETE induced a rapid increase in current, as shown in Fig. 1A. This current remained activated in the continued presence of 20-HETE. When perfusion was switched to a 20-HETE-free solution, the level of current rapidly decreased back to control levels. No time- and dose-dependent desensitizations were observed. Fig. 1B illustrates the current to voltage relationship (I/V curve) of the 20-HETE-induced current. It is clearly evident that the 20-HETE-activated current displayed an I/V curve demonstrating a slight inward rectification. With Na+ and Cs+ as charge carriers, the reversal potential was found to be 3.4 ± 1.5 mV (n = 31), indicating a non-selective conductance. To confirm that the 20-HETE-induced current was specific to mTRPC6 overexpression, experiments were also performed in parallel on non-transfected cells. The mean basal current level, in the absence of stimuli, was not different (–41 ± 8 pA, n = 6) from that recorded for HEK-t6.11 cells, but the current amplitude was not increased by the application of 1 μm 20-HETE (Fig. 1C), and the I/V curves obtained in control and 20-HETE conditions were superimposable (Fig. 1D). The relationship between 20-HETE concentrations and current amplitude was then studied using the Hek-t6.11 cells. Current amplitudes induced by 20-HETE, at –40 mV, were measured as the difference between the current in the absence of stimuli and the current in the presence of the different concentrations of 20-HETE. The results presented in Fig. 1E show that the effects of 20-HETE are dose-dependent with an EC50 value of 0.8 μm. Fig. 2 (A and B) shows that for a concentration of 30 μm 20-HETE, not only was the amplitude of the 20-HETE-induced current larger than at other doses, but more surprisingly, the I/V relation was different. Indeed, the curve was doubly rectifying, similar to what has been described for OAG-activated TRPC6 (22Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). To compare the OAG- and 20-HETE-induced currents in HEKt-6.11 cells, we performed experiments using two different concentrations of OAG, a membrane-permeable analog of DAG. When 100 μm OAG was applied (Fig. 2C), the maximum amplitude of the induced current at –40 mV was –153 ± 42 pA (n = 5), and the I/V relation demonstrated double rectification (Fig. 2D). At a lower OAG concentration (50 μm; Fig. 2E; –19.7 ± 7 pA, n = 4 out of 9), the I/V relation was similar to that obtained for 20-HETE concentrations lower or equal to 10 μm, where both showed inward rectification (Fig. 2F). The reversal potential, using the same charge carriers, i.e. Na+ and Cs+, was found to be near 0 mV under all conditions: 100 μm OAG (mean = 2.8 ± 4.8 mV, n = 5), 50 μm OAG (mean = 2.1 ± 4.2, n = 4), 30 μm 20-HETE (mean = 0.9 ± 0.8, n = 7). Similar results were obtained by applying carbamylcholine (1 μm), which binds to endogenous muscarinic receptors and, through a Gq protein, induces the production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and DAG. The activated current was transient, and the I/V curve was similar (data not shown) to that recorded using high concentrations of OAG. No currents were triggered in wild-type HEK293 cells following application of either OAG or carbamylcholine (data not shown). Experiments were then performed in isolated patches in the inside-out configuration to determine whether 20-HETE could activate mTRPC6 in a membrane-delimited fashion as already shown for DAG analogs (22Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Application of 1 μm 20-HETE to the bath induced a marked increase of the channel activity (Fig. 3A, n = 7 out of 10). Fig. 3B shows the measured NP o over time, where N is the number of channels, and P o is the channel open probability. NP o increased ∼3-fold over control conditions. Similar results were obtained with 100 μm OAG but with a higher increase in channel activity (data not shown). To better characterize the 20-HETE-induced current, the ionic composition of the external medium was modified. Inward currents were abolished when Na+ was replaced by NMDG+ as the only external cation charge carrier (Fig. 4A). Note that the basal current was also blocked in these conditions. The I/V curves with Na+ or NMDG+ are illustrated in Fig. 4B and reveal that the reversal potential was shifted to –25.6 ± 0.5 mV (n = 6) with NMDG+ in the bath. The experiments performed above were conducted in a low Ca2+ perfusion medium, and as shown in Fig. 4, C and D, perfusion of a 20-HETE solution containing 1.8 mm Ca2+ decreased the amplitude of the current to basal levels, indicating that Ca2+ blocked only the 20-HETE-induced current (n = 4). In addition to Ca2+, several di- and trivalent cations can also block TRPC channels. Notably, Gd3+ has been used to block capacitative currents at a concentration of 1 μm, whereas 100 μm blocks non-capacitative currents. Fig. 5A illustrates that, following current activation by perfusing a solution containing 1 μm 20-HETE, the addition of 100 μm Gd3+ inhibited the 20-HETE-induced current (n = 4), whereas perfusion of 1 μm Gd3+ was ineffective (data not shown) The non-specific cation channel blocker FFA was shown to enhance currents mediated by TRPC6, whereas currents mediated by TRPC3 and TRPC7 were inhibited (38Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Contrary to this report, we found that the 20-HETE-triggered current in HEK-t6.11 cells was not sensitive to 100 μm FFA (n = 3, Fig. 5B). In human pulmonary arteries, the effects of 20-HETE are inhibited by preincubation with indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), indicating that a metabolite of 20-HETE could be the active compound (39Birks E.K. Bousamra M. Presberg K. Marsh J.A. Effros R.M. Jacobs E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L823-L829PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether this could be applied to our system. Fig. 5C demonstrates that preincubation of HEK-t6.11 cells with 1 μm indomethacin for 10 min did not affect the 20-HETE-induced current (n = 3). In A7r5 smooth muscle cells, it has been reported that AVP activated a non-capacitative Ca2+ entry directly regulated by arachidonic acid produced by the activities of PLC and DAG lipase (25Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Similarly, dTRPL channels are activated by DAG and DAG analogs and by polyunsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic, linoleic, and linolenic acids (19Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. (N. Y.). 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 40Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In HEK-t6.11cells, AA (10 μm) activated a current with properties similar to those of the 20-HETE-induced current (Fig. 6, A and B, n = 4). Application of a non-metabolizable AA analog, ETYA, at a concentration of 10 μm did not induce any currents (Fig. 6, C and D, n = 4). The concentration of ETYA used effectively blocks all pathways of AA metabolism including lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenase (COX), phospholipase A2, and cytochrome P-450, suggesting that the observed AA-induced currents are due to one of its metabolites. Our next aim was to determine whether 20-HETE could induce a similar effect in a cell type that expresses TRPC6 endogenously. We therefore tested primary cultures of tracheal smooth muscle cells obtained from guinea pig where endogenous expression of TRPC6 was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR (data not shown). In Fig. 7A, we show that 1 μm 20-HETE induced an inward current in these cells with an average amplitude of –42 ± 6 pA (n = 3). Interestingly, removal of 20-HETE did not result in reversal of the induced current. The current-voltage relationship (Fig. 7B), however, is similar to that obtained with 20-HETE in Hek-t6.11 cells. The data presented herein consistently and conclusively show that the eicosanoid compound, 20-HETE, activates mTRPC6 channels in Hek-t6.11 cells. TRPC6 channels belong to the subfamily TRPC3/TRPC6/TRPC7 (4Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which displays the unique characteristic of being activated by DAG or DAG-permeant analogs. Application of OAG (100 μm) activated a current demonstrating a characteristic doubly rectifying I/V curve in transfected cells (22Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar), as well as in rabbit portal vein cells (38Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and A7r5 smooth muscle cells (34Jung S. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which express these channels endogenously. Similar results were obtained in HEK-t6.11 cells when OAG and carbamylcholine (data not shown) were applied. The I/V curve of the 20-HETE-activated current showed a slight inward rectification for low concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μm with a reversal potential near 0 mV, indicating the activation of a non-selective cation channel. At 30 μm, the highest concentration used in our study, the I/V curve was similar to that obtained for 100 μm OAG. Moreover, substitution of Na+ with NMDG+ abolished the inward current and shifted the reversal potential toward more negative values, in agreement with data obtained for OAG-activated TRPC6 currents (22Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Other TRPC6-specific characteristics, such as blockage by 1.8 mm Ca2+ and 100 μm Gd3+, were also observed for the 20-HETE-activated current. FFA, a non-specific cation channel blocker, was shown to increase the current amplitude mediated by TRPC6 (34Jung S. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 38Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). However, we did not find that FFA had any effect on the 20-HETE-activated current. Several reports have shown that TRPC members can form oligomeric complexes with subunits from the same subfamily. The resulting heteromeric channels were shown to behave differently than homomeric channels formed with either subunit alone. We verified that the overexpression of mTRPC6 did not result in the formation of such heteromeric channels by coimmunoprecipitation studies (data not shown). Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of the various TRPC subunits were not different between HEK293T and Hek-t6.11 cells (data not shown). Previous reports have shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular AA, could induce non-capacitative currents in A7r5 smooth muscle cells and could activate the closely related dTRPL channels. In our model of overexpression, AA induced non-selective currents identical to those induced by 20-HETE. Moreover, lack of current activation when using a non-metabolizable form of AA (ETYA) supports the hypothesis that AA action appears to be mediated by a metabolite, most likely 20-HETE. Indeed, AA is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to produce EETs and 19- and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (19- and 20-HETE). It is now clear that these metabolites play a central role as second messengers in the regulation of renal vascular tone (27Roman R.J. Alonso-Galicia M. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 238-242PubMed Google Scholar). The cytochrome P-450 4A family (CYP4A) catalyzes the formation of 20-HETE, all isoforms of which are expressed in human kidney (41Roman R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 131-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that in HEK293 cells, AA could be metabolized into 20-HETE, and it would explain the similarity of the currents activated by AA and 20-HETE. We tested a second metabolite of AA, 14,15-EET, which is produced by cytochrome P-450 epoxygenases (30Benoit C. Renaudon B. Salvail D. Rousseau E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L965-L973PubMed Google Scholar, 41Roman R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 131-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). This metabolite has been reported to activate large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels and inhibit Cl– channels in vascular and airway smooth muscles (30Benoit C. Renaudon B. Salvail D. Rousseau E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L965-L973PubMed Google Scholar, 42Salvail D. Dumoulin M. Rousseau E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L432-L441PubMed Google Scholar). We found that 1 μm 14,15-EET isomer did not trigger currents in our cell model (data not shown). Despite the molecular similarities between 20-HETE and 14,15-EET (both are hydrophobic and structurally related), these two molecules induce distinct responses. The mode of action of DAG analogs or polyunsaturated fatty acids has not yet been established. Based on results obtained with a PLC blocker (U73122), it has been proposed that 1-stearyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, a membrane-permeant analog of DAG, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, when applied exogenously, stimulate PLC, which thus activates dTRPL channels indirectly (43Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that neither inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate nor phosphokinase C was able to activate TRPC6 (22Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Similar phosphokinase C-independent activation of TRPC3/6/7 has been reported (for a review, see Ref. 19Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. (N. Y.). 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This was further confirmed by the increase in channel activity in inside-out patches, outlining a direct effect on the channel. As we have found a similar effect for 20-HETE using isolated patches in an inside-out configuration, we can also conclude a direct effect of 20-HETE on mTRPC6. Activation of mTRPC6 was reported to induce a cytosolic [Ca2+] increase (36Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and more specifically, DAG analogs induced an influx of Mn2+ in hTRPC6-transfected cells (22Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). However, in HEK-t6.11 cells, 20-HETE (1–30 μm) was not able to increase [Ca2+]i or induce Mn2+ influx (data not shown). One possibility could be related to the intrinsic nature of 20-HETE itself. Indeed, in Sf9 cells expressing the dTRPL channel, a significant correlation was found between intracellular Ca2+ increase and current activation for linoleic acid and linolenic acid. However, 1-stearyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and AA, strong activators of dTRPL current, were less potent or ineffective, respectively, in causing a rise in intracellular Ca2+ (43Estacion M. Sinkins W.G.

It has been reported to inhibit the activity of Ca2+-activated K+ channels, which depolarize the membrane to open L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (44Harder D.R. Campbell W.B. Roman R.J. J. Vasc. Res. 1995; 32: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 45Zou A.P. Fleming J.T. Falck J.R. Jacobs E.R. Gebremedhin D. Harder D.R. Roman R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R228-R337PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, our results suggest that the current passing through mTRPC6 would drive the membrane potential toward 0 mV, the reversal potential of mTRPC6, and could thus favor the opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. However, smooth muscle contraction induced by various agonists was only partially inhibited by L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (46Tao L. Huang Y. Bourreau J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279 (L332): L722Google Scholar), indicating that L-type voltage-gated calcium channels do not entirely support the observed Ca2+ influx. A role for non-selective cation channels in Ca2+ entry during Ca2+ wavelike oscillations in vascular smooth muscle has been proposed by Van Breemen and colleagues (for a review, see Ref. 47Lee C.H. Poburko D. Kuo K.H. Seow C.Y. van Breemen C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1571-H1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The opening of non-selective cation channels triggered an influx of Na+ ions, which were then extruded by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, functioning in reverse mode, allowing Ca2+ entry. These Ca2+ oscillations were slowed by the addition of nifedipine but blocked by (2-aminoethoxy)-diphenylborane, a blocker of SOC (48Gregory R.B. Rychkov G. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) or 2,4-dichlorobenzamyl, a blocker of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Overall, the results herein describe the novel mechanism of activation of a TRP member by a bioactive eicosanoid, 20-HETE, of physiological relevance for a number of different tissues including kidney and vascular and airway smooth muscle. These data offer new insight into determining the components participating in the observed 20-HETE-regulated membrane depolarization of vascular smooth muscle cells.

https://openalex.org/W2056233575,"Chronic exposure to lower oxygen tension may increase cellular resistance to different types of acute metabolic stress. Here, we show that 24-h-long exposure to slightly decreased oxygen tension (partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 100 mm Hg instead of normal 144 mm Hg) confers resistance against acute hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced Ca2+ loading in heart-derived H9c2 cells. The number of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels were increased in cells exposed to PO2 = 100 mm Hg relative to cells exposed to PO2 = 144 mm Hg. This was due to an increase in transcription of SUR2A, a KATP channel regulatory subunit, but not Kir6.2, a KATP channel poreforming subunit. PO2 = 100 mm Hg also increased the SUR2 gene promoter activity. Experiments with cells overexpressing wild type of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and dominant negative HIF-1β suggested that the HIF-1-signaling pathway did not participate in observed PO2-mediated regulation of SUR2A expression. On the other hand, NADH inhibited the effect of PO2 = 100 mm Hg but not the effect of PO2 = 20 mm Hg. LY 294002 and PD 184 352 prevented PO2-mediated regulation of KATP channels, whereas rapamycin was without any effect. HMR 1098 inhibited the cytoprotective effect of PO2 = 100 mm Hg, and a decrease of PO2 from 144 to 100 mm Hg did not change the expression of any other gene, including those involved in stress and hypoxic response, as revealed by Affymetrix high density oligonucleotide arrays. We conclude that slight hypoxia activates HIF-1α-independent signaling cascade leading to an increase in SUR2A protein, a higher density of KATP channels, and a cellular phenotype more resistant to acute metabolic stress.

A chronic lack of oxygen has been implicated in variety of diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes, pulmonary fibrosis, neurodegenerative disorders, arthritis, and aging. At the cellular level, hypoxia activates numerous major signaling pathways, resulting in changes in gene expression, which influence the cellular ability to survive or die. These pathways exert their phenotypic influences largely through modulation of transcription factor activities that effect changes in the pattern of gene expression, and some of these pathways are linked to enhanced survival, whereas others are associated with cell death. Severe hypoxia, occurring at partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) 1The abbreviations used are: PO2, partial pressure of oxygen; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; AP-1, activator protein-1; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin.1The abbreviations used are: PO2, partial pressure of oxygen; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; AP-1, activator protein-1; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin. below 20 mm Hg, impairs cellular energy production and ion homeostasis, leading to cell injury and cell death. In contrast, a lower degree of hypoxia, defined as PO2 between 50 and 100 mm Hg, may activate mechanisms that could produce cellular phenotype more resistant to acute severe oxidative stress (1Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar, 2Wenger R.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was in particular described in the heart, where acute severe oxidative stress is one of the most important components of different forms of ischemic heart diseases, including myocardial infarction. At the single cell level, it has been shown that isolated cardiomyocytes when cultured at lower oxygen tension acquire resistance against acute severe oxidative stress (3Silverman H.S. Wei S. Haigney M.C. Ocampo C.J. Stern M.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Such single cell reports have been strongly supported by clinical studies showing that the incidence of myocardial infarction complications and the mortality rate are much lower in populations living at lower PO2 than those of the rest of the world (4Ashouri K. Ahmed M.E. Kardash M.O. Sharif A.Y. Abdalsattar M. al Ghozeim A. Ethn. Dis. 1994; 4: 82-86PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hutchison S.J. Litch J.A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1997; 278: 1661-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). How moderate hypoxia induces increased cellular resistance to acute severe oxidative stress is yet unknown. In this regard, the present study was undertaken to address this question and to define the molecular basis of chronic mild hypoxia regulation of cellular resistance to acute metabolic challenges. To achieve this, we applied a set of different techniques on heart-derived H9c2 cells, cells that have been previously successfully implemented to study mechanisms of cellular and cardiac protection (6Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius F.C. Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: e70-e77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ranki H.J. Budas G.R. Crawford R.M. Davies A.M. Jovanović A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2002; 40: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Using this approach we found that chronic minimal hypoxia up-regulates SUR2A subunit of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel without affecting expression of any other gene. This effect is not associated with activation of HIF-1α-dependent signaling pathway, whereas changes in the NAD/NADH ratio and activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) seem to be crucial for the cytoprotective effect of chronic mild hypoxia. A sole increase in SUR2A protein is sufficient to generate more sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels and create a cellular phenotype resistant to acute severe oxidative stress. Heart H9c2 Cells and Gene Transfection—Rat embryonic heart H9c2 cells (ECACC, Salisbury, UK) were cultured in a tissue flask (at 5% CO2) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. For some experiments in culture media NADH (20 mm), NAD (20 mm), PD 184352 (10 μm), or rapamycin (1 μm) or LY294002 (50 μm) would be added. For electrophysiological and imaging experiments, the cells were plated on a 35 × 10- or 60 × 15-mm culture dish containing 12- or 25-mm glass cover-slips. The cells were cultured in incubators (Galaxy, oxygen control model, RS Biotech, Irvine, UK) where PO2 was either 144 mm Hg (21% O2, v/v), 100 mm Hg (13% O2), or 20 mm Hg (3%) for 24 h before the experiment. For some experiments H9c2 cells were transfected with HIF-1α (pCMVhHIF-1α) plus HIF-1β/ARNT (pCMVhARNT) or dominant negative ARNT/HIF-1β mutant (pCMVβARNT) or with a ∼1200-bp SUR2 gene promoter fragment flanking the 5′ end of SUR2 gene subcloned in TOPO-Glow vector (Invitrogen; for details see below) and then cultured for 24 h (HIF-1α/HIF-1β or HIF-1β mutant transfected cells were cultured on PO2 = 144 mm Hg and PO2 = 100 mm Hg, respectively, whereas promoter-transfected cells were cultured under both conditions). With HIF-1 subunits and HIF-1β dominant negative subunit, green fluorescent protein (GFP) subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+ was routinely cotransfected to enable cell selection for electrophysiology. The cells were transfected with total of 1–2 μg of plasmid DNA at 60–80% confluence using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Digital Epifluorescent Microscopy—H9c2 cells were superfused with Tyrode solution and loaded with the esterified form of the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probe Fura-2 (Fura-2AM, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide plus pluronic acid; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were imaged using a digital epifluorescence imaging system coupled to an inverted microscope (Image Solutions, Standish, UK). A mercury lamp served as a source of light to excite Fura-2AM at 340 and 380 nm. Fluorescence emitted at 520 nm was captured, after crossing dichroic mirrors, by an intensified charge coupled device camera and digitized using an imaging software. An estimate of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, as a function of Fura-2 fluorescence, was calculated according to the equation: [Ca2+] = (R – R min/R max – R)K dβ, where R is the fluorescence ratio recorded from the cell, R min and R max are the minimal and maximal fluorescence ratios, K d is the dissociation constant of the dye (236 nm), and β is the ratio of minimum to maximum fluorescence at 380 nm. Hypoxia/reoxygenation was induced in the absence and presence of 100 μm HMR 1098 (Avis Pharma, Frankfurt, Germany) as follows. Single field-stimulated (30 mV, 5 ms, 0.5 Hz) cells were perfused with Tyrode solution containing 136.5 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.53 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 5.5 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) at a rate of 1 ml/min. Under these conditions the PO2 in perfusate was ∼140 mm Hg. For hypoxia the solution was continuously bubbled with 100% argon, whereas the exchange of O2 between solution in the chamber and air was prevented by nitrogen jet. The PO2 under these conditions was ∼20 mm Hg. The duration of hypoxia was 10 min, followed by reoxygenation with Tyrode solution for 10 min. Electrophysiology—The cells were superfused with Tyrode solution (136.5 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.53 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 5.5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4). Pipettes (resistance 3–5 MΩ) were filled with 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 5 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3). The recordings were made at room temperature (22 °C). During each experiment, the membrane potential was normally held at –40 mV, and the currents evoked by a series of 400-ms current steps (–100mV to +80 mV in 20-mV steps) were recorded directly to hard disk using an Axopatch-200B amplifier, Digidata-1321 interface, and pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Forster City, CA). The capacitance compensation was adjusted to null the additional whole cell capacitative current. The slow capacitance component measured by this procedure was used as an approximation of the cell surface area and allowed normalization of current amplitude (i.e. current density). The currents were low pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analysis—Sheep anti-peptide antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides comprised of residues 33–47 in the Kir6.2 protein (ARFVSKKGNCNVAHK) and residues 311–32 in the SUR2A protein (CIVQRVNETQNGTNN), conjugated to a carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. To obtain the membrane fraction, H9c2 cardiac cells were homogenized in buffer I (10 mm Tris, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.8) and incubated for 20 min (at 4 °C). The osmolarity was restored with KCl, NaCl, and sucrose, and the obtained mixture was centrifuged at 500 × g. The supernatant was diluted in buffer II (30 mm imidazole, 120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 250 mm sucrose, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 6.8) and centrifuged at 7000 × g, the pellet was removed, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 30,000 × g. The obtained pellet contains membrane fraction. The protein concentration was determined using the method of Bradford. 10 μg of the epitope-specific Kir6.2 antibody or 40 μg of the epitope-specific SUR2A antibody was prebound to protein G-Sepharose beads and used to immunoprecipitate from 50 μg of membrane fraction protein extract. The pellets of this precipitation were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels for Western analysis. Western blot probing was performed using 1:1000 dilutions of anti-SUR2A and anti-Kir6.2 antibody, respectively, and detection was achieved using protein G horseradish peroxidase and ECL reagents. Essentially the same protocol was used when Western blot was done with phospho-AP-1 (Abcam, Cambridge), phospho-c-Jun (Abcam), and phospho-C/EBP (Santa Cruz) antibodies on untransfected cells or with anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen) on cells transfected with the GFP construct containing putative SUR2 promoter fragments (see below); just the total proteins, instead of immunoprecipitates, obtained from H9c2 cells were used, and dilutions of these antibodies were 1:300 to 1:500. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using a commercial kit (RNeasy, Mini Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized with random hexanucleotides from 1 mg of total RNA using a reverse transcription system kit (Promega, Southampton, UK). PCR was done using ReadyMix Red Tag from Sigma in a thermal cycler Model Phoenix (Helena Biosciences, Sunderland, UK) under the following conditions: for Kir6.2, 94 °C for 3 min, 34 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 66.1 °C for 0.5 min, and 70 °C for 1 min, and the final extension at 70 °C for 5 min; for SUR2A, the conditions were the same as for Kir6.2 except that number of cycles was 37–49, and the annealing temperature was 66.1 °C. Two different sets of primers were used to verify any found differences. The primers had the following sequences; for the 387-base-long product for rat Kir6.2 (primer 1), sense, 5′-ATGCGCAAGACCACCAGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGGCGGGCTGTGCAGAG-3′; for the 255-base-long product for rat Kir6.2 (primer 2), sense, 5′-GCACCAATGTGCCCTGCGTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CGGGGTGATCACGGCATGCT-3′; for the 375-base-long product for rat SUR2A (primer 1), sense, 5′-CTAGACGCCACTGTCAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGAGAACGAGACACTTGG-3′; and for the 251-base-long product for rat SUR2A (primer 2), sense, 5′-GAGTGTCAGACCTGCGCTTCT-3′, and antisense, 5′-GCTGCTCAGCAGGATTGGTCTC-3′. The levels of GAPDH mRNA was also tested using human GAPDH-primers: sense, 5′-CATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGATGG-3′, the size of the GAPDH product was 341 bp). There were no significant differences in intensity of GAPDH levels between experimental groups. The nature of the PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. These conditions were set based on our preliminary studies that have demonstrated that under these conditions intensity of the PCR product bend is ∼50% of its maximum. The PCR product band intensities were analyzed using Quantiscan software. DNA Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells cultured at PO2 = 144 mm Hg and PO2 = 100 mm Hg as described for the use of Affymetrix microarrays (8Lee C.K. Klopp R.G. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Target RNA was prepared by converting 1 μg of RNA into double-stranded cDNA (Superscript Choice System; Invitrogen) with a T7-(dT)24 primer incorporating a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Biotin-labeled cRNA was synthesized from cDNA by using an RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Biochem). After complementary RNA had been fragmented to sizes ranging from 35 to 200 bases by heating (35 min at 95 °C), 10 μg of RNA fragments were hybridized (16 h at 45 °C) to a Rat Genome U34A array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). After hybridization, chips were automatically washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin by using a fluidics system. The chips were scanned with a Hewlett Packard GeneArray Scanner. The Affymetrix RG-U34A array contained ∼7,000 rat genes and expressed ∼1,000 sequence tags from UniGene, GenBank™, and the Institute for Genomic Research data bases. Each gene was presented in the array by 20 perfectly matched oligonucleotides and 20 mismatched control probes that contain a single central-base mismatch. Fluorescence intensity was read for each nucleotide to calculate the average signal intensity for each gene by subtracting the intensities of ∼20 perfectly matched oligonucleotides from the intensity of the mismatched nucleotides. All of the calculations were performed using Affymetrix MAS 4.0 algorithm, i.e. all of the arrays were scaled to an overall target intensity of 100 prior to comparative analysis. Groups (PO2 = 144 mm Hg and PO2 = 100 mm Hg) were compared with each other by pair-wise comparison. Using this method, genes that were present and changed in expression by at least 1.4-fold were meant to be identified. High Performance Liquid Chromatography—The cells were rapidly frozen, and 0.73 m trichloroacetic acid was added. The solution was then homogenized and centrifuged. The supernatant was removed and placed in tri-n-octylamine and FREON (50:50, v/v), vortex-mixed, and centrifuged. The supernatant was taken and used for HPLC. A Nova-Pak (Reading, UK) C18 4-μm spherical radii bead, dimension 300 × 3.9 mm inner diameter column was used. A mobile phase consisting of 12% methanol, 1.47 mm tetrabutylammonium phosphate, 73.5 mm KH2PO4, adjusted to pH 4.0. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. NADH and NAD were detected at 254 nm (under these conditions retention times were 9.3 min for NAD and 24.0 min for NADH) using a Varien ProStar HPLC work station (Kinesis, Epping, UK). Cloning, Subcloning, and Use of Human SUR2 Gene Promoter—For the human SUR2 promoter analysis, a fragment extending 1200 bases downwards from the translation initiation triplet was cloned from human genomic DNA (Promega). The sense primer was 5′-GACCTTTGCTCATCTCCCATC-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-TTTCTTCTTATATGGTTTACTCTAA-3′; PCR was done using Promega PCR core system components. In these reactions the magnesium concentration was 1.87 mm, and the PCR mixtures were run at 94 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 70 °C for 2 min; and a final extension of 70 °C for 5 min. The PCR product was cloned into TOPO-Glow vector using the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). To create a 380-base-long fragment, a 1200-base-long fragment of putative SUR2 promoter PCR product was fragmented by restriction digestion using the internal BglII site (380 bases from the start codon). 380-bp fragment was blunt end-ligated into TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The plasmids were transiently transfected into H9c2 cells using Qiagen Superfect reagent and the manufacturer's protocol (see above), the cells were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C (at 5% CO2)onPO2 = 144 mm Hg or PO2 = 100 mm Hg, and the RNA was extracted. 1 μg of RNA was treated with 0.5 Kunitz units of DNase (Qiagen RNase-free DNase kit). DNase-treated RNA was used to make cDNA in a total volume of 20 μl. ∼10% of the cDNA was used in a single PCR to analyze the promoter activity using GFP-specific primers, sense primer was 5′-GGTGATGCTACATACGGAA-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-TACCTGTCGACACAATCTG-3′. The PCR-run conditions for GFP-primers were 94 °C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 52 °C for 0.5 min, and 70 °C for 1 min; and a final extension of 70 °C for 5 min. The cDNA was also analyzed for the presence of the vector using promoter-specific primers. The obtained data have been analyzed as described under “RT-PCR.” Statistics—The data are presented as the means ± S.E., with n representing the number of experiments. The mean values between two groups were compared by the paired or unpaired Student's t test or Rank tests where appropriate. The results for Kir6.2 and SUR2A obtained with RT-PCR for each sample were normalized taking into account that the mean values between more then two groups were compared by the one-way or one-way Rank analysis of variance. All of the statistical tests were done using the SigmaStat program (Jandel Scientific). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Chronic Mild Hypoxia Confers Resistance to Acute Hypoxia/Reoxygenation-induced Ca2 + Loading in H9c2 Cells—Intracellular Ca2+ loading is a reliable on-line parameter of a metabolic condition in mammalian cells, including heart-derived H9c2 cells (7Ranki H.J. Budas G.R. Crawford R.M. Davies A.M. Jovanović A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2002; 40: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Under control conditions (cells cultured at PO2 = 140 mm Hg), hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced Ca2+ loading in all cells tested, suggesting that this cellular phenotype is sensitive to such an insult (Fig. 1, A and C). In contrast, the same insult produced intracellular Ca2+ loading only in 8.3% of cells chronically exposed to PO2 = 100 mm Hg (Fig. 1, B and C). Chronic Mild Hypoxia Increased the Number of K ATP Channels in Plasma Membrane by Regulating Expression of SUR2A Subunit—It has been previously shown that the density of KATP channels may regulate cellular resistance to oxidative stress (7Ranki H.J.

Cardiol. 2001; 38: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This strategy revealed more than 2-fold higher levels of Kir6.2 and SUR2A proteins in cells cultured at mild hypoxia compared with those cultured at normoxia (Fig. 2; band density, for Kir6.2 11 ± 3 and 19 ± 2 under control conditions and hypoxia, respectively, and for SUR2A 18 ± 2 and 35 ± 5 under control conditions and hypoxia, respectively; p < 0.01 in both cases; n = 5 for each), although at the same time no significant changes were observed in amounts of secondary antibody heavy chain (for Kir6.2 21.6 ± 2.5 and 20.6 ± 3.2 under control conditions and hypoxia, respectively, and for SUR2A 16.2 ± 1.1 and 16.8 ± 1 under control conditions and hypoxia, respectively; p = 0.59 and 0.37 for Kir6.2 and SUR2A, respectively; n = 5 for each). To determine whether changes in the transcriptional activity of Kir6.2 and SUR2 genes underlie changes in number of plasmalemmal KATP channels, we measured Kir6.2 and SUR2A mRNAs using RT-PCR. We designed two separate sets of primers (see the methods), and we tested whether the primers that we designed and RT-PCR could detect differences in mRNA levels. Therefore, we applied RT-PCR with two sets of Kir6.2 and SUR2A primers on slightly different amounts of DNA template using the same number of cycles. These experiments have demonstrated that the primers and conditions we used are capable of detecting less then 2-fold differences in mRNA (Fig. 3) and that >30 amplification cycles used in this study would not lose difference in initial message. Thus, RT-PCR analysis with two different sets of primers for each subunit demonstrated that levels of Kir6.2 mRNA did not change by mild hypoxia (Fig. 4, B and D). In contrast, >2-fold higher levels of SUR2A mRNA in cells exposed to PO2 = 100 mm Hg relative to those exposed to PO2 = 144 mm Hg were found (Fig. 4, A and C).

H9c2 cells were transfected with the 1200-bp fragment of the putative human SUR2 promoter subcloned into the GFP promoterless vector. Under these conditions the transcription of GFP was directly dependent upon activity of SUR2 promoter. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a >2-fold higher level of GFP mRNA in cells cultured at PO2 = 100 mm Hg compared with those cultured at PO2 = 144 mm Hg (Fig. 5, A and B). No difference was observed between GAPDH levels in transfected cells irrespective of PO2 (Fig. 5C). A computer-assisted search using putative human SUR2 gene promoter sequence revealed the presence of binding sites for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors. Mild hypoxia increased phosphorylation of AP-1 transcription factors and in particular c-Jun, whereas phosphorylation of C/EBP was not increased (Fig. 5D). The obtained RT-PCR results with promoter were further confirmed at the level of expressed GFP protein. In H9c2 cells transfected with GFP promoterless vector, no signal for GFP on a Western blot using anti-GFP antibody was visualized (Fig. 5E). On the other hand, when constructs containing a 1200- or 380-bp putative promoter fragment were introduced into H9c2 cells, GFP was detected in total protein extract (Fig. 5E). Exposure to mild hypoxia increased the level of expressed GFP regardless of whether cells were transfected with the 1200- or 380-bp putative promoter fragment (Fig. 5E). Chronic Mild Hypoxia-induced Increase in Number of Sarcolemmal K ATP Channels Is Independent on HIF-1α—It is well established that chronic hypoxia regulates genes expression primarily via HIF-1 (11Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). To determine whether HIF-1 mediates mild hypoxia-induced increase in the number of KATP channels, we employed patch clamp electrophysiology on untransfected and transfected H9c2 cells exposed to different oxygen tensions. Pinacidil, a prototype KATP channel opener, induces whole cell K+ current proportionally to the number of KATP channels in membrane (7Ranki H.J. Budas G.R. Crawford R.M. Davies A.M. Jovanović A. J.

https://openalex.org/W2065666472,"Cells migrating directionally toward a chemoattractant source display a highly polarized cytoskeletal organization, with F-actin localized predominantly at the anterior and myosin II at the lateral and posterior regions. Dictyostelium discoideum has proven a useful system for elucidating signaling pathways that regulate this chemotactic response. During development, extracellular adenosine 3', 5' monophosphate (cAMP) functions as a primary signal to activate cell surface cAMP receptors (cARs). These receptors transduce different signals depending on whether or not they are coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) (see the STKE Connections Maps). Multiple G protein-stimulated pathways interact to establish polarity in chemotaxing D. discoideum cells by localizing F-actin at their leading edge and by regulating the phosphorylation state and assembly of myosin II. Many of the molecular interactions described are fundamental to the regulation of chemotaxis in other eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036263649,"In most eukaryotes cytokinesis is brought about by a contractile actin ring located at the division plane. Here, in fission yeast the actin ring was found to be required to generate late-mitotic microtubular structures located at the division plane, and these in turn maintained the medial position of the actin ring. When these microtubular structures were disrupted, the actin ring migrated away from the cell middle in a membrane traffic–dependent manner, resulting in asymmetrical cell divisions that led to genomic instability. We propose that these microtubular structures contribute to a checkpoint control that retains the equatorial position of the ring when progression through cytokinesis is delayed."

Caffeine, a nonspecific inhibitor of ATM and ATR (36Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar) sensitizes AT cells to IR-induced killing (37Asaad N.A. Zeng Z.-C. Guan J. Thacker J. Iliakis G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5788-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting that the target of caffeine in AT cells might be ATR which is critical for AT cell survival. We show here that the prolonged G2 checkpoint in irradiated human AT cells without ATM function correlates with the overactivated ATR/CHK1 pathway following IR. Like caffeine (a nonspecific inhibitor of ATR) or UCN-01 (a nonspecific inhibitor of CHK1), Chk1 siRNA also abolishes the IR-induced prolonged G2 checkpoint and radiosensitize AT cells to killing. These results clearly demonstrate that an overactivated ATR/CHK1 pathway is responsible for the IR-induced prolonged G2 checkpoint in AT cells and that this checkpoint is important for maintaining AT cell survival. Cell Lines, Chemical Treatment, and Irradiation—Both GM847 (ATM+/+) and AT5BIVA (ATM–/–) cells are transformed human fibroblasts. These cells were adapted to growing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% iron-supplemented calf serum (Sigma). The incubations were at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Caffeine (Sigma) or UCN-01 (NCI) was added to the culture 30 min before the cells were exposed to x-rays (310 kV, 10 mA, 2-mm aluminum filter) and remained in the culture after IR until the cells were collected. One- and Two-parameter Flow Cytometry Assay—For propidium iodide (PI) one-parameter assay, cells were collected at different times following IR and stained with PI solution as described previously (38Hu B. Zhou X.Y. Wang X. Zeng Z.C. Iliakis G. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17693-17698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Sigma) and PI, a two-parameter assay, we followed the method described by McKay et al. (39McKay B.C. Becerril C. Spronck J.C. Ljungman M. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Thirty μm BrdUrd was added to the growth medium immediately following IR and was maintained in the medium until cells were collected (24 h following IR). The FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody was purchased from Dako Co. After cell collection, the cells were incubated with the antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were assessed by a flow cytometer (Coulter Epics Elite) for PI (DNA content) and FITC (DNA synthesis) measurements. ATR Kinase Activity Assay—ATR activity was examined with a chromatin-bound extract prepared as described previously (40Wang X. Li G.C. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6031-6034PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins were then extracted with cold 0.1% Triton X-100 in CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiotheitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min at 4 °C. The sample was then pelleted by low speed centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was named fraction 1. These pellets were then re-extracted by incubating in CSK buffer and were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. This supernatant was named fraction 2. The final pellet fraction (containing chromatin-bound proteins) was solubilized in radioimmunopreciptation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and was named fraction 3. For kinase assay, 500 μg of fraction 3 was mixed with 2 μg of ATR antibody (sc-1887, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in the presence of 20 μl of a 50% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose slurry (Invitrogen) in 500 μl of Buffer A (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4,5mm NaF, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in phosphate-buffered saline buffer) and gently rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with Buffer A, then twice with Buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase immunoprecipitate was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 1 μg of PHAS-1 (Stratagene) in 25 μl of Buffer B containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and the kinase activities determined by the incorporation of 32P into PHAS-1 protein using a PhosphorImager. Purification of GST-CDC25C 200–256 —BL21 cells were transformed with plasmid pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) encoding CDC25C200–256. The GST-CDC25C200–256 was purified by using the microspin™ GST purification module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CHK1 Kinase Activity Assay—Cell extracts were prepared for this purpose by using the NE-PER™ kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nuclear extracts (250 μg) were then mixed with 1 μg of CHK1 antibody (sc-7898, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in the presence of 10 μl of a 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose slurry (Repligen). The following procedures are similar to those described previously (41Wang H. Wang X. Zhou X.Y. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2483-2487PubMed Google Scholar), except that kinase buffer without NaCl was used. Western Blot—The nuclear extracts were used for Western blot (ATR, CHK1, CDC25A, and CDC2) assay. The whole cell lyses were used for Western blot detecting phospho-CHK1. The ATR antibody (sc-1887), CHK1 antibody (sc-8404), CDC25A antibody (sc-7389), and CDC2 antibody (sc-54) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Phospho-CHK1 (Ser345) antibody was purchased from Cell Signal Technology. CDC2 Phosphorylation and Kinase Activity Assay—The CDC2 (also called CDK1) phosphorylation and CDC2 kinase assay are similar to previous reports (40Wang X. Li G.C. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6031-6034PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared using the NE-PER™ kit (Pierce) for the kinase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nuclear extracts (250 μg) were then mixed with 1 μg of CDC2 antibody (sc-54, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in the presence of 10 μl of a 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose slurry (Repligen) for the measurement of CDC2 activity as described before (40Wang X. Li G.C. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6031-6034PubMed Google Scholar), except that kinase buffer without NaCl was used. Colony-forming Assay—Cellular sensitivity to radiation was determined by the loss of colony-forming ability as described previously (38Hu B. Zhou X.Y. Wang X. Zeng Z.C. Iliakis G. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17693-17698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Transfection of Chk1 siRNA—The Chk1 siRNA was designed to specifically target the sequence of 127–147 from the start codon region of the human Chk1 mRNA (5′-AAGCGUGCCGUAGACUGUCCA-3′) (32Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The siRNA was synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. The scramble duplex RNA (Dharmacon Research Inc.) was used as the control RNA. The RNAs were delivered to the cells by OLIGOFECTAMINE™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were analyzed 36 h posttransfection. Prolonged G 2 Accumulation in Irradiated AT Cells Is Abolished by Kinase Inhibitors—Cells from AT patients have been reported to exhibit a prolonged G2 accumulation after exposure to IR (19Beamish H. Lavin M.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22Tatsuka M. Nikaido O. Tatsumi K. Takebe H. Mutat.

Cell. 2002; 22: 1049-1059Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar), suggesting that an overactivated G2 checkpoint exists in irradiated AT cells. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether this G2 accumulation in irradiated AT cells was a reversible process. We treated AT cells with 4 mm caffeine (a nonspecific inhibitor of ATM and ATR) or with 100 nm UCN-01 (a nonspecific inhibitor of CHK1). We observed that both caffeine (data not shown) and UCN-01 clearly reduced the G2 accumulation in AT cells (Fig. 1A), explaining that the inhibitor blocked the IR-induced G2 checkpoint. To exclude the possibility that the inhibitor held the irradiated cells in S phase resulting in fewer cells entering G2 phase, we observed BrdUrd and PI, the double-labeled signals in both IR and the inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 1B). The results (Fig. 1 and Table I) showed that there is not much difference of S phase ration between the cells treated and those not treated with the inhibitor. This indicates that the prolonged G2 accumulation in irradiated AT cells reflects a cellular active G2 checkpoint that is sensitive to caffeine or to UCN-01.Table ICell cycle distribution in ATM-/- and ATM+/+ cellsTotal cell populationATM-/-ATM+/+G1SG2/MG1SG2/M%%PI only542333512029PI + BrdUrd, 0502228551827PI + BrdUrd, R71578502129PI + BrdUrd, UCN-01, 0472330502822PI + BrdUrd, UCN-01, R382438502921 Open table in a new tab Abolishing the Prolonged G 2 Accumulation with Kinase Inhibitors Sensitizes AT Cells to IR-induced Killing—It is known that AT cells are very sensitive to IR-induced killing. However, it remains unknown whether the prolonged G2 accumulation observed after irradiation contributes to the survival of AT cells. Checkpoint activation facilitates cell DNA repair; thus, prolonged G2 accumulation should play a protective role for AT cell survival. Previous work provides hints that this might indeed be the case (37Asaad N.A. Zeng Z.-C. Guan J. Thacker J. Iliakis G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5788-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we examined the radiosensitivity in irradiated AT cells under conditions in which the IR-induced G2 arrest was abolished. After the prolonged G2 accumulation was abolished by caffeine or UCN-01, AT cells became much more sensitive to IR-induced killing (Fig. 2), suggesting that this prolonged G2 accumulation in irradiated AT cells is important for cell survival. A Highly Activated ATR/CHK1 Pathway Exists in Irradiated AT Cells—To test whether the caffeine-sensitive response in AT cells is regulated by the ATR pathway, we measured ATR activity in the wild-type and in AT cells. There was no difference in ATR activity between irradiated and control samples from both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts (data not shown). However, ATR activity of the chromatin-bound fraction was higher in irradiated (12 h) than in non-irradiated cells for both cell lines (Fig. 3A), suggesting that this pool of ATR contains the protein activated in response to DNA damage. When compared with the non-irradiated controls, the level of ATR activity increased in irradiated AT cells more than in irradiated wild-type cells (Fig. 3B), indicating an overactivated ATR in irradiated AT cells. The main downstream target of ATR for regulating the checkpoint is CHK1. CHK1 is an important G2 checkpoint regulator in mammalian cells exposed to IR (32Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 38Hu B. Zhou X.Y. Wang X. Zeng Z.C. Iliakis G. Wang Y. J. Biol.

Although CHK2 is also implicated in IR-induced G2 checkpoint (42Zhou B.-B.S. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), the CHK2-regulated response depends on ATM kinase (10Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 42Zhou B.-B.S. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, the prolonged G2 accumulation in irradiated AT cells (ATM–/–) is not likely to be regulated by this kinase. We next examined whether the CHK1 pathway was involved in the prolonged G2 accumulation in irradiated AT cells. Although the phosphorylation of CHK1 in cells following IR is hard to detect by using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (30Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we observed more phosphorylated CHK1 in irradiated AT cells than the wild-type control cells by increasing the radiation dose (20 Gy) and by using the whole cell lyses (Fig. 3A). Higher CHK1 kinase activities in both irradiated wild-type and AT cells as compared with the non-irradiated controls (Fig. 3A) were observed. The increased ratio of CHK1 activity in irradiated AT cells is much higher than that in irradiated wild-type control cells at 12 h following IR (6 Gy) (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that CHK1 is more activated in irradiated AT cells. The G2 checkpoint is believed to be mediated by an inhibition of the CDC25 phosphatase that activates the CDC2 kinase by removing inhibitory phosphates (Thr14 and Tyr15), thus allowing entry into mitosis (20Beamish H. Williams R. Chen P. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20486-20493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genet. 2002; 30: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). CHK1 could regulate IR-induced G2 checkpoint by phosphorylating CDC25A, which results in CDC25A degradation (32Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To examine whether activation of the CHK1 kinase was associated with CDC25A protein level changes in irradiated AT cells, we examined the CDC25A levels. The results (Fig. 3A) showed that less CDC25A protein was observed in AT cells than in the wild-type control cells following IR (6 Gy). We next measured CDC2 activity. The results are consistent with those of CHK1 activation (Fig. 3) and of G2 arrest (Fig. 1). The CDC2 activities decreased in both wild-type and AT cells at 12 h after IR (6 Gy), but the changes were more apparent in AT cells (Fig. 3, A and B). These observations suggest that CDC25A and CDC2 are the downstream effectors of CHK1 in the regulation of the G2 arrest in AT cells. Chk1 siRNA Abolishes the Prolonged G 2 Accumulation and Radiosensitizes the Cells to IR—To confirm that the ATR/CHK1 pathway is responsible for the prolonged G2 accumulation in irradiated AT cells, we examined the effects of Chk1 siRNA on this checkpoint response. The Chk1 siRNA specifically inhibited CHK1 expression in the transfected cells (Fig. 4A) and reduced the prolonged G2 accumulation in irradiated AT cells (Fig. 4B). By using BrdUrd and PI, the double-labeled method, we observed the effects of Chk1 siRNA on BrdUrd incorporation. Similar with the UCN-01 results, Chk1 siRNA did not hold the irradiated cells in S phase (data not shown), which probably is also because of the role of CHK1 in abolishing the S checkpoint (21Zhou X.Y. Wang X. Hu B. Guan J. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1598-1603PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). These results provide direct evidence that the ATR/CHK1 pathway plays a key role in the prolonged G2 arrest of irradiated AT cells. To study the relationship between G2 checkpoint response and radiosensitivity, we examined the radiosensitivity of AT cells after abolishing their G2 checkpoint response by Chk1 siRNA. Chk1 siRNA radiosensitized both wild-type and AT cells, but the sensitization in AT cells is larger than that in wild-type cells (Fig. 4C), indicating that this component of the checkpoint response is more critical in AT cells than in wild-type cells. The AT phenotype of prolonged G2 accumulation following IR was reported by different groups several years ago (19Beamish H. Lavin M.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22Tatsuka M. Nikaido O. Tatsumi K. Takebe H. Mutat. Res. 1989; 214: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Scott D. Spreadborough A.R. Roberts S.A. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: S157-S163Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanism remained unknown (24Xu B. Kim S-T. Lim D-S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 22: 1049-1059Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Our results indicate for the first time that the prolonged G2 accumulation in irradiated AT cells is regulated by the ATR/CHK1 pathway. Although ATM and ATR are two of the most important DNA damage signal transducers in mammalian cells (4Zhou B.-B.S. Elledge S.J.

Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), it was generally believed that ATM mainly responded to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by IR or chemical agents, and ATR mainly responded to other types of DNA damage induced by UV or chemical agents. Additional evidence now demonstrates that besides ATM, ATR is also a very important checkpoint regulator in IR-irradiated cells (21Zhou X.Y. Wang X. Hu B. Guan J. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1598-1603PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H.

Our results show that both ATR and its substrate, CHK1, are overactivated in AT cells following IR. Furthermore, the IR-induced, prolonged G2 accumulation in AT cells is abolished by blocking the ATR/CHK1 pathway, indicating that the overactivated ATR/CHK1 pathway is responsible for the prolonged G2 accumulation in irradiated AT cells. Following IR, activation of the ATM pathway is observed almost immediately in mammalian cells (14Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 21Zhou X.Y. Wang X. Hu B. Guan J. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1598-1603PubMed Google Scholar, 24Xu B. Kim S-T.

Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). Activation of the ATR/CHK1 pathway is observed about 1 h later and reaches a maximum level at about the 3-h time point (21Zhou X.Y. Wang X. Hu B. Guan J. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1598-1603PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggests that ATM and ATR regulate different pathways in response to the induction of DNA DSBs. ATM could be activated from a trans-acting process immediately by changes in the structure of chromatin induced by DSBs (50Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). Alternately, ATM could be activated from combination of a trans-acting (changes in the structure of chromatin) and a cis-acting (DNA-binding) process that either through ATM directly binding to DNA DSBs (51Smith G.C.M. Cary R.B. Lakin N.D. Hann B.C. Teo S.-H. Chen D.J. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11134-11139Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 52Zhou X.-Y. Wang X. Wang H. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or by other DNA-binding protein formed complexes with ATM (53Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), thus playing a role in the initiating stage of multicheckpoints following IR. The fact of ATM-regulated S and G2-M checkpoints in a dose (IR)-dependent manner is supported more by the model of combined trans- and cis-acting processes. ATR is also a DNA binding protein (54Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 55Unsal-Kacmaz K. Makhov A.M. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6673-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATM, ATR may have a greater opportunity to interact directly with the damaged DNA induced by IR and cause the observed overactivation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that activated ATM inhibits ATR activity and AT cells without ATM showing an overactivated ATR/CHK1 pathway following IR. These hypotheses require rigorous testing. Two major DNA DSB repair pathways, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HRR), exist in mammalian cells. NHEJ is a very fast process and HRR is a relatively slow process. HRR is thought to occur mainly during S and G2 phase (56Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), suggesting that it benefits from a checkpoint that holds the cells in these phases of the cell cycle. The function of ATM is linked with HRR (57Morrison C. Sonoda E. Takao N. Shinohara A. Yamato K.-I. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ATM-dependent checkpoint facilitates HRR. Our previous data suggest that NHEJ is a process independent of checkpoints but that HRR is a checkpoint-utilizing process in vertebrate cells (58Wang X. Wang H. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Radiat. Res. 2003; 159: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 59Wang H. Wang X. Iliakis G. Wang Y. Radiat. Res. 2003; 159: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When the IR-induced prolonged G2 accumulation is abolished, ATM–/– cells became much more sensitive to killing by IR, suggesting that the ATR/CHK1-dependent checkpoint enhances cell survival by facilitating HRR as well. In summary, we show here that IR-induced prolonged G2 accumulation in irradiated AT cells reflects an ATM-independent checkpoint regulated by the ATR/CHK1 pathway. We also show that AT cells become more sensitive to IR-induced killing when this checkpoint is abrogated, indicating that it is important for the survival of irradiated AT cells.

Although PCD was initially believed to depend solely on the inability of certain neurons to obtain access to a limited supply of trophic factors, it has become apparent that the local production of death signals is also critical. In this Viewpoint, we discuss several pathways implicated in the survival of cerebellar granule cells- both pathways that protect from apoptosis and pathways that promote apoptosis-and describe how these disparate pathways converge on the final common mediators of PCD.

In linear electron transport an Fd: NADP+-oxidoreductase catalyzes the further transfer of electrons from Fd to NADP+, generating NADPH. PSI is a large multisubunit complex and the core complex consists of up to 15 subunits in eukaryotes, denoted PSI-A to PSI-O. However PSI-M is absent in higher plants. In addition, the PSI reaction center complex contains the primary electron donor P700 (a Chl a dimer), the acceptors A0 (Chl a), A1 (phylloquinone), and the three [4Fe-4S] clusters FA, FB, and FX. The core complex of PSI binds ∼100 chlorophylls and 20 carotenoids and is surrounded by additional light harvesting complexes (LHCI). LHCI is comprised of four subunits, Lhca1 to Lhca4, which are normally present in similar amounts. A search of the Arabidopsis genome has revealed two additional genes with high similarity to the other Lhca proteins, but Lhca5 and Lhca6 have so far not been found in the thylakoid membrane (1Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The subunits of PSI are all transmembrane, except for PSI-C, -D, -E, and -N; PSI-C, -D, and -E are localized on the stromal and PSI-N on the lumenal side. The composition and structure of PSI has been described in a number of recent reviews (2Chitnis P.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. 2001; 52: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 3Fromme P. Jordan P. Krauss N. Biochim. Biophys.

PSI-A and -B make up most of the core of PSI and these two subunits bind the reaction center chlorophylls, the two phylloquinones and FX. The stromal loops of PSI-A/B partly constitute the binding interface with PSI-C, PSI-D, and PSI-E. The PSI-C subunit binds FA and FB and is directly involved in the photosynthetic charge separation (6Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). No redox active cofactors are bound to any of the other PSI subunits. The x-ray structure of PSI from Synechoccocus elongatus has shown that PSI-D forms an antiparallel four-stranded β-sheet and an β-helix connecting the third and the fourth strand of the β-sheet (6Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). The C-terminal loop is extended and interacts with PSI-C and PSI-E. The overall structure of higher plant PSI is likely to be very similar to the prokaryotic PSI and cross-linking experiments have shown that PSI-D interacts with PSI-C, -E, -H, and -L in plants (7Andersen B. Koch B. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 84: 154-161Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PSI-D plays an important role for the assembly and stability of PSI. In a Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant lacking PSI-D, only the PSI-A/B proteins were present in the thylakoid membrane and none of the minor PSI subunits were detected, emphasizing the importance of PSI-D in assembly in vivo (9Chitnis P.R. Reilly P.A. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18381-18385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of PSI-D is regulated in two steps, both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The initiation of transcription of psaD appears to be regulated by phytochrome, whereas the accumulation of PSI-D is dependent on the presence of high mRNA levels and white light (10Lotan O. Cohen Y. Michaeli D. Nechushtai R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16185-16189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PSI-D is synthesized and imported into the chloroplast as a pre-protein. Pre-PSI-D associates with the PSI complex, and this association has been observed both in purified thylakoid membranes and in purified PSI complexes, thus the assembly can occur spontaneously and may not be dependent on any co-factors (11Cohen Y. Nechushtai R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However Ycf3, a protein involved in the assembly of PSI, has been shown to interact with PSI-D (12Naver H. Boudreau E. Rochaix J.D. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2731-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After binding to the PSI complex, the transit peptide is proteolytically removed and the mature PSI-D undergoes a conformational change making the association between PSI-D and the surrounding PSI subunits more tight (13Minai L. Cohen Y. Chitnis P.R. Nechushtai R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6338-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Compared with cyanobacteria, the mature eukaryotic PSI-D has an N-terminal extension of about 30 amino acid residues rich in alanine and proline. Higher plant PSI-E has a similar Ala-Pro rich N terminus of 30–40 residues, which also does not exist in cyanobacterial PSI-E. The plant PSI complex is much more stable than the cyanobacterial PSI complex and the increased stability could be because of the N-terminal extension anchoring PSI-D and -E to, for example, PSI-H (7Andersen B. Koch B. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 84: 154-161Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Naver H. Scott M.P. Andersen B. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 19-26Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In reconstitution experiments, PSI-D is essential for the stable binding of PSI-C and -E (15Li N. Zhao J. Warren P.V. Warden J.T. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7863-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal extension of higher plant PSI-D has been shown to be particularly important for the stable binding of PSI-C (14Naver H.

Chemical cross-linking of PSI in the presence of ferredoxin consistently yields a product of PSI-D and Fd (7Andersen B. Koch B. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 84: 154-161Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Merati G. Zanetti G. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 37-40Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Zilber A.L. Malkin R. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction is not dependent on the presence of other PSI subunits and has even been shown with isolated PSI-D and Fd (18Pandini V. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10707-10713Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that PSI-D has an important function in the docking of Fd. The PSI-C, -D, and -E subunits surround an indentation formed by PSI-A and -B, and this indentation has been proposed to make up the binding site for ferredoxin (6Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). Ferredoxin is a small (approximately 10 kDa), acidic protein and the binding to PSI is believed to be mediated by electrostatic interactions (19Lagoutte B. Hanley J. Bottin H. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Bottin H. Hanley J. Lagoutte B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Except for PSI-D, all the nuclear-encoded subunits of PSI have been investigated in Arabidopsis either by cosuppression, antisense, or RNA interference, or by using insertional knockout plants. The advantage of a suppression approach is that very low amounts of protein can be obtained even if the protein is encoded by two genes as is the case for PSI-D, PSI-E, and PSI-H (21Naver H. Haldrup A. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10784-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Scheller H.V. Lunde C. Haldrup A. Jensen P.E. Leister D. Functional Characterization of the Photosynthetic Apperatus in Arabidopsis thaliana. The Hawoth Press, Birghamton2003Google Scholar). The genes should, however, exhibit a certain homology. In Arabidopsis, PSI-D is encoded by two homologous genes, psaD1 and psaD2. Plants with 50% reduction of the stromal PSI-E have been characterized and they exhibited a decreased quantum yield of PSII, a higher level of QA reduction and higher sensitivity toward photoinhibition, even at low light intensities (23Varotto C. Pesaresi P. Meurer J. Oelmuller R. Steiner-Lange S. Salamini F. Leister D. Plant J. 2000; 22: 115-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of PSI-C, -D, -H, and -L were also reduced in these plants (23Varotto C. Pesaresi P. Meurer J. Oelmuller R. Steiner-Lange S. Salamini F. Leister D. Plant J. 2000; 22: 115-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pesaresi P. Lunde C. Jahns P. Tarantino D. Meuer J. Varotto C. Hirtz R.D. Soave C. Scheller H.V. Salamini F. Leister D. Planta. 2002; 21: 940-948Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Plants without the stromal PSI-C have not been obtained because of the difficulties in down-regulating chloroplast-encoded proteins. Here we describe for the first time the effect of reducing the content of the PSI-D subunit in vivo in higher plants. A. thaliana (L.) Heynh. Ecotype Columbia were used for all experiments. Plants were grown in compost in controlled environment Arabidopsis chambers (Percival AR-60 I, Boone, IA) at a photosynthetic flux of 100–120 μmol of photons m–2 s–1,20 °C, and 70% humidity. The photoperiod was 12 h for plants used for transformation and 8 h for plants used for biochemical and physiological analysis, to suppress the induction of flowering. All biochemical and physiological experiments were performed with fully expanded rosette leaves, harvested prior to stem elongation from compost-grown plants. Vector Construction and Plant Transformation—The A. thaliana psaD2 cDNA (GenBank™ accession numbers AJ245907, At1g03130, and EST307C9T7) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH) and was used as a template for PCR amplification using primers 5′-CGGCATGCATGCAACTCAAGCCGCC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTTACAAATCATAAGATTGTTTCC-3′ containing the SphI and SalI restriction sites. The 615-bp fragment was cloned in antisense orientation between the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter and 35S terminator. The insert was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Subsequently, a fragment containing the E35S promoter followed by the antisense psaD2 and the 35S terminator was excised with XbaI and ligated into the binary pPZ111 vector (25Hajdukiewiez P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Because of the high identity it was expected that this construct would down-regulate both psaD genes. The vector construct was transformed into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 (26Zambryski P. Joos H. Genetello C. Leemans J. Van Montagu M. Schell J. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid integrity in A. tumefaciens cultures used for plant transformation was verified by PCR analysis of colonies. Arabidopsis plants were transformed according to Clough and Bent (27Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 0.005% Silwett L-77 as surfactant for 5 min. Seeds were germinated on MS medium containing 2% sucrose, 50 mg–1 kanamycin sulfate, and 0.8% agar for 2 weeks and transgenic Arabidopsis plants were selected and transplanted to compost. Fluorescence Measurements—Determination of conventional fluorescence parameters was performed with a PAM 101–103 fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) using a standard setup (28Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed on wild-type plants and plants with 10 and 40% PSI-D under photon flux density ranging from 0 to 300 μmol of photons m–2 s–1. The NPQ was calculated as: (Fm – F m′)/F m′, the photochemical quenching qP was calculated as: (F m′ – FS)/(F m′ – F 0′); the quantum yield of PSII (ϕPSII) was calculated as: (F m′ – FS)/F m′ and the level of excess light energy was calculated as (1-qP) ×(F m′ – F 0′/F m′) × leaf absorbance × light absorbed by PSII × photon flux density (29Kato C.M. Hikosaka K. Hirotsu N. Makino A. Hirose T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Efficiency of PSII photochemistry was also measured in plants under growth light conditions followed by recovery in the dark for 40 min. A saturating flash was given every 10 min as outlined in Haldrup et al. (30Haldrup A. Simpson D. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31211-31218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll Determination—Total chlorophyll (Chl) and Chl a/b ratio were determined in 80% acetone according to Lichtenthaler (31Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9424) Google Scholar). To determine the total amount of chlorophyll per cm2, leaves were extracted in 80% boiling ethanol and the concentration determined according to Lichtenthaler (31Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9424) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—The amount of residual PSI-D in each individual transgenic plant was determined by immunoblotting using crude extracts (30Haldrup A. Simpson D. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31211-31218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When thylakoids were isolated from pooled plants with determined amounts of PSI-D, the final concentration of PSI-D in the thylakoid preparation was determined by immunoblotting. Isolated thylakoids from dark-adapted plants or crude extracts from plants harvested after a 4-h light period (for Fd and Fd:NADP+-oxidoreductase) were analyzed in similar immunoblotting procedures using antibodies raised in rabbits. Antibodies against phosphothreonine were obtained from New England Biolabs. All antibodies were detected using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL™, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturers instructions. Antibodies were the kind gift of Drs. Peter Nixon, Imperial College of Science, London, UK (NDH-I), Stefan Jansson, University of Umeå, Sweden (Lhca and Lhcb), Hans-Erik Aakerlund and Marie Eskling, Lund, Sweden (zeaxanthin epoxidase and violaxanthin de-epoxidase), Torill Hundal, Linköping University, Sweden (D1), Sabeeha Merchant, University of California, Los Angeles, CA (cytochrome f and CF1), and Krishna Niyogi, University of California, Berkeley, CA (PsbS). All samples for immunoblotting were loaded on a chlorophyll basis in an amount empirically determined to give a linear response. This amount varied between 0.1 and 1.0 μg of Chl depending on the antibody used. Immunoblotting analysis of each thylakoid preparation was repeated 2 or 3 times and the results varied ±5–10%. Low Temperature Fluorescence Measurements—The fluorescence spectra at 77 K were recorded from 650 to 800 nm using an excitation wavelength of 435 nm and a bifurcated light guide connected to the spectrofluorometer. Intact leaves were dark-adapted for 3 min before measurements. NADP-malate Dehydrogenase Assay—Light activation of the chloroplast NADP-malate dehydrogenase was used to monitor the redox state of the acceptor side of PSI. Leaf extraction and NADP-malate dehydrogenase activity measurements were carried out essentially as described by Scheibe and Stitt (32Schreibe R. Stitt M. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1988; 26: 473-481Google Scholar). Plants with 15% PSI-D left and wild-type plants were harvested in liquid nitrogen after 15 min, 2 h, and 4 h of illumination in the growth chamber. Light Reflection and Light Transmission—Light reflection and light transmission through the leaf was determined as described in Lunde et al. (33Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Rosgaard L. Haldrup A. Gilpin M.J. Scheller H.V. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Two Genes psaD1 and psaD2 and the Corresponding Proteins PSI-D1 and PSI-D2 Are Very Similar—The two genes encoding PSI-D are highly homologous and share 87% identity at the DNA level. At the protein level, PSI-D1 and PSI-D2 show 95% identity when the full-length apoproteins are compared, and 98% identity for the mature protein (Fig. 1). Alignment of PSI-D1 and PSI-D2 revealed that the C-terminal region important for the binding of ferredoxin is highly conserved between the two proteins and that the amino acid substitutions and deletions are present in the N-terminal extension unique to eukaryotic PSI-D. Construction of Arabidopsis Plants Lacking PSI-D—The two genes encoding PSI-D share 21 combinations of completely identical stretches of 22 nucleotides. The introduction of psaD2 in antisense orientation was therefore expected to efficiently down-regulate the expression from both genes (34Waterhouse P.M. Wang M.B. Lough T. Nature. 2001; 411: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 35Andersson J. Wentworth M. Walters R. Howard C. Ruban A. Horton P. Jansson S. Plant J. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The original Arabidopsis lines obtained after transformation with the psaD2 construct were selfed, the seeds produced were plated on kanamycin-containing plates, and kanamycin-resistant plants were transferred to compost. Leaf extracts of the T1 plants were analyzed by immunoblotting and various amounts of residual (5–100%) PSI-D could be detected. In 30% of all kanamycin-selected T1 plants, a down-regulation of PSI-D was observed: 25% had 20–60% PSI-D left and 5% had only 5–10% PSI-D left. The detection limit is about 3% of wild-type levels. Transformants grown under normal conditions in soil had a clear phenotype that correlated well with the residual amount of PSI-D (Fig. 2). Plants with 5% PSI-D grew extremely slowly compared with wild-type, but under optimal growth conditions they survived longer than the wild-type because of the impaired growth. Plants with as little as 5% PSI-D left were not able to set seeds, but plants with 20–60% PSI-D eventually set seeds, so several generations could be obtained from these plants. The number of seeds in these plants was, however, highly reduced. The Amount of PSI Is Reduced to the Same Extent as PSI-D—In plants with 30–40% PSI-D left, the P700 per 1000 Chl was 0.46 ± 0.07 compared with 1.70 ± 0.04 for wild-type plants (Table I), which is equivalent to a Chl/P700 ratio of 589 ± 14 and 2192 ± 364, respectively. In agreement with the lower P700 content, plants with 60 and 20% PSI-D also had a decreased Chl a/b ratio of 2.49 ± 0.06 and 2.11 ± 0.27, respectively, whereas in wild-type plants the ratio was 2.65 ± 0.06 (Table I). The amount of PSI-A/B was reduced to the same extent as PSI-D as well as all other PSI subunits (Fig. 3A) and the four Lhca proteins (Fig. 3B). The PSI-E protein was partly degraded indicating proteolytic degradation. Thus, the Arabidopsis plants with 20% PSI-D contain only about 20% of PSI and Arabidopsis plants with 60% PSI-D contain only ∼60% PSI. The remaining PSI appears to contain a full complement of all subunits, including PSI-D. Hence, the antisense PSI-D plants are in fact PSI-reduced plants. The amount of PSII (determined as D1 per chlorophyll) was increased compared with wild-type (Fig. 3D).Table IChlorophyll content (Chl), Chl a/b ratio, and P700/Chl ratio of wild-type (WT), antisense plants with 40% PSI-D left (40% PSI-D) and antisense plants with 20% PSI-D left (20% PSI-D)ChlChl a/bChl/P700P700/Chl* 1000μg cm-2WT20.7 ± 5.82.65 ± 0.06589 ± 141.70 ± 0.0430-40% PSI-D10.7 ± 2.72.49 ± 0.062192 ± 3640.46 ± 0.0710-20% PSI-D11.1 ± 1.42.11 ± 0.27NDaND, not determined.NDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Plants with Low Levels of PSI-D Contain Less Chlorophyll— The leaves from antisense plants with decreased PSI-D were thinner, and showed a paler green pigmentation compared with wild-type leaves. Thus, in plants with 20% PSI-D, the paler appearance reflected a 50% lower chlorophyll content per leaf area (Table I). The transmission and reflection of white light was measured to determine the amount of absorbed light. Wild-type leaves reflected 8 ± 1% of the light, whereas leaves from plants with 40% PSI-D reflected as much as 31 ± 5%. The transmission of light was determined to be 5 ± 1 and 10 ± 1% for wild-type and PSI-D-less plants, respectively. Thus, plants with 40% PSI-D only absorb 59% of incident light and wild-type plants 87%. Antenna Function—Judged on Chl a/b ratio, Chl/P700 ratio, and immunoblotting, the amount of PSI correlates very well with the amount of PSI-D indicating that little, if any, PSI is present, which does not contain all subunits. If this is the case, the present PSI complexes should be fully functional and thereby contain a normal antenna. To test this, we measured 77 K (Fig. 4). When PSI is excited with far-red light, most of the photons are absorbed by long wavelength chlorophylls in LHCI. If the organization of LHCI were changed it would have resulted in a change in the emission spectrum, most likely a blue shift. However, the peak shape and position was identical in plants with low levels of PSI-D and wild-type plants, confirming that the AsD plants are not affected in the organization of the LHCI antenna and that the residual PSI complexes in the plants are fully functional. The decreased magnitude of the 734 nm peak reflects the lower PSI content in the AsD plants. This confirms that the residual PSI complexes in the PSI-D down-regulated plants are fully functional. NPQ Is Increased in the Absence of PSI-D, and the Plastoquinone Pool Is Overreduced—Plants with low amounts of PSI-D exhibited very high NPQ compared with the wild-type (Fig. 5A). NPQ has several components (36Krause G.H. Weis E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 313-349Crossref Scopus (3695) Google Scholar): qE, energy-dependent fluorescence quenching; qT, caused by the state transitions from state 1 to state 2; and finally qI, representing photoinactivation of PSII. Usually, the major component of NPQ is qE-type quenching, which is dependent on the ability to build up a high transthylakoidal ΔpH, a functional xanthophyll cycle, and the presence of PsbS (37Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The increased NPQ indicates that the plants with reduced PSI-D try to avoid photoinhibition by dissipating the excess light energy safely as heat. However, despite the increased NPQ, the plants showed substantial overreduction of the PSII acceptors (determined as 1-qP) even at low and moderate light intensities (Fig. 5B). To determine the extent to which antisense PSI-D plants were able to compensate for the low level of photochemistry by increasing NPQ, the amount of excess energy generated by PSII (29Kato C.M. Hikosaka K. Hirotsu N. Makino A. Hirose T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was calculated (Fig. 5D). The fraction of incoming light absorbed by PSII was estimated from the total amount of light absorbed by the leaves and the PSII/PSI ratio. The PSII/PSI ratio was estimated to be 1.5 and 3.75 in wild-type and asD (40% PSI) plants, respectively (38Walters R.G. Horton P. Planta. 1994; 195: 248-256Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the wild-type plants 52% of the incoming light is absorbed by PSII and in asD plants only 47% of the incoming light is absorbed (wild-type, 0.87–0.60 = 0.52; asD, 0.59–0.79 = 0.47). The asD plants are very sensitive to photoinhibition (Fig. 5B) and above 500 μmol m–2 s–1 the quantum yield of PSII is close to zero (results not shown). The level of excess excitation energy was therefore only calculated in the light range where photochemistry occurs. The plants with low PSI-D show a much higher production of excess excitation energy under low and moderate light intensities and at 100 μmol m–2 s–1, the light intensity to which the plants are adapted, the asD plants have to cope with a 4-fold higher production of excess excitation energy. This clearly shows that the asD plants are unable to up-regulate NPQ sufficiently to compensate for the reduced photochemistry. The Content of Proteins Involved in qE and PSI–Photoinhibition Is Changed in PSI-D-deficient Plants—Immunoblotting was performed to elucidate the changes leading to the significantly increased NPQ. Violaxanthin de-epoxidase converts violaxanthin to zeaxanthin and zeaxanthin epoxidase converts zeaxanthin to violaxanthin. The level of violaxanthin de-epoxidase was up-regulated 200%, whereas the zeaxanthin epoxidase was reduced to 50% of wild-type levels (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the high NPQ was generated by changing the ratio between the two enzymes, thereby shifting the xanthophyll cycle toward producing more zeaxanthin and thereby increasing qE. PsbS is also necessary for qE and was 170% higher in the asD plants. A similar increase was observed for NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH-I), which is an enzyme suggested to be involved in cyclic electron transport. Thus, three major adjustments have occurred that will contribute to the higher level of NPQ. The amount of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 was slightly decreased in plants with reduced levels of PSI-D (Fig. 4B) and the phosphorylation level of LHCII was 480% higher than wild-type levels (Fig. 4C). The amounts of cytochrome f, ATPase, Fd, and Fd:NADP+-oxidoreductase were unchanged compared with wild-type on a chlorophyll basis. However, because the level of PSI was much lower in plants with 20 or 60% PSI-D, the amount per PSI was greatly increased. Plants without PSI-D Exhibit Chronic PSII Photoinhibition—The lower content of PSI in the asD plants leads to over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool and the plants are therefore likely to suffer from PSII photoinhibition. The efficiency of PSII photochemistry is a measure of the functionality of PSII, and plants with low amounts of PSI-D exhibited a decreased ϕPSII even after 16 h of dark adaptation (Fig. 5C, 0 μmol m–2 s–1 photon flux density). In the light, ϕPSII was very low, but ϕPSII in the light is affected by many fact"
https://openalex.org/W2107875803,"Steroid hormone receptors are ligand-stimulated transcription factors that modulate gene transcription by recruiting coregulators to gene promoters. Subcellular localization and dynamic movements of transcription factors have been shown to be one of the major means of regulating their transcriptional activity. In the present report we describe the subcellular localization and the dynamics of intracellular trafficking of steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1). After its synthesis in the cytoplasm, SRC-1 is imported into the nucleus, where it activates transcription and is subsequently exported back to the cytoplasm. In both the nucleus and cytoplasm, SRC-1 is localized in speckles. The characterization of SRC-1 nuclear localization sequence reveals that it is a classic bipartite signal localized in the N-terminal region of the protein, between amino acids 18 and 36. This sequence is highly conserved within the other members of the p160 family. Additionally, SRC-1 nuclear export is inhibited by leptomycin B. The region involved in its nuclear export is localized between amino acids 990 and 1038. It is an unusually large domain differing from the classic leucine-rich NES sequences. Thus SRC-1 nuclear export involves either an alternate type of NES or is dependent on the interaction of SRC-1 with a protein, which is exported through the crm1/exportin pathway.

Available data are still contradictory, and these variations may be attributed to different cell culture conditions, cell differentiation state, and different detection methods (19Wu R.C. Qin J.

The advantage of this approach is to allow in vivo detection of the protein and thus the study of intracellular trafficking dynamics. However, the data obtained with this method need to be substantiated with immunodetection experiments to avoid potential pitfalls due to the fluorescent tag. Indeed, the nature of the fluorescent tag (EGFP, DsRed1, DsRed2, etc.) and its position in the expressed protein (N- or C-terminal) can modify the conformation of the protein and thus interfere with its subcellular localization, trafficking, and transcription function (26Söling A. Simm A. Rainov N.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The present study documents the subcellular localization and the dynamics of intracellular trafficking of the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) as a prototype of nuclear receptors coactivators (27Onate S.A.

This family of coactivators is characterized by the presence of several conserved functional domains: a bHLH-PAS N-terminal domain, a CBP interacting domain (AD1), a glutamine-rich region, a C-terminal activation domain (AD2), and several LXXLL boxes involved in nuclear receptor binding. Isoforms of SRC-1 have been described, SRC-1a and SRC-1e, which differ in their C-terminal region (37Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W.

Presently, the minor amount of information on the subcellular localization of SRC-1 is controversial (20Chen S.L. Wang S.C. Hosking B. Muscat G.E. Mol.

In this report we show that SRC-1 is trafficking between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We postulate that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of SRC-1 has a role in modulating the transcriptional activity of PR in particular and steroid receptors in general, thereby controlling molecular events of hormone action.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids: Nomenclature—Plasmid derivatives denoted with the Δ symbol lack the coactivator segment delineated by the numbered amino acids. Plasmids encoding the wild-type human SRC-1 (pSG5-SRC-1 and pSG5-HA-SRC-1) and deletion mutants (pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(1–567), pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(1–781)) have been previously described (41Chauchereau A. Georgiakaki M. Perrin-Wolff M. Milgrom E. Loosfelt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8540-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Expression vectors pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(1–1198) and pSG5-HA-SRC-Δ(1–177) were obtained by ligation after digestion of pSG5-HA-SRC-1 by NotI/MscI and XmaI/PstI, respectively. Expression vectors pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(216–1440) and pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(784–1440) were obtained after insertion of a stop codon in the 5′HindIII and 5′BamHI sites of pSG5-HA-SRC-1, respectively. PCR was used to generate the expression vector for the SRC-1 mutant pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(785–1038) by inserting a BamH1 site in position 2343 corresponding to the amino acid 782. For the generation of the mutant pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(988–1440) a PCR fragment was prepared containing BamHI/MscI extremities and a stop codon in the position 2962 corresponding to the amino acid 988. For these two constructs, the deletion was obtained by replacing the wild-type fragment BamHI/MscI by the BamHI/MscI-digested PCR fragment. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of pSG5-HA-SRC-1 was used to create deletion mutants: pSG5-HA-Δ(18–36)-SRC-1 (named Δ(NLS)SRC-1 in the text), pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(865–876), pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(948–960), pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(948–969), pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(865–876, 948–960), and pSG5-HA-SRC-1Δ(990–1060). pSG5-HA-GFP-SRC-1 and pSG5-HA-GFP-Δ(NLS)-SRC-1 plasmids were generated by PCR amplification of the EGFP sequence from pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the primers 5′-EGFP (5′-ACTGGCGCGCCTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA-3′) and 3′-EGFP (5′-AGCGCGGCCGCCGGACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCA-3′) to create an EGFP encoding fragment with 5′AscI and 3′NotI sites used for subcloning into pSG5-HA-SRC-1 and pSG5-HA-Δ(NLS)-SRC-1 vectors, respectively. HA-DsRed-PR was generated by PCR amplification of the DsRed1 sequence from pDsRed1-C1 vector (Clontech) using the primers 5′DsRed (5′-ACTGGCGCTAGCATGGTGCGCTCCTCCAAGAA-3′) and 3′DsRed (5′-GATGTCGAATTCGAGCAGGAACAGGTGGTGGC-3′) to create a DsRed1 encoding fragment with 5′NheI and 3′EcoRI sites used for subcloning into pSG5-HA-rPR vector, encoding rabbit progesterone receptor. Each construct was verified by sequencing analysis. PR encoding vector and (PRE)2-TATA-CAT reporter plasmids have been previously described (42Guiochon-Mantel A. Savouret J.F. Quignon F. Delabre K. Milgrom E. de Thé H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1791-1803PubMed Google Scholar). pKSV-PRΔ(25–103, 547–662) expression vector encodes a cytoplasmic PR mutant (named Δ(NLS)PR in the text) and has been previously described (43Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Monoclonal and Polyclonal Anti-SRC-1 Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal and murine monoclonal antibodies were produced against the N-terminal amino acids (1–361) of the human SRC-1 according to a previously described protocol (44Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Two polyclonal antibodies and five monoclonal antibodies (anti-SRC-1 S1 to S5) were generated and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The specificity of antibodies was studied as previously described (44Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), including detection of SRC-1 expressed by transfection of mammalian cells, using Western blot and immunocytochemical techniques. The antibodies generated a very weak signal against the endogenous protein in non-transfected cells. In these studies, we used the higher titer polyclonal antibody (1:4000) and the S4 monoclonal antibody (IgG1K) at the concentration of 5 μg/ml.Cell Culture—COS-7, CV1, HeLa, and L cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen), and supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and antibiotics (Invitrogen). BHK21 cells were grown under the same conditions except for temperature (33 °C) and atmosphere (10% CO2 and 90% air). The generation of mouse L cells stably expressing SRC-1 was performed as described previously (45Guiochon-Mantel A. Lescop P. Christin-Maitre S. Loosfelt H. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For hormonal regulation experiments, cells were grown in the presence of 10% steroid-depleted FCS. Where indicated cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. This concentration suppressed 95% of protein synthesis (46Guiochon-Mantel A. Delabre K. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Proc.

Progesterone (Sigma) and R5020 (17,21-dimethyl-19-norpregna-4,9-dien-3,20-dione) were used at a concentration of 10 nm. Leptomycin B (LMB) was used at a concentration of 40 nm (43Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 49Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). L cell lines permanently expressing pSG5-HA-SRC-1 and pSG5-GFP-SRC-1 were obtained as previously described (45Guiochon-Mantel A. Lescop P. Christin-Maitre S. Loosfelt H. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Cell Cycle—BHK21 cells transfected in duplicate with SRC-1-encoding vector were first maintained for 36 h in isoleucine-deficient minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped and dialyzed FCS to arrest cells in the G1 phase (50Tobey R.A. Ley K.D. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 46: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells were then released from cell cycle arrest and switched to complete DMEM containing 1.5 mm hydroxyurea for 12 h to resynchronize the cells in early S phase (51Tobey R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1973; 6: 67-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For G2 synchrony (52Tobey R.A. Oishi N. Crissman H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5104-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), cells were released from hydroxyurea and cultured in DMEM containing Hoechst 33342 (Calbiochem) at 1.5 μg/ml for 12 h. One set of cells was analyzed by immunochemistry (see below), and another was used for cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Briefly, cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted, and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of ∼106 cells/ml. Two volumes of cold absolute ethanol were added, and the samples were stored at –20 °C until the day of analysis. During analysis, cells were pelleted and resuspended in PBS. These ethanol-fixed cells were incubated in a staining solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase A (Stratagene) in PBS as described previously (53Deitch A.D. Law H. DeVere White R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1982; 30: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cells were analyzed after 1 h of incubation in darkness at 4 °C.Transfection and Analysis of CAT Activity—Transfections of CV1 cells were performed in 6-well dishes by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (41Chauchereau A. Georgiakaki M. Perrin-Wolff M. Milgrom E. Loosfelt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8540-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CAT activity was measured with the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and CAT activity was corrected for protein content. The results are the means ± S.E. of three separate experiments.Immunodetection and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were seeded on glass coverslips placed in 6-well dishes (Costar). Transfections were performed with the indicated expression vectors using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). For GFP-Δ(NLS)-SRC-1/DsRed-PR and Δ(NLS)-PR/HA-SRC-1 cotransport experiments, the corresponding expression plasmids were transfected at a ratio of 1:5. Cells were fixed and processed as previously described (7Guiochon-Mantel A. Loosfelt H. Lescop P. Sar S. Atger M. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. Cell. 1989; 57: 1147-1154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For PR detection, we used the Mi60 monoclonal antibody (54Logeat F. Vu Hai M.T. Fournier A. Legrain P. Buttin G. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6456-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 8 μg/ml. Rat monoclonal anti-HA epitope antibody 3F10 (Roche Diagnostic) was used at 2 μg/ml. All secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:400. The conjugated secondary antibodies goat Alexa 488, goat Alexa 546, and goat Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes) and sheep Cy3 (Sigma) were used to detect anti-PR Mi60 monoclonal, anti-SRC-1 polyclonal, anti-HA (3F10) monoclonal, and anti-SRC-1 (S4) monoclonal antibodies, respectively. In some experiments, a nucleic acid marker was added during secondary antibody incubation (SYTOX Green, Molecular Probes) at 200 nm.The subcellular localization of the coactivator was scored in at least 100 cells under each experimental condition. Staining was considered as nuclear when it was exclusively nuclear (N) or stronger in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (N > C). In all other cases, it was considered cytoplasmic (if C = N, if C > N and if C). Fluorescent cells were observed and scanned with the LSM410 system (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) assembled on an inverted microscope Axiovert 135M. Digitalized pictures were analyzed by Zeiss LSM application.RESULTSSRC-1 Is Localized in Both the Cytoplasm and the Nucleus— We transfected COS-7 cells with an expression vector encoding SRC-1 to examine its subcellular distribution. Immunocytochemical detection (40 h post-transfection) using a specific anti-SRC-1 antibody showed the protein to be present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in about 50% of cells (Fig. 1, a–c). In the other cells, labeling was restricted either to the nucleus or to the cytoplasm. In both compartments, SRC-1 was associated with corpuscular structures. Localization of transcriptional regulators in nuclear speckles has previously been described, but the presence of similar structures in the cytoplasm is an unusual observation (55Baumann C.T. Ma H. Wolford R. Reyes J.C. Maruvada P. Lim C. Yen P.M. Stallcup M.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 485-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 56Wu X. Li H. Park E.J. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24177-24185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some detection techniques have been shown to produce artifactual data. Thus, we examined the possibility that our observation might be an artifact due to fixation, immunocytochemistry, or transfection. Identical localization of SRC-1 was observed even when we varied the fixation methods (ethanol, paraformaldehyde, and methanol), antibodies (monoclonal or polyclonal anti-SRC-1 antibodies, anti-HA antibody detection of a HA-SRC-1 construct), cell types (CV1, L, SW13, and C33), and transfection methods (calcium phosphate and LipofectAMINE). The same pattern of localization was also observed in living cells after transfection with GFP-SRC-1 (Fig. 1b). The possibility that overexpression of the protein might be responsible for this pattern has also been considered. However, by varying the amount of the vector (from 1 to 2000 ng), we did not observe difference in the localization of SRC-1 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were also observed with established L cell lines permanently expressing either SRC-1 or GFP-SRC-1 fusion protein (Fig. 2B, panel a).Fig. 2SRC-1 subcellular localization is not affected by its expression level. A, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with different amounts of vector encoding SRC-1: 1 ng (a), 5 ng (b), 100 ng (c), 500 ng (d), and 2000 ng (e). Forty hours post-transfection, the cells were fixed, treated for immunodetection with anti-SRC-1 antibody, and observed by confocal microscopy. Bar, 5 μm. B, L cells were fixed, treated for immunodetection, and observed by confocal microscopy. a, L cells permanently expressing SRC-1 were analyzed by immunofluorescence with anti-SRC-1 antibody. b, L cells were treated for immunodetection with a non-specific antibody. c, L cells were treated for immunodetection with anti-SRC-1 antibody. SRC-1 can be either nuclear or nuclear and cytoplasmic in different cells. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Detection of endogenous SRC-1 in non-transfected cells was at the limit of sensitivity of the immunocytochemical method. Diffuse nucleocytoplasmic labeling was observed (Fig. 2B, panel c). Thus, based on our observations, SRC-1 localizes either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm or in both compartments in different cells.Nuclear Cytoplasmic Trafficking of SRC-1—We next tried to understand the heterogeneous localization of SRC-1. One possibility was that SRC-1 localization varied in a cell cycle phase-dependent manner. BHK21 cells were transfected with an SRC-1 expression vector and arrested at different stages of the cell cycle (G1, S, and G2/M). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of the arrested cells failed to demonstrate a correlation between SRC-1 subcellular localization and cell cycle phase (Fig. 3).Fig. 3SRC-1 subcellular localization is not modified during the cell cycle. BHK21 cells transfected with SRC-1 encoding vector were synchronized in G1 and cultured in defined conditions to observe the different cell cycle phases as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell cycle phases were determined by cytofluorimetry (G1, early S, and G2). At each point, the subcellular localization of SRC-1 was scored by immunodetection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nuclear labeling: open bars. Cytoplasmic labeling: closed bars. The results are means ± S.D. of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Another possible explanation for the heterogeneity of immunolabeling of SRC-1 was that it reflected a dynamic situation, the protein being localized initially in one of the cellular compartments and secondarily moving to the other. We could thus observe cells at different stages of such a cycle. To investigate this possibility, we transfected COS-7 cells with SRC-1 expression vector and fixed the cells at different time points after transfection (Fig. 4). A short time after transfection (13 h), SRC-1 was exclusively nuclear and concentrated into speckles. With increasing time following transfection (20, 26, and 32 h), a growing proportion of cells with primarily cytoplasmic labeling of SRC-1 was observed (14, 22, and 64%, respectively). Forty hours after transfection, SRC-1 was mostly located in cytoplasmic speckles (78% of cells) (Fig. 4c).Fig. 4SRC-1 initially localizes in the"
https://openalex.org/W1980564886,"The crystal structure of rat heme oxygenase-1 in complex with biliverdin-iron chelate (biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1), the immediate precursor of the final product, biliverdin, has been determined at a 2.4-Å resolution. The electron density in the heme pocket clearly showed that the tetrapyrrole ring of heme is cleaved at the α-meso edge. Like the heme bound to HO-1, biliverdin-iron chelate is located between the distal and proximal helices, but its accommodation state seems to be less stable in light of the disordering of the solvent-exposed propionate and vinyl groups. The middle of the distal helix is shifted away from the center of the active site in biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1, increasing the size of the heme pocket. The hydrogen-bonding interaction between Glu-29 and Gln-38, considered to restrain the orientation of the proximal helix in the heme-HO-1 complex, was lost in biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1, leading to relaxation of the helix. Biliverdin has a distorted helical conformation; the lactam oxygen atom of its pyrrole ring-A interacted with Asp-140 through a hydrogen-bonding solvent network. Because of the absence of a distal water ligand, the iron atom is five-coordinated with His-25 and four pyrrole nitrogen atoms. The coordination geometry deviates considerably from a square pyramid, suggesting that the iron may be readily dissociated. We speculate that the opened conformation of the heme pocket facilitates sequential product release, first iron then biliverdin, and that because of biliverdin's increased flexibility, iron release triggers its slow dissociation.

We speculate that the opened conformation of the heme pocket facilitates sequential product release, first iron then biliverdin, and that because of biliverdin's increased flexibility, iron release triggers its slow dissociation. Heme oxygenase (HO) 1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; biliverdin(Fe), biliverdin IXα-iron chelate; biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1, HO-1 in complex with biliverdin(Fe); heme-HO-1, HO-1 in complex with heme; CN–-heme-HO-1, heme-HO-1 bound to cyanide; N3–-heme-HO-1, heme-HO-1 bound to azide; OEB, octaethylbilindione.1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; biliverdin(Fe), biliverdin IXα-iron chelate; biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1, HO-1 in complex with biliverdin(Fe); heme-HO-1, HO-1 in complex with heme; CN–-heme-HO-1, heme-HO-1 bound to cyanide; N3–-heme-HO-1, heme-HO-1 bound to azide; OEB, octaethylbilindione. catalyzes the oxygen-dependent degradation of heme to biliverdin IXα, iron, and carbon monoxide using reducing equivalents. In higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, HO functions in the biosynthesis of such open-chain tetrapyrroles as phytochrome chromophore and phycobilin (1Beale S.I. Ciba Found. Symp. 1994; 180: 156-168PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in certain pathogenic bacteria, HO is used for iron uptake from heme obtained from the host (2Schmitt M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5330-5340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in mammals, HO has a key function in physiological heme metabolism (3Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of HO, HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3, are present in mammals. HO-1 (32 kDa) is highly expressed in spleen and liver and inducible by various substances including heme itself. This isoform is considered mainly to function in heme catabolism. In addition, HO-1 is involved in the defense against oxidative stress because it is induced by various oxidative stresses, removes the heme, pro-oxidant, and produces the antioxidants, biliverdin and bilirubin (4Ryter S.W. Tyrrell R.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). In contrast, HO-2 (36 kDa) is expressed constitutively in the brain, testis, and the vascular systems. The principal role of HO-2 is speculated to be the production of CO as a neurotransmitter (5Barañano D.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10996-11002Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), but the role of CO as a signal agent is controversial (6Cary S.P. Marletta M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1071-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HO-3 also catalyzes heme degradation, but its function in vivo has yet to be determined (7McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 8Scapagnini G. D'Agata V. Calabrese V. Pascale A. Colombrita C. Alkon D. Cavallaro S. Brain Res. 2002; 954: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The reaction pathway of vertebrate HO consists of three sequential oxidation steps that utilize O2 and the reducing equivalents from NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (9Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4418-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Wilks A. Sykes A.G. Advances in Inorganic Chemistry. Vol. 51. Academic Press, San Diego.2001: 359-407Google Scholar). In the first step, O2 bound to the heme iron is activated to hydroperoxide, and electrophilic addition of its terminal oxygen to the α-meso carbon produces α-hydroxyheme. In the second step, α-hydroxyheme is converted to verdoheme with concomitant release of the α-meso carbon as CO (11Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. Sano S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Last, the oxygen bridge of verdoheme is cleaved to produce biliverdin-iron chelate (biliverdin(Fe)). Iron is released before the dissociation of biliverdin (12Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these reaction steps, heme acts as both substrate and cofactor. The crystal structures of the human, rat, and Neisseria meningitidis HO complexes with heme show that all HOs have similar overall structures, consisting mainly of α-helices (13Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11552-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the structure of rat HO-1 in complex with heme (heme-HO-1), the protein moiety consists of eight helices, A through H. The heme is sandwiched between the proximal helix, A (Leu-13∼Glu-29), and the distal kinked helix, F (Leu-129∼Met-155). The His-25 side-chain in the A helix contributes the proximal heme ligand, whereas H2O or OH– serves as the distal ligand. No dissociable residue is present on the distal side of the heme, but backbones of Gly-139 and Gly-143 in the F helix are close enough to form hydrogen-bonds with the distal ligand. We have reported that in the absence of heme, the proximal helix is disordered and the distal helix relaxed, and we proposed an induced-fitting model for the accommodation of heme into the heme pocket of HO (16Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Kakuta Y. Omata Y. Hayashi S. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7293-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, we determined the structure of the azide-bound form of rat heme-HO-1 (N3–-heme-HO-1) as an analog of the dioxygen-bound form and showed that the azide bound to the heme iron is nearly parallel to the heme plane and points toward the α-meso carbon of the heme (17Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Higashimoto Y. Omata Y. Hayashi S. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45086-45090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We also proposed that not only the amide group of Gly-143 but also the hydrogen-bonding network at the distal heme pocket has a crucial role in the formation of ferric hydroperoxide, the activated oxygen species for the α-meso hydroxylation step of the HO reaction (17Sugishima M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45086-45090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Although major progress has been made in understanding the nature of the first hydroxylation of heme, the mechanisms for the subsequent steps are still not clear. In the second step, whether the ferric α-hydroxyheme requires an electron before reacting with O2 to yield verdoheme remains unsettled (18Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K.

Noguchi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5231-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Yoshida T. Noguchi M. J. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but little is known about the mechanism whereby biliverdin is produced from verdoheme and finally released from the enzyme. For further investigation of the HO reaction mechanism, enzyme structures with heme degradation intermediates have been awaited with much interest. Herein we report the crystal structure of rat HO-1 in complex with biliverdin-iron chelate (biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1) at 2.4 Å resolution. This is the first report of the structure of biliverdin(Fe) in complex with protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of the Biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 Crystal—Truncated rat HO-1 (Met-1∼Pro-267) was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (17Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Higashimoto Y. Omata Y. Hayashi S. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45086-45090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and CN–-heme-HO-1 crystals were prepared (45Sugishima, M., Sakamoto, H., Noguchi, M., and Fukuyama, K. (2003) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). Biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 crystals were prepared by soaking CN–-heme-HO-1 crystals in a solution of 4 m sodium formate and 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, with 100 mm sodium ascorbate as the reducing agent, until the crystal color changed to green (about 3 h). A small crystal (50 μm wide) was used for the data collection because large crystals (more than 100 μm wide) were apt to crack or dissolve during preparation.Data Collection and Processing—The biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 crystal was held in a cryo-loop and flash-cooled in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation (λ = 1.000 Å) at the beamline BL41XU of SPring-8 and a MarCCD system. The crystal-to-CCD distance was 130 mm. The crystal was oscillated 1.5° with an exposure time of 40 s per frame; the total measurement angle was 120°. Diffraction data were processed, merged, and scaled with MOSFLM (25Steller I. Bolotovsky R. Rossmann M.G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1036-1040Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and SCALA (26The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein CrystallographyActa Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab Model Building and Refinement—Because the biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 crystal was isomorphous with the CN–-heme-HO-1 crystal, the structure of biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 was determined using the structure of the protein moiety of CN–-heme-HO-1 (45Sugishima, M., Sakamoto, H., Noguchi, M., and Fukuyama, K. (2003) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). Rigid-body, simulated annealing, and temperature-factor refinements were applied to the model using the 50.0–2.4-Å resolution data. XtalView (28McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) was used to revise the structure. In this step, the cleaved tetrapyrrole ring was clearly visible in the electron density map. After one cycle of water picking and conjugate gradient energy minimization refinement, an additional electron density appeared around the N-terminal residue (Gln-11), to which the model from Ser-7 to Ser-10 was fitted. After one cycle of water picking, conjugate gradient energy minimization, and temperature-factor refinements, the model of biliverdin(Fe) moiety was fitted to the σA weighted F o–F c map in the heme pocket. Last, conjugate gradient energy minimization and temperature-factor refinements were applied to the model, including biliverdin(Fe). Neither the torsion angles of the tetrapyrrole rings in the biliverdin(Fe) moiety nor the coordination bonds to the heme iron were restrained in the refinements. All refinements were done with CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). The stereo-chemical check of the model was carried out with PROCHECK (26The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein CrystallographyActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar, 30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are given in Table I.RESULTSProtein Structure—The structure of biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 was refined using 2.4-Å resolution data to the R factor of 0.194 and the free R factor of 0.239. Six residues at the N terminus and 46 residues at the C terminus are disordered in the biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 crystal. Main-chain atoms from Ser-7 to Met-9 were ordered compared with heme-HO-1, but the side-chain of Met-9 was disordered. The structure of biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 consists of eight helices, A through H (Fig. 1a), and is similar to that of heme-HO-1 (13Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11552-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b), and the root-mean-square deviation for Cα atoms was 0.26 Å. The biliverdin(Fe) is wedged between A and F helices at a position corresponding to the heme in heme-HO-1 (14Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The plot of the deviations of Cα atoms between biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 and heme-HO-1 (Fig. 1c, solid line) shows that residues with a large deviation (>0.8 Å) are localized in the middle of the F-helix and in the FG and GH loops. These two loops are located on the molecular surface and can easily adopt different conformations depending on the crystal packing force. Indeed, the structures of heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1 (17Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Higashimoto Y. Omata Y. Hayashi S. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45086-45090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), although determined from different space groups, differ in the conformation of these two loops, but the rest of their structures are similar. In particular, the heme pocket structure and positions of the water molecules involved in the distal hydrogen-bonding network, considered essential for catalysis (31Lightning L.K. Huang H.

Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), are well conserved (14Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Kakuta Y. Omata Y. Hayashi S. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7293-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The plot of the deviations for the Cα atoms between biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1 (Fig. 1c, dashed line) (both isomorphous crystals) shows a large deviation only in the middle of the F-helix. Therefore, essential structural differences between the substrate (heme)- and product (biliverdin(Fe))-bound forms are chiefly restricted to the middle of the F-helix.Distal Helix—The F-helix of biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 was bent (∼50°) at Leu-141 and Ser-142, as in heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1, but the middle of the helix, Gly-143 to Gln-145, was shifted away from the heme pocket compared with that in heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1. The distance between Gly-143 N and the iron atom was elongated by 0.9 Å in biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 compared with that in heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1, whereas the distance between Gly-139 O and the iron atom showed no change in the three structures (Table II). Notably, in biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1, the amide group of Gly-143 was directed toward the carbonyl group of Gly-139, forming an α-helical hydrogen-bond (2.9 Å). The backbones of Gly-144 and Asp-140 were also hydrogen-bonded (2.8 Å) (Fig. 2, left). In N3–-heme-HO-1, however, the amide group of Gly-143 is pointed toward the distal ligand, forming a hydrogen-bond (2.8 Å), and the amide group of Gly-144 and the carbonyl group of Gly-139 face each other at a distance suitable for hydrogen-bonding (3.0 Å). Moreover, the distance between Gly-144 N and Asp-140 O (3.8 Å) is too great to form a hydrogen-bond (Fig. 2, right). This unique conformation is also observed in heme-HO-1 (14Sugishima M. Omata Y. Kakuta Y. Sakamoto H. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).Table IISelected distances of atoms at the distal heme pocketGly-139 O-FeGly-143 N-FeGly-139 O-Gly-143 NGly-139 O-Gly-144 NAsp-140 O-Gly-144 NÅRatBiliverdin(Fe)-HO-14.95.22.93.82.8Heme-HO-15.14.33.12.93.8N3--heme-HO-15.04.33.23.03.8HumanHeme-HO-1 (closed form)4.85.33.24.33.1Heme-HO-1 (opened form)4.96.03.14.82.9 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Comparison of the heme pocket structures of biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1.

In heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1, all the residues examined fell within the region for a right-handed α-helical conformation except Leu-141 ((ϕ, ψ) = (–89°, 6°) in heme-HO-1, (ϕ, ψ) = (–87°, 4°) in N3–-heme-HO-1) and Ser-142 ((ϕ, ψ) = (–120°, –90°) in heme-HO-1, (ϕ, ψ) = (–123°, –98°) in N3–-heme-HO-1); the former was on the periphery of the α-helical region and the latter was outside of the region. Leu-141 ((ϕ, ψ) = (–74°, –12°)) in biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 was also on the periphery of the region, but the dihedral angles of Ser-142 ((ϕ, ψ) = (–98°, –58°)) deviated less from the α-helical region compared with those in heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1. Furthermore, the dihedral angles of the following Gly-143 ((ϕ, ψ) = (–101°, 14°)) differed distinctly from those of heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1 ((ϕ, ψ) = (–71°, –25°) in heme-HO-1, (ϕ, ψ) = (–60°, –28°) in N3–-heme-HO-1). The dihedral angles of the other biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 residues were similar to those in heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1. That is, the deviations of the dihedral angles between the heme and biliverdin(Fe) complexes with HO are limited to two consecutive amino acid residues, Ser-142 and Gly-143. Thus, the conformational change in the backbone at these residues in biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 caused the outward shift of F-helix from the heme pocket after this kink and also brings about rearrangement of the hydrogen-bonds in the kinked region.Fig. 3Ramachandran plot for residues around the kinked point of the distal helix. Plots of Leu-138 through Val-146 residues are joined within the corresponding residues of heme-HO-1 (▪, Protein Data Bank code 1DVE), N3–-heme-HO-1 (•, Protein Data Bank code 1IVJ), and biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 (▴). Leu-141, Ser-142, and Gly-143 are shown in black, the other residues in gray.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Proximal Helix—The proximal helix of biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 is shifted slightly away from the heme pocket compared with the helices in heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1. The His-25 ligand of biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 maintains a conformation similar to those of heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1, and the distance between the iron chelated by biliverdin and Nϵ of His-25 (2.4 Å) is roughly comparable with the corresponding distances in heme-HO-1 (2.3 Å) and N3–-heme-HO-1 (2.1 Å) (Fig. 2). In heme-HO-1 and N3–-heme-HO-1, the amide side chain of Gln-38 of the B-helix is close enough to form a hydrogen-bond with the carbonyl group of the backbone of Glu-29 in the A-helix (2.9 Å in heme-HO-1, 2.7 Å in N3–-heme-HO-1), which indicates that it contributes to fixing the two helices on the proximal side of the heme. In biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1, however, the side-chain of Gln-38 is no longer hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain of Glu-29 (distance between Gln-38 Nϵ and Glu-29 O is 4.4 Å) and has moved closer to the pyrrole ring-A of biliverdin(Fe). A similar conformational change in the side chain of Gln-38 occurs in apo-HO (16Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Kakuta Y. Omata Y. Hayashi S. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7293-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Biliverdin-Iron Chelate Structure—The wire-frame model around the heme pocket of biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 is shown in Fig. 4. The F o –F c map was clearly assignable to the electron density of biliverdin(Fe), consistent with the fact that heme cleavage occurs at the α-meso carbon. One propionate group of the biliverdin(Fe) adopted the same conformation as that of the heme in heme-HO-1 and was buried in the heme pocket, whereas the other group, which is exposed to the solvent in heme-HO-1, was disordered. The vinyl group of pyrrole ring-A, which is also exposed to solvent in heme-HO-1, was not visible. In addition, the temperature factors for the atoms of ring A are higher than those for the atoms of the other three rings. Taking into account that all four pyrrole rings of the heme in heme-HO-1 have similar temperature factors, the biliverdin(Fe) in biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 seems to be accommodated less tightly in the heme pocket than the heme in heme-HO-1. Biliverdin was in helical conformation with the lactam oxygen atoms of ring A and ring B that point upward and downward, respectively. By nature, biliverdin assumes a helical structure to avoid collision with the lactam oxygen atoms. The helical pitch of the biliverdin in biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1, defined as the distance between the two oxygen atoms, was 3.4 Å, comparable with that (3.34 Å) in the crystal structure of biliverdin dimethyl ester (34Sheldrick W.S.

Each OEB molecule in {FeIII(OEB)}2 has the analogous helical pitch of 3.22 Å, but relatively shorter helical pitches have been reported in biliverdin crystallized with proteins (e.g. for apomyoglobin (36Wagner U.G.

The iron atom in biliverdin(Fe) has no distal ligand, unlike the heme iron of heme-HO-1, the distal ligand of which is a water molecule or hydroxide. The coordination geometry to the iron atom is shown in Fig. 5. The distances between the iron atom and the nitrogen atoms of the four pyrrole rings vary considerably, from 2.0 to 2.3 Å, as do the coordination angles of the four nitrogen atoms about the Fe-Nϵ axis (NA-Fe-Nϵ; 91.4°, NB-Nϵ-Fe angle; 130.9°, NC-Fe-Nϵ; 84.5°, ND-Fe-Nϵ; 96.3°). This asymmetry of the iron coordination reflects the distorted helical structure of the biliverdin in biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1; the exposed ring A deviates markedly from the mean plane through the biliverdin(Fe) molecule to the distal side, whereas the buried ring B is shifted slightly from the plane to the proximal side.Fig. 4Electron density of biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1 around the hemepocket. σA-weighted 2F o –F c map contoured at 1.2σ (cyan) superimposed on the wire-frame model of biliverdin(Fe)-HO-1.

Glia maturation factor-β (GMF-β), a 17-kDa brain-specific protein originally purified as a neurotrophic factor from brain, was induced in renal proximal tubular (PT) cells by proteinuria. To examine the role of GMF-β in PT cells, we constructed PT cell lines continuously expressing GMF-β. The PT cells overexpressing GMF-β acquired susceptibility to cell death upon stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α and angiotensin II, both of which are reported to cause oxidative stress. GMF-β overexpression also promoted oxidative insults by H2O2, leading to the reorganization of F-actin as well as apoptosis in non-brain cells (not only PT cells, but also NIH 3T3 cells). The measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species in the GMF-β-overexpressing cells showed a sustained increase in H2O2 in response to tumor necrosis factor-α, angiotensin II, and H2O2 stimuli. The sustained increase in H2O2 was caused by an increase in the activity of the H2O2-producing enzyme copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase, a decrease in the activities of the H2O2-reducing enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase, and a depletion of the content of the cellular glutathione peroxidase substrate GSH. The p38 pathway was significantly involved in the sustained oxidative stress to the cells. Taken together, the alteration of the antioxidant enzyme activities, in particular the peroxide-scavenging deficit, underlies the susceptibility to cell death in GMF-β-overexpressing cells. In conclusion, we suggest that the proteinuria induction of GMF-β in renal PT cells may play a critical role in the progression of renal diseases by enhancing oxidative injuries.

In chronic nephropathies, proteinuria is reportedly one of the best predictors, independent of mean arterial blood pressure, for disease progression toward end-stage renal failure (1Ruggenenti P.

Microalbuminuria, which features a small quantity of albumin only (30–300 mg/24 h), is known as an important early sign of diabetic nephropathy (3Mogensen C.E. N. Engl. J.

These results strongly suggest that altering the disposition of PT cells by proteinuria must be involved in the process of renal damage. However, the mechanisms by which proteinuria accelerates renal disease progression remain largely unknown. We recently found that the brain-specific glia maturation factor-β (GMF-β) gene is induced in PT cells by proteinuria by comparison of the gene expression profiles (8Okubo K. Hori N. Matoba R.

GMF-β is a 17-kDa brain-specific protein that was isolated from bovine brain homogenate as a substance inducing the maturation of normal neurons as well as glial cells (12Lim R. Hicklin D.J. Ryken T.C. Miller J.F. Brain Res. 1987; 430: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Lim R. Hicklin D.J. Miller J.F. Williams T.H. Crabtree J.B. Brain Res. 1987; 430: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); and at first, it was considered to be a neurotrophic factor. However, later intensive researches provided cumulative evidence that GMF-β is involved in cell signal transduction. This evidence comprised the following findings. 1) The GMF-β protein lacks a leader sequence and is not secreted by cells (14Kaplan R. Zaheer A. Jaye M. Lim R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 2) It contains consensus phosphorylation sites and is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, protein kinase A, casein kinase II, and ribosomal S6 kinase in in vitro studies (15Lim R. Zaheer A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Zaheer A. Lim R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5183-5186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 3) GMF-β inhibits the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 and enhances p38 activity (17Lim R. Zaheer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22953-22956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 4) Overexpressed GMF-β in primary astrocytes causes secretion of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor through activation of the p38 pathway (18Zaheer A. Yorek M.A. Lim R. Neurochem. Res. 2001; 26: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of GMF-β is highly conserved among many species (19Zaheer A. Fink B.D. Lim R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that it plays basic roles across many species. The expression of GMF-β is largely limited to the brain (19Zaheer A. Fink B.D. Lim R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), especially the glial cells and some neurons (20Wang B.R. Zaheer A. Lim R. Brain Res. 1992; 591: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Schwann cells of the distal segment of the transected nerve express GMF-β, and this induction of GMF-β coincides with the temporal expression of nerve growth factor receptors in the cells (21Bosch E.P. Zhong W. Lim R. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that GMF-β may play a protective role in the brain. However, its precise function in neurons and glial cells is still largely a matter of speculation. It was thus of interest to determine what impact could be served by the induction of the brain-specific protein GMF-β in PT cells by proteinuria. In this study, we demonstrate that proteinuria induced GMF-β in PT cells in a time-dependent manner. Overexpression of GMF-β in a mouse PT cell line and NIH 3T3 cell lines resulted in susceptibility to cell death upon stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), angiotensin II, and other oxidative stress-inducing agents (buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and H2O2). Further studies clarified that GMF-β overexpression caused enhancement of oxidative injury, leading to F-actin reorganization and apoptosis under oxidative stress. We demonstrate that GMF-β-overexpressing cells, as a mechanism of the vulnerability to oxidative stress, caused a prolonged increase in H2O2 through changes in several antioxidant enzyme activities and that p38 was significantly involved in this process. These results suggest that the induction of the brain-specific GMF-β gene in the kidney may play a key role in renal disease progression caused by proteinuria. Protein-overloaded Proteinuria Murine Model—Five-week-old C57BL6 male and female mice weighing ∼20 g were intraperitoneally given bovine serum albumin (10 mg/g of weight; Sigma) dissolved in saline for 5 days during a 1-week period. The final dose of 10 mg/g of weight was reached by incremental increases in the dose over the first week, beginning with 2.5 mg/g of weight. Control mice were treated with saline (7Zoja C. Benigni A. Remuzzi G. Exp. Nephrol. 1999; 7: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Nakajima H. Takenaka M. Kaimori J.-y. Nagasawa Y. Kosugi A. Kawamoto S. Imai E. Hori M. Okubo K. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 1577-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The load of bovine serum albumin was continued to 4 weeks. At 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, 24 h after loading of bovine serum albumin, kidneys were removed for investigations. Tissue Preparation and Laser Capture Microdissection—The protein-overloaded proteinuria model mice were separated into three random groups. After 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks of loading of bovine serum albumin, kidneys from the first group (n = three each) were removed after perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for Northern blot analysis, and those from the second group (n = one each) after perfusion first with PBS and then with 4% paraformaldehyde. They were made into specimens with the paraffin sectioning method after paraformaldehyde fixation and used for in situ hybridization. Kidneys from the third group (n = three each) were removed after perfusion first with PBS and then with 99.5% ethanol. Kidney tissue sections were prepared and subjected to laser microdissection using an LM200 Image Archiving workstation (Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, CA) along with real-time PCR as described (25Nagasawa Y. Takenaka M. Matsuoka Y. Imai E. Hori M. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Kaimori J.-y. Takenaka M. Nagasawa Y. Nakajima H. Izumi M. Akagi Y. Imai E. Hori M. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2002; 39: 948-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from samples attached to LCM transfer film using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with SuperScript™ II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitation of GMF-β mRNA/rRNA was performed with this real-time PCR system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GMF-β TaqMan probe was 5′-TGGTTTCAGTCTCTGCTAGTTCATACCGCA-3′. The GMF-β forward primer sequence was 5′-GAGGCTTGAAACATTGGTGGTT-3′, and its reverse primer sequence was 5′-CAAGCACCATGCTTACCAAAAG-3′. The rRNA TaqMan probe and the forward and reverse primers were obtained from TaqMan rRNA control reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from mouse kidney was extracted with TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of the RNAs were fractionated on formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences), and subjected to Northern analyses. For the probes, we used the mouse GMF-β sequences (bp 3080–4130) obtained from the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank (accession number AF297220). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was used as an internal control. In Situ Hybridization—GMF-β was subjected to in situ hybridization with the DNA nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GMF-β sense and antisense cRNA probes were prepared by PCReaction. The primers for PCR were 5′-GTCGCAGTAGAGTGGAGTGTGTTG-3′ and 5′-CAGGTCAGGGCCATTCACTCTATG-3′. The PCR product was then subcloned into pST-Blue-1, and the sequence was confirmed to be identical to that of mouse GMF-β (data not shown). The clone was digested by XhoI to produce the template of the antisense probe and by BamHI to produce that of the sense probe. The digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense cRNA probes were generated using 1 μg of template and T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase, respectively, in combination with the digoxigenin RNA labeling mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell Culture and Transfection—The mouse renal proximal tubular cell line mProx24 (60Yamanouchi, M., Honda, A., Uchida, M., Kimura, K., and Sugaya, T. (October 11, 2000) International Patent WO0073791Google Scholar) and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The mProx24 cells were maintained in 0.1% gelatin-coated culture dishes. The mouse GMF-β coding region was amplified by PCR using forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCCGCTGACGACCGGAAGGAAAATGAGTGAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGGGATCCCGCCAGTACCCAGGAGTGGTCAGAGGAGG-3′, cut with BamHI, and inserted into the BglII site of FLAG-linked pCMV-Taq1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Permanent transfection of cells with mammalian expression vectors was achieved with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS and 200 μg/ml Geneticin (G418, Sigma). Immunoblotting—Total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). FLAG-GMF-β was detected using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) at a 5000:1 dilution. The blots were probed with individual primary antibodies as described above and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against mouse GMF-β (the amino acid sequence of the epitope polypeptide was NH2-YQHDDGRVSYPLC-COOH) and confirmed by immunoblotting to bind specifically the GMF-β protein band. Anti-CuZn-SOD and anti-Mn-SOD antibodies were purchased from Stressgen Biotech Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability for mouse PT and NIH 3T3 cells was determined 84 and 48 h, respectively, after treatments by the addition of the tetrazolium compound 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) (inner salt; Promega) (27Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). The MTS tetrazolium compound is bioreduced by cells into a colored formation product that is soluble in culture medium. The solution of MTS mixed with the electron-coupling reagent phenazine methosulfate was added directly to the culture wells and incubated for 1 h, after which absorbance at 490 nm was recorded with a 96-well plate reader. Mouse TNF-α, angiotensin II, H2O2, and BSO were purchased from Sigma (Sigma). Lactate Dehydrogenase Release Assay—The results obtained in the MTS assay were confirmed in a lactate dehydrogenase release assay. A cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to quantitate cytotoxicity/cytolysis based on the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity released from damaged cells. The lactate dehydrogenase activities in the culture supernatants of mProx24 and NIH 3T3 cells were determined 48 and 24 h, respectively, after treatments according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of Apoptotic Cells by Annexin V Flow Cytometer Analysis— Detection of apoptotic cells was performed with an annexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein apoptosis detection kit (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). The assay takes advantage of the properties of binding of annexin V to membrane phosphatidylserine, which is translocated from the inner face of the plasma membrane to the apoptotic cell surface to make early detection of apoptosis by flow cytometry possible. After the addition of H2O2 following one overnight FCS starvation, mProx24 cells were gently trypsinized and washed once with 10% FCS-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before incubation with annexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein at room temperature for 5 min in the dark. The analysis of annexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein binding was performed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometry (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm; BD Biosciences) using a fluorescein isothiocyanate signal detector. Activities of Caspase-3—Caspase-3 activities were detected using a colorimetric assay kit (Promega). Ac-DEVD-p-nitroaniline was used as the substrate for caspase-3. p-Nitroaniline was released from the substrate after cleavage with the DEVDase caspase-3. Free p-nitroaniline produced a yellow color that was monitored with a Emax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 405 nm. After this treatment, the adherent mProx24 cells, both the stable transfectants and wild-type cells, were scraped off and washed with PBS by centrifugation. The cells were then resuspended in hypotonic cell lysis buffer (5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The cells were finally centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used as samples for caspase assay. The protein contents of the same supernatants were assayed with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (50 μm) was included in the caspase-3 assay kit. Detection of Nucleosomal Ladders in Apoptotic Cells—DNA was extracted using the DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen). To detect nucleosomal ladders for apoptotic cells, the PCR-based amplification kit for DNA ladders (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Staining of F-actin and Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Before the various treatments, dish-cultured cells were transferred to 0.1% gelatin-coated coverslips. After 24 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were starved in serum-free medium for 12 h, after which they were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeated with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS (pH 7.5). F-actin was detected using 0.165 μm TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). The cells were examined by confocal microscopy using a Radiance 2100 BLD (Bio-Rad). Determination of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production in PT Cells—Intracellular ROS generation was assessed using the oxidant-sensitive dye 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) (Lambda Fluoreszenztechnologie, Graz, Austria) (28Su B. Mitra S. Gregg H. Flavahan S. Chotani M.A. Clark K.R. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Flavahan N.A. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in wild-type PT cells and those stably overexpressing GMF-β. One of the ROS, intracellular H2O2, could be assayed (29Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PT cells were treated with 5 μg/ml DCFDA for 30 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (118.3 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25.0 mm NaHCO3, and 11.1 mm glucose). After DCFDA incubation, the attached PT cells were cooled and harvested by trypsinization at 4 °C, followed by flow cytometry analysis using a FACSCalibur. To examine the influence of intracellular esterase and probe efflux on the DCFDA assay, the oxidant-insensitive fluorescein diacetate derivative carboxyfluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used at 10 μm. The assay method using carboxyfluorescein diacetate was the same as that using DCFDA. SOD Activity Assay—SOD activity was measured as described by Sutherland and Learmonth (30Sutherland M.W. Learmonth B.A. Free Radic. Res. 1997; 27: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) using an SOD assay kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). This method is based on the inhibition of the reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) by SOD. Superoxide ions convert NBT into NBT-diformazan. NBT-diformazan absorbs light at 550 nm. SOD reduces the superoxide ion concentration and thereby lowers the rate of NBT-diformazan formation. The extent of reduction in the appearance of NBT-formazan reflects the amount of SOD activity in a sample. CuZn-SOD was extracted with an ethanol/chloroform method, and its activity was measured. Mn-SOD activity was determined by subtracting CuZn-SOD activity from total SOD activity. Catalase Activity Assay—Catalase activity was measured as described by Zhou et al. (31Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) using the Amplex® Red catalase assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Cells were lysed and processed in isotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 200 mm mannitol, 50 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA). In the assay, catalase first reacts with H2O2 to produce water and oxygen. Next, the Amplex Red reacts, as calculated with a 1:1 stoichiometry, with any unreacted H2O2 in the presence of horseradish peroxidase to produce the highly fluorescent oxidized product resorufin. Since resorufin has also strong absorption of 563 nm, detection of this absorbance made it possible to determine the quantity of resorufin and therefore catalase activity. Glutathione Peroxidase (GPX) Activity Assay—GPX activity was measured as described by Paglia and Valentine (32Paglia D.E. Valentine W.N. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1967; 70: 158-169PubMed Google Scholar) using a GPX assay kit (Oxis Research, Portland, OR). This assay is an indirect measure of the activity of cellular GPX. Oxidized glutathione is recycled to its reduced form by glutathione reductase. The oxidation of NADPH resulting in NAD+ is accompanied by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm so that GPX activity can be monitored. To assay cellular GPX, a cell homogenate is added to a solution containing glutathione, glutathione reductase, and NADPH. The enzyme reaction is started by adding t-butyl hydroperoxide as a substrate, and the absorbance at 340 nm is recorded every 30 s for 3 min. The rate of decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm is directly proportionate to the GPX activity in the sample. Cellular Glutathione Content Assay—Cellular glutathione content was measured using a glutathione content assay kit (GSH-400™, Oxis Research). The method used with this kit is based on a chemical reaction that proceeds in two steps. The first step is the formation of substitution products (thioethers) between 4-chloro-1-methyl-7-trifluromethylquinolinium methylsulfate and all mercaptans that are present in the sample. The second step is a β-elimination reaction under alkaline conditions, which transforms the substitution product (thioether) obtained with glutathione into a thione with a maximal absorbance at 400 nm. Cell pellets are resuspended in an ice-cold metaphosphoric acid working solution, and the cell lysate is produced by homogenizing the cell suspension. Statistical Analyses—Values are expressed as means ± S.D. Except for the fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses, all values were derived from measurements done in triplicate. Statistical analyses for multiple comparisons were performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Bonferroni's correction. Unpaired Student's t test was used for the comparison of two groups in the studies with NIH 3T3 cells (Figs. 3, 4, and 8). A p value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

These oncoproteins retain the ability to bind DNA and retinoic acid through the RARα moiety. This enables them to repress RARα target genes in the absence of retinoic acid, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be investigated. Here we use the frog oocyte system to study transcriptional regulation by PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα in the context of chromatin. We first show that the endogenous corepressor N-CoR forms a complex with TBLR1 (transducin beta-like protein 1-related protein) and that both N-CoR and TBLR1 can interact with unliganded PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα in vivo. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that both oncoproteins recruit TBLR1, as well as N-CoR, to its target promoter, leading to histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative N-CoR that contains the TBLR1-interacting domain blocks transcription repression by unliganded PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα. Thus, our studies provide in vivo evidence for targeted recruitment of N-CoR-TBLR1 complexes by PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα in transcriptional repression in the context of chromatin.

Transcriptional regulation by many kinds of transcription factors involves coactivator and corepressor complexes. The highly related corepressors N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) were first identified as proteins capable of binding unliganded thyroid hormone (T3) receptor (TR) 1The abbreviations used are: TR, thyroid hormone receptor; RA, retinoic acid; RAR, RA receptor; RARE, RA response element; PML, promyelocytic leukemia protein; PLZF, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein; IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Ac, acetylated; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; CGID, corepressor (N-CoR) and GPS2-interacting domain; F-, FLAG-tagged; HDAC, histone deacetylase. and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and acting as transcription corepressors (1Chen J.D.

Like RAR, PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα are believed to recruit HDAC-containing corepressor complexes to the RAR targets to repress their transcription. However, direct in vivo evidence to support this has been lacking.

The best characterized is the N-CoR or SMRT complex first identified in HeLa cells that contains HDAC3 and TBL1 (transducin beta-like protein 1) (23Li J. Wang J. Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1048-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, GPS2 (G-protein pathway suppressor 2) was also shown to be a component of this TBL1 or TBLR1 (TBL1-related protein 1) complex (26Zhang J. Kalkum M. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 27Yoon H.-G. Chan D.W. Huang Z.Q. Li J. Fondell J.D. Qin J. Wong J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1336-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the possibility that this complex is utilized by PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα to repress transcription in vivo in the context of chromatin. For this purpose, we took advantage of the ability of the oocyte nucleus to chromatinize microinjected exogenous DNA and the lack of sufficient endogenous RAR to regulate transcription of target genes (31Minucci S. Wong J. Blanco J.C. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Ozato K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Almouzni G. Clark D.L. Mechali M. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5767-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). By expressing PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα together with their heterodimerization partner RXRα in the frog oocyte through microinjection of their mRNAs into the cytoplasm, we showed that both PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα repress RA-responsive promoter assembled into chromatin in vivo. To study possible involvement of N-CoR-TBL1/TBLR1 complex in this repression, we cloned the frog TBLR1 and demonstrated its association with N-CoR. By using coimmunoprecipitation (IP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we showed that unliganded PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα associate with both N-CoR and TBLR1 in vivo and recruit them to RA-responsive promoters in the context of chromatin. Furthermore, by using a dominant negative N-CoR, which contains the TBLR1-binding domain, we demonstrated a critical role of N-CoR-TBLR1 interaction in gene repression by PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα under in vivo chromatin conditions. Cloning and Vectors—The N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences of human TBL1 protein (GenBank™ accession number Y12781) were used for a BLAST search (Translated BLAST Search (t-blastn), www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Five Xenopus expressed sequence tag clones (N-terminal: BG814471, BJ072201, and BJ042895, C-terminal: BJ033637 and BJ056849) showed sequence similarity to human TBL1. Two PCR primers (5′-CGG CGG CGG CCG ATG AGT ATA AGC AGT GAT GAG-3′ and 5′-CGG CGG ACT AGT CTA TTT TCG TAG GTC TAA TAC A-3′) were made based on these sequences and used for RT-PCR (SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq; Invitrogen) cloning of Xenopus TBL1 by using total RNA from stage 66 Xenopus laevis tadpoles. The PCR product was directly cloned into pCRT7-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Three different clones (pCRT7-TBLR1) were sequenced by the DNA Sequencing Facility Center for Biosystems Research at the University of Maryland (www.umbi.umd.edu/~cab/Dna.html) and found to encode a protein (TBLR1; GenBank™ accession AY225088) more similar to human TBLR1 than TBL1. For expression and detection in frog oocytes, a FLAG tag was added to the N terminus of human RARα (14Minucci S. Maccarana M. Cioce M. De Luca P. Gelmetti V. Segalla S. Di Croce L. Giavara S.

Veenstra, University of Nijmegen), which is based on the pGEM-4Z vector (Promega) and contains the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of X. laevis β-globin gene flanking the multiple cloning sites. The dominant negative N-CoR, F-DN-RD1, was made by PCR cloning of the DNA fragment corresponding to the TBL1-interacting domain (amino acids 154–304) of Xenopus N-CoR (33Sachs L.M. Jones P.L.

The pGL-RARE luciferase reporter vector (RARE-Luc) was a gift from Dr. Shinobu Tsuzuki (Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan). The backbone of this construct is pGL3-basic (Promega) and contains the DR5 sequence (5′-TCTAGGGTTCA CCGAAAGTTCA CTCGGATC-3′), the RAR/RXR binding site, followed by the TK promoter sequence inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pGL3 vector.

Histidine-Xpress-tagged Xenopus TBLR1 was obtained from Escherichia coli by using the pCRT7-TBLR1 construct. Rabbit anti-TBLR1 antiserum was raised against this protein and was affinity-purified using the glutathione S-transferase-tagged N terminus of TBLR1 (amino acids 1–211). Rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody was purchased from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Immunoprecipitation—T7Ts-FLAG-RARα, T7Ts-FLAG-PML-RARα, T7Ts-FLAG-PLZF-RARα, and pSP64-RXR (34Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol.

The mRNA (5.75 ng/oocyte) was microinjected into the cytoplasm of 20 X. laevis stage VI oocytes. After incubation overnight at 18 °C, the oocytes were lysed by pipetting in IP buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for IP with anti-FLAG-M2-agarose beads (Sigma) or affinity-purified rabbit anti-Xenopus N-CoR and TBLR1 polyclonal antibodies cross-linked to protein A-agarose. Each lysate was incubated with appropriate beads for 4 h and washed three times in IP buffer. The immunoprecipitates were eluted using 100 mm glycine and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. Transcription Assay in Xenopus Oocyte System—Stage VI oocytes from X. laevis were injected into the cytoplasm with different mRNAs (5.75 ng/oocyte for RAR/RXR, PML-RAR/RXR, or PLZF-RAR/RXR). Luciferase reporter plasmid (0.33 ng/oocyte) and the control vector (0.03 ng/oocyte) pRG-SV40 (Promega) were injected into the germinal vesicle (nucleus) after mRNA injection. After overnight incubation at 18 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μm of RA, the oocyte lysates were subjected to the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Six oocytes were used for each luciferase assay. Triplicated assays were performed at the same time, and the experiments were repeated three times. The ratio of firefly luciferase activity from the RA reporter plasmid to that from the control Renilla luciferase plasmid was determined for each assay group, and the average from the three repeats was plotted together with the standard deviation. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The ChIP assay for recruitment of corepressor complexes and histone acetylation were essentially as described (35Li J. Lin Q. Wang W. Wade P. Wong J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). F-PML-RAR mRNA and RARE-Luc reporter DNA were injected into 20 oocytes. After overnight incubation, the oocytes were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min to cross-link the DNA to histones and/or other associated proteins. After washing the oocytes with the incubation medium, the oocytes were incubated in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 10 mm DTT for 15 min at 30 °C to stop the cross-linking reaction. The oocytes were lysed by pipetting in 400 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)). The mixture was then sonicated to fragment the plasmid minichromosome (5 s for five times on ice with Branson Sonifire 450, output 2, duty, cycle 30). It is then diluted with 400 μl of ChIP I buffer (0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.4 mm PMSF) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (20,000 g) in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the sample was centrifuged again, and 200 μl of this precleared supernatant were used for IP with an indicated antibody. For FLAG ChIP, anti-FLAG-M2-agarose beads were used. Affinity-purified TBLR1 or N-CoR polyclonal antibody was used for TBLR1 or N-CoR ChIP. For acetylated histone H3 (Ac-H3) and H4 (Ac-sH4), anti-Ac-H3 and anti-Ac-H4 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) were used. Salmon sperm DNA/Protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was used for the ChIP of TBLR1, N-CoR, Ac-H3, and Ac-H4. After overnight incubation of the antibody/beads with the precleared supernatant, the mixture was centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min, and the beads were washed sequentially for 15 min each using the following buffer: ChIP I, ChIP II (0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.4 mm PMSF), ChIP III (0.25 m LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 0.4 mm PMSF), and Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris/1 mm EDTA, pH 8) with 1 mm DTT and 0.4 mm PMSF. The beads were then incubated in 200 μl of elution buffer (0.5% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) with 5 μg of proteinase K at 65 °C for overnight to reverse the DNA-protein cross-links. The eluted DNA from the beads was purified with the PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The DNA was eluted into 40 μl of Buffer EB, and 4 μl was used for each PCR reaction: 95 °C for 3 min for 1 cycle and 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s for 25 cycles. Amplified DNA was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis. PCR primers for the ChIP assay were as follows: forward 5′-ATT TTC ATT ACA TCT GTG TGT TG-3′ and reverse 5′-CAA ACC CTA ACC ACC GCT TA-3′. These primers amplify the region containing the RARE to produce fragments of 263 bp. The PCR products were quantified with BioMax 1D (Kodak, New Haven, CT). Micrococcal Nuclease Assay—MNase assay of chromatin structure was performed as described previously (36Wong J. Patterton D. Imhof D. Guschin D. Shi Y.-B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 520-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37Hsia V.S.-C. Wang H. Shi Y.-B. Cell Res. arch. 2001; 11: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 ng/oocyte of RARE-Luc reporter DNA was injected into the germinal vesicle of 30 oocytes. After overnight incubation, the injected oocytes were lysed by pipetting in 300 μl of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). Fifty μl of the lysate was used digestion with MNase (0, 0.5, 1, 5, or 20 units) for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 50 μlof2× TNESK buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 2% SDS). The mixture was treated with 10 μg of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by treatment with 75 μg of proteinase K for2hat55 °C. After phenol/chloroform extraction, DNA was purified by isopropanol precipitation and dissolved in 20 μl of water. After adding DNA loading dye, one half of each sample was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel followed by Southern blotting. For the detection, 32P-labeled RARE-TK DNA fragment derived from RARE-Luc reporter vector was used. Xenopus TBLR1 Protein Sequence Is Highly Homologous to Human TBLR1 and TBL1—Biochemical purification from several laboratories has revealed the existence of N-CoR and SMRT complexes containing TBL1 or TBLR1 in mammalian tissue culture cells (23Li J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1336-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As a first step toward studying the role of TBL1 or TBLR1 complexes in gene repression by unliganded nuclear receptors in the context of chromatin, we searched for the presence of such complexes in frog oocytes. We queried the Xenopus expressed sequence tag data base with N and C terminus amino acid sequences of human TBL1 and obtained several expressed sequence tag sequences similar to the N or C terminus of human TBL1. Two specific primers were designed to amplify the entire coding region of the gene by using RT-PCR on RNA isolated from X. laevis froglets. A single cDNA band (∼1.6 kb) was amplified (data not shown) and cloned. Three independent clones were sequenced and found to be identical, encoding a protein of 519 amino acids (Fig. 1A). This cloned Xenopus protein was found to be more similar to human TBLR1 than human TBL1 (Fig. 1B). This protein, Xenopus TBLR1, contains seven WD40 repeats and the corepressor (N-CoR) and GPS2-interacting domain (CGID) at the N terminus (Fig. 1). The CGID sequence is totally conserved between Xenopus TBLR1 and human TBLR1 and 94% identical to that of human TBL1 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the WD40 repeat domain is 98% identical between Xenopus TBLR1 and human TBLR1, whereas only 90% identical between the two human proteins. Overall, Xenopus TBLR1 shares 96% identity with human TBLR1 at the amino acid sequence level (Fig. 1B) and 84% identity at the DNA sequence level (data not shown). Such high degrees of conservation suggest similar biochemical and molecular functions. Endogenous TBLR1 Interacts with N-CoR in Xenopus Oocytes—To investigate whether TBLR1-N-CoR complexes exist in Xenopus oocytes, we generated a polyclonal antibody against Xenopus TBLR1. This antibody specifically recognized Xenopus TBLR1 translated in vitro (Fig. 2A) and could immunoprecipitate the endogenous Xenopus TBLR1 in the frog oocyte (Fig. 2B). It failed to detect any protein of the size expected for the Xenopus homolog of mammalian TBL1 (data not shown), suggesting either that a putative Xenopus TBL1 is not expressed in the oocyte or that the antibody does not cross-react with a Xenopus TBL1. To investigate the association of TBLR1 and N-CoR, we immunoprecipitated these proteins from oocyte extract with affinity-purified anti-TBLR1 (Fig. 2C, lane 3) or anti-Xenopus N-CoR (Fig. 2C, lane 2) antibody. Western blot analysis showed that both antibodies were able to bring down both proteins (Fig. 2C), indicating that endogenous TBLR1 and N-CoR interact with each other in Xenopus oocytes. Transcriptional Repression by Unliganded PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα Correlates with Interactions between Receptors and TBLR1 in Vivo—To study the possible involvement of TBLR1 in gene regulation by PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα in vivo, we made use of the frog oocyte system that we have established to study transcriptional regulation by nuclear hormone receptors in the context of chromatin (31Minucci S. Wong J. Blanco J.C. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Ozato K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34Wong J. Shi Y.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18479-18483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we microinjected in vitro transcribed mRNA encoding FLAG-tagged PML-RARα (F-PML-RAR) or PLZF-RARα (F-PLZF-RAR) together with RXR mRNA into the cytoplasm of oocytes to allow synthesis of the proteins. For comparison, we carried out the studies on RARα injecting mRNA for FLAG-tagged RARα with RXR mRNA into another batch of oocytes. A few hours later, we microinjected into the germinal vesicle (nucleus) two reporter plasmids, one containing an RA-dependent promoter driving the expression of the firefly luciferase and the other containing a control promoter driving the expression of Renilla luciferase. After an overnight incubation with or without RA, the oocytes were lysed for the luciferase assay. As expected, unliganded RAR/RXR repressed the target gene, whereas RA-bound RAR/RXR activated it (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3), as shown earlier (31Minucci S. Wong J. Blanco J.C. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Ozato K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similarly, both F-PML-RAR and F-PLZF-RAR were able to repress the RA-dependent promoter in a chromatin template in vivo and RA treatment reversed this repression (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–9). It is worth noting that although both RAR and PML-RAR were able to activate the promoter above its basal level in the presence of RA, RA merely reversed the repression caused by PLZF-RAR, consistent with earlier studies showing that PLZF-RAR is more resistant to RA treatment (10Guidez F.

To investigate whether the repression by RAR and the RAR fusion proteins involves N-CoR-TBLR1 complex, similarly treated oocytes were lysed and subjected to IP using anti-FLAG affinity agarose beads. Western blot analysis showed that endogenous N-CoR and TBLR1 associated with F-PML-RAR and F-PLZF-RAR as well as RAR in the absence of RA (Fig. 3B).

In this pathway, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CTα) plays an important regulatory role. Previous studies (Golfman, L. S., Bakovic, M., and Vance, D. E. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 43688–43692) demonstrated that CTα mRNA accumulates during S phase in preparation for cellular mitosis. We now demonstrate that increased binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the proximal promoter of CTα is responsible for increased transcription during the S phase. The Sp1 binding element present in position –67/–62 is essential for activation, and the Sp1 site in position –31/–9 is required to enhance transcription. Inhibition of Sp1 expression by RNA interference abolished the enhanced expression of CTα. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that Sp1 interacts with cyclin E, cyclin A, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 during the S phase. We conclude that Sp1 binding to the CTα proximal promoter is necessary to enhance transcription during the S phase.

The gene is transcribed from two transcriptional start sites and lacks a TATA box, but contains a GC-rich region that is characteristic of many TATA-less promoters (16Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W.

There are additional candidate binding sites for other transcription factors that include Ap1, Ap2, signal transducer and activator of transcription, and NFκB (16Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the proximal promoter of the CTα gene three Sp1 binding elements have been identified that are involved in basal, activator, and suppressor activities (16Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 can competitively bind to these elements, and the relative abundance of these factors can regulate the expression of the CTα gene (17Bakovic M. Waite K.A. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sp3 has recently been identified as being of central importance for the enhanced expression of CTα in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts that have been stably transfected with a cDNA encoding Ras (20Bakovic M. Waite K.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14753-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Roles for transcriptional enhancer factor-4 and Ets in regulating the expression of CTα have also been identified (18Sugimoto H. Bakovic M. Yamashita S. Vance D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12338-12344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Sugimoto H. Sugimoto S. Tatei K. Obinata H. Bakovic M. Izumi T. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

A 2-fold stimulation of CTα expression by sterol response element-binding protein appears to occur upon binding to the proximal promoter (21Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Anisfeld A.M. Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, increased PC synthesis that occurs after the induction by sterol response element-binding protein appears to be largely a result of increased fatty acid biosynthesis (22Lagace T.A. Storey M.K. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14367-14374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Ridgway N.D. Lagace T.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Unlike sterol or fatty acid biosynthesis, large changes in the rate of PC biosynthesis do not occur, probably because of the critical role of PC in cell survival (24Tercé F. Brun H. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Moreover, genes that have TATA-less promoters are often referred to as “housekeeping” genes. However, to describe the CTα gene as “housekeeping” is inappropriate because the gene is critical for cell survival. Because the changes in CT activity are not dramatic under various perturbations, it is often assumed that the expression of the CTα gene is not differentially regulated. This is not the case, but instead the tight control of the expression of CTα gene presents a more difficult challenge for elucidation of its regulation. We have used two cell model systems to begin to unravel cellular mechanisms that regulate the expression of the CTα gene. In cells stably transfected with Ras we have discovered that the enhanced expression of CTα is due to a higher affinity of Sp3 for the proximal promoter (20Bakovic M. Waite K.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14753-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In another model, in which expression of CTα was investigated during the cell cycle, the expression of the CTα gene was enhanced during the S phase (15Golfman L.S. Bakovic M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43688-43692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present study we have extended the cell cycle studies and provide evidence that Sp1 is the major transcription factor that stimulates the expression of CTα during the S phase of the cell cycle. Materials—The luciferase vector, pGL3-basic, that contains the cDNA encoding Photinus pyralis luciferase, the control pRL-CMV vector that contains the cDNA encoding Renilla reniformis luciferase, pSV-β-galactosidase vector as a transfection control, and the dualluciferase Reporter Assay System were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). LipofectAMINE Plus reagent, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, anti-cyclin D, anti-cyclin A, and anti-CDK2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ECL® immunoblotting reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. The cell cycle was arrested in G0 by incubation of cells in culture medium containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h and released by addition of fresh medium containing 10% FBS. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation into DNA—For the analysis of DNA synthetic rates, [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi, 1 μm) was added to triplicate 35-mm dishes 1 h before cells were harvested. At each time point, the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 10 min on ice to precipitate DNA. The dishes were washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitated material was scraped into 0.2% SDS in 0.1N NaOH. Radioactivity associated with the trichloroacetic acid precipitate was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Preparation of Deleted and Mutated CTα Promoter-Luciferase Reporters—CTα promoter-luciferase constructs, LUC.C7 (–1268/+38), LUC.C8 (–201/+38), LUC.D1 (–90/+38), and LUC.D2 (–130/+38), were inserted into the promoter-less luciferase vector pGL3-basic (Promega) as described previously (16Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To prepare mutated promoter constructs, GCCC (–139/-136) was mutated to AGCT and named LUC. mSp1(C)/C7, CGGGCG (–67/–62) was changed to AATTCA and named LUC.mSp1(B)/C7, and CCGGG was changed for GGTAC (–21/–17) and named LUC.mSp1(A)/C7. Double mutants were constructed by the same procedure but for template we used single mutants. Vectors enabling expression of recombinant Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were obtained from Dr. R. Tjian (pPacSp1 and pPac0) (27Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) and Dr. J. Noti (pPacSp3) (28Noti J.D. J. Biol.

Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Total nuclear extracts of C3H10T1/2 cells grown to different stages of the cell cycle were prepared as described (29Andrew N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Promoter fragments (–210/+38), (–130/+38), and (–90/+38) were released from pLUC.C8, D2 or D1 by restriction digestion with KpnI and HindIII. Promoter fragments were purified from 2% agarose gels using the Qiaex II gel extraction kits (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions and end-labeled using Klenow polymerase fragments in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. An oligonucleotide with the Sp1-consensus sequence (5′-ATTCGATCGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) was synthesized by the University of Alberta Core Facility. Complementary oligonucleotides (100 μm of each) were heated at 90 °C for 5 min, then slowly cooled to room temperature, and 5 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide was 5′ end-labeled using T4 kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For each binding reaction (40 μl), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 20 μl of 2× binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 5mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol), 1 μg nuclear extract, and labeled probe (20,000 cpm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For gel mobility super shift analyses, 5 μl of antibody specific for either Sp1 or Sp3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added for 15 min prior to incubation of the probe with nuclear protein. For gel shift inhibition assays, protein and antibody were incubated for 30 min before addition of the probe. Binding reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 μl of gel loading buffer (30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1%(w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The complex was separated on a non-denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Immunoblot Analyses—Nuclear proteins (10 μg) from C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were heated for 3 min at 90 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, and 0.004% bromphenol blue. The protein samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS buffer. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol). Following transfer, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with 5% skim milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h with antibody raised against the protein as indicated. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Construction of Plasmids that Contain DNA Templates for the Synthesis of siRNAs under the Control of the U6 Promoter—DNA oligonucleotide templates for the in vitro synthesis of siRNAs were chemically synthesized by University of Alberta Core Facility. The oligonuclotides were designed to contain a nucleotide sequence specific for the mRNA of Sp1 (ggctgctacccccaacttac). After annealing, the DNA was cloned into the ApaI and EcoRI sites of pSilencer (Ambion). The plasmid harboring the insert, named pCBEd1, was confirmed by sequencing and transfected into cells with LipofectAMINE using concentrations indicated in each case. Inmunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above from cells collected after 20 h of cell cycle induction. Nuclear extract proteins (200 μg) were incubated with 5 μg of polyclonal anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1 ml final volume containing immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v)). The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C then incubated for 30 min with 50 μl 10% protein A-Sepharose (Staphylococcus aureus, Cowan strain), and the complex was washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. The pellet was re-suspended in 30 μl of concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled, and the supernatant was electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with the indicated antibodies. Sp1 Interacts with the CTα Promoter during the S Phase of the Cell Cycle—Previous studies (15Golfman L.S. Bakovic M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43688-43692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that expression of CTα mRNA increased during cell cycle progression from G1 and reached a maximum during S phase. To identify the minimal promoter fragment that would stimulate CTα transcription during S phase, we analyzed luciferase activity in 3 different 5′ deletion constructs, LUC.C7 (–1268/+38), LUC.D1 (–90/+38), and LUC.D3 (–52/+38). Fig. 1 shows that partial transcriptional activation during S phase was maximal with LUC.C7 and was maintained with the LUC.D1 construct, but not with the LUC.D3 construct, indicating that the 40 bp between –52 and –90 are essential for activity during S phase. LUC.D3 showed basal activity as previously described (16Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To investigate the transcription factor(s) involved in regulation of CTα promoter activity during S phase, we utilized electromobility shift assays to determine whether protein(s) present in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts bind to the CTα proximal promoter region (–90/+38) during S phase. One DNA-protein complex was clearly observed at all points of the cell cycle (Fig. 2A). However, the abundance of the complex increased in nuclear extracts obtained 20 h after cell cycle induction (Fig. 2A). We confirmed that 20 h following cell cycle induction corresponds to S phase of the cell cycle by measuring the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (Fig. 2B) and by immunoblot analysis of cyclin D1 (Fig. 2C). Cyclin D1 expression was used as an indicator of cell cycle re-entry because cyclin D1 is not expressed in cells arrested in G0, but its expression is induced after serum stimulation, starting in middle G1 (30Northwood I.C. Tong A.H.Y. Crawford B. Drobnies A.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In cycling cells, cyclin D1 is expressed throughout the cell-cycle, although its levels continue to peak at late G1.Fig. 2Binding of nuclear extracts to a fragment of the CTα promoter (–90/+38). A, the 3′ end-labeled probe D1 (–90/+38) was incubated with nuclear extracts from C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts harvested at indicated time points after cell cycle induction in the presence (+) or absence of antibody to Sp1 (Ac-Sp1) or Sp3 (Ac-Sp3).

Previous studies (16Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 bind the CTα promoter region and regulate its basal expression. Hence, for the EMSAs we used antibodies raised against Sp1 or Sp3. Fig. 2A shows that the addition of anti-Sp1 (2 μg) markedly reduced the DNA-protein complex formation. The presence of anti-Sp3 antibody did not reduce formation of the DNA-protein complex. These results strongly suggest that Sp1 binds to the CTα proximal promoter during the S phase in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. To confirm these results we used EMSAs to investigate the capacity of the same nuclear extract to bind a 20-bp DNA that contained the Sp1 binding consensus sequence (31Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 2A, Fig. 3 shows the profile obtained with the Sp1 consensus element in which the protein-DNA complex formation increased in nuclear extracts obtained during S phase. As in the experiment depicted in Fig. 2A, interaction between DNA and protein decreased when we added anti-Sp1 antibody, but no decrease in the intensity of the retarded band was observed with anti-Sp3 antibody. The reason for the slower migrating smudge in lanes 6 and 7 is not clear and was not observed in other analyses. These results confirm that Sp1 is the major nuclear transcription factor that binds the CTα promoter during the S phase in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. The Induction of CTα Promoter Activity During S Phase Is Abolished in a CTα Promoter Construct Lacking the Sp1 Binding Site B—In the CTα promoter region there are three Sp1 binding elements: A (–22/–15), B (–70/–58), and C (–144/–135) (Fig. 1A) that are involved in the regulation of CTα expression (16Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 can competitively bind to these regions, and the relative abundance of these factors regulates promoter activity of the CTα gene (17Bakovic M. Waite K.A. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated the role of these three binding sites in the regulation of CTα expression during different stages of the cell cycle. We analyzed luciferase activity using the Pcyt1a reporter plasmid LUC.C7 (–1268/+38) and different mutated constructs of one or more of the Sp1 binding sites. These plasmids were introduced into C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblasts by transient transfection. After synchronization and cell cycle induction, luciferase activity was measured. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, the luciferase activity of the site A mutant (LUC.mSp1(A)/C7) increased with time with an activity profile similar to that of the wild-type reporter construct (LUC.C7). However, the level of expression was markedly (40%) lower than for the wild-type LUC.C7 after 18 h. The LUC.mSp1(C)/C7 mutant showed higher luciferase activity at all time points analyzed. Most strikingly, the mutant LUC.mSp1(B)/C7 showed low luciferase activity and no induction during S phase. Studies with constructs in which two Sp1 binding sites were mutated showed low activity when only site C was active (LUC.mSp1AB). In contrast, the luciferase activity increased during S phase in the LUC.mSp1AC mutant where only site B was active (Fig. 4B). Together these results indicate that the Sp1 binding site B is the minimal necessary element required for cell cycle induction of CTα promoter activity. Because Ets has been previously implicated in the expression of the CTα gene (19Sugimoto H. Sugimoto S. Tatei K. Obinata H. Bakovic M. Izumi T. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19716-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we examined the expression of LUC.C7 in which the Ets element of the CTα promoter was mutated. The expression of the mutated construct was decreased by 70% compared with LUC.C7, but there was still an increase of expression during the S phase of the cell cycle. Hence, Ets appears to be required for optimal reporter activity but does not seem to be involved in the enhanced expression of the CTα promoter observed in the S phase. Interference with Sp1 Expression Decreases CTα Promoter Activity during S Phase—RNA interference is the process of sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is homologous in sequence to the silenced gene. The mediators of sequence-specific messenger RNA degradation are 21 or 22 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNA) generated by ribonuclease III cleavage from longer dsRNAs (32Paddison P.J Caudy A.A. Berstein E. Hannon G. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). We have used this technique to suppress expression of endogenous Sp1 for studying its function in CTα regulation during the cell cycle. Murine embryo fibroblasts were co-transfected with a pCBEd1 plasmid (0.1 μg and 1 μg), harboring the Sp1 DNA sequence specific for the in vitro synthesis of siRNAs that would attenuate reporter plasmid LUC.C7 (1 μg), and pSV-β–galactosidase (1 μg). Luciferase activity was analyzed at various time points after cell cycle induction. Fig. 5A shows that the CTα promoter activity clearly increased during cell cycle progression reaching a maximum in S-phase (20 h) in cells transfected with LUC.C7 and the empty plasmid pSilencer. However, in cells where Sp1 expression was attenuated with RNAi directed against Sp1, up to 50% reduction in S phase of the CTα promoter activity was observed (Fig. 5A). Because transfection efficiency was only about 10%, we were not able to detect a difference in the level of Sp1 expression or endogenous CT activity (data not shown). To evaluate the ability of pCBEd1 to inhibit Sp1 expression, cells were co-transfected with PacSp1 (0.05 μg) (an expression vector encoding Sp1) and pCBEd1 (1 μg) or pSilencer (1 μg). Immunoblot analysis showed a clear suppression of Sp1 expression in cells transfected with pCBEd1 (Fig. 5B). As indicated, the expression of the transcription factor TFIID was unaffected by pCBEd1 expression. These results demonstrate that inhibition of Sp1 expression by siRNA attenuated the induction of CTα promoter activity during S phase of the cell cycle. We also measured endogenous CT activity and [3H]choline incorporation in cells that were transfected with either pPac0 or pPacSp1. There was no difference in CT activity detected or in the incorporation of [3H]choline into PC. As the transfection efficiency is ∼10%, this result is not unexpected. The Presence of Sp1 Is Necessary, but Not Sufficient, to Enhance CTα Promoter Activity during the S Phase—Previous studies (17Bakovic M. Waite K.A. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have established that the CTα promoter can be activated by both Sp1 and Sp3. We, therefore, next examined the ability of Sp1 and Sp3 to individually enhance CTα promoter activity during S phase of the cell cycle. We co-transfected Sp1 or Sp3 expression vectors (pPacSp1 or pPacSp3), or the empty plasmid pPac0, with a"
https://openalex.org/W1964088851,"Factor XIII is activated by thrombin, and this reaction is enhanced by the presence of fibrin(ogen). Using a substrate-based screening assay for factor XIII activity complemented by kinetic analysis of activation peptide cleavage, we show by using thrombin mutants of surface-exposed residues that Arg-178, Arg-180, Asp-183, Glu-229, Arg-233, and Trp-50 of thrombin are necessary for direct activation of factor XIII. These residues define a low specificity site known to be important also for both protein C activation and for inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin. The enhancing effect of fibrinogen occurs as a consequence of its conversion to fibrin and subsequent polymerization. Surface residues of thrombin further involved in high specificity fibrin-enhanced factor XIII activation were identified as His-66, Tyr-71, and Asn-74. These residues represent a distinct interaction site on thrombin (within exosite I) also employed by thrombomodulin in its cofactor-enhanced activation of protein C. In competition experiments, thrombomodulin inhibited fibrin-enhanced factor XIII activation. Based upon these and prior published results, we propose that the polymerization process forms a fibrin cofactor that acts to approximate thrombin and factor XIII bound to separate and complementary domains of fibrinogen. This enables enhanced factor XIII activation to be localized around the fibrin clot. We also conclude that proximity to and competition for cofactor interaction sites primarily directs the fate of thrombin.

We also conclude that proximity to and competition for cofactor interaction sites primarily directs the fate of thrombin. Following initiation of coagulation, a series of carefully regulated serine proteinase reactions take place resulting in the generation of thrombin and the formation of an insoluble fibrin clot. Thrombin is a serine proteinase responsible for proteolytic cleavage of multiple substrates involved in the coagulation pathway (1Esmon C.T. Science. 1987; 235: 1348-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 2Mann K.G. Lundblad R.L. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Haemostasis and Thrombosis. 2nd Ed. Churchill Livingstone, New York1987: 148-161Google Scholar). One of the main roles of thrombin is the conversion of fibrinogen to an insoluble fibrin clot. This process is initiated by proteolytic cleavage of two pairs of fibrinopeptides, FPA 1The abbreviations used are: FPA and FPB, fibrinopeptides A and B, respectively; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; WT, wild-type. and FPB, from the Aα- and Bβ-chains of fibrinogen, respectively. FPA is cleaved first, leading to spontaneous polymerization of the fibrin monomers. This is shortly followed by proteolysis of the Bβ-chain, which is associated with lateral aggregation of the fibrin protofibrils to produce thicker fiber bundles (3Weisel J.W. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 1079-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4Weisel J.W. Veklich Y. Gorkun O.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To ensure a more stable clot structure, activated factor XIII (factor XIIIa), a transglutaminase, covalently cross-links specific glutamine and lysine side chains of the protofibrils, resulting in increased resistance of the clot to chemical, physical, and proteolytic insults (5Ichinose A. Bloom A.L. Forbes C.D. Thomas D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Haemostasis and Thrombosis. Churchill Livingstone, New York1994: 531-546Google Scholar, 6Lorand L Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 291-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Factor XIII is a heterologous tetramer with a molecular mass of 324,000 Daltons. It consists of two A-subunits that contain the active site of the transglutaminase and two B-subunits that serve a carrier function for the hydrophobic A-subunit in the aqueous environment of human plasma (5Ichinose A. Bloom A.L. Forbes C.D. Thomas D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Haemostasis and Thrombosis. Churchill Livingstone, New York1994: 531-546Google Scholar, 6Lorand L Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 291-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thrombin activates factor XIII by cleavage of a 37 amino acid activation peptide from the factor XIII A-subunits (7Takagi T. Doolittle R.F Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Consequently, the carrier B-subunits dissociate from the activated A-subunits to completely unmask the active site (8Lorand L. Gray A.J. Brown K. Credo R.B. Curtis C.G. Domanik R.A. Stenberg P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 56: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Activation of factor XIII is closely controlled by the presence of its substrate fibrin(ogen). The presence of fibrin(ogen) accelerates activation of factor XIII ∼80-fold (9Janus T.J. Lewis S.D. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6269-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This acceleration is caused by an enhancing effect of fibrin on both thrombin cleavage of the factor XIII activation peptide and dissociation of the factor XIII A- and B-subunits. It has been shown that residues 242–424 in the αC-domain of fibrinogen regulate the dissociation of the B-chains from the thrombin-cleaved A-subunits of factor XIII (10Credo R.B. Curtis C.G. Lorand L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3770-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The enhancement effect of fibrinogen on factor XIII activation can be readily inhibited by specific inhibitors of fibrin polymerization (11Ariens R.A.S. Philippou H. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Lane D.A. Grant P.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 988-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Greenberg C.S. Miraglia C.C. Blood. 1985; 66: 466-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the process by which polymerizing fibrin enhances the activation of factor XIII is poorly understood. Approximately 10% total fibrinogen exists as a variant known as γ′. This fibrinogen variant occurs by alternative splicing of mRNA resulting in the deletion of four amino acids from the C terminus of γA with a substitution of an additional 20 amino acid residues (13Fornace A.J. Cummings D.E. Comeau C.M. Kant J.A. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12826-12830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ′-region is thought to bind factor XIII zymogen and thrombin (14Meh D.A. Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23121-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) but the functional consequences of this for factor XIII activation are as yet uncertain (15Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition to activating factor XIII and proteolytic cleavage of FPA and FPB from fibrinogen, thrombin is also responsible for numerous other proteolytic interactions. It activates factors V, VIII, XI, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (2Mann K.G. Lundblad R.L. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Haemostasis and Thrombosis. 2nd Ed. Churchill Livingstone, New York1987: 148-161Google Scholar, 16Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 28: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Furthermore, thrombin cleaves the protease (activated) receptors, resulting in platelet activation and aggregation (17Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). These functions of thrombin are all procoagulant (ultimately promoting clot formation). However, thrombin is also able to behave as an anticoagulant by activating protein C when bound to thrombomodulin. Activated protein C cleaves and thereby inhibits both activated factors V and VIII. Additionally, thrombin is directly inhibited by formation of an irreversible complex with antithrombin. As substrates of thrombin participate in either procoagulant or anticoagulant functions, thrombin is critical for regulating hemostasis. The unique specificity of thrombin toward its substrates is thought to arise by combination of insertion loops flanking the upper and lower faces of the active site (Leu-46/Asn-57 and Leu-144/Gly-155), which occlude and restrict the active site and two exosites (I and II) on opposite faces of the active cleft. Binding of substrates, cofactors, and inhibitors to either exosite is important for overcoming restricted access to the active site. The sodium-binding site defined by a cylindrical channel shaped by three β-strands appears to be important for the procoagulant (fast) form of thrombin (18Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D.

The aim of this study was to determine how thrombin specifically recognizes factor XIII in preference to its many other substrates and how activation can be enhanced by fibrin. For this purpose, we have utilized a library of 53 thrombin mutants encompassing a total of 78 surface exposed, charged, and polar residues mutated to alanine. This library has previously been used to identify residues of thrombin involved in the interaction with many of its substrates including protein C, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, fibrinogen (19Hall S.W. Nagashima M. Zhao L. Morser J. Leung L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25510-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), antithrombin (20Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Gibbs C.S. J.

Blood. 2002; 100: 2820-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we have used the library to investigate which residues of thrombin are involved in direct factor XIII activation and in the fibrin-enhanced reaction. Knowledge of these residues has enabled us to draw general conclusions about how the activities of thrombin are directed. A library of 53 thrombin mutants encompassing a total of 78 surface exposed charged and polar residues mutated to alanine was prepared and checked for amidolytic activity as described previously (Table I) (20Tsiang M.

These mutant thrombins were screened for their ability to activate factor XIII using a modification of a 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine incorporation assay (24Song Y.C. Sheng D. Taubenfeld S.M. Matsueda G.R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Factor XIII was purified from plasma donor pools using previously described methods (11Ariens R.A.S. Philippou H. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Lane D.A. Grant P.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 988-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To screen for factor XIII activation in the absence of fibrin(ogen), we first coated microtiter plates with 10 μg/ml N,N-dimethyl casein (Sigma) for 16 h. Factor XIII (6.7 nm) and 36 nm human thrombin (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) were added and incubated in activation buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3) containing 0.1 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (Perbio Science UK Limited, Cheshire, United Kingdom) for 60 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 mm EDTA, pH 8.3. The amount of factor XIII that was activated by thrombin was determined by measuring the amount of 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine cross-linked to the N,N-dimethylcasein using an alkaline phosphatase streptavidin conjugate (Sigma) followed by incubation with p-nitrophenol substrate (Sigma) and detection of the signal at 405 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Labsystems, Hampshire, United Kingdom).Table IEffect of thrombin mutants on the direct activation of factor XIIIMutationaResidues numbered consecutively from the start of the thrombin B-chain, 1-259.

Open table in a new tab To assess the activity of thrombin mutants for either fibrinogen-enhanced or fibrin-enhanced activation of factor XIII, microtiter plates were coated with either (i) 0.12 nm fibrinogen (Calbiochem and Merck Biosciences Ltd, Nottingham, United Kingdom) for 1 h or (ii) 0.12 nm fibrinogen for 1 h, which was preincubated with 46 nm thrombin for 20 min in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C to form fibrin. Residual thrombin was removed by thorough washing using 40 mm Tris-HCl, 750 mm NaCl, pH 8.3, followed by a final wash with 40 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 8.3. For both fibrinogen-enhanced and fibrin-enhanced factor XIII activation, 6.7 nm factor XIII and 18 nm thrombin were incubated in activation buffer containing 0.1 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine for 8 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 mm EDTA, pH 8.3. The amount of factor XIII that was activated by thrombin was determined by measuring the amount of 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine cross-linked to the fibrin(ogen) using alkaline phosphatase streptavidin conjugate followed by incubation with p-nitrophenol substrate (and measuring at 405 nm). When activation of factor XIII by thrombin was performed in the presence of thrombomodulin, increasing molar concentrations of rabbit thrombomodulin (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) were preincubated with 1.8 nm human thrombin prior to the addition of 6.7 nm factor XIII (in the absence and presence of fibrin, see above). Factor XIII activation peptide cleavage was determined by reverse-phase HPLC using a Pepmap 0.46 × 250 mm C18 column (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom) and the AKTA basic chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Application and elution buffers for HPLC were phosphate- and acetonitrile-based as previously described (11Ariens R.A.S. Philippou H. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Lane D.A. Grant P.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 988-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with elution using an 8.5–40% acetonitrile gradient. Purified factor XIII was dialyzed against reaction buffer (9.47 mm sodium phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, pH 7.4) prior to use. In the absence of fibrinogen, 1.8 μm factor XIII was incubated at 37 °C with 4.1 nm of the thrombin mutant under investigation. 100-μl samples were then removed at five intervals between 1 and 220 min (dependent on the expected activity of the mutant in question). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 3 m perchloric acid, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and 100 μl of sample was loaded onto the C18 column. To investigate factor XIII activation peptide release in the presence of fibrinogen, 1.8 μm factor XIII and 3.1 μm fibrinogen were incubated at 37 °C with 1.83 nm of the thrombin mutant in question. The reaction mixture was immediately aliquoted into 100-μl volumes to avoid subsampling difficulties following fibrin formation. Reactions were stopped at five intervals between 1 and 160 min by the addition of 10 μl of 3 m perchloric acid. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and 100 μl of the reaction was loaded onto the C18 column. The relative amounts of activation peptides released were determined by measurement of the areas under the respective peaks using Unicorn Analysis software (Amersham Biosciences). Catalytic efficiencies were calculated by fitting of the data from time course experiments to Equation 1 (9Janus T.J. Lewis S.D. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6269-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), kcat/Km=-ln(1-[AP]/[APf])[E]×t(Eq. 1) where [AP] is the concentration of activation peptide at a given time, [APf] is the concentration at full activation, [E] is the total concentration of thrombin, and t is time. Data fitting was performed using Enzfitter software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). This equation was used to fit all of the activation peptide release curves, although it is recognized that this is an approximation in the cases of fibrinogen-enhanced factor XIII activation peptide release and for FPB release. Purified fibrinogen fragment D was also studied as an enhancer of factor XIII activation. The fragment D preparation (Calbiochem) was first characterized with respect to its ability to bind factor XIII as it is sensitive to proteolytic cleavage at its C terminus where a factor XIII binding site is located. Binding analysis of factor XIII to both fragment D and fibrinogen was carried out with surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 3000 system (BIAcore UK, Stevenage, United Kingdom). Fragment D at 75 μg/ml and fibrinogen at 50 μg/ml were covalently coupled to an activated carboxymethyl dextran-coated biosensor chip (CM5) using the manufacturer's recommended protocol for kinetic analysis. The conditions employed were similar to those employed elsewhere (25Tsurupa G. Tsonev L. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6449-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) for the study of tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen binding to the αC-domain of fibrinogen. However, the running buffer contained 5 mm EDTA rather than 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the chip was regenerated using buffer containing 750 mm NaCl. The association and dissociation data were recorded after subtraction of signal in the reference cell, which was activated and blocked in the absence of ligand. Each data set was generated using factor XIII in a range of concentrations between 7.8 and 125 nm and was fitted to the 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model using the BIAevaluation software supplied with the equipment. Fibrinogen and fragment D were found to be able to bind factor XIII with K Ds of 210 ± 69 nm (n = 6) and 198 ± 54 nm (n = 6), respectively. In the reactions to study enhancement of factor XIII activation, a 2-fold molar excess of the isolated fragment D was used (as fibrinogen contains two D-domains). Specifically, 1.8 μm factor XIII and either 2.25 μm fibrinogen or 4.5 μm fragment D were incubated at 37 °C with 1.83 nm wild-type (WT) thrombin. The reaction mixture was immediately aliquoted into 100-μl volumes. The reactions were then stopped at five intervals (between 1 and 16 min for fibrinogen and between 1 and 80 min for fragment D) by the addition of 10 μl of 3 m perchloric acid followed by HPLC, as explained above. The 53-variant thrombins were screened for their abilities to activate factor XIII in the absence of fibrinogen using the casein-coated microtiter plate assay with incorporation of pentylamine used as the reporter for factor XIIIa activity. Only three thrombin mutants showed <50% WT activity (see results marked by asterisk in Table I). These were a triple mutant of residues Arg-178/Arg-180/Asp-183 and mutants of Glu-229 and Arg-233 that had 41, 6.9, and 39% activity, respectively. Mutant W50A showed 53% activity (see Table I). These three variants, E229A, R233A, and R178A/R180A/D183A, together with W50A were assessed further using increasing amounts of thrombin to confirm the role of these residues in the activation of factor XIII (data not shown). Each mutant required 4–8-fold increases in concentration to achieve the activity attained by WT thrombin. The above results in Table I, obtained with the microtiter plate-screening assay, employed an arbitrary cutoff of 50% WT activity to select the thrombin mutants with reduced ability to activate factor XIII. To obtain a more reliable and quantitative assessment of activity reduction, the kinetic parameter k cat/K m was determined for WT and mutant thrombins. This was achieved by determination of factor XIII activation peptide release using HPLC analysis. As factor XIII was isolated from normal pooled plasma, its activation peptide was heterogeneous, containing the polymorphic forms Val-34 and Leu-34 (see Fig. 1A). Rather than sum the relative amounts of each form, their individual relative release rates were determined for each thrombin preparation (see time courses of release in Figs. 1, C and D). The results of catalytic efficiency determinations are illustrated in Fig. 2. The k cat/K m values obtained for the activation of Val-34 and Leu-34 forms of the factor XIII using WT thrombin (0.18 ± 0.008 and 0.33 ± 0.049 μm–1 s–1, respectively) conform to prior reports using plasma with human thrombin as an activator (11Ariens R.A.S. Philippou H. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Lane D.A. Grant P.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 988-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each thrombin mutant with <50% WT activity selected from Table I for kinetic analysis had greatly reduced k cat/K m with the R233A mutant being particularly affected (k cat/K m of 0.011 ± 0.0008 and 0.018 ± 0.001 μm–1 s–1 for cleavage of the Val-34 and Leu-34 forms of activation peptide, respectively) (Fig. 2). The position of the mutated residues on the surface of thrombin (see below) together with their limited number suggests that activation of factor XIII in the absence of cofactor is due primarily to direct (and inefficient) interactions of factor XIII within the long extended active site cleft between the S1 specificity pocket and exosite II.Fig. 2k cat /K m determinations for cleavage of the factor XIII activation peptide by WT thrombin and mutants. The mutants identified in Table I as having reduced ability to activate factor XIII (in the absence of fibrinogen) were investigated in solution with factor XIII and kinetic parameter k cat/K m determined from HPLC analysis of the activation peptides. The results for the two polymorphic forms (Val-34 and Leu-34) are depicted in separate panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Preliminary screening experiments for fibrinogen-enhanced factor XIII activation used microtiter plates coated with fibrinogen and utilizing pentylamine incorporation into the resultant fibrin by activated factor XIII as a reporter. The rate of factor XIII activation was greatly enhanced by the presence of fibrinogen, requiring only 8 min and 50% less thrombin to achieve the equivalent amount of factor XIII activity generated in1hin the absence of fibrinogen. More thrombin residues were found to influence fibrinogen-enhanced factor XIII activation when compared with direct factor XIII activation alone (Table II). Thrombin variants with 50% or less activities compared with WT were H66A, Y71A, N74A (which map to exosite I of thrombin), and R89A/R93A/E94A (which map to exosite II) in addition to the previously characterized mutants W50A, R178A/R180A/D183A, E229A, and R233A. Dose-response experiments for these mutant thrombins showed that 4–8-fold increased amounts of the mutants were required to attain WT thrombin activity, confirming the validity of the screening assay (results not shown).Table IIThrombin mutants with reduced ability to activate factor XIII in the presence of fibrinogen and preformed fibrinMutation% ActivityFibrinogen-enhanced factor XIII activationFibrin-enhanced factor XIII activationMean ± S.D.Mean ± S.D.Wild-type100 ± 4.0100 ± 4.0W50A16 ± 1.321 ± 3.7H66A20 ± 4.119 ± 2.4Y71A34 ± 1.536 ± 5.3N74A44 ± 1.449 ± 8.8R89A/R93A/E94A36 ± 8.568 ± 9.3R178A/R180A/D183A23 ± 3.026 ± 5.0E229A7.4 ± 1.329 ± 0.9R233A27 ± 1.922 ± 5.1 Open table in a new tab All of the mutants that resulted in reduced fibrinogen-enhanced activation of factor XIII were studied further in experiments in which factor XIII activation was carried out on the surface of preformed fibrin. Fibrinogen coated onto microtiter plates was preincubated with WT thrombin to form fibrin. Thrombin was subsequently removed by washing with 40 mm Tris-HCl, 750 mm NaCl, pH 8.3. Complete removal of thrombin was confirmed by the absence of activation of factor XIII in the blank sample. Fibrin-enhanced factor XIII activation by the mutants was then assessed. The results (Table II) show that mutants with impaired direct activation of factor XIII (Trp-50, Arg-178/Arg-180/Asp-183, Glu-229, and Arg-233) have reduced activity in this assay as might be expected because of their essential role in factor XIII activation. Furthermore, mutation of residues His-66, Tyr-71, and Asn-74 as well as reducing fibrinogen-enhanced factor XIII activation directly reduces fibrin-enhanced factor XIII activation (19 ± 2.4, 36 ± 5.3, and 49 ± 8.8% (mean ± S.D.), respectively of WT thrombin activity) (Table II). The mutation of residues Arg-89, Arg-93, and Glu-94 affects fibrinogen-enhanced activation of factor XIII (36 ± 8.5% WT thrombin activity) more than fibrin-enhanced factor XIII activation (68 ± 9.3% of WT activity). This probably reflects their important role in fibrinopeptide cleavage. Thrombin mutants H66A, Y71A, and N74A therefore influenced both fibrinogen- and fibrin-enhanced factor XIII activation in the microtiter plate assays and were subsequently assessed further by HPLC analysis of the activation peptide release in the presence of fibrinogen. The activation experiments generated activation peptides from both factor XIII (Val-34 and Leu-34 forms of the activation peptide) and fibrinogen (FPA and FPB). These peptides were completely resolved on HPLC (Fig. 1B) and estimates for the catalytic efficiencies for each of these cleavage reactions were obtained (Table III). The presence of fibrinogen enhanced the release of the Val-34 and Leu-34 factor XIII activation peptides by WT thrombin to k cat/K m of 2.29 ± 0.21 and 2.84 ± 0.38 μm–1 s–1, respectively. Each of the three mutants, H66A, Y71A, and N74A, had reduced enhancement effects, and Y71A was particularly reduced with k cat/K m values of 0.038 ± 0.002 and 0.11 ± 0.016 μm–1 s–1 for cleavage of the Val-34 and Leu-34 activation peptides, respectively. These data confirm reduced fibrin-enhanced factor XIII activation of the three mutants. However, it is evident from Table III that the mutants also had impaired ability to convert fibrinogen to fibrin. The k cat/K m for WT thrombin cleavage of FPA is 4.54 ± 0.58 μm–1 s–1 and is lower for all of the mutants falling to 0.023 ± 0.0004 μm–1 s–1 for Y71A. There was a parallel reduction in the catalytic efficiencies associated with FPB release (Table III). These data show that residues His-66, Tyr-71, and Asn-74 have a role in FPA and FPB cleavage as well as fibrin-enhanced FXIII activation.Table IIIKinetic evaluation (kcat/Km) of activation peptide cleavage during the fibrinogen-enhanced activation of factor XIII by WT and mutant thrombinsMutationk cat/KmVal-34Leu-34FPAFPBμM-1 s-1Wild-type2.29 ± 0.212.84 ± 0.384.54 ± 0.581.38 ± 0.007N74A0.94 ± 0.301.49 ± 0.831.78 ± 0.610.62 ± 0.25H66A0.33 ± 0.050.58 ± 0.160.53 ± 0.100.15 ± 0.002Y71A0.038 ± 0.0020.11 ± 0.0160.023 ± 0.0040.011 ± 0.003 Open table in a new t"

Residual peptidase activities after the reaction were determined in buffer A containing 1 mm CBZ-Ala-Phe-OH and 1.5 m GdnHCl. PMSF and PCMB were extensively diluted under such conditions. The second-order reaction rate constants, k 2nd, for PMSF and PCMB were estimated using the following equation, k2nd=-ln([E]/[E]0)/t[R]0(Eq. 1) where [E]0 and [E] are the total and unmodified enzyme concentrations, respectively, [R]0 is the initial PMSF or PCMB concentration, t is the incubation time, and the [E]/[E]0 was calculated from the residual peptidase activity. To estimate the incorporation of DFP into the CPY-IC complex, free CPY (1 nmol) and the complex (1 nmol) were incubated with a 50-fold molar excess of [3H]DFP in buffer A containing either 1 m GdnHCl or none at 25 °C for 1 h. Excess reagents were removed by dialysis against buffer A, and the radioactivity incorporated into each enzyme was measured by counting for 10 min with a liquid scintillation counter. For the preparation of DFP-modified CPY, CPY was incubated with a 200-fold molar excess of DFP in buffer A at 25 °C for 1 h followed by removal of the excess reagent by gel filtration chromatography (15Jung G. Ueno H. Hayashi R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Tryptic Digestion of the CPY-IC Complex—The CPY-IC complex (140 μg) was incubated with trypsin (0.2 μg) in buffer A at 25 °C for 20 h. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed, and PMSF was added to terminate tryptic activity. The mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, native PAGE, and gel filtration analyses. Chemical Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (16Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To assay for peptidase activity, the CPY-IC complex (32.8 nm) was added to buffer A containing 1 mm CBZ-Ala-Phe-OH and various concentrations of GdnHCl. The initial rates of hydrolysis were determined at 25 °C as described previously (17Mima J. Jung G. Onizuka T. Ueno H. Hayashi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3220-3225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager RP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The system was calibrated with standard proteins that included bovine trypsinogen and horse apomyoglobin. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 476A protein sequencer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Native PAGE was performed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and the sample was prepared without either SDS or 2-mercaptoethanol. Dissociation and Activity of the CPY-IC Complex in the Presence of GdnHCl—Gel filtration of the CPY-IC complex in the presence of various concentrations of GdnHCl revealed a single peak in 1 m GdnHCl or below, but a complex elution profile was obtained in 1.5 m GdnHCl or above (Fig. 1A). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the single peak in 1 m GdnHCl or below contained both the enzyme and inhibitor (Fig. 1B). When the CPY-IC complex was mixed with glutaraldehyde, a cross-linked product with a molecular mass in excess of 97.4 kDa was detected in both the absence of GdnHCl and the presence of 1 m GdnHCl, whereas free CPY and free IC failed to cross-link in a similar experiment (Fig. 2). These experiments indicate that the complex does not dissociate into the enzyme and inhibitor in 1 m GdnHCl. When the CPY activity of the complex was assayed in the presence of GdnHCl, the activity gradually increased with increasing GdnHCl concentrations in the range of 0–1 m, indicating that the local dissociation of IC occurs around the active site of CPY of the complex in the presence of 1 m GdnHCl (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Cross-linking of the complex in 1 m GdnHCl. The complex (11 μm) in buffer A containing 0 and 1 m GdnHCl was treated with 0.01% glutaraldehyde. The reaction products were then subjected to SDS-PAGE.

The second-order reaction rate constants, k 2nd, for PMSF and PCMB were 0.85 and 0.59 min–1·mm–1, respectively, toward the complex in the presence of 1 m GdnHCl, and 0.17 and 0.087 min–1·mm–1, respectively, toward the complex in the absence of 1 m GdnHCl. Complex formation in reaction mixtures containing 1 m GdnHCl and PMSF or PCMB was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4B). The incorporation of [3H]DFP, a specific reagent for the catalytic Ser-146, into the complex increased by a factor of 10-fold more in the presence of 1 m GdnHCl than in its absence (Table I). These results indicate that the complex was partially dissociated in the presence of 1 m GdnHCl and that the catalytic Ser-146 and Cys-341 residues of CPY become uncovered or are exposed.Table IEffect of GdnHCl on the incorporation of [3H]DFP into the CPY-IC complexEnzymeIn the absence of GdnHClIn the presence of 1 m GdnHClDFP/CPYRatioDFP/CPYRatiomole/mole%mole/mole%CPY0.961000.87100CPY-IC complex0.0616.40.7080 Open table in a new tab Interaction of IC with DFP-modified CPY—Gel filtration of the mixture of DFP-modified CPY and IC showed a single peak with a similar elution profile as that of the CPY-IC complex (Fig. 5A), whereas in native PAGE analysis, the modified CPY-IC complex could be detected, but a large portion of the inhibitor dissociated from the modified enzyme (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the inhibitor is able to form the complex with DFP-modified CPY, although its binding affinity is weakened. Tryptic Digestion of the CPY-IC Complex—Tryptic digestion of the CPY-IC complex produced two peptide fragments from IC, the respective molecular sizes of which were estimated to be 20 and 10 kDa, whereas trypsin had no effect on the CPY portion of the complex, as shown in Fig. 6A. Since free IC was completely degraded by trypsin under the same conditions (Fig. 6A), the limited proteolysis of IC indicates that the IC portion in the complex assumes a more compact structure than that of free IC. Native PAGE analysis showed that both of these two fragments were able to form a complex with CPY (Fig. 6B). Complex formation of these fragments with CPY was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography in which the fragments were eluted along with CPY (Fig. 6, C and D). Amino acid sequencing showed that the N-terminal sequence of the 20-kDa fragment, defined as the C-domain, was SVPQANAYVP, consistent with the Ser-74–Pro-83 residues of IC (4Robinson L.C. Tatchell K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Bruun A.W. Svendsen I. Sørensen S.O. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3351-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analyses of the C-domain and the 10-kDa fragment, defined as the N-domain, revealed that the sizes of these masses were 16256.2 and 8164.79, respectively, which are nearly identical to the masses of the Ser-74–Lys-219 and Met-1–Lys-73 residues of IC, respectively (Fig. 7). Thus, it can be concluded that trypsin specifically cleaved the IC portion in the complex at the C-terminal of Lys-73, splitting the molecule into the N- and C-domains. Analyses of the dissociation characteristics and the activity of the CPY-IC complex indicated that in the presence of GdnHCl, the local dissociation of IC around the active site of CPY preceded its complete dissociation. This is supported by the increased reactivity of PMSF, PCMB, and DFP toward the complex in 1 m GdnHCl. Complex formation of IC with DFP-modified CPY suggests that IC possesses a binding site other than its inhibitory reactive site. Tryptic digestion of the complex revealed the presence of an interaction site in both the N-domain (residues 1–73) and the C-domain (residues 74–219) when CPY and IC form a complex. Since the N-terminal acetyl group of IC would be located adjacent to the active site of CPY in the complex (10Mima J. Kondo T. Hayashi R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that the inhibitory reactive site of IC is located in the N-domain, and the other binding site is in the C-domain. The mode of interaction of IC toward CPY appears to be different from those of other known carboxypeptidase inhibitors (19Rees D.C. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 475-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 20Marino-Buslje C. Venhudová G. Molina M.A. Oliva B. Jorba X. Canals F. Avilés F.X. Querol E. Eur. J.

IC is somewhat similar to thrombin inhibitors, the N- and C-terminal tails of which bind to the active site of thrombin in a substrate-like manner and to the exosite of the enzyme, respectively (23Grütter M.G.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 10079-10084Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple sites for CPY-IC complex formation suggests that CPY contains an exosite that interacts with its specific proteinous substrate or ligand, similar to thrombin. It has recently been reported that mouse PEBP, which shows a 25% identity to IC (Fig. 7) (4Robinson L.C. Tatchell K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Bruun A.W. Svendsen I. Sørensen S.O. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), inhibits several serine proteinases, including thrombin, although its sequence shows no significant homology with other known classes of serine proteinase inhibitors (9Hengst U. Albrecht H. Hess D. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 535-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mode of interaction of IC presented herein could be a feature that is common to all members of the PEBPs family. It is interesting to note that the residues with homology to mouse PEBP in IC were concentrated at the middle region (Leu-88–Gln-170) of the sequence, which includes the binding site of the polar head group of phosphatidylethanolamine (Fig. 7) (27Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Perry A.C. Brady R.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 1245-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 28Serre L. Vallee B. Bureaud N. Schoentgen F. Zelwer C. Structure. 1998; 6: 1255-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, considering the complex formation of the N- and C-domains of IC with CPY, the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of PEBPs probably contain binding sites that are specific for each target proteinase. In conclusion, findings concerning the properties of CPY-IC complex formation are presented. Multiple sites of the inhibitor are responsible for the tight binding to its cognate proteinase. Based on the findings herein, further studies of the interactions of IC would be useful for clarifying not only the novel mechanism involved in carboxypeptidase inhibition but the biological roles of the PEBP family as well."

Drosophila melanogaster porphobilinogen synthase (DmPBGS) is the first non-mammalian metazoan PBGS to be characterized. The sequence shows the determinants for two zinc binding sites known to be present in both mammalian and yeast PBGS, proteins that differ in the exhibition of half-of-the-sites metal binding. The pH-dependent activity of DmPBGS is uniquely affected by zinc. A tight binding catalytic zinc binds at 0.5/subunit with a K d well below μm. A second inhibitory zinc exhibits a K d of ∼5 μm and appears to bind at a stoichiometry of 1/subunit. A molecular model of DmPBGS suggests that the inhibitory zinc is located at a subunit interface using Cys-219 and His-10 as ligands. Zinc binding to this previously unknown inhibitory site is proposed to inhibit opening of the active site lid. As predicted, the DmPBGS mutant H10F is active but is not inhibited by zinc. H10F binds a catalytic zinc at 0.5/subunit and binds a second nonessential and noninhibitory zinc at 0.5/subunit. This result reveals a structural basis for half-of-the-sites metal binding that is consistent with a reciprocating motion model for function of oligomeric PBGS.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PBGS is also known as 5-aminolevulinate dehydratase or ALAD. The most significant phylogenetic difference among PBGS proteins is in the constellation of metal ions at catalytic and allosteric sites (2Jaffe E.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Jaffe E.K. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Yeast and mammalian PBGS share the sequence determinants for two zinc binding sites, one of which is absent from the PBGS of any archaea, bacteria, protist, or photosynthetic eucarya (3Jaffe E.K. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The human and yeast PBGS both contain the sequence determinants for a catalytic active site zinc (also known as ZnB), as well as a second non-essential zinc (also known as ZnA) (4Jaffe E.K. Martins J. Li J. Kervinen J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but they differ in metal binding stoichiometry. For instance, in the case of human PBGS, the catalytic zinc shows half-of-the-sites binding at a stoichiometry of 4/homo-octamer (4Jaffe E.K. Martins J. Li J. Kervinen J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Biol.

Some bacterial PBGS show half-of-the-sites metal binding at catalytic and/or allosteric sites (e.g. Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), whereas others (e.g. Escherichia coli) do not. The current sequence databases contain PBGS sequences from ∼130 different organisms. Of these, the PBGS of Drosophila melanogaster (DmPBGS) is the only complete non-mammalian and non-fungal PBGS sequence that shows the sequence determinants for the two zinc binding sites found in yeast and mammalian PBGS. The gene encoding PBGS is absent from the completed genome of Caenorhabditis elegans and not yet verified in other incomplete non-mammalian metazoan genomes such as that of Danio rerio. Hence, to help deduce the molecular determinants for expression of the half-of-the-sites metal binding phenomenon, we obtained the expressed sequence tag encoding DmPBGS and cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized the protein, as described herein. Unexpectedly, DmPBGS was found to interact with zinc somewhat differently from either mammalian or yeast PBGS. Investigation of these differences provides novel insight into the structural basis for the half-of-the-sites metal binding phenomenon. Characterization of DmPBGS is also significant because insects are among the most abundant metazoan species on earth and can act as agricultural pests or human disease vectors. For many insects, flight is essential and depends upon aerobic respiration; consequently, tetrapyrroles (hemes) play an important role. Hence, species-specific inhibition of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis might prove useful in control of insects and or insect-borne diseases. Because PBGS has recently been identified to have species-specific sensitivity to certain active site-directed inhibitors (7Kervinen J. Jaffe E.K. Stauffer F. Neier R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A.

Cloning and Expression of DmPBGS—The expressed sequence tag containing the gene for DmPBGS (catalogue number 98002) was purchased from ResGen. The gene was amplified by PCR with the addition of the NdeI and BamHI sites, using the primers 5′-GCTAAGCGAACCATATGGAGCGGAAACTGC-3′ and 5′-CGCATGTACGGATCCACATGGTATCAAGACATCGG-3′, where the restriction sites are underlined. The amplified gene was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated directly into pET17b, which had also been digested with NdeI and BamHI. The sequences of several resulting plasmids were determined throughout the gene in both directions using a series of internal and external primers. An error-free plasmid was denoted pJMPBGS and was used for further study. pJMPBGS was transformed into E. coli strain BLR(DE3) and the CodonPlus variant BL21(DE3)-RIL for expression using the procedure we had previously used for pMVhum (9Jaffe E.K.

The DmPBGS mutant H10F was prepared by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) using the sense strand primer 5′-GCACAGTGGAATGTTCCATGCCACGCTGCGGC-3′. All oligonucleotides were synthesized in the Fannie E. Rippel Biochemistry and Biotechnology Facility at Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC). DNA sequence determination was in the FCCC DNA Sequencing Core Facility. DmPBGS purification initially followed the protocol for human PBGS expressed from pMVhum (9Jaffe E.K. Volin M. Bronson-Mullins C.R. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Kervinen J. Martins J. Quinlan Jr., J.F.

The final purification protocol followed the published procedures up to the ammonium sulfate cut, which was altered to use the protein that precipitated between 30 and 50% ammonium sulfate. This protein was redissolved in 30 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 10 μm Zn2+, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% ammonium sulfate, adsorbed to a 100-ml phenyl-Sepharose column, and eluted in 2 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 10 μm Zn2+, 10 mm β-ME, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride following an 800-ml linear gradient to the final buffer. DmPBGS was pooled and applied directly to a 100-ml DEAE Biogel A column that was equilibrated in 2 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 10 μm Zn2+, 10 mm β-ME, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein was eluted with a 1-liter gradient to 0.4 m KCl in 30 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 10 μm Zn2+, 10 mm β-ME, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. DmPBGS elutes in the first third of the gradient and is baseline separated from chromosomally encoded E. coli PBGS activity that elutes in the second half of the gradient. DmPBGS was pooled, concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml, and further purified on a 1-meter long 270-ml Sephacryl S300 column in 0.1 m KPi, pH 7.0, 10 μm Zn2+, 10 mm β-ME. Dry weight analysis was used to determine the extinction coefficient of DmPBGS as previously described (10Kervinen J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Litwin S. Martins J. Scarrow R.C. Volin M. Yeung A.T. Yoon E.

These were based on the crystal structures of yeast PBGS with aminolevulinic acid bound (PDB accession number 1H7P, 1.67 Å resolution; Ref. 11Erskine P.T. Newbold R. Brindley A.A. Wood S.P.

The unit cell of the former is a monomer making a symmetric octamer, whereas the latter unit cell is an asymmetric dimer, thus making an asymmetric octamer; the models were originally built as monomer and dimer, respectively. Sequence alignments were performed with the BLAST program (12Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

All insertions and deletions in the alignment occurred in coil regions located between regular secondary structure segments. For both models, loop modeling in insertion and deletion regions in the alignment was performed with the Modeler program (version 6) (13Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A.

Side chains for residues that were identical in the DmPBGS sequence and the template proteins were kept fixed in their crystallographic Cartesian coordinates. The octamers were built using the symmetry transformations provided in the PDB entries with in-house custom software. The side chain calculations were repeated following formation of the octamer from the fundamental asymmetric units. Again, conserved amino acids were kept in their original positions. PBGS Activity Assays—Determinations of PBGS activity used a fixed-time assay at 37 °C in 0.1 m bis-tris propane-HCl, 10 mm β-ME, and the substrate 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), with variations in assay pH, concentrations of metal ions such as Zn2+, Mg2+, K+, and the Zn2+ chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline (o-phe). Procedures for pH versus activity profiles, K m and V max determinations, and inhibition by 4,7-dioxosebacic acid and 4-oxosebacic acid were as previously described (4Jaffe E.K. Martins J. Li J.

DmPBGS (10 μg/ml) activity was determined as a function of pH using a fixed assay time of 5 min, a fixed ALA concentration of 10 mm, with and without 10 μm Zn2+, 1 mm Mg2+, or 0.1 m K+. Reported pH values are final assay pH following addition of ALA-HCl. The o-phe inhibition studies were carried out such that each assay contained the appropriate amount of o-phe in 10 μl of ethanol (1% final volume). Equilibrium Dialysis Studies—Equilibrium dialysis was carried out at 37 ° for 4 h under gentle agitation in an air shaker. Protein solutions were ∼1 ml at ∼1 mg ml–1, and the dialysis buffer volume was 200 ml. Dialysis was carried out in 0.1 m bis-tris propane-HCl, 10 mm β-ME at pH 8 in the presence of 0.01–10 mm o-phe (±1 mm ALA) and in the presence of 0–30 μm Zn2+ (±1 mm ALA). Enzyme-bound zinc was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy as previously described (9Jaffe E.K. Volin M. Bronson-Mullins C.R. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Kervinen J. Martins J. Quinlan Jr., J.F.

Protein Expression and Purification—The expression of DmPBGS from pJMPBGS was attempted in E. coli strains BLR(DE3) and BL21-CodonPlus-RIL. Based on SDS gels following a small scale growth, the CodonPlus host did not appear to greatly influence expression. However, because the native gene encoding DmPBGS contains clusters of rare codons, the CodonPlus strain was selected for expression in order to minimize the possibility of translational errors. From each 1-liter growth we obtained ∼10 g of cells, from which ∼45 mg of DmPBGS was purified to homogeneity. The final purification buffer was 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7, containing 10 mm β-ME, and 10 μm Zn2+, which was originally selected because it corresponds to optimal assay conditions for mammalian PBGS. Under these conditions, purified DmPBGS has a specific activity of ∼2.5 μmol h–1 mg–1, which is an order of magnitude lower than human PBGS. Under optimal conditions for DmPBGS (see below), its specific activity is ∼17 μmol h–1 mg–1. Freshly purified DmPBGS contains 1.7 + 0.2 zinc/subunit as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Based on a dry weight analysis, DmPBGS has a 1%A280 = 0.79. Kinetic and Metal Binding Properties of DmPBGS— DmPBGS activity varies as a function of pH as illustrated in Fig. 1 and quantified in Table I. The maximal activity is observed with no added metals and peaks at ∼pH 8. Under these conditions, the pH activity profile shows a good fit to a simple bell curve with pK a = 7.2, pK b = 9.1 and a maximal velocity of 21 μmol h–1 mg–1. The addition of 0.1 m K+ or 1 mm Mg2+, which are required for, or stimulate, the activity of most other PBGS, has little effect on the pK a and pK b values, though Mg2+ appears to afford some inhibition based on V max (see Table I). The addition of 10 μm Zn2+, however, dramatically alters the profile to reveal two pK a values of 6.1 and 10.0, both of which fit best to a two-proton model. The net effect of 10 μm Zn2+ at pH values below the optimal pH of 8 is a dramatic inhibition. For comparison, at its optimal pH of ∼7, human PBGS is not inhibited by Zn2+ at concentrations below ∼30 μm (9Jaffe E.K. Volin M. Bronson-Mullins C.R. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Kervinen J. Martins J.

Open table in a new tab The K m for ALA was determined for DmPBGS at pH 8 with no added metal ions and found to be 108 + 12 μm, which is in the range of all other PBGS at their conditions of optimal pH and metal ions (e.g. 4). The V max was found to be 16.8 + 0.3 μmol h–1 mg–1. The kinetic parameters K m and V max were not quantified under other conditions of pH or buffer metal ion concentrations. Fig. 2 quantifies the effect of adding Zn2+ on the activity of DmPBGS at pH 8 and at 10 mm ALA. The data show inhibition to about 10% of maximal activity, which fit well to Equation 1. Velocity=Vmin+(Vmax-Vmin)/(1+([Zn2+]/IC50)Hillcoefficient)(Eq. 1) The resulting IC50 = 4.24 + 0.49 μm Zn2+, and the Hill coefficient is 1.51 + 0.23. It is interesting to note that the best fit to V min is 1.89 + 0.61 μmol h–1 mg–1, in excellent agreement with the plateau rate observed between pH 6.5 and 7.5 at 10 μm Zn2+ (see Fig. 1 and V max1 in Table I). To quantitatively correlate the inhibitory effect of zinc on enzyme activity with the zinc content of the protein, equilibrium dialysis studies were carried out under assay conditions in the presence and absence of 1 mm ALA in the dialysis buffer. These data are shown in Fig. 3A and quantified in Table II. The data fit well to the following simple binding in Equation 2, ZnTB=Zncat+((Znlnh×[Zn2+])/(KdZnInh+[Zn2+])),(Eq. 2) where ZnTB is total bound zinc, Zncat is the stoichiometry of a required zinc, ZnInh is the stoichiometry of an inhibitory zinc, [Zn2+] is the free Zn2+ concentration, and K dZnInh is the dissociation constant for the inhibitory zinc. Correlation of Fig. 3 with Fig. 2 indicates that under conditions where zinc does not inhibit, there are ∼0.5–0.7 zinc/subunit, which is consistent with half-of-the-sites metal binding. Under conditions where zinc shows significant inhibition of DmPBGS, the protein contains ∼1.5 zinc/subunit, suggesting that the inhibitory zinc has a stoichiometry of 1/subunit. The K dZnInh value for binding the inhibitory zinc in the presence of substrate, ∼7 μm Zn2+, is in good agreement with the kinetically determined IC50 of ∼4 μm Zn2+ (see Fig. 2).Table IIZinc binding and stoichiometry data for DmPBGS and H10FPBGSDialysis conditionsZinc/subunit corresponding to full activityZinc/subunit at maximum bindingKd for looser binding zincIC50 for o-phea[o-phe] required for 50% loss of the catalytic zinc.Hill coefficient for zincμ mmmDmPBGS[Zn2+]0.47 ± 0.031.92 ± 0.3325.4 ± 10.8bApparent K d for inhibitory zinc.1DmPBGS[Zn2+] + ALA0.69 ± 0.021.45 ± 0.066.79 ± 1.54bApparent K d for inhibitory zinc.1DmPBGS[o-phe]0.50 ± 0.040.00 ± 0.040.27 ± 0.061.7 ± 0.64DmPBGS[o-phe] + ALA0.54 ± 0.020.00 ± 0.091.03 ± 0.022.2 ± 1.3H10F[Zn2+]0.52 ± 0.061.18 ± 0.146.47 ± 3.72cApparent K d for nonessential zinc.H10F[Zn2+] + ALA0.54 ± 0.061.01 ± 0.125.72 ± 4.06cApparent K d for nonessential zinc.a [o-phe] required for 50% loss of the catalytic zinc.b Apparent K d for inhibitory zinc.c Apparent K d for nonessential zinc. Open table in a new tab To demonstrate that DmPBGS requires at least some of the tightly bound zinc that is found to co-purify with the protein, DmPBGS activity was assessed as a function of the zinc chelator, o-phe, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Maximal activity is observed at o-phe concentrations below 0.1 mm, and the inhibition profile fits best to a cooperative model where IC50 = 0.84 + 0.03 mm o-phe with a Hill coefficient of 1.9 + 0.1. To determine enzyme-bound Zn2+ as a function of o-phe equilibrium dialysis, experiments were carried out in the presence and absence of 1 mm ALA as illustrated in Fig. 3A and quantified in Table II. At low o-phe the maximal catalytic activity seen in Fig. 2 is again associated in Fig. 3A with Zn2+ bound at a stoichiometry of 0.5/subunit, confirming half-of-the-sites binding of the catalytic Zn2+. In this case, the binding data fit best to a cooperative model for o-phe inhibition (Table II). Based on the IC50 of o-phe (the amount of o-phe required to remove one-half of the catalytic zinc) in the presence and absence of the substrate ALA (1 mm versus 0.3 mm o-phe, respectively), the catalytic zinc appears to be more tightly bound in the presence of ALA than in its absence. This is consistent with a model where ALA provides some of the ligands to this required zinc ion. It is reassuring that the apparent IC50 of o-phe (1 mm) in the presence of ALA is in excellent agreement with the kinetically determined IC50 of o-phe (∼0.8 mm). The data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 show that DmPBGS binds Zn2+ differently from either human or yeast PBGS. Like the ZnB of human PBGS (4Jaffe E.K. Martins J. Li J. Kervinen J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the catalytic Zn2+ of DmPBGS shows half-of-the-sites metal binding. However, Fig. 3A suggests that the inhibitory Zn2+ of DmPBGS does not show the half-of-the-sites binding that has been seen for the non-essential ZnA of human PBGS (4Jaffe E.K. Martins J. Li J. Kervinen J. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In support of the notion that the inhibitory zinc of DmPBGS is somehow related to ZnA of yeast and mammalian PBGS, the KdZnInh of DmPBGS is of comparable magnitude to the K d for ZnA of mammalian PBGS (∼5 μm), which binds at 0.5 zinc/subunit (4Jaffe E.K.

The DmPBGS Mutant H10F—Cys-219 of DmPBGS is analogous to the cysteine that has been shown to bind the nonessential (but also non-inhibitory) ZnA of human (4Jaffe E.K. Martins J. Li J. Kervinen J.

In our model of DmPBGS, shown in Fig. 4A, Cys-219 lies very near to His-10 of a neighboring subunit, such that Cys-219 and His-10 could form part of a previously uncharacterized zinc binding site. Various PBGS crystal structures suggest that the position of Cys-219 is dependent on whether the active site lid is opened or closed. Hence, zinc binding to this site in the closed lid conformation shown in Fig. 4A could inhibit lid opening and thus inhibit catalysis. To test the hypothesis that His-10 is involved in binding the inhibitory zinc, this residue was altered to Phe, which is found in the analogous position of human PBGS. The behavior of DmPBGS mutant H10F during purification was indistinguishable from wild type DmPBGS. The yield was 75 mg from 17 g of cell paste. The specific activity of H10F at pH 8 is seen to be ∼12 μmol h–1 mg–1, only marginally lower than wild type, regardless of whether or not 10 μm Zn2+ was added to the assay mixture. The pH rate profile of H10F does not exhibit the zinc inhibition phenomenon but is otherwise the same as the wild type protein (see Fig. 1). The fitted pH rate profile data is detailed in Table I; however, for clarity of presentation only the combined fit line is illustrated in Fig. 1 (R 2 = 0.96). The behavior of H10F supports the hypothesis that inhibition by zinc is because of zinc binding through His-10 of DmPBGS. DmPBGS mutant H10F provides an independent tool for determining the stoichiometry of the inhibitory zinc of DmPBGS. To do so, the H10F protein was evaluated for its ability to bind zinc in an equilibrium dialysis experiment, the results of which are illustrated in Fig. 3B. In this case the looser binding zinc of H10F retains the K d of ∼5 μm but binds at a reduced stoichiometry of ∼0.5/subunit. Thus, H10F has lost the inhibitory zinc, which appears to have bound at a stoichiometry of 0.5/subunit. The conclusion is that DMPBGS contains the catalytic Zn2+ (akin to ZnB) at 4/octamer, contains the non-essential Zn2+ (akin to ZnA) at 4/octamer, and contains an inhibitory Zn2+ at 4/octamer. Because Cys-219 is implicated in binding both ZnA and the inhibitory zinc, the binding of these two metal ions must be mutually exclusive (see “Discussion”). Sensitivity of DmPBGS to the Species-selective Inhibitors 4,7-DOSA and 4-OSA—The differences in identity and stoichiometry of active site and allosteric metal ions for the different species of PBGS have been found to correlate with a differential susceptibility to various active site-directed inhibitors (7Kervinen J.

This is most notable for the inhibitor 4,7-dioxosebacic acid (4,7-DOSA), which we have previously characterized with PBGS from human, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Pisum sativum (pea), and B. japonicum, each of which contains a unique constellation of active site and allosteric metal ions. We find that a 100-min preincubation of DmPBGS with 4,7-DOSA over the concentration range 0.1 μm–1 mm reveals an IC50 of 9.7 ± 0.5 μm 4,7-DOSA, with a Hill coefficient of 1.5. This fit is significantly better than the fit to a simple hyperbolic equation, which gives IC50 of 9.1 ± 0.9 μm 4,7-DOSA. The DmPBGS mutant H10F exhibits a comparable IC50 of 9.6 ± 0.5 but fits quite well to a non-cooperative model. Fig. 5A puts 4,7-DOSA inhibition of DmPBGS in the context of prior studies with other species of PBGS (7Kervinen J. Jaffe E.K. Stauffer F. Neier R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8227-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The prior work suggested that sensitivity of PBGS to 4,7-DOSA is significantly enhanced by the active site zinc, and results with DmPBGS are consistent with that observation. The species-dependent inhibition pattern observed for 4-OSA was significantly different from that of 4,7-DOSA (8Jaffe E.K. Kervinen J. Martins J. Stauffer F. Neier R. Wlodawer A. Zdanov A."

RcNtrC shares some common features with Escherichia coli EcNtrC, such as the DNA binding position (i.e. where enhancer-binding proteins, EBPs, typically bind), an ATP requirement, and the nitrogen sensing and signaling mechanisms. However, differences from EcNtrC in the central domain (called region 3), the absence of ATP hydrolysis, and the fact that the RcNtrC activates the σ70 containing RNA polymerase (RNAP) rather than the σ54 containing RNAP, distinguishes RcNtrC from other EBPs in general (3Foster-Hartnett D.

The N4 single stranded-binding protein mechanism is unique in that DNA binding is not required for activation (17Miller A. Wood D. Ebright R.H. Rothman-Denes L.B. Science. 1997; 275: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). RcNtrC presents a unique system to study σ70/RNAP-EBP interactions because of the differences already noted above for this activator. Protein cross-linking and genetic techniques have been the standard to study protein-protein interactions. However, previous proposals to use heterologous activators (from Pseudomonas spp.) and E. coli RNAPs have suggested another approach to studying such interactions (18Gao J.G. Gussin G.N. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 394-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybrid RNAPs have been assembled between E. coli and, for example, Bordetella pertussis (19Steffen P. Ullmann A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and are beginning to prove useful in determining RNAP-activator protein interaction. The premise for this approach is that over hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary divergence, specific activator-RNAP interactions may coevolve. Thus determining which subunit(s) of RNAP from the natural bacterium are necessary for activation would suggest specific sites of interaction on that subunit with the activator. The α proteobacteria and E. coli (γ proteobacteria) are excellent candidates to test this approach, because they diverged more than 500 million years ago. While our study was in progress another study demonstrated that the Agrobacterium tumifaciens α subunit is required for virulence gene activation by VirG both in vivo and in vitro using a hybrid RNAP with the A. tumifaciens α subunit and E. coli β, β′, and σ70 subunits (20Lohrke S.M. Nechaev S. Yang H. Severinov K. Jin S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4533-4539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lohrke S.M. Yang H. Jin S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3704-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To date the only in vitro assembled hybrid RNAPs have been with a heterologous α subunit and E. coli β, β′, and σ70 subunits (e.g. A. tumifaciens and Sinorhizobium meliloti) (20Lohrke S.M. Nechaev S.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3808-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have successfully assembled completely recombinant R. capsulatus RNAP (Rcαββ′ωσ70) and demonstrated that its in vitro activation by RcNtrC is similar to the natural RcRNAP (5Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1884-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 2C. L. Richard, A. Tandon, and R. G. Kranz, manuscript in preparation. Based on the availability of both R. capsulatus and E. coli recombinant purified RNAP subunits and the ability to assemble functional RNAPs in vitro, we have used the hybrid RNAP to study σ70-RNAP interactions with RcNtrC. In this study, we report the successful assembly of hybrid R. capsulatus/E. coli RNAPs and the determination that the Rcβ′ subunit is necessary and sufficient for RcNtrC activation. We demonstrate that an ω subunit is essential for in vitro assembly when the Rcβ and Rcβ′ subunits are components of the reconstitution. Finally, we show that the tandem RcNtrC binding sites have strict spatial and face of the helix constraints relative to the RNAP binding site (promoter) for transcription activation. Growth Media and Strains—E. coli strains were grown in Luria broth at 37 °C and R. capsulatus was grown in the minimal medium RB (23Avtges P. Kranz R.G. Haselkorn R. Mol. Gen.

Purification of Rcα, Ecα, Crude β, and β′ Subunits, Rcσ 70, Ecσ 70, MBP-NtrB, RcNtrC, and Native RcRNAP—Purification of the His6-tagged Rcα and Ecα subunits, Rcβ, β′, Ecβ, β′, and His6-tagged Rcσ70 and Ecσ70 have been described previously (5Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1884-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 2C. L. Richard, A. Tandon, and R. G. Kranz, manuscript in preparation. Purification of the MBP-NtrB and RcNtrC has been described previously (2Cullen P.J. Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6530-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). R. capsulatus natural RNAP was isolated and purified as previously described by Cullen et al. (28Cullen P.J. Kaufman C.K. Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27266-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The native EcRNAP core and holoenzymes were purchased from Epicenter. Rcα 257 Subunit Purification—The Rcα257 subunit was purified based on a modification of the procedure of Tang et al. (25Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The His6 amino-terminal-tagged Rcα257 subunit from R. capsulatus was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) containing pRGK331 by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested at 3000 × g and sonicated in 20 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall centrifuge. By SDS-PAGE analysis, the induced supernatant contained a major polypeptide of ∼32 kDa that was not present in the uninduced sample. The volume of the supernatant was adjusted to 50 ml with buffer A and the Rcα257 subunit was precipitated by the addition of (NH4)2SO4 to 60%. The Rcα257 subunit was collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and was dissolved in 20 ml of buffer B (6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole). The sample was loaded onto a His-Bind (Novagen) column that had been washed after Ni2+ charging with buffer B and the column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B, followed by 6 column volumes of buffer C (6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole). The His6-tagged Rcα257 subunit of RNAP was eluted with 6 column volumes of buffer D (6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole) and 1-ml fractions were collected. The protein concentrations were determined with the Coomassie Plus-200 protein assay reagent (Pierce). The protein fractions were stored at –80 °C and were found to be stable for reconstitutions for up to 3 months. Ecω Subunit Purification—Carboxyl-terminal His6-tagged ω-subunit from E. coli was overexpressed in E. coli strain Tuner(DE3)pLacI containing pRGK330. The culture was grown to an A 600 of 0.6–1.0 and protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and sonicated in 20 ml of binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall centrifuge. The supernatant contained a major polypeptide of ∼10 kDa that was not present in the uninduced sample. The cleared supernatant was loaded onto a His-Bind column and the column was washed with 10 column volumes of binding buffer, followed by 6 column volumes of wash buffer (60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The His6-tagged Ecω subunit was eluted in 6 column volumes of elution buffer (250 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and 1-ml fractions were collected. The protein concentration of each fraction was determined (as above) and the fractions were stored at –80 °C for up to 3 months with no detectable loss of ability to efficiently reconstitute. Reconstitution of RNAP Hybrid Enzymes—All hybrid RNAPs were reconstituted and purified as for the recombinant reconstituted R. capsulatus holoenzyme (Rcαββ′σ70ω). 2C. L. Richard, A. Tandon, and R. G. Kranz, manuscript in preparation. The amount of RNAP subunits added per 2-ml reconstitutions are as follows: 60 μg of His6-tagged α, 300 μg of crude β, 600 μg of crude β′, 60 μg of His6-tagged ω, and 120 μg of His6-tagged Rcσ70 or Ecσ70. Combinations of R. capsulatus and E. coli RNAP subunits were combined in Snakeskin dialysis tubing (Pierce), the final reconstitution volume was brought to 2 ml. RNAPs prepared in this way were stored at –20 °C and were found to be stable for at least 3 months. In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription assays were performed as described below, according to Bowman and Kranz (5Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1884-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in a 16-μl reaction containing the transcription buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μl of RNasin (Promega)). The concentration of nifA1mut1 supercoiled template was 40 nm. For transcriptional activation 270 nm MBP-NtrB was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in transcription buffer before the simultaneous addition of 320 nm NtrC and 40 nm RNAP. The reactions were incubated for 10 min at 24 °C and start solution (50 μg/ml heparin; 0.4 mm ATP, GTP, and UTP; 0.01 mm CTP; 0.5 μl of 25 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) was added and incubation continued at 24 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 7 μl of stop solution (95% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue), heated to 70 °C for 3 min, and loaded onto an 8% acrylamide sequencing gel. Purified σ70 proteins (tagged with His6) were added to the core RNAPs prior to the start of the reactions. Other Methods—Transcripts were quantitated by digitizing the autoradiograms with a Fuji Luminescent Image Analyzer (LAS-1000 plus) and analyzing the bands by use of Fuji Image Gauge software (version 3.4). Both the digitizing and software could readily distinguish differences in transcript levels of 2-fold or more. The quantitation values indicated in parentheses are an average of the percent of nifA1mut1/RNAI for a minimum of three in vitro transcription experiments. The background was subtracted for each lane independently. α Subunit-RcNtrC Interaction Requirements—To investigate which subunits are involved in RcNtrC-mediated transcription activation, we have combined the use of the nifA1mut1 promoter (Fig. 1A) and the ability to assemble hybrid RNAPs with R. capsulatus and E. coli subunits (see below). We have demonstrated that the R. capsulatus RNAP (Rcαββ′σ70ω) can be assembled from purified recombinant subunits by a modified method of Tang et al. (25Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and that this enzyme has the same RcNtrC activation properties as the RNAP isolated from R. capsulatus.2 We chose the nifA1mut1 promoter (Fig. 1A) because of the strong RcNtrC dependence for activated transcription (e.g. compare Fig. 1, C, lane 2 with lane 4) and the extensive studies already completed on the nifA1 promoter in vivo and in vitro (5Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1884-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, the native σ70 RNAP from E. coli is not activated by RcNtrC at this promoter (3Foster-Hartnett D. Cullen P.J. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6175-6187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1884-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All of the hybrid enzymes assembled for the present study are denoted by the source organism, either R. capsulatus (Rc) or E. coli (Ec), immediately prior to the specific subunit(s) designation. All hybrid RNAPs were >95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE (e.g. Fig. 1B, lane 1). Because the RcNtrC system activates the σ70 RcRNAP and all well studied bacterial activators of this RNAP interact with the α subunit (or σ70 or both) (29Dove S.L. Hochschild A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we chose to initially reconstitute a hybrid enzyme with all E. coli subunits and the R. capsulatus α. Hybrid RNAPs were assembled with the amino-terminal His6-tagged Rcα subunit and the E. coli β and β′ subunits. As shown in Fig. 1B, RcαHis6 (∼40 kDa) was able to successfully assemble with the Ecβ and Ecβ′ (∼150 kDa) subunits as for RNAP core enzyme. RcαEcββ′ is highly active at the vector RNAI promoter when either Rcσ70 or Ecσ70 is added (Fig. 1C, lanes 14 and 15). The Ecβ subunit was originally cloned from a rifampicin-sensitive strain, whereas the Rcβ subunit in the present study was cloned from a rifampicin-resistant strain (24Yen H.C. Marrs B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 181: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, hybrid enzymes can be probed for proper composition by the use of rifampicin to inhibit transcription. The addition of rifampicin completely abolished all activity of RcαEcββ′ indicating that the rifampicin-sensitive Ecβ subunit was properly assembled (not shown). The RcαEcββ′ RNAP has the same RcNtrC activation properties as the E. coli RNAP (Fig. 1C, lanes 9 and 10 versus lanes 16 and 17), suggesting that the Rcα subunit is not sufficient to allow RcNtrC activation even when the Rcσ70 is used for promoter recognition (Fig. 1C, lane 16). No significant amount of nifA1mut1 transcript could be detected with RcαEcββ′ upon addition of RcNtrB/NtrC (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 16 and 17). As noted previously, the RcRNAP is activated by RcNtrC at this promoter (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3 compared with lanes 4 and 5). The R. capsulatus α subunit is 45% identical to the E. coli α subunit and the Rcα COOH-terminal domain (α-CTD) is separated from the Rcα NH2-terminal domain by a 17-amino acid linker. The α-CTD has been shown to be required for many σ70 RNAP activators but is not required by the σ54 type activators (11Xu H. Hoover T.R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Ebright R.H. Busby S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In E. coli it is possible to delete the α subunit CTD and maintain efficient in vitro assembly and activity of the RNAP (12Ebright R.H. Busby S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Rcα-CTD is required for RcNtrC-mediated transcription activation, we removed the Rcα-CTD (called Rcα257) and assembled this with all recombinant R. capsulatus RNAP subunits (Rcα257ββ′ωσ70). The Rcα257 mutant is hexahistidine tagged on the amino terminus and contains the 257 amino acids comprising the α-NH2-terminal domain but does not include the flexible linker or the proposed Rcα-CTD. In the presence of RcNtrB and RcNtrC an approximate 6-fold activation of the nifA1mut1 promoter is detected (Fig. 2A, lane 2), which is comparable with the activation seen with the intact Rcα (Fig. 2B, lane 2). This result supports the observation that the Rcα subunit is not required for RcNtrC-mediated activation. ω Subunit—In E. coli the ω subunit of RNAP is not required for in vitro renaturation of enzyme activity and an ω-less strain is viable, exhibiting a slow growth phenotype (30Mukherjee K. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Chatterji D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The ω subunit is evolutionarily conserved across bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (31Minakhin L. Bhagat S. Brunning A. Campbell E.A. Darst S.A. Ebright R.H. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In bacteria each of the three conserved regions of ω interacts with a different region of the β′ subunit and is proposed to function by preventing aggregation of β′, thus aiding proper folding and assembly of β′ onto the α2β subassembly, under some conditions (31Minakhin L. Bhagat S. Brunning A. Campbell E.A. Darst S.A. Ebright R.H. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 32Ghosh P. Ishihama A. Chatterji D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4621-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33Gentry D.R. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11224-11227Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in vitro assembly of the E. coli RNAP (Ecαββ′) does not require ω subunit (Fig. 3, lanes 14–16) as shown previously (e.g. Ref. 34Mukherjee K. Chatterji D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our initial studies of the Rcαββ′ assembly resulted in inactive RNAP, so we cloned and overproduced the Rcω subunit to determine whether this would aid assembly. We have previously shown that a protein of ∼23 kDa co-purifies with the RcRNAP and that this protein is the R. capsulatus ω subunit (5Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1884-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Rcω subunit is 39% identical to the E. coli ω subunit and contains the three conserved regions. The most notable difference between the R. capsulatus and E. coli ω subunits is the presence of an additional 22 amino acids on the COOH-terminal end of Rcω. Surprisingly the reconstitution of active R. capsulatus core RNAP required the ω subunit. Whereas Rcαββ′ core RNAP could not be reconstituted into a functional RNAP (e.g. Fig. 3, lane 2, RNAI transcript), when Rcω is included, transcription is observed (Fig. 3, lane 6, RNAI transcript). The addition of bovine serum albumin to the Rcαββ′ reconstitutions in amounts equivalent to or in excess to those of Rcω did not yield any transcription activity, suggesting that the Rcω subunit is specifically required. To determine whether the E. coli ω subunit can replace the Rcω subunit for assembly and RcNtrC activation, we cloned and overexpressed Ecω. The addition of the Ecω subunit to the Rcαββ′ core RNAP reconstitutions allowed assembly into an active RNAP but consistently only to a level that is 50% of the core enzyme reconstituted with the Rcω (Fig. 3, RNAI transcript, lane 6 compared with lane 10). With our in vitro reconstitution and transcription system the Ecαββ′ core RNAP reconstitutes to approximately equivalent activity levels with either the Rcω or Ecω as without the addition of any ω subunit (Fig. 3, compare RNAI transcript of lanes 16, 20, and 24). The ω subunit of RNAP, when covalently linked to a DNA-binding protein, can function as a transcription activator, presumably by its interaction with RNAP β and β′ (29Dove S.L. Hochschild A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Rcω subunit functioned specifically in protein-protein contacts with RcNtrC, we compared RcNtrC activation profiles at the nifA1mut1 promoter with RNAPs reconstituted with either Rcω or Ecω subunits. In these experiments, the σ70 subunit was added to reactions with core rather than inclusion in the assembly step. The R. capsulatus core RNAP (Rcαββ′ω) can be activated by RcNtrC on the nifA1mut1 template to a level that is comparable with that of reconstituted holoenzyme (Fig. 2B, lane 2, and Fig. 3, lane 8). When the Ecω subunit replaces the Rcω subunit for in vitro reconstitution of the Rcαββ′ core RNAP, RcNtrC-mediated activation is detected (Fig. 3, lane 12). However, the activation level consistently averages only 40% of the level seen with the Rcω (Fig. 3, lane 8 versus lane 12). The E. coli core RNAP reconstituted with Rcω is not activated by RcNtrC to a detectable level (Fig. 3, lane 20). These results suggest that the Rcω subunit is not sufficient or essential for RcNtrC transcription activation (also see below). Rcβ-RcNtrC and Rcβ′-RcNtrC Interaction—To determine whether the Rcβ and Rcβ′ subunits are sufficient for RcNtrC activation we assembled hybrid RNAPs that contained the Ecα, Rcβ, and Rcβ′ subunits, either individually or in combination with other recombinant RcRNAP subunits. The assembly requirement for the ω subunit was further defined when Rcβ and Rcβ′ are present in combination in the hybrid RNAP (Fig. 4, RNAI, lanes 4, 8, and 12). When either the Rcω or Ecω subunits are used to reconstitute EcαRcββ′, RcNtrC activation is detected (Fig. 4A, lanes 8 and 12). This result suggests that RcNtrC is interacting with the Rcβ and/or the Rcβ′ subunit(s). When the only E. coli subunit present in the hybrid enzyme is Ecβ′, no significant activation of nifA1mut1 is detected (Fig. 4B, lane 4). When only the Ecβ subunit is present in the hybrid enzyme, activation of nifA1mut1 is detected (Fig. 4C, lane 4), regardless of the σ70 used (Fig. 4C, lane 5). These results suggest that the Rcβ′ is critical for activation by RcNtrC. To confirm this, we assembled a hybrid holoenzyme where the only core subunit from R. capsulatus is Rcβ′. With this hybrid RNAP, RcNtrC-mediated transcriptional activation is observed (Fig. 4D, lane 2). These results demonstrate that the Rcβ′ subunit is sufficient to confer RcNtrC activation and that RcNtrC may interact with the Rcβ′ subunit (see “Discussion”). The Upstream Distance Requirements for Activation by RcNtrC—One of the defining characteristics of EBPs of the NtrC class is the distance from the promoter where EBP dimers bind (16Wang Y.K. Lee J.H. Brewer J.M. Hoover T.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). RcNtrC is no exception to this and in the 6 natural promoters that are activated by RcNtrC, the tandem binding sites are centered from –102 to –133 bp upstream (3Foster-Hartnett D. Cullen P.J. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6175-6187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Foster-Hartnett D. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5171-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1884-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Masepohl B. Kaiser B. Isakovic N. Richard C.L. Kranz R.G. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the case of the nifA1 promoter the activator binding sites are centered at –118 bp upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 5A). Such a spatial requirement places constraints on where RcNtrC may interact with the RNAP. The suggestion that the Rcβ′ subunit is sufficient for interaction may be a ramification of such spatial requirements (see Fig. 6 model). From similar logic, nearly all σ70/RNAP activators that interact with the α (and/or σ) subunits bind adjacent to the RNAP where face of the helix is important. We wanted to determine whether the RcNtrC tandem binding sites could be moved closer to the RNAP –35/–10 binding regions and whether the face of the helix presenting RcNtrC to RNAP is important. To determine the spatial limits for RcNtrC site placement, we constructed a defined set of insertions or deletions between the proximal RcNtrC binding site and the transcription start site of the nifA1mut1 promoter (Fig. 5, A and B). We have previously shown that both RcNtrC binding sites are required for activated transcription in vivo and in vitro (3Foster-Hartnett D. Cullen P.J. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6175-6187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bowman W.C. Kranz R.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1884-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transcription is activated to near wild type levels when the RcNtrC tandem binding sites are moved 10 bp closer (–108) to the transcription start site (Fig. 5B). However, a 5-bp deletion shows only background levels of transcription, indicating a face of the helix requirement. The optimal level of RcNtrC transcription activation occurs between –128 and –108. Both the 20-bp insertion and 20-bp deletion significantly reduce the level of activation, consistent with the limits for the RcNtrC tandem binding sites observed with the naturally occurring promoters. These results are consistent with a model whereby spatial constraints exist on how RcNtrC contacts the RcRNAP (see Fig. 6 and “Discussion”).Fig. 6Cartoon of RcRNAP-RcNtrC protein-protein interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our results with the EcαβRcβ′ωσ70 hybrid RNAP represent the first instance of the β′ subunit interacting with a bacterial DNA-binding activator protein. Currently, the only other example of an activator protein interacting with the β′ subunit is with N4 single stranded-binding protein, which does not require DNA binding for activity (17Miller A. Wood D. Ebright R.H. Rothman-Denes L.B. Science. 1997; 275: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). One caveat for the interpretation of our results is the assumption that “a requirement for activation and/or interaction” is related to a need for direct protein-protein contact. We cannot rule out a less direct interpretation, for example, recruitment occurs but the β′ subunit is specifically necessary to mediate the transcription. Verification of direct protein-protein interaction will await cross-linking and/or genetic approaches. When Rcαββ′ subunits alone were assembled, no RNAP activity could be detected. This suggested a requirement for an additional factor, most likely the ω subunit, as it is highly conserved and present in the natural RcRNAP. Unlike the in vitro assembly of core EcRNAP, in vitro assembly of the core RcRNAP absolutely requires the addition of an ω subunit. Utilizing standard genetic techniques, we have been unable to construct an ω-less (RpoZ–) R. capsulatus strain, 4C. L. Richard and R. G. Kranz, unpublished results. suggesting a specific requirement for ω for in vivo assembly of RNAP. The α subunit of RNAP has been shown to play an essential role in the transcription of many operons in E. coli and in other bacterial systems such as B. pertussis (19Steffen P. Ullmann A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Vibrio fischerii (35Stevens A.M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Greenberg E.P. J.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4533-4539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current model for activators that interact with the α-CTD indicate two requirements: the activator must bind DNA upstream of the promoter and favorable protein-protein interactions must be made. In E. coli, a fully extended flexible linker allows the α-CTD to extend ≥44 Å (12Ebright R.H. Busby S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) thus permitting Ecσ70 RNAP α-CTD to interact with the TyrR EBP at the tyrP and mtr promoters (TyrR boxes centered at –64.5 and –77.5, respectively) (38Pittard A.J. Davidson B.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 39Yang J. Camakaris H. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6389-6393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lawley B. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 238-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with a synthetic CAP-activated promoter have shown that the CAP binding sites can be moved up to 91 bp from the transcription start site and CAP activation is maintained, albeit at a significantly reduced level (∼9% of wt) (41Ushida C. Aiba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6325-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have shown that the α-CTD is not required for RcNtrC activation at the nifA1mut1 promoter. Because the RcαEcββ′ RNAP is highly active at the RNAI promoter, the most likely explanation for our results is that the proper protein-protein interactions with RcNtrC are not met by the Rcα. These results further distinguish RcNtrC σ70 RNAP activation from TyrR σ70 RNAP activation and other σ70 activators. Our results suggest a model for RcNtrC activation (Fig. 6) in which the DNA between the RcNtrC tandem binding sites and the promoter loops out (or wraps around RNAP) allowing RcNtrC to contact the Rcβ′ subunit. The significant decrease seen in RcNtrC activation with the 20-bp deletion supports spatial constraints for contacting the Rcβ′. Because we have been unable to demonstrate IHF binding or potential binding sites (3Foster-Hartnett D. Cullen P.J. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6175-6187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the fact that we see RcNtrC activation with our in vitro assembled Rcαββ′ωσ70, which is >95% pure, suggests that this looping (or wrapping) of the intervening DNA is naturally occurring. Based on our results we propose the mechanism for RcNtrC activation is recruitment, whereby RcNtrC oligomerizes at its tandem binding sites and recruits the σ70 RNAP to the promoter via an interaction with the β′ subunit.

https://openalex.org/W2079224636,"Adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP or aP2) is an intracellular fatty acid-binding protein that is found in adipocytes and macrophages and binds a large variety of intracellular lipids with high affinity. Although intracellular lipids are frequently charged, biochemical studies of lipid-binding proteins and their interactions often focus most heavily on the hydrophobic aspects of these proteins and their interactions. In this study, we have characterized the effects of KCl on the stability and lipid binding properties of ALBP. We find that added salt dramatically stabilizes ALBP, increasing its ΔG of unfolding by 3–5 kcal/mol. At 37 °C salt can more than double the stability of the protein. At the same time, salt inhibits the binding of the fluorescent lipid 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) to the protein and induces direct displacement of the lipid from the protein. Thermodynamic linkage analysis of the salt inhibition of ANS binding shows a nearly 1:1 reciprocal linkage: i.e. one ion is released from ALBP when ANS binds, and vice versa. Kinetic experiments show that salt reduces the rate of association between ANS and ALBP while simultaneously increasing the dissociation rate of ANS from the protein. We depict and discuss the thermodynamic linkages among stability, lipid binding, and salt effects for ALBP, including the use of these linkages to calculate the affinity of ANS for the denatured state of ALBP and its dependence on salt concentration. We also discuss the potential molecular origins and potential intracellular consequences of the demonstrated salt linkages to stability and lipid binding in ALBP.

Members of the iLBP family are found in a number of mammalian tissues, including liver, adipose, heart, brain, intestinal, and epithelial tissues (for reviews, see e.g. Refs. 1Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bernlohr D.A. Simpson M.A. Hertzel A.V. Banaszak L.J. Annu. Rev.

As its name suggests, ALBP is found predominantly in adipocytes, where it constitutes 1–5% of the total soluble protein. In addition, ALBP is found in macrophages, where it has been linked to the development of atherosclerosis (4Layne M.D. Patel A. Chen Y.-H. Rebel V.I. Carvajal I.M. Pellacani A. Ith B. Zhao D.

Schreiber B.M. Storch J. Feinberg M.W. Hsieh C.M. Haber E. Lee M.E. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1774-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ALBP has also been implicated in the development of type II diabetes (6Hotamisligil G.S. Johnson R.S. Distel R.J. Ellis R. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1377-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Like most iLBPs, ALBP can bind a number of fatty acids of at least 14 carbons as well as other hydrophobic ligands with carboxylate or sulfonate moieties in its large, water-filled cavity (reviewed in Ref. 4Layne M.D. Patel A. Chen Y.-H. Rebel V.I. Carvajal I.M. Pellacani A. Ith B. Zhao D. Schreiber B.M. Yet S.-F. Lee M.-E. Storch J. Perrella M.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2733-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ALBP also tightly binds the fluorescent probe 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) (7Kane C.D. Bernlohr D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Ory J.J. Banszak L.J. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ANS binds specifically in the ALBP lipid binding cavity (see Fig. 1), is a competitive inhibitor of fatty acid binding, and produces a large increase in fluorescence upon binding (7Kane C.D. Bernlohr D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Ory J.J. Banszak L.J. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Members of the iLBP family share remarkably similar tertiary structures. The iLBP fold consists of a 10-strand antiparallel β-barrel and a helix-turn-helix cap (see Fig. 1). They all possess a ligand binding cavity of ∼1000 Å3 located in the top half of the β-barrel (4Layne M.D. Patel A. Chen Y.-H. Rebel V.I. Carvajal I.M. Pellacani A. Ith B. Zhao D. Schreiber B.M. Yet S.-F. Lee M.-E. Storch J. Perrella M.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2733-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, the amino acid sequence homology between family members ranges from 23 to 69%, with 39 highly conserved residues (4Layne M.D. Patel A. Chen Y.-H. Rebel V.I. Carvajal I.M. Pellacani A. Ith B. Zhao D. Schreiber B.M. Yet S.-F. Lee M.-E. Storch J. Perrella M.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2733-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, iLBPs each have distinct surface charge potentials (10LiCata V.J. Bernlohr D.A. Proteins. 1998; 33: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ALBP has a nearly hemispherically distributed surface charge potential: mostly positively charged on the top and mostly negatively charged on the bottom (10LiCata V.J. Bernlohr D.A. Proteins. 1998; 33: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The varied charge topologies of the different iLBPs suggest that surface charge may play an important role in differentiating them in vivo. The role that surface charge plays in iLBP function has to date been predominantly characterized in a series of studies by Storch and associates (11Wootan M.G. Bernlohr D.A. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8622-8627Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Wootan M.G. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10517-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Smith E.R. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35325-35330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which examine the interactions of iLBPs with lipid vesicles. These studies have demonstrated that ALBP transfers a fluorescent fatty acid to negatively charged lipid membranes more rapidly than to neutral or positively charged membranes (12Wootan M.G. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10517-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that the transfer involves direct collision/interaction of ALBP and the vesicle (11Wootan M.G. Bernlohr D.A. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8622-8627Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Wootan M.G. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10517-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that salt attenuates the transfer reaction (12Wootan M.G. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10517-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutralizing the surface lysines of ALBP by acetylation also inhibits the ability of ALBP to form complexes with anionic vesicles (13Smith E.R. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35325-35330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that electrostatic attraction is directly involved in the mediation of ALBP-membrane interactions. In addition to the surface electrostatic topologies and the ALBP-membrane interaction studies mentioned above, a variety of other recent studies support the significance of electrostatic effects in iLBP-lipid and ANS-protein interactions. 1) Mutation of charged residues in the binding cavity of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein can change the lipid binding specificity of the protein (14Jakoby M.G. Miller K.R. Toner J.J. Bauman A. Cheng L. Li E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 2) The binding of ANS to intestinal fatty acid-binding protein has been observed to be dependent on ionic strength (I) at low NaCl concentrations, and this observation was attributed to an electrostatic screening effect (15Kirk W.R. Kurian E. Prendergast F.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 69-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). 3) Recent studies of “nonspecific” ANS surface binding to a series of different proteins using titration calorimetry concluded that most ANS molecules bind predominantly via electrostatic association and to a lesser extent via hydrophobic interactions (16Matulis D. Lovrien R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 422-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). 4) In ANS displacement assays, ALBP has been shown to bind retinoic acid, which has a carboxylate group, with moderate affinity, whereas the protein exhibits negligible affinity for retinol (7Kane C.D. Bernlohr D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas in one sense it might seem unusual to characterize electrostatic effects on interactions that are frequently considered to be predominantly hydrophobic, it is becoming increasingly clear that electrostatic effects are a major regulator of lipid-protein interactions. This has led us to investigate the effects of salt on ALBP. The results demonstrate and quantitate the regulatory effects of salt on the function and stability of ALBP. Purification of ALBP—ALBP was purified as described previously (17Xu Z. Buelt M.K. Banaszak L.J. Bernlohor D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 226: 14367-14370Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18Simpson M.A. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10980-10986Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The pRSET plasmid for overexpression of murine ALBP was a gift from Dave Bernlohr at the University of Minnesota. An extinction coefficient of 15,500 m–1 cm–1 was used to determine protein concentrations (19Matarese V. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14544-14551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was stored at –70 °C until use. Chemical Denaturations—For chemical denaturation studies, ALBP was first dialyzed extensively against appropriate buffers (10 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5, with varying KCl concentrations from 0 to 2 m). Urea stocks were deionized by stirring with AG 501-X8 deionizing resin (5 g/100 ml of solution, obtained from Bio-Rad) for 1 h in water. Urea concentrations were then determined by refractive index as described by Pace (20Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 14: 266-280Crossref Scopus (2412) Google Scholar), and the stocks were incorporated into the appropriate buffers. Stepwise chemical denaturations were performed by incubating individual aliquots of protein at 0.1–0.2 mg/ml with buffered urea for 1 h, well past the time required to reach equilibrium (data not shown). For denaturations of ALBP with ANS bound, 100 μm ANS was included in all experimental buffers. This concentration of ANS is saturating at all salt concentrations examined. Denaturation was monitored by scanning each sample in an Aviv model 202 circular dichroism spectrophotometer from 225 to 213 nm in a quartz cuvette with a 0.2-cm path length. Reversibility of ALBP unfolding was determined at high (1 m) and low (50 mm) salt concentrations by incubating ALBP in denaturing levels of urea plus salt for 1 h, followed by dialysis to remove the urea. Redenaturation was then performed, and full reversibility (recovery of the same ΔG unfolding) was obtained. Data Analysis of Denaturation Curves—The raw CD signal (in millidegrees) of each sample at 216, 217, and 218 nm was transformed into molar ellipticity (Δϵ) (21Johnson Jr., W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), and denaturation curves at each wavelength were analyzed using the nonlinear form of the linear extrapolation method (22Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Δε=(ΔεN+mN[D])+(ΔεU+mU[D])e-(ΔGN→U0/RT+mG[D]/RT)1+e-(ΔGN→U0/RT+mG[D]/RT)(Eq. 1) Here Δϵ represents the molar ellipticity at a given wavelength (the dependent variable), [D] is the molar denaturant concentration (the independent variable), ΔϵN is the y intercept of the native state base line, m N is the slope of the native state base line, ΔϵU is the y intercept of the unfolded state baseline, m U is the slope of the unfolded state base line, ΔG0N→U is the extrapolated free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and m G (the “m value”) is the slope of the calculated dependence of ΔG on [D]. Data were fit using the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Inc.). ANS Binding—The binding of ANS to ALBP was monitored using a FluoroMax-2 fluorometer. ANS concentrations in ethanol were determined using the extinction coefficient 7800 m–1 cm–1 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). ANS in buffer plus 1% ethanol was titrated into protein (in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing concentrations of KCl as noted) and using protein concentrations near 0.05 μm. Samples were incubated for 2 min with stirring, and then fluorescence was monitored with 5-nm slits and excitation and emission wavelengths of 369 and 470 nm. Fluorescence was corrected for volume increase during the titration. A corresponding titration of the background fluorescence of ANS titrated into buffer was collected and subtracted from each individual binding titration. The resulting fluorescence titrations were analyzed using a single-site binding isotherm, F=(Fmax*[ANS]/Kd)/(1+[ANS]/Kd)(Eq. 2) where F max is the maximum fluorescence obtained upon binding, [ANS] is the concentration of ANS, and Kd is the dissociation constant of ANS from ALBP. This equation assumes that the total concentration of ANS is negligibly different from the free ANS concentration, which is true when Kd ≫ [ALBP]. Fits of the isotherms with the lowest (tightest) Kd values using a quadratic solution of the binding polynomial, which does not make this assumption (23Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 24Inglese J. Blatchly R.A. Benkovic S.J. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 937-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Datta K. LiCata V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5694-5701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), yield the same Kd values within error and verify the applicability of Equation 2 to these data. The lowest (tightest) Kd values in this study, at the lowest salt concentrations, are ∼10 times higher than the [ALBP]. Data were fit using the program KaleidaGraph. It should be noted that the ANS binding activity of ALBP is extremely sensitive to storage and preparation conditions, particularly to being stored in dilute form. In all of our experiments, protein was stored at –70 °C at a concentration greater than 3 mg/ml and thawed and diluted immediately before use. Even short periods (e.g. 16 h) of incubation in dilute (<10 μm) solution at 4 °C result in a significant loss of binding affinity. In addition, the use of nitrocellulose filters for buffer preparation results in interference in the fluorescence assay. Neither of these problems affects the stability of ALBP. Salt Linkage Analysis—Linked ion release upon binding of ANS to ALBP was calculated using a basic linkage relationship (26Wyman J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 223-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 27Lohman T.M. Mascotti D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); e.g. for KCl, the relationship is as follows. {∂ln1/Kd}/{∂ln[KCl]}=Δnions=ΔnK++ΔnCl-(Eq. 3) Thus, a plot of ln(1/K dANS) versus ln [KCl] will have a slope equivalent to the net number of ions that are bound or released when ANS binds. Direct Ligand Displacement—To examine the direct displacement of ANS by salt, KCl was titrated into ANS-bound ALBP, and the decrease in fluorescence as ANS was released was recorded. A background titration of buffer added to ANS-bound ALBP was subtracted from the salt displacement data. The data were fit with a simple inverse isotherm, YI={[KCl]/IC50}/{1+[KCl]/IC50}(Eq. 4) where Y I is the normalized fluorescence, and IC50 is the concentration of salt at 50% inhibition. Stopped Flow Kinetic Analysis of ANS Binding to ALBP—Kinetics experiments were performed using a Biologic SF3 stopped flow interfaced with an ISS fluorometer. ALBP and ANS were rapidly mixed, and ANS fluorescence was monitored with excitation at 369 nm and emission at 470 nm. The assay buffer was 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% ethanol, and either 50 mm KCl or 1 m KCl. The resulting kinetic association curves were fit to the single exponential equation, F=(Fmax-F0)·(1-e-kobs(t-toffset))+F0(Eq. 5) where F is the fluorescence (dependent variable), (F max – F 0) is the amplitude of the transition, k obs is the time constant of association, t is the time after the completion of injection (independent variable), t offset is the x axis offset, which accounts for mixing time and the dead time of the instrument, F 0 is the initial fluorescence before binding, and F max is the maximum fluorescence upon completion of binding. All parameters were allowed to float except F 0, which was determined by observing the fluorescence of ANS in buffer and was then fixed during fitting. The association of ANS with ALBP is very fast, so experiments were conducted at 6 °C to minimize loss of data during the dead time (∼3 ms). For each concentration of ANS + ALBP, 5–12 shots over two different time scales (100 ms and 1 s) were averaged and collated. Using this technique, ∼50% of the full extent of reaction can be captured (less for faster processes, more for slower processes), which affords excellent precision in the determination of k obs. Determined rates are not affected by the collection time scale, but averaging and obtaining high density overlapping data throughout the complete course of the reaction significantly improves the precision of the fits. Kinetic curves were fit to both single and double exponential functions with the result that all kinetic curves were judged to be single exponential curves. It should be noted that the sensitivity of ALBP to storage conditions, described under “ANS Binding,” also appears to pertain to the kinetic behavior of the protein. Carefully handled and stored protein consistently produced well behaved single exponential kinetic curves. For determination of the association (k on) and dissociation (k off) rate constants, the relaxation time constants were plotted as a function of the sum of the equilibrium concentrations of ANS plus ALBP (28Bernasconi C.F. Relaxation Kinetics. Academic Press, Inc., 1976: 11-13Crossref Google Scholar). Equilibrium concentrations of ANS and ALBP were determined by an iterative fitting process (28Bernasconi C.F. Relaxation Kinetics. Academic Press, Inc., 1976: 11-13Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 1/τ (1/τ = k obs) is first plotted as a function of total [ANS], and the ratio between the intercept (k off) and the slope (k on) of this plot is used to calculate a dissociation constant (Kd = k off/k on). This preliminary Kd is used along with the known total concentrations of ANS and ALBP in each sample to calculate new equilibrium concentrations for ANS and ALBP, which are then used to generate a new plot of 1/τ versus [ANS]eq + [ALBP]eq. Seven to ten iterations of this procedure were sufficient to achieve excellent convergence. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, at low (50 mm) and high (1 m) KCl concentrations, in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. The sample and reference sectors of Epon charcoal-filled double-sector cells were loaded, respectively, with 110 μl of unligated or ANS-bound ALBP in low or high salt buffer and 125 μl of the corresponding buffer. For the runs in the presence of ANS, the reference sector also contained ANS, the ANS concentration was ∼100 μm, and the samples contained 1% ethanol. Runs were performed at 20 °C and 25,000 rpm for ∼24 h. Absorbance was measured at 279 nm for unligated ALBP and 281 nm for ANS-bound ALBP. The ALBP concentration was 0.2 mg/ml. Data were analyzed using the Origin equilibrium analysis program in the Beckman analysis software package. Values of the partial specific volume of ALBP and the densities of the buffer solutions at 20 °C were calculated using the computer program SEDNTERP (available on the World Wide Web at biochem.uthscsa.edu/auc/software). Fitting data to models of higher oligomeric complexity did not reveal any contaminants or additional equilibria and confirmed that the data depict an ideal single species in solution. Salt Significantly Stabilizes ALBP—Native ALBP displays a CD spectrum typical of a protein predominantly consisting of β-sheet. Fig. 2A shows the change in the CD spectrum as urea unfolds the protein. The largest spectral changes occur in the β-sheet trough around 217 nm, so for each denaturation the signals at wavelengths of 216, 217, and 218 nm were individually analyzed and averaged to obtain values for ΔG unfolding as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2B shows representative denaturation curves for ALBP in different solution conditions. Urea denaturations of apo-ALBP at 25 °C as a function of added KCl reveal a significant (3 kcal/mol) salt-induced stabilization of the protein as the salt concentration is increased from 0 to 2 m (Table I). The salt stabilization effect on apo-ALBP appears to be mostly saturated at KCl concentrations above 250 mm. Measurements of the ΔG unfolding at 37 °C in the presence and absence of 2 m KCl also show a significant (5.1 kcal/mol) salt-induced stabilization of ALBP. Thus, at 37 °C, the addition of 2 m salt more than doubles the stability of the protein. This is an extremely large salt-induced protein stabilization.Table IΔGunfolding of ALBP with increasing KCl (in kcal/mol)[KCl]apo-ALBP, 25 °Capo-ALBP, 37 °CANS-bound ALBP, 25 °CaIn all ANS-bound ALBP denaturations, the concentration of ANS was 100 μm.mm04.8 ± 0.84.0 ± 1.09.7 ± 2.0504.8 ± 0.68.7 ± 1.12506.8 ± 0.77.1 ± 1.05006.7 ± 0.76.7 ± 0.910006.7 ± 0.46.8 ± 0.720007.8 ± 0.99.1 ± 1.4a In all ANS-bound ALBP denaturations, the concentration of ANS was 100 μm. Open table in a new tab Salt Appears to Destabilize Lipid-bound ALBP—In contrast to the effect of salt on apo-ALBP, ANS-bound ALBP appears to be destabilized by KCl. At 0 mm KCl, ANS-bound ALBP has a free energy of unfolding of 9.7 kcal/mol. Additional stabilization relative to the apoprotein is expected from the contribution of the ANS binding energy. The binding of any ligand to a protein will stabilize it. However, instead of exhibiting a pattern of stabilization paralleling the apoprotein (offset by the added ΔG binding of ANS), the holoprotein appears to become destabilized as salt is added. In general, the denaturation curves are less well behaved at high ANS concentrations, and this leads to higher propagated errors on the determined free energies. This situation results in significant overlap of the fitted ΔG unfolding values in the presence of bound ANS (Table I). However, although the error envelopes overlap, the low salt data cannot be fit using the high salt value of ΔG unfolding (6.8 kcal/mol), and the high salt data cannot be fit using the low salt value of ΔG unfolding (9.7 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the data clearly and statistically significantly indicate that unlike the case for apo-ALBP, the ΔG unfolding for holo-ALBP is not increasing with added salt. As discussed below, direct lipid binding experiments were conducted, which demonstrate that a major source (but not the sole source) of this effect is the salt-induced displacement of ANS from the protein. Thermodynamic linkage calculations indicate that this effect is coupled with a salt-induced increase of the affinity of ANS for the denatured state of ALBP. The combination of these two effects produces the observed results and results in the observed convergence of the stabilization energies for the apo- and holoproteins at higher salt concentrations (see “Thermodynamic Linkages among Stability, Ligand Binding, and Salt”). All of the unfolding data fit well to a two-state denaturation model (Equation 1). It is, however, possible that the observed stabilization is the result of a salt-induced shift between a two-state unfolding process and a three-state unfolding process (which would have a lower apparent ΔG unfolding when analyzed as a two-state process). If this were true, however, the shift for the apoprotein would have to be three-state to two-state with added salt, whereas the shift for holoprotein would have to be two-state to three-state. Salt Inhibits Lipid Binding to ALBP and Causes Lipid Release—Equilibrium binding of ANS to ALBP was measured using the intrinsic fluorescence increase of ANS upon binding. ANS binds specifically in the lipid binding cavity of ALBP (4Layne M.D. Patel A. Chen Y.-H. Rebel V.I. Carvajal I.M. Pellacani A. Ith B. Zhao D. Schreiber B.M. Yet S.-F. Lee M.-E. Storch J.

Biochem. 1996; 233: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows representative titrations at different KCl concentrations. Binding as a function of increased salt reveals that KCl weakens the association between ANS and ALBP. The Kd of ANS binding to ALBP increases from 0.48 to 4.4 μm upon increasing the KCl concentration from 50 to 750 mm (see Fig. 3 and Table II).Table IIANS-ALBP binding as a function of KCl[KCl]KdΔGmmμ mkcal/mol500.48 ± 0.148.62 ± 2.541501.37 ± 0.057.99 ± 0.292501.21 ± 0.438.07 ± 2.885002.27 ± 0.207.69 ± 0.677504.40 ± 0.077.30 ± 0.12 Open table in a new tab A thermodynamic linkage analysis of these data is also shown in Fig. 3. The slope of a plot of ln [salt] versus ln(1/Kd) provides an estimate of the net uptake or displacement of ions upon ligand binding (26Wyman J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 223-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 27Lohman T.M. Mascotti D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that there exists a thermodynamic linkage of ∼0.8 ions released upon binding of ANS. In other words, ANS binding causes the dissociation of essentially one monovalent ion from ALBP. Since thermodynamic linkages must be reciprocal, adding salt to holo-ALBP must also displace bound ligand. The salt-induced dissociation of ANS from ALBP was confirmed by titrating KCl into ANS-bound ALBP and observing the concomitant loss of fluorescence as the ANS dissociated (Fig. 3C). Note that ANS still binds to ALBP at high salt (Table II and data not shown), so Fig. 3C does not represent 100% displacement of ANS from the protein but shows a salt-induced equilibrium shift at one concentration of ANS. Analysis of the salt-induced displacement of ANS with a simple inverse isotherm (Equation 2), representing competitive inhibition, yields an IC50 value of 172 mm KCl.
