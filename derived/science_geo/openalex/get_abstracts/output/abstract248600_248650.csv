https://openalex.org/W2148994713,"We sequenced 28 million base pairs of DNA in a metagenomics approach, using a woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) sample from Siberia. As a result of exceptional sample preservation and the use of a recently developed emulsion polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing technique, 13 million base pairs (45.4%) of the sequencing reads were identified as mammoth DNA. Sequence identity between our data and African elephant (Loxodonta africana) was 98.55%, consistent with a paleontologically based divergence date of 5 to 6 million years. The sample includes a surprisingly small diversity of environmental DNAs. The high percentage of endogenous DNA recoverable from this single mammoth would allow for completion of its genome, unleashing the field of paleogenomics."

https://openalex.org/W2169658842,"Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin-like receptor on leukocytes that mediates phagocytosis and inflammatory mediator production in innate immunity to fungal pathogens. Dectin-1 lacks residues involved in calcium ligation that mediates carbohydrate-binding by classical C-type lectins; nevertheless, it binds zymosan, a particulate β-glucan-rich extract of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and binding is inhibited by polysaccharides rich in β1,3- or both β1,3- and β1,6-linked glucose. The oligosaccharide ligands on glucans recognized by Dectin-1 have not yet been delineated precisely. It is also not known whether Dectin-1 can interact with other types of carbohydrates. We have investigated this, since Dectin-1 shows glucan-independent binding to a subset of T-lymphocytes and is involved in triggering their proliferation. Here we assign oligosaccharide ligands for Dectin-1 using the neoglycolipid-based oligosaccharide microarray technology, a unique approach for constructing microarrays of lipid-linked oligosaccharide probes from desired sources. We generate “designer” microarrays from three glucan polysaccharides, a neutral soluble glucan isolated from S. cerevisiae and two bacterial glucans, curdlan from Alcaligenes faecalis and pustulan from Umbilicaria papullosa, and use these in conjunction with 187 diverse, sequence-defined, predominantly mammalian-type, oligosaccharide probes. Among these, Dectin-1 binding is detected exclusively to 1,3-linked glucose oligomers, the minimum length required for detectable binding being a 10- or 11-mer. Thus, the ligands assigned so far are exogenous rather than endogenous. We further show that Dectin-1 ligands, 11-13 gluco-oligomers, in clustered form (displayed on liposomes), mimic the macromolecular β-glucans and compete with zymosan binding and triggering of tumor necrosis factor-α secretion by a Dectin-1-expressing macrophage cell line.

It is now known to be also expressed at the surface of monocytes and neutrophils and at low levels on a subpopulation of T-cells (5Taylor P.R. Brown G.D. Reid D.M. Willment J.A. Martinez-Pomares L.

Studies of the tissue distribution of the murine Dectin-1 by immunohistochemistry have shown it to be expressed in the spleen, thymus, liver, lung, and gut and at low levels in the skin, but it is not detectable in the brain, heart, kidney, or eye (6Reid D.M.

Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) but resembles those of natural killer cells in its lack of residues involved in the ligation of calcium that mediates carbohydrate binding in the classical lectins (3Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Shikano S. Xu S. Ritter III, R. Kumamoto T. Edelbaum D. Morita A. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Biol.

The cell membrane-associated Dectin-1 nevertheless binds to zymosan, a particulate β-glucan-rich extract derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the binding to zymosan is inhibited by soluble glucan polysaccharides, such as laminarin and a S. cerevisiae glucan solubilized by partial phosphorylation (referred to as glucan phosphate (4Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 8Willment J.A. Gordon S. Brown G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43818-43823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)). The common feature of the glucan polysaccharides that inhibit Dectin-1 binding is the presence of β1,3-linked or both β1,3- and β1,6-linked glucose. The β-glucan binding has been shown to be mediated by the lectin-like domain (12Adachi Y. Ishii T. Ikeda Y. Hoshino A. Tamura H. Aketagawa J. Tanaka S. Ohno N. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4159-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and is independent of calcium (4Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 8Willment J.A. Gordon S. Brown G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43818-43823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Intact yeasts, including S. cerevisiae and the fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Pneumocystis carinii, are also recognized by Dectin-1 in a glucan-dependent fashion (4Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 13Steele C. Marrero L. Swain S. Harmsen A.G. Zheng M. Brown G.D. Gordon S. Shellito J.E. Kolls J.K. J. Exp.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). β-Glucans are homopolymers of d-glucose that have for long been used as anti-infective and anti-tumor drugs due to their ability to stimulate in vivo the phagocytic activity of leukocytes and to trigger the production of reactive oxygen species and of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, such as TNF-α (2Herre J. Willment J.A. Gordon S. Brown G.D. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 24: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Bohn J.A. BeMiller N. Carbohydr.

Dectin-1 is now thought to be the major receptor on leukocytes that mediates the biological effects of β-glucans as immune cell activators (1Brown G.D. Herre J. Williams D.L. Willment J.A. Marshall A.S. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 17Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Reid D.M. Willment J.A. Williams D.L. Martinez-Pomares L. Wong S.Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). These cellular responses to β-glucans require the cytoplasmic tail and the ITAM-like domain of Dectin-1, and some of them involve collaboration with other signaling molecules, such as the Toll-like receptor, TLR-2, and the myeloid differentiation factor 88 known as Myd 88 (1Brown G.D. Herre J. Williams D.L. Willment J.A. Marshall A.S. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 18Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Canavera S.J. Akira S. Underhill D.M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Dectin-1 also mediates the internalization of intact yeasts and fungal pathogens (13Steele C. Marrero L. Swain S. Harmsen A.G. Zheng M. Brown G.D. Gordon S. Shellito J.E. Kolls J.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 19Herre J. Marshall A.S.J. Caron E.

This requires the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic ITAM-like motif, although downstream signaling cascades involved in the mechanism of uptake of the pathogens are different from that of the known phagocytic receptors (19Herre J. Marshall A.S.J. Caron E. Edwards A.D. Williams D.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Reis e Sousa C. Gordon S. Brown G.D. Blood. 2004; 104: 4038-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). These findings implicate Dectin-1 as a pattern recognition receptor (20Gordon S. Cell. 2002; 111: 927-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) for nonopsonized glucans on fungi that is involved in the control of these pathogens by the innate immune system. The oligosaccharide ligands on glucans recognized by Dectin-1 have not yet been delineated precisely. It is also not yet known whether Dectin-1 can interact with other types of carbohydrates. This is important to investigate, since it is known that, in addition to binding to glucans, Dectin-1 binds to a subset of T-lymphocytes and is involved in triggering the proliferation of these cells (3Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Shikano S. Xu S. Ritter III, R. Kumamoto T. Edelbaum D. Morita A. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20157-20167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 4Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). The T-cell binding is not inhibited by glucans (4Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 8Willment J.A. Gordon S. Brown G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43818-43823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and the ligand(s) on T-cells remain to be identified (4Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 8Willment J.A. Gordon S. Brown G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43818-43823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the oligosaccharide ligands for Dectin-1 using the neoglycolipid (NGL)-based oligosaccharide microarray technology (21Fukui S. Feizi T. Galustian C. Lawson A.M. Chai W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 22Feizi T. Chai W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), a unique approach for constructing microarrays of lipid-linked oligosaccharide probes from desired sources. Our approach is to first select ligand-positive and -negative β-glucans, to partially fragment these and chemically link the oligosaccharide fragments to a lipid; the NGL probes thus generated are arrayed and used for Dectin-1 binding studies in conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS) and methylation analysis for chain length and sugar linkage assignments. Second, we use purified glucan fragments to examine their abilities to compete with the binding of zymosan to Dectin-1-expressing macrophages and the triggering of the secretion of the cytokine TNF-α by zymosan. Third, using glucan oligosaccharide ligands as positive controls, we evaluate Dectin-1 binding to microarrays that include almost 200 sequence-defined oligosaccharide probes, many of which are of the mammalian type. Materials—The polysaccharides examined in this investigation, the predominant carbohydrate sequences reported in these, and their sources are given in Table 1. A mixture of oligosaccharide fragments of the polysaccharide curdlan, obtained by acid hydrolysis, was from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). Laminari-hexaose and -heptaose, composed of β1,3-linked glucose, were from Megazyme and Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA), respectively.TABLE 1Polysaccharides examined in this investigation and their reported propertiesPolysaccharideMean molecular massaWhere known.Predominant oligosaccharide sequencesSourceReferencekDaPGG glucan, from S. cerevisiae120-205β1,3-Glc with β1,6-branchesBiothera43NSG glucan, from S. cerevisiae10-20Biothera44Pustulan, from Umbilicaria papullosa20β1,6-GlcCalbiochem33Laminarin, from Laminaria digitata7.7β1,3-Glc with β1,6-branchesSigma45Lichenan, from Icelandic mossβ1,3- and β1,4-GlcMegazyme46Barley glucan190β1,3- and β1,4-GlcSigma47Dextran500α1,6-Glc with 5% α1,3-branchesAmersham Biosciences48Pullulan, from Pullularia pullulansα1,4- and α1,6-GlcMegazyme47Mannan, from S. cerevisiaeα1,6-ManSigma49a Where known. Open table in a new tab Recombinant Soluble Dectin-1—A soluble Dectin-1-human IgG Fc chimera (Fc-Dectin-1) was generated by cloning the extracellular domain of murine Dectin-1 into the pSecTag2C plasmid containing a mutated Fc portion of human IgG1 (23Ettinger R. Browning J.L. Michie S.A. van E.W. McDevitt H.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13102-13107Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This construct was transfected into HEL293T cells, and the protein was purified from the supernatant by protein A chromatography. Cells—The RAW264.7 cells transduced with full-length hemagglutinin-tagged Dectin-1 have been described previously (1Brown G.D. Herre J. Williams D.L. Willment J.A. Marshall A.S. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing full-length Dectin-1 were generated by retroviral transduction, essentially as for the RAW264.7 cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Ham’s F-12 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Gibco). Depolymerization of Polysaccharides and Fractionation of the Oligosaccharide Fragments—Partial depolymerization of the neutral soluble glucan (NSG) isolated from S. cerevisiae was carried out by hydrolysis in 10 mm HCl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 100 °C for 2 h followed by neutralization with NaOH. Fragmentation of pustulan was performed by acetolysis with a solution of acetic anhydride/glacial acetic acid/concentrated H2SO4 (10:10:1 by volume) at 40 °C for 30 min. After stopping the reaction by neutralizing with anhydrous pyridine, the acetyl groups were removed by sodium methoxide (0.5 m in methanol at room temperature for 30 min). A further hydrolysis step with 0.1 m aqueous NaOH was introduced, for 30 min at ambient temperature, to ensure removal of residual acetyl groups detected by mass spectrometry. The product was neutralized with 10 mm HCl. The pustulan acetolysate and the NSG hydrolysate were desalted using a short Sephadex G10 column (1.6 × 30 cm) eluted with deionized water at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. Fractionation of Oligosaccharides—The curdlan hydrolysate was pre-fractionated by ultrafiltration using a membrane (molecular weight cut-off 1000; Millipore, Watford, UK), and the retentate was investigated. The curdlan retentate, NSG hydrolysate, and pustulan acetolysate oligosaccharides were fractionated on a column of Bio-Gel P6 (1.6 × 90 cm) eluted with deionized water at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. The eluates were monitored on-line by refractive index and pooled according to their predominant glucose units, 7- to 13-mers, determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS, and lyophilized. Quantitation of oligosaccharides in the pooled fractions was carried out by a dot-orcinol assay using glucose as the standard, as described (24Chai W. Feizi T. Yuen C.-T. Lawson A.M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Aliquots of each fraction (2 μg of hexose) were analyzed by high performance TLC (HPTLC) using a solvent system of n-propanol/water (8:3 by volume), developed twice, and stained with orcinol reagent. Oligosaccharide Purification—NSG oligosaccharide fractions of interest, obtained by Bio-Gel P6 chromatography, were further separated into a, b, and c subfractions by preparative HPTLC using aluminum-backed plates, 10 × 10 cm (Merck), and the solvent system n-propanol/water (8:3 by volume), developed twice. Isolation of selected oligosaccharides was carried out by HPLC after conversion of oligosaccharide fractions into their aminopyridine derivatives as described (25Her G.R. Santikarn S. Reinhold V.N. Williams J.C. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1987; 6: 129-139Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The derivatization was without reduction in order to recover the reducing oligosaccharides after chromatography (25Her G.R. Santikarn S. Reinhold V.N. Williams J.C. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1987; 6: 129-139Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A Hypersil amino column, APS-2 (4.6 × 250 mm; Thermo Electron, Runcorn, UK), and a solvent system of a water/acetonitrile gradient were used for fractionation, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, with detection at UV 247 nm. The collected oligosaccharide-2-aminopyridine derivatives were monitored by MALDI MS and converted back into the reducing forms by acid hydrolysis, 1 m AcOH at 70 °C, 16 h prior to conversion to NGLs or methylation analysis as described below. Preparation and Purification of NGL Probes—Fluorescent NGLs were prepared as described (26Stoll M.S. Feizi T. Loveless R.W. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Yuen C.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) by chemical conjugation of oligosaccharides to the amino phospholipid N-aminoacetyl-N-(9-anthracenyl methyl)-1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (ADHP) with the following modifications. To the lyophilized oligosaccharide fraction (typically 100 nmol) were added 5 μl of water, 100 μl of a solution of ADHP (10 nmol/μl) in chloroform/methanol (1:3 by volume), and 20 μl of a fresh solution of the reducing agent tetrabutylammonium cyanoborohydride (20 μg/μl in methanol). The mixture was incubated at 75 °C for 72 h. For oligosaccharides higher than 9-mers, additional reagents (2.5 μl of water, 50 μl of ADHP solution, and 10 μl of reducing agent) were added after 24 h of incubation. The NGLs were visualized under UV light at 254 nm. The excess reagents in the reaction mixtures were removed (27Chai W. Stoll M.S. Galustian C. Lawson A.M. Feizi T.

Methylation Analysis—Oligosaccharides were reduced with NaBD4 before they were methylated, hydrolyzed, reduced, and acetylated as described (29Chai W.G. Hounsell E.F. Cashmore G.C. Rosankiewicz J.R.

Gas chromatography-MS analysis of the products, partially methylated alditol acetates, was performed on a ThermoQuest Trace system (Thermo Electron, Hemel Hempstead, UK), using a 15-m RTX-5 capillary column (Hewlett-Packard). The initial column temperature was 50 °C programmed to 100 °C at 25 °C/min, to 220 °C at 5 °C/min, and to 310 °C at 10 °C/min. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI MS was carried out on a Tof Spec-2E instrument (Waters, Manchester, UK). Oligosaccharides and NGLs were dissolved in methanol and chloroform/methanol/water (25:25:8 by volume), respectively, at a concentration of 10-20 pmol/μl, and 0.5 μl was deposited on the sample target together with a matrix of 2-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzoic acid. Laser energy was 20% (coarse) and 60% (fine), and resolution was at 1000. Interactions of Soluble Dectin-1 with Polysaccharides—Polysaccharides in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), were added to polystyrene wells (96-well Immulon 4 plates; Dynex Technologies Ltd., Worthing, UK) and allowed to dry at 37 °C for 16 h. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% (w/v) casein in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, from Pierce), referred to as Pierce Blocker solution. Fc-Dectin-1 was used at 1 μg/ml, and the binding was detected using biotinylated goat anti-human IgG heavy and light (H + L) chains (anti-IgG) from Vector Laboratories (Peterborough, UK) (10 μg/ml), followed by streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase from Pierce (5 μg/ml) and colorimetric measurement (490 nm) using O-phenylenediamine hydrochloride (Sigma) as substrate. Variables investigated in initial experiments were (a) binding signals using Fc-Dectin-1 noncomplexed or precomplexed with the biotinylated anti-IgG, Dectin-1 (anti-IgG ratio 1:3 by weight) (30Galustian C.

For inhibition studies, NSG, used as the reference immobilized ligand (10 μg/ml in PBS), was added to wells and allowed to dry at 37 °C for 16 h. The Dectin-1 was used at the nonsaturating concentration of 0.5 μg/ml.

One hundred μl of cell suspension and 10 μl of 2A11 (1:5 working dilution) were added to Falcon 2054 tubes (BD Biosciences) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C (all subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C). The cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 and incubated for 30 min with 50 μl of goat anti-rat-RPE at a 1:5 working dilution. The cells were then washed twice and fixed with 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Staining of the cells was detected using a FACSCalibur cell sorter (BD Biosciences).

https://openalex.org/W2112215733,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a potent angiogenic inhibitor. Reduced PEDF levels are associated with diabetic retinopathy. However, the mechanism for the protective effects of PEDF against diabetic retinopathy (DR) is presently unclear. As inflammation plays a role in DR, the present study determined the effect of PEDF on inflammation. Western blot analysis and ELISA demonstrated that retinal and plasma PEDF levels were drastically decreased in rats with endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU), which suggests that PEDF is a negative acute-phase protein. Intravitreal injection of PEDF significantly reduced vascular hyper-permeability in rat models of diabetes and oxygen-induced retinopathy, correlating with the decreased levels of retinal inflammatory factors, including VEGF, VEGF receptor-2, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, and ICAM-1. In cultured retinal capillary endothelial cells, PEDF significantly decreased TNF-alpha and ICAM-1 expression under hypoxia. Moreover, down-regulation of PEDF expression by siRNA resulted in significantly increases of VEGF and TNF-alpha secretion in retinal Müller cells. These findings suggest that PEDF is a novel endogenous anti-inflammatory factor in the eye. The decrease of ocular PEDF levels may contribute to inflammation and vascular leakage in DR."
https://openalex.org/W2140237162,"We report three new structures of mitochondrial respiratory Complex II (succinate ubiquinone oxidoreductase, E.C. 1.3.5.1) at up to 2.1 A resolution, with various inhibitors. The structures define the conformation of the bound inhibitors and suggest the residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis at the dicarboxylate site. In particular they support the role of Arg(297) as a general base catalyst accepting a proton in the dehydrogenation of succinate. The dicarboxylate ligand in oxaloacetate-containing crystals appears to be the same as that reported for Shewanella flavocytochrome c treated with fumarate. The plant and fungal toxin 3-nitropropionic acid, an irreversible inactivator of succinate dehydrogenase, forms a covalent adduct with the side chain of Arg(297). The modification eliminates a trypsin cleavage site in the flavoprotein, and tandem mass spectroscopic analysis of the new fragment shows the mass of Arg(297) to be increased by 83 Da and to have the potential of losing 44 Da, consistent with decarboxylation, during fragmentation."

These data suggest the essential role of four ESCRT complexes in multivesicular body protein sorting. However, the putative mammalian ESCRTII complex (hVps25p, hVps22p, and hVps36p) has no proven functional role in endosomal transport. We have characterized the human ESCRTII complex and investigated its function in endosomal trafficking. The human ESCRTII proteins interact with one another, with hVps20p (a component of ESCRTIII), and with their yeast homologues. Our interaction data from yeast two-hybrid studies along with experiments with purified proteins suggest an essential role for the N-terminal domain of hVps22p in the formation of a heterotetrameric ESCRTII complex. Although human ESCRTII is found in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, it can be recruited to endosomes upon overexpression of dominant-negative hVps4Bp. Interestingly, we find that small interference RNA depletion of mammalian ESCRTII does not affect degradation of epidermal growth factor, a known cargo of the multivesicular body protein sorting pathway. We also show that depletion of the deubiquitinating enzymes AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM (signal transducing adaptor molecule)) and UBPY (ubiquitin isopeptidase Y) have opposite effects on epidermal growth factor degradation, with UBPY depletion causing dramatic swelling of endosomes. Down-regulation of another cargo, the major histocompatibility complex class I in cells expressing the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus protein K3, is unaffected in ESCRTII-depleted cells.

Proteins included on the internal membranes are typically destined for the lysosome lumen, although in specialized cells containing secretory lysosomes the internal vesicles may be secreted from the cell. Proteins remaining on the outer MVB membrane are recycled to other compartments or transported to the limiting lysosome membrane. The sorting of proteins into the internal vesicles of MVBs is important for many essential cellular processes, including the down-regulation of growth factor receptors and antigen presentation. In addition, it has now become apparent that viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus and Ebola virus exploit the cellular machinery required for MVB protein sorting for use in viral budding (for reviews, see Refs. 1Raiborg C.

Over the last few years, significant progress has been made in identifying the signals and machinery involved in protein sorting into the luminal vesicles of MVBs. Much of this information has come from studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The majority of yeast proteins studied so far use ubiquitin attached to their cytosolic domain as an MVB sorting signal, although there is also a ubiquitin-independent pathway (5Katzmann D.J.

As well as identification of a sorting signal, yeast studies have provided the first clues to the molecular machinery of MVB protein sorting. Genetic screens in yeast identified 18 genes, the “class E” vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes, which encode proteins involved in MVB protein sorting (8Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A.

Deletion of any class E VPS gene results in the secretion of the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y and the formation of a large, aberrant endosomal compartment in which proteins en route to the vacuole (the yeast lysosome) accumulate. 17 of the class E VPS genes encode soluble or peripherally membrane-associated proteins, 12 of which form 4 endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT complexes 0, I, II, and III, see Table 1), and the remaining 5 are directly or indirectly associated with ESCRTIII (5Katzmann D.J.

Yeast ESCRTII is also capable of binding ubiquitin via an NZF motif in Vps36p, and thus the ubiquitinated cargo may be passed to ESCRTII en route to the luminal vesicles (22Alam S.L. Sun J. Payne M.

Mammalian homologues of all the soluble yeast class E Vps proteins have now been identified (see Table 1 for homologues of the ESCRT proteins) and have in some cases been shown to perform similar functions to their yeast counterparts. For example, components of ESCRTI (TSG101, hVps28p, and hVps37Ap) are involved in mammalian MVB protein sorting (28Bache K.G. Slagsvold T. Cabezas A. Rosendal K.R. Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Mol. Biol.

However, nothing is currently known about the role of the putative mammalian ESCRTII complex in endosomal sorting. The yeast ESCRTII complex is made up of two copies of Vps25p, and one each of Vps22p and Vps36p, and the structure of the core (i.e. without the N-terminal 395 amino acids of Vps36p) has been solved by x-ray crystallography at a resolution of 3.6 Å (31Teo H.

Evidence that human ESCRTII is found on endosomes comes from the finding that hVps25p colocalizes with overexpressed hVps20p on punctate endosomal structures, and hVps36p coexpressed with hVps25p in cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) colocalizes with endosomal markers (39Yorikawa C.

We have investigated the role of the putative mammalian ESCRTII complex in MVB protein sorting in mammalian cells. hVps25p, hVps22p, and hVps36p interact with one another and with their yeast homologues. In addition, hVps25p can associate with endosomes in the presence of a dominant-negative mutant of hVps4Bp. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that mammalian ESCRTII plays a role in MVB protein sorting. Plasmid Construction—Enzymes used in DNA manipulations were purchased from New England Biolabs Ltd., except Pfu turbo DNA polymerase, which was obtained from Stratagene Europe. DNA oligo-nucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Genosys Ltd. All constructs were fully sequenced, either at the Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, or the MRC geneservice (Hinxton, England). hVPS25 was amplified from IMAGE clone 3614824 (MRC geneservice), and the PCR product was inserted into pCRblunt II (Invitrogen). hVPS25 was then re-amplified to insert an EcoRI site before the start codon and a SalI site after the stop codon. These sites were used to subclone hVPS25 into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for expression of GST fusion protein in bacteria or pGBDU-C3 and pGAD-C3 (41James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for yeast two-hybrid analysis. For the expression of His6-tagged Vps25p in bacteria, full-length hVPS25 was amplified with an NdeI site before the start codon and an EcoRI site after the stop codon and subcloned using these sites into the plasmid pMW172H6. To create hVps25p with an N-terminal green fluorescent tag, hVPS25 was re-amplified to generate a BglII site before the start codon and an EcoRI site after the stop codon for sub-cloning into pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences). hVPS22 was amplified from IMAGE clone 3452153 and subcloned into pGBDU-C3 and pGAD-C3 as described for hVPS25. The IMAGE clone sequence of hVPS22 and our sequence were identical, but differed in 1 base from the published sequence of hVPS22 (33Kamura T. Burian D. Khalili H. Schmidt S.L. Sato S. Liu W.J.

This change alters one amino acid: our sequence has Ala at 250 and the published sequence has Pro. Upon aligning our sequence with Vps22p sequences from several organisms, we found that Ala was present in the mouse protein at this position. We therefore decided not to mutate this residue in our sequence. To generate the N-terminal fragment of hVps22p for two-hybrid analysis, bp 1-243 of hVPS22 were amplified by PCR with an EcoRI site before the start codon, and a stop codon engineered after base pair 243 followed by a SalI site. These restriction sites were used to subclone the fragment into plasmids pGBDU-C3 and pGAD-C3. To generate the C-terminal fragments of hVps22p either bp 244-777 or 349-777 were amplified by PCR with an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and SalI site after the stop codon. These fragments were subcloned into pGBDU-C3 and pGAD-C3. hVPS36 was amplified from IMAGE clone 4814999 and subcloned into pGBDU-C3 and pGAD-C3 as described for hVPS25. As with hVPS22, the IMAGE clone sequence of hVPS36 and our sequence were identical but differed this time in 2 bases from the published sequence of hVPS36 (33Kamura T. Burian D. Khalili H.

These changes alter one amino acid: our sequence has Ser at 223, and the published sequence has Arg. Upon aligning our sequence with Vps36p sequences from several organisms, we found that Ser was conserved at this position in both the mouse and fruit fly protein sequences. We therefore decided not to mutate this residue in our sequence. To generate the N-terminal fragment of hVps36p for two-hybrid analysis, bp 1-375 of hVPS36 were amplified by PCR with an EcoRI site before the start codon and a stop codon engineered after base pair 375 followed by a SalI site. These restriction sites were used to subclone the fragment into plasmids pGBDU-C3 and pGAD-C3. To generate the C-terminal fragments of hVps36p, bp 376-1161 or 694-1161 were amplified by PCR with an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and a SalI site after the stop codon. These fragments were subcloned into pGBDU-C3 and pGAD-C3. hVPS20 was amplified from IMAGE clone 3604039 and subcloned into pGBDU-C3 and pGAD-C3 as described for hVPS25. Yeast two-hybrid plasmids containing yeast VPS25, VPS22, VPS36, and VPS20 have been described previously (16Bowers K. Lottridge J. Helliwell S.B. Goldthwaite L.M. Luzio J.P. Stevens T.H. Traffic. 2004; 5: 194-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For protein purification, full-length hVPS25 was subcloned into pMW172-GST such that the C terminus of hVPS25 was in-frame with a thrombin-cleavable GST tag. A fragment corresponding to residues 232-end of hVPS36 (the CB fragment), and a second fragment corresponding to residues 82-end (the C1 fragment) of hVps22p, each preceded by a ribosome-binding site were sequentially subcloned into pMW172-hVPS25-GST. hVps22p had an N-terminal His6 tag. This construct allowed co-expression of the three ESCRTII subunits from one plasmid under the control of a single T7 promoter. The dsRed-VPS4B E235Q construct was a kind gift from Prof. Wes Sundquist (Salt Lake City, UT) (37von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M. Chung H.Y. Morita E. Wang H.E. Davis T. He G.P.

To generate antibodies against hVps25p, a GST-hVps25p fusion protein was purified from bacteria as previously described (16Bowers K. Lottridge J. Helliwell S.B. Goldthwaite L.M. Luzio J.P. Stevens T.H. Traffic. 2004; 5: 194-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and used to immunize rabbits (Harlan Sera-Lab Ltd). Anti-hVps25p antibodies were affinity-purified using purified His6-hVps25p covalently bound to a CNBr-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and the method described in Mullock et al.

Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast were grown and transformed using standard genetic techniques and grown in rich medium (YEPD: 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 2% glucose (48Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY2000Google Scholar)) or synthetic dextrose minimal medium with appropriate amino acid supplements (SD: 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2% glucose (48Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY2000Google Scholar)). Amino acid drop-out mixes were from Formedium Ltd. The yeast strains and two-hybrid plasmids have been described previously (41James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strain pJ69-4α was transformed with GAL4-DNA binding domain plasmids (pGBDU) and plated onto SD without uracil. Yeast strain pJ69-4a was transformed with GAL4-DNA activation domain plasmids (pGAD) and plated onto SD without leucine. The α and a strains were mated on YEPD for 8 h at 30°C, and then diploids were selected on SD without uracil and leucine. After replating onto SD without uracil and leucine, diploids were replica-plated onto SD without adenine. Interaction of the binding- and activation-domain fusion proteins was scored by growth of the yeast on SD without adenine over 8 days. Protein Purification—pMW172 with hVPS25-GST, hVPS36 (CB), and His6-hVPS22 (C1) was used to transform BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli (Novagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.8 was reached, induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown overnight at 22 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl with protease inhibitors and DNase, and lysed using a cell disruptor. Proteins were purified either on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or Ni-NTA (Qiagen) columns. Columns were washed extensively and eluted with 20 mm glutathione or 300 mm imidazole, respectively. siRNA Knockdowns—The siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. The TSG101, Alix, and AMSH siRNA duplexes were as described (42McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbe S. J.

The hVps25p and UBPY depletions were performed using Dharmacon SMARTpools consisting of four oligonucleotides each. The target sequences of hVPS25 were CAGAACAACTCCGTCTTTA, GCACAAGGCCGAGATCATC, GGGAAACTCATCTATCAGT, and GTCGATCCAGATTGTATTA, and the target sequences of UBPY were GAAGATCAATGACCAGTTT, TGAAATACGTGACTGTTTA, GGACAGGACAGTATAGATA, and AAATAAAGCTCAACGAGAA. The oligonucleotides all had 3′-UU overhangs and were synthesized using Dharmacon Option A4. siRNA oligonucleotides against hVPS22 and hVPS36 were Dharmacon SMARTpools with 3′-UU overhangs. 4 × 105HeLa cells were seeded into 6-cm dishes and transfected the following day with siRNA oligonucleotides using the procedure described in Motley et al.

https://openalex.org/W2081905674,"The molecular mechanisms that enable yeast cells to detect and transmit cold signals and their physiological significance in the adaptive response to low temperatures are unknown. Here, we have demonstrated that the MAPK Hog1p is specifically activated in response to cold. Phosphorylation of Hog1p was dependent on Pbs2p, the MAPK kinase (MAPKK) of the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, and Ssk1p, the response regulator of the two-component system Sln1p-Ypd1p. However, Sho1p was not required. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Hog1p was stimulated at 30 °C in cells exposed to the membrane rigidifier agent dimethyl sulfoxide. Moreover, Hog1p activation occurred specifically through the Sln1 branch. This suggests that Sln1p monitors changes in membrane fluidity caused by cold. Quite remarkably, activation of Hog1p at low temperatures affected the transcriptional response to cold shock. Indeed, the absence of Hog1p impaired the cold-instigated expression of genes for trehalose- and glycerol-synthesizing enzymes and small chaperones. Moreover, a downward transfer to 12 or 4 °C stimulated the overproduction of glycerol in a Hog1p-dependent manner. However, hog1Δ mutant cells showed no growth defects at 12 °C as compared with the wild type. On the contrary, deletion of HOG1 or GPD1 decreased tolerance to freezing of wild-type cells preincubated at a low temperature, whereas no differences could be detected in cells shifted directly from 30 to –20 °C. Thus, exposure to low temperatures triggered a Hog1p-dependent accumulation of glycerol, which is essential for freeze protection.

Thus, exposure to low temperatures triggered a Hog1p-dependent accumulation of glycerol, which is essential for freeze protection. Variations in the surrounding temperature are probably the most common stress for all living organisms. In particular, a downshift in temperature leads to a reduction in membrane fluidity, impaired protein biosynthesis, and stabilization of secondary structures of DNA and RNA (1Thieringer H.A. Jones P.G. Inouye M. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Consequently, the adaptive response to cold shock in most organisms, studied so far, includes a change in the lipid composition of membranes and the remodeling of the transcriptional and translational machinery. These changes are mainly triggered by a drastic variation in the gene expression program, which leads to both survival and adaptation to low temperatures. Unlike other stress conditions, the biochemical mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells sense changes and respond to a downshift in temperature are poorly understood. Using the cyanobacteria Synechocystis as an experimental model, Murata and Los (2Murata N. Los D.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) suggested that a phase transition of the plasma membrane upon cold shock would trigger a conformational change of a putative cold sensor, this being the primary event in the transduction of the temperature signal. According to this hypothesis, a membrane-bound histidine kinase, Hik33, has been identified as a cold sensor in this organism, which is able to detect changes in the physical state of the membrane and regulate the expression of most cold-induced genes (3Suzuki I. Los D.A. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Murata N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 4Suzuki I. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Kanehisa M. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Other putative cold sensors, such as DesK in Bacillus subtilis (5Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L.E. Erazo A.C. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels in the mammalian nervous system (6McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), have also been characterized as integral membrane proteins. Recently, Hik33 has been shown to regulate the expression in Synechocystis of osmostress-inducible genes (7Mikami K. Kanesaki Y. Suzuki I. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), suggesting that both osmotic and cold stress could be perceived in this organism by common mechanisms and sensing elements. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an increase in environmental osmolarity is perceived by one of two osmosensors, Sln1p, the only known yeast histidine kinase sensor, and Sho1p, a transmembrane protein (reviewed in Refs. 8de Nadal E. Alepuz P.M. Posas F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 10Westfall P.J. Ballon D.R. Thorner J. Science. 2004; 306: 1511-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recently, a third osmosensor, Msb2p, displaying a redundant function with Sho1p, has also been characterized (11O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4739-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sln1p, together with Ypd1p and Ssk1p, forms a so-called two-component system (12Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 19: 242-245Crossref Scopus (942) Google Scholar), a typical signal transduction system found in other fungi, plants, and bacteria (13Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once the osmosensors are activated, they transmit the osmostress signal through different elements. This signal is integrated at the level of the MAPKK 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; HOG, high osmolarity glycerol; YNB, yeast nitrogen base; YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidin 2-phenyldiol. Pbs2p. Then, Pbs2p phosphorylates the Hog1p MAPK, which gives the name to the osmoregulatory MAPK cascade, the HOG pathway. Although the HOG pathway has classically been considered as specific to osmotic stress, recent studies have revealed new functions for this MAPK route. Evidence suggests that the HOG pathway is essential for regulating adaptation to citric acid stress in yeast (14Lawrence C.L. Botting C.H. Antrobus R. Coote P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 3307-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Heat stress also activates the HOG pathway, through the membrane-bound osmosensor Sho1p (15Winkler A. Arkind C. Mattison C.P. Burkholder A. Knoche K. Ota I. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). HOG basal activity is also involved in methylglyoxal resistance (16Aguilera J. Rodríguez-Vargas S. Prieto J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), distribution of proteins within the Golgi (17Reynolds T.B. Hopkins D.B. Lyons M.R. Graham T.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and cell wall maintenance (18García-Rodríguez L.J. Duran A. Roncero C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2428-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Additional functions to that of osmostress signaling have been identified for HOG homologous pathways in other species. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the Wak1p/Win1p-Wis1p-Sty1p SAPK pathway drives the transcriptional response to different stimuli, such as osmostress, heat shock, oxidative, and UV injury integrating the response to multiple stresses into a common cascade (for a review, see Ref. 19Gacto M. Soto T. Vicente-Soler J. Villa T.G. Cansado J. Int. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The central element of this cascade is the Sty1p MAPK (20Millar J.B. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), the functional homologue to mammalian p54 JNK and p38, two of the three mammalian stress-activated MAPKs, SAPKs (8de Nadal E. Alepuz P.M. Posas F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and yeast Hog1p. Recently, Sty1p has been reported to be phosphorylated in response to cold shock, leading to the activation of cold-induced genes (21Soto T. Beltran F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5056-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, a downshift in temperature triggers the activation of p54 JNK (22Ohsaka Y. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Ishizaki K. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2002; 12: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of these responses in cold adaptation and the mechanisms that trigger activation upon cold shock of osmoregulatory MAPK pathways remain unclear. Our objective in this study was to characterize the molecular mechanisms mediating cold response in S. cerevisiae. We hypothesized that the HOG MAPK pathway plays an important role in the phenotypic adaptation of yeast cells to this stress. Our results have shown that the HOG pathway mediates in transmitting the cold signal, regulates the expression of a subset of cold-induced genes, and determines viability on freezing. These findings have supported the idea that the HOG pathway plays a more general role in stress response in yeast, thus representing an important advance to our limited knowledge of the strategies and targets involved in cell protection against freeze injury.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and pGP22, a derivative of vector pRS413, which contains the PTP2-coding sequence under the control of the pGAL1 (H. Saito). Yeast cells were transformed according to Ito et al. (27Ito H. Jukuda K. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected by auxotrophic complementation in YNB plates. E. coli was transformed by electroporation following the manufacturer’s instructions (Eppendorf). RNA Purification and Northern Blot Analysis—Cells from 30-ml culture samples were harvested by centrifugation (5,500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 0.5 ml of LETS buffer (200 mm LiCl, 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.4% SDS), and transferred to a screw-cap Eppendorf tube containing 0.5 ml of phenol and 0.5 ml of glass beads (acid-washed, 0.4-mm diameter). The suspension was mixed vigorously twice, for 45 s each time, in a Mini Bead-Beater homogenizer (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK), and total RNA was purified as described previously (25Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Purified RNA was diluted in 30–50 μl of sterile diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Equal amounts of RNA (30 μg) were separated in 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing formaldehyde (2.5% v/v), transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. PCR-amplified DNA fragments containing sequences of TPS1 (–2 to +1,492), NSR1 (–48 to +536), OLE1 (+111 to +1,121), HSP12 (+1 to +329), GLO1 (+5 to +975), TIP1 (–139 to +1,507), GRE1 (+1 to +506), GPD1 (+23 to +848), and ACT1 (+10 to +1083) were used to probe mRNA levels. DNA sequences were obtained from the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) data base. Probes were radiolabeled with the random primer Ready-to-Go kit (Amersham Biosciences, Chalfont-St Giles, England) and[α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were exposed to a high resolution BAS-MP 2040S imaging plate (Fuji, Kyoto, Japan) for 24–48 h and scanned in a phosphorimaging device (Fuji, FLA-3000). Spot intensities were quantified with the Image Gauge software version 3.12 (Fuji). Values of spot intensity were corrected according to the ACT1 mRNA level and represented as the relative mRNA level. The highest relative mRNA for each gene and sample analyzed was set at 100. Preparation of Yeast Extracts and Western Blot—To prepare whole-cell extracts for Hog1p detection, cells were harvested by filtration, transferred to a tube containing 300 μl of SDS loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol), and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. Ten μl of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Filters were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20). Dual phosphorylated Hog1p was detected by an antibody specific to phosphorylated p38 MAPK (catalog number 9215, Cell signaling, Beverly, MA). A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to the carboxyl terminus (221–435) of S. cerevisiae Hog1p was used as a loading control (catalog number sc-9079, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The antisera were applied at 1:1000 (phosphorylated Hog1p) and 1:6000 (total Hog1p) dilutions according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Blots were developed using the ECL Western blotting detection kit from Amersham Biosciences. Films were scanned in an HP Scanjet 5370c (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) and quantified with the Image Gauge software version 3.12 (Fuji). Intensity values of phospho-Hog1p were corrected according to the total Hog1p level. The highest relative value for each protein and sample analyzed was set at 100. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were cultured as described, and DAPI (2.5 μg/ml final concentration) was added to the culture 1 h before microscopy. One-ml samples were taken at different times before and after Me2SO addition. Samples were spun for 10 s, the supernatant was decanted, and the cells were resuspended in the residual liquid. Aliquots of 4 μl were directly observed in a microscope Leica DM IRB, employing filters for GFP and DAPI fluorescence. False positives were detected by comparison with DAPI pictures, which revealed the position of the nuclei. At least 100 cells were visualized each time. Glycerol Assay—To determine intracellular glycerol content under cold stress conditions, YPD-grown cells (A600 = 1.0) were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 12 or 4 °C precooled YPD culture medium, and incubated at the indicated temperature. At different times, cells (10 units of A600) were collected by filtration and quickly transferred to a cold tube containing 1 ml of distilled water. Then, the yeast suspension was boiled for 10 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged at 15,300 × g for 10 min (4 °C). Finally, the supernatant was collected and used for further analysis. Glycerol was determined colorimetrically with a commercial kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The values obtained are expressed as μg of glycerol per mg of yeast cells, dry weight. To do this, we used a cell mass value of 0.3 mg of cell dry weight/ml/unit of A600 (28Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Viability Experiments—Cell cultures were grown in YPD liquid medium at 30 °C (A600 = 0.4–0.6), and samples were transferred directly to –20 °C or preincubated at 12 or 4 °C for 6 or 48 h, respectively, prior the shift to –20 °C. At different times, samples were thawed at 30 °C for 30 min and diluted, and cells were plated onto solid YPD. After 2 days, colonies were counted, and the percentage of viable cells was measured. A Downshift in Temperature Triggers the Phosphorylation of Hog1p via the Sln1 Branch of the HOG Pathway—We examined the effect of a temperature downshift on the phosphorylation state of Hog1p in cells of the parental strain BY4741. Fig. 1 shows the results of a Western blot analysis of protein extracts analyzed with anti-phospho p38 antibody, which recognizes the dual-phosphorylated form (Thr-174, Tyr-176) of Hog1p, and polyclonal anti-Hog1p as a loading control. Hog1p was clearly activated in response to a thermal transfer from 30 to 12 °C. The kinetics of Hog1p phosphorylation was similar to that previously reported for yeast cells subjected to mild osmotic stress (29van Wuytswinkel O. Reiser V. Siderius M. Kelders M.C. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mager W.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation level reached a maximum within 5–10 min of exposure to low temperature and decreased markedly after 30 min. Similar results were found when cells were transferred to 15 or 10 °C (data not shown). We further investigated whether the cold-instigated phosphorylation of Hog1p was dependent on upstream components of the HOG pathway. The mechanisms and elements implied in the Hog1p MAPK activation by osmostress have been widely characterized (8de Nadal E. Alepuz P.M. Posas F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 10Westfall P.J. Ballon D.R. Thorner J. Science. 2004; 306: 1511-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Hog1p is directly dependent on Pbs2p MAPKK, which is, in turn, activated by any of the two feeding signals derived from Sho1p or the Sln1p-Ypd1p two-component system. As can be seen in Fig. 1, phosphorylation of Hog1p at 12 °C was completely absent in a pbs2Δ mutant. Then, we analyzed the signal transfer from the two putative osmosensing receptors, Sho1p and Sln1p. Disruption of SLN1 histidine kinase is lethal (12Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 19: 242-245Crossref Scopus (942) Google Scholar), and therefore, we visualized the phosphorylation of Hog1p in mutants of the SSK1 response regulator. As shown in Fig. 1, deletion of SHO1 had no major effects on the phospho-Hog1p accumulation after a temperature downshift. By contrast, deletion of SSK1 eliminated the cold-instigated phosphorylation of the MAPK. Therefore, a downward shift to low temperatures drove the phosphorylation of the osmosensitive HOG MAPK pathway. However, only the Sln1 branch appeared to be absolutely essential for this response. Exposure of Yeast Cells to Me2SO Leads to the Phosphorylation and Nuclear Import of the MAPK Hog1p—The absence of cold-instigated phosphorylation of Hog1p in the sho1Δ mutant suggested that osmotic imbalance and cold stress are recognized differently by yeast cells. We tried to find further support for this idea by analyzing what effects a change in the physical state of the yeast membrane had on the phosphorylation state of Hog1p. Cold stress is assumed to cause rapid but reversible rigidification of the plasma membrane, which can be mimicked by treating the membrane with the rigidifier Me2SO. This hypothesis has been validated by different studies on plant cells (30Örvar B.L. Sangwan V. Omann F. Dhindsa R.S. Plant J. 2000; 23: 785-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sangwan V. Örvar B.L. Beyerly J. Hirt H. Dhindsa R.S. Plant J. 2002; 31: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Like exposure to low temperature, treatment with Me2SO induces rigidification of the plant cell membrane, leading to activation of several cold-induced MAPKs (31Sangwan V. Örvar B.L. Beyerly J. Hirt H. Dhindsa R.S. Plant J. 2002; 31: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, there are reports of a connection between membrane physical state and heat shock gene transcription (32Carratu L. Franceschelli S. Pardini C.L. Kobayashi G.S. Horvath I. Vigh L. Maresca B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3870-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Consequently, we tested whether the HOG pathway could be activated by chemically modulated changes in membrane fluidity. As shown in Fig. 2A, Western blot revealed that the rapid and transient phosphorylation of Hog1p was activated by adding 250 mm Me2SO to a yeast culture of the BY4741 wild-type strain. Similar results were observed by exposure to sublethal Me2SO concentrations in the range 125–500 mm (data not shown). Quite remarkably, Me2SO activated Hog1p in sho1Δ mutant cells but not in the ssk1Δ mutant (Fig. 2A). Moreover, phosphorylation of Hog1p was completely dependent on Pbs2p. Thus, our results suggest that Me2SO selectively stimulates the Sln1 branch of the HOG pathway. Hog1 protein is reported to move into the nucleus upon phosphorylation (24Cvrcková F. de Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Therefore, nuclear localization of the MAPK by treating the cells with Me2SO would be further evidence of its activation. To test this, we used a hog1Δ mutant strain (W303-1A background) transformed with plasmid pVR65, carrying a HOG1-GFP fusion (26Reiser V. Ruis H. Ammerer G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and Me2SO-exposed cells were visualized by fluorescent microscopy. As shown, the rigidifying agent induced the nuclear accumulation of Hog1p-GFP just 10 min after the treatment (Fig. 2B). We also observed that nuclear localization of Hog1p did not decrease at all in 30 min. This fact was in consonance with the phosphorylation kinetics displayed in this strain. Indeed, Hog1p phosphorylation by Me2SO in cells of the S. cerevisiae W303-1A strain lasted longer (Fig. 2B) as compared with that seen in the BY4741 strain (Fig. 2A). Thus, if yeast cells are exposed to Me2SO at 30 °C, the cold-induced phosphorylation of Hog1p is mimicked, and the nuclear localization of the MAPK is determined. A Functional HOG Pathway Is Dispensable for Growth at Low Temperature—S. pombe responds to cold by inducing the SAPK pathway. However, such activation is not necessary for growth at low temperatures (21Soto T. Beltran F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5056-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in testing the effects of HOG pathway activation in the cold response of S. cerevisiae. Exponentially growing cells of the parental BY4741 and HOG pathway mutant strains were plated on YPD medium and cultivated at 30 or 12 °C (Fig. 3). As can be seen, deletion of HOG1, PBS2, SHO1, or SSK1 had no effects on the growth of the parental strain at 12 °C. Similar results were observed at 15 or 10 °C or when growth at a low temperature was tested in either YPD or YNB liquid medium (data not shown). The HOG Pathway Is Involved in the Genetic Response to Cold Stress—Under osmotic stress, activation of Hog1p alters the expression of hundred of genes (33Rep M. Krantz M. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8290-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Therefore, we looked into how the HOG pathway is involved in the transcriptional response of S. cerevisiae to cold shock. Three genes, OLE1, TIP1, and NSR1, previously reported as cold-induced and traditionally used as cold shock response markers (34Kondo K. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17537-17544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kondo K. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16252-16258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kowalski L.R. Kondo K. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were probed by Northern blot of mRNA samples from wild-type and hog1Δ mutant cells. OLE1 encodes the stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase (37Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TIP1 encodes a mannoprotein of the cell wall (36Kowalski L.R. Kondo K. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and NSR1 is a nucleolar protein involved in pre-rRNA processing (35Kondo K. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16252-16258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, transcription of OLE1, TIP1, and NSR1 was fully induced in wild-type cells within 2–4 h after a shift from 30 to 12 °C (Fig. 4A). However, no effects were found on deleting HOG1. Indeed, all three marker genes displayed similar kinetics of mRNA variation when samples from wild-type and hog1Δ strains were compared (Fig. 4A). Next we examined the cold-inducible expression of a different set of genes. In particular, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of GLO1, GPD1, TPS1, HSP12, and GRE1. GLO1 encodes glyoxalase I (38Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The product of GPD1 catalyzes the first step in the glycerol pathway (39Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). TPS1 encodes the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (40Bell W. Klaassen P. Ohnacker M. Boller T. Herweijer M. Schoppink P. Van der Zee P. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). HSP12 encodes a small heat shock protein (41Praekelt U.M. Meacock P.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 223: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and GRE1 encodes for a protein of unknown function. It has recently been reported that all of them are induced by 6–8 h of incubation at 10 °C (42Sahara T. Goda T. Ohgiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50015-50021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a regulation pattern that was missed in earlier studies of the cold shock response (35Kondo K. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16252-16258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kowalski L.R. Kondo K. Inouye M. Mol.

Commun. 2001; 283: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Findings also show that TPS1 expression is activated below 10 °C and even at 0 °C (45Vigh L. Maresca B. Harwood J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig. 4B, the expression level of all the marker genes tested increased markedly in cold-shocked cells of the wild-type strain. Nevertheless, they showed different kinetics of mRNA variation. The transcript accumulation of GLO1"

https://openalex.org/W2032429373,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by infection of a previously undescribed coronavirus (CoV). L-SIGN, encoded by CLEC4M (also known as CD209L), is a SARS-CoV binding receptor that has polymorphism in its extracellular neck region encoded by the tandem repeat domain in exon 4. Our genetic risk association study shows that individuals homozygous for CLEC4M tandem repeats are less susceptible to SARS infection. L-SIGN is expressed in both non-SARS and SARS-CoV-infected lung. Compared with cells heterozygous for L-SIGN, cells homozygous for L-SIGN show higher binding capacity for SARS-CoV, higher proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a lower capacity for trans infection. Thus, homozygosity for L-SIGN plays a protective role during SARS infection."

However, molecular events regarding epigenetic reprogramming of the somatic chromatin are poorly understood.

A low level of acetylated histone H4-lysine 5 (AcH4K5) of the somatic chromatin was sustained at the pronuclear stage. Unlike in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos, the AcH4K5 level remarkably reduced at the 8-cell stage in cloned bovine embryos.

Differences of AcH4K5 signal intensity were more distinguishable in the metaphase chromosomes between IVF and cloned embryos. Two imprinted genes, Ndn and Xist, were aberrantly expressed in cloned embryos as compared with IVF embryos, which is partly associated with the AcH4K5 signal intensity.

To obtain developmental competence of cloned embryos to term, the differentiated cell nucleus should be subject to epigenetic reprogramming processes including chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation during preimplantation development. In the somatic cell nuclear transfer, many clinical anomalies such as high abortion rates, increased body weight, and early death after birth have been reported (1Wilmut I. Schnieke A.E. McWhir J.

Especially, abnormal epigenetic reprogramming may lead to faulty or differential gene expression, thereby resulting in developmental defects of cloned embryos. An intrinsic difference in the early embryonic development between fertilization and somatic cell cloning may arise from distinct chromatin architectures between spermatozoa and somatic cells. In fact, activation and remodeling in a reconstructed oocyte with a somatic cell nucleus might obviously differ from the processes of normal fertilization. In mammals, maternal and paternal genomes should reprogram to reach a totipotent state for normal development. During fertilization, the sperm genome remodels in the oocyte cytoplasm after replacement of its protamines with oocyte histones. In the somatic cell nuclear transfer, however, remodeling of somatic chromatins may be entirely discriminated because of a paucity of sperm factors and incomplete microenvironment within the enucleated oocyte cytoplasm. Differences of chromatin remodeling can be also because of diverse histone variants between germ and somatic cells (17Sarma K. Reinberg D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 18Kimmins S. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 2005; 434: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). For instance, a variant subtype of histone linker H1, H1foo, is relatively enriched in the chromatin of mouse oocytes (19Clarke H.J. Bustin M. Oblin C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 477-487PubMed Google Scholar) and rapidly replaced with somatic H1 linker histone after fertilization or somatic cell nuclear transfer (20Teranishi T. Tanaka M. Kimoto S. Ono Y.

Biol. 2004; 266: 62-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, how the maternal and paternal genomes reprogram to set chromatin structure is still poorly understood. The histones play essential roles in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation through modifications of the histone amino termini, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitinylation (22Turner B.M.

Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). Hyperacetylation of histones could facilitate the access of some transcription factors to nucleosomes (24Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J.

In the interphase, the histone acetylation is involved in gene expression (26Agalioti T. Chen G. Thanos D.

During mitosis, histone acetylation may function as an epigenetic mark, a histone code, by which information about genomic function is transmitted from one generation of cells to the next (30Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The histone H4 is acetylated in order at lysine 16, lysine 8 or 12, and lysine 5 (31O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3946-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), implying that acetylation at lysine 5 corresponds to the hyperacetylation state (25Turner B.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In early embryonic development, activation of the embryonic genome is a critical event for onset of transcription. It has been known that activation of the embryonic genome occurs during the 2-cell stage in the mouse (33Latham K.E. Garrels J.I. Chang C. Solter D. Development. 1991; 112: 921-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but transcription actually initiates at mid to late S phase of the 1-cell embryo (34Bouniol C. Nguyen E. Debey P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 35Aoki F. Worrad D.M. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 296-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In the bovine, initial genomic activation occurs from 8- to 16-cell embryos (36Kopecny V. Flechon J.E. Camous S. Fulka Jr., J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1989; 1: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 37Bordignon V. Clarke H.J. Smith L.C. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transcriptional and translational activities of some genes are observed as early as the 2-cell stage in the bovine (38Hyttel P. Viuff D. Avery B. Laurincik J. Greve T. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1996; 108: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Viuff D. Avery B. Greve T. King W.A. Hyttel P. Mol. Reprod.

Histone hyperacetylation results in increased expression of transgenes in early stages of mouse embryos (41Thompson E.M. Legouy E. Christians E. Renard J.P. Development. 1995; 121: 3425-3437PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that histone acetylation may be involved in embryonic gene expression. Several genes that are required for development are abnormally expressed in cloned bovine embryos (42Pfister-Genskow M. Myers C. Childs L.A. Lacson J.C. Patterson T. Betthauser J.M. Goueleke P.J. Koppang R.W. Lange G. Fisher P. Watt S.R. Forsberg E.J. Zheng Y. Leno G.H. Schultz R.M. Liu B. Chetia C. Yang X. Hoeschele I. Eilertsen K.J. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although it is unclear whether abnormal gene expression is directly correlated to the epigenetic reprogramming in cloned embryos. In this study, the acetylation status of histone H4 at lysine 5 (AcH4K5) was examined to monitor epigenetic reprogramming of somatic chromatins in cloned embryos. As results, we found the anomaly of cloned embryos in the dynamic modulation of histone H4 acetylation. Histone acetylation status of somatic cell chromatins that were seldom reprogrammed in the enucleated oocyte cytoplast and its levels were arbitrarily fluctuated in early cloned embryos. Along with histone acetylation, two imprinted genes were aberrantly expressed in cloned bovine embryos as compared with normal embryos. Here we suggest that epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation abnormally reprogram in cloned embryos throughout early development, thereby resulting in dysregulation of gene expression. These observations may hint at the reasons of the developmental defects that are familiar with cloned animals in the somatic cell nuclear transfer. In Vitro Maturation and in Vitro Fertilization (IVF)—Bovine ovaries were collected from a local slaughterhouse and transported to the laboratory in 0.9% saline at 25-30 °C. Cumulus-oocytes complexes were obtained through a disposable 10-ml syringe with 18-gauge needle from follicles of 2-6 mm in diameter. Approximately 50 oocytes were incubated in 500 μl of the in vitro maturation medium in a 4-well multidish (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) under paraffin oil for 20 h at 38.5 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium used for oocyte maturation was TCM-199 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml FSH-P (Folltropin-V, Vetrepharm, London, UK), 0.6 mm cysteine, 0.2 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1 μg/ml estradiol-17β. After in vitro maturation, 10 oocytes were fertilized with frozen-thawed sperm at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in 50 μl of fertilization medium (43Bavister B.D. Yanagimachi R. Biol. Reprod. 1977; 16: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). When sperm was added to the fertilization drops, 2 μg/ml heparin, 20 μm penicillamine, 10 μm hypotaurine, and 1 μm epinephrine (PHE) were also added. Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer and in Vitro Culture—Bovine ear skin fibroblasts were used as donor cells for nuclear transfer. Donor cells were plated into a six-well plate and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% FBS until confluent. Donor cells were washed with PBS and digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 5 min, then the cells were blocked with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were spun down at a low speed (150 × g) for 2 min and resuspended with PBS. Oocytes that matured in vitro were enucleated with a glass pipette by aspirating the first polar body and MII plate of the partial cytoplasm in TL-Hepes containing 7.5 μg/ml cytochalasin B. Enucleation was confirmed by Hoechst 33342 staining and visualizing the aspirated portion of the cytoplasm under ultraviolet light. A single cell was transferred into the perivitelline space of the enucleated oocyte cytoplast. Oocytes-cell couplets were fused using fusion chamber with two stainless steel electrodes (1 mm apart) in fusion medium consisting of 0.3 m mannitol, 0.5 mm Hepes, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm MgCl2. A single direct pulse (1.6 kV/cm, 20 μs) was performed on an Electro Cell Manipulator 2001 (BTX, San Diego, CA). Activation of fused embryos was performed as a previously described modified method (2Cibelli J.B. Stice S.L. Golueke P.J. Kane J.J. Jerry J. Blackwell C. Ponce de Leon F.A. Robl J.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1256-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). At 2 h after electrofusion, fused embryos were activated with 5 μm ionomycin for 5 min, followed by treatment with 2.5 mm 6-dimethylaminopurine in CR1aa containing 10% FBS at 38.5 °C, 5% CO2 in air for 4 h. Fertilized and reconstructed embryos were cultured in CR1aa supplemented with 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free). After culture for 3 days, cleaved embryos were further cultured in each drop of 50 μl of CR1aa with 10% FBS for 4 days. After 7 days of culture, blastocyst formation was observed. Cell Culture and TSA Treatment—Bovine ear skin fibroblasts (bESF) of passages 4-6 were used in this study and cultured in growth media containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μm non-essential amino acid (Invitrogen), and 500 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. bESF cells were seeded 7 × 104 cells per well on a 24-well culture plate or 1 × 106 cells on a 10-cm culture dish, and treated with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for 60 h at a final concentration of 1 μm. To obtain much more metaphase chromosomes, the cells were cultured in growth medium containing nocodazole (40 ng/ml) for 60 h. Immunostaining and Quantification of Fluorescence Intensity—bESF cells and embryos were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells and embryos were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TPBS) for 1 h and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h at 4°C. Then, the samples were treated with 1% bovine serum albumin in TPBS at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibody was diluted 50 times with PBS and co-incubated with samples for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing for 3 h, samples were incubated for 30 min in the presence of Cy3 anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and then washed for 1 h. Samples were mounted on slides with 90% glycerol-PBS containing 1 fg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular Probes). The antibodies specific for histone H4-acetylated lysine 5 (anti-AcH4K5; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake placid, NY) and histone deacetylase 2 (anti-HDAC2, Santa Cruz Biologicals, Santa Cruz, CA) were used in this experiment. The samples were observed on an Olympus epifluorescence light microscope. Exposure times from fluorescent light were kept constant for the respective channel (Cy3 or DAPI). Quantity of images was determined using an image analyzer system, SigmaScan-pro V5.01 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), by the ratios of AcH4K5 or HDAC2 to DAPI DNA signals. The images were merged using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. mRNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis—Five embryos of the respective developmental stage were pooled in 1 μl of PVA-PBS and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen until RNA isolation. Poly(A) mRNAs were extracted following the manufacturer’s instructions using the Dynabeads mRNA Direct Kit (Dynal). After thawing, the samples were lysed in 50 μl of lysis/binding buffer (Dynal) at room temperature for 10 min. Then, 10 μl of Dynabeads oligo(dT)25 were added to each sample. The beads were hybridized for 5 min and separated from the binding buffer using the Dynal magnetic separator. Poly(A) mRNAs and beads were washed in buffers A and B (DYNAL), and were separated by adding 11 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Poly(A) mRNAs were reverse transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl containing using 2.5 μm random hexamer primer, 1× reverse transcription buffer, 20 IU of RNase inhibitor, 50 IU Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase enzyme (Promega, Madrid, Spain), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm of each dNTP. After denaturation of the secondary RNA structure at 70 °C for 5 min, the cDNA was complete by the following conditions at room temperature for 10 min, at 42 °C for 60 min to allow the reverse transcription of RNA, and at 93 °C for 1 min to denature the enzyme. Real-time PCR—The quantification of all gene transcripts was carried out in three replicate by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR on the MJ Opticon® 2 system (MJ Research Inc., Reno, NV) using SYBR Green, a double-stranded DNA-specific fluorescent dye. The primer sequences for each gene are as follows: β-actin (GeneBank™ accession number AY141970), 5′-GGTGATCGCTTTTGTGTAATTATGT-3′ (sense), 5′-GCTGTCCATTCAAAATAAAACAAACA-3′ (antisense); Ndn (GeneBank™ accession number AY360449), 5′-AACGTGCTGCGCATCTTG-3′ (sense), 5′-TCAGGTAGTTCTGCTGGACGAA-3′ (antisense); and Xist (GeneBank™ accession number AF104906), 5′-AATAATGCGACAGGCAAAGG-3′ (sense), 5-TCCCGCTCATTTTCCATTAG-3′ (antisense). The reaction mixture of the total 20-μl volume consisted of 10 μl of 2 × buffer (containing modified DyNAmo hot start DNA polymerase, SYBR Green I, optimerase PCR buffer, 5 mm MgCl2 and dNTP mixture including dUTP; Molecular Probes), 2 μl of each primer (0.2 μm), 4 μl of double distilled water, and 2 μl of cDNA template. The PCR was conducted in an initial step of 94 °C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The fluorescence values were determined after each elongation step. The dissociation curve was analyzed following the final cycle to determine the specificity of amplification. The melting protocol consisted of holding at 40 °C for 60 s and then heating from 65 to 95 °C, holding at each temperature for 0.1 s while monitoring fluorescence. Fluorescent data were determined at 85 °C for β-actin, 82°C for Ndn, and 78 °C for Xist, respectively. To identify specific amplification of a single PCR product, the product was confirmed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The comparative CT method was used for quantification of expression levels. Fluorescence was acquired in each cycle to determine the threshold cycle, the cycle during the log linear phase of the reaction at which fluorescence was increased above background for each sample. Within this region of the amplification curve, each difference of one cycle is equivalent to a doubling of the amplified product of the PCR. The sample ΔCT (SΔCT) value was calculated by the difference between the β-actin CT value and the sample CT value. To evaluate expression levels of the imprinted genes between each developmental stage in IVF, NT, and TSA-nuclear transfer (NT) embryos, the ΔCT value of IVF morula was used as the control ΔCT (CΔCT) value. For comparison of gene expression levels on each developmental stage among IVF, NT, and TSA-NT embryos, the ΔCT value of the IVF embryo was employed as the control ΔCT (CΔCT) value.-Fold differences of the gene expression were determined by using the formula, 2-(SΔCT-CΔCT). Western Blotting—Cells (∼1 × 107 cells) were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 10 volumes of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) on ice for 5 min. The nuclear pellet was washed with 10 volumes of lysis buffer to remove cytoplasmic contaminants, resuspended in 10 volumes of nuclear extract buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to Western blot. The samples were boiled for 5 min, loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, resolved by electrophoresis, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with PBS containing 5% nonfat milk powder at room temperature for 1 h and washed 5 times with TPBS (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C for 30 min. The samples were incubated in PBS containing 5% nonfat milk powder, with the antibodies for HAT1, Tip60, and HDAC2 at 4 °C for 2 h, respectively. After washing with TPBS, the sample was exposed to the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated-antibody) diluted at 1:5,000 in PBS containing 5% nonfat milk powder. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the membrane was washed with TPBS and then developed using the ECL system (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. Statistical Analysis—All data were analyzed by analysis of variance using the SAS package. Quantification of images was determined using an image analyzer system by the ratios of AcH4K5 or HDAC2 to DAPI DNA signals. Individual signal intensity was pooled for each group and analyzed by t test of the multiway analysis of variance. In IVF, NT, and TSA-NT embryos, the level of histone H4 acetylation was expressed as the mean value of total signal intensities pooled from single blastomeres and then a difference was tested by Duncan analysis of multiway analysis of variance. Significant differences of relative expression for Ndn and Xist genes were evaluated by using the Duncan test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Profiles of Histone H4 Acetylation in Somatic Cells—Although aberrant reprogramming of DNA methylation is responsible for low efficiency of animal cloning (6Bourc'his D. Le Bourhis D. Patin D.

Genet. 2001; 28: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), molecular mechanisms involving reset of somatic-type histone modifications during early embryogenesis are still unclear. For this, we first examined the AcH4K5 of donor somatic cells. After treatment with TSA intensity of AcH4K5 signals in bESF was significantly increased (Fig. 1, A and B), which was approximately twice compared with the signals of normal cells (p < 0.05). Western blot analysis represented that the HDAC2 expression level was markedly reduced at 24 h and further decreased at 60 h in TSA-treated cells, whereas histone acetyltransferases, HAT1 and Tip60, were constitutively expressed (Fig. 1C). To chase histone acetylation changes during cell cycle, AcH4K5 signal intensity was measured at each cell cycle stage. In normal cells, intensity of AcH4K5 signals profoundly reduced from the prometaphase to the early telophase and then increased after the late telophase (Fig. 1D). In TSA-treated cells, intensity of AcH4K5 signals gradually increased by the early anaphase, then reduced at the late anaphase and the early telophase, and enhanced at the late telophase (Fig. 1D). Weak Histone H4 Acetylation of NT Embryos at the Pronuclear Stage—Remodeling of parental genomes or somatic cell chromatins can be monitored by investigating changes of epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. In this study, chromatin remodeling occurring during pronuclear formation was compared in terms of histone H4 acetylation between germ cells and somatic cells. Both genomes of sperm and metaphase II-arrested oocytes matured in vitro did not exhibit any signal of AcH4K5 in the bovine (data not shown). Only a few oocytes (3 of 15) showed AcH4K5 signals in the sperm chromatin 7 h after insemination, although the sperm penetration was observed in almost all of the oocytes (14 of 15). The sperm chromatin was initially acetylated in most zygotes (36 of 44) 8 h after insemination, whereas maternal chromatin remained inert on histone H4 acetylation (Fig. 2A). The AcH4K5 signals were detected both in male and female pronuclei 10 h after insemination and thereafter further increased as the zygote developed. Thus, appearance of AcH4K5 is temporally asynchronous between sperm and oocyte genomes. This asynchronous histone H4 acetylation indicates distinct mechanisms in chromatin remodeling between the sperm and oocyte genomes. In the somatic cell NT, AcH4K5 signals were not observed immediately after electrofusion, and then detected in most NT oocytes (6 of 8) 3 h after electrofusion or 1 h after activation (Fig. 2B), whereas most of the TSA-NT (nuclear-transferred with TSA-treated cell) oocytes (9 of 11) displayed AcH4K5 signals even 30 min after electrofusion. During pronuclear development, NT embryos showed a lower AcH4K5 level than IVF and TSA-NT embryos (Fig. 3, A and B, p < 0.05). This difference might be because of a low acetylation state of the donor cell itself because no difference was detected in HDAC2 activity at the pronuclear stage between IVF and NT eggs (supplemental Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 3C, a proportion (20%, 6 of 30) of NT embryos allocated to a presumptive normal range of the AcH4K5/DNA signal ratio (0.65-0.85), which belongs to the mean value of IVF embryos ± 0.1, was lower than those of IVF (73%, 16 of 22) and TSA-NT (51%, 18 of 35) embryos (p < 0.05). Most NT oocytes (73%, 22 of 30) were assigned to a lower AcH4K5/DNA signal ratio (<0.65), whereas approximately half of the TSA-NT oocytes (43%, 15 of 35) were assigned to a higher AcH4K5/DNA signal ratio (>0.85). Thus, NT oocytes were abnormally remodeled in terms of histone acetylation at the pronuclear stage as compared with IVF zygotes. In addition, a difference was detected in the AcH4K5/DNA signal ratio between male and female pronuclei of IVF zygotes (Fig. 3D).

https://openalex.org/W2075981998,"Amplification and overexpression of putative oncogenes confer growth advantages for tumor development. We used a functional genomic approach that integrated simultaneous genomic and transcript microarray, proteomics, and tissue microarray analyses to directly identify putative oncogenes in lung adenocarcinoma. We first identified 183 genes with increases in both genomic copy number and transcript in six lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Next, we used two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify 42 proteins that were overexpressed in the cancer cells relative to normal cells. Comparing the 183 genes with the 42 proteins, we identified four genes – PRDX1, EEF1A2, CALR, and KCIP-1 – in which elevated protein expression correlated with both increased DNA copy number and increased transcript levels (all r>0.84, two-sided P<0.05). These findings were validated by Southern, Northern, and Western blotting. Specific inhibition of EEF1A2 and KCIP-1 expression with siRNA in the four cell lines tested suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis. Parallel fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses of EEF1A2 and KCIP-1 in tissue microarrays from patients with lung adenocarcinoma showed that gene amplification was associated with high protein expression for both genes and that protein overexpression was related to tumor grade, disease stage, Ki-67 expression, and a shorter survival of patients. The amplification of EEF1A2 and KCIP-1 and the presence of overexpressed protein in tumor samples strongly suggest that these genes could be oncogenes and hence potential targets for diagnosis and therapy in lung adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2130741221,"Expression of many proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease results in the appearance of misfolded species that readily adopt alternate folded states. In vivo, these appear as punctated subcellular structures typically referred to as aggregates or inclusion bodies. Whereas groupings of these distinct proteins into a common morphological class have been useful conceptually, there is some suggestion that aggregates are not homogeneous and can exhibit a range of biological properties. In this study, we use dynamic imaging analysis of living cells to compare the aggregation and growth properties of mutant huntingtin with polyglutamine expansions or mutant SOD1 (G85R/G93A) to examine the formation of aggregate structures and interactions with other cellular proteins. Using a dual conditional expression system for sequential expression of fluorescence-tagged proteins, we show that mutant huntingtin forms multiple intracellular cytoplasmic and nuclear structures composed of a dense core inaccessible to nascent polypeptides surrounded by a surface that stably sequesters certain transcription factors and interacts transiently with molecular chaperones. In contrast, mutant SOD1 (G85R/G93A) forms a distinct aggregate structure that is porous, through which nascent proteins diffuse. These results reveal that protein aggregates do not correspond to a single common class of subcellular structures, and rather that there may be a wide range of aggregate structures, perhaps each corresponding to the specific disease-associated protein with distinct consequences on the biochemical state of the cell.

Accumulation of abnormal protein deposits as aggregates or inclusion bodies is a common cytological feature of a number of disease states as represented by clinically related neurodegenerative diseases. The mutant proteins that initiate protein aggregates in many of these diseases have been identified: Aβ in Alzheimer disease, PrP in prion diseases, α-synuclein in Parkinson disease, huntingtin in Huntington disease, tau in tauopathy, and SOD1 in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (1.Taylor J.P.

Although these proteins do not share distinctive common features in their respective primary sequences, they have all been shown to adopt alternate conformational states and form misfolded protein structures that appear visually as aggregates and inclusion bodies that correlate with disease pathology.

Elucidating the molecular events that occur during a process of recruitment, therefore, becomes essential to understand the mechanisms underlying protein aggregate pathology. Seeding, growth, and recruitment properties of protein aggregates have been investigated extensively in vitro using purified recombinant proteins and has led to an understanding of intrinsic self-assembly pathways (26.Scherzinger E.

However, to what extent are these in vitro observations informative of the in vivo events associated with the appearance and formation of aggregates in the cell? A major distinction between aggregate formation in vitro and in vivo is the presence of a plethora of other proteins within the cell of diverse conformational states and sequence composition. Consequently, the properties of aggregates will be influenced by multiple factors such as intrinsic rate of self-association, small molecule ligands, post-translational modifications, association with other cellular proteins that share related structural motifs, interactions with molecular chaperones, and association with degradation machinery (11.Muchowski P.J.

We have shown previously that heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) associates transiently with the surface of polyglutamine aggregates and suggested that the activity of this chaperone reflects the presence of non-native substrates to which Hsp70 binds on the aggregate surface (14.Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro studies show that the interaction of TBP with huntingtin is, indeed, prevented by Hsp70 (16.Schaffar G. Breuer P. Boteva R. Behrends C. Tzvetkov N. Strippel N. Sakahira H. Siegers K. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This also suggests that protein aggregates in vivo may contain specific sites and surfaces to which nascent proteins become associated, whether transiently or irreversibly. Here, we show that the intracellular structures of mutant huntingtin aggregates consist of distinct layers with an inner dense core and a recruitment surface to which nascent proteins become associated in transfected cultured cells. Since these layers are not exchangeable with each other, mutant huntingtin proteins in the core are completely separated from cellular proteins. In contrast, mutant SOD1 (G85R/G93A) forms porous structures into which nascent proteins can diffuse and associate. These results demonstrate, for the first time, in a comparative analysis that different disease-associated proteins form distinct classes of aggregate structures and consequently associate differentially with other cellular proteins. Constructs—The pEYFP-N1-TBP and pEYFP-N1-HSP70 constructs were previously described (14.Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). pEYFP-C1-CBP was generated by subcloning BamHI-digested CBP fragment from pRc/RSV-mCBP-HA-RK (37.Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) into the BglII site of pEYFP-C1. The pTRE-YFP or pTRE-CFP vectors were generated by PCR amplification of YFP from pEYFP-N1 or CFP from pECFP-N1 (Clontech, BD Biosciences) using the forward primer 5′-TTTCAGCTGCAGGCTAGCGCTAGCAAGGGCGAGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTAGCTAGCACGCGTTTACTTGTACAGCTCG-3′ and subcloning into the PvuII/MluI sites of pTRE2hyg (Clontech, BD Biosciences, CA). To construct pTRE-httQ78-YFP, pTRE-httQ78-CFP, and pTRE-httQ23-YFP, the respective BamHI/SphI-digested httQ150 or httQ23 fragments from pcDNA3-Q150 or pcDNA3-Q23 (gift from Dr. M. Macdonald (Harvard University)) were subcloned into the BamHI/PvuII sites of pTRE-YFP or pTRE-CFP vector. DNA sequence analysis revealed a deletion of the httQ150 construct from 150 CAG repeats to 78 repeats, resulting in pTRE-httQ78-YFP and pTRE-httQ78-CFP. pTRE-SOD1-wt-YFP, pTRE-SOD1-wt-CFP, pTRE-SOD1-G85R-YFP, and pTRE-SOD1-G85R-CFP were generated by PCR amplification of wild type SOD1 and G85R mutant SOD1 from plQL01 or plQL03 (gift from Dr. Q. Liu, Harvard Medical School), respectively, using the forward primer 5′-CTCCACCGCGGATCCATGGCGACGAAGGCCGTGTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTTCAGCTGCAGTTGGGCGATCCCAATTACAC-3′ and inserting into BamHI/PvuII sites of pTRE-YFP or pTRE-CFP. pTRE-SOD1-G93A-YFP and pTRE-SOD1-G93A-CFP were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the forward primer 5′-GTGACTGCTGACAAAGATGCTGTGGCCGATGTGTCTATTG-3′ and the reverse complement primer 5′-CAATAGACACATCGGCCACAGCATCTTTGTCAGCAGTCAC-3′ to change glycine at amino acid residue 93 to alanine of pTRE-SOD1-wt-YFP or pTRE-SOD1-wt-CFP. The pLac/MCS vector was generated by introducing a multiple cloning site into the NotI site of pOPRSVCAT (Stratagene) using the synthesized oligonucleotides, 5′-GGCCGGTACCAGATCTCATATGGATATCCTCGAGACGCGTTCTAGAGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCTCTAGAACGCGTCTCGAGGATATCCATATGAGATCTGGTACC-3′. The pLac-httQ78-YFP, pLac-httQ78-CFP, pLac-SOD1-G85R-YFP, and pLac-SOD1-G93A-YFP were generated by insertion of BamHI/BglII-digested httQ78-YFP, httQ78-CFP, SOD1-G85R-YFP, or SOD1-G93A-YFP fragments from the respective pTRE-constructs into the BglII site of pLacO/MCS. The BamHI fragment containing the lac operator-2 was subsequently removed from each construct, since we observed an enhanced level of induction with this deletion. The pLac-TBP-YFP and pLac-Hsp70-YFP were generated by subcloning a BglII/NotI-digested TBP-YFP fragment from pEYFP-N1-TBP or Hsp70-YFP fragment from pEYFP-N1-Hsp70 into the BglII/NotI sites of pLac/MCS. To construct pLac-CBP-YFP, pLac-EYFP-C1 was first generated by cloning the NheI/BclI-digested YFP fragment from pEYFP-C1 (Clontech, BD Biosciences) into blunt-ended HindIII/BglII sites of pLacO/MCS. The pLac-CBP-YFP was then constructed by subcloning a BamHI-digested CBP fragment from pRc/RSV-mCBP-HA-RK into the BglII site of pLac-EYFP-C1. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Sequential Expression by the Dual Conditional Protein Expression System—HeTOFLI cells were generated by transfecting HeLa Tet-Off cells (Clontech, BD Biosciences) with the pCMV-LacI-NLS construct (Stratagene) using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) and selecting with 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin. The HeTOFLI cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.2 mg/ml G418, and 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. For co-localization studies, cells were grown in 2-well glass slide chambers (Lab-Tek). For live cell analysis, cells were grown in 35-mm glass bottom cell culture dishes (MatTek Corp.). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine-PLUS reagent, as described in the protocol provided by the manufacturer. pTRE- and pLacO-constructs were co-transfected into HeTOFLI cells at ratios of 2:3. pTRE- and pEYFP-constructs were co-transfected into HeTOFLI cells at ratio of 2:1. For sequential expression, the transfected HeTOFLI cells were incubated for 24 h in the absence of doxycycline, and then the protein expression from the tetracycline response element (TRE) promoter was down-regulated by adding 1 μg/ml doxycycline, and expression from the Lac promoter was simultaneously induced by adding 30 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Samples were analyzed 12 h after the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Visualization of YFP- and CFP-tagged Protein and Live Cell Imaging—Transfected HeTOFLI cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, quenched in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 5 min, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature, and mounted in Vectashield anti-fading solution (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Fixed samples were examined using a Leica TCS SP2/Leica DM-IRE2 inverted confocal microscope equipped with a × 63 oil objective lens (Leica Microsystems Inc.). For live cell imaging, cells were maintained at 37 °C for the duration of the experiment. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 Axiovert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc.) as described previously with the following modifications: an area of 12.5 μm2 was photobleached for 3 s (20 iterations) with 514-nm laser wavelength at 100% laser power, and single scan images were collected before and every 3 s after photobleaching at 5× zoom power (14.Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) analysis was performed using a Leica TCS SP2/Leica DM-IRE2 inverted confocal microscope equipped with × 63 oil objective lens, and images were taken at 4× zoom before photobleaching and every 30 s while photobleaching an 8.4-μm2 region continuously with 514-nm laser wavelength at 100% laser power. Average fluorescence intensity of the aggregates in FRAP and FLIP analysis was determined using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) for FRAP and FLIP was determined using the equation, RFI = ((Net/N1t)/(Ne0/N10)) × 100, where Net is the average intensity of an aggregate at a given time point and N1t is the average intensity of a nonphotobleached area of the aggregate at the corresponding time points as a control for general photobleaching (14.Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 38.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Ne0 and N10 represent the average intensity before photobleaching of the bleached or nonbleached area, respectively. RFI values are the average of at least three data points. All images were processed by Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc.). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Analysis—FRET analysis was carried out with Leica inverted microscope (DM-IRE2) with a × 63 objective. CFP (430-nm excitation/470-nm emission), YFP (500-nm excitation/535-nm emission) and FRET (430-nm excitation/535-nm emission) channel images were taken with the beam splitter 86002v2 JP4 for CFP (excitation 430/25 nm and emission 470/30 nm) and YFP (excitation 500/20 nm and emission 535/30 nm) (Chroma Technology Corp.). The acquired images were then analyzed using Metamorph imaging software with the equation, FRETC = (FRET - 95) - 0.46(CFP - 95) - 0.016(YFP - 100) - 8 (14.Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P.

J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The FRET ratio image was then generated by calculating the ratio between FRETC (corrected FRET) and CFP images, ranging from 0 to 3. Detection of “Ring” Structures Formed by Co-expression of TBP, CBP, and Hsp70 with httQ78—To monitor the properties of huntingtin aggregates and their growth in vivo, we expressed the amino-terminal fragment of huntingtin shown to be associated with the appearance of aggregates and inclusions in Huntington disease (40.Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Hayden M.R. Nat.

Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). These huntingtin constructs containing 78 glutamine repeats and tagged with either YFP or CFP (httQ78-YFP, httQ78-CFP) or 23 glutamine repeats (httQ23-YFP) were used to examine interactions with the polyglutamine aggregate-associated proteins, TBP (TBP-YFP), CBP (YFP-CBP), and Hsp70 (Hsp70-YFP). These chimera proteins are functional as previously described (14.Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1099-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Co-expression of httQ78-YFP and httQ78-CFP resulted in the appearance of aggregates with both proteins uniformly distributed throughout (Fig. 1A), whereas HttQ23-YFP and Hsp70-YFP were diffuse in the cytosol, and TBP-YFP and YFP-CBP were localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1, F-I). The subcellular distribution of httQ23-YFP, TBP-YFP, YFP-CBP, and Hsp70-YFP are all strikingly altered, however, when co-expressed with httQ78-CFP. For TBP, CBP, and Hsp70, their subcellular localization is visualized by confocal microscopy in nearly all cells (81, 100, and 94%, respectively, for TBP, CBP, and Hsp70) as a “ring” surrounding a core structure composed of the huntingtin aggregate (Fig. 1, C-E). Co-localization of these transcription factors is not due to the presence of YFP, since YFP alone does not associate with the huntingtin aggregate but rather is excluded from the aggregates (supplemental Fig. S1A). Moreover, endogenous TBP (supplemental Fig. S1B) and CBP (18.Nucifora Jr., F.C. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Troncoso J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2423-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) also colocalize with the “ring” structure of huntingtin aggregates, demonstrating that recruitment of the transcription factors is due to the intrinsic properties of these transcription factors rather than a consequence of chimeras with YFP or CFP. In contrast, httQ23-YFP co-associated with httQ78-CFP only in the core and did not form ring structures similar to the pattern of co-localization observed for httQ78 self-association (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results suggest that the structure of the aggregate core is composed preferentially of huntingtin protein with polyglutamine expansions. TBP and CBP appear to be excluded from this core despite both transcription factors containing polyglutamine expansions. This suggests that the process in which cellular proteins are recruited to a polyglutamine aggregate must be influenced strongly by other properties of cellular proteins, such as the sequences adjacent to the polyglutamine expansion or other structural features. Establishing a Dual Conditional System for the Sequential Expression of Proteins Recruited to the Surface of Huntingtin Aggregates—To test directly whether huntingtin aggregates have localized surfaces for recruitment of nascent proteins, it was necessary to establish a dual conditional protein expression system to allow for the sequential expression of CFP- or YFP-tagged proteins. The dual conditional protein expression system employed the Tet-off and Lac regulatory systems in which tTA and LacO-NLS stably expressing HeLa cells (HeTOFLI) was used to express two different genes under the control of the TRE or RSV-LacO (Lac) promoters (supplemental Fig. S2). With this system, we reasoned that it would then be possible to address whether proteins either co-expressed or sequentially expressed formed homogenous or heterogeneous aggregate structures. The initial expression of httQ78 would allow formation of a visual seeding structure, and the subsequent expression of an aggregate-associated protein would allow us to address the process of protein recruitment. In vivo sequential imaging analysis was performed on cells cotransfected with pTRE-httQ78-CFP and either pLac-TBP-YFP, pLac-YFP-CBP, or pLac-Hsp70-YFP. HttQ78-CFP was expressed for 24 h, after which its expression was repressed, and the expression of TBP-YFP, YFP-CBP, or Hsp70-YFP was subsequently induced. Newly synthesized TBP-YFP and YFP-CBP were recruited efficiently to the exterior surface of nuclear aggregates and detected as YFP “ring” structures surrounding a CFP huntingtin core (Fig. 2, A-C). The appearance of TBP-YFP “ring” structures was less frequently detected in cytoplasmic or perinuclear aggregates than in nuclear aggregates (Fig. 2B), consistent with the expectation that interactions between huntingtin aggregates and transcription factors is a more frequent event in the nuclear compartment. In contrast, Hsp70-YFP was detected on the surface of both nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that the “ring” structures observed in cells expressing poly(Q)-containing proteins are, indeed, due to recruitment of cellular proteins to the exterior surface of the aggregate and moreover that the huntingtin aggregate continues to recruit other cellular protein even when express"
https://openalex.org/W2102456426,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors that heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor and then modulate at the transcriptional level the function of many target genes. Three PPARs are known: alpha, beta (sometimes called delta), and gamma. The better studied are PPARalpha and PPARgamma, which are activated by fibrates and thiazolidinediones/glitazones, respectively. It is now believed that activation of the PPARs could be associated with the prevention of heart attack and stroke in humans. Here we report, for the first time, that human platelets contain PPARbeta and that its selective activation inhibits platelet aggregation. PPARbeta is a putative receptor for prostacyclin. Prostacyclin is an important antithrombotic hormone that synergizes with nitric oxide to inhibit platelet aggregation. In the current study, we show that PPARbeta ligands similarly synergize with nitric oxide to inhibit platelet aggregation. These observations challenge our view of a nuclear receptor because PPARbeta is present and active in nonnucleated platelets. Furthermore, these data suggest that some of the antithrombotic actions of prostacyclin may be mediated via activation of PPARs. Thus, our results identify PPARbeta as a novel antiplatelet target that may mediate some of the effects of prostacyclin in blood."
https://openalex.org/W2086931364,"The 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins associated with endoribonuclease RNase L are components of the interferon-regulated OAS/RNase L system, which is an RNA decay pathway known to play an important role in the innate antiviral immunity. A large body of evidence suggests a critical role for the 1b isoform of the mouse <i>Oas</i> gene (<i>Oas1b</i>) in resistance to West Nile virus (WNV) infection <i>in vivo</i>. WNV is a positive, single-stranded RNA virus responsible for severe encephalitis in a large range of animal species and humans. To investigate the molecular basis for the sensitivity of WNV to the Oas1b antiviral pathway, we established a stable mouse fibroblastic cell clone that up-regulates Oas1b protein expression under the control of the Tet-Off expression system. We showed that murine cells respond to Oas1b expression by efficiently inhibiting WNV replication. The antiviral action of Oas1b was essentially restricted to the early stages in virus life cycle. We found that the inability of WNV to productively infect the Oas1b-expressing cells was attributable to a dramatic reduction in positive-stranded viral RNA level. Thus, Oas1b represents an antiviral pathway that exerts its inhibitory effect on WNV replication by preventing viral RNA accumulation inside infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2144359625,"Muscular dystrophies include a diverse group of genetically heterogeneous disorders that together affect 1 in 2000 births worldwide. The diseases are characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting that lead to severe disability and often premature death. Rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy (rmd) is a new recessive mouse mutation that causes a rapidly progressive muscular dystrophy and a neonatal forelimb bone deformity. The rmd mutation is a 1.6-kb intragenic deletion within the choline kinase beta (Chkb) gene, resulting in a complete loss of CHKB protein and enzymatic activity. CHKB is one of two mammalian choline kinase (CHK) enzymes (α and β) that catalyze the phosphorylation of choline to phosphocholine in the biosynthesis of the major membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine. While mutant rmd mice show a dramatic decrease of CHK activity in all tissues, the dystrophy is only evident in skeletal muscle tissues in an unusual rostral-to-caudal gradient. Minor membrane disruption similar to dysferlinopathies suggest that membrane fusion defects may underlie this dystrophy, because severe membrane disruptions are not evident as determined by creatine kinase levels, Evans Blue infiltration, and unaltered levels of proteins in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. The rmd mutant mouse offers the first demonstration of a defect in a phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme causing muscular dystrophy, representing a unique model for understanding mechanisms of muscle degeneration.

The rmd mutant mouse offers the first demonstration of a defect in a phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme causing muscular dystrophy, representing a unique model for understanding mechanisms of muscle degeneration. Muscular dystrophies are a variable class of more than 20 human disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness resulting from myofiber degeneration and regeneration. Histologically, variation in myofiber size with centrally localized nuclei, fibrosis, and fatty infiltration are common features (1O'Brien K.F. Kunkel L.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 74: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Emery A.E.H. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2002; 12: 343-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Despite their common pathologies, the genetic causes, severity, age of onset, and inheritance patterns vary widely among the dystrophies. The Muscular Dystrophy Association currently lists over 40 neuromuscular diseases as targets for its research programs and categorizes them by phenotypic characteristics such as age of onset, affected muscle groups, and inheritance pattern (Muscular Dystrophy Association, www.mdausa.org). In the last 10 years, the genetic mapping and identification of novel skeletal muscle genes, including cytoskeletal, cytosolic, nuclear membrane, sarcolemmal and extracellular matrix proteins, has dramatically changed this phenotype-based classification and provided clues as to the molecular basis of these disorders (3Cohn R.D. Campbell K.P. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 1456-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). What was once considered a single disease entity such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 4The abbreviations used are: LGMD, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy; B6, C57BL/6J; CHK, choline kinase; Chkb, choline kinase β; Chka, choline kinase α; CK, creatine kinase; COX, cytochrome-c oxidase; CPT, CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase; Cpt1b, carnitine palmitoyltransferase type 1b; DGC, dystrophin-glycoprotein complex; EBD, Evans Blue dye; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; rmd, rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy. has now been subdivided into seven different molecularly defined autosomal dominant (LGMD1A–1G) and ten autosomal recessive (LGMD2A–2J) diseases. Not surprisingly, many of these genes have converged to define pathways critical for the normal functioning and maintenance of skeletal muscles. The fact that many muscular dystrophy cases exist in which mutations to known dystrophy-causing genes have not been detected suggests that this discovery period in human and model organism genetics will continue to identify novel disease genes and mechanisms. The most common forms of muscular dystrophy result from mutations in genes coding for sarcolemmal and extracellular matrix proteins in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) (4Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), which acts as a linker between the cytoskeleton of the muscle cell and the extracellular matrix, thus providing mechanical support to the plasma membrane during myofiber contraction (5Michele D.E. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15457-15460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The association of a large number of muscular dystrophies with the DGC reflects the need to maintain the structural integrity of the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle. Disruption of DGC components results in a loss of membrane stability and subsequent degeneration of muscle fibers (3Cohn R.D. Campbell K.P. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 1456-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Recently, defects in post-translational glycosylation of membrane proteins have been shown to be causative factors in muscle-eye-brain disease, Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, Walker-Warburg syndrome, congenital muscular dystrophy type 1C, and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (6Michele D.E.

In most mammalian tissues, plasma membrane disruption is a common form of injury due to mechanical stress, and resealing of the damaged membrane is critical for cell survival (9McNeil P.L. Miyake K.

Defects in the dysferlin gene result in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and its allelic disease Miyoshi myopathy (12Liu J. Aoki M. Illa I. Wu C. Fardeau M. Angelini C. Serrano C.

We have identified a new spontaneous recessive mouse mutation that leads to a progressive muscular dystrophy with a rostral-to-caudal gradient of severity (rmd, rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy) and a neonatal forelimb bone deformity. By positional cloning we have identified the molecular defect in rmd mutant mice as an intragenic deletion in the choline kinase beta (Chkb) gene, one of two mammalian choline kinase (CHK) enzymes (α and β). The monomeric CHK proteins combine to form the homoor hetero-dimeric active forms (15Aoyama C. Liao H. Ishidate K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 266-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) that catalyze the phosphorylation of choline to phosphocholine in the first committed step in the Kennedy pathway (the cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-choline pathway) for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16Ishidate K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PC is the major phospholipid component of the eukaryotic plasma membrane external leaflet (17Daleke D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), an important precursor for many signaling molecules (18Cui Z. Houweling M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and is thought to be essential for mammalian survival (19Walkey C.J. Yu L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

The immediate biosynthetic product of CHK, phosphocholine, may also be an important secondary messenger in regulating cell growth signaling and proliferation (21Kiss Z. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The rmd mouse offers the first demonstration that a defect in a phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme can cause muscular dystrophy, suggesting that membrane phospholipids as well as sarcolemma-associated proteins are critical to the disease process. Mutant rmd mice share several phenotypic features with dysferlin-null mouse models that have a primary defect in sarcolemma repair and are a model for human limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B). Our discovery of a mouse mutation in Chkb will provide important insights into the phospholipid biosynthetic pathways necessary for the development and maintenance of healthy muscle tissue. Construction of a High Resolution Genetic Cross and Positional Cloning—The rmd mutation arose in an F2 intercross between N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized C57BL/6J (B6) mice and BALB/cByJ (BALB) mice in a mapping cross for an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced seizure mutation (Szt1) (22Yang Y. Beyer B.J. Otto J.F. O'Brien T.P. Letts V.A. White H.S. Frankel W.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A high resolution mapping cross was established between the original affected hybrid B6CF1-Chkbrmd/Cx mutant and B6. The original affected rmd/rmd mice were unable to breed, and therefore, the rmd line was rescued by transplanting the ovaries of an rmd/rmd female into a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) C3H/HeJ-Prkdcscid female. The recipient was mated with a B6 male, resulting in +/rmd heterozygous F1 offspring, which were mated for use in positional cloning and recombination analysis of the resulting F2 offspring. A second mapping cross with CAST/Ei was also established in the same manner. Histological Tissue Analysis—The original ovary donor female B6CF1 rmd/rmd mouse (409d), along with two B6CF2 rmd/rmd mice (aged 66 and 134 days) were perfused with Bouin’s fixative and embedded in paraffin, and tissue sections (8 μm) were examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of hindlimb and forelimb muscle cross-sections, along with sections of diaphragm, intercostal muscles, heart, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve. Quadriceps muscle from 6-, 14-, 26-, and 59-day +/+ and rmd/rmd mice (2 each per age) were processed as above with H&E. Centralized and non-centralized nuclei were counted in five random fields (20× or 40×) per mouse per age. Fiber diameter was measured in 20 fibers each in each random field using a Nikon E600 microscope equipped with Nikon Plan Fluor 4×/0.13, 20×/0.50, and 40×/0.75 objectives and a SPOT RT color digital camera and imaging software version 3.3.3 (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Skeletal preparations of B6CF2 +/+ and rmd/rmd mice (2 each, 6 days) were performed according to the methods of O’Brien (23O'Brien T.P. Metallinos D.L. Chen H. Shin M.K. Tilghman S.M. Genetics. 1996; 143: 447-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where bone is stained red and cartilage is stained blue. Briefly, mice were skinned, eviscerated, fixed for 4 days in 100% ETOH, then placed in 100% acetone for 3 days and rinsed with water. Mice were stained 15 days (2 volumes of 0.14% Alcian blue 8Gx, 1 volume of 0.12% alizarin red, 8 volumes of 100% glacial acetic acid, and 50 volumes of 70% ETOH), after which they were transferred to a clearing solution (20% glycerol, 1% KOH) until tissue was completely cleared and then transferred to storage solution (glycerol:ETOH:benzyl alcohol, 2:2:1). Electron Microscopy—Hindlimb, forelimb, and heart muscle from B6CF2 +/+ and rmd/rmd mice (1 each, aged 30 days) were collected and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and 100 nm sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope for mitochondrial abnormalities and accumulation of fusion vesicles on the sub-sarcolemmal membrane. In addition, a second pair of B6CF4 +/+ and rmd/rmd mice (1 each, aged 52 days) were perfused with 3.8% acrolein and fixed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, and 90 nm sections were examined as above. Membrane Integrity—B6.CN9F1 +/+ and rmd/rmd animals (two each, aged 40 days) were injected with Evans Blue Dye (EBD, 10 mg/ml stock in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.2-μm filter sterilized) intraperitoneally (1 mg/10 g of body weight), along with two (66 days) A/J mice (a dysferlin-deficient model of LGMD2B), and one (39 day) mdx animal (known to show infiltration of EBD into muscle fibers) as a positive control. After 12–16 h, animals were euthanized and skinned, and muscles were examined for uptake of EBD. Whole sections of quadriceps muscle were frozen in optimal cutting temperature embedding compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Torrence, CA) in isopentane chilled in liquid nitrogen, and 8-μm sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy for fluorescent dye uptake into cells. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Frozen muscle sections (8 μm) from the Evans Blue membrane integrity experiments were thawed, fixed 4 min in 1:1 acetone:methanol (for dysferlin only), rinsed twice for 5 min in TBST, blocked for 1 h in 5% NGS-TBST, incubated overnight at 4 °C in 1:20 dilution of anti-dysferlin (Hamlet) or anti-dystrophin (DYS2) mouse monoclonal antibody (Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) in blocking solution, rinsed 3× for 5 min, incubated 1 h at 25°C with 1:100 dilution of Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-mouse secondary (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR), rinsed 3× for 5 min, and visualized as above. Creatine Kinase Levels—Blood samples were collected from +/+ and rmd/rmd mice (two each, aged 44 (B6CF4) and 53 days (B6CF2)) and centrifuged, and serum was analyzed for CK levels. Mitochondrial Function—Skeletal muscle tissue samples from B6CF2 +/+ and rmd/rmd animals (two each, aged 31 days) were frozen in optimal cutting temperature embedding compound in isopentane chilled in liquid nitrogen, sectioned (8 μm), blocked with normal goat serum plus anti-mouse antibody, incubated with anti-mouse COX IV monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 25°C,and followed by 1-h incubation with fluorophore-conjugated Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at 25 °C. Immunofluorescence was observed as previously described. Northern Blot Analysis and Quantitative Real-time PCR—Northern blots prepared from 1 μg of poly(A+) hindlimb muscle RNA from +/+ and rmd/rmd littermates (one each, 63 days, B6CF2), or from 10 μg of forelimb and hindlimb muscle, heart, liver, and brown fat total RNA from +/+ and rmd/rmd littermates (one each, 35 days, B6.CN6F1) were probed with a 291-bp probe (Strip-EZ DNATM, Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) encompassing exons 10 and 11 of the Chkb mRNA: forward, 5′-GGCATCTCACTTTTTCTGGGGT-3′ and reverse, 5′-TAAGAAAAGGCTACAGAGGTCGGCTA-3′. To account for differential loading, we probed for housekeeping gene expression using an 847-bp probe to Abt1 (activator of basal transcription): forward, 5′-GACCCCAGATCTTGCCATG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCACCAGGAGTCCCTTATTG-3′. Taqman minor groove binder primers and probes were designed using Primer Express™ (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) based on the cDNA sequences of Chka (91 bp; F = 5′-ACTAGATCTCCAGTTGTATTTTGTCATAATG-3′, R = 5′-GCTTCCGCCTTTCAGAGTTCT-3′, probe = 5′-VIC-TGTCAAGAAGGTAATATC-3′), Chkb (91 bp; F = 5′-GCAGGCTTCGATGTCCACTATAG-3′, R = 5′-CGTCAGCTGGCCCTTCTG-3′, probe = 5′-VIC-CGTCAGCTGGCCCTTCTG-3′), and Cpt1b (92 bp; F = 5′-GATCTGCATGTTTGACCCAAAA-3′, R = 5′-AAGAGACCCCGTAGCCATCA-3′, probe = 5′-VIC-TTTGGTCCCGTGGCGG-3′). The internal control was the mouse endogenous TATA-box binding protein (TATA) Taqman probe set (Mm00446973_m1, Applied Biosystems). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA from +/+ and rmd/rmd (two each, aged 35 and 36 days, B6.CN6F1) tissues (forelimb, hindlimb, heart, liver, kidney, and brown fat) with RETROscript™ First Strand Synthesis Kit for RT-PCR (Ambion). All quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed on an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) in 20-μl volumes using the standard quantitative real-time PCR reaction conditions (as per the company manual). Indirect Immunoblotting of Sarcolemmal Membrane Proteins—Forelimb and hindlimb muscle (200 mg each) from B6CF4 +/+ and rmd/rmd mice (2 each, aged 40 and 57 days) were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle, suspended in 1.0 ml of SDS solubilization buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 55 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, including 1 ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Cat # P-8340, Sigma-Aldrich)) per 10 ml of buffer. Suspensions were vortexed, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 2 min. Protein content of the supernatants was determined by the Bradford method (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1999Google Scholar) using Coomassie Plus Protein Assay (Pierce). Approximately 100 μg of protein from each sample were mixed with Laemmli buffer (final concentration, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% (v/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and 30 μl each was loaded into 15% Tris-HCl gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and run for 2 h at 200 V. Gels were transferred to Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) by semi-dry blotting, blots were probed with mouse monoclonal primary antibodies to dystrophin, β-dystroglycan, emerin, dysferlin, α-sarcoglycan, and β-sarcoglycan (Novocastra), and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Bands were visualized with Western blotting Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphatidylcholine Lipid Quantification and Choline Kinase Activity in rmd Tissues—Tissues (forelimb and hindlimb muscles, heart, brain, liver, kidney, ovary, testes, and blood plasma) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen from three each B6.CN6F1 +/+, +/rmd, and rmd/rmd animals (27–44 days) and were analyzed for choline kinase activity and phospholipid content. Choline Kinase Assay—Mouse tissues were homogenized in 3 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 154 mm KCl, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (including 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Complete protease inhibitor, Roche Applied Science)/50 ml) with a Teflon-pestle/glass homogenizer and supernatant fractions (348,000 × g 15 min) were prepared. The CHK activity was determined as described elsewhere (25Ishidate K. Nakazawa Y. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The supernatant fractions were incubated in a final volume of 100-μl reaction buffer that contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.75, 10 μm ATP-2Na, 15 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 mm [3H]choline chloride (10.5 μCi/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction product, phosphocholine, was separated using AG1-X8 (200–400 mesh, OH- form) column (Bio-Rad). To determine the activity of each CHK form, supernatant fractions were treated with an antisera raised against GST (control), GST-CHKA, or GST-CHKB fusion proteins combined with protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for CHK assay (26Aoyama C. Ohtani A. Ishidate K. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Determination of the Mass of Cholesterol, Cholesterol Ester, and Triacylglycerols in Liver and Plasma—Phospholipids in liver homogenates (0.5–1.0 mg of protein) or 15–40 μl of plasma was digested with phospholipase C for 2 h at 30°C. After adding tridecanoin (20 ng) as an internal standard, lipids were extracted and the masses of cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and triacylglycerol were determined by gas-liquid chromatography (27Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Pind S. Lipids. 1989; 24: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Determination of PC and PE Mass in Tissue Homogenates—Phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (12.5–25 mg) was added as an internal standard to tissue homogenates (0.5–1.0 mg of protein). Lipids were extracted from samples by the methods of Folch et al. (28Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phospholipids were separated and quantified by the high-performance liquid chromatography method of Bergo et al. with minor modifications (29Bergo M.O. Gavino B.J. Steenbergen R. Sturbois B. Parlow A.F. Sanan D.A. Skarnes W.C. Vance J.E. Young S.G. J. Biol.

Data Analysis—Means were compared with analysis of variance or t test using JMP for Macintosh (30SAS InstituteJMP Statistics and Graphics Guide, Version 5.1.2. SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC2004Google Scholar), and means were considered significantly different if p < 0.05. Phenotype and Histology of rmd Mutant Mice—A spontaneous recessive mutation, rmd, resulting in a hindlimb weakness and muscle wasting disease, was identified at The Jackson Laboratory. The disease phenotype of rmd/rmd mice is first observable starting at day 6 with mutant mice being visibly smaller than their non-affected littermates and showing an outward rotation of the forelimbs that results from defective bone morphology (Fig. 1A). Skeletal preparations of early forelimbs (P6) showed severe bowing (genu varum) of the ulna and radius (Fig. 1B), whereas hindlimb bone development did not appear to be affected. As the disease progresses, the hindlimb muscles become severely affected, and rmd mice lose significant hindlimb motor control by 2–3 months of age as indicated by dragging of hindlimbs. The forelimb muscles show only minor degeneration despite the forelimb bone abnormality, and therefore the mice are able to access food and water. Histological examination of the forelimb skeletal muscle reveals very little loss of muscle fibers by 66 days, although some variation in fiber diameter and centralized nuclei, characteristic of degeneration-regeneration of muscle fibers, are observed (Fig. 1, C and E). Hindlimb skeletal muscle, by contrast, reveals signs of severe muscular dystrophy, including centralized nuclei, fatty infiltration, and loss of muscle fibers (Fig. 1, D and F). The disease is extremely mild in the forelimbs, and at 1 year of age, forelimb muscles continue to show only minor defects with little loss of muscle fibers (Fig. 1, G and I). Hindlimb muscles, however, are severely affected at 1 year of age (Fig. 1, H and J). The percentage of fibers with centralized nuclei increased in rmd/rmd hindlimb muscle tissues from <2% at 1 week of age to 18% by just 8 weeks (Fig. 2A). During that same time, +/+ hindlimb muscles never showed >2% centralized nuclei. The size of individual fibers was significantly smaller in rmd/rmd than in +/+ hindlimb muscles at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, although the variation in fiber size was not different (Fig. 2B). The muscle degeneration does not appear to affect lifespan, because rmd/rmd mice have consistently survived beyond 18 months of age. There is no apparent cardiac or diaphragm involvement in aged (>300 days) rmd/rmd mice, and no morphological abnormalities have been observed in the spinal cord, sciatic nerves, retina, or neuromuscular junctions (data not shown), suggesting that rmd is not a model for neurodegenerative diseases. In Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, the loss of the dystrophin protein compromises the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, resulting in damage to the sarcolemmal membrane (31Bakker E. Van Ommen G.J.B. Neuromuscular Disorders: Clinical and Molecular Genetics.in: Emery A.E.H. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, England1998: 59-85Google Scholar). To determine if similar membrane damage occurs in the rmd dystrophy, we used Evans blue dye (EBD), a low molecular weight diazo dye that does not cross the sarcolemma into normal skeletal muscle fibers but will diffuse into muscle fibers of a number of models with impaired sarcolemmal integrity, including mdx mice, a dystrophin-deficient animal model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (32Straub V. Rafael J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). As expected, skeletal muscle from mdx mice showed pervasive blue coloring grossly, while in contrast, we found that skeletal muscle from both the +/+ or rmd/rmd animals showed no significant uptake of EBD. Examination of cryosections by fluorescence microscopy (EBD fluoresces red) revealed no EBD uptake in +/+ myofibers and only scattered single EBD-positive fibers in rmd/rmd or A/J-dysf muscles (Fig. 3A). In contrast, mdx myofibers display widespread uptake in numerous clusters of EBD-positive fibers. These data suggest that the Chkb defect does not lead to extensive damage to the sarcolemmal membrane and that, like dysferlin-deficient A/J mice, repair of normal contraction-induced membrane damage may be impaired. In a variety of muscular dystrophies, alterations or loss of protein components of the sarcolemmal membrane, or membrane repair vesicles, are observed. We tested the levels of membrane proteins by Western blotting of protein extracts from fore- and hindlimbs of +/+ and rmd/rmd mice with monoclonal antibodies to dystrophin, α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan, emerin, dysferlin, α-sarcoglycan, and β-sarcoglycan. None of these proteins showed any difference in their level of expression between +/+ and rmd/rmd animals (data not shown). In addition, frozen muscle sections of both rmd/rmd and +/+ animals shows normal immunofluorescent staining of dysferlin (Fig. 3B) and dystrophin (Fig. 3C) at the sarcolemma, suggesting that the rmd dystrophy is unlikely to be caused by secondary reductions of dysferlin or of members of the DGC integral sarcolemmal complex of proteins. In muscular dystrophies, serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) increase as the enzyme is released from tissues during muscle damage or necrosis. This is most evident in dystrophic mice with compromised sarcolemmal membrane integrity, where levels of plasma CK are significantly increased (>20-fold). In contrast, muscle fibers from dysferlin-null mice show only moderately increased CK levels (6-fold higher), even after extensive exercise, which causes CK levels in dystrophic mice to rise dramatically (33Bansal D. Miyake K. Vogel S.S. Groh S. Chen C.C. Williamson R. McNeil P.L. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2003; 423: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Blood samples from +/+ and mutant 6-week-old rmd mice had CK levels ∼3 times higher (average 6507 IU/liter) compared with +/+ littermates (average 2587 IU/liter). Together, CK levels, histology, and EBD membrane integrity results indicate that, although rmd mice develop a progressive muscular dystrophy, impaired sarcolemmal integrity does not appear to be a likely mechanism for the dystrophy. Ultrastructure studies of muscle fibers in several muscular dystrophies are diagnostic and can reveal abnormalities, including alterations in the z-band structure of the contractile sarcomere (34Ilkovski B. Cooper S.T. Nowak K. Ryan M.M. Yang N. Schnell C. Durling H.J. Roddick L.G. Wilkinson I. Kornberg A.J. Collins K.J. Wallace G. Gunning P. Hardeman E.C. Laing N.G. North"
https://openalex.org/W2162816784,"Tuftsin, Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg (TKPR), is an immunostimulatory peptide with reported nervous system effects as well. We unexpectedly found that tuftsin and a higher affinity antagonist, TKPPR, bind selectively to neuropilin-1 and block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding to that receptor. Dimeric and tetrameric forms of TKPPR had greatly increased affinity for neuropilin-1 based on competition binding experiments. On endothelial cells tetrameric TKPPR inhibited the VEGF<sub>165</sub>-induced autophosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) even though it did not directly inhibit VEGF binding to VEGFR-2. Homology between exon 8 of VEGF and TKPPR suggests that the sequence coded for by exon 8 may stabilize VEGF binding to neuropilin-1 to facilitate signaling through VEGFR-2. Given the overlap between processes involving neuropilin-1 and tuftsin, we propose that at least some of the previously reported effects of tuftsin are mediated through neuropilin-1."

https://openalex.org/W2107778633,"Increasing skeletal muscle carnitine content may alleviate the decline in muscle fat oxidation seen during intense exercise. Studies to date, however, have failed to increase muscle carnitine content, in healthy humans, by dietary or intravenous L-carnitine administration. We hypothesized that insulin could augment Na+-dependent skeletal muscle carnitine transport. On two randomized visits, eight healthy men underwent 5 h of intravenous L-carnitine infusion with serum insulin maintained at fasting (7.4+/-0.4 mIU*l(-1)) or physiologically high (149.2+/-6.9 mIU*l(-1)) concentrations. The combination of hypercarnitinemia (approximately 500 micromol*l(-1)) and hyperinsulinemia increased muscle total carnitine (TC) content from 22.0 +/- 0.9 to 24.7 +/- 1.4 mmol*(kg dm)(-1) (P<0.05) and was associated with a 2.3 +/- 0.3-fold increase in carnitine transporter protein (OCTN2) mRNA expression (P<0.05). Hypercarnitinemia in the presence of a fasting insulin concentration had no effect on either of these parameters. This study demonstrates that insulin can acutely increase muscle TC content in humans during hypercarnitinemia, which is associated with an increase in OCTN2 transcription. These novel findings may be of importance to the regulation of muscle fat oxidation during exercise, particularly in obesity and type 2 diabetes where it is known to be impaired."

https://openalex.org/W2005207709,"Cancer cells are insensitive to many signals that inhibit growth of untransformed cells. Here, we show that primary human epithelial cells expressing human papillomavirus (HPV) type-16 E6/E7 bypass arrest caused by the DNA-damaging drug adriamycin and become tetraploid. To determine the contribution of E6 in the context of E7 to the resistance of arrest and induction of tetraploidy, we used an E6 mutant unable to degrade p53 or RNAi targeting p53 for knockdown. The E6 mutant fails to generate tetraploidy; however, the presence of E7 is sufficient to bypass arrest while the p53 RNAi permits both arrest insensitivity and tetraploidy. We published previously that polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is upregulated in E6/E7-expressing cells. We observe here that abnormal expression of Plk1 protein correlates with tetraploidy. Using the p53 binding-defective mutant of E6 and p53 RNAi, we show that p53 represses Plk1, suggesting that loss of p53 results in tetraploidy through upregulation of Plk1. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of Plk1 in cells generates tetraploidy but does not confer resistance to arrest. These results support a model for transformation caused by HPV-16 where bypass of arrest and tetraploidy are separable consequences of p53 loss with Plk1 required only for the latter effect."
https://openalex.org/W2035780027,"Nontransferrin-bound iron (NTBI) has been detected in iron overload diseases. This form of iron may exert pro-oxidant effects and modulate cellular function and inflammatory response. The present study has aimed to investigate the effects of serum NTBI on monocyte adherence to endothelium. Measured by a recently developed high-throughput fluorescence-based assay, serum NTBI was found to be higher in both homozygotes of HFE C282Y mutation of hereditary hemochromatosis (7.9+/-0.6 microM, n=9, P<0.001) and heterozygotes (4.0+/-0.5 microM, n=8, P<0.001), compared with controls (1.6+/-0.2 microM, n=21). The effects of these sera on monocyte adhesion and endothelial activation were examined. Adhesion of normal human monocytes to C282Y homozygote- and heterozygote-serum-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells was higher (25.0+/-0.9 and 22.1+/-0.7%, respectively) compared with controls (17.6+/-0.5%, both P<0.001). For the three groups combined, the expression of adhesion molecules, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, was positively correlated to NTBI levels but not to the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein. Furthermore, accumulation of intracellular labile iron and oxidative radicals within the cells due to NTBI was evidenced. Finally, counteraction of NTBI-induced endothelial activation was observed using iron chelators. These findings therefore identify a physiological function of NTBI in monocyte-endothelial interactions that may also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1986136914,"Interaction between CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, and its ligand CD40L, a 39-kDa glycoprotein, is essential for the development of humoral and cellular immune responses1,2. Selective blockade or activation of this pathway provides the ground for the development of new treatments against immunologically based diseases3,4 and malignancies5,6. Like other members of the TNF superfamily, CD40L monomers self-assemble around a threefold symmetry axis to form noncovalent homotrimers that can each bind three receptor molecules7,8. Here, we report on the structure-based design of small synthetic molecules with C3 symmetry that can mimic CD40L homotrimers. These molecules interact with CD40, compete with the binding of CD40L to CD40, and reproduce, to a certain extent, the functional properties of the much larger homotrimeric soluble CD40L. Architectures based on rigid C3-symmetric cores may thus represent a general approach to mimicking homotrimers of the TNF superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2014371472,"The human cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase is composed of a catalytic subunit, UL54, and an accessory protein, UL44, which has a structural fold similar to that of other processivity factors, including herpes simplex virus UL42 and homotrimeric sliding clamps such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Several specific residues in the C-terminal region of UL54 and in the ""connector loop"" of UL44 are required for the association of these proteins. Here, we describe the crystal structure of residues 1-290 of UL44 in complex with a peptide from the extreme C terminus of UL54, which explains this interaction at a molecular level. The UL54 peptide binds to structural elements similar to those used by UL42 and the sliding clamps to associate with their respective binding partners. However, the details of the interaction differ from those of other processivity factor-peptide complexes. Crucial residues include a three-residue hydrophobic ""plug"" from the UL54 peptide and Ile<sup>135</sup> of UL44, which forms a critical intramolecular hydrophobic anchor for interactions between the connector loop and the peptide. As was the case for the unliganded UL44 structure, the UL44-peptide complex forms a head-to-head dimer that could potentially form a C-shaped clamp on DNA. However, the peptide-bound structure displays subtle differences in the relative orientation of the two subdomains of the protein, resulting in a more open clamp, which we predicted would affect its association with DNA. Indeed, filter binding assays revealed that peptide-bound UL44 binds DNA with higher affinity. Thus, interaction with the catalytic subunit appears to affect both the structure and function of UL44."

The mechanism that leads to COX-2 overexpression in this tumor type is unknown. We have now shown that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by LY294002 suppresses both basal and phorbol myristate acetate-induced COX-2 expression in TMK-1 and MKN-28 gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) by SB415286 induced expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein as well as the enzyme activity in the gastric cancer cells. The effect of SB415286 was confirmed by the use of two additional GSK-3β inhibitors, lithium chloride and SB216763. SB415286 had a modest 1.6-fold stimulatory effect on a 2-kb COX-2 promoter reporter construct, but more importantly, it was shown to block the decay of COX-2 mRNA. In contrast to modulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/GSK-3β pathway, inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MEK 1/2, p38, JNK) or the mammalian target of rapamycin did not alter COX-2 expression in gastric cancer cells.

Two distinct genes encode COX enzymes, referred to as COX-1 and COX-2. Expression of COX-1 is constitutive in most tissues, whereas expression of COX-2 is considered to be inducible by polypeptide growth factors, mediators of inflammation, and carcinogens. The major prostanoid produced by the epithelium and by malignancies derived from this cell type is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (9Hori T. Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Oku N. Miyazawa K.

In the present study, we investigated the signaling pathways that lead to increased COX-2 expression in gastric cancer cells and examined the molecular mechanisms underlying COX-2 overexpression. Cell Culture—Gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines originated either from intestinal-type (MKN-28) or from diffuse-type (TMK-1) tumors (a kind gift from Hiroshi Yokozaki, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan) (26Yokozaki H. Pathol. Int. 2000; 50: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PromoCell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics (Bio Whittaker) and maintained at 37 °C at 5% CO2 in air. Once these cells had reached ∼80% confluence, experiments were performed on fresh culture medium or medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. Signal Transduction Inhibitor Experiments—LY294002 (20 μm) was obtained from Cell Signaling Inc. (Beverly, MA), actinomycin D, bisindolylmaleimide I (2 μm), UO126 (10 μm), PD98059 (50 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), and JNK Inhibitor II (50 μm) were from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences Inc., Darmstadt, Germany). SB415286 (20 μm), SB216763 (20 μm), lithium chloride (30 mm), rapamycin (30 nm), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10 ng/ml) were from Sigma-Aldrich, and interleukin-1β (10 ng/ml) was from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The cells were treated with or without the signal transduction inhibitors with or without addition of PMA or interleukin-1β. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Northern blotting as previously described (14Ristimäki A. Honkanen N. Jänkälä H. Sipponen P. Härkönen M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1276-1280PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ristimäki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Loading was controlled by staining of ribosomal 28 S RNA with ethidium bromide. Real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—RNA was extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 1 μg of total RNA was converted to cDNA with Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) by random primers (Invitrogen) in a volume of 50 μl for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was heat inactivated (95 °C, 3 min) and filled to a final volume of 200 μl. Real-time PCR reactions were performed with the Gene Amp® 5700 Sequence detection system by use of Assays-on-Demand™ gene expression products according to the vendor’s protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). In brief, for each reaction 0.75–1.5 μlof cDNA template were mixed with 1.25 μl of COX-2 primers and probes labeled with a reporter dye (PTGS2, Assays-on-Demand™). TaqMan® Universal PCR Mastermix (12.5 μl) and RNase-free water were added to a total volume of 25 μl. Human TATA box-binding protein or 18 S rRNA served as an endogenous control to account for differences in reverse transcription of total RNA. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C denaturation for 15 s and 60 °C annealing/extension for 1 min. Each sample was measured in triplicate, and data were analyzed by the delta-delta method for comparing relative expression results (ratio, 2–[ΔCP sample–ΔCP control]) (27Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis as described earlier (12van Rees B.P. Sivula A. Thoren S. Yokozaki H. Jakobsson P.J. Offerhaus G.J. Ristimäki A. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, 30–70 μg of total protein extracts were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked (4 °C, overnight) with Tris-buffered saline-Nonidet P-40 containing 5% nonfat milk powder and then incubated (1 h, room temperature) with mouse monoclonal anti-human-COX-2 (1:1000, for TMK-1 cells), mouse monoclonal anti-COX-1 (1:500), rabbit polyclonal anti-mPGES-1, anti-mPGES-2, anti-cytosolic PGES (1:1000) (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI), goat polyclonal anti-β-actin (1:500) or goat polyclonal anti-human-COX-2 (1:1000, for MKN-28 cells) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or mouse monoclonal anti-phosphatase and tensin homologue (1:1000; Cell Signaling). Subsequently membranes were incubated with sheep anti-mouse, donkey anti-rabbit (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences), or donkey anti-goat (1:2000; Santa Cruz) antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting analysis system; Amersham Biosciences) or with SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL). The ratio of COX-2 to β-actin was calculated by quantitation of expression levels with Scion Image 1.57 software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Phospho- and Total Akt Immunodetection—Membrane blocking and antibody incubation was performed in Tris-buffered saline (0.1%)-Tween 20 solution containing 5% nonfat milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblotting was performed with polyclonal antibodies directed against phosphorylated Akt at Ser-473 or at Thr-308 (1:1000; Cell Signaling) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20, the membranes were probed with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:2000; Cell Signaling) for 1 h at room temperature. To confirm equal loading, the membranes were first reprobed with polyclonal sheep antibody that recognizes Akt1 regardless of its phosphorylation status (1:1000) and then with rabbit anti-sheep horseradish peroxidase conjugate secondary antibody (1:2000; both Upstate Inc., Charlottesville, VA). Proteins were visualized with SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce) and the MultiImage™ FC Light Cabinet/FluorChem™ 8800 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Akt Kinase Activity Assay—TMK-1 cells were cultured in 25-cm2 cell culture flasks until 80% confluence. The cells were incubated in plain culture medium or with LY294002 (20 μm) for 24 h. Cell extracts were made according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Akt activity assay kit; Calbiochem). Briefly, TMK-1 cells were trypsinized, pelleted, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in ice-cold kinase extraction buffer. The pellet was incubated on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Akt antibody (2 μl) was first added to the cell lysates containing a total of 300 μg of protein extract and incubated in continuous rotation for 45 min at room temperature. Akt-antibody complexes were collected by rotating them with protein-A agarose for 1 h at room temperature. The immunocomplexes were pelleted and washed twice with the kinase extraction buffer and once with kinase assay buffer provided by the manufacturer (Calbiochem). The immunoprecipitate was then incubated with a recombinant GSK-3α protein in the presence of ATP at 30 °C for 3 h, after which 30 μl of the supernatant was collected and resuspended in 4× SDS sample buffer. Immunodetection was carried out by the same protocol as described for phospho-Akt but by use of an antibody specific for phospho-Ser-21 GSK-3α at a dilution of 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Equal loading was assured by use of rabbit polyclonal anti-GSK3α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:500. For both these primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody raised against rabbit was used at a dilution of 1:2000 (Amersham Biosciences). PGE2 Measurement—The cells were plated on 6- or 12-well cell culture dishes. These cultures were first preincubated with or without a selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (5 μm; Cayman Chemical), PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (20 μm), or GSK-3β inhibitor SB415286 (20 μm) for 2 h in 1–2 ml of the culture medium, after which incubation was continued with or without PMA (10 ng/ml) for 6–24 h. The medium was then removed, and the cells were washed once with RPMI 1640 and incubated further with 0.5–1 ml of AA (10 μm; Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI 1640 for 15–20 min. PGE2 was analyzed by using an enzyme immunoassay according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical). Transfection of Reporter Constructs—We used the COX-2 promoter (1840 bp upstream to 123 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site) in a pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) (28Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and a pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter construct as a transfection control (Promega). For transient transfection, cells were plated on 24-well tissue culture clusters at a split ratio of 1/5 to 1/10 and grown overnight. COX-2 promoter construct (0.2 μg) was co-transfected with the Renilla construct (0.04 μg) with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, FuGENE reagent was added to serum-free RPMI 1640 and incubated with plasmid DNA for 30 min at room temperature. A transfection reaction mixture was gently added to the cells containing 0.5 ml of complete growth medium. The transfection medium was removed after 4 h, and the cells were grown for 18 h in serum-reduced medium (0.5% fetal calf serum) containing the test agents. At the end of the incubation period, the transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and total proteins were lysed in passive lysis buffer (100 μl/well) provided by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured from the lysate by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system, and luminescence was measured with a DCR-1 luminometer (DiGENE Corp., Gaithersburg, MD). Firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase values to control for transfection efficiency. RNA Stability Experiments—Overnight serum-starved (0.5% fetal calf serum) cells were incubated for 2 h with SB415286 (20 μm), PMA (10 ng/ml), or vehicle (Me2SO). To inhibit DNA-dependent RNA synthesis, 5 μg/ml of actinomycin D (Calbiochem) was added, and total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) at the indicated time points. COX-2 mRNA and 18 S rRNA as a control were determined by real-time RT-PCR as described above. Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed by nonparametric Wilcoxon test. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant (InStat 2.01; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). We have recently characterized the expression of COX and PGES enzymes in human gastric cancer cells of the MKN series (12van Rees B.P. Sivula A. Thoren S. Yokozaki H. Jakobsson P.J. Offerhaus G.J. Ristimäki A. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We chose the MKN-28 cell line for further studies because >90% of its COX activity could be contributed to COX-2 and because PMA induced in this MKN cell type the highest induction of COX-2 protein expression and PGE2 synthesis. Here we describe another gastric cancer cell line, TMK-1, that produced relatively high basal PGE2 levels, which were further increased by PMA (Fig. 1A). The effects of PMA appeared to be independent of phospholipase A2 activation, because it induced a 12.9-fold increase in PGE2 production during a 24-h incubation period, which was comparable with a 10.8-fold induction when these cells were exposed to exogenous AA for 20 min after the initial 24-h incubation period. Furthermore, because the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (5 μm) inhibited ∼90% of AA-induced PGE2 release (Fig. 1B), our results show that the principal COX isoenzyme in TMK-1 cells is COX-2. PMA stimulated expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein in TMK-1 cells, and the peak steady-state level of the transcript was reached earlier (2–6 h) than that of the protein (6–24 h) (Fig. 1C). However, PMA did not modulate expression of COX-1 or any of the PGES enzymes tested (Fig. 1D, cytosolic PGES, mPGES-1, and mPGES-2). This suggests that COX-2 is the key enzyme in production of PGE2 in TMK-1 cells in both basal and PMA-induced conditions. Next, we investigated signal transduction pathways that could lead to COX-2 expression in gastric cancer cells. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 suppressed both basal and PMA-induced expression of COX-2 protein in TMK-1 and MKN-28 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). As shown in Fig. 2C, LY294002 also inhibited synthesis of PGE2, confirming that not only steady-state levels of the COX-2 protein but also the biologically active pool of COX-2 enzyme is reduced by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor. Consistent with our data suggesting that induction of COX-2 protein expression is dependent on modulation of COX-2 transcript levels (Fig. 1C), we found that PMA-induced COX-2 mRNA expression was inhibited by LY294002 in TMK-1 (2.7-fold) and MKN-28 (4.6-fold) cells as detected by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2, D and E). However, the basal COX-2 expression was affected only in MKN-28 cells (1.8-fold reduction; Fig. 2E). As PMA is known to exert its effects through protein kinase C activation, the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I was used. In contrast to the effect observed with LY294002, bisindolylmaleimide I inhibited only the PMA-induced COX-2 expression but did not suppress basal COX-2 expression (Fig. 3A). We also examined the contribution of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and found that inhibition of JNK by JNK Inhibitor II did not inhibit COX-2 expression (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, inhibition of MEK 1/2 by UO126 (or PD98059, data not shown) and p38 by SB203580 did not modulate COX-2 expression (Fig. 3C). Previous findings have shown that interleukin-1β treatment of AGS gastric cancer cells induces COX-2 expression via the p38 pathway (29Fan X.M. Wong B.C. Lin M.C. Cho C.H. Wang W.P. Kung H.F. Lam S.K. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 16: 1098-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our experiments indicate that interleukin-1β can induce COX-2 protein expression in TMK-1 cells, which was inhibited by SB203580. Thus, the p38 pathway can induce COX-2 expression in TMK-1 cells when appropriately stimulated (data not shown). However, our results suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways do not modulate basal or PMA-induced COX-2 expression in the TMK-1 gastric cancer cells.FIGURE 3Effect of signal transduction inhibitors on expression of COX-2 in TMK-1 cells. Cells were incubated with or without the inhibitors for 48 h, and PMA (10 ng/ml) was added for the last 20 h of incubation. Expression of COX-2 and β-actin (loading control) was analyzed by Western blotting. A, the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis, 2 μm) suppressed only the PMA-induced COX-2 expression, but not basal expression. B, JNK Inhibitor II (JNK-Inh, 50 μm) had no effect on COX-2 expression. C, inhibitors for MEK 1/2 (UO126, 10 μm) and p38 (SB203580, 10 μm) or a combination of these two inhibitors did not reduce basal or PMA-induced COX-2 expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To better define the PI3K/Akt pathway in TMK-1 cells, we investigated the phosphorylation status and activity of Akt at basal conditions in these cells. We observed constitutive phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308, and Ser-473 phosphorylation was inhibited by LY294002 (20 μm; Fig. 4A). We also measured the ability of immunoprecipitated Akt to phosphorylate an Akt substrate, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3α, and found that Akt activity was inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, we found that the expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue, an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, was almost undetectable in TMK-1 cells (Fig. 4C), which could explain the high basal levels of pAkt as shown in Fig. 4A. As the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway seems to play a pivotal role in COX-2 expression in gastric cancer cells, we next investigated downstream factors of this pathway (Fig. 5). The GSK-3β inhibitor SB415286 (20 μm) stimulated both basal and PMA-induced COX-2 protein expression in TMK-1 and MKN-28 cells (Fig. 6A). Rapamycin, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), did not alter basal or PMA-induced COX-2 protein expression in either cell line (30 nm; Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the induction of COX-2 protein expression by SB415286 was dose dependent (Fig. 7A), and two additional GSK-3β inhibitors, SB216763 (20 μm) and lithium chloride (30 mm), enhanced COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 7, B and C). In agreement with the protein expression data, basal mRNA levels of COX-2 increased following treatment with SB415286 by 1.9-fold in TMK-1 cells and by 4.4-fold in MKN-28 cells (Fig. 8, A and B). Similarly, SB415286 enhanced PMA-induced COX-2 mRNA expression in TMK-1 and MKN-28 cells by 2.2- and 2.8-fold, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8, C and D, basal and PMA-induced PGE2 production were also induced after incubation with SB415286 (by 3.3- and 1.5-fold in TMK-1 cells and by 2.9- and 1.9-fold in MKN-28 cells, respectively).FIGURE 6Effect of inhibition of GSK-3β and mTOR on COX-2 protein expression in TMK-1 and MKN-28 cells.

To address the aspect of GSK-3β-mediated signaling on COX-2 transcriptional regulation, we investigated the effect of SB415286 on expression of the COX-2 promoter reporter. Our results show that SB415286 led to a relatively modest (1.6 ± 0.14-fold) increase in COX-2 promoter activity, whereas PMA increased it by 4.5 ± 0.58-fold (Fig. 9A). The combination of SB415286 and PMA did not further induce the COX-2 promoter when compared with PMA alone (p = 0.26). The COX-2 3′-untranslated region contains elements related to the stability of the COX-2 transcript (22Ristimäki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

To determine whether GSK-3β induced COX-2 expression through a post-transcriptional mRNA stability mechanism, we investigated the effect of SB415286 on decay of the COX-2 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 9B, inhibition of GSK-3β led to stabilization of the COX-2 transcript, whereas PMA slightly accelerated the decay of the transcript. COX-2 expression, but not that of COX-1 or PGES enzymes, is responsible for PMA-induced PGE2 synthesis in TMK-1 gastric cancer cells. In addition, the great majority (90%) of basal COX enzyme activity was due to COX-2 in this cell type. Here we studied several putative signaling pathways that could lead to up-regulation of COX-2 expression. Our results indicate that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways that are frequently activated in colorectal cancer cells and that can induce COX-2 expression (25Shao J. Sheng H. Inoue H.

Furthermore, although PMA induction was blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor, it did not have any effect on the relatively high basal COX-2 expression in TMK-1 cells. In contrast, inhibition of GSK-3β played a central role in COX-2 expression in both diffuse-type (TMK-1) and intestinal-type (MKN-28) gastric cancer cells. This conclusion is supported by our data that show that three distinct inhibitors of GSK-3β induced COX-2 expression and that suppression of the PI3K activity led to an opposite effect. Contradictory data exist as to the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in regulation of COX-2 expression. Similar to our data, in Ras-transformed rat intestinal epithelial cells and in ultraviolet B radiation-treated human keratinocytes, inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway led to reduced expression of COX-2 (32Sheng H. Shao J. Dubois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2670-2675PubMed Google Scholar, 33Tang Q. Gonzales M. Inoue H. Bowden G.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4329-4332PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway enhanced COX-2 expression in tumor necrosis factor-α-treated colon cancer cells and in lipopolysaccharide-treated alveolar macrophages (34Weaver S.A.

These data indicate that there exist cell type and induction-dependent differences in regulation of COX-2 expression. Because the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 can also inhibit mTOR (36Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), another downstream target of Akt in addition to GSK-3β, we investigated whether these effects could be attributed to activation of mTOR. Because rapamycin, the inhibitor of mTOR, had no effect on COX-2 expression, we could conclude that mTOR is not involved. Consistent with our findings, inhibition of GSK-3β led to up-regulation of COX-2 in human keratinocytes and in renal medullary interstitial cells (33Tang Q. Gonzales M. Inoue H. Bowden G.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4329-4332PubMed Google Scholar, 37Rao R. Hao C.M. Breyer M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3949-3955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Rao R.

However, in certain conditions inhibition of GSK-3β can lead to inhibition of COX-2 expression, because fibroblasts that lack GSK-3β lose their responsiveness to tumor necrosis factor-α in respect to NF-κB-mediated COX-2 induction (39Takada Y. Fang X. Jamaluddin M.S. Boyd D.D. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39541-39554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GSK-3β inhibitors induced transcription of a COX-2 promoter (construct length –327/+59) in human keratinocytes and in colon cancer cells (construct length –1432/+59) (33Tang Q. Gonzales M. Inoue H. Bowden G.T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4329-4332PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wang Q. Zhou Y. Wang X. Evers B.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast to these previous studies, inhibition of GSK-3β in gastric cancer cells induced only a modest (1.6-fold) increase in COX-2 transcription (construct length –1840/+123), which cannot fully explain the increase found in COX-2 mRNA and protein levels. To this end, we performed mRNA stability studies. In TMK-1 gastric cancer cells the untreated COX-2 mRNA did not reach its half-life after 60 min of incubation with actinomycin D, which is in agreement with colon cancer cells or with serum-stimulated human lung fibroblasts, where the half-life of COX-2 ranged from 80 min to >2 h (23Dixon D.A.

Furthermore, our studies showed COX-2 mRNA to be stabilized by the GSK-3β inhibitor treatment. In fact, a 2-h incubation with SB415286 almost completely blocked degradation of the COX-2 transcript. To our knowledge this is the first time that modulation of GSK-3β activity has been linked to regulation of mRNA stability. In mammary cancer cells, serum withdrawal induces post-transcriptional stabilization of COX-2 mRNA involving the p38 pathway (24Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the PI3K/Akt pathway in concert with the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway acts similarly in rat intestinal epithelial cells (32Sheng H. Shao J. Dubois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2670-2675PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Wang et al. (40Wang Q. Zhou Y. Wang X. Evers B.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) described that inhibition of GSK-3β up-regulates COX-2 in a protein kinase C-δ- and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-dependent manner in colon cancer cell lines. Because none of the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors or the protein kinase C inhibitor had an effect on COX-2 expression, it is unlikely that any of these mechanisms is involved in maintenance of high basal COX-2 expression in TMK-1 gastric cancer cells. In contrast, PI3K activity seems to be a crucial component of this phenomenon, which is known to inhibit GSK-3β through Akt. As the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced the basal COX-2 mRNA expression levels only in the MKN-28 gastric cancer cell line, we cannot rule out that translational regulation might occur through PI3K pathway in TMK-1 cells at basal conditions. Importantly, our data show that the inhibition of GSK-3β stimulates COX-2 expression in gastric cancer cells, which is primarily due to increased mRNA stability and to a lesser extent enhanced transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2073513377,"RNA interference-mediated gene silencing has the potential to block gene expression. A synthetic double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) based on a sequence motif of 21 nucleotides from human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) E6E7 bicistronic RNA was found to be a potent siRNA that suppresses expression of both the E6 and E7 oncogenes in HPV16+ CaSki and SiHa cells. When stably expressed as a short hairpin RNA in these cells, however, siRNA silencing of E6 and E7 expression was efficient only at early cell passages, but became inefficient with increased cell passages despite the continued expression of the siRNA at the same level. The loss of the siRNA function was duplicable in stable p53 siRNA cells, but not in stable lamin A/C siRNA cells, suggesting that it is gene selective. The cells resistant to siRNA function retained normal siRNA processing, duplex unwinding and degradation of the unwound sense strand and RNA-induced silencing complex formation, suggesting that loss of the siRNA function occurred at a later step. Surprisingly, the siRNA-resistant cells were found to express notably a cytoplasmic protein of ∼50 kDa that specifically and characteristically interacted with the unwound, antisense strand E7 siRNA. Altogether, our data indicate that a potent siRNA targeting to an essential or regulatory gene might induce a cell to develop siRNA-suppressive function."
https://openalex.org/W1973502945,"OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1) is one of the main DNA glycosylases present in mammalian cells. The enzyme removes 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions, believed to be the most important oxidized lesions due to their relatively high incidence and their miscoding properties. This study shows that in prenatal mice brains the repair capacity for 8-oxoG is 5–10-fold higher than in adult mice brains. Western blot analysis and repair activity in extracts from Ogg1−/− mice revealed that OGG1 was responsible for the efficient 8-oxoG removal from prenatal mice. To investigate how OGG1 protects against oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis, pregnant Big Blue/wild-type and Big Blue/Ogg1−/− mice were exposed to nontoxic doses of gamma radiation. A 2.5-fold increase in the mutation frequency in Ogg1−/− mouse brains was obtained by exposure to 3.5 Gy at day 19 postfertilization. This was largely due to GC to TA transversions, believed to originate from 8-oxoG mispairing with A during replication. Furthermore, rapid cell divisions seemed to be required for fixation of mutations, as a similar dose of radiation did not increase the mutation frequency, or the frequency of GC to TA transversion, in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2027702041,"Acyl-CoA synthetases that activate fatty acids to their CoA derivatives play a central role in fatty acid metabolism. ACSBG1, an acyl-CoA synthetase originally identified in the fruit fly mutant bubblegum, was hypothesized to contribute to the biochemical pathology of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. We looked for homologous proteins and identified ACSBG2 in humans, mice, and rats. Human ACSBG1 and ACSBG2 amino acid sequences are 50% identical. ACSBG2 expression was confined to the testis and brainstem. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies further localized ACSBG2 expression to testicular Sertoli cells and large motoneurons in the medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord. Full-length cDNA encoding human and mouse ACSBG2 was cloned. In transfected COS-1 cells, both human and murine ACSBG2 were detected as 75- to 80-kDa proteins by Western blot. Cells overexpressing ACSBG2 had increased ability to activate oleic acid (C18:1ω9) and linoleic acid (C18:2ω6) but not other fatty acid substrates tested. Within a highly conserved motif known to be important for catalysis, human ACSBG2 contains a histidine residue where all other known acyl-CoA synthetases, including mouse and rat ACSBG2, contain an arginine. This substitution resulted in a shift of the human ACSBG2 pH optimum to a more acidic pH. Mutation of this histidine to arginine improved catalytic function at neutral pH by shifting the pH profile without affecting substrate specificity. Although the role of ACSBG2 in testicular and neuronal lipid metabolism remains unclear, the limited tissue expression pattern and limited substrate specificity rule out a likely role for this enzyme in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy pathology. Acyl-CoA synthetases that activate fatty acids to their CoA derivatives play a central role in fatty acid metabolism. ACSBG1, an acyl-CoA synthetase originally identified in the fruit fly mutant bubblegum, was hypothesized to contribute to the biochemical pathology of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. We looked for homologous proteins and identified ACSBG2 in humans, mice, and rats. Human ACSBG1 and ACSBG2 amino acid sequences are 50% identical. ACSBG2 expression was confined to the testis and brainstem. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies further localized ACSBG2 expression to testicular Sertoli cells and large motoneurons in the medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord. Full-length cDNA encoding human and mouse ACSBG2 was cloned. In transfected COS-1 cells, both human and murine ACSBG2 were detected as 75- to 80-kDa proteins by Western blot. Cells overexpressing ACSBG2 had increased ability to activate oleic acid (C18:1ω9) and linoleic acid (C18:2ω6) but not other fatty acid substrates tested. Within a highly conserved motif known to be important for catalysis, human ACSBG2 contains a histidine residue where all other known acyl-CoA synthetases, including mouse and rat ACSBG2, contain an arginine. This substitution resulted in a shift of the human ACSBG2 pH optimum to a more acidic pH. Mutation of this histidine to arginine improved catalytic function at neutral pH by shifting the pH profile without affecting substrate specificity. Although the role of ACSBG2 in testicular and neuronal lipid metabolism remains unclear, the limited tissue expression pattern and limited substrate specificity rule out a likely role for this enzyme in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy pathology.

Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 55-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The fatty acyl-CoA product can have several metabolic fates, including incorporation into phospholipids, mono-, di-, and triacylglycerols, sphingolipids, glycolipids, or cholesterol esters, acylation of proteins, and catabolism via β-oxidation. All ACSs are thought to utilize the same ATP-dependent reaction mechanism, in which the fatty acid is first adenylated with release of inorganic pyrophosphate. In the second step of the reaction, CoA-SH displaces AMP by forming a thioester linkage with the fatty acyl group (1Watkins P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 55-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, all ACSs are thought to contain a highly conserved amino acid sequence referred to at the AMP-binding domain (PROSITE PDOC00427, available at au.expasy.org/cgi-bin/nicedoc.pl?PDOC00427). We (2Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol.

Several properties of ACSBG1 suggest that it may be involved in the biochemical pathology of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). Patients with X-ALD (6Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. Powers J.

Science. 1999; 284: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), have neurodegeneration and elevated tissues levels of saturated very long-chain fatty acids. In mice, ACSBG1 is highly expressed in the brain (hippocampal and hypothalamic neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells), adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata), and testis (Leydig cells) (5Pei Z. Oey N.A.

These tissues are the primary sites of pathology in X-ALD (2Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35162-35169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Moriya-Sato A. Hida A. Inagawa-Ogashiwa M. Wada M.R. Sugiyama K. Shimizu J. Yabuki T. Seyama Y. Hashimoto N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When expressed in COS-1 cells, ACSBG1 has robust acyl-CoA synthetase activity and is capable of activating long- and very long-chain saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (2Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35162-35169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Pei Z. Oey N.A. Zuidervaart M.M. Jia Z.

However, a direct role for ACSBG1 in X-ALD pathology has not yet been demonstrated (8Fraisl P. Forss-Petter S. Zigman M. Berger J. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9Jia Z. Pei Z. Li Y. Wei L. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether ACS enzymes related to ACSBG1 existed, and if so, whether they were involved in X-ALD biochemical pathology. Examination of the ACSBG1 amino acid sequence revealed that it contained both the AMP-binding domain and the second conserved ACS sequence (motif 2) described above (2Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35162-35169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Sequence homology within motif 2 can be used to group related proteins into families 3P. A. Watkins, submitted for publication. (2Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35162-35169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the ACSBG1 motif 2 sequence differed sufficiently from motif 2 sequences of known short-, medium-, long-, and very long-chain ACSs, thus we concluded that ACSBG1 belonged to a distinct ACS family (2Steinberg S.J. Morgenthaler J. Heinzer A.K. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35162-35169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Homology probing of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein and nucleotide databases revealed that the ACS gene/protein family of humans, mice, and fruit flies to which ACSBG1 belongs each has only one other member. This “bubblegum-related” gene (ACSBG2) encodes a protein that is an ACS with a very restricted tissue and cellular expression pattern. Furthermore, the native human protein has a naturally occurring mutation at a highly conserved position that affects its enzymatic function. We describe here some of the properties of human and mouse ACSBG2. Materials and General Methods—[1-14C]Lauric acid (C12:0), [1-14C]palmitic acid (C16:0), [1-14C]arachidonic acid (C20:4), [1-14C]docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6), and [1-14C] lignoceric acid (C24:0) were obtained from Moravek, Inc. [1-14C]Oleic acid (C18:1) and [1-14C]linoleic acid (C18:2) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. [1-14C]Stearic acid was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Unlabeled fatty acids were from either Sigma or Cayman Chemical. Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (10Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. TM-4 Sertoli cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. General conditions for PCR were as previously reported (11Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Department of Biological Chemistry Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility using the fluorescent di-deoxy terminator method of cycle sequencing on an Applied Biosystems Inc. 377 automated DNA sequencer, following the protocols of the manufacturer. COS-1 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (11Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). TM4 cells were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test. Animals and Their Care—Wild-type 129SvEv mice were obtained from Taconic, Inc. (Germantown, NY). All mice used in these studies were approximately 3 months of age. Mice were housed in facilities of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine under controlled conditions, between 22 °C and 27 °C, on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with food and water ad libitum. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity with institutional guidelines that are in compliance with national and international laws and policies (EEC Council Directive 86/609, OJ L 358, 1 DEC.12,1987; NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, U.S. National Research Council, 1996). Cloning of Full-length ACSBG2 cDNA—Human testis total RNA (Ambion) was reverse-transcribed using the ThermoScript™ reverse transcription-PCR First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) to obtain testis cDNA. Full-length ACSBG2 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification using the forward oligonucleotide primer 5′-CGCGAATTCCTGCACACCTGGAATGAC-3′ (P15-1), which incorporates an EcoRI restriction site, reverse primer 5′-ATAGCGGCCGCCAGTCAGTGGTACATGTG-3′ (P15-6), which incorporates a NotI site, and testis cDNA as template. The 2016-bp PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The resulting construct, which included the entire open reading frame and 13 bp of 5′-untranslated DNA but no additional 3′ sequence following the stop codon, was fully sequenced. The insert sequence was identical to that of GenBank™ accession number NM_030924. Mouse ACSBG2 cDNA was cloned using a similar strategy. Total RNA was prepared from fresh mouse testis using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription and used as template for PCR with forward primer 5′-GAATTCAAAGGCTGGACCACCAATGACTC-3′, which incorporates an EcoRI site, and reverse primer 5′-CTCGAGGCTGATCTGTTGGAGGCATGAGGA-3′, which incorporates an XhoI site. The purified PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3. The insert was sequenced completely and contained a complete open reading frame, encoding 667 amino acids, plus 16 bp of 5′-untranslated DNA and 62 bp of 3′-untranslated DNA. The sequence of the amino-terminal portion (up to the codon for amino acid 243 of the open reading frame) was identical to that of GenBank™ accession number XM_619478, whereas the sequence of the C-terminal portion (encoding residue 244 through the 3′-untranslated region) was identical to that of XM_286829. The complete nucleotide sequence has been submitted to GenBank™ (accession number DQ250679). Polyclonal Antibody Production and Purification—A 951-bp fragment containing the C-terminal 315 amino acids of hACSBG2 was amplified by PCR using forward primer 5′-GGATCCGCAACATTGGCTTCAAGGTCAA-3′, incorporating a BamHI site, reverse primer P15-6, and full-length hACSBG2 in pcDNA3 as template. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and NotI and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX5X2 (Amersham Biosciences). After transduction of Escherichia coli BL21DE3 cells, synthesis of the glutathione S-transferase-hACSBG2 fusion protein was induced by incubation with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The fusion protein was solubilized from sonicated bacterial cells using 1% Triton X-100 and purified by chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunization of rabbits with purified fusion protein, boosting and bleeding was done commercially (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA). Crude antiserum was purified by either affinity binding or by adsorption. For affinity purification, preparative SDS-PAGE of the fusion protein on a 10% gel was used. After loading fusion protein in sample buffer and electrophoresis for 5 min, the power was turned off and a second aliquot of sample was loaded. This process was repeated such that a total of six aliquots were present, after which electrophoresis was allowed to proceed to completion. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and identified by Ponceau-S staining. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the nitrocellulose strip containing the six bands of fusion protein was incubated with a 5-fold dilution of crude serum (in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with PBS, bound antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and the eluate was immediately neutralized by addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The buffer was exchanged back to PBS using a Centricon 30 (Millipore), 1% bovine serum albumin was added, and purified antibody was stored at -80 °C. For adsorption of the crude antiserum, a nitrocellulose membrane was prepared by electrophoretic transfer of a mixture of mouse liver proteins and COS-1 cell proteins, separated by preparative SDS-PAGE. Because neither liver nor kidney (origin of COS-1 cells) express ACSBG2, dilute antiserum was incubated with this membrane to adsorb nonspecific antibodies. Adsorbed antiserum was stored at -80 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The overlap extension method was used to mutate histidine 511 of hACSBG2 to arginine (12Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). PCR was used to amplify two fragments of hACSBG2 that overlap and that each incorporate the desired mutation (underlined in the oligonucleotide primers); both reactions used full-length hACSBG2 in pcDNA3 as template. The first reaction amplified a 1547-bp fragment encoding amino acids 1-511 using forward primer P15-1 and reverse primer 5′-TGCGGCCGGTGACATAGAGGA-3′. The second reaction amplified a 482-bp fragment that encodes amino acids 508-666 using forward primer 5′-GTCACCGGCCGCATCAAAGAA-3 and reverse primer P15-6. The underlined CGC (R) codon replaced the wild-type CAC (H) codon. The two PCR products were gel-purified and used as template for additional PCR, with forward oligonucleotide primer P15-1 and reverse primer P15-6. The 2016-bp product was cloned into pcDNA3 as described above and completely re-sequenced. The sequence matched that of NM_030924 completely, except for the engineered A→G mutation. Northern Blot and mRNA Dot Blot Analyses—Total RNA was prepared from freshly harvested mouse tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty μg of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel at 4 V/cm for 2.5 h and then transferred overnight to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). A cDNA probe for detection of mAcsbg2 mRNA was prepared by PCR amplification of a 450-bp fragment using 5′-AGAGTCTCCAAGTCACGGTC-3′ and 5′-GGTGTAGATGCCAGTGACAAT-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and mouse testis cDNA as template. For control, a 528-bp glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was similarly prepared using 5′-ACCACCATGGAGAAGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-CTCAGTGTAGCCCAGGATGC-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Conditions for probe labeling, hybridization, and detection were as previously described (13Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. McGuinness M.C. Watkins P.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A human multiple tissue expression array containing 76 tissues was obtained from Clontech. A cDNA probe for detection of hACSBG2 mRNA was prepared by PCR amplification of a 1138-bp fragment using 5′-CACGATGGAGGAATTCATGG-3′ and 5′-CACTCTGACCAGACTGATA-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and hACSBG2 cDNA as template. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blotting—Mouse tissues were homogenized in 5 volumes of buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science) using a Pellet Pestle homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes). Subcellular fractions were prepared essentially following the method of de Duve et al. (14de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) as previously described (5Pei Z. Oey N.A. Zuidervaart M.M. Jia Z. Li Y. Steinberg S.J. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol.

For Western blots, cells were harvested by gentle trypsinization, washed with PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture, and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; after incubation with primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, immunoreactive proteins were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). Acyl-CoA Synthetase Assays—Radiochemical assays of ACS activity in frozen/thawed COS-1 cell suspensions using [1-14C]fatty acid substrates were performed essentially as described (16Watkins P.A. Ferrell Jr., E.V. Pedersen J.I. Hoefler G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Watkins P.A. Howard A.E. Mihalik S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells, 3 days post-transfection with either ACSBG2 constructs or the empty pcDNA3 vector, were harvested by gentle trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose containing 10 mm Tris (Cl-), pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Cell suspensions were subjected to at least one freeze/thaw cycle (-80 °C) prior to assay. In some cases, as noted in the text and figure legends, either KCl was added to the reaction mixture, or potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, replaced Tris (Cl-), pH 7.5. When the inhibitor Triacsin C was used, the assay was modified to permit preincubation of enzyme with the inhibitor prior to adding the radiolabeled substrate. Triacsin C (final concentration, 10 μm) in ethanol was added to reaction mixes containing all components except 14C-fatty acid. An equal volume of ethanol (final concentration, 1%) was added to control incubations. After 15 min at 37 °C, labeled substrate solubilized in α-cyclodextrin (16Watkins P.A. Ferrell Jr., E.V. Pedersen J.I. Hoefler G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was added and the reaction allowed to proceed for 20 min as usual. Fluorometric ACS assays were performed as previously described (5Pei Z. Oey N.A. Zuidervaart M.M. Jia Z. Li Y. Steinberg S.J. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol.

Indirect Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry—For indirect immunofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 1.0% Triton X-100 prior to incubation with primary and secondary antibodies as described previously (18Watkins P.A. Gould S.J. Smith M.A. Braiterman L.T. Wei H.-M. Kok F. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 292-301PubMed Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, testis, brainstem, and spinal cord from 3-month-old mice were harvested, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Tissue sections (5-8 μm thick) were cut using a cryostat and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde; blocking, incubation with primary and secondary antibody, peroxidase-based detection, counterstaining, and mounting were performed as described previously (5Pei Z.

To determine whether mammalian genomes contained related proteins, we queried NCBI nucleotide and protein databases using the BLAST algorithm with the human (h) ACSBG1 sequence as probe. We identified one predicted human protein consisting of 666 amino acid residues that shared 50% identity and 69% similarity with hACSBG1 (Fig. 1). Two highly conserved amino acid motifs (solid and broken underlines in Fig. 1) characteristic of ACSs were present in this open reading frame, hereafter referred to as hACSBG2. Within motif 2 (broken underline), the sequence that facilitates segregation of ACSs into families of related proteins, hACSBG1 and the predicted protein share 68% identity and 89% similarity. The next most homologous human proteins identified in the BLAST search had <30% identity with hACSBG1 and were members of the long-chain ACS family. The gene encoding hACSBG2 had previously been referred to as “bubblegum-related” with the interim gene symbol BGR. The BLAST search also detected putative mouse (m) and rat (r) homologs of hACSBG2, each of which contains 667 amino acids (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Alignment of human, mouse, and rat ACSBG2 amino acid sequences. The predicted amino acid sequences of hACSBG2, mACSBG2, and rACSBG2 were aligned using ClustalW. The AMP-binding domain (solid line) and conserved motif 2 (dashed line) are indicated.

Two proteins from the solute carrier SLC19A gene family have been identified as human thiamine transporters (hTHTRs), SLC19A1 (hTHTR1) and SLC19A2 (hTHTR2). Both of these transporters are co-expressed but are differentially targeted in polarized cell types that mediate vectorial thiamine transport (e.g. renal and intestinal epithelia). It is important to understand the domain structure of these proteins, namely which regions within the polypeptide sequence are important for physiological delivery to the cell surface, in order to understand the impact of clinically relevant mutations on thiamine transport. Here we have characterized the mechanisms regulating hTHTR2 distribution by using live cell imaging methods that resolve the targeting and trafficking dynamics of full-length hTHTR2, a series of hTHTR2 truncation mutants, as well as chimeras comprising the hTHTR1 and hTHTR2 sequence. We showed the following: (i) that the cytoplasmic COOH-tail of hTHTR2 is not essential for apical targeting in polarized cells; (ii) that delivery of hTHTR2 to the cell surface is critically dependent on the integrity of the transmembrane backbone of the polypeptide so that minimal truncations abrogate cell surface expression of hTHTR2; and (iii) video rate images of hTHTR2-containing intracellular vesicles displayed rapid bi-directional trafficking events to and from the cell surface impaired by microtubule-disrupting but not microfilament-disrupting agents as well as by overexpression of the dynactin subunit dynamitin (p50). Finally, we compared the behavior of hTHTR2 with that of hTHTR1 and the human reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1) to underscore commonalities in the cell surface targeting mechanisms of the entire SLC19A gene family.

The water-soluble micronutrient thiamine (vitamin B1) is essential for normal cellular functions, growth and development. In its coenzyme form (thiamine pyrophosphate), this vitamin plays an important role in cellular metabolism and energy production reactions (1Berdanier C.D. Advanced Nutrition Micronutrients. CRC Press, Inc., New York1998: 80-88Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, thiamine deficiency leads to a number of clinical abnormalities that encompass cardiovascular and neurological disorders (2Victor M. Adams R.D.C.G.H.

Because humans have lost their ability to synthesize thiamine de novo, they must rely on intestinal transport to meet their metabolic requirements. Furthermore, elimination of thiamine from the body is controlled via re-absorption of filtered thiamine in the renal glomeruli. Both of these systemic routes regulating thiamine uptake and elimination have been demonstrated to be carrier-mediated (9Said H.M. Ortiz A. Subramanian V.S. Neufield E.J. Moyer M.P. Dudeja P.K. Am.

These transporters, which share ∼48% identity at the amino acid level, are predicted to have 12 transmembrane (TM) domains with cytoplasmic NH2 and COOH termini and a large cytoplasmic loop between TM 6 and TM7 connecting the pseudo-symmetrical TM1-6 and TM7-12 domains (4Dutta B.

Both proteins are endogenously expressed within intestinal and renal epithelia and transport thiamine with similar substrate specificity and pH sensitivity (11Gastaldi G. Cova E. Verri A.

Acta. 2002; 1561: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The third member of this gene family (the gene product of the SLC19A1 gene) is the human reduced folate carrier (hRFC (15Matherly L.H. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 67: 131-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), which shares a similar topology with an overall ∼45% amino acid identity to the human thiamine transporters. Functionally, hRFC constitutes the major pathway for membrane transport of reduced folates as well as a route for uptake of certain antifolate chemotherapeutics, e.g. methotrexate. Therefore, the SLC19A gene family encodes micronutrient transporters of similar structural design but divergent substrate specificity. Because mutational dysfunction of the thiamine transporters, hTHTR1 and hTHTR2, has implicated in discrete clinical pathologies (3Zeng W.-Q. Al-Yamani E. Acierno Jr., J.S. Slaugenhaupt S. Gillis T.

Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is imperative to understand the structural and cell biological mechanisms supporting micronutrient transport, i.e. what features of their polypeptide structure support delivery to the cell surface, targeting to discrete plasma membrane domains as well as micronutrient translocation. To what extent are these features conserved between the different members of the SLC19A family? Here we have resolved factors controlling the delivery of hTHTR2 to the cell surface in polarized renal and intestinal epithelia, using live cell imaging methods to image the subcellular vesicular trafficking and membrane targeting of a series of hTHTR2 constructs, as well as hTHTR1 and hTHTR2 chimeras, fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). In contrast to many other nutrient transporters, the cytoplasmic COOH-tail of hTHTR2 is not essential for physiological targeting. Rather, we demonstrate that the cell surface expression of hTHTR2 is critically dependent on the integrity of the transmembrane backbone of the hTHTR2 polypeptide. Delivery to the cell surface was tracked by video rate imaging methods to resolve the rapid dynamics of intracellular hTHTR2-GFP-containing structures, the motion of which was dependent on intact microtubules but not microfilaments. Furthermore, measurements of steady-state targeting of hTHTR2 in the presence of microtubule-disrupting agents, or a cytoplasmic dynein inhibitor, disrupted the polarized expression of the full-length hTHTR2 polypeptide at the apical membrane domain. Comparison of these results with data obtained previously for hRFC and hTHTR1 (16Marchant J.S. Subramanian V.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33325-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol.

Chemicals and Reagents—Custom-made [3H]thiamine (specific activity 555 GBq/mmol) was obtained from ARC (St. Louis, MO). The enhanced green, yellow, and cyan fluorescent protein vectors (GFP-N3, YFP-N1, and CFP-N1) and the subcellular targeted fluorescent protein vectors (DsRed2-ER, mitochondria CFP, and Golgi CFP) were from BD Biosciences. G418 was from Invitrogen. Cytoskeletal disrupting agents were from Calbiochem. N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)hexatrienyl)-pyridinium dibromide (FM4-64) and LysoTracker Probes were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). MDCK (NBL-2), HuTu-80, and Caco-2 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). pCB6-HA-p50 was a generous gift from Prof. T. A. Schroer (The Johns Hopkins University). Plasmids for p75 and V1aR were described previously (18Boulware M.J. Subramanian V.S. Said H.M. Marchant J.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The derivation and specificity of hTHTR2 polyclonal antibodies were described previously (13Said H.M. Balamurugan K. Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Am. J.

Generation of hTHTR2-GFP and Truncated Constructs—Construction of the full-length cDNA for hTHTR2-GFP has been described previously (18Boulware M.J. Subramanian V.S. Said H.M. Marchant J.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Truncated constructs were generated by PCR using the primer combinations shown in Table 1 and in conditions described elsewhere (16Marchant J.S. Subramanian V.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33325-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. Said H.M. Am. J.

The PCR products and the GFP-N3 and YFP-N1 vectors were digested with the restriction enzymes XhoI and BamHI or XhoI and SacII, and the products were gel-separated and then ligated together to generate in-frame fusion proteins with the fluorescent protein (GFP or YFP) fused to the COOH terminus of each hTHTR-2 construct. To generate hTHTR1 and hTHTR2 chimeras, in which TM12 and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tails of hTHTR1 and hTHTR2 were interchanged (Fig. 2A), a SalI site was introduced at 1326 and 1276 positions of hTHTR1 and hTHTR2, respectively. Chimeras were generated by PCR using the primer combinations shown in Table 1 and the conditions described above. The PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes XhoI and SalI or SalI and BamHI, and the products were gel-separated and then ligated to generate chimera. PCR was performed on ligated chimeric products using a combination of forward (XhoI) hTHTR1 and reverse (BamHI) hTHTR2 or vice versa primers to confirm ligation. The PCR products and GFP-N3 were digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated together to generate in-frame mutant fusion proteins. The resulting nucleotide sequence of each construct was verified by sequencing (Laragen, CA).TABLE 1Combination of primers used to prepare the truncated constructs by PCRConstructForward and reverse primers (5′-3′)PositionsFragmentbpbphTHTR2-GFPCCGCTCGAGATGGATTGTTACAGAACTTCACTAAG;1-14881488CGGGATCCGAGTTTTGTTGACATGATGATATTAChTHTR2-YFPCCGCTCGAGATGGATTGTTACAGAACTTCACTAAG;1-14881488TCCCCGCGGGAGTTTTGTTGACATGATGATATTAChTHTR2-(1-464)-GFPCCGCTCGAGATGGATTGTTACAGAACTTCACTAAG;1-13921392CGGGATCCGGTTGAGTAGGTAATATACATGCTTCThTHTR2-(1-455)-GFPCCGCTCGAGATGGATTGTTACAGAACTTCACTAAG;1-13651365CGGGATCCCATTAGGAAAATTCCAGCAAThTHTR2-(1-446)-GFPCCGCTCGAGATGGATTGTTACAGAACTTCACTAAG;1-13381338CGGGATCCAAAATAGCTCCCATAAAACTAAAAACTGhTHTR2-(1-436)-GFPCCGCTCGAGATGGATTGTTACAGAACTTCACTAAG;1-13081308CGGGATCCGCTGACTGGCAAGTTGAGCChTHTR2-(1-423)-GFPCCGCTCGAGATGGATTGTTACAGAACTTCACTAAG;1-12691269CGGGATCCCACAGTCATGATGGTCTGAATChTHTR2-(1-396)-GFPCCGCTCGAGATGGATTGTTACAGAACTTCACTAAG;1-11881188CGGGATCCAACTGCAATCTGAAATACTGCTAhTHTR2-(1-190)-GFPCCGCTCGAGATGGATTGTTACAGAACTTCACTAAG;1-570570CGGGATCCTAGGAAAAGTGAGAAAAGGAAAGChTHTR2-(456-496)-GFPCCGCTCGAGATGAGAAGCATGTATATTACCTACTCAACC;1366-1488122CGGGATCCGAGTTTTGTTGACATGATGATATTACChimerasForward and reverse primers (5′-3′)PositionsFragmentbpbphTHTR2-(1-425)CCGCTCGAGATGGATTGTTACAGAACTTCACTAAG;1-12751275GCGTCGACTACAATCACAGTCATGATGhTHTR2-(426-496)GCGTCGACCAGAGAGGGCTCAACT;1276-1491215CGGGATCCGAGTTTTGTTGACATGATGATATTAChTHTR1-(1-442)CCGCTCGAGATG GATGTGCCCGGCC;1-13251325GCGTCGACCACAATTAGAGTGAGCAGhTHTR1-(443-497)GCGTCGACGCCAGTGGCCTTCCATTA;1326-1491165CGGGATCCTGAAGTGGTTACTTGAGAACT Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Human duodenally derived intestinal epithelial cells (HuTu-80) and MDCK were maintained in minimal essential medium. Human adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. All media were supplemented with 10-20% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (0.29 g/liter), sodium bicarbonate (2.2 g/liter), penicillin (100,000 units/liter), and streptomycin (10 mg/liter). For transient transfection, cells were grown on sterile glass-bottomed Petri dishes (MatTek, MA) and transfected at 95% confluency with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For transient transfection on filters, MDCK or Caco-2 cells were seeded onto collagen-coated filters (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and grown until confluency. Individual filter dishes were transfected ∼5 days post-confluency in Opti-MEM medium containing 2 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000. Transfected cells were visualized using confocal microscopy after 24-48 h. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—HuTu-80 cells expressing hTHTR2-GFP, hTHTR2-YFP, GFP, and YFP were generated by G418 selection (0.8 mg/ml). To determine the level of hTHTR2 expression in the stable cell lines, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR (17Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Functionality of hTHTR2 was determined by [3H]thiamine uptake assay. Briefly, cell monolayers were incubated for7 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with [3H]thiamine (30 nm). Uptake was terminated by addition of ice-cold Krebs-Ringer buffer, and accumulated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Depolymerization of Microtubules—MDCK cells were treated with nocodazole using minor modifications of the method described by Kreitzer et al. (20Kreitzer G. Schmoranzer J. Low S.H. Li X. Gan Y. Weimbs T. Simon S.M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in serum-free medium on ice for 30 min to depolymerize the cold-labile, nocodazole-resistant microtubules. Cells were then treated with 20 μm nocodazole (30 min, on ice) and thereafter transfected at room temperature with hTHTR2-GFP cDNA. The monolayer was then maintained in 10 μm nocodazole (37 °C, overnight) until imaging 18-24 h later. Immunofluorescence—Nocodazole-treated MDCK cells (monolayers transfected with hTHTR2-GFP as well as naive controls) were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Washington, PA). Cells were permeabilized with 2% Triton X-100 and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (30 min at room temperature). Cells were then incubated with hTHTR2 antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with blocking solution (2 h, room temperature) and finally incubated with anti-rabbit TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking solution (1 h). For visualization of immunofluorescence, cells were mounted using fluoromount reagent (Southern Biotechnology Associate Inc., Birmingham, AL) and imaged using confocal microscopy. Live Cell Confocal Microscopy—Cells were imaged using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scanner attached to an Olympus Provis AX70 upright microscope that was equipped with a ×60 water immersion objective for imaging filter-grown MDCK or Caco-2 cells. Fluorophores were excited using the 488-nm line from an argon ion laser, and emitted fluorescence was monitored with a 530 ± 20 nm band pass or a 620 nm long pass filter. For video rate confocal images of vesicular trafficking, hTHTR2-GFP fluorescence was monitored using a homemade confocal microscope (21Callamaras N. Parker I. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Images were captured at 30 Hz (1 frame every 33 ms) and digitized using the VideoSavant processing package (IO Industries, London, Ontario, Canada). For processing the motion of individual vesicles, the frame to frame tracking function in Metamorph was employed (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, using a high numerical aperture lens (NA = 1.45, ×60), was used to image near-membrane trafficking events. Fluorescence emission was resolved using a EM-CCD (Hamamatsu, C9100-02). QuickTime videos of trafficking events are provided as supplemental movies 1-6. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur benchtop cytometer (BD Biosciences). To obtain sufficient numbers of positively transfected cells for these experiments, MDCK cells were grown in T25 tissue culture flasks and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 in serum-free media (Opti-MEM). Monolayers were trypsinized 48 h post-transfection, and cells were pelleted, resuspended, and filtered (35 μm filter) in 2-ml aliquots of Ca2+-free media at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml as described previously (16Marchant J.S. Subramanian V.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33325-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In all flow cytometry experiments, samples of untransfected and GFP-transfected cells were run in parallel with experimental samples to calibrate suitable parameters for identifying the intact, transfected cell population. hTHTR2 Targets to the Apical Cell Surface in Renal and Intestinal Epithelia—To visualize the targeting of hTHTR2 in both renal and intestinal epithelia, the cDNA of the full-length hTHTR2 protein was fused to GFP (hTHTR2-GFP) and transiently transfected into MDCK and Caco-2 cells, so that the resulting fluorescence distribution could be imaged using confocal microscopy. In confluent monolayers of both cell lines grown either on filter or cover glass, hTHTR2-GFP was localized at the apical cell surface (Fig. 1, A and B), as well as within a variety of intracellular structures distal to the apical surface (discussed below). Axial sections (xz) demonstrated that the plasma membrane expression of hTHTR2 was confined to the apical membrane domain, a distribution that contrasted with that of cells transfected with GFP alone, where fluorescence distribution was evident throughout the entire cytoplasmic volume (Fig. 1, A and B). Measurements of fluorescence intensity from axial sections of hTHTR2-expressing cells grown on filter supports showed almost exclusive bias toward expression at the apical cell surface (91.1 ± 3.6% apical in MDCK cells and 84.6 ± 6.2% apical in Caco-2 cells; see Fig. 1C). Appropriate polarization of monolayers was confirmed using constructs of known targeting polarity (p75, apical; V1aR, basolateral in MDCK cells; see Fig. 1C). Finally, functional assays of [3H]thiamine accumulation using filter-grown MDCK cells revealed that apical accumulation of [3H]thiamine was ∼3-fold greater (2.8 ± 0.7-fold, n = 3) in cells overexpressing hTHTR2-GFP relative to nontransfected controls, consistent with previous results (18Boulware M.J. Subramanian V.S. Said H.M. Marchant J.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The Cytoplasmic COOH-terminal Tail of hTHTR2 Is Not Required for Apical Cell Surface Targeting—To delimit the region(s) within the hTHTR2 polypeptide important for targeting to the cell surface in polarized cells, we designed a series of eight hTHTR2 truncation constructs (Table 1). First, we examined the effect of truncation of the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal tail of hTHTR2, because the polarized targeting of many cell surface transporters is impacted by targeting motifs/sequences within the region. Truncation of the COOH-terminal tail of hTHTR2 (amino acids 456-496), either partially (hTHTR2-(464)-GFP) or completely (hTHTR2-(455)-GFP), did not disrupt the overall polarity of expression of hTHTR2 in either MDCK or Caco-2 cells, imaged 24-48 h after transient transfection. Both of these truncation constructs expressed with predominant apical polarization (e.g. axial fluorescence ratios resolved 84.0 ± 6.2 and 77.2 ± 7.5% apical targeting for hTHTR2-(464)-GFP and hTHTR2-(455)-GFP, respectively, in MDCK cells; see Fig. 2, A and B). The apical-basal bias of each truncation construct was certainly less pronounced than wild type (Fig. 2A), but for both mutants the majority of expressed protein was targeted apically (by at least a 3:1 ratio). Next, we engineered two reciprocal chimeras between hTHTR1 (basolateral bias (18Boulware M.J. Subramanian V.S. Said H.M. Marchant J.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) and hTHTR2 (apical bias; see Fig. 1), in which the entire COOH-terminal tail and the terminal transmembrane spanning domain were swapped (Fig. 2A). Despite replacement of the entire cytoplasmic COOH-terminal region, each chimera targeted with similar polarity to the parent protein (Fig. 2, A and B), i.e. the hTHTR2:hTHTR1 chimera targeted apically, and the hTHTR1:hTHTR2 targeted more basolaterally. Therefore, we conclude that the polypeptide sequence of the cytoplasmic tail is not essential for cell surface targeting (truncation mutants) nor does it contain determinants that direct the polarized targeting of the full-length polypeptide. Although the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal region is nonessential for targeting to the cell surface, its presence does influence the amount of hTHTR2 protein expressed as inferred from the fluorescence intensity of transfected cells. For example, although the hTHTR2-(455)-GFP construct was predominantly targeted to the apical cell surface, cells expressing this construct were noticeably dimmer (at equivalent laser power) than wild type hTHTR2-GFP-expressing cells. Given identical cDNA transfection protocols and promoter expression, this difference likely reflects differences in cellular processing of the truncated protein (e.g. relative rates of synthesis or degradation). To better quantify these differences at the population (cf. single cell) level, we performed flow cytometric analyses using transiently transfected MDCK populations. Measurements of the mean fluorescent intensity of positively transfected MDCK cells revealed that although partial or complete truncation of the COOH-terminal tail did not influence apical targeting polarity, loss of this cytoplasmic COOH-terminal sequence decreased the steady-state level of construct expression. The mean fluorescence of cell populations expressing hTHTR2-(464)-GFP and hTHTR2-(455)-GFP was only ∼75 and ∼25% as intense as MDCK cell populations expressing full-length hTHTR2-GFP (Fig. 2C). Comparison of these results with truncation mutants of the other members of the SLC19A gene family (hRFC and hTHTR1), revealed a similar effect, i.e. truncations into the cytoplasmic tail of hRFC and hTHTR1 decreased the protein expression (Fig. 2C) but not the targeting of the protein to the plasma membrane (16Marchant J.S.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the COOH-terminal tail does not dictate targeting, it appears to play an important role in the efficiency of expression of all the members of the SLC19A gene family. Plasma Membrane Expression of hTHTR2 Is Dependent on the Integrity of the Polypeptide Backbone—In contrast to deletion/replacement of the COOH-terminal tail, further truncation into the transmembrane backbone of hTHTR2 resulted in a complete loss of cell surface targeting. Truncation after TM6 (hTHTR2-(190)-GFP), i.e. in the cytoplasmic linker between the TM1-6 and TM7-12 domains, resulted in retention of the mutant construct within the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3A) as well a dramatic decrease in amount of protein expressed as judged by fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3B). Similarly, shorter deletions comprising either the last two TM domains (hTHTR2-(396)-GFP) or the last TM domain (i.e. hTHTR2-(423)-GFP and hTHTR2-(436)-GFP) also abrogated cell surf"

Unlike their precursor cells, blood monocytes, alveolar macrophages are long-lived and tend to be resistant to apoptotic stimuli. In this study, we examined the role of differentiation in altering baseline phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt activity. We found that differentiation increased activity of pro-survival PI 3-kinase/Akt while decreasing amounts of the negative PI 3-kinase regulator, PTEN. PTEN is a lipid phosphatase with activity against phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI3,4,5P3), the major bioactive product of PI 3-kinase. Examining in vivo differentiation of alveolar macrophages (by comparing blood monocytes to alveolar macrophages from single donors), we found that differentiation resulted in increased baseline reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the alveolar macrophages. This led to a deficiency in PTEN, increased activity of Akt, and prolonged survival of alveolar macrophages. These data support the hypothesis that alterations in ROS levels contribute to macrophage homeostasis by altering the balance between PI 3-kinase/Akt and the phosphatase, PTEN.

Alveolar macrophages are critical effector cells in immunity and inflammation in the lung. They are derived from peripheral blood monocytes that migrate to the lung and differentiate into alveolar macrophages. Unlike their precursor cells, blood monocytes, which undergo rapid apoptosis, alveolar macrophages are long-lived and tend to be resistant to apoptotic stimuli (1Cline M.J. Lehrer R.I. Territo M.C. Golde D.W. Ann. Intern. Med. 1978; 88: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).

PI 3-kinase phosphorylates membrane phospholipids, generating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI3,4,5P3). PH domain proteins, including Akt, are recruited to PI3,4,5P3 in the plasma membrane, leading to their activation. Akt modulates cell survival by both up-regulating pro-survival pathways and down-regulating pro-apoptotic pathways (2Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 3Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar). Akt activity is negatively regulated by the lipid phosphatase, PTEN. PTEN dephosphorylates PI3,4,5P3, reducing the pool of phosphoinositides required for Akt activity (4Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). PTEN was originally described as a tumor suppressor protein and is deleted or mutated in a number of malignancies; however, it has become clear in numerous studies that PTEN also serves an important role in the regulation of normal cellular functions, including development, immunity, and cell growth (for review, see Ref. 5Yamada K.M. Araki M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2375-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of PTEN has been shown to occur at several levels. Phosphorylation of PTEN results in a conformational change in the protein and masking of the membrane binding surface, thus preventing interaction of PTEN with its membrane-localized substrate, PI3,4,5P3 (6Das S. Dixon J.E. Cho W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7491-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 7Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell.

Oxidant-mediated negative regulation of PTEN function has also been shown to occur (9Lee S.R. Yang K.S. Kwon J. Lee C. Jeong W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20336-20342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), resulting in reversible inactivation of PTEN phosphatase activity. PTEN has also been shown to be regulated transcriptionally (10Patel L. Pass I. Coxon P. Downes C.P. Smith S.A. Macphee C.H. Curr.

Our studies demonstrate that alveolar macrophages are deficient in PTEN and that this is linked to constitutive activation of Akt. Differentiation-induced increases in baseline ROS contribute to the decreased PTEN protein and increased Akt observed in alveolar macrophages. Reagents—Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 was obtained from Calbiochem. Protease inhibitors were obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Antibodies were from various sources: anti-PTEN antibodies were from Cascade Biosciences (Winchester, MA), antibodies to phosphorylated Akt (serine 473) and cleaved caspase 7 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), the antibody to β-actin was from Sigma-Aldrich, and antibodies to total Akt were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies for Western analysis (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse Ig) were also from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Isolation of Human Alveolar Macrophages—Alveolar macrophages were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage as previously described (15Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18075-18080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, normal volunteers with a lifetime non-smoking history, no acute or chronic illness, and no current medications, with the exception of oral contraceptives, underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. The lavage procedure used five 20-ml aliquots of sterile, warmed saline in each of three segments of the lung. The lavage fluid was filtered through two layers of gauze and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed twice in saline and suspended in complete medium, Rosewell Park Memorial Institute tissue culture medium (Invitrogen) with gentamicin. Differential cell counts were determined using a Wright-Giemsa-stained cytocentrifuge preparation. All cell preparations had between 90 and 100% alveolar macrophages. All protocols were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. Isolation of Human Blood Monocytes—A volume of 180 ml of heparinized whole blood was obtained by venipuncture of the same volunteers that underwent bronchoscopy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated over a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (Sigma-Aldrich), and monocytes were isolated by negative selection using magnetic labeling and separation techniques (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). Monocyte purity was evaluated using Wright-Giemsa staining and was >98%. Monocytes were differentiated in 10% human AB serum for 8-10 days at which time cells were harvested for either total protein or RNA. Cell Survival Assay—Freshly isolated alveolar macrophages were plated in serum-free media plus gentamicin alone or with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (50 μm) for 24 h. Samples were analyzed for cell death using two different methods: trypan blue exclusion and ethidium homodimer nuclear staining (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The percentage of dead cells was calculated by counting at least 300 cells per field in a blinded fashion. Triplicate cultures were performed on each of two separate experiments. These cells were assessed for apoptosis using Western analysis and an antibody directed against cleaved caspase 7. In some experiments, cell viability was also assessed using a commercially available kit to quantitate ATP amounts (CellTiter-Glo®, Promega, Madison, WI). ATP amounts have been shown to correlate with metabolically active (viable) cells (16Crouch S.P. Kozlowski R. Slater K.J. Fletcher J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 160: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Adenovirus Vectors—First generation recombinant adenovirus was generated by the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core (17Anderson R.D. Haskell R.E. Xia H. Roessler B.J. Davidson B.L. Gene. Ther. 2000; 7: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The particle titers of the adenoviral stocks were typically 1012 DNA particles/ml; functional titers were ∼4 × 1010 particle forming units/ml. Adenovirus vectors expressing the transgene for green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, PTEN (AdPTEN, kindly provided by Dr. J. Engelhardt at our institution), or an empty vector containing no transgene (AdVector), were used to infect the cells at a multiplicity of infection of 500. These vectors were free of wild-type virus contamination as determined by plaque assay and PCR. Freshly isolated human alveolar macrophages were plated, and virus was added in serum-free media. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and harvested for total cellular protein. In parallel studies, cell survival was determined using either ethidium homodimer staining or the ATP viability assay (see “Cell Survival Assay” above). Efficiency of infection was determined in each experiment by examining green fluorescence of the AdGFP-infected cells using a Leica DMIRB inverted fluorescence microscope (Wetzlar, Germany). Similar infection efficiencies were assumed with the AdVector and AdPTEN viruses. Western Analysis—Western analysis for the presence of specific proteins was performed on freshly isolated alveolar macrophages or blood monocytes using total cellular protein. The protein concentrations of the lysates were measured by the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg of nuclear extracts and 30 μg of total cellular protein) were mixed 1:1 with 2× sample buffer (20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 1.25 m Tris, pH 6.8; all chemicals were from Sigma), loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and run at 100 volts for 2 h. Cell proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL), blocked with 5% milk in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed with a chemiluminescent substrate, ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Following development of the primary antibodies, bound immunoglobulins were removed from the membranes by washing 2 times for 15 min each at room temperature in Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce), and the membranes were re-probed for β-actin. An autoradiograph was obtained, and protein levels were quantitated using a FluorS scanner and Quantity One software for analysis (Bio-Rad). The data were analyzed, and statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). Real-time RT-PCR Detection of PTEN mRNA—Total RNA was prepared from freshly isolated human alveolar macrophages or blood monocytes using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test B, Friendwood, TX). One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a RETRO-script RT-PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and was quantitated using the RiboGreen kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR as follows. In a 0.2-ml PCR tube (Bio-Rad), 2 μlof cDNA was added to 48 μl of PCR mixture containing 160 μm of each dNTP (Invitrogen), 3.0 mm MgCl2 (Invitrogen), 1:15,000 SYBR Green I DNA dye (Molecular Probes), 0.2 μm of each sense and antisense primer (IDT, Coralville, IA), and 2.5 units of Platinum TaqDNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplification was then performed in an iCycler iQ fluorescence thermocycler (Bio-Rad). Fluorescence data were captured during the 10-s dwell to ensure that primer dimers were not contributing to the fluorescence signal generated with SYBR Green I DNA dye. Specificity of the amplification was confirmed using melting curve analysis. Data were collected and recorded by iCycler iQ software (Bio-Rad) and expressed as a function of threshold cycle (Ct), the cycle at which the fluorescence intensity in a given reaction tube rises above background (calculated as 10× mean ± S.D. of fluorescence in all wells over the baseline cycles). Specific primer sets used for human PTEN and HPRT genes are as follows (5′ to 3′): PTEN (sense, TAA AGG CAC AAG AGG CCC TA; antisense, AGG TAA CGG CTG AGG GAA CT); HPRT (sense, CCT CAT GGA CTG ATT ATG GAC; antisense, CAG ATT CAA CTT GCG CTCATC). Primers were selected based on nucleotide sequences downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information data bank and designed with software by S. Rozen and H. J. Skaletsky. 3S. Rozen and H. J. Skaletsky (2000) Primer3, source code available at fokker.wi.mit.edu/primer3/. Quantitation of PTEN mRNA—Relative quantitative gene expression was calculated as follows: for each sample assayed, the Ct values for reactions amplifying PTEN and HPRT were determined. Abundance of PTEN mRNA, relative to abundance of HPRT mRNA, in each cell type was calculated by the formula 2-ΔΔCt. The validity of this approach was confirmed by using serial 10-fold dilutions of template of template containing PTEN and HPRT genes. Using the 10-fold dilutions, the amplification efficiencies for PTEN and HPRT amplimers were found to be identical. Electron Spin Resonance—Freshly isolated blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages were placed in chelated phosphate-buffered saline after culture in serum-free media or in media plus 15 mm N-acetyl cysteine. The spin trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was added to the samples at a final concentration of 50 mm. ESR spectra for HO· were recorded using a Bruker EMX ESR spectrometer with the following settings: receiver gain, 1 × 106; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; modulation frequency, 100.0 kHz; sweep width, 80.0 G; microwave power, 39.8 milliwatt; and frequency of 9.854 GHz. Spectra were the result of eight signal-averaged scans collected over 15 min. The analyses of the ESR spectra were based on the hyperfine splitting values characteristic of the spin adduct (18Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, 19Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. Le Moigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed on the densitometry data, the survival assays, and real-time PCR data. Significance was determined by the Students t test. Alveolar Macrophages Have High Constitutive Akt Activation and Are PTEN-deficient as Compared with Blood Monocytes—Previous studies in our laboratory showed that resting alveolar macrophages have constitutive activation of Akt (20Monick M.M. Robeff P.K. Butler N.S. Flaherty D.M. Carter A.B. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32992-33000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) which is thought to play an important role in survival of these cells (21Liu H. Perlman H. Pagliari L.J. Pope R.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Given that alveolar macrophages have a much longer in vivo survival time than their precursor cells, blood monocytes (22Thomas E.D. Ramberg R.E. Sale G.E. Sparkes R.S. Golde D.W. Science. 1976; 192: 1016-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that monocytes would have less Akt activation. Also, because PTEN is a negative regulator of the PI 3-kinase pathway, we further speculated that alveolar macrophages would have low amounts of PTEN. We obtained matching sets of freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages from a series of normal human volunteers, isolated total cellular protein, and performed Western analysis using antibodies directed against active Akt (phosphorylated on serine 473) and total PTEN. As shown in Fig. 1, human alveolar macrophages have higher constitutive Akt activity compared with blood monocytes with a reciprocal decrease in PTEN. Conversely, blood monocytes have very little constitutive Akt activation and high amounts of PTEN. PI 3-Kinase Activation Is Important for Survival in Alveolar Macrophages—To lend physiologic relevance to our observations, we examined in vitro survival of human alveolar macrophages in culture in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. In these experiments, macrophages were cultured under serum-free conditions with and without inhibitor, and cell death was measured using trypan blue exclusion and ethidium homodimer staining after 24 h. Fig. 2 shows these results and illustrates the importance of PI 3-kinase activation and downstream phosphorylated Akt expression on survival of these cells. We also examined survival by harvesting cells for total protein and performing a Western analysis for cleaved caspase 7 expression. Caspase 7 is a major contributor in the execution of apoptosis. It is a major effector caspase that cleaves intracellular substrates and serves as a marker for apoptosis (23Fraser A. Evan G. Cell. 1996; 85: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 24Chandler J.M. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26357-26364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the Western blot shown as an insert to the survival graph (Fig. 2), we demonstrate that inhibiting PI 3-kinase activity induces significant caspase 7 cleavage, consistent with the increase in cell death demonstrated by trypan blue exclusion and ethidium homodimer assays. We also show that blood monocytes, which express very low levels of active Akt, are hypersusceptible to cell death and apoptosis via inhibition of PI 3-kinase. This also supports the idea that Akt activation is critical for cell survival. Overexpression of PTEN Alters Akt Activation and Alveolar Macrophage Survival—To evaluate the effect of PTEN expression on alveolar macrophage survival, we infected alveolar macrophages with an adenovirus vector containing the PTEN transgene. These data are shown in Fig. 2B. The upper left panel shows that alveolar macrophages can be infected with 75% efficiency using an adenovirus vector containing GFP. The upper right panel is a Western analysis of PTEN and phospho Akt showing that PTEN is overexpressed in cells infected with the PTEN vector but is unaffected by the empty vector. Importantly, overexpression of PTEN results in loss of Akt activation (phospho Akt) and enhanced cell death, shown by ethidium homodimer staining (middle panel) and by ATP viability assay (Fig. 2C). Endogenous Oxidant Production by Alveolar Macrophages Affects PTEN Expression—In these experiments, we demonstrate that differentiation of blood monocytes to alveolar macrophages leads to an increase in baseline oxidant tone. Using ESR and the spin trap DMPO to trap hydroxyl radicals, we found that alveolar macrophages, compared with blood monocytes, spontaneously produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species in the unstimulated state, whereas blood monocytes produce little or none. This is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that alveolar macrophages contain increased superoxide compared with blood monocytes (26Carter A.B. Tephly L.A. Venkataraman S. Oberley L.W. Zhang Y. Buettner G.R. Spitz D.R. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Observations in the literature led us to ask if the alterations in oxidant tone are linked to the changes in PTEN protein amounts. Vasudevan and colleagues have shown that PTEN transcription can be down regulated indirectly by NFκB p65 via sequestration of the transcriptional co-activator proteins, CBP/p300 (13Vasudevan K.M. Gurumurthy S. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1007-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and we have observed that alveolar macrophages have high constitutive expression of NFκB p65 (data not shown). Furthermore, it is known that NFκB activation is oxidant-mediated (27Kaul N. Forman H.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar) and that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can inhibit this activation (29Kim C.H. Kim J.H. Lee J. Hsu C.Y. Ahn Y.S. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Pajonk F. Riess K. Sommer A. McBride W.H. Free Radic. Biol.

Wang M. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50455-50464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Given these observations, we hypothesized that the loss of PTEN might be modulated by oxidant tone in macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we used the antioxidant, NAC or the addition of exogenous glutathione, to inhibit endogenous oxidant production of alveolar macrophages and examined the effect on PTEN in macrophages. These results are shown in Fig. 3. Using ESR, we determined generation of HO· in blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages at baseline and after treatment with NAC. Fig. 3A shows that alveolar macrophages, unlike monocytes, generate large amounts of HO· under control conditions and that this is inhibited by NAC. To examine the effect of the high oxidant levels on PTEN expression, we evaluated whole cell lysates for PTEN after treatment with NAC (3 h) or NAC and glutathione (24 h). Fig. 3B shows that PTEN expression is increased in alveolar macrophages after treatment with NAC or glutathione, suggesting that endogenous oxidant production by alveolar macrophages is important in down-regulation of PTEN. When we performed a similar experiment in blood monocytes (which exhibit no spontaneous oxidant production), we found no changes in PTEN protein amounts after treatment with NAC (Fig. 3C). PTEN Is Down-regulated during in Vitro Monocyte Differentiation—Given that human alveolar macrophages are derived from blood monocytes via a lung-specific differentiation process and that these cells have very different expression levels of PTEN and Akt activity, we asked if PTEN amounts were consistently altered during in vitro differentiation. Peripheral blood monocytes obtained from normal human volunteers were differentiated in culture with human serum for 7-10 days, and RNA or total protein was isolated from the cells. Fig. 4 demonstrates that monocyte-derived macrophages have decreased PTEN mRNA compared with the housekeeping gene, HPRT, after the differentiation process. This is similar to the differences noted in baseline PTEN mRNA seen when comparing blood monocytes to human alveolar macrophages (Fig. 4A). It is important to note that levels of HPRT mRNA between monocytes and alveolar macrophages are comparable. Examining protein levels of PTEN during the in vitro differentiation process, we found a consistent decrease over time of relative amounts of PTEN (Fig. 4B). When we examined Akt activation during in vitro differentiation, we found that active Akt increased (Fig. 4C). Consistent with our primary cell data, we found that monocyte differentiation leads to an increase in ROS production (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that the differences in PTEN levels and Akt activity between blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages are the result of a differentiation process that can be replicated in vitro. We also examined the effect of inhibition of oxidant production on survival of monocytes differentiated in vitro. Fig. 4E demonstrates that monocytes differentiated in the presence of NAC have diminished survival and fail to differentiate into macrophage-like cells. This suggests that spontaneous production of oxidants during the process of differentiation is important for acquiring the alveolar Macrophage survival phenotype. One of the most intriguing characteristics of alveolar macrophages is their ability to survive for prolonged periods of time in vivo. In fact, the estimated turnover time of alveolar macrophages in humans is 81 days (22Thomas E.D. Ramberg R.E. Sale G.E. Sparkes R.S. Golde D.W. Science. 1976; 192: 1016-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to their precursor cells, blood monocytes, which have a much shorter life span and undergo apoptosis within 1-2 days (1Cline M.J. Lehrer R.I. Territo M.C. Golde D.W. Ann. Intern. Med. 1978; 88: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Macrophages are derived from peripheral blood monocytes that migrate to the lung where they undergo differentiation. Few studies have addressed the survival differences between alveolar macrophages and their precursor cells (21Liu H. Perlman H. Pagliari L.J. Pope R.M. J. Exp.

We have shown for the first time that human alveolar macrophages are deficient in PTEN and that this correlates with high constitutive expression of activated Akt. The decrease in PTEN can be reversed by blocking the alveolar macrophage specific high levels of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, differentiation plays a role in the process since PTEN is down regulated with in vitro differentiation of monocytes. PTEN, originally described as a tumor suppressor protein (39Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R.

https://openalex.org/W2062756298,"It has been suggested from in vivo and cryoelectron micrographic studies that the large ribosomal subunit protein L11 and its N-terminal domain play an important role in peptide release by, in particular, the class I release factor RF1. In this work, we have studied in vitro the role of L11 in translation termination with ribosomes from a wild type strain (WT-L11), an L11 knocked-out strain (ΔL11), and an L11 N terminus truncated strain (Cter-L11). Our data show 4-6-fold reductions in termination efficiency (kcat/Km) of RF1, but not of RF2, on ΔL11 and Cter-L11 ribosomes compared with wild type. There is, at the same time, no effect of these L11 alterations on the maximal rate of ester bond cleavage by either RF1 or RF2. The rates of dissociation of RF2 but not of RF1 from the ribosome after peptide release are somewhat reduced by the L11 changes irrespective of the presence of RF3, and they cause a 2-fold decrease in the missense error. Our results suggest that the L11 modifications increase nonsense suppression at UAG codons because of the reduced termination efficiency of RF1 and that they decrease nonsense suppression at UGA codons because of a decreased missense error level.

Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). This is also the site of action for the thiazole antibiotics thiostrepton and micrococcin (8.Wollenzien P. Expert-Bezancon A. Favre A.

In addition to the GTPases, some other translational factors interact with L11 and the L11BR in functionally important ways. The class I release factors RF1 and RF2 belong to this group. RF1 recognizes the stop codons UAG and UAA, whereas RF2 recognizes the stop codons UGA and UAA in the A site of the ribosome (11.Scolnick E. Tompkins R. Caskey T. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The L11 protein consists of two domains, a tightly folded N-terminal domain (NTD), which is loosely connected to the large compact C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD of L11 is in stable contact with the L11BR RNA, whereas the NTD can change its position and proximity with respect to the rest of the protein (19.Conn G.L. Draper D.E. Lattman E.E. Gittis A.G. Science. 1999; 284: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Earlier biochemical and genetic studies indicate that depletion of L11 from the ribosome inhibits RF1-mediated translation termination on a UAG codon but somewhat facilitates RF2-mediated termination on a UGA codon (4.Tate W.P. Schulze H. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12816-12820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Van Dyke N. Xu W. Murgola E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the NTD of L11 inhibit RF1-mediated termination, indicating that this part of L11 is crucial for RF1 binding (14.Tate W.P. Dognin M.J. Noah M. Stoffler-Meilicke M. Stoffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7317-7324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a bacterial strain, containing only the CTD of L11, efficient UAG suppression was seen as in the complete L11 knocked-out strain. This result shows that the NTD of L11 is required for proper functioning of RF1 (18.Van Dyke N. Murgola E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we have studied in vitro how ribosomedepletion of L11 or its NTD affects RF1- and RF2-mediated release of the tetrapeptide fMet-Phe-Thr-Ile (MFTI) from pretermination ribosomes prepared from a cell free system with E. coli components of high purity (20.Pavlov M.Y.

Biol. 2003; 330: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We have also studied the effects of L11 deletion or truncation on cognate and near cognate codon reading by tRNA. Taken together, our data on termination efficiency and missense error level explain why these L11 alterations lead to enhanced nonsense suppression at UAG codons, read by RF1, and decreased nonsense suppression at UGA codons, read by RF2 (4.Tate W.P.

The pretermination complexes were subjected to gel filtration using the Sephacryl S-300 matrix (Amersham Biosciences). The total ribosome concentration was determined from UV absorbance at 260 nm. The concentration of active release complex was estimated as the amount of radiolabeled tetrapeptide released after incubation with a release factor cognate to the A site codon present in excess over the ribosomes. The free tetrapeptide was identified in the supernatant after removal of the ribosomes and dropped off tRNAs by 5% trichloroacetic acid precipitation and centrifugation. The activity of different pretermination complexes was in the range from 60 to 85%. Peptide release by RF1 or RF2 in the absence or presence of RF3 in large excess can be described by Reaction 1. RF is either RF1 or RF2. RCpreMFTI and RF:RCpreMFTI are pretermination ribosome complexes carrying peptidyl-tRNAMFTI in the P site with and without a bound RF, respectively. RF:RCpost and RCpost are post-termination ribosome complexes carrying a deacylated tRNA in the P site with and without a bound RF, respectively. The rate constants for RF association to and dissociation from the pretermination ribosome are ka and kd, respectively. The rate constants for RF association to and dissociation from the post-termination ribosome in the absence or presence of RF3 in large excess are qa and qd, respectively, and the rate constant for ester bond hydrolysis is kc. The rate-limiting step of RF recycling is dissociation from the post-termination ribosome and, hence, the factor recycling rate is approximated by qd. The kcat/Km value (“efficiency”) for termination is defined as the association rate constant ka multiplied by the probability that RF binding to the pretermination ribosome leads to ester bond hydrolysis, as shown in Equation 1. kcatKm=ka1+kdkc (Eq. 1) The pretermination complexes with MFTI peptidyl-tRNA at the P site and any one of the three stop codons UAA, UAG, or UGA at the A site were made with ribosomes containing the full-length L11 (WT-L11), only C terminus of L11 (Cter-L11), and no L11 (ΔL11). To compare the kcat/Km values for termination at the WT-L11, Cter-L11, and ΔL11 complexes programmed with a particular stop codon, these were allowed to compete in pairs against each other for RF1- or RF2-dependent peptide release. One competing pretermination complex carried [3H]Ile and the other [14C]Ile on the P site-bound peptidyl-tRNA for quantification of the amount of peptide released from each complex. Reaction mixes were prepared by combining the competing pretermination complexes to a final active concentration of 100 nm each. Preincubation of the complexes for 1 min was followed by addition of RF1 or RF2 to final concentrations between 0 and 400 nm or between 0 and 180 nm, respectively, in a reaction volume of 25 μl. After a 20-s incubation at 37 °C, a time sufficient for complete single round but prohibitive of multiple round RF termination (27.Freistroffer D.V. Pavlov M.Y. MacDougall J. Buckingham R.H.

The amount of released MFTI tetrapeptide in the supernatant was quantified by radiometry by utilization of the Beckman Coulter LS6500 Multi Purpose Scintillation Counter, which enabled simultaneous measurement of both 3H and 14C radioisotopes in separate windows that were corrected for minimal interference (27.Freistroffer D.V. Pavlov M.Y. MacDougall J. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4126-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The time evolution of the competing reactions are described by Equations 2 and 3, dRC1dt=-[RF]·(kcatKm)1·RC1 (Eq. 2) dRC2dt=-[RF]·(kcatKm)2·RC2 (Eq. 3) where [RF] is the concentration of RF1 or RF2. RC1 and RC2 are the amounts of the two competing pretermination complexes. Because 1xdxdt=dlnxdt, dividing Equation 2 by RC1 and Equation 3 by RC2 leads to Equations 5 and 6. dln(RC1)dt=-[RF]·(kcatKm)1 (Eq. 5) dln(RC2)dt=-[RF]·(kcatKm)2 (Eq. 6) Division of Equation 5 by Equation 6 and integration over the 20-s incubation time leads to Equation 7, lnRC1-ln[RC1] t=0=r·(lnRC2-ln[RC2] t=0) (Eq. 7) where r=(kcatKm)1(kcatKm)2 Rearranging Equation 7 then leads to, r=ln((RC) 1[(RC) 1] t=0)ln((RC) 2[(RC) 2] t=0)=ln(1-PcPmax)1ln(1-PcPmax)2 where Pc is the amount of tetrapeptide released at a given concentration of release factor, Pmax is the total amount of releasable tetrapeptide, and 1 - (Pc/Pmax) is the peptide fraction remaining on peptidyl-tRNA in the pretermination complex after the incubation. Pretermination complexes (RCpreMFTI) made from WT-L11, Cter-L11, and ΔL11 ribosomes carrying MFTI-tRNA at the P site and different stop codons at the A site were prepared separately as described earlier. Peptide hydrolysis was initiated by rapid mixing of the RCpreMFTI complex with the release factor cognate to the stop codon in a quench flow instrument (Chemical-Quench-Flow model QF-3, KinTek Corp.). The postmixing concentration of the termination complex was 200 nm, and the postmixing release factor concentrations were 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 μm. The reaction was quenched after varying incubation times with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The extent of peptide release was quantified by radiometry as described above. At these concentrations of release factors, the rate-limiting step was ester bond hydrolysis. Accordingly, the time evolution of peptide release can be described by Equation 10. PtPmax=p(1-e-kt)+b (Eq. 10) Here, Pt and Pmax are the amounts of released peptide at time t and at infinite time, respectively. The OriginPro® fitting software was used to obtain the best fit to Equation 10 by varying parameters p and b. The pretermination complexes prepared as described above with a final active concentration of 100 nm were mixed with 10 nm RF1 or RF2 depending on the stop codon used. For the reactions with RF3 the reaction mix also contained 200 nm RF3 along with 1 mm GTP, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm ATP, and 0.05 μg/μl pyruvate kinase in 1× polymix buffer. After different times of incubation, aliquots were withdrawn, the reaction was quenched with 600 μl of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the released tetrapeptide was quantified from the supernatant by radiometry. The amounts of spontaneously released tetrapeptide in the absence of release factors were comparatively small and were subtracted as background. Under these conditions, the release factors had to cycle many times to remove all tetrapeptides from the pretermination complexes. The rates of recycling of the factors were estimated from the slopes of the straight lines in plots of the pmol (amount) of MFTI released/pmol of release factor versus time. Initiated ribosomes, containing [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet at the P site and a UUU codon at the A site, were prepared in an initiation mix, containing WT-L11, Cter-L11, or ΔL11 70 S ribosomes (2 μm active concentration), 4 μm [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet, 4 μm mRNA, IF1, IF2, and IF3 (2 μm each), and 1 mm GTP. Ternary complexes consisting of EF-Tu, GTP, and aminoacyl-tRNA were formed in an aminoacylation mix, containing for the cognate reaction 2 μm tRNAPhe, 2 μm EF-Tu, 0.2 μm EF-Ts, 0.5 unit/μl PheRS, 400 μm phenylalanine, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm GTP, 2 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.2 μg/ml myokinase. For the near cognate reaction the aminoacylation mix contained tRNAGAGLeu instead of tRNAPhe. Ribosome and ternary complex mixes were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C, mixed in equal volumes, incubated for varying times, and quenched by formic acid to a final concentration of 17%. For the cognate reaction time points were taken by a quench-flow instrument (Chemical-Quench-Flow model QF-3). Dipeptide formation was quantified by HPLC with an on-line radio detector (βRAM3; INUS, Inc.) from the ratio of the area of the [3H]fMet-Phe and [3H]fMet peaks. Samples for the HPLC were prepared and processed as described previously (32.Pavlov M.Y. Freistroffer D.V. Heurgue-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Selective Effects of L11 Alterations on the Termination Efficiencies of RF1 and RF2—We have compared the kinetic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of the release factors RF1 and RF2 in translation termination at UAA, UAG, and UGA codons in the A site of pretermination ribosomes, containing full-length L11 (WT-L11), NTD truncated L11 (Cter-L11), and no L11 (ΔL11). Pretermination complexes with the same stop codon but containing different variants of L11 were mixed in pairs and allowed to compete for RF1 (Fig. 1) or RF2 (Fig. 2) at varying concentrations. RF1 was used for complexes carrying either the UAA or UAG codon, whereas RF2 was used for complexes with the UAA or UGA codon. The reaction was stopped after 20 s, a time long enough for single round tetrapeptide release, but short enough to prevent multiple round peptide release. To differentiate between the tetrapeptides released from the two competing complexes, we have used 14C-labeled isoleucine ([14C]Ile) as the last amino acid in one complex and [3H]Ile in the other. In each set of experiments, the amount (pmol) of MFTI released was plotted as a function of the release factor concentration (A, C, and E in Figs. 1 and 2). For each release factor concentration we also plotted the negative (natural) logarithm of the fraction of tRNA-bound tetrapeptide on one ribosome complex versus the negative logarithm of the corresponding fraction on the competing ribosome. This generates a straight line with a slope that estimates the ratio between the kcat/Km values for termination at the two types of ribosome complex with high precision (B, D, and F in Figs. 1 and 2; data summarized in Table 2). Our experiments show that deletion of the N-terminal domain of L11 or of the whole L11 protein leads to a reduction of the RF1 termination efficiency at both UAA and UAG codons by a factor of 4 or 6, respectively (Fig. 1, B and D, and Table 2). When the Cter-L11 and ΔL11 complexes were competed for RF1, the ratio of kcat/Km values was 1.4 (Fig. 1, E and F, and Table 2), perfectly consistent with the kcat/Km ratios in the previous two cases, because 6/4 = 1.5, which is very close to 1.4. When similar competition experiments were performed for RF2, with different L11-containing pretermination complexes carrying either the UAA or UGA stop codon, the termination efficiency was reduced much less, only about 20 or 30% because of the N-terminal truncation and L11 deletion, respectively (Fig. 2 and Table 2).FIGURE 2Determination of the relative termination efficiency ((kcat/Km)RC1 ratio versus (kcat/Km)RC2 ratio) of RF2 on competing pretermination complexes (RC) with a UGA stop codon. The pretermination complexes containing WT-L11 (▪), Cter-L11 (○), and the ΔL11 (▵) were allowed to compete for RF2 in a pairwise manner to release the tetrapeptide fMet-Phe-Thr-Ile with time (A, C, and E). The relative termination efficiency of RF2 on the corresponding competing complexes was obtained from the slope of the linear curve when the negative natural logarithm of the fraction of tetrapeptide retained on one complex was plotted as a function of the same on the other of the competing pair (B, D, and F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 2Relative efficiencies of translation termination by RF1 and RF2RC1 vs. RC2Ratio of (kcat/Km)RC1a vs. (kcat/Km)RC2aRC, pretermination complexRF1RF2UAAUAGUAAUGAWT-L11 vs. Cter-L114.2 ± 0.24.4 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1WT-L11 vs. ΔL115.8 ± 0.26.0 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.1Cter-L11 vs. ΔL111.5 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.1a RC, pretermination complex Open table in a new tab Determination of the Intrinsic Rate Constant for Ester Bond Hydrolysis—The reduction of termination efficiency (kcat/Km) caused by N-terminal truncation of L11 or deletion of the whole protein (Table 2) could a priori be the result of (see “Experimental Procedures”) (i) a reduced intrinsic rate constant for ester bond hydrolysis (kc); (ii) a reduced rate constant for factor association (ka); or (iii) an increased rate constant for factor dissociation from the pretermination ribosome complex (kd). To clarify this question, we determined kc for cognate termination by RF1 or RF2 at a high concentration (1-3 μm) for all combinations of pretermination complexes (200 nm) and stop codons (Table 3). For all of the pretermination complexes the kc values for RF1- and RF2-mediated peptide release were estimated as ∼0.55 s-1 and 2.5 s-1, respectively (Table 3), in line with previous observations regarding wild type ribosomes (33.Freistroffer D.V.

The data showing the fraction of tetrapeptide released with time by RF1 and RF2 (3 μm) from the pretermination complexes (200 nm) with UAG and UGA stop codons, respectively, are presented in Fig. 3, A and C.

To further characterize new functionally relevant structures in these cells, we studied a series of monoclonal antibodies that we have raised against the NK cell line YT. One of these antibodies previously described as AY19, recognizes a 85 kD surface glycoprotein. Here we report the identification of a new secreted isoform of protocadherin 15, PCDH15C, which represents a potential associated protein for p85.

The nuclear matrix is a structural component inside the nucleus, to which chromatin binds via matrix (or scaffold) attachment regions (MARs) 2The abbreviations used are: MAR, matrix attachment region; BUR, base-unpairing region; m6A, N6-methyladenine; MBD, MAR-binding domain; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PDB, Protein Data Bank; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. 2The abbreviations used are: MAR, matrix attachment region; BUR, base-unpairing region; m6A, N6-methyladenine; MBD, MAR-binding domain; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PDB, Protein Data Bank; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. of the DNA, forming looped chromatin structures (1Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 16-22Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (353) Google Scholar). MARs are frequently located at the boundaries of transcription units where they are likely to delimit the ends of the active chromatin domains in terms of transcription as well as replication (1Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 16-22Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The MAR sequences commonly contain regions where base pairs tend to break under an unwinding stress (base-unpairing region (BUR)), which is important in binding to the nuclear matrix (2Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Miklke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Science. 1992; 255: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). SATB1 (from special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1) was initially identified as a factor that specifically binds to the BUR sequence, which is predominantly expressed in thymus (3Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In thymocytes, SATB1 recruits histone deacetylase complex to the MAR site inside the transcription of the interleukin-2 receptor α gene, in order to repress their expression in the premature T-cells (4Yasui D. Miyano M. Cai S. Varga-Weisz P. Kowhi-Shigematsu T. Nature. 2002; 419: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Indeed, SATB1-null mice exhibit irregular expression of interleukin-2 receptor α and related genes in the premature gene CD4+ CD8+ T-cells, which caused small thymi and spleens and death at the age of 3 weeks (5Alvarez J.D. Yasui D.H. Niida H. Joh T. Loh D.Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 521-535PubMed Google Scholar). SATB1 also regulates the expression of fetal globin genes in the erythroid progenitor cells by directly binding to MARs in the locus control region and the ∈-globin promoter region in the β-globin cluster (6Wen J. Huang S. Rogers H. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Noguchi C.T. Blood. 2005; 105: 3330-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Inside the cells, SATB1 is localized at nuclei and surrounds heterochromatin, forming a cage-like network structure (7Cai S. Han H.J. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). SATB1 is ∼800 amino acids in length, in which a region of ∼150 amino acids located nearly in the middle (Tyr346-Asn495) is originally reported to be relevant to binding to the MAR DNA (MAR-binding domain (MBD)) (8Nakagomi K. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1852-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This protein also contains a homeodomain located at a more C-terminal region, which alone does not show significant DNA binding activity but enhances the activity of MBD (9Dickinson L.A. Dickinson C.D. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11463-11470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The MBD sequence possesses a similarity to the CUT DNA-binding motif that is found in a group of DNA-binding proteins also containing a homeodomain at a more C-terminal region (10Lannoy V.L. Brüglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, a four-helix structure of the CUT domain of hepatocyte nuclear factor 6α has been determined (11Sheng W. Yan H. Rausa III, F.M. Costa R.H. Liao X. J. Biol.

Although this structure showed similarity to those of the POU-specific domains of POU-homologous proteins (12Dekker N. Cox M. Boelens R. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P. Kaptein R.

Cell. 1993; 73: 193-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the DNA-binding mechanism of the CUT domain is yet unknown. In this study, a three-dimensional structure of SATB1-MBD was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure consists of five α-helices packing together into a globular shape, which possesses an additional helix as compared with the HNF6α CUT domain structure. In addition, the DNA-binding mode was elucidated by NMR titration, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and point mutation experiments and was proposed to be similar to that by POU-specific domains. Sample Preparation—The cDNA that codes for the SATB1 MAR-binding region (Tyr346-Asn495) was amplified from Quick Clone™ human thymus cDNA mixture (Clontech), by PCR using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara), and was subcloned into the NdeI-BamHI cloning site of pET15b vector (Novagen). Shorter fragments, Val353-Asn490, Asn368-Lys475, and Asn368-Ala455, were also produced by PCR from the above vector. The isotope-labeled and unlabeled proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli cells, as described previously (14Reay P. Yamasaki K. Terada T. Kuramitsu S. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinfo. 2004; 56: 40-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) and Sephadex G-75 (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography. The buffers used were 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 10-250 mm imidazole for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow chromatography and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.5) for Sephadex G-75 chromatography. Protein concentration was determined by A280 values, and molar absorption coefficients were calculated from the amino acid sequences. For NMR measurements, ∼1.3-1.7 mm proteins were dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.5 mm sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate, and 5% D2O, unless otherwise stated.

HSQC spectra of samples containing 100% D2O were recorded at 293 K, by which 43 hydrogen bond donors were identified. By using the HMQC-J experiment (18Kay L.E. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 86: 110-126Google Scholar), 80 3JHNHα coupling values in the calculated region (see below) were obtained. By analyzing the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, and double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy spectra, 25 and 4 pairs of H-β and valine H-γ resonances, respectively, in the calculated region were assigned stereospecifically. The distance constraints derived from the nuclear Overhauser effect spectra and those maintaining hydrogen bonds were imposed as described (17Yamasaki K. Kigawa T. Inoue M. Tateno M. Yamasaki T.

The φ angle constraints were classified into three categories, -120 ± 50°, -60 ± 30°, and -100 ± 70°, corresponding to the 3JαN coupling values of >8.5, <6.0, and 6.0-8.5 Hz, respectively. For stereospecifically assigned residues, χ1 torsion angle constraints, classified into three categories, 60 ± 40°, 180 ± 40°, and -60 ± 40°, were imposed. Structure was calculated for the Asn368-Ala455 region, because more N-terminal and C-terminal regions appeared to be unstructured in the NMR spectra, and resonance assignments were not completed mainly because of the cross-peak overlapping. Indeed, NMR spectra of the Asn368-Ala455 fragment were very similar to those of the fragment Val353-Asn490, as described under “Results.” Random simulated annealing (20Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) was carried out by using the program CNS (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

SPR—Experiments were carried out at 293 or 288 K using a BiaCORE X apparatus (BIAcore). The running buffer was 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.005% Tween 20. A total of 338 and 522 resonance units of two double-stranded DNAs (5′-bio-CGTTTCTAATATATGC-3′/5′-GCATATATTAGAAACG-3′, the BUR nucleation sequence (22Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) is underlined, and 5′-bio-GGGCATGTATCTTGAATC-3′/5′-GATTCAAGATACATGCCC-3′, respectively, where “bio” indicates biotinylation at the 5′ end) were immobilized on the surfaces of Sensor Chip SAs (BIAcore) in one (flow cell 2) of the two flow cells, so that the other (flow cell 1) is treated as the control. Solutions containing the protein at concentrations of 5 nm to 5 μm were injected into the flow cells at 20 μl min-1 for 5 min. The equilibrium binding constant was estimated by fitting the equilibrium response values at different protein concentrations to the simple 1:1 binding model using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore). For concentration-response profiles that do not appear to be saturated within the experimental concentration range, the saturation levels were constrained to the maximal response value expected when the protein molecules bind to all the immobilized DNA molecules at 1:1 stoichiometry. The standard deviations in four repeated experiments were used as the error levels. Essentially the same experiments were performed with DNAs containing methylated bases: 5′-bio-CGTTTCTAATATATGC-3′/5′-GCATATATTm6AGAAACG-3′ and 5′-bio-CGTTTCTAATATATGC-3′/5′-GCATATm6ATTAGAAACG-3′ or in the presence of distamycin (Sigma), methyl green (Funakoshi, Japan), or spermine (Wako, Japan). Because methylation at the N6H2 group of adenine base destabilizes the DNA double strands (23Yamasaki T. Yamasaki K. Suzuki M. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 1998; 74: 210-215Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), experiments using methylated DNAs were performed at 288 K. Experiments were also performed for the Val353-Asn490 fragment in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), which confirmed that the phosphate ions in the phosphate buffer do not interfere with the DNA binding (data not shown). NMR Titration Analysis—1H-15N HSQC spectra of the protein at the initial concentration of 0.31 mm were recorded at 293 K by adding increasing amounts of 7.8 mm of the double-stranded 16-mer DNA (5′-CGTTTCTAATATATGC-3′/5′-GCATATATTAGAAACG-3′) (the BUR nucleation sequence (22Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) is underlined). The concentration of the double-stranded DNA was determined by using an extinction coefficient calculated after digestion of the strands with phosphodiesterase I (Worthington). Heteronuclear three-dimensional spectra of SATB1-MBD in the complex with DNA were recorded in order to confirm assignments of backbone 1H and 15N resonances. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A series of point mutations (Table 2) were introduced on the SATB1-MBD (Val353-Asn490) expression plasmid, using QuickChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). After annealing of primers of 30 bases containing mutated triplet codons, DNA strands were elongated by KOD Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The mutant proteins were prepared essentially as described above, and SPR experiments were performed also as described above. The error levels in the ratios of the binding constants of the wild-type and mutant proteins (KAWT/KAmut) were evaluated as (σ2WTK2Amut + σ2mutK2AWT)1/2/K2Amut, where KAWT and KAmut represent the binding constants of wild-type and mutant proteins, respectively, and σWT and σmut represent the error levels in KAWT and KAmut, respectively.TABLE 2Binding constants of SATB1-MBD (Val353-Asn490) and MAR-DNA determined by SPRMutationLocationKAaError levels were estimated as described under “Materials and Methods.”-Fold DecreaseaError levels were estimated as described under “Materials and Methods.”M−1Wild type4.8E6 ± 6.0E5R380Nα11.1E6 ± 1.7E54.5 ± 0.9K384Nα12.6E5 ± 2.4E418.7 ± 2.9R395Nα21.1E6 ± 8.7E44.6 ± 0.7R410Nα31.3E5 ± 1.9E436.8 ± 7.0K416Nloop 34bLoop is between α3 and α4.3.6E5 ± 7.6E413.4 ± 3.3R427Nα41.6E6 ± 1.2E53.1 ± 0.5R442Nα51.0E6 ± 7.0E44.7 ± 0.7K475NC-loopcLoop is C-terminal to α5.6.3E5 ± 5.1E47.7 ± 1.1S373AN-loopdLoop is N-terminal to α1.3.9E6 ± 3.8E51.2 ± 0.2S406Aα34.4E5 ± 1.4E411.0 ± 1.4S451AC-loop3.6E6 ± 9.7E51.4 ± 0.4a Error levels were estimated as described under “Materials and Methods.”b Loop is between α3 and α4.c Loop is C-terminal to α5.d Loop is N-terminal to α1. Open table in a new tab Modeling of Complex of SATB1-MBD and DNA—Starting from an initial model in which the side of the protein containing the residues with largely affected chemical shifts in the NMR titration experiment was oriented to the major groove side of a standard B-DNA, the most energetically favored structure was selected by a careful and systematic search, essentially as described previously (17Yamasaki K. Kigawa T. Inoue M. Tateno M. Yamasaki T. Yabuki T. Aoki M. Seki E. Matsuda T. Nunokawa E. Ishizuka Y. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Osanai T. Tanaka A. Seki M. Shinozaki K. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). MAR-binding Domain and CUT Domain—MAR-binding domain region was originally assigned to be Tyr346-Asn495 for murine SATB1 protein, where the human counterpart possesses a nearly identical sequence (8Nakagomi K. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1852-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We have initially expressed and purified a fragment corresponding to this region, and we found that the fragment contained significantly unfolded region(s) by NMR analyses (data not shown). Therefore, we prepared shorter fragments Val353-Asn490, Asn368-Lys475, and Asn368-Ala455. All of them were expressed well and successfully purified. Comparison of the NMR spectra suggested that the shortest fragment contains most of the region with folded property and the longer ones possess additional unstructured region(s) (data not shown). The abilities of the above fragments to bind to a DNA containing a MAR sequence (the BUR nucleation sequence; see Ref. 22Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were evaluated by SPR experiments (Fig. 2, a and b). The original MBD region fragment (Tyr346-Asn495) and a slightly shorter fragment (Val353-Asn490) were demonstrated to bind to the DNA with similar constants (3.7 (±0.4) × 106m-1 and 4.8 (±0.6) × 106m-1 binding, respectively) (Fig. 2b). The response ratio of the maximal binding of the protein to the DNA immobilized on the sensor chip suggests that SATB1-MBD binds to this DNA at a stoichiometry of 1:1. Nonspecific binding to a DNA with an unrelated sequence was shown to be very weak, which indicates the recognition specificity to the MAR sequence. In contrast to above, fragment Asn368-Lys475 showed significantly weaker binding, and the shortest fragment Asn368-Ala455, most close to the CUT domain region (Fig. 1), showed even lower activity (Fig. 2b). This is probably because the deletion reduced the net charges of the fragments at neutral pH (difference between the numbers of basic and acidic residues), which need to be positive enough to stably bind to the negatively charged DNA, i.e. the net charges are +2, +2, +1, and -1 for fragments Tyr346-Asn495, Val353-Asn490, Asn368-Lys475, and Asn368-Ala455, respectively. Indeed, decreasing the pH value to 4.0 partially recovered the binding activity of fragment Asn368-Ala455 (data not shown). Also, another fragment containing Asn368-Leu452 and additional four basic residues at the C terminus showed a strong sequence-specific binding (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that the CUT domain region is mainly responsible for the MAR-DNA binding, although the other unstructured regions contribute to the strong binding at least by increasing the net charges. Considering the above, we used the fragment Val353-Asn490 as SATB1-MBD for all the experiment hereafter unless otherwise stated. Structural Description—Although the NMR analyses were performed on the Val353-Asn490 fragment, the structure was calculated for region Asn368-Ala455, because the N-terminal and C-terminal regions appear to be largely unfolded as described above. The experimental constraints and stereochemical properties of the NMR solution structure of SATB1-MBD are shown in Table 1. The secondary structure elements are 5 α-helices (α1, Glu374-Ala386; α2, Gln390-Ala397; α3, Leu404-Lys411; α4, Gln420-Gln434; and α5, Glu437-Gln445), as identified by the program Procheck-NMR (24Laskowski R.A. Rullman J.A.C. MacArthur W.M. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4358) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and 3). These helices pack against one another, forming a globular shape as a whole. The packing of the helices was achieved by hydrophobic interactions between side chains, many of which are those of aliphatic or aromatic residues, i.e. Ile375, Tyr376, Trp378, Val379, Glu382, and Leu383 of α1; Gln390, Phe393, Ala394, Val396, and Ala397 of α2; Leu404, Leu405, Ile408, and Leu409 of α3; Leu422, Leu426, Met429, Gln430, Phe432, and Leu433 of α4; and Arg440, Ile443, and Tyr444 of α5, as defined by average C-C distances of less than 4.5 Å in the structural ensemble. In addition, Val371, Ile388, and Phe398 in the loop regions contribute to formation of the structural core, through hydrophobic interactions. Also, an electrostatic interaction between Glu382 and Arg440 side chains, with an average O--H+ distance of 3.2 Å, is likely to contribute to the packing of α-helices 1 and 5.TABLE 1Structural statisticsStructural constraintsSequential NOEs324Medium range NOEs (2 ≤| i - j| ≤ 4)372Long range NOEs (| i - j| > 4)293Hydrogen bonds86Torsion (φ) angles80Torsion (χ1) angles29Total1,184CharacteristicsEnsemble of 20 structuresMinimized mean structureRoot mean square deviation from constraintsNOEs and hydrogen bonds (Å)0.0005 ± 0.00030.003Torsion angles (°)0.010 ± 0.0060.046van der Waals energy (kcal/mol)aValues calculated with the force field for NMR structure determination in the CNS package (21).3.7 ± 0.53.9Root mean square deviation from the ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.0006 ± 0.00000.0007Bond angles (°)0.280 ± 0.0010.281Improper angles (°)0.086 ± 0.0010.091Average root mean square deviation from the unminimized mean structure (Å)bValues calculated with Val371-Gln445.N, C-α, C0.52 ± 0.10All heavy atoms1.09 ± 0.09Ramachandran plotMost favored region (%)85.682.9Additionally allowed region (%)13.917.1Generously allowed region (%)0.40.0Disallowed region (%)0.10.0a Values calculated with the force field for NMR structure determination in the CNS package (21).b Values calculated with Val371-Gln445. Open table in a new tab It should be noted that many of the above residues, except for those in α-helix 5, are conserved among the CUT domains (Fig. 1, top), indicating that the domains of these proteins share a common structural architecture except for α5. Indeed, structure of the CUT domain of hepatocyte nuclear factor 6α has been reported to possess four helices (11Sheng W. Yan H. Rausa III, F.M. Costa R.H. Liao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33928-33936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which corresponds to α1-4 of SATB1-MBD. More will be described on the structural comparisons below under “Discussion.” Binding to the Major Groove of DNA—To test to which groove of DNA SATB1-MBD binds, SPR experiments employing DNAs methylated on the major groove side and groove-specific binding drugs, such as methyl green (major groove binding; Ref. 25Norden B. Tjerneld F. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1977; 50: 508-512Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), spermine (major groove binding; Ref. 26Drew H.R. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 535-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), and distamycin (minor groove binding; Ref. 27Luck G. Triebel H. Waring M. Zimmer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1974; 1: 503-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), were carried out. When a DNA containing an m6A base outside the BUR nucleation sequence (5′-CGTTTCTAATATATGC-3′/5′-GCATATATTm6AGAAACG-3′; the BUR nucleation sequence (22Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) is underlined), the binding ability of SATB1-MBD is only slightly affected (Fig. 2c). In contrast, binding to another DNA containing an m6A base in the BUR nucleation sequence (5′-CGTTTCTAATATATGC-3′/5′-GCATATm6ATTAGAAACG-3′) is weaker by ∼40-fold than that of the DNA without modification (Fig. 2c). Because the N6H2 group of adenine base is exposed to the major groove side of DNA, the above results indicate that SATB1-MBD binds to the BUR nucleation sequence from the major groove side. Consistently, experiments using the groove-specific DNA-binding drugs showed the major groove binding of SATB1-MBD, namely the presence of 50 μm distamycin did not affect the DNA binding of SATB1-MBD, although presence of 50 μm methyl green or spermine significantly reduced the apparent affinity of the protein (Fig. 2c). Therefore, it was concluded that SATB1-MBD binds to the DNA from the major groove side. Interface for DNA Binding—The protein surface involved in the DNA binding tends to be positively charged to bind to negatively charged DNA. On the surface of the SATB1-MBD structure, a characteristic array of positively charged amino acid side chains, i.e. Lys411-Arg410-Arg380-Lys384-Arg385, is observed (Fig. 3c). These residues are conserved in the SATB proteins and either of CUT domains of ONECUT group or Cux/CDP proteins and are considered to be candidate residues that form the interface for DNA binding (Fig. 1). As described later, the first four residues of this array are suggested to be involved in the DNA binding. To elucidate the protein-DNA interface, an NMR titration experiment was carried out (Fig. 4a). By adding increasing amounts of the DNA, chemical shift perturbations were observed in the HSQC spectra as follows. The positions of some cross-peaks did not change at all, or they shift only slightly so that the chemical shift changes were easy to follow (e.g. Ser372, Ser373, Phe398, Glu437, and Gln430 H-∈ in Fig. 4a). For some cross-peaks, even though the differences were significant, the change could be followed as the fast-exchange manner and/or resonances were assigned by analyses of three-dimensional spectra (e.g. Asp381, Asp414, Leu409, and Arg427 in Fig. 4a). For others, however, the changes could not be followed, for which distances to the nearest unassigned cross-peaks of the complex were temporarily considered as the chemical shift difference or classification into the highest category was applied if there were no such candidate peaks within the classification limit ((ΔδH2 + (ΔδN/5.0)2)1/2 ≥0.2 ppm) (e.g. Gln390, Thr401, Gln402, Gln420, and Gln390 (H-∈) in Fig. 4a). This treatment may cause underestimation of the difference but causes no overestimation except for the case where a strong exchange broadening occurs without large change in the chemical shift. The chemical shift perturbations were completed when the concentration ratio of DNA to protein reached ∼1.0, which suggested a 1:1 binding stoichiometry of the protein-DNA interaction. After classifying the residues according to their chemical shift differences, it became apparent that a relatively limited region of the structure was largely affected by the binding of DNA (Fig. 4b). These regions are loop between α1 and α2 (loop 12), α3, loop between α3 and α4 (loop 34), and α4. In contrast, most residues of α1 and α5 are not significantly affected. Considering the above, a model of the complex of SATB1-MBD and DNA was built using a computational approach (Fig. 4b). In this model, α-helix 3 deeply enters the major groove of the DNA in such a way that the axis of the α-helix is nearly perpendicular to that of the DNA double helix. Accordingly, the side chains of Ser406, Glu407, Arg410, and Lys411 in α3 contact the DNA bases of the ∼4-bp region, probably forming hydrogen bonds. The side chains of Arg380, Lys384, Ser389, Gln390, Arg400, Arg410, Ser419, and Ser421, and the backbone amide of Gln390 form intermolecular hydrogen bonds to the DNA phosphate groups. The NMR titration experiment is highly consistent with these interactions, e.g. cross-peaks of both the si"

It is synthesized in five steps from pantothenate, and recently the CoaA biosynthetic genes of eubacteria, plants, and human were all identified and cloned. In most bacteria, the so-called Dfp proteins catalyze the synthesis of the coenzyme A precursor 4′-phosphopantetheine. Dfp proteins are bifunctional enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (CoaB activity) and its decarboxylation to 4′-phosphopantetheine (CoaC activity). Here, we demonstrate the functional characterization of the CoaB and CoaC domains of an archaebacterial Dfp protein. Both domains of the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii Dfp protein were purified as His tag proteins, and their enzymatic activities were then identified and characterized by site-directed mutagenesis. Although the nucleotide binding motif II of the CoaB domain resembles that of eukaryotic enzymes, Methanocaldococcus CoaB is a CTP- and not an ATP-dependent enzyme, as shown by detection of the 4′-phosphopantothenoyl-CMP intermediate. The proposed 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine binding clamp of the Methanocaldococcus CoaC activity differs significantly from those of other characterized CoaC proteins. In particular, the active site cysteine residue, which otherwise is involved in the reduction of an aminoenethiol reaction intermediate, is not present. Moreover, the conserved Asn residue of the PXMNXXMW motif, which contacts the carboxyl group of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine, is exchanged for His.

Coenzyme A (CoA) and 4′-phosphopantetheine (PP) 2The abbreviations used are: PP, 4′-phosphopantetheine; HFCD, homo-oligomeric flavin-dependent Cys decarboxylase; MBP, maltose-binding protein from Escherichia coli; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PPC, (R)-4′-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine; RPC, reversed phase chromatography; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine; wt, wild type. are essential cofactors for many enzymatic reactions, and acyl-CoA derivatives are key intermediates in energy metabolism. 4′-Phosphopantetheine is a cofactor of enzymes that play a role in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, polypeptide antibiotics, and polyketides. The thiol group of the cysteamine moiety of coenzyme A is the functional group because it activates substrates as thioesters. Coenzyme A is synthesized from pantothenate in five steps, and all of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of the cofactor in eubacteria, plants, and human have recently been cloned and characterized. In the first step, pantothenate is phosphorylated to 4′-phosphopantothenate by pantothenate kinase, which is encoded by the coaA gene. Then, (R)-4′-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC) is synthesized by the addition of cysteine to 4′-phosphopantothenate (CoaB activity), and in the next step, PPC is decarboxylated to 4′-phosphopantetheine (CoaC activity). 4′-Phosphopantetheine is converted to coenzyme A by the enzymes 4′-phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (CoaD) and dephospho-CoA kinase (CoaE; reviewed in Ref. 1Leonardi R. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 125-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The key reaction in coenzyme A biosynthesis, the synthesis of the phosphopeptide-like cofactor 4′-phosphopantetheine from 4′-phosphopantothenate and cysteine, is catalyzed in Escherichia coli and in most eubacteria by the bifunctional Dfp (CoaBC) flavoprotein in a multistep process (Fig. 1) (2Kupke T.

The nucleobase binding motif II of eubacterial CTP-binding CoaBs deviates from that of eukaryotic ATP-binding PPC synthetases. In E. coli Dfp the sequence reads 307NPDIV, whereas the sequence is 210VPKLL in the human enzyme (residues shown in boldface are those conserved in eubacterial/eukaryotic enzymes). In the next step, PPC is oxidatively decarboxylated to 4′-phosphopantothenoylaminoenethiol by the NH2-terminal FMN-binding CoaC domain of Dfp (6Hernández-Acosta P. Schmid D.G. Jung G.

The presence of conserved CoA biosynthetic genes indicates that all Archaea convert 4′-phosphopantothenate into coenzyme A by using CoaB, CoaC, CoaD, and CoaE activities, although cloning and functional characterization of archaebacterial coenzyme A biosynthetic genes has not been published until now (11Genschel U.

The 5′-coaC part and the 3′-coaB part of the archaebacterial dfp gene were expressed in E. coli, and the purified His tag proteins His-CoaB and His-CoaC were characterized functionally. Although several active site residues of eubacterial and eukaryotic CoaC activities are not conserved in Methanocaldococcus Dfp (12Kupke T. J. Biol.

We show that M. jannaschii CoaB is a CTP-dependent enzyme, although the nucleotide binding motif II contains a Lys residue, which is characteristic for the ATP-dependent PPC synthetases (5Stanitzek S. Augustin M.A. Huber R. Kupke T. Steinbacher S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1977-1988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Materials—All PCR amplifications were performed with Vent-DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). For amplification of parts of the dfp gene, purified chromosomal DNA of M. jannaschii DSM 2661 was used (DSMZ, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen, Braunschweig, Germany). Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech. Cloning of coaB from M. jannaschii—The 3′ part of the dfp gene encoding the carboxyl-terminal CoaB domain Asn190–Ser403 of M. jannaschii Dfp was amplified by PCR and cloned into the single BamHI site of the epression vector pQE8 (Qiagen). For PCR amplification, the primers (i) forward, 5′-GTTATTGAAAAAATCAGATCTAACTTAAAAAAAG-3′, and (ii) reverse, 5′-CCCAGCACTTGTTGCA-GATCTAGTTTCTTCTCT-3′, were used (nucleotides shown in bold letters were exchanged compared with the sequence of the chromosomal DNA to introduce the BglII sites (underlined)). The amplified coaB gene was digested with BglII and cloned into pQE8 BamHI. The pQE8-derived plasmids were transformed into the expression strain E. coli M15 (pREP4) (Qiagen) by electroporation. The expression plasmid pQE8 coaB encodes an NH2-terminal His tag fusion protein of the M. jannaschii CoaB protein (His-CoaB: MRGSHHHHHHGS-Dfp-Asn190-Ser403). Cloning of coaC from M. jannaschii—The 5′ part of the dfp gene encoding the amino-terminal CoaC domain, Met1–Arg197, of M. jannaschii Dfp was amplified by PCR and cloned into the single BamHI site of the epression vector pQE8 (Qiagen). For PCR amplification, the following primers, (i) forward, 5′-GGTTTAAAGATCTATGATAAGTGAAATCATGC-3′, and (ii) reverse, 5′-CTCCGTTTAATATTAAAGATCTATTTCCTTC-3′, were used. The amplified coaC gene was digested with BglII and cloned into pQE8 BamHI as described above. The expression plasmid pQE8 coaC encodes an NH2-terminal His tag fusion protein of the M. jannaschii CoaC protein (His-CoaC: MRGSHHHHHHGS-Dfp-Met1-Arg197-Ser) (the additional serine residue at the COOH terminus was introduced because of the cloning procedure used). Site-directed Mutagenesis of coaB and coaC—All point mutations were introduced by using sequential PCR and appropriate mutagenesis primers as described recently (14Cormack B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1.in: Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991: 8.5.1-8.5.9Google Scholar). For the PCR mutagenesis of coaB, pQE8 coaB was used as template, and the oligonucleotides (i) forward, 5′-CAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCAC-3′, and (ii) reverse, 5′-CAGCTAATTAAGCTTAAGATCTAGTTTC-3′, were used as terminal primers (the introduced BglII site underlined). For the PCR mutagenesis of coaC,pQE8 coaC was used as template and the oligonucleotides (i) forward, 5′-CAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCAC-3′, and (ii) reverse, 5′-AATCCAGATGGAGATCTGAGGTCATTAC-3′, were used as terminal primers (introduced BglII site is underlined). The amplified coaB and coaC genes, respectively, were digested with EcoRI/BglII and cloned into pQE12 EcoRI/BglII. The pQE12-derived plasmids were transformed into the expression strain E. coli M15 (pREp4) (Qiagen) by electroporation. The entire sequences of the coding regions of the constructed pQ12 plasmids were verified. Because of the cloning procedure, the pQ12 plasmids encode the same His tag proteins as the pQE8 plasmids except for the introduced point mutation. Growth of Strains—The E. coli strains used were grown to A578 = 0.4 in 0.5 liters of B-broth (10 g casein hydrolysate 140 (Invitrogen), 5 g of yeast extract (Difco), 5 g of NaCl, 1 g of glucose, and 1 g of K2HPO4/liter, pH 7.3) in 2-liter shaker flasks, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and harvested 2 h after induction. Growth temperature was 37 °C. Purification of M. jannaschii His-CoaB and His-CoaC Proteins by Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography—For purification of His-CoaB and His-CoaC proteins, 500 ml of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced E. coli M15 (pREP4, pQE8/12 coaB/coaC) cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in 10 ml 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). A cleared lysate obtained by two centrifugation steps (each for 20 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C) was adjusted to 0.3 m NaCl/50 mm imidazol and then applied at room temperature to Ni-NTA resin equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl). His-CoaB and His-CoaC proteins, respectively, were eluted with column buffer containing 1 m instead of 50 mm imidazole. For activity assays (see below), the Ni-NTA eluates were used. For detection of copurified 4′-phosphopantothenoyl-CMP intermediates, His-CoaB proteins were treated with trifluoroacetic acid, denaturated proteins were centrifuged down, and the supernatant was subjected to reversed phase chromatography (RPC). 4′-Phosphopantothenoyl-CMP was identified by its retention time and absorbance properties. Gel Filtration of His-CoaC—For gel filtration of His-CoaC, a 25-μl aliquot of the Ni-NTA eluate was subjected to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated in running buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl) at a flow rate 40 μl/min. The Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column and the standard proteins used for calibration were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The elution volumes of the standard proteins were determined to be the following (see Fig. 3D): thyroglobulin (peak 1, 669 kDa), 1.007 ml; ferritin (peak 2, 440 kDa), 1.138 ml; catalase (peak 3, 232 kDa), 1.306 ml; aldolase (peak 4, 158 kDa), 1.333 ml; albumin (peak 5, 67 kDa), 1.450 ml; ovalbumin (peak 6, 43 kDa), 1.548 ml; chymotrypsinogen A (peak 7, 25 kDa), 1.730 ml; and ribonuclease (peak 8, 13.7 kDa), 1.786 ml. The void volume of the column was determined by using dextran blue 2000. Purification of Helper Enzymes Used in the Activity Assays—E. coli His-CoaA and Arabidopsis thaliana MBP (maltose-binding protein)-AtCoaD were purified as described recently (3Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36137-36145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38229-38237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE—Proteins were separated using Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (16Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Prestained molecular weight standards were obtained from New England Biolabs. PPC Synthetase and PPC Decarboxylase Assay—Because 4′-phosphopantothenate is not commercially available, it was synthesized enzymatically by adding E. coli His-CoaA, pantothenate, and ATP to the PPC synthetase assay mixtures (3Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36137-36145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, 1 ml of the assay mixture contained 5 mm pantothenate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5–10 mm ATP, 5 mm CTP, 5 mm l-cysteine hydrochloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and His-CoaA (∼15–25 μg). After a 20–30 min preincubation at 37 °C to convert pantothenate to 4′-phosphopantothenate, either M. jannaschii His-CoaB or M. jannaschii His-CoaB and His-CoaC proteins together were added in the range of 5 to 25 μg. After 45 min of incubation at 37 or 60 °C (we did not perform the assays at the M. jannaschii growth temperature of about 80 °C because of potential problems with the stability of assay components), the reaction mixtures were kept at –80 °C and then were separated successively by reversed phase chromatography with a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). Compounds were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile-0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 5.8 ml with a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The absorbance was measured simultaneously at 214, 260, and 280 nm to enable identification of reaction products. 4′-Phosphopantetheine Adenylyltransferase Assay—Because the direct detection of PPC and PP is complicated by the low absorbance of the substances at 214 nm and the missing absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, we used a second assay in which PP was converted to dephospho-CoA by adding phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase activity (MBP-AtCoaD) to the reaction mixture (concentrations of ATP and Mg2+ were increased to 10 and 15 mm, respectively); the MBP-AtCoaD used is specific for PP and cannot ligate AMP to PPC (15Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38229-38237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Synthesized dephospho-CoA was identified by its absorbance properties and by comparison of the retention time in RPC with chemically synthesized dephospho-CoA (Sigma) (15Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38229-38237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequence Comparison of M. jannaschii 4′-Phosphopantetheine Biosynthetic Genes coaB and coaC—The complete genome sequence of M. jannaschii was published as early as 1996 (17Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F.

Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar), and the dfp gene is annotated in the data banks. Several but not all residues shown to be important for PPC synthetase and decarboxylase activity and/or substrate or cofactor binding in eubacterial and eukaryotic enzymes are conserved in M. jannaschii Dfp (Fig. 2) (2Kupke T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 3Kupke T. J. Biol.

From sequence comparisons, we propose that the 16-amino acid peptide 164PKFEEGKAKVANIEDV179 corresponds to substrate recognition clamp 151PDSGSQACGDIGPGRM166 the of the E. coli Dfp protein (10Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however the active site cysteine residue 158 is not conserved in the M. jannaschii protein. Mutation of Cys158 to Ala or Ser led to loss of PPC decarboxylase activity in E. coli Dfp (12Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Crystal structure analysis of the plant PPC decarboxylase At HAL3a complexed with the oxidatively decarboxylated reaction intermediate suggested that reduction of the Cα=Cβ double bond of this intermediate can be performed by direct hydride transfer from N-5 of FMNH2 to Cβ supported by protonation of Cα by the conserved cysteine residue (8Steinbacher S. Hernández-Acosta P. Bieseler B. Blaesse M. Huber R. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. Kupke T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The function of the conserved cysteine residue as active site acid in the protonation on the enethiolate intermediate is further supported by mechanistic studies on the human PPC decarboxylase (9Strauss E. Zhai H. Brand L.A. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15520-15533Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is not clear which residue of the M. jannaschii PPC decarboxylase functionally aligns with this active site cysteine residue. A second residue that is important for the decarboxylase activity is also not conserved in M. jannaschii Dfp. In peptidyl-cysteine decarboxylases (LanD enzymes) and most eubacterial and eukaryotic PPC decarboxylases an Asn residue is conserved in the so-called PXM-NXXMW motif and proposed to be involved in binding of the COOH group of the substrates (8Steinbacher S. Hernández-Acosta P. Bieseler B. Blaesse M. Huber R. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. Kupke T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); in the M. jannaschii enzyme this Asn residue is exchanged for His (His139). To characterize the PPC synthetase and decarboxylase activities of the M. jannaschii enzyme, the 5′ part (encoding the CoaC domain Met1–Arg197) and the 3′ part (encoding the CoaB domain Asn190–Ser403) of the dfp gene were cloned in the pQE8 expression vector. The coding regions of both plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression, Purification, and Characterization of 4′-Phosphopantetheine Biosynthetic Enzymes—The M. jannaschii His-CoaB and His-CoaC proteins were purified from overexpressing E. coli clones in a single immobilized metal affinity chromatography purification step (purity of the enzymes was verified by SDS-PAGE; data not shown). To obtain information about the cofactor dependence of His-CoaB, we analyzed the mutant enzyme His-CoaB N217H. Recently, it residues has been shown Arg206, Asn210 that, and Ala276 of E. coli CoaB are involved in the second half-reaction of the PPC synthesis and that the 4′-phosphopantothenoyl-CMP intermediate is copurified with mutant E. coli His-CoaB N210K protein but not with E. coli His-CoaB wt (2Kupke T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 3Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36137-36145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This residue, Asn210, corresponds to residue Asn217 in M. jannaschii CoaB. Treatment of M. jannaschii His-CoaB N217H with trifluoroacetic acid and RPC separation of the copurified substances revealed that also in this case 4-phosphopantothenoyl-CMP is bound (Fig. 3A), indicating that the archaebacterial PPC synthetase is CTP- and not ATP-dependent. The ATP dependence of the M. jannaschii PPC synthetase was suggested recently because the nucleotide binding motif II contains a Lys residue (Lys310; Fig. 2) that is conserved in eukaryotic ATP-dependent enzymes but not in eubacterial CTP-dependent ones (5Stanitzek S. Augustin M.A. Huber R. Kupke T. Steinbacher S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1977-1988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purified M. jannschii His-CoaC protein was green, and UV-visible spectroscopy showed absorbance maxima characteristic for flavoproteins and, additionally, a stable long-wavelength absorption with a maximum of about 706 nm (Fig. 3B), indicating the formation of a chargetransfer complex between wild-type enzyme and either the substrate PPC or the reaction product PP or with the oxidatively decarboxylated enethiolate intermediate (9Strauss E. Zhai H. Brand L.A. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15520-15533Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The flavin cofactor was identified by RPC as flavin mononucleotide (data not shown). Exchanging of the conserved His87 residue to Ala led to reduced flavin binding capacity (data not shown), indicating that in this case greater structural changes were introduced. His-CoaC H87N was also purified as a green enzyme; however, the long-wavelength absorption band is not stable and is no longer visible after a few hours (Fig. 3B). The absorbance maximum of the flavin cofactor is at 448 nm for the wt enzyme and at 453 nm for the mutant enzyme H87N. From the published crystal structures of PPC decarboxylases and LanD enzymes (8Steinbacher S. Hernández-Acosta P. Bieseler B. Blaesse M. Huber R. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. Kupke T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Albert A.

Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1414-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we know that the conserved His residue of HFCD (homo-oligomeric flavin-dependent Cys decarboxylases) enzymes is in direct neighborhood of the flavin cofactor. Therefore, it is not surprising that exchanging His87 led to changes in the UV-visible spectrum of the bound cofactor. Because His87 is part of the active site and proposed to be involved in substrate binding, it is also not surprising that the charge-transfer band is not as stable as in the wt enzyme. Enzymes known to catalyze the decarboxylation of cysteine residues are trimeric (for example the PPC decarboxylase AtHAL3a (8Steinbacher S. Hernández-Acosta P. Bieseler B. Blaesse M. Huber R.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). M. jannaschii His-CoaC eluted at an apparent molecular mass of ∼242 kDa from the gel filtration column (Fig. 3D). The calculated molecular mass of His-CoaC-FMN is 24.06 kDa. Although the observed molecular mass deviates by 46.8 kDa from the theoretical value for a homododecamer, we assume (taking the inaccuracy of molecular weight determinations by gel filtration into account) that His-CoaC builds up homododecamers. In conclusion, the M. jannaschii Dfp protein is a also a homododecameric enzyme, with the CoaC domain forming a dodecameric core structure as has recently been modeled for the E. coli enzyme (20Manoj N. Strauss E. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 927-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Identification and Characterization of the PPC Synthetase Activity of M. jannaschii—To analyze the biochemistry of the 4′-phosphopantetheine synthesizing activity of M. jannaschii Dfp, it is useful to separate PPC synthetase and PPC decarboxylase activities by separating the bifunctional Dfp protein into CoaB and CoaC. Using the published high pressure liquid chromatography method for the detection of PPC (13Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we were able to show that His-CoaB synthesizes PPC from 4′-phosphopantothenate and cysteine in the presence of CTP (Fig. 4); 4′-phosphopantothenate was enzymatically synthesized in situ using E. coli CoaA. We could not observe any synthetase activity if CTP was omitted in the assay, indicating that ATP (which is always present as cofactor of the pantothenate kinase activity CoaA) is not the cofactor of the Methanocaldococcus enzyme, thus confirming the results described above. The PPC synthetase activity of His-CoaB was further confirmed in a coupled enzyme assay in which synthesized PPC was first decarboxylated to PP and then ligated with AMP to dephospho-CoA (Figs. 5 and 6). The mutant enzyme His-CoaB N217H had only residual PPC synthetase activity, and His-CoaB K310Q had very low activity (Fig. 5). From the crystal structure of E. coli His-CoaB we know that these residues are active site residues (compare also Fig. 2) (5Stanitzek S. Augustin M.A. Huber R. Kupke T. Steinbacher S. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1977-1988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5The enzymatic activity of mutant M. jannaschii His-CoaB proteins. The activity of His-CoaB wt (A), His-CoaB N217H (B), and His-CoaB K310Q (C) was determined at 37 °C by adding the enzymes to a reaction mixture containing pantothenate, ATP, CTP, Mg2+, cysteine, dithiothreitol, His-CoaA (E. coli), His-CoaC (M. jannaschii), and MBP-AtCoaD, separating the reaction products by RPC, and monitoring the absorbance at 214 nm (not shown), 260 nm, and 280 nm (not shown); synthetic dephospho-CoA (D) was used as the reference substance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6The importance of residues His87 and His139 for PPC decarboxylase activity.

In control experiments, either His-CoaC or His-CoaB was omitted.

Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1414-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both residues are not present in M. jannaschii His-CoaC, and therefore we did not expect PPC decarboxylase activity. However, when His-CoaC was added to the PPC synthetase assay and the reaction mixture separated by RPC, we observed that synthesized PPC was partially converted to a substance that was identified by its retention time as 4′-phosphopantetheine (Fig. 4) (13Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To verify these data in a second assay, synthesized 4′-phosphopantetheine was converted to dephospho-CoA by adding a 4′-phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase to the assay (Figs. 5 and 6). These experiments clearly showed that His-CoaC is active in decarboxylating PPC. Active Site Residues of the PPC Decarboxylase Domain of M. jannaschii Dfp—To characterize the PPC decarboxylase domain in more detail, the activity of several mutant enzymes was investigated. All mutants bind the flavin cofactor (however, for the H87A mutant see above) and showed charge-transfer bands indicating that no major structural changes were introduced by the amino acid exchanges. As expected, exchanging the active site residue His87 for Asn reduced the activity of M. jannaschii His-CoaC (Fig. 6). However, the PPC decarboxylases from E. coli and A. thaliana were completely inactivated by exchanging the active site His residue for Asn (13Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Exchanging His139 for Asn and restoring the PXMNXXMW motif drastically reduced the decarboxylase activity rather than increasing it as had been expected. Exchanging His 139for Asp led to a significant change in the UV-visible spectrum of the CoaC enzyme and to significant decrease in enzymatic activity (Fig. 7). The absorbance maximum of the charge-transfer band was shifted by about 100 nm to lower wavelengths (Fig. 3C), indicating a change in the mode of substrate binding. It is possible that to some extent an Asp residue in position 139 is also present in the H139N mutant, derived by deamidation from Asn at higher temperatures (explaining the low activity of the H139N mutant?). Exchange of Asn141 (which is not conserved in PPC decarboxylases) for Asp also led to a significant shift of the charge-transfer band (Fig. 3C) but no decrease in activity was observed (Fig. 7). Surprisingly, exchanging His139 for Ala had no significant impact on activity. By accident, a second mutation (E168K) occurred in one of the H139A clones, and this mutant enzyme, His-CoaC H139A/E168K, had drastically reduced PPC decarboxylase activity (Fig. 6); the residue Glu168 is within the proposed PPC recognition clamp of M. jannaschii His-CoaC. To investigate the role of the residue Glu168 in more detail, we investigated the PPC decarboxylase activities of the mutant proteins His-CoaC E168A, His-CoaC E168D, and His-CoaC E168K (Fig. 7). We observed only residual activity for the mutant E168K, drastically reduced activity for E168A, and a significantly decreased activity for E168D. Exchange of the neighboring Glu167 for Ala did not influence the PPC decarboxylase activity. Because the active site cysteine residue conserved in eubacterial and eukaryotic PPC decarboxylases is not present in the substrate binding clamp of the M. jannaschii CoaC domain, we analyzed whether one of the four cysteine residues of CoaC is essential for activity. However, the activity of the mutant enzymes His-CoaC C54A, His-CoaC C73A, His-CoaC C94A, and His-CoaC C96A was comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). At the moment it is not clear whether Glu168 of the substrate binding clamp takes over the role of the Cys residue as active site acid (in this case an increased apparent pKa value has to be assumed for Glu168). Conclusions—The biosynthetic pathway of 4′-phosphopantetheine from 4′-phosphopantothenate has now been elucidated in eubacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes. The active site architecture of the archaebacterial CoaC domain differs significantly from that of eubacterial and eukaryotic enzymes. The conserved Asn residue of the PXMNXXMW motif is exchanged for His, and the active site Cys residue of the substrate recognition clamp is not present. Crystal structural analysis of M. jannaschii CoaC will be useful to elucidate the reaction mechanism of archaebacterial PPC decarboxylases.

https://openalex.org/W2158438551,"We developed a ligand-mimetic antibody Fab fragment specific for <i>Drosophila</i> αPS2βPS integrins to probe the ligand binding affinities of these invertebrate receptors. TWOW-1 was constructed by inserting a fragment of the extracellular matrix protein Tiggrin into the H-CDR3 of the αvβ3 ligand-mimetic antibody WOW-1. The specificity of αPS2βPS binding to TWOW-1 was demonstrated by numerous tests used for other integrin-ligand interactions. Binding was decreased in the presence of EDTA or RGD peptides and by mutation of the TWOW-1 RGD sequence or the βPS metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif. TWOW-1 binding was increased by mutations in the αPS2 membrane-proximal cytoplasmic GFFNR sequence or by exposure to Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Although Mn<sup>2+</sup> is sometimes assumed to promote maximal integrin activity, TWOW-1 binding in Mn<sup>2+</sup> could be increased further by the αPS2 GFFNR → GFANA mutation. A mutation in the βPS I domain (βPS-b58; V409D) greatly increased ligand binding affinity, explaining the increased cell spreading mediated by αPS2βPS-b58. Further mutagenesis of this residue suggested that Val-409 normally stabilizes the closed head conformation. Mutations that potentially reduce interaction of the integrin β subunit plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) and stalk domains have been shown to have activating properties. We found that complete deletion of the βPS PSI domain enhanced TWOW-1 binding. Moreover the PSI domain is dispensable for at least some other integrin functions because βPS-ΔPSI displayed an enhanced ability to mediate cell spreading. These studies establish a means to evaluate mechanisms and consequences of integrin affinity modulation in a tractable model genetic system."

In this study, we constructed transgenic Nihon rats with introduction of a wild-type Bhd gene to ascertain whether suppression of the Nihon phenotype is possible. Rescue from embryonic lethality of mutant homozygotes (Nihon/Nihon) and suppression of renal carcinogenesis in heterozygotes (Nihon/+) were both observed, defining the germline Bhd mutation in the Nihon rat as an embryonal lethal and tumor predisposing mutation. This transgenic rescue system will be useful to analyse Bhd gene function, its relation to tumorigenesis in vivo, and genetic–environmental interactions in carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2153036373,"The effect of exercise on beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) trafficking was investigated in rat adipocytes. The binding sites of a hydrophilic ligand, [(3)H]CGP12177, increased immediately (0 h) and at 3 h after exercise (3 h) but decreased at 24 h after exercise (24 h). The data of immunoblotting revealed that the alterations in the binding sites mainly paralleled the alterations in the beta2-AR proteins in membrane fractions. The protein expressions of both G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-2 and beta-arrestin-2 were reduced, with a decline in beta2-AR ubiquitination at 0 h and 3 h. The protein expressions of beta2-AR, GRK-2, beta-arrestin-2, the beta2-AR/beta-arrestin-2 complex, and beta2-AR ubiquitination returned to their respective control levels at 24 h, whereas the beta2-AR mRNA level was reduced. Administration of either lactacystin or propranolol did not alter GRK-2 and beta2-AR protein expressions after exercise. Thus, the mechanism underlying the increased density of beta2-AR up to at least 3 h may involve alterations in a multistep event involving the coordinate interaction among proteins mediating beta2-AR trafficking, in which both the receptor-agonist interactions and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway have a key role. However, the decreased protein expression of beta2-AR at 24 h might be due to some change occurring at the translational levels."
