Consequently, we have developed native elongating transcript sequencing technology for mammalian chromatin (mNET-seq), which generates single-nucleotide resolution, nascent transcription profiles. Nascent RNA was detected in the active site of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) along with associated RNA processing intermediates. In particular, we detected 5′splice site cleavage by the spliceosome, showing that cleaved upstream exon transcripts are associated with Pol II CTD phosphorylated on the serine 5 position (S5P), which is accumulated over downstream exons. Also, depletion of termination factors substantially reduces Pol II pausing at gene ends, leading to termination defects. Notably, termination factors play an additional promoter role by restricting non-productive RNA synthesis in a Pol II CTD S2P-specific manner. Our results suggest that CTD phosphorylation patterns established for yeast transcription are significantly different in mammals. Taken together, mNET-seq provides dynamic and detailed snapshots of the complex events underlying transcription in mammals. Transcription is a highly dynamic process.

Our results suggest that CTD phosphorylation patterns established for yeast transcription are significantly different in mammals. Taken together, mNET-seq provides dynamic and detailed snapshots of the complex events underlying transcription in mammals. Virtually all transcripts synthesized by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) from protein-coding genes are co-transcriptionally processed to generate the final functional mRNA (Moore and Proudfoot, 2009Moore M.J. Proudfoot N.J. Pre-mRNA processing reaches back to transcription and ahead to translation.Cell. 2009; 136: 688-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). First, a Cap structure (me7Gppp) is added to the transcript 5′ end soon after transcriptional initiation, which ultimately earmarks transcripts for efficient cytoplasmic translation. Then as the polymerase proceeds to elongate through the gene body (GB), intronic RNA, which often constitutes the majority of the primary transcript in mammalian genes, is removed by a splicing mechanism involving the stepwise assembly of a complex set of small RNA (snRNA) and associated proteins that together make up the spliceosome (Wahl et al., 2009Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. The spliceosome: design principles of a dynamic RNP machine.Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar). In outline, U1snRNA-protein complex (U1snRNP) identifies the intron 5′ splice site (SS) as soon as it is transcribed by Pol II, and then on reaching the 3′ end of the intron multiple snRNPs, U2, U4, U5, and U6 recognize the 3′SS and proximal intronic branch point on the nascent transcript. Following reorganization of snRNP/intron interactions, the branch point A nucleotide carries out a 2′OH nucleophilic attack on the 5′SS, resulting in cleavage of the intron from the upstream exon. The newly formed upstream exon 3′OH then undergoes a second nucleophilic attack on the 3′SS, resulting in precise fusion of adjacent exons and release of the intron. Prior to intron splicing, hairpin structures embedded within some introns are excised by the double-strand RNA-specific microprocessor complex. This comprises an RNA-binding protein DGCR8 together with the endonuclease Drosha, which facilitate release of pre-microRNA (miRNA) hairpins from the nascent transcript. These pre-miRNA go on to form cytoplasmic miRNA, which are critical for the translational regulation of many mRNA (Krol et al., 2010Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). Finally at gene 3′ ends, a further RNA-processing reaction involving cleavage of the nascent transcript at a specific poly(A) signal (PAS) occurs. This RNA cleavage reaction is mediated by an endonuclease (CPSF73) that is part of a large multimeric cleavage and polyadenylation complex. A poly(A) tail is then added to the mRNA 3′ end, promoting rapid release of mRNA from the chromatin template (Proudfoot, 2011Proudfoot N.J. Ending the message: poly(A) signals then and now.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1770-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Although these individual RNA-processing mechanisms are well characterized, their interconnections with transcription remain enigmatic. We describe in this study a method to investigate these interconnections, genome wide. The above outlined co-transcriptional pre-mRNA-processing reactions are precisely coordinated with the Pol II transcription cycle that proceeds from initiation at the transcription start site (TSS), leading on to elongation through the GB and ending with release of the mRNA at the PAS, also called the transcription end site (TES). Finally, termination occurs whereby Pol II separates from the DNA template. Both the Pol II transcription cycle and coupled pre-mRNA-processing reactions are orchestrated by a unique structural feature of Pol II. This comprises an extended C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit (Rpb1) that has a heptad structure YSPTSPS repeated 52 times with some variation in mammals and 26 times in budding yeast. This CTD is separate from the main globular enzyme, being positioned close to the RNA exit channel. It is relatively unstructured (Meinhart and Cramer, 2004Meinhart A. Cramer P. Recognition of RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain by 3′-RNA-processing factors.Nature. 2004; 430: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and subject to extensive post-translational modification, especially phosphorylation of S2 and S5 but also Y1, T4, and S7 (Heidemann et al., 2013Heidemann M.

Acta. 2013; 1829: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Hsin and Manley, 2012Hsin J.P. Manley J.L. The RNA polymerase II CTD coordinates transcription and RNA processing.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 2119-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This combined but differential CTD phosphorylation is often considered to be a molecular code that acts to orchestrate transcription and coupled pre-mRNA processing. Especially in simpler eukaryotes, such as budding yeast, CTD S5P is correlated with TSS-associated events, whereas S2P is thought to correlate with TES events (Buratowski, 2009Buratowski S. Progression through the RNA polymerase II CTD cycle.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 541-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). However in the larger and more complex genes of mammals, this CTD code may be less clear-cut and vary between different gene classes. To gain a more complete understanding of the Pol II transcription cycle and how this is coordinated with co-transcriptional pre-mRNA processing, genome-wide analysis of nascent RNA has been undertaken. For example, global nuclear run on-sequencing (GRO-seq) and precision nuclear run on-sequencing (PRO-seq) with modified nucleotides (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation at human promoters.Science. 2008; 322: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, Kwak et al., 2013Kwak H. Fuda N.J. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Precise maps of RNA polymerase reveal how promoters direct initiation and pausing.Science. 2013; 339: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) provide a way to study Pol II profiles associated with nascent transcription. Similarly, 5′ capped nascent RNA isolated from insoluble chromatin can be sequenced at high resolution (3′NT-seq) (Weber et al., 2014Weber C.M. Ramachandran S. Henikoff S. Nucleosomes are context-specific, H2A.Z-modulated barriers to RNA polymerase.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These approaches generated detailed maps of Pol II nascent transcription in mammals and flies, which accumulates at promoters, providing a regulated transition from initiation into productive elongation (Adelman and Lis, 2012Adelman K.

Young R.A. c-Myc regulates transcriptional pause release.Cell. 2010; 141: 432-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Precise maps of PRO-seq reads identified two different types of Pol II pausing at the TSS, referred to as proximal and distal TSS pausing. PRO-seq additionally showed Pol II accumulation near 3′SS, possibly important for the selection of active exons (Kwak et al., 2013Kwak H. Fuda N.J. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Precise maps of RNA polymerase reveal how promoters direct initiation and pausing.Science. 2013; 339: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). GRO-seq has also shown a correlation between Pol II density and nucleosome occupancy as observed at the TES of many genes, suggesting a connection with transcription termination (Grosso et al., 2012Grosso A.R. de Almeida S.F. Braga J. Carmo-Fonseca M. Dynamic transitions in RNA polymerase II density profiles during transcription termination.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A significant limitation to these above nascent RNA-mapping techniques is that the relationship between Pol II CTD modification and nascent RNA was not established. Precise maps of Pol II nascent RNA have also been generated by native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in yeast (Churchman and Weissman, 2011Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription at nucleotide resolution.Nature. 2011; 469: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Here, endogenous Pol II is flag tagged by genomic integration allowing immunoprecipitation (IP) of Pol II nascent RNA complexes. However, again connections between Pol II CTD modifications and nascent RNA could not be determined. In contrast, we establish mammalian NET-seq technology (mNET-seq) using a selection of CTD phosphorylation-specific Pol II antibodies to IP Pol II-associated transcripts. In detail, we have compared low or unphosphorylated (unph), S2P, S5P, and total (unph+ph) CTD mNET-seq profiles and show that unph CTD Pol II-nascent RNA are accumulated over the TSS, whereas S2P Pol II-nascent RNA are spread throughout the GB and TES. Remarkably S5P profiles precisely correlate with active splicing on protein-coding genes. An important feature of our analysis is that we are able to directly detect the initial 5′SS cleavage step in intron splicing and can also observe active Drosha cleavage of pre-miRNA hairpin structures present in gene introns. In effect, our extensive mNET-seq data sets provide a “treasure trove” of detailed information on nascent transcription and co-transcriptional RNA processing in mammalian cells. To detect unstable nascent RNA across the human genome, we isolated a nuclear chromatin fraction from HeLa cells enriched in transcriptionally active Pol II (Pol IIo) and associated nascent RNA (Figure 1A) (Nojima et al., 2013Nojima T. Dienstbier M. Murphy S. Proudfoot N.J. Dye M.J. Definition of RNA polymerase II CoTC terminator elements in the human genome.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 1080-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This chromatin-bound RNA was fragmented to 150–200 nt and ligated to adaptors for strand-specific paired-end deep sequencing (Figure S1A, top; Experimental Procedures). ChrRNA-seq detects unstable RNA, such as promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), introns, and read-through transcripts (Figures 1D and S1B). For mNET-seq, chromatin was digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to release Pol II from insoluble chromatin. Note that accessible RNA will also be digested (Figure S1A, bottom; Experimental Procedures). Western blot analysis using Pol II 8WG16 antibody confirmed that both phosphorylated (Pol IIo) and unphosphorylated (Pol IIa) forms were released in a MNase dose-dependent manner (Figure 1B). Nascent RNA distribution was also tested after cell fractionation and MNase digestion, by using nuclear run on (NRO) nuclei, labeled with [α-32P] UTP (Figure 1C). The nucleoplasmic (Np) fraction contained long 32P-RNA (over 600 nt). However, after MNase digestion (40 U/μl), the residual chromatin pellet (P) contained RNA of 10–600 nt, whereas the chromatin supernatant (S) had shorter RNA of 10–200 nt. This supernatant fraction was then IPed using Pol II 8WG16 antibody, which efficiently precipitated this shorter RNA. Although the predominant size of the IPed RNA was 20–45 nt, we selected a longer RNA fraction (35–100 nt) to obtain unique alignment with the human genome after deep sequencing. In this method, the Pol II complex will protect nascent RNA from MNase digestion. The hydroxylated 3′ end (3′OH) of the nascent RNA corresponds to the terminal nucleotide synthesized by Pol II (Figure 1A, asterisk). The 5′ end of the cleaved Pol II-associated RNA is also hydroxylated after MNase digestion. To achieve strand-specific RNA sequencing, we carried out a kinase reaction on the IP beads to phosphorylate all nascent RNA 5′ ends but leave the Pol II-embedded 3′OH intact (Figure S1A). Illumina adapters were then ligated onto gel-purified RNA, and Illumina high-throughput paired-end sequencing was carried out and generated ∼108 reads for each mNET-seq sample. For library construction, we omitted the NRO step because the NRO reaction may perturb the native Pol II distribution. The above Pol II IP from MNase-treated chromatin coupled with isolation and sequencing of the associated RNA constitutes a refined mammalian NET-seq protocol.Figure S1Detailed ChrRNA-Seq and mNET-Seq Methods, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) (Above) ChrRNA-seq method.

ENCODE Project ConsortiumAn integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11030) Google Scholar). Finally, libraries were prepared from two biological replicates of HeLa native chromatin after Pol II 8WG16 IP. Deep sequencing was conducted using a reverse sequence primer to read the 3′ ends of the RNA insert, which corresponds to the RNA synthesis site in the Pol II active site (Figure 1A). mNET-seq data aligned to the human genome (hg19) was compared to 8WG16 chromatin IP (ChIP-seq) and ChrRNA-seq as shown for ATP5G1, a typical example of an actively expressed gene in HeLa cells (Figure 1D). A lower-resolution cluster of genes expressed at varying levels is also presented (Figure S1B). Note that as mNET-seq identifies the 3′ end of transcript within the Pol II active site, TSS-associated reads will only be detected 30 nt or beyond the exact TSS. Modifications of histone H3, H3K4m3 and H3K36m3, reflect active promoters and gene bodies, respectively. Strand-specific transcription activity was revealed by ChrRNA-seq. As expected, both replicates of mNET-seq/8WG16 (unph) display strong peaks at the active TSS, consistent with the previously described ChIP-seq/unph profiles. We therefore predict that this TSS-accumulated mNET-seq signal reflects Pol II pausing. Additionally, mNET-seq data revealed both sense and antisense transcription on active genes, as previously shown by GRO-seq and PRO-seq (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation at human promoters.Science. 2008; 322: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, Kwak et al., 2013Kwak H. Fuda N.J. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Precise maps of RNA polymerase reveal how promoters direct initiation and pausing.Science. 2013; 339: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A major benefit of our mNET-seq procedure is that it allows the use of different Pol II antibodies to precipitate modified Pol II-associated nascent transcripts. We elected to employ newly described specific monoclonal antibodies to detect CTD phosphorylation-dependent nascent RNA profiles for S2P, S5P, and all CTD isoforms (Figure 2A) (Stasevich et al., 2014Stasevich T.J. Hayashi-Takanaka Y. Sato Y. Maehara K. Ohkawa Y. Sakata-Sogawa K. Tokunaga M. Nagase T. Nozaki N. McNally J.G. Kimura H. Regulation of RNA polymerase II activation by histone acetylation in single living cells.Nature. 2014; 516: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We carried out further tests to confirm the specificity of these antibodies versus 8WG16. First we performed ELISA assays (Figure S2A) with synthetic peptides of 15 amino acids, containing two adjacent heptad repeats, either singly or doubly phosphorylated on S2P, S5P, and S7P. As expected, 8WG16 bound with relative specificity to unphosphorylated or singly phosphorylated CTD peptides. CMA601 bound all CTD peptides with or without serine phosphorylation, whereas CMA602 and CMA603 bound CTD peptides containing S2P and S5P, respectively. We also performed IP Pol II western blots (Figure S2B) with these four antibodies under mNET-seq conditions and confirmed their specificity and IP efficiency. We finally performed Pol II ChIP analysis on three specific genes comparing our monoclonal antibodies to commercial polyclonal antibodies (ab5095 [S2P] and ab5131 [S5P], respectively) that are widely used for ChIP-seq assays (Pérez-Lluch et al., 2011Pérez-Lluch S. Blanco E. Carbonell A. Raha D. Snyder M. Serras F. Corominas M. Genome-wide chromatin occupancy analysis reveals a role for ASH2 in transcriptional pausing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 4628-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Figure S2C). Notably, matching ChIP profiles were observed for the different S2P- and S5P-specific antibodies. A potential concern with our mNET-seq protocol was that, as we only partially solubilize the chromatin pellet by MNase treatment, there may be selective release of different Pol II modifications. However, the chromatin pellet and supernatant following MNase treatment gave very similar patterns of Pol IIo and Pol IIa with all four antibodies arguing against selective release of differentially modified Pol II (Figure 2B).Figure S2Specificity of Pol II Antibodies, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) ELISA assay (right) was performed with indicated CTD heptapeptides (left) and Pol II antibodies (right).(B) Pol II precipitated from cell extracts with indicated antibodies detected by western blot using each antibody.(C) Pol II ChIP was conducted with indicated Pol II antibodies on GAPDH, IST1, and MYC.

Imhof A. Almouzni G. Mislocalization of the centromeric histone variant CenH3/CENP-A in human cells depends on the chaperone DAXX.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 631-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we found 11,560 (45%) RefSeq genes actively transcribed in HeLa cells. However, to avoid over-represention of ncRNA (such as rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA, and snRNA) in the mNET-seq meta-analysis, we excluded genes overlapping these sequences. We also excluded overlapping transcription units as these might bias average profiles (see Extended Experimental Procedures). We initially looked at meta-profiles over TSS and TES regions for all Pol II isoforms (unph+ph antibody). As expected, bidirectional TSS mNET-seq peaks were detected and a wider, mainly sense peak beyond the TES. In contrast, the histone genes gave a flatter mNET-seq profile across these short poly(A) minus genes and diminished TSS antisense reads (Figure 2C). This clearly shows the specificity of our mNET-seq profiles. We next analyzed meta-profiles using the CTD phospho-specific Pol II antibodies (Figure 2D). To allow cross-comparison between the different antibodies, the data are presented as a ratio with mNET-seq reads obtained for total Pol II (unph+ph). Remarkably, only mNET-seq/unph gave a bidirectional TSS profile, whereas S2P and S5P show a gradual increase from low TSS signals to higher signals in the GB. The TES meta-profiles revealed the expected dominance of S2P. Single-gene TSS and TES mNET-seq profiles (TARDBP and CDK1, respectively) were consistent with the meta-profiles. The marked differences in mNET-seq profiles observed for specific CTD phosphorylation were not seen for histone genes, which showed little difference other than higher unph reads across the genes (Figure S2D). Overall, mNET-seq profiles reveal remarkable CTD phosphorylation specificity for poly(A)+ protein-coding genes. The coupling of Pol II transcription to splicing is well established (Moore and Proudfoot, 2009Moore M.J. Proudfoot N.J. Pre-mRNA processing reaches back to transcription and ahead to translation.Cell. 2009; 136: 688-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). For example, altered Pol II elongation speed can affect alternative splicing patterns (Ip et al., 2011Ip J.Y. Schmidt D. Pan Q. Ramani A.K. Fraser A.G. Odom D.T. Blencowe B.J. Global impact of RNA polymerase II elongation inhibition on alternative splicing regulation.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, Muñoz et al., 2009Muñoz M.J.

Lozano J.J. et al.DNA damage regulates alternative splicing through inhibition of RNA polymerase II elongation.Cell. 2009; 137: 708-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), indicating that Pol II slows down near splice sites to promote spliceosome assembly. In particular, genome-wide analysis of nascent RNA by high-resolution tiling arrays in yeast showed that Pol II is paused over terminal exons but only for co-transcriptionally spliced genes (Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010Carrillo Oesterreich F. Preibisch S. Neugebauer K.M. Global analysis of nascent RNA reveals transcriptional pausing in terminal exons.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Additionally, precisely timed ChIP analysis in yeast revealed that Pol II CTD S5P accumulates over the 3′SS of intron-containing genes (Alexander et al., 2010Alexander R.D. Innocente S.A. Barrass J.D. Beggs J.D. Splicing-dependent RNA polymerase pausing in yeast.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 582-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this splicing-dependent Pol II pausing requires pre-spliceosome assembly (Chathoth et al., 2014Chathoth K.T. Barrass J.D. Webb S. Beggs J.D. A splicing-dependent transcriptional checkpoint associated with prespliceosome formation.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We were interested to determine whether our mNET-seq profiles reflect the co-transcriptionality of splicing, but we observed unexpected patterns. First, we present the mNET-seq profile of a specific gene, TARS, comparing the four different Pol II antibody profiles (Figure 3A). Surprisingly, mNET-seq/S5P selectively detected prominent exon peaks. We have reasoned that mNET-seq will specifically identify the nascent transcript 3′OH in the Pol II active site. However, as previously noted (Churchman and Weissman, 2011Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription at nucleotide resolution.Nature. 2011; 469: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), co-pr"
https://openalex.org/W2119097398,"How disease-associated mutations impair protein activities in the context of biological networks remains mostly undetermined. Although a few renowned alleles are well characterized, functional information is missing for over 100,000 disease-associated variants. Here we functionally profile several thousand missense mutations across a spectrum of Mendelian disorders using various interaction assays. The majority of disease-associated alleles exhibit wild-type chaperone binding profiles, suggesting they preserve protein folding or stability. While common variants from healthy individuals rarely affect interactions, two-thirds of disease-associated alleles perturb protein-protein interactions, with half corresponding to ""edgetic"" alleles affecting only a subset of interactions while leaving most other interactions unperturbed. With transcription factors, many alleles that leave protein-protein interactions intact affect DNA binding. Different mutations in the same gene leading to different interaction profiles often result in distinct disease phenotypes. Thus disease-associated alleles that perturb distinct protein activities rather than grossly affecting folding and stability are relatively widespread."
https://openalex.org/W2037429489,"Major features of transcription by human RNA polymerase II (Pol II) remain poorly defined due to a lack of quantitative approaches for visualizing Pol II progress at nucleotide resolution. We developed a simple and powerful approach for performing native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in human cells that globally maps strand-specific Pol II density at nucleotide resolution. NET-seq exposes a mode of antisense transcription that originates downstream and converges on transcription from the canonical promoter. Convergent transcription is associated with a distinctive chromatin configuration and is characteristic of lower-expressed genes. Integration of NET-seq with genomic footprinting data reveals stereotypic Pol II pausing coincident with transcription factor occupancy. Finally, exons retained in mature transcripts display Pol II pausing signatures that differ markedly from skipped exons, indicating an intrinsic capacity for Pol II to recognize exons with different processing fates. Together, human NET-seq exposes the topography and regulatory complexity of human gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2092150552,"Understanding how functional lipid domains in live cell membranes are generated has posed a challenge. Here, we show that transbilayer interactions are necessary for the generation of cholesterol-dependent nanoclusters of GPI-anchored proteins mediated by membrane-adjacent dynamic actin filaments. We find that long saturated acyl-chains are required for forming GPI-anchor nanoclusters. Simultaneously, at the inner leaflet, long acyl-chain-containing phosphatidylserine (PS) is necessary for transbilayer coupling. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of asymmetric multicomponent-membrane bilayers in a mixed phase provide evidence that immobilization of long saturated acyl-chain lipids at either leaflet stabilizes cholesterol-dependent transbilayer interactions forming local domains with characteristics similar to a liquid-ordered (lo) phase. This is verified by experiments wherein immobilization of long acyl-chain lipids at one leaflet effects transbilayer interactions of corresponding lipids at the opposite leaflet. This suggests a general mechanism for the generation and stabilization of nanoscale cholesterol-dependent and actin-mediated lipid clusters in live cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1971191097,"Modulation of protein function is used to intervene in cellular processes but is often done indirectly by means of introducing DNA or mRNA encoding the effector protein. Thus far, direct intracellular delivery of proteins has remained challenging. We developed a method termed iTOP, for induced transduction by osmocytosis and propanebetaine, in which a combination of NaCl hypertonicity-induced macropinocytosis and a transduction compound (propanebetaine) induces the highly efficient transduction of proteins into a wide variety of primary cells. We demonstrate that iTOP is a useful tool in systems in which transient cell manipulation drives permanent cellular changes. As an example, we demonstrate that iTOP can mediate the delivery of recombinant Cas9 protein and short guide RNA, driving efficient gene targeting in a non-integrative manner."
https://openalex.org/W2136609330,"Mitochondrial diseases include a group of maternally inherited genetic disorders caused by mutations in mtDNA. In most of these patients, mutated mtDNA coexists with wild-type mtDNA, a situation known as mtDNA heteroplasmy. Here, we report on a strategy toward preventing germline transmission of mitochondrial diseases by inducing mtDNA heteroplasmy shift through the selective elimination of mutated mtDNA. As a proof of concept, we took advantage of NZB/BALB heteroplasmic mice, which contain two mtDNA haplotypes, BALB and NZB, and selectively prevented their germline transmission using either mitochondria-targeted restriction endonucleases or TALENs. In addition, we successfully reduced human mutated mtDNA levels responsible for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHOND), and neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), in mammalian oocytes using mitochondria-targeted TALEN (mito-TALENs). Our approaches represent a potential therapeutic avenue for preventing the transgenerational transmission of human mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in mtDNA. PAPERCLIP."
https://openalex.org/W2148578075,"Cytotoxic brain edema triggered by neuronal swelling is the chief cause of mortality following brain trauma and cerebral infarct. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging to analyze contributions of intracellular ionic changes in brain slices, we find that intense Na+ entry triggers a secondary increase in intracellular Cl− that is required for neuronal swelling and death. Pharmacological and siRNA-mediated knockdown screening identified the ion exchanger SLC26A11 unexpectedly acting as a voltage-gated Cl− channel that is activated upon neuronal depolarization to membrane potentials lower than −20 mV. Blockade of SLC26A11 activity attenuates both neuronal swelling and cell death. Therefore cytotoxic neuronal edema occurs when sufficient Na+ influx and depolarization is followed by Cl− entry via SLC26A11. The resultant NaCl accumulation causes subsequent neuronal swelling leading to neuronal death. These findings shed light on unique elements of volume control in excitable cells and lay the ground for the development of specific treatments for brain edema."
https://openalex.org/W2094271958,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) comprising interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and regulatory loci control development and physiology. Numerous disease-associated mutations have been identified, the vast majority residing in non-coding regions of the genome. As current GRN mapping methods test one TF at a time and require the use of cells harboring the mutation(s) of interest, they are not suitable to identify TFs that bind to wild-type and mutant loci. Here, we use gene-centered yeast one-hybrid (eY1H) assays to interrogate binding of 1,086 human TFs to 246 enhancers, as well as to 109 non-coding disease mutations. We detect both loss and gain of TF interactions with mutant loci that are concordant with target gene expression changes. This work establishes eY1H assays as a powerful addition to the toolkit of mapping human GRNs and for the high-throughput characterization of genomic variants that are rapidly being identified by genome-wide association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2158111037,"A decrease in the abundance and biodiversity of intestinal bacteria within the Firmicutes phylum has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In particular, the anti-inflammatory bacterium Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, member of the Firmicutes phylum and one of the most abundant species in healthy human colon, is underrepresented in the microbiota of IBD patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory properties of F. prausnitzii strain A2-165, the biofilm forming strain HTF-F and the extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM) isolated from strain HTF-F. For this purpose, the immunomodulatory properties of the F. prausnitzii strains and the EPM were studied in vitro using human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Then, the capacity of the F. prausnitzii strains and the EPM of HTF-F to suppress inflammation was assessed in vivo in the mouse dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) colitis model. The F. prausnitzii strains and the EPM had anti-inflammatory effects on the clinical parameters measured in the DSS model but with different efficacy. The immunomodulatory effects of the EPM were mediated through the TLR2-dependent modulation of IL-12 and IL-10 cytokine production in antigen presenting cells, suggesting that it contributes to the anti-inflammatory potency of F. prausnitzii HTF-F. The results show that F. prausnitzii HTF-F and its EPM may have a therapeutic use in IBD."

The structure and morphology of the prepared nanoparticle samples were studied in detail using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements. The whole powder pattern modelling (WPPM) method was applied on XRD data to accurately measure the crystalline domain size and their size distribution. The average crystalline domain diameter was found to be 5.2 nm, with a very narrow size distribution. UV-visible absorbance spectrum was used to calculate the optical energy band gap of the prepared CeO2 nanoparticles. The FT-IR spectrum of prepared CeO2 nanoparticles showed absorption bands at 400 cm(-1) to 450 cm(-1) regime, which correspond to CeO2 stretching vibration. The dielectric constant (εr) and dielectric loss (tan δ) values of sintered CeO2 compact consolidated from prepared nanoparticles were measured at different temperatures in the range from 298 K (room temperature) to 623 K, and at different frequencies from 1 kHz to 1 MHz."
https://openalex.org/W1973565169,"Gestational vitamin A (retinol) deficiency poses a risk for ocular birth defects and blindness. We identified missense mutations in RBP4, encoding serum retinol binding protein, in three families with eye malformations of differing severity, including bilateral anophthalmia. The mutant phenotypes exhibit dominant inheritance, but incomplete penetrance. Maternal transmission significantly increases the probability of phenotypic expression. RBP normally delivers retinol from hepatic stores to peripheral tissues, including the placenta and fetal eye. The disease mutations greatly reduce retinol binding to RBP, yet paradoxically increase the affinity of RBP for its cell surface receptor, STRA6. By occupying STRA6 nonproductively, the dominant-negative proteins disrupt vitamin A delivery from wild-type proteins within the fetus, but also, in the case of maternal transmission, at the placenta. These findings establish a previously uncharacterized mode of maternal inheritance, distinct from imprinting and oocyte-derived mRNA, and define a group of hereditary disorders plausibly modulated by dietary vitamin A."
https://openalex.org/W2071709299,"Variability is ubiquitous in human movement, arising from internal and external noise, inherent biological redundancy, and from the neurophysiological control actions that help regulate movement fluctuations. Increased walking variability can lead to increased energetic cost and/or increased fall risk. Conversely, biological noise may be beneficial, even necessary, to enhance motor performance. Indeed, encouraging more variability actually facilitates greater improvements in some forms of locomotor rehabilitation. Thus, it is critical to identify the fundamental principles humans use to regulate stride-to-stride fluctuations in walking. This study sought to determine how humans regulate stride-to-stride fluctuations in stepping movements during treadmill walking. We developed computational models based on pre-defined goal functions to compare if subjects, from each stride to the next, tried to maintain the same speed as the treadmill, or instead stay in the same position on the treadmill. Both strategies predicted average behaviors empirically indistinguishable from each other and from that of humans. These strategies, however, predicted very different stride-to-stride fluctuation dynamics. Comparisons to experimental data showed that human stepping movements were generally well-predicted by the speed-control model, but not by the position-control model. Human subjects also exhibited no indications they corrected deviations in absolute position only intermittently: i.e., closer to the boundaries of the treadmill. Thus, humans clearly do not adopt a control strategy whose primary goal is to maintain some constant absolute position on the treadmill. Instead, humans appear to regulate their stepping movements in a way most consistent with a strategy whose primary goal is to try to maintain the same speed as the treadmill at each consecutive stride. These findings have important implications both for understanding how biological systems regulate walking in general and for being able to harness these mechanisms to develop more effective rehabilitation interventions to improve locomotor performance."

The setting was New Zealand (NZ) (2.3 million citizens, aged 35+ years) which has detailed individual-level administrative cost data.Of the most feasible interventions, the largest health gains were from (in descending order): (i) mandatory 25% reduction in sodium levels in all processed foods; (ii) the package of interventions performed in the United Kingdom (UK); (iii) mandatory 25% reduction in sodium levels in bread, processed meats and sauces; (iv) media campaign (as per a previous UK one); (v) voluntary food labelling as currently used in NZ; (vi) dietary counselling as currently used in NZ. Even larger health gains came from the more theoretical options of a ""sinking lid"" on the amount of food salt released to the national market to achieve an average adult intake of 2300 mg sodium/day (211,000 QALYs gained, 95% uncertainty interval: 170,000-255,000), and from a salt tax. All the interventions produced net cost savings (except counseling--albeit still cost-effective). Cost savings were especially large with the sinking lid (NZ$ 1.1 billion, US$ 0.7 billion). Also the salt tax would raise revenue (up to NZ$ 452 million/year). Health gain per person was greater for Māori (indigenous population) men and women compared to non-Māori.This study substantially expands on the range of previously modelled salt reduction interventions and suggests that some of these might achieve major health gains and major cost savings (particularly the regulatory interventions). They could also reduce ethnic inequalities in health."

This population-based cohort study aims to estimate risk and case fatality of bloodstream infection among chronic hemodialysis patients.In this population-based cohort study we identified residents with end-stage renal disease in Central and North Jutland, Denmark who had hemodialysis as first renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis patients) during 1995-2010. For each hemodialysis patient, we sampled 19 persons from the general population matched on age, gender, and municipality. Information on positive blood cultures was obtained from regional microbiology databases. All persons were observed from cohort entry until first episode of bloodstream infection, emigration, death, or end of hemodialysis treatment, whichever came first. Incidence-rates and incidence-rate ratios were computed and risk factors for bloodstream infection assessed by Poisson regression. Case fatality was compared by Cox regression.Among 1792 hemodialysis patients and 33 618 matched population controls, we identified 461 and 1126 first episodes of bloodstream infection, respectively. Incidence rates of first episode of bloodstream infection were 13.7 (95% confidence interval (CI), 12.5-15.0) per 100 person-years among hemodialysis patients and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.50-0.56) per 100 person-years among population controls. In hemodialysis patients, the most common causative microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (43.8%) and Escherichia coli (12.6%). The 30-day case fatality was similar among hemodialysis patients and population controls 16% (95% CI, 13%-20%) vs. 18% (95% CI, 15%-20%).Hemodialysis patients have extraordinary high risk of bloodstream infection while short-term case fatality following is similar to that of population controls."
https://openalex.org/W2061131172,"Introduction Physical activity (PA) is important for healthy ageing. Better insight into objectively measured PA levels in older adults is needed, since most previous studies employed self-report measures for PA assessment, which are associated with overestimation of PA. Aim This study aimed to provide insight in objectively measured indoor and outdoor PA of older adults, and in PA differences by frailty levels. Methods Data were collected among non-frail (N = 74) and frail (N = 10) subjects, aged 65 to 89 years. PA, measured for seven days with accelerometers and GPS-devices, was categorized into three levels of intensity (sedentary, light, and moderate-to-vigorous PA). Results Older adults spent most time in sedentary and light PA. Subjects spent 84.7%, 15.1% and 0.2% per day in sedentary, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA respectively. On average, older adults spent 9.8 (SD 23.7) minutes per week in moderate-to-vigorous activity, and 747.0 (SD 389.6) minutes per week in light activity. None of the subjects met the WHO recommendations of 150 weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA. Age-, sex- and health status-adjusted results revealed no differences in PA between non-frail and frail older adults. Subjects spent significantly more sedentary time at home, than not at home. Non-frail subjects spent significantly more time not at home during moderate-to-vigorous activities, than at home. Conclusions Objective assessment of PA in older adults revealed that most PA was of light intensity, and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA was very low. None of the older adults met the World Health Organization recommendations for PA. These levels of MVPA are much lower than generally reported based on self-reported PA. Future studies should employ objective methods, and age specific thresholds for healthy PA levels in older adults are needed. These results emphasize the need for effective strategies for healthy PA levels for the growing proportion of older adults."

https://openalex.org/W2019219416,"Curcumin, a natural compound isolated from the Indian spice ""Haldi"" or ""curry powder"", has been used for centuries as a traditional remedy for many ailments. Recently, the potential use of curcumin in cancer prevention and therapy urges studies to uncover the molecular mechanisms associated with its anti-tumor effects. In the current manuscript, we investigated the mechanism of curcumin-induced apoptosis in upper aerodigestive tract cancer cell lines and showed that curcumin-induced apoptosis is mediated by the modulation of multiple pathways such as induction of p73, and inhibition of p-AKT and Bcl-2. Treatment of cells with curcumin induced both p53 and the related protein p73 in head and neck and lung cancer cell lines. Inactivation of p73 by dominant negative p73 significantly protected cells from curcumin-induced apoptosis, whereas ablation of p53 by shRNA had no effect. Curcumin treatment also strongly inhibited p-AKT and Bcl-2 and overexpression of constitutively active AKT or Bcl-2 significantly inhibited curcumin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that curcumin-induced apoptosis is mediated via activating tumor suppressor p73 and inhibiting p-AKT and Bcl-2."

The analysis is based on an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and discusses characteristic features of event related modes (ERMs) resulting from the decomposition. We identify clear differences in certain ERMs in response to contour vs noncontour Gabor stimuli mainly for response amplitudes peaking around 100 [ms] (called P100) and 200 [ms] (called N200) after stimulus onset, respectively. We observe early P100 and N200 responses at electrodes located in the occipital area of the brain, while late P100 and N200 responses appear at electrodes located in frontal brain areas. Signals at electrodes in central brain areas show bimodal early/late response signatures in certain ERMs. Head topographies clearly localize statistically significant response differences to both stimulus conditions. Our findings provide an independent proof of recent models which suggest that contour integration depends on distributed network activity within the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1965140942,"Alcoholism is a frequent comorbidity following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), even in patients without a previous history of alcohol dependence. Despite this correlational relationship, the extent to which the neurological effects of mTBI contribute to the development of alcoholism is unknown. In this study, we used a rodent blast exposure model to investigate the relationship between mTBI and voluntary alcohol drinking in alcohol naïve rats. We have previously demonstrated in Sprague Dawley rats that blast exposure leads to microstructural abnormalities in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and other brain regions that progress from four to thirty days. The mPFC is a brain region implicated in alcoholism and drug addiction, although the impact of mTBI on drug reward and addiction using controlled models remains largely unexplored. Alcohol naïve Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to a blast model of mTBI (or sham conditions) and then tested in several common measures of voluntary alcohol intake. In a seven-week intermittent two-bottle choice alcohol drinking test, sham and blast exposed rats had comparable levels of alcohol intake. In a short access test session at the conclusion of the two-bottle test, blast rats fell into a bimodal distribution, and among high intake rats, blast treated animals had significantly elevated intake compared to shams. We found no effect of blast when rats were tested for an alcohol deprivation effect or compulsive drinking in a quinine adulteration test. Throughout the experiment, alcohol drinking was modest in both groups, consistent with other studies using Sprague Dawley rats. In conclusion, blast exposure had a minimal impact on overall alcohol intake in Sprague Dawley rats, although intake was increased in a subpopulation of blast animals in a short access session following intermittent access exposure."

In periodontal disease, oral microbes and the host response induce the JE to migrate apically and invade the gingival connective tissue during its transformation to pocket epithelium. Inflammation around the pocket epithelium leads to the resorption of alveolar bone around the tooth and, therefore, to the loss of the periodontal ligament attachment, which is normally responsible for suspending the tooth within the bone (2.Breuss J.M.

Epithelial integrins also participate in the regulation of periodontal inflammation (15.Larjava H. Koivisto L. Häkkinen L. Heino J. Epithelial integrins with special reference to oral epithelia.J. Dent. Res. 2011; 90: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Integrins are cell adhesion receptors that link the extracellular matrix to the cellular cytoskeleton, including fibronectin and collagens (16.Hynes R.O. Integrins: bidirectional, allosteric signaling machines.Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar). Integrin αvβ3 is crucial for bone-resorbing function in periodontal disease (17.Larjava H. Koivisto L. Heino J. Häkkinen L. Integrins in periodontal disease.Exp. Cell Res. 2014; 325: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Integrin αvβ6 is constitutively expressed in human and murine JE, and integrin β6−/− mice develop all of the classic hallmarks of chronic periodontal disease as the initial signs of periodontal disease (18.Ghannad F.

During amelogenesis, ameloblasts undergo dramatic cytoskeletal changes, and RhoA protein levels are up-regulated (19.Xue H. Li Y. Everett E.T. Ryan K. Peng L. Porecha R. Yan Y. Lucchese A.M.

Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 5 (ARHGEF5/TIM) belongs to the Rho-GEF family and has GDP-GTP exchange activity for RhoA (20.Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M.

Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Arhgef5 can strongly activate RhoA and RhoB and stimulate Arhgef5-mediated activation of RhoA in dendritic cell chemotaxis (21.Wang Z. Kumamoto Y. Wang P. Gan X. Lehmann D. Smrcka A.V. Cohn L. Iwasaki A. Li L. Wu D. Regulation of immature dendritic cell migration by RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor Arhgef5.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28599-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, although RhoA and ARHGEF5 are expressed in ameloblasts and JE, the RhoA-ARHGEF5 pathway in amelogenesis and JE formation remains unclear. The objectives of this study were to investigate the mechanism of JE attachment to the tooth surface for the formation of an epithelial barrier against periodontal pathogens in healthy and inflamed periodontal tissues. We also identified epithelial attachment loss using objective measures such as biomarkers in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) after destruction and apical migration of JE. We tested the hypothesis that certain extracellular matrix molecules induce ODAM expression in JE via integrin receptors and that ODAM subsequently triggers cytoskeletal changes of the JE via ARHGEF5-RhoA signaling during dentogingival junction development and regeneration. In addition, we evaluated ODAM protein levels in GCF from periodontitis and peri-implantitis patients for early diagnosis and progress monitoring of periodontal disease. The anti-ODAM antibody was generated in rabbits by immunization with ODAM peptides (22.Lee H.K. Park J.T. Cho Y.S. Bae H.S. Cho M.I. Park J.C.

The GFP-tagged RhoAQ63L (constitutively active RhoA) construct was provided by Dr. Hyun-Man Kim (Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea). Full-length FLAG-tagged Arhgef5, ΔPH (amino acids 1341–1488), and Arhgef5 ΔDH (amino acids 1064–1340) were provided by Dr. Masato Okada (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The pOTB7-Arhgef5 construct was purchased from the Korea Human Gene Bank. FLAG-tagged Arhgef5 ΔSH and SH (amino acids 1489–1581) were subcloned into FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Experimental periodontitis in mice was induced by P. gingivalis (PG) inoculation and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment. Mice were randomly divided into three groups: sham, DSS, and PG. The DSS group received daily application of 5% DSS (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). The PG group received oral inoculation of 109 cells of PG cells in 100 μl of 2% carboxymethylcellulose on days 4, 6, and 8. The sham group received vehicles instead of DSS and PG. All mice were euthanized on day 50. All animal experiments were performed according to the Dental Research Institute guidelines of Seoul National University. Teeth blocks from WT and integrin β3−/− mice were provided by Dr. Toshiyuki Yoshida and Teruo Okano (Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan). Extracted human teeth and associated gingival tissue were obtained from Seoul National University Dental Hospital. These studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects of the Seoul National University (IRB no. S-D20140007). Rat and mouse teeth were decalcified in 10% EDTA (pH 7.4), embedded in paraffin, and processed for immunohistochemistry. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (dilutions of 1:100–1:200). Secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies were added to the sections for 30 min at room temperature, followed by reaction with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Signals were converted using a diaminobenzidine kit (Vector Laboratories). Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Gene expression profile data (GSE2429) were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO) database (accession number GSE10526 to PG SerB mutant infection effect on immortalized gingival epithelial cells, GSE4250 to hereditary gingival fibromatosis, and GSE2255 to integrin β6 deficiency model of emphysema). After informed consent, 14 unrelated, systemically healthy adults were included in the study. This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects of the Korea University Anam Hospital (IRB no. ED13162). Periodontal examination included the assessment of plaque score, probing pocket depth, loss of attachment, and bleeding on probing. For peri-implantitis evaluation, two patients with peri-implantitis were included in the study, and two healthy implants served as control. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (IRB no. B-1410-271-003). Samples were obtained from teeth of one quadrant on the jaw that contained the teeth showing the deepest probing depth and the contralateral quadrant of the opposite jaw. Therefore, a total of 222 samples were collected from 12–16 teeth of each subject. Each tooth site was gently dried for 10 s with compressed air and isolated from saliva with a cotton roll. GCF samples were obtained from four sites of one tooth using absorbent paper strips (Oraflow Inc., Plainview, NY). Paper strips were placed in a single labeled tube containing 100 μl of PBS. The total levels of ODAM in GCF samples were assayed using an ODAM ELISA kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Cusabio Biotech, Wuhan, China). Associations between probing depths and ODAM concentrations in GCF were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis test and SPSS. Ameloblast lineage cells (ALCs) were cultured on collagen-coated dishes in minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 10 ng/ml recombinant human EGF (Sigma-Aldrich), and an antibiotic/antimycotic agent (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HAT7 cells, a dental epithelial cell line originating from a cervical loop epithelium of a rat incisor (a gift from Dr. Harada, Department of Oral Anatomy II, Iwate Medical College School of Dentistry, Morioka, Japan), were grown and maintained in DMEM/F12 (Gibco). RAW264.7 cells, a macrophage-like cell line derived from BALB/c mice, were grown and maintained in DMEM. To induce differentiation, 80–90% confluent cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% FBS, ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml), and β-glycerophosphate (10 mm) for up to 2 weeks. ALC or HAT7 cells were seeded in culture plates. Cells were transiently transfected with reporter constructs using Metafectene PRO reagent (Biontex, Planegg, Martinsried, Germany). In addition, cells were transiently transfected with siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX reagent (Invitrogen). Cell lysates were prepared by adding 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with a 1:200 dilution of the indicated antibody. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Immune complexes were released from the beads by boiling. Following electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. For His pulldown assays, 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with His-ODAM C-terminal protein, followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with a 1:200 dilution of the anti-His antibody. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and immune complexes were released from the beads by boiling. Following electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. Cells were collected by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated by centrifugation. The membrane pellet was resuspended in ice-cold hypertonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 10% glycerol). The soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation. Proteins (30 μg) from the cells were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted in PBS-T buffer (1:1000). After washing, membranes were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies. Labeled protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Dogen, Cambridge, MA). Cells in Laboratory-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing and blocking, Cells were incubated for 1 h with primary (1:200) and Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin antibodies in blocking buffer (PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin), followed by the addition of anti-FITC or Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse, rabbit, or goat IgG antibodies (1:200). After washing, cells were visualized using fluorescence microscopy (AX70, Olympus Optical Co, Tokyo, Japan). Chromosomal DNA in the nucleus was stained using DAPI. GTP-loaded RhoA levels were determined using the RhoA G-LISA Activation Assay Kit (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Equal amounts of proteins from each experimental group were used in G-LISA RhoA activation assays to obtain values for RhoA activity per cell. ALC cells were seeded on slides coated with recombinant ODAM protein (rODAM) or collagen and incubated for 4 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and stained with crystal violet for 10 min, and, finally, the optical density at 595 nm was measured. Thirty healthy upper first molars from 24 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats were used for gingivectomy. Surgical areas were cleaned with 0.5% chlorhexidine. Removal of the gingiva and the JE along the maxillary molars (gingivectomy) was accomplished by scraping or ligature of the tooth surface and extended 2 mm along the palate. All quantitative data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical differences were analyzed using Student's t tests (*, p < 0.05). ODAM was expressed in differentiating ameloblasts as well as in normal and regenerating JE (6.Nishio C. Wazen R. Kuroda S. Moffatt P. Nanci A. Expression pattern of odontogenic ameloblast-associated and amelotin during formation and regeneration of the junctional epithelium.Eur. Cell. Mater. 2010; 20: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23.Park J.C. Park J.T. Son H.H. Kim H.J. Jeong M.J. Lee C.S. Dey R. Cho M.I. The amyloid protein APin is highly expressed during enamel mineralization and maturation in rat incisors.Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2007; 115: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). First, we investigated ODAM protein expression during amelogenesis and JE formation by immunohistochemistry. ODAM was clearly observed in reduced enamel epithelium, maturation-stage ameloblasts, and JE during rat tooth development (Fig. 1A). ODAM expression was reduced in JE after damage by chemical drugs, DSS, and PG compared with the sham group (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether periodontitis affects ODAM expression in human JE, we immunohistochemically evaluated ODAM protein expression in a human tooth extracted because of severe periodontitis. In the extracted tooth, JE transformed to the invasive pocket epithelium. In the pocket epithelium, ODAM was no longer detected (Fig. 1C). ODAM expression decreased significantly in damaged gingival epithelial cells modulated with the oral pathogenic PG compared with normal epithelial cells (Fig. 1D). To confirm the alteration of ODAM expression after inflammation in JE, we analyzed microarray data from the NCBI GEO dataset. Hereditary gingival fibromatosis associated with aggressive periodontitis typically results in severe, rapid destruction of the tooth-supporting apparatus (24.Casavecchia P. Uzel M.I. Kantarci A. Hasturk H. Dibart S. Hart T.C. Trackman P.C. Van Dyke T.E. Hereditary gingival fibromatosis associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis: a case report.J. Periodontol. 2004; 75: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GEO data showed that ODAM expression decreased significantly in gingival tissues with hereditary gingival fibromatosis compared with those of normal patients (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that ODAM was expressed in normal JE of healthy tooth but decreased after inflammation or chemical damage and, consequently, disappeared in the pathologic pocket epithelium of diseased periodontium. ODAM protein was detected in sera from late-stage breast cancer patients (25.Kestler D.P. Foster J.S. Macy S.D. Murphy C.L. Weiss D.T. Solomon A. Expression of odontogenic ameloblast-associated protein (ODAM) in dental and other epithelial neoplasms.Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We found that ODAM was expressed in normal JE. However, its expression disappeared in pathologic pocket epithelium from periodontitis patients. On the basis of these findings, we investigated the expression of ODAM in GCF from periodontitis and peri-implantitis patients by ELISA. As expected, the level of ODAM protein was increased significantly in GCF from periodontitis patients compared with healthy teeth without inflammation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the level of ODAM protein in GCF correlated with the probing depth in periodontitis patients (Fig. 2B). Similar to periodontitis, the ODAM protein level was also increased significantly in GCF from peri-implantitis patients compared with healthy teeth (Fig. 2C) and healthy implants (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that ODAM expression in JE reflects a healthy periodontium. However, after JE attachment loss caused by periodontitis or peri-implantitis, ODAM is extruded from JE and detected in GCF. In our previous study, ARHGEF5 was identified as an ODAM-interacting protein by protoarray analysis (22.Lee H.K. Park J.T. Cho Y.S. Bae H.S. Cho M.I. Park J.C. Odontogenic ameloblasts-associated protein (ODAM), via phosphorylation by bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IB (BMPR-IB), is implicated in ameloblast differentiation.J. Cell. Biochem. 2012; 113: 1754-1765PubMed Google Scholar). In immunoprecipitation (IP) assay, ODAM also showed endogenous interaction with ARHGEF5 in ALCs (Fig. 3A). To confirm whether ODAM could interact with ARHGEF5, ALCs were cotransfected with ARHGEF5and HA-tagged ODAM constructs for IP assay. The results demonstrated the interaction of ODAM with ARHGEF5 (Fig. 3B). IP with the FLAG antibody followed by blotting with the ARHEGF5 antibody indicated that amino acids 127–279 of ODAM affected the interaction between ODAM and ARHGEF5 (Fig. 3C). Pulldown assays also showed a direct interaction between these two proteins (Fig. 3D). Immunofluore"
https://openalex.org/W2011321783,"OBJECTIVES: Meta-analytic evidence based on cross-sectional investigations between posttraumatic growth (PTG) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) demonstrates that the two concepts are positively related and that ethnic minorities report greater PTG. Few longitudinal studies have quantified this relationship so the evidence is limited regarding the potential benefit PTG may have on post-traumatic adjustment and whether differences between ethnic groups exist. METHODS: The current study attempts to fill a substantial gap in the literature by exploring the relationship between PTG and PTSD symptom clusters longitudinally using a nationally representative cohort of 1613 Israelis and Palestinian Citizens of Israel (PCI) interviewed via telephone on three measurement occasions during one year. Latent cross-lagged structural models estimated the relationship between PTG and each PTSD symptom cluster, derived from confirmatory factor analysis, representing latent and statistically invariant PTSD symptom factors, best representing PTSD for both ethnic groups. RESULTS: PTG was not associated with less PTSD symptom severity in any of the four PTSD clusters, for Jews and PCI. In contrast, PTSD symptom severity assessed earlier was related to later reported PTG in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that PTSD symptoms contribute to greater reported PTG, but that PTG does not provide a salutatory benefit by reducing symptoms of PTSD. Language: en"
https://openalex.org/W2077977024,"Typhoid fever remains a public health threat in many countries. A positive result in traditional culture is a gold-standard for typhoid diagnosis, but this method is time consuming and not sensitive enough for detection of samples containing a low copy number of the target organism. The availability of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which offers high speed and simplicity in detection of specific targets, has vastly improved the diagnosis of numerous infectious diseases. However, little research efforts have been made on utilizing this approach for diagnosis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi by targeting a single and specific gene. In this study, a LAMP assay for rapid detection of S. Typhi based on a novel marker gene, termed STY2879-LAMP, was established and evaluated with real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The specificity tests showed that STY2879 could be amplified in all S. Typhi strains isolated in different years and regions in China, whereas no amplification was observable in non-typhoidal strains covering 34 Salmonella serotypes and other pathogens causing febrile illness. The detection limit of STY2879-LAMP for S. Typhi was 15 copies/reaction in reference plasmids, 200 CFU/g with simple heat-treatment of DNA extracted from simulated stool samples and 20 CFU/ml with DNA extracted from simulated blood samples, which was 10 fold more sensitive than the parallel RT-PCR control experiment. Furthermore, the sensitivity of STY2879-LAMP and RT-PCR combining the traditional culture enrichment method for simulated stool and blood spiked with lower S. Typhi count during the 10 h enrichment time was also determined. In comparison with LAMP, the positive reaction time for RT-PCR required additional 2-3 h enrichment time for either simulated stool or blood specimens. Therefore, STY2879-LAMP is of practical value in the clinical settings and has a good potential for application in developing regions due to its easy-to-use protocol."

In poor urban settlements in Bangladesh, BRAC's Manoshi programme trains community health workers (CHWs) to support women through pregnancy, delivery and postpartum periods. This paper test the hypothesis that the introduction of CHWs as weak ties into the social networks of Manoshi members mediates improvements in maternal and neonatal health (MNH) best practices by providing support, facilitating ideational change, connecting mother to resources, and strengthening or countering the influence of strong ties.1000 women who had given birth in the last three months were identified and interviewed as part of ongoing monitoring of 5 poor urban settlements in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A social networks questionnaire was administered which elicited women's perceived networks around pregnancy, delivery and post-partum periods. Mediation analysis was performed to test the hypothesis that penetration of Manoshi CHWs into women's perceived networks has a beneficial effect on MNH best practises.The presence and influence of Manoshi CHWs in women's networks significantly mediated the effect of Manoshi membership on MNH best practices. Respondents who were Manoshi members and who listed Manoshi CHWs as part of their support networks were significantly more likely to deliver with a trained birth attendant (OR 3.61; 95%CI 2.36-5.51), to use postnatal care (OR 3.09; 95%CI 1.83-5.22), and to give colostrum to their newborn (OR 7.51; 95%CI 3.51-16.05).Manoshi has succeeded in penetrating the perceived pregnancy, delivery and post-partum networks of poor urban women through the introduction of trained CHWs. Study findings demonstrate the benefits of moving beyond urban health care delivery models that concentrate on the provision of clinical services by medical providers, to an approach that nurtures the power of social networks as a means to support the poorest and most marginalized in changing behaviour and effectively accessing appropriate maternal services."

https://openalex.org/W2059356924,"The inbred strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J (DBA) display striking differences in a number of behavioral tasks depending on hippocampal function, such as contextual memory. Historically, this has been explained through differences in postsynaptic protein expression underlying synaptic transmission and plasticity. We measured the synaptic hippocampal protein content (iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) and mass spectrometry), CA1 synapse ultrastructural morphology, and synaptic functioning in adult C57BL/6J and DBA mice. DBA mice showed a prominent decrease in the Ras-GAP calcium-sensing protein RASAL1. Furthermore, expression of several presynaptic markers involved in exocytosis, such as syntaxin (Stx1b), Ras-related proteins (Rab3a/c), and rabphilin (Rph3a), was reduced. Ultrastructural analysis of CA1 hippocampal synapses showed a significantly lower number of synaptic vesicles and presynaptic cluster size in DBA mice, without changes in postsynaptic density or active zone. In line with this compromised presynaptic morphological and molecular phenotype in DBA mice, we found significantly lower paired-pulse facilitation and enhanced short term depression of glutamatergic synapses, indicating a difference in transmitter release and/or refilling mechanisms. Taken together, our data suggest that in addition to strain-specific postsynaptic differences, the change in dynamic properties of presynaptic transmitter release may underlie compromised synaptic processing related to cognitive functioning in DBA mice."
https://openalex.org/W2095231589,"Osteoclasts are multinucleated bone degrading cells. Phosphate is an important constituent of mineralized bone and released in significant quantities during bone resorption. Molecular contributors to phosphate transport during the resorptive activity of osteoclasts have been controversially discussed. This study aimed at deciphering the role of sodium-dependent phosphate transporters during osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Our studies reveal RANKL-induced differential expression of sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein IIa (NaPi-IIa) transcript and protein during osteoclast development, but no expression of the closely related NaPi-IIb and NaPi-IIc SLC34 family isoforms. In vitro studies employing NaPi-IIa-deficient osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclasts reveal that NaPi-IIa is dispensable for bone resorption and osteoclast differentiation. These results are supported by the analysis of structural bone parameters by high-resolution microcomputed tomography that yielded no differences between adult NaPi-IIa WT and KO mice. By contrast, both type III sodium-dependent phosphate transporters Pit-1 and Pit-2 were abundantly expressed throughout osteoclast differentiation, indicating that they are the relevant sodium-dependent phosphate transporters in osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors. We conclude that phosphate transporters of the SLC34 family have no role in osteoclast differentiation and function and propose that Pit-dependent phosphate transport could be pivotal for bone resorption and should be addressed in further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2066943074,"The nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a rat lungworm, a zoonotic pathogen that causes human eosinophilic meningitis and ocular angiostrongyliasis characteristic of rat lungworm (RLW) disease. Definitive diagnosis is made by finding and identifying A. cantonensis larvae in the cerebral spinal fluid or by using a custom immunological or molecular test. This study was conducted to determine if genomic DNA from A. cantonensis is detectable by qPCR in the blood or tissues of experimentally infected rats. F1 offspring from wild rats were subjected to experimental infection with RLW larvae isolated from slugs, then blood or tissue samples were collected over multiple time points. Blood samples were collected from 21 rats throughout the course of two trials (15 rats in Trial I, and 6 rats in Trial II). In addition to a control group, each trial had two treatment groups: the rats in the low dose (LD) group were infected by approximately 10 larvae and the rats in the high dose (HD) group were infected with approximately 50 larvae. In Trial I, parasite DNA was detected in cardiac bleed samples from five of five LD rats and five of five HD rats at six weeks post-infection (PI), and three of five LD rats and five of five HD rats from tail tissue. In Trial II, parasite DNA was detected in peripheral blood samples from one of two HD rats at 53 minutes PI, one of two LD rats at 1.5 hours PI, one of two HD rats at 18 hours PI, one of two LD rats at five weeks PI and two of two at six weeks PI, and two of two HD rats at weeks five and six PI. These data demonstrate that parasite DNA can be detected in peripheral blood at various time points throughout RLW infection in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2022271014,"During fetal development, the lung is filled with fluid that is secreted by an active Cl- transport promoting lung growth. The basolateral Na+,K+,2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) participates in Cl- secretion. The apical Cl- channels responsible for secretion are unknown but studies suggest an involvement of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is developmentally regulated with a high expression in early fetal development and a decline in late gestation. Perinatal lung transition is triggered by hormones that stimulate alveolar Na+ channels resulting in fluid absorption. Little is known on how hormones affect pulmonary Cl- channels. Since the rise of fetal cortisol levels correlates with the decrease in fetal CFTR expression, a causal relation may be assumed. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of glucocorticoids on pulmonary Cl- channels. Alveolar cells from fetal and adult rats, A549 cells, bronchial Calu-3 and 16HBE14o- cells, and primary rat airway cells were studied with real-time quantitative PCR and Ussing chambers. In fetal and adult alveolar cells, glucocorticoids strongly reduced Cftr expression and channel activity, which was prevented by mifepristone. In bronchial and primary airway cells CFTR mRNA expression was also reduced, whereas channel activity was increased which was prevented by LY-294002 in Calu-3 cells. Therefore, glucocorticoids strongly reduce CFTR expression while their effect on CFTR activity depends on the physiological function of the cells. Another apical Cl- channel, anoctamin 1 showed a glucocorticoid-induced reduction of mRNA expression in alveolar cells and an increase in bronchial cells. Furthermore, voltage-gated chloride channel 5 and anoctamine 6 mRNA expression were increased in alveolar cells. NKCC1 expression was reduced by glucocorticoids in alveolar and bronchial cells alike. The results demonstrate that glucocorticoids differentially modulate pulmonary Cl- channels and are likely causing the decline of CFTR during late gestation in preparation for perinatal lung transition."
https://openalex.org/W2047918556,"Excessive cytokine inflammatory response due to chronic or superphysiological level of microbial infection during pregnancy leads to pregnancy complications such as early pregnancy defects/loss and preterm birth. Bacterial toxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), long recognized as a potent proinflammatory mediator, has been identified as a risk factor for pregnancy complications. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) isozymes have been shown to detoxify LPS by dephosphorylation. In this study, we examined the role of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in mitigating LPS-induced early pregnancy complications in mice. We found that 1) the uterus prior to implantation and implantation sites following embryo implantation produce LPS recognition and dephosphorylation molecules TLR4 and tissue non-specific AP (TNAP) isozyme, respectively; 2) uterine TNAP isozyme dephosphorylates LPS at its sites of production; 3) while LPS administration following embryo implantation elicits proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels at the embryo implantation sites (EISs) and causes early pregnancy loss, dephosphorylated LPS neither triggers proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels at the EISs nor induces pregnancy complications; 4) AP isozyme supplementation to accelerate LPS detoxification attenuates LPS-induced pregnancy complications following embryo implantation. These findings suggest that a LPS dephosphorylation strategy using AP isozyme may have a unique therapeutic potential to mitigate LPS- or Gram-negative bacteria-induced pregnancy complications in at-risk women."
https://openalex.org/W2046898981,"The aim of the study was to explore the clinical outcome of posterolateral and anteromedial approaches in treatment of terrible triad of the elbow. The study involved 12 patients with closed terrible triad of the elbow treated by posterolateral and anteromedial approaches between January 2010 and June 2012. The mechanism of injury included fall from height in 9 patients and traffic accident in 3. According to O’Driscoll classification for fractures of the ulnar coronoid, there were 11 patients with type Ⅰ and 1 with type Ⅱ fractures. According to Mason classification for fractures of the radial head, there were 3 patients with type Ⅰ, 7 with type Ⅱ and 2 with type Ⅲ fractures. All patients were followed up for 12-27 months (average 15.5 months), which showed no pain or severe pain in all patients except for 2 patients with mild pain. At the last follow-up, the mean flexion was for 125°(range, 90°-140°), the mean extension loss for 20°(range, 0°-70°), the mean pronation for 66°(range, 20°-85°) and the mean supination for 60°(range, 30°-85°). The bony union time was 8-14 weeks (average 11 weeks) and the elbows were stable in flexion-extension and varus-valgus in all patients. The elbows maintained a concentric reduction of both the ulnotrochlear and the radiocapitellar articulation. Mild heterotopic ossification of the elbow occurred in 3 patients at 6 months after operation and mild degenerative change in 1 patient at 18 months after operation. The Broberg and Morrey elbow performance score was 82 points (range, 58-98 points). The results were excellent in 6 patients, good in 4, fair in 1 and poor in 1, with excellence rate of 83.3%. The results showed that the combined posterolateral and anteromedial approaches can facilitate the reduction and fixation of terrible triad of the elbow. Repair of radial head, coronoid, medial and lateral collateral ligaments can sufficiently restore the elbow stability, allow early postoperative motion and enhance the functional recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2014314765,"Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin elicits various immune responses such as the release of cytokines, chemokines, and superoxide via the GM1a/TrkA complex. Alpha-toxin possesses phospholipase C (PLC) hydrolytic activity that contributes to signal transduction in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. Little is known about the relationship between lipid metabolism and TrkA activation by alpha-toxin. Using live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we monitored transbilayer movement of diacylglycerol (DAG) with the yellow fluorescent protein-tagged C1AB domain of protein kinase C-γ (EYFP-C1AB). DAG accumulated at the marginal region of the plasma membrane in alpha toxin-treated A549 cells, which also exhibited GM1a clustering and TrkA phosphorylation. Annexin V binding assays showed that alpha-toxin induced the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, H148G, a variant toxin which binds cell membrane and has no enzymatic activity, did not induce DAG translocation, GM1a clustering, or TrkA phosphorylation. Alpha-toxin also specifically activated endogenous phospholipase Cγ-1 (PLCγ-1), a TrkA adaptor protein, via phosphorylation. U73122, an endogenous PLC inhibitor, and siRNA for PLCγ-1 inhibited the formation of DAG and release of IL-8. GM1a accumulation and TrkA phosphorylation in A549 cells treated with alpha-toxin were also inhibited by U73122. These results suggest that the flip-flop motion of hydrophobic lipids such as DAG leads to the accumulation of GM1a and TrkA. We conclude that the formation of DAG by alpha-toxin itself (first step) and activation of endogenous PLCγ-1 (second step) leads to alterations in membrane dynamics, followed by strong phosphorylation of TrkA."
https://openalex.org/W2091901995,"Background Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a severe complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Previously, it has been shown that infiltrating CD4-positive T cells and M2 macrophages are associated with several fibrotic conditions. Therefore, the characteristics of the peritoneal cell infiltrate in EPS may be of interest to understand EPS pathogenesis. In this study, we aim to elucidate the composition of the peritoneal cell infiltrate in EPS patients and relate the findings to clinical outcome. Study Design, Setting, and Participants We studied peritoneal membrane biopsies of 23 EPS patients and compared them to biopsies of 15 PD patients without EPS. The cellular infiltrate was characterized by immunohistochemistry to detect T cells(CD3-positive), CD4-positive (CD4+) and CD8-positive T cell subsets, B cells(CD20-positive), granulocytes(CD15-positive), macrophages(CD68-positive), M1(CD80-positive), and M2(CD163-positive) macrophages. Tissues were analysed using digital image analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to investigate the survival in the different staining groups. Results The cellular infiltrate in EPS biopsies was dominated by mononuclear cells. For both CD3 and CD68, the median percentage of area stained was higher in biopsies of EPS as opposed to non-EPS patients (p<0.001). EPS biopsies showed a higher percentage of area stained for CD4 (1.29%(0.61-3.20)) compared to CD8 (0.71%(0.46-1.01), p = 0.04), while in the non-EPS group these cells were almost equally represented (respectively 0.28%(0.05-0.83) versus 0.22%(0.17-0.43), p = 0.97). The percentage of area stained for both CD80 and CD163 was higher in EPS than in non-EPS biopsies (p<0.001), with CD163+ cells being the most abundant phenotype. Virtually no CD20-positive and CD15-positive cells were present in biopsies of a subgroup of EPS patients. No relation was found between the composition of the mononuclear cell infiltrate and clinical outcome. Conclusions A characteristic mononuclear cell infiltrate consisting of CD4+ and CD163+ cells dominates the peritoneum of EPS patients. These findings suggest a role for both CD4+ T cells and M2 macrophages in the pathogenesis of EPS."
https://openalex.org/W1994169691,"The emergence and spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) represent a major public health concern because these bacteria are usually extensively resistant to most antibiotics. In order to evaluate their dissemination in Quebec, a surveillance program was introduced in 2010. We report the molecular and epidemiological profiles of CPE isolates collected. Between August 2010 and December 2012, a total of 742 non-duplicate isolates non-susceptible to carbapenems were analysed. AmpC β-lactamase and metallo-β-lactamase production were detected by Etest and carbapenemase production by the modified Hodge test (MHT). Antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined using broth microdilution or Etest. Clonality of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) strains was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The presence of genes encoding carbapenemases as well as other β-lactamases was detected using PCR. Of the 742 isolates tested, 169 (22.8%) were CPE. Of these 169 isolates, 151 (89.3%) harboured a blaKPC gene while the remaining isolates carried blaSME (n = 9), blaOXA-48 (n = 5), blaNDM (n = 3), and blaNMC (n = 1) genes. Among the 93 KPC strains presenting with a unique pattern (unique PFGE pattern and/or unique antibiotics susceptibility profile), 99% were resistant to ertapenem, 95% to imipenem, 87% to meropenem, 97% to aztreonam, 31% to colistin and 2% to tigecycline. In 19 patients, 2 to 5 KPC strains from different species or with a different PFGE pattern were isolated. CPE strains were present in the province of Quebec with the majority of strains harbouring KPC. Alternately, SME, OXA-48 and NMC containing strains were rarely found."

Next, we identified multiple positively charged residues in the inner ring of HUS1 that were crucial for genotoxin-induced 9-1-1 chromatin localization and ATR signaling. Finally, we found two hydrophobic pockets on the HUS1 outer surface that were important for cell survival after DNA damage. Interestingly, these pockets were not required for 9-1-1 chromatin localization or ATR-mediated CHK1 activation but were necessary for interactions between HUS1 and its binding partner MYH, suggesting that they serve as interaction domains for the recruitment and coordination of downstream effectors at damage sites.

https://openalex.org/W2064212955,"Colorectal and prostate cancers are two of the most common types and cause of a high rate of deaths worldwide. Therefore, any strategy to stop or at least slacken the development and progression of malignant cells is an important therapeutic choice. The aim of the present work is the identification of novel cancer chemotherapy agents. Nowadays, many different drug discovery approaches are available, but this paper focuses on Molecular Topology, which has already demonstrated its extraordinary efficacy in this field, particularly in the identification of new hit and lead compounds against cancer. This methodology uses the graph theoretical formalism to numerically characterize molecular structures through the so called topological indices. Once obtained a specific framework, it allows the construction of complex mathematical models that can be used to predict physical, chemical or biological properties of compounds. In addition, Molecular Topology is highly efficient in selecting and designing new hit and lead drugs. According to the aforementioned, Molecular Topology has been applied here for the construction of specific Akt/mTOR and β-catenin inhibition mathematical models in order to identify and select novel antitumor agents.Based on the results obtained by the selected mathematical models, six novel potential inhibitors of the Akt/mTOR and β-catenin pathways were identified. These compounds were then tested in vitro to confirm their biological activity.Five of the selected compounds, CAS n° 256378-54-8 (Inhibitor n°1), 663203-38-1 (Inhibitor n°2), 247079-73-8 (Inhibitor n°3), 689769-86-6 (Inhibitor n°4) and 431925-096 (Inhibitor n°6) gave positive responses and resulted to be active for Akt/mTOR and/or β-catenin inhibition. This study confirms once again the Molecular Topology's reliability and efficacy to find out novel drugs in the field of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2087369889,"Adiponectin, circulating levels of which are reduced in obesity and diabetes, mediates cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in response to pressure overload (PO). Here, we performed a detailed temporal analysis of progressive cardiac ECM remodelling in adiponectin knockout (AdKO) and wild-type (WT) mice at 3 days and 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks following the induction of mild PO via minimally invasive transverse aortic banding. We first observed that myocardial adiponectin gene expression was reduced after 4 weeks of PO, whereas increased adiponectin levels were detected in cardiac homogenates at this time despite decreased circulating levels of adiponectin. Scanning electron microscopy and Masson's trichrome staining showed collagen accumulation increased in response to 2 and 4 weeks of PO in WT mice, while fibrosis in AdKO mice was notably absent after 2 weeks but highly apparent after 4 weeks of PO. Time and intensity of fibroblast appearance after PO was not significantly different between AdKO and WT animals. Gene array analysis indicated that MMP2, TIMP2, collagen 1α1 and collagen 1α3 were induced after 2 weeks of PO in WT but not AdKO mice. After 4 weeks MMP8 was induced in both genotypes, MMP9 only in WT mice and MMP1α only in AdKO mice. Direct stimulation of primary cardiac fibroblasts with adiponectin induced a transient increase in total collagen detected by picrosirius red staining and collagen III levels synthesis, as well as enhanced MMP2 activity detected via gelatin zymography. Adiponectin also enhanced fibroblast migration and attenuated angiotensin-II induced differentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype. In conclusion, these data indicate that increased myocardial bioavailability of adiponectin mediates ECM remodeling following PO and that adiponectin deficiency delays these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2094712461,"Sequences of the genome that are capable of silencing gene expression are thought to play a key role in gene regulation. However, very few silencer elements capable of functioning in mammalian cells have been described, and only a fraction of these have been tested for the ability to function in an autonomous fashion. We report here the characterization and functional validation of a constitutive autonomous silencer element from the human genome called T39, and the comparison of T39 to three other putative silencer elements previously described by others. Functional analysis included one assay for enhancer-blocking insulator activity and two independent assays for silencer activity, all based on stable transfection and comparison to a neutral spacer control. In erythroid K562 cells, T39 exhibited potent silencer activity, the previously described element PRE2-S5 exhibited modest silencer activity, and the two other previously described elements exhibited no silencer activity. T39 was further found to be capable of silencing three disparate promoters, of silencing gene expression in three disparate cell lines, and of functioning as a single copy in a topology-independent manner. Of the four elements analyzed, only T39 exhibits a constitutive pattern of DNase hypersensitivity and binding by CTCF. In its native location the T39 element also exhibits a unique interaction profile with a subset of distal putative regulatory elements. Taken together, these studies validate T39 as a constitutive autonomous silencer, identify T39 as a defined control for future studies of other regulatory elements such as insulators, and provide a basic chromatin profile for one highly potent silencer element."
https://openalex.org/W2050309553,"Urinary tract infections are commonly caused by α-hemolysin (HlyA)-producing Escherichia coli. In erythrocytes, the cytotoxic effect of HlyA is strongly amplified by P2X receptors, which are activated by extracellular ATP released from the cytosol of the erythrocytes. In renal epithelia, HlyA causes reversible [Ca2+]i oscillations, which trigger interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 release. We speculate that this effect is caused by HlyA-induced ATP release from the epithelial cells and successive P2 receptor activation. Here, we demonstrate that HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in renal epithelia were completely prevented by scavenging extracellular ATP. In accordance, HlyA was unable to inflict any [Ca2+]i oscillations in 132-1N1 cells, which lack P2R completely. After transfecting these cells with the hP2Y2 receptor, HlyA readily triggered [Ca2+]i oscillations, which were abolished by P2 receptor antagonists. Moreover, HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were markedly reduced in medullary thick ascending limbs isolated from P2Y2 receptor-deficient mice compared with wild type. Interestingly, the following HlyA-induced IL-6 release was absent in P2Y2 receptor-deficient mice.

This is exceedingly interesting because it implies that ATP will be released from any cell attacked by HlyA and thus, P2 receptors will be activated in an auto- and paracrine fashion directly subsequent to membrane insertion of HlyA.

This notion is supported by several studies, which show that extracellular ATP is a keen trigger of IL-6/IL-8 release from other cell types (14.Douillet C.D. Robinson 3rd, W.P. Milano P.M. Boucher R.C. Rich P.B. Nucleotides induce IL-6 release from human airway epithelia via P2Y 2 and p38 MAPK-dependent pathways.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

ATP stimulates interleukin-6 production via P2Y receptors in human HaCaT keratinocytes.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 540: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we show that HlyA induced [Ca2+]i oscillations both in renal epithelial cells in culture (Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells) and isolated medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) from mice require P2 receptor activation. In MDCK cells and mTAL isolated from P2Y2+/+ mice, the HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were markedly lowered by scavenging of extracellular ATP by apyrase. In murine mTAL, the HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were significantly less pronounced in P2Y2−/− mice compared with control. These data were substantiated in biosensor cells that do not express any type of P2 receptors. We demonstrate that HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations could only be inflicted when these cells had been transfected with hP2Y2 receptors and thus, the HlyA effect completely depends on P2 receptor expression. Moreover, HlyA readily inflicted IL-6 release from the renal inner stripe of outer medulla (ISOM) from P2Y2+/+ mice, whereas this response was completely absent in P2Y2−/− mice. These data pinpoint extracellular ATP as an early signaling molecule in the epithelial response to bacterial virulence factors. Thus, ATP-mediated P2 receptor signaling is likely to be a crucial player in the following inflammatory response. Type 1 MDCK cells (passage 56–69) from the American Type Culture Collection (LGC Standards, Boras, Sweden) and 132-1N1 astrocytoma cells were grown in a monolayer on 25-mm diameter coverslips (VWR, Denmark) or in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Invitrogen, Taastrup, Denmark), 2 mm glutamine and 1 unit ml−1 of penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 of streptomycin but without riboflavin and phenol red as previously described (19.Praetorius H.A. Spring K.R. Bending the MDCK cell primary cilium increases intracellular calcium.J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The hP2Y2-transfected 132-1N1 astrocytoma cells were kindly provided by Robert Nicholas (Chapel Hill, NC) and grown in DMEM with 440 μg ml−1 of geneticin. mTALs were isolated by manual dissection from ISOM from P2Y2+/+ and P2Y2−/− mice (3–6 weeks) of either sex. The mice were on a B6D2/SV129 background, generously provided by Dr. B. H. Koller, University of North Carolina, NC. Animals were kept and handled according to the Danish animal welfare regulation. HlyA was purified from the E. coli strain ARD6 (O6:K13:H1) as described (20.Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Nicaud J.M. Holland I.B. Escherichia coli hemolysin may damage target cell membranes by generating transmembrane pores.Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used in a concentration (EC50) that produces 50% hemolysis of human erythrocytes (1.25% v/v, 60 min at 37 °C). This was determined as hemoglobin release measured as A540 nm of the supernatant in PowerWave Microplate Spectrophotometer, Biotek Instruments, Winooski, VT. Cell cultures and mTAL were loaded with 5 μm fluo 4-AM and mounted in a semi-open perfusion chamber (modified RC-21BRFS, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). The cultured cells were imaged at 1 Hz on an inverted microscope (TE-2000, Nikon) with ×60/1.4 NA planApo objective (Nikon), a monochromator (488 nm, Visitech International, Sunderland, UK), and emission collected >520 nm by an intensified SVGA CCD camera and imaging software (Quanticell 2000/Image Pro, VisiTech). The mTALs were imaged at 1 Hz by ×40/1.35 NA planApo objective (Olympus), a monochromator (488 nm, Polychrome V, Till-Phototonics, Munich, Germany), and emission was collected by an iCCD-camera (sensicam qe, PCO, Kelheim, Germany) and software Live Acquisition (Till-Photonics, Munich, Germany). All experiments were carried out at 37 °C, pH 7.4, and fluorescence intensity was expressed relative to baseline. Regions of interest were placed over each of the cultured cells or side-by-side along the entire mTAL length and analyzed in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). ISOM was dissected and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM in the presence or absence of HlyA (EC50). Samples of the supernatant were frozen immediately (−20 °C, storage <10 days). Cytokines were measured by a mouse IL-6 solid phase sandwich ELISA kit from BD Bioscience and a mouse keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) solid phase sandwich ELISA kit from RayBiotech, Inc. (Norcross, GA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The amount of IL-6 and KC was determined by absorbance at 450 and 570 nm in a plate reader (PowerWave, Biotek Instruments, Winooski, VT). MDCK cells grown in 96-well plates were incubated for 1 h in HEPES-buffered solution at 37 °C. ATP release was determined by luciferin/luciferase (Invitrogen) in the presence or absence of HlyA (EC50) with slight modifications to the instruction. All experiments included a standard row and samples and standards were read in a Mithras LB940 Multimode Reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Probenecid, ATP-2′,3′-dialdehyde (oxidized ATP), ATP, and apyrase were purchased from Sigma. Fluo 4-AM was from Invitrogen and MRS2179 were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, UK). YB-074 was kindly provided by Prof. Christa Müller (University of Bonn, Germany).

HlyA is known to inflict reversible [Ca2+]i oscillations in proximal tubule cells from rat (12.Uhlén P. Laestadius A. Jahnukainen T. Söderblom T. Bäckhed F. Celsi G. Brismar H. Normark S. Aperia A. Richter-Dahlfors A. α-Haemolysin of uropathogenic E. coli induces Ca2+ oscillations in renal epithelial cells.Nature. 2000; 405: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our data shows that HlyA similarly induces reversible [Ca2+]i oscillations in MDCK cells, a cell line isolated from canine distal tubules (Fig. 1). Fig. 1a shows the spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations previously reported for this cell type (13.Geyti C.S. Odgaard E. Overgaard M.T. Jensen M.E. Leipziger J. Praetorius H.A. Slow spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations reflect nucleotide release from renal epithelia.Pflugers Arch. 2008; 455: 1105-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Five minutes after addition of HlyA (EC50), there was a significant increase in [Ca2+]i oscillatory activity (Fig. 1, b and d). The HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were reversible and the cells were still able to respond with an increase in [Ca2+]i when exposed to ATP after washout of HlyA (Fig. 1, c and e). Please note that none of the cells showed a sudden drop in fluo 4-fluorescence upon exposure to HlyA, and thus do not lyse during the observation period. Scavenging of extracellular ATP with apyrase (10 units ml−1, Fig. 2, a–e) abolished the HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in MDCK cells, suggesting involvement of purinergic signaling. Because scavenging of ATP markedly reduces the cellular response to HlyA, we anticipate that HlyA may trigger ATP release from MDCK cells. Fig. 2f shows that ATP release from MDCK cells increased immediately after addition of HlyA (EC50). However, it does not become statistically significantly different from control before 12 min incubation because of the mechanically induced ATP release that occurs upon addition of HlyA or vehicle. The release of ATP stayed elevated throughout the observation period.FIGURE 2.HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in MDCK cells are inhibited by scavenging of ATP released by the epithelial cells. a, representative trace showing baseline [Ca2+]i oscillations in the presence of apyrase (10 units ml−1). b, [Ca2+]i oscillations after application of HlyA (EC50) in the presence of apyrase (10 U ml−1). c, the response to ATP after 5 min washout of apyrase. d, the summarized data with the ATP scavenger apyrase (10 units ml−1, n = 10). e, the summarized ATP response after washout of apyrase. f, the relative release of ATP from control MDCK cells without HlyA, and from MDCK cells with HlyA in a concentration that causes 50% hemolysis in erythrocytes (n = 18).

Renal epithelial cells generally express a large variety of different P2 receptors (21.Leipziger J. Control of epithelial transport via luminal P2 receptors.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 284: F419-F432Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22.Unwin R.J. Bailey M.A. Burnstock G. Purinergic signaling along the renal tubule: the current state of play.News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 237-241PubMed Google Scholar). The unspecific P2 receptor antagonists (PPADS and suramin) completely abolished the HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in MDCK cells (data not shown). To completely block all P2 receptor subtypes, the concentration of P2 receptor antagonists has to be substantial and thus, potentially cause unspecific effects. Therefore, we tested the effect of HlyA on ATP-biosensor cells. The 132-1N1 astrocytoma cell line does not express any P2 receptor subtypes and are thus, ideal control cells for potential P2 mediated signaling. In native 132-1N1 cells, addition of HlyA only caused discrete increases in [Ca2+]i, which could not be detected over baseline (Fig. 3, a, b, and g). The lacking effect was not a result of the inability of these cells to create receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i increases in general, because the muscarine receptor agonist, carbachol (100 μm), caused a sharp rise in [Ca2+]i in native 132-1N1 cells (Fig. 3, c and j). Note the complete lack of effect of ATP (100 μm), which complies with a total absence of P2 receptors in these cells. The 132-1N1 cells, which are stably transfected with the hP2Y2 receptor, show spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig. 3d), which markedly increase after addition of HlyA (Fig. 3, e and h). The HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in hP2Y2-transfected 132-1N1 cells could be inhibited by the non-selective P2 receptor antagonist suramin (Fig. 3i). These results show that [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by HlyA require P2 receptor activation in both MDCK and 132-1N1 cells. To investigate the effect of HlyA in native renal epithelia, we used isolated murine mTAL, which has been extensively investigated with regard to its functional P2 receptor expression (23.Jensen M.E. Odgaard E. Christensen M.H. Praetorius H.A. Leipziger J. Flow-induced [Ca2+]i increase depends on nucleotide release and subsequent purinergic signaling in the intact nephron.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). mTAL isolated from P2Y2+/+ mice showed spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations with a mean value of 8.31 ± 1.33 oscillations 100 μm−1 min−1 with an average amplitude of 0.17 ± 0.08 arbitrary units (n = 19 in total). Please note that separate control experiments were done for each set of experiments and the values given are the average of all control experiments on mTAL from P2Y2+/+. After addition of HlyA (EC50) to the basolateral side, the [Ca2+]i oscillatory activity increased significantly to a mean value of 29.38 ± 2.21 oscillations 100 μm−1 min−1 (n = 19, Figs. 4d and 5a, p < 0.0001) with an average amplitude of 0.25 ± 0.10 arbitrary units. We tested the viability of the tubule by addition of ATP (10 μm) or HEPES with a high Ca2+ concentration (5 mm) to stimulate Ca2+-sensing receptors. This caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4c) and an increase in fluorescence to minimally 1.2 arbitrary units was used as inclusion criteria. These results show that HlyA induces [Ca2+]i oscillations in freshly isolated murine mTAL. In the presence of the ATP scavenger apyrase (10 units ml−1), the effect of HlyA on [Ca2+]i oscillatory activity was completely abolished in P2Y2+/+ mTAL (Fig. 4d). These results show that HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in freshly isolated tubules is dependent on ATP signaling.FIGURE 5.The effect of HlyA in P2Y2−/− mTAL and the effect of P2 receptor antagonist on [Ca2+]i oscillatory activity after addition of HlyA. a, bar graph showing the summarized [Ca2+]i oscillations (100 μm−1 min−1) after addition of HlyA (EC50) in P2Y2+/+ (n = 13) and P2Y2−/− mTAL (n = 10). b, bar graph showing mean change (100 μm−1 min−1) in [Ca2+]i oscillatory activity after addition of HlyA (EC50) in P2Y2 KO and P2Y2 WT and in the presence of the irreversible non-selective P2X receptors antagonist oxidized ATP (50 μm) (n = 11) or the P2Y6 receptor antagonist YB-074 (100 μm) (n = 5).

Nephrol. 2007; 18: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and thus, we tested the HlyA-induced response in mTAL from P2Y2−/− mice. The baseline [Ca2+]i oscillatory activity of mTAL isolated from P2Y2−/− mice was 5.64 ± 1.41 oscillations 100 μm−1 min−1 (n = 10), which was not statistically significantly different from baseline activity in mTAL from P2Y2+/+ mice (Fig. 5a). Although HlyA still induced an increase in [Ca2+]i oscillations to 17.08 ± 2.51 (n = 10) in mTAL isolated from P2Y2−/− mice, the HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were statistically significantly lower in P2Y2−/− mTAL compared with P2Y2+/+ mTAL (p = 0.021, Fig. 5a). Note that we used the same inclusion criteria for mTAL from P2Y2−/− mice, despite the ATP response is known to be qualitatively different in P2Y2−/− compared with P2Y2+/+ (23.Jensen M.E. Odgaard E. Christensen M.H. Praetorius H.A. Leipziger J. Flow-induced [Ca2+]i increase depends on nucleotide release and subsequent purinergic signaling in the intact nephron.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These results indicate that P2Y2 receptors are important for the HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in murine mTAL. Because the HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations are abolished in the presence of apyrase, the remaining HlyA-induced oscillatory activity in the P2Y2−/− mTAL could potentially suggest that P2Y2 is not the only P2 receptor activated after addition of HlyA. The murine mTAL also expresses P2X receptors on the basolateral side of the tubule (23.Jensen M.E. Odgaard E. Christensen M.H. Praetorius H.A. Leipziger J.

To test if these receptors are involved in the HlyA-induced [Ca2+]i oscillatory activity observed in P2Y2−/− mTAL, we used the irreversible selective P2X receptor antagonist oxidized ATP. Fig. 5b shows that oxidized ATP (50 μm) did not reduce [Ca2+]i oscillations in P2Y2−/− mTAL further (p = 0.64) at a concentration that was shown to completely block ATP-induced transport inhibition in mTAL (24.Marques R.D. de Bruijn P.I.

https://openalex.org/W1981469180,"Loess shoulder-lines are significant structural lines which divide the complicated loess landform into loess interfluves and gully-slope lands. Existing extraction algorithms for shoulder-lines mainly are based on local maximum of terrain features. These algorithms are sensitive to noise for complicated loess surface and the extraction parameters are difficult to be determined, making the extraction results usually inaccurate. This paper presents a new extraction approach for loess shoulder-lines, in which Marr-Hildreth edge operator is employed to construct initial shoulder-lines. Then the terrain mask for confining the boundary of shoulder-lines is proposed based on slope degree classification and morphology methods, avoiding interference from non-valley area and modify the initial loess shoulder-lines. A case study is conducted in Yijun located in the northern Shanxi Loess Plateau of China. The Digital Elevation Models with a grid size of 5 m is applied as original data. To obtain optimal scale parameters, the Euclidean Distance Offset Percentages between shoulder-lines is calculated by the Marr-Hildreth operator and the manual delineations. The experimental results show that the new method could achieve the highest extraction accuracy when σ = 5 in Gaussian smoothing. According to the accuracy assessment, the average extraction accuracy is about 88.5%, which indicates that the proposed method is applicable for the extraction of loess shoulder-lines in the loess hilly and gully areas."
https://openalex.org/W2067543559,"Splenomegaly and pancytopenia are common in Wilson’s disease (WD) and splenectomy is one of the conventional treatments for splenomegaly and the associated pancytopenia. However, splenectomy remained controversial for hypersplenism in WD as it was reported that splenectomy leaded to serious emotional and neurological deterioration in WD patients with hypersplenism. In the current study, we present our experiences in 70 WD patients with hypersplenism who had undergone splenectomy, outlining the safety and efficacy of splenectomy in WD. The clinical database of 70 WD patients with hypersplenism who had undergone splenectomy in our hospital between 2009 and 2013 were reviewed and followed-up regularly. Before splenectomy, all the patients accepted a short period of anti-copper treatment with intravenous sodium 2, 3-dimercapto-1-propane sulfonate (DMPS). All the patients demonstrated a marked improvement in platelet and leucocyte counts after splenectomy. No severe postoperative complication was observed. In particular, none of the 37 patients with mixed neurologic and hepatic presentations experienced neurological deterioration after splenectomy, and none of the patients with only hepatic presentations newly developed neurological symptoms. During the one year follow-up period, no patient presented hepatic failure or hepatic encephalopathy, no hepatic patient newly developed neurological presentations, and only 3 patients with mixed neurologic and hepatic presentations suffered neurological deterioration and these 3 patients had poor compliance of anti-copper treatment. Quantative analysis of the neurological symptoms in the 37 patients using the Unified Wilson’s Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) showed that the neurological symptoms were not changed in a short-term of one week after splenectomy but significantly improved in a long-term of one year after splenectomy. Additionally, compared to that before splenectomy, the esophageal gastric varices in most patients significantly improved one year after splenectomy. Thus, we may conclude that splenectomy is a safe and effective therapeutic measure for hypersplenism in WD patients who had been preoperatively treated with DMPS for powerful anti-copper therapy."

Here, iEC-induced PIs were used to study the expression and posttranslational modification of the ECM receptor integrin β1.

https://openalex.org/W2069605591,"The objective was to establish and standardise a broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for porcine Bordetella (B.) bronchiseptica. B. bronchiseptica isolates from different geographical regions and farms were genotyped by macrorestriction analysis and subsequent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. One reference and one type strain plus two field isolates of B. bronchiseptica were chosen to analyse growth curves in four different media: cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMHB) with and without 2% lysed horse blood, Brain-Heart-Infusion (BHI), and Caso broth. The growth rate of each test strain in each medium was determined by culture enumeration and the suitability of CAMHB was confirmed by comparative statistical analysis. Thereafter, reference and type strain and eight epidemiologically unrelated field isolates of B. bronchiseptica were used to test the suitability of a broth microdilution susceptibility testing method following CLSI-approved performance standards given in document VET01-A4. Susceptibility tests, using 20 antimicrobial agents, were performed in five replicates, and data were collected after 20 and 24 hours incubation and statistically analysed. Due to the low growth rate of B. bronchiseptica, an incubation time of 24 hours resulted in significantly more homogeneous minimum inhibitory concentrations after five replications compared to a 20-hour incubation. An interlaboratory comparison trial including susceptibility testing of 24 antimicrobial agents revealed a high mean level of reproducibility (97.9%) of the modified method. Hence, in a harmonization for broth microdilution susceptibility testing of B. bronchiseptica, an incubation time of 24 hours in CAMHB medium with an incubation temperature of 35°C and an inoculum concentration of approximately 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml was proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1973767540,"Minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MITKA) has been developed to reduce surgical trauma and facilitate rehabilitation after arthroplasty. A plausible hypothesis is that this reduced trauma results in lower concentrations of circulating inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP). In this study, we compared CRP concentrations in patients undergoing MITKA to those undergoing conventional TKA (CTKA). Eight hundred and seven patients undergoing MITKA were prospectively recruited. CRP was measured before operation and on days 2, 4, 21, and 42 after operation. Two hundred and forty-seven patients who had CTKA were collected retrospectively, with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as those who had MITKA. We found in both groups, that CRP values rose abruptly after operation, with peak values reached on day 2 or 4. Values then declined so that by days 21 and 42 they were only modestly above baseline values. Throughout the entire study period, mean CRP in MITKA patients did not differ significantly from those in CTKA patients. However, a significantly higher proportion of CTKA patients than of MITKA patients had peak CRP values at day 4 rather than at day 2 (76.8% vs 42.5%), a difference that was more pronounced in women. Also, by day 42, CRP values were still above baseline in 18.5% of MITKA patients and 28.8% of CTKA patients without known complications. In conclusion, CRP distribution pattern was similar in patients who received MITKA or CTKA,. CRP values remained slightly elevated in both MITKA and CTKA patients for as long 42 days after operation. These findings suggest that MITKA is no less traumatic than CTKA, as determined by CRP values, and the patterns of postoperative CRP may be useful in the management of TKA patients."
https://openalex.org/W1991790884,"Impaired bone healing can have devastating consequences for the patient. Clinically relevant animal models are necessary to understand the pathology of impaired bone healing. In this study, two impaired healing models, a hypertrophic and an atrophic non-union, were compared to physiological bone healing in rats. The aim was to provide detailed information about differences in gene expression, vascularization and histology during the healing process. The change from a closed fracture (healing control group) to an open osteotomy (hypertrophy group) led to prolonged healing with reduced mineralized bridging after 42 days. RT-PCR data revealed higher gene expression of most tested osteogenic and angiogenic factors in the hypertrophy group at day 14. After 42 days a significant reduction of gene expression was seen for Bmp4 and Bambi in this group. The inhibition of angiogenesis by Fumagillin (atrophy group) decreased the formation of new blood vessels and led to a non-healing situation with diminished chondrogenesis. RT-PCR results showed an attempt towards overcoming the early perturbance by significant up regulation of the angiogenic regulators Vegfa, Angiopoietin 2 and Fgf1 at day 7 and a further continuous increase of Fgf1, -2 and Angiopoietin 2 over time. However µCT angiograms showed incomplete recovery after 42 days. Furthermore, lower expression values were detected for the Bmps at day 14 and 21. The Bmp antagonists Dan and Twsg1 tended to be higher expressed in the atrophy group at day 42. In conclusion, the investigated animal models are suitable models to mimic human fracture healing complications and can be used for longitudinal studies. Analyzing osteogenic and angiogenic signaling patterns, clear changes in expression were identified between these three healing models, revealing the importance of a coordinated interplay of different factors to allow successful bone healing."
https://openalex.org/W1487892464,"Gene-wide association and candidate gene studies indicate that the greatest effect on multiple sclerosis (MS) risk is driven by the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele within the HLA-DR15 haplotype (HLA-DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*0602-DRB5*01:01). Nevertheless, linkage disequilibrium makes it difficult to define, without functional studies, whether the functionally relevant effect derives from DRB1*15:01 only, from its neighboring DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 or DRB5*01:01 genes of HLA-DR15 haplotype, or from their combinations or epistatic interactions. Here, we analyzed the impact of the different HLA-DR15 haplotype alleles on disease susceptibility in a new “humanized” model of MS induced in HLA-transgenic (Tg) mice by human oligodendrocyte-specific protein (OSP)/claudin-11 (hOSP), one of the bona fide potential primary target antigens in MS.

This study, which shows for the first time a functional HLA-DQA1/DRB1 mixed isotype heterodimer and its potential association with disease susceptibility, provides a rationale for a potential effect on MS risk from DQA1*01:02 through functional DQA1*01:02;DRB1*15:01 antigen presentation.

MS is a disease with a strong underlying genetic component. Susceptibility has long been linked to the HLA-DR15 haplotype (DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*0602-DRB5*01:01) and, particularly, the HLA-DRB1*1501 locus, dominating MS risk in Caucasians (3.Olerup O.

Genome-wide association and candidate gene studies have suggested that the effects of the DR15 haplotype on MS risk are driven by the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele and that effects on MS from neighboring alleles may reflect linkage disequilibrium (5.International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium, Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 Sawcer S.

However, linkage disequilibrium, particularly between DRB1*1501 and DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602, makes it difficult for genetic studies to discern, without functional studies, whether the functionally relevant effect on MS derives from DRB1*15:01 only, from its neighboring DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 or DRB5*01:01 genes of the HLA-DR15 haplotype, or from their combinations or epistatic interactions. HLA-transgenic (Tg) mice constitute a valuable resource for dissecting the association of disease susceptibility with the specific gene products of the HLA-DR15 haplotype. The susceptibility of HLA-DRB1*1501-Tg mice to MBP- or MOG-induced EAE (7.Altmann D.M. Douek D.C. Frater A.J. Hetherington C.M. Inoko H. Elliott J.I.

However, our recent studies showing that the DQB1*0602 allele, rather than DRB1*1501, determines disease susceptibility to MOBP (9.Kaushansky N. Altmann D.M. Ascough S. David C.S. Lassmann H.

Autoimmun. 1998; 11: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but, unlike MBP, PLP, MOG, and MOBP, neither the potentially pathogenic OSP epitopes relevant to HLA-DR15+ MS nor the HLA-DR15 haplotype gene product(s) that may determine OSP-related disease susceptibility has been investigated. In this study, HLA-DR15-Tg mice were employed first to determine immunogenic/immunodominant epitopes of human OSP/claudin-11 (hOSP) and their potential pathogenic relevance to HLA-DR15+ MS and, second, to study whether DRB1*15:01 or DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 alleles or their combinations control pathogenic T-cell autoimmunity against hOSP. We show that the DR15 haplotype-associated T-cell autoimmunity against hOSP is probably focused on a single immunodominant epitope (hOSP(142–161)) and that pathogenic autoimmunity against hOSP(142–161) is controlled by the DRB1*15:01 allele, not only as the isotypic heterodimer but, unexpectedly, also as a functional DQA1*01:02;DRB1*15:01 mixed isotype hybrid heterodimer. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a functional DQA1*01:02;DRB1*15:01 mixed isotype heterodimer and show its potential relevance to MS pathogenesis. The demonstration of functional interaction between DQA1*01:02 and DRB1*15:01 not only further highlights the complex effects of HLA class II genes on susceptibility to MS but also provides a rationale for a potential contribution of the DQA1*01:02 allele to MS risk through antigen presentation via functional DQA1*01:02;DRB1*15:01 mixed isotype heterodimers and not only through epistasis with DRB1*15:01 (13.Lincoln M.R.

After washing the column with 25 column volumes of PBS, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, captured HLA class II molecules were eluted with 4–5 column volumes of 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm diethylamine, pH 11, directly into one-twentieth volume of a neutralizing buffer (2 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.3). The eluate was then concentrated, and the buffer was changed to PBS, 0.1% NaN3 by ultracentrifugation in a Centricon p-20 unit (Millipore). The product was analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE, and total protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a reference protein. Inhibition assays were performed essentially as described (24.Hansen B.E. Andersson E.C. Madsen L.S. Engberg J. Søndergaard L. Svejgaard A. Fugger L.

Varying concentrations of competitor peptide were incubated overnight at 25 °C with constant concentrations of either HLA-DRB1*1501 (20 nm) plus biotinylated myelin basic protein peptide b-MBP(85–99) (ENPVVHFFKNIVTPR) (25.Ota K.

The formed DRB1*1501·peptide complexes or the HLA-DQB1*0602·peptide complexes were quantified by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C in a 96-well microtiter plate (MaxiSorb, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) precoated with 1 μg/well L243 (anti-DR) or SPV-L3 (anti-DQ) in carbonate buffer, pH 9.0, and blocked with 5% FCS in PBS. The free peptides and the unbound complexes were washed off of the plate with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Europium-labeled streptavidin was added at 100 ng/ml and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, Eu3+ was released by adding enhancement solution to the wells and measured in a time-resolved fluorometer (Victor, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). IC50 values were monitored as the concentration of unlabeled peptide that prevented 50% of the biotinylated peptide from binding to the HLA-DRB1*1501 or the HLA-DQB1*0602 protein. For Fig. 6C, horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin (Abcam) was diluted 5000-fold in washing buffer and added to the ELISA wells and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The substrate, 3′5,5′-tetrametylbenzidine (DAKO), was added and stopped after 15–30 min. with an equal volume of H2SO4, and the transformed substrate was measured at 450 nm. Putative core epitopes within the hΔOSP and mΔOSP sequences were detected as described previously for I-As molecules (18.Kerlero de Rosbo N.K. Kaye J.F. Eisenstein M. Mendel I. Hoeftberger R.

Thus, the experimental structures of HLA-DRB1*1501(DRA;DRB1*15:01) or -DQB1*0602 (DQA1*01:02;DQB1*06:02) molecules (Protein Data Bank codes 1BX2, 1YMM, and 2WBJ for DRB1*1501 and 1UVQ for DQB1*0602) were analyzed, and 4 × 20 binding preference matrices were constructed, which tabulate estimates of the tendency of an amino acid to bind in one of the specificity-determining pockets of the HLA binding site, P1, P4, P6, and P9. The binding estimates were based on the physical properties of the pockets, their size, hydrophobicity, polarity, and charge. Thus, highly preferred residues were given a score of −2, less preferred residues were scored −1, residues that would neither contribute nor hinder the binding were scored 0, and residues that were likely to hinder binding weakly or strongly (e.g. by being too large) were given a score of 1 or 2, respectively. The binding preference matrices were used to estimate the binding ability of overlapping 9-amino acid segments of the target sequences to the HLA binding site.

The knowledge of the molecular cues underlining this phenomenon is one of today's most challenging issues and could represent a major contribution toward a better understanding of the onset of testicular morphogenetic disorders. R-spondin 1 has been clearly established as a candidate for mammalian ovary determination. Conversely, very little information is available on the expression and role of R-spondin 1 during testicular morphogenesis. This study aims to clarify the distribution pattern of R-spondin 1 and other partners of its machinery during the entire period of testicular morphogenesis and to indicate the role of this system in testicular development. Our whole mount immunofluorescence results clearly demonstrate that R-spondin 1 is always detectable in the testicular coelomic partition, where testicular vasculature is organized, while Dickkopf-1 is never detectable in this area. Moreover, organ culture experiments of embryonic male UGRs demonstrated that Dickkopf-1 acted as an inhibitor of testis vasculature formation. Consistent with this observation, real-time PCR analyses demonstrated that DKK1 is able to slightly but significantly decrease the expression level of the endothelial marker Pecam1. The latter experiments allowed us to observe that DKK1 administration also perturbs the expression level of the Pdgf-b chain, which is consistent with some authors' observations relating this factor with prenatal testicular patterning and angiogenesis. Interestingly, the DKK1 induced inhibition of testicular angiogenesis was rescued by the co-administration of R-spondin 1. In addition, R-spondin 1 alone was sufficient to enhance, in culture, testicular angiogenesis."

Thereby, liprins are able to form multiprotein complexes needed to regulate numerous cellular activities (41.Wei Z. Zheng S. Spangler S.A. Yu C. Hoogenraad C.C. Zhang M.

A region in the liprin-α N terminus overlapping the coiled-coil domain has recently been mapped as directly binding the open form of mDia1 contacting the DID of the regulatory N terminus (mDiaN). The expression of this liprin-α3 domain in HeLa cells displaces mDia1 from the plasma membrane and reduces actin stress fiber formation (29.Sakamoto S. Ishizaki T. Okawa K. Watanabe S. Arakawa T. Watanabe N. Narumiya S. Liprin-α controls stress fiber formation by binding to mDia and regulating its membrane localization.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Binding of active RhoA is not sufficient to fully activate formins, suggesting that additional events, such as post-translational modifications or binding to proteins and phospholipids, are needed (22.Maiti S.

The mouse Formin mDia1 is a potent actin nucleation factor regulated by autoinhibition.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To switch off formin function, these activating events must be counterbalanced. Here, we aim at elucidating how liprin-α3 binds to mDia1 and regulates its function counteracting RhoA activation, resulting in reduction in cellular actin filament formation. Does it use the same binding site as DAD or active RhoA on mDiaN, and how is RhoA and DAD binding affected by the presence of liprin-α3? Human RhoA and mouse mDia1 fragments were expressed and purified as described in the final buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) (26.Lammers M. Meyer S. Kühlmann D. Wittinghofer A. Specificity of interactions between mDia isoforms and Rho proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35236-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Liprin-α3 fragments and mutants were purified accordingly. Point mutations in mDia1, liprin-α3, and DAD were created using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). All protein concentrations of mDiaN, DAD, and liprin-α3 were determined using the absorption at 280 nm (A280). For DAD(1145–1200)/DAD(1145–1209) and for liprin-α3 fragments with a low extinction coefficient at A280, tryptophan residues were added at the N terminus for concentration determination. The RhoA concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Expedeon). Peptides were synthesized on a Rink amide resin using an automated solid phase peptide synthesizer (MultiSynthec) and following standard Fmoc/tert-butanol strategy. The resin load (Rink amide resin) was 15 μmol, and for each coupling step, seven equivalents of Fmoc-amino acid and seven equivalents of activation reagents (ethyl 2-cyano-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate and diisopropylcarbodiimide) were used. N-terminal fluorescein labeling was achieved by using 3 eq of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein (CF) and 3 eq of ethyl 2-cyano-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate and diisopropylcarbodiimide, respectively. All reactions were performed in N,N-dimethylformamide. For final cleavage of the peptides, the resin was treated with TFA/triisopropylsilane/water (95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)) for 3 h. Subsequently, peptides were precipitated by the addition of ice-cold diethylether, washed, and lyophilized. All peptides were purified using preparative reverse phase HPLC and analyzed by LC-electrospray ionization-MS (LCQ, FinniganMAT, Thermo) with a gradient of 20–70% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) in water (0.08% TFA) for 15 min. Lip(567–587) (TPRSARLERMAQALALQAGSP): 2223.6 Da (calc.), 2223.9 Da (exp.); F-Lip(567–587) (CF-GSG-TPRSARLERMAQALALQAGSP): 2784.11 Da (calc.), 2784.32 Da (exp.); F-Lip(567–582) (CF-GSG-TPRSARLERMAQALAL): 2343.65 Da (calc.), 2343.62 Da (exp.). The experiments were performed at 20 °C using a SX20 Applied Photophysics spectrometer (Leatherhead, UK). The mant-GppNHp nucleotide was excited at 350 nm, and the emission was recorded using a 420-nm cut-off filter. For the association kinetics, a constant concentration of 250 nm (final) RhoA·mant-GppNHp was titrated with increasing concentrations of mDiaN (final 0.6–40.7 μm) without/with the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of liprin-α3. The obtained data follow a pseudo-first-order binding kinetics. The fluorescence was plotted as a function of time and fitted to a single exponential function to result in the observed rates (kobs) for each concentration. The slope of the linear fit of the plot of kobs versus protein concentration resulted in the association rate constant (ka). The dissociation rate constants (kd) were obtained by mixing a preformed 100 nm (final) mDiaN·RhoA·mant-GppNHp complex with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled RhoA Q63L (final 10 μm). In the experiments with liprin-α3, 10 μm (final) of liprin-α3 was added to RhoA Q63L. GraphPad Prism version 6.0 was used for data analysis. The interactions of liprin-α3/mDiaN, mDiaN/DAD, and mDiaN/RhoA; the mutational analysis of the liprin-α3-mDia1 interface; and the competition experiments were performed on an ITC200 instrument at 20 °C (GE Healthcare) (65.Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Rapid measurement of binding constants and heats of binding using a new titration calorimeter.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). For a typical experiment, 2 μl of protein in the syringe (200–500 μm) was stepwise injected into the cell solution of protein in concentrations of 20–50 μm, depending on the interaction analyzed. In the competition experiments, 270 μm protein in the syringe was titrated to a complex of a 2-fold molar excess of liprin-α3 (54 μm) over mDia1 (27 μm) in the cell. The binding isotherms obtained were fitted to a one-site or competitive binding model using Origin version 7.0 and the integrated MicroCal software, in which stoichiometry (N), enthalpy change (ΔH), and the equilibrium association constant (KA) are directly obtained from the experimental data (44.Sigurskjold B.W. Exact analysis of competition ligand binding by displacement isothermal titration calorimetry.Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We used the standard EDTA-CaCl2 sample tests as described by MicroCal to assess the statistical significance of individual observations. These gave values within the manufacturer's tolerances of ±20% for KA values and ±10% in ΔH. All experiments were done using a Paradigm Detection Platform (Beckman Coulter). The CF-FITC-labeled F-Lip(567–587) and F-Lip(567–582) peptides were excited at 485 nm, and the emission was detected at 535 nm. The experiments were performed in buffer A at 37 °C, and the integration time was 500 ms. F-Lip(567–587) and F-Lip(567–582) (100 nm) were incubated with 10 μm mDiaN or 10 μm mDiaN plus 15 μm RhoA Q63L. The solutions were preincubated until the equilibrium was reached, and the polarization signal was stable. Measurements without liprin-α3 peptides served as blank values. Data analysis was done with GraphPad Prism version 6.0. Crystals of DID (aa 135–369) and Lip(567–587) grew in mother liquor containing 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 20% PEG 6000 (buffer C) overnight at 20 °C using the sitting drop/vapor diffusion method (150 nl of protein at 10 g/liter plus 150 nl of buffer C). The crystals had a final size of ∼50 × 50 × 50 μm and were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen in buffer C containing 30% (w/v) of d-glucose as cryoprotectant. A native data set was collected at 100 K on beamline X06DA at a wavelength of 1.0 Å using a Dectris Pilatus 2M detector at the Swiss Light Source (SLS), Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The detector distance was 165 mm, the oscillation range was 0.1°, and 1800 frames were collected. The program suite CCP4 was used for structure determination (45.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The Ccp4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19747) Google Scholar). Data were indexed and integrated with MOSFLM version 7.0.9 and scaled with SCALA version 3.3.20 (46.Leslie A.G.W. Powell H.R. Processing diffraction data with MOSFLM.Evolving Methods Macromol. Crystallogr. 2007Crossref Google Scholar, 47.Evans P. Scaling and assessment of data quality.Acta Crystallogr.

Crystallogr. 1997Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group C2 (C121) and contained two Lip(567–587)·DID heterodimers in the asymmetric unit. Initial phases were determined with the program Phaser using residues 135–369 of chain B of the mDiaN·RhoC structure (PDB code 1Z2C) to search for two molecules (49.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

The program Coot version 0.7.1 was used to build the model into the 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc electron density maps in iterative rounds of refinement with REFMAC5 (50.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G.

https://openalex.org/W1987678997,"An efficient method for crossing green foxtail (Setaria viridis) is currently lacking. S. viridis is considered to be the new model plant for the study of C4 system in monocots and so an effective crossing protocol is urgently needed. S. viridis is a small grass with C4-NADP (ME) type of photosynthesis and has the advantage of having small genome of about 515 Mb, small plant stature, short life cycle, multiple tillers, and profuse seed set, and hence is an ideal model species for research. The objectives of this project were to develop efficient methods of emasculation and pollination, and to speed up generation advancement. We assessed the response of S. viridis flowers to hot water treatment (48°C) and to different concentrations of gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, maleic hydrazide (MH), and kinetin. We found that 500 μM of MH was effective in the emasculation of S. viridis, whilst still retaining the receptivity of the stigma to pollination. We also report effective ways to accelerate the breeding cycle of S. viridis for research through the germination of mature as well as immature seeds in optimized culture media. We believe these findings will be of great interest to researchers using Setaria."
https://openalex.org/W1979005503,"Electrograms stored in Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD-EGM) have been proven to convey useful information for roughly determining the anatomical location of the Left Ventricular Tachycardia exit site (LVTES). Our aim here was to evaluate the possibilities from a machine learning system intended to provide an estimation of the LVTES anatomical region with the use of ICD-EGM in the situation where 12-lead electrocardiogram of ventricular tachycardia are not available. Several machine learning techniques were specifically designed and benchmarked, both from classification (such as Neural Networks (NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)) and regression (Kernel Ridge Regression) problem statements. Classifiers were evaluated by using accuracy rates for LVTES identification in a controlled number of anatomical regions, and the regression approach quality was studied in terms of the spatial resolution. We analyzed the ICD-EGM of 23 patients (18±10 EGM per patient) during left ventricular pacing and simultaneous recording of the spatial coordinates of the pacing electrode with a navigation system. Several feature sets extracted from ICD-EGM (consisting of times and voltages) were shown to convey more discriminative information than the raw waveform. Among classifiers, the SVM performed slightly better than NN. In accordance with previous clinical works, the average spatial resolution for the LVTES was about 3 cm, as in our system, which allows it to support the faster determination of the LVTES in ablation procedures. The proposed approach also provides with a framework suitable for driving the design of improved performance future systems."
