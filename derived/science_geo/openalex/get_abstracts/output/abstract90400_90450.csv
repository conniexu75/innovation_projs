https://openalex.org/W2084334026,"We have previously described a gene, secA, which may code for a component of the secretion machinery of E. coli. Temperature-sensitive mutations in this gene lead to the cytoplasmic accumulation of precursors to a number of secreted proteins. In this paper, we describe the use of antibody to the SecA protein to characterize the cellular location and regulation of the protein. The antibody was elicited in response to a SecA-LacZ hybrid protein, produced by a strain carrying a secA-IacZ gene fusion. The secA gene product is a 92 kd polypeptide that is present in small amounts in the cell and that fractionates as a peripheral cytoplasmic membrane protein. The synthesis of the SecA protein is greatly derepressed (at least tenfold) when secretion in E. coli is blocked either in a secAts mutant or in the presence of a MaIE-LacZ hybrid protein. We suggest that components of the secretion machinery of E. coli, such as the SecA protein, may be regulated in response to the secretion needs of the cell. When suppression of a secAam mutant is eliminated, leading to the absence of SecA protein, the synthesis of maltose-binding protein is greatly reduced. These results support a mechanism in which secretion and translation are coupled."

The monophosphoryl lipid A was further fractionated by preparative thin layer chromatography. This process yielded three major bands (TLC-1, -3, and -5) and two minor bands (TLC-7 and -9). The purity of these fractions was established by ion exchange and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The thin layer fractions were analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. TLC-1 and -3 gave molecular ions (M-H)- at m/e 1730 and 1716, respectively. Both of these fractions contained beta-hydroxymyristic, lauric, and 3-myristoxymyristic acids in O-acyl linkages. The molecular formula and Mr of TLC-1 are C95H179O22N2P and 1731.16; those of TLC-3 are C94H177O22N2P and 1717.15. TLC-1 was a methyl homolog of TLC-3. The major component of TLC-5 (C80H151O22N2P and Mr = 1506.99) gave a molecular ion at m/e 1506 and contained two beta-hydroxymyristic acids and a lauric acid in the O-acyl linkages. The major component of TLC-7 (C66H125O19N2P and Mr = 1280.83) and the single component of TLC-9 gave molecular ions at m/e 1280 and 1098, respectively. TLC-7 contained lauric and beta-hydroxymyristic acids in the O-acyl linkages. TLC-9 (C54H103O18N2P and Mr = 1098.69) contained a single O-acylated beta-hydroxymyristate group. TLC-1 and -3 were nontoxic in the chick embryo lethality test and regressed established tumors in the syngeneic guinea pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2169856028,"The intermediate filament cytoskeleton of cultured bovine kidney epithelial cells and human HeLa cells changes dramatically during mitosis. The bundles of cytokeratin and vimentin filaments progressively unravel into protofilament-like threads of 2-4 nm diameter, and intermediate filament protein is included in numerous, variously sized (0.2-1.5 microns) spheroidal aggregates containing densely stained granular particles of 5-16 nm diameter. We describe these mitotic bodies in intact cells and in isolated cytoskeletons. In metaphase to anaphase of normal mitosis and after colcemid arrest of mitotic stages, many cells contain all their detectable cytokeratin and vimentin material in the form of such spheroidal aggregate bodies, whereas in other mitotic cells such bodies occur simultaneously with bundles of residual intermediate filaments. In telophase, the extended normal arrays of intermediate filament bundles are gradually reestablished. We find that vimentin and cytokeratins can be organized in structures other than intermediate filaments. Thus, at least during mitosis of some cell types, factors occur that promote unraveling of intermediate filaments into protofilament-like threads and organization of intermediate filament proteins into distinct granules that form large aggregate bodies. Some cells, at least certain epithelial and carcinoma cells, may contain factors effective in structural modulation and reorganization of intermediate filaments."

https://openalex.org/W1485191693,"The extent of phosphorylation of S6 was measured in a variety of cells, organs, and tissues using a simplified procedure. Ribosomal proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a one-dimensional urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel. They were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, and S6 was specifically stained by means of its reaction with a monoclonal antibody. The mobility of the stained protein was shown to be a measure of the extent of its phosphorylation. Using this method, we found that cycloheximide injection of rats gives rise to the phosphorylation of S6 in a variety of organs and tissues: diaphragm, heart and skeletal muscle liver and kidney, but not brain. Diabetes induced with alloxan did not result in the phosphorylation of S6 in any of the tissues examined, and subsequent insulin injection resulted in a slight increase in the phosphorylation of S6 in liver. Insulin injection in normal rats also caused the phosphorylation of liver S6. Unilateral denervation of rat diaphragm resulted in phosphorylation of S6 in the denervated portion but not in the innervated portion of the diaphragm."

https://openalex.org/W1999685455,"Periodic transcription of yeast histone genes has been demonstrated by DNA excess filter hybridization of in vivo pulse-labeled RNA isolated from synchronous cell cultures. Using strains carrying cell division cycle (cdc) mutations, we show that both activation and termination of transcription are determined by temporally separable (cell cycle) events. Activation of histone mRNA synthesis occurs late in G1, at a point prior to initiation of DNA replication. Cessation of histone mRNA synthesis, however, is dependent upon the entry of cells into S. These results suggest a simple model for the control of histone gene transcription in which changes in chromatin that must precede the initiation of DNA replication also bring about activation of histone mRNA synthesis. Cessation of synthesis would occur once this region had been replicated and the chromatin restored to its prereplicative state."

Concentrations of gossypol as low as 0.01 micromolar markedly reduced the growth rate of T. cruzi in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2032349908,"Intermediate filament structure and distribution were studied by antibody decoration and low-angle shadowing of sonicated chicken erythrocytes and embryonic erythroid cells. Intermediate filaments containing vimentin and synemin form a three-dimensional network in these cells, interlinking the nucleus and plasma membrane. This filament network is spatially segregated from the marginal band of microtubules, indicating that these two systems do not interact directly in the development or maintenance of cell shape. Incubation of sonicated cells with an antiserum specific for vimentin results in uniform decoration of the intermediate filaments; incubation with antisynemin results in decoration of periodically spaced foci. Measurement of the synemin periodicity under a specified set of sample preparation conditions gives average values of 180 nm for adult erythrocytes and 230 nm for 10 day old embryonic erythroid cells, suggesting some fundamental change in the structure of the filaments during erythropoiesis. Registration of these foci in laterally associated filaments, and decoration of bridges between slightly separated filaments, suggest that synemin mediates crosslinking of intermediate filaments through self-interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1985931938,"The renin regulatory locus (Rnr) is a genetic element governing mouse submaxillary gland (SMG) renin levels. A 45,000 dalton polypeptide detectable after in vitro translation of mouse SMG mRNA has been identified by genetic and physical criteria as SMG renin. A cDNA recombinant clone specific for SMG renin has been isolated and used to demonstrate that the previously described genetic regulation of SMG renin levels is manifest at the level of renin mRNA concentration. The renin cDNA clone has also been used in Southern blot analyses to study the organization of homologous DNA sequences in strains carrying different alleles at the Rnr locus. Restriction digest patterns of high renin strains (Rnrs) are characteristically distinct from patterns observed for low renin strains (Rnrb) and are suggestive of a structural gene duplication at the chromosome 1 locus in high renin strains. However, gene dosage cannot account for the increased levels in high renin strains, since SMG renin levels in Rnrs and those in Rnrb may differ up to 100-fold."

https://openalex.org/W1551884505,"In vitro transcription of DNA from plasmid pBR322 was coupled to cell-free translation in a wheat germ system. The major translation product was pre-beta-lactamase. Upon addition of dog pancreas microsomes, the precursor was processed to authentic beta-lactamase as shown by partial NH2-terminal sequence analysis. Processing was linked to translocation into the microsomal vesicles. Salt-extracted microsomes did not process pre-beta lactamase but could be reactivated by purified signal recognition particle, which is the functional component of the salt wash (Walter, P., and Blobel, G. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 7112-7116). Signal recognition particle alone caused a drastic translation arrest that could be released by salt-depleted membranes. These data are consistent with those obtained for eukaryotic proteins and suggest that co-translational translocation of both bacterial and eukaryotic secretory proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum require identical components."
https://openalex.org/W1546280954,"The cytosolic dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase III (EC 3.4.14.4) from rat brain was partially purified using Arg-Arg-4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide as a substrate. It was completely separated from aminopeptidase B on DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography. Similar to bovine pituitary dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase III, it has a pH optimum of 9, prefers Arg-Arg-4-methoxy-beta-naphthylamide as a substrate, and catalyzes the sequential release of dipeptides from the NH2 terminus of peptide substrates provided they are not smaller than a tetrapeptide. Among numerous biologically active peptides tested, angiotensins and enkephalins were the most preferred substrates with micromolar affinities, suggesting that dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase III may play a physiologic role in regulating enkephalin and/or angiotensin disposition."
https://openalex.org/W1503561348,"There is rapid and specific channeling of ribonucleoside diphosphates into DNA through reactions beginning with ribonucleotide reductase and terminating with DNA polymerase. Lysolecithin-permeabilized Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts in culture rapidly reduced ribonucleoside diphosphates by ribonucleotide reductase action when dithiothreitol was provided as a reducing agent and incorporated these deoxynucleotides into DNA. The radioactive label provided in ribo-CDP was not diluted by added deoxyribo-CTP during its incorporation into DNA, showing that the ribo-CDP does not pass through a deoxy-CTP pool. Under the conditions that permitted rapid incorporation of ribonucleoside diphosphates, deoxynucleoside triphosphates were very poorly incorporated. Ribonucleotide reductase with the rate-limiting enzyme for the overall process. The Km values for the reductase reaction and the overall process were similar and low enough for saturation by in vivo pools. Natural feedback inhibitors dATP or dTTP inhibited incorporation of labeled ribo-CDP into deoxyribonucleotides and into DNA to the same extent. Ribonucleotide reductase behaved like other enzymes that are associated in a rapidly sedimenting form. It was concentrated in the nucleus during S phase, and most of the enzyme activity in these nuclear extracts was co-sedimented with DNA polymerase on sucrose density gradients. These data support the hypotheses that a physically associated complex of enzymes (replitase) catalyzes the production of deoxynucleotides and their incorporation into DNA in S phase cells."
https://openalex.org/W1487890301,"Proteinase A and proteinase B, two vacuolar enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are synthesized as larger precursors with apparent molecular weights of approximately 52,000 and 42,000, respectively. These precursor molecules are processed to their mature forms of 42,000 molecular weight for proteinase A and 33,000 molecular weight for proteinase B. In the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of the synthesis of protein-asparagine linked carbohydrate moieties, two smaller molecular forms each of precursor and mature proteinase A were synthesized, indicating that proteinase A contains N-linked carbohydrate which is apparently not required for processing. Tunicamycin interferes also with the glycosylation of the proteinase B precursor, whereas no unglycosylated mature proteinase B could be detected."
https://openalex.org/W1585833237,"LFA-1, an antigen associated with antigen-specific T lymphocyte-mediated killing, and Mac-1, a macrophage differentiation antigen associated with type three complement receptor function, contain alpha chains of Mr = 180,000 and 170,000, respectively, and beta chains of Mr = 95,000. The monoclonal antibodies defining these antigens do not cross-react. The LFA-1 and Mac-1 beta chains are highly homologous or identical, whereas the alpha chains are highly different by tyrosyl tryptic peptide mapping (Kurzinger, K., Ho, M. K., and Springer, T. A. (1982) Nature (Lond.) 296, 668-670). T lymphoma cell lines express LFA-1 but not Mac-1 as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation. Conversely, some macrophage-like lines express Mac-1 but not LFA-1. Other macrophage-like lines co-express Mac-1 and small amounts of LFA-1. Mac-1 and LFA-1 are present as separate molecules in these cells. [35S]Methionine and [[3H]glucosamine are incorporated into both alpha and beta chains of Mac-1 and LFA-1, showing both chains are endogenously synthesized and are glycoproteins. Cross-linking and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments show that in both Mac-1 and LFA-1 the alpha and beta chains are noncovalently associated in alpha 1 beta 1 quaternary structures. By quantitative immunofluorescence flow cytometry, the EL-4 T lymphoma and P388D1 macrophage-like lines were estimated to express 10(5) LFA-1 and 1.6 x 10(5) Mac-1 molecules/cell, respectively. From these sources the antigens have been purified to homogeneity in 200-400-micrograms quantities by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. The purified antigens contain only the alpha and beta subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2122528529,"The gene II region of bacteriophage f1 DNA codes for two proteins, the 46 kd gene II protein and the 13 kd gene X protein, which results from an in-phase start at codon 300 of gene II. Using antigene II protein IgG, we show that the intracellular concentration of both proteins is controlled by the phage gene V protein. In wild-type f1-infected cells, the amount of gene II protein reaches a plateau of about 1500 molecules per cell at 20 min after infection, as measured by blot immunoassay. Similarly, the amount of gene X protein reaches a peak of about 500 molecules per cell around 10 min after infection. In contrast, when the gene V protein is inactive, both gene II and gene X proteins continue to accumulate at a high rate for at least 40 min after infection. This difference is caused by decreased synthesis of gene II and gene X proteins in the presence of gene V protein, which represses the translation of these two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1572599689,"Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase has been purified by a simple, two-column procedure from an Escherichia coli K12 strain carrying the glnS structural gene on plasmid pBR322. The primary sequence of this enzyme as derived from the DNA sequence (see accompanying paper) has been confirmed. Manual Edman degradation was used to identify the NH2-terminal sequence of the protein. Oligopeptides scattered throughout the primary sequence of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase were sequenced by the gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method and matched to the theoretical peptides derived from the translated DNA sequence. The expected carboxyl terminus at position 550 was verified by carboxypeptidase B digestion. The primary sequence of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase contains no extensive sequence repeats. A search was made for sequence homologies between this enzyme and the few other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for which primary sequences are available. A single homologous region is shared by at least three of the synthetases examined here."
https://openalex.org/W1653821563,"ATP (or dATP) stimulates DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme) on the synthetic template-primer poly(dA).oligo(dT)12. Nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs and other natural (deoxy)ribonucleoside triphosphates are inactive. Because the nonhydrolyzable analog 5'-deoxyadenylylimidodiphosphate is efficiently used by holoenzyme for incorporation, the ATP (or dATP) requirement for activation of replication of natural DNA could be determined. Analysis of lag times in DNA synthesis and isolation of intermediates showed that ATP (or dATP) is required in the formation of an initiation complex between holoenzyme and primed DNA template, but not for subsequent DNA synthesis. ATP is bound to holoenzyme in the absence of DNA with a KD value of 0.8 microM; 2 to 3 molecules of ATP per molecule of holoenzyme are bound without apparent cooperativity. Binding of ATP to DNA polymerase III (holoenzyme minus beta subunit) is weak (KD greater than 5 microM) and binding to the beta subunit alone is not observed. However, holoenzyme reconstituted by mixing DNA polymerase III with beta subunit binds ATP as tightly (KD = 0.6 microM) as the original holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1524933186,"Ovalbumin, unlike other secretory proteins, is synthesized and secreted without cleavage of a hydrophobic signal peptide. Kinetic experiments were performed in a cell-free translation system to measure the minimum size of ovalbumin nascent chains required for binding of both the nascent chain and the corresponding mRNA to microsomal membranes derived from dog pancreas. Results of these experiments revealed that 50 to 60 amino acid residues are sufficient to bind ovalbumin-synthesizing polysomes to membranes in vitro. When microsomes with associated polysomes were isolated from chick oviduct, nascent ovalbumin chains longer than 50 residues were protected from proteolysis as long as the membranes remained intact, suggesting that the polypeptides were sequestered by the endoplasmic reticulum. We conclude that the functional signal for membrane translocation of ovalbumin becomes accessible when the nascent chain is 50 to 60 residues long. We speculate that the hydrophobic sequence which lies between residues 25 and 45 folds back on the preceding residues to form an amphipathic hairpin structure which is the signal element recognized by the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1974580897,"E. coli RecA protein promotes homologous pairing in two distinguishable phases: synapsis and strand exchange. With circular single strands (plus strand only) and linear duplex DNA, polarized or unidirectional strand exchange appeared to cause heteroduplex joints to form and grow from a unique end of the duplex DNA. However, a variety of other pairs of substrates appeared to form joint molecules without regard to the polarity of the strands involved. This paradox has been resolved by observations that show that synapsis is fast, nonpolar and sensitive to inhibition by ADP, whereas strand exchange is slow, directional and relatively insensitive to inhibition by ADP. Thus a heteroduplex joint initiated at one end of the duplex DNA grows by continued strand exchange, whereas a joint initiated at the other end dissociates and is unable to start again because accumulating ADP inhibits synapsis. RecA protein appears to form a nascent protein-DNA structure, the RecA synaptic structure, in which at least 100-300 bp in the duplex molecule are held in an unwound configuration and in which the incoming strand is aligned with its complement."
https://openalex.org/W1531995193,"The mechanism of insulin's action upon intracellular proteolysis in isolated hepatocytes was studied. At 37 degrees C insulin inhibited intracellular degradation of intracellular proteins in a dose-dependent manner. A maximal 40% inhibition of intracellular proteolysis was achieved at an insulin concentration of 500 ng/ml with a half-maximal inhibition observed at 2.5 ng/ml of insulin. Insulin inhibited intracellular proteolysis both in the presence and in the absence of amino acids in the incubation mixture. Low concentrations of trypsin (10 micrograms/ml) mimicked insulin's effect upon glucose incorporation into glycogen, but not on intracellular proteolysis. Four protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mM), p-nitrophenyl-p-guanidinobenzoate (0.25 mM), p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (1 mM), and N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (1 mM) blocked the stimulatory effect of insulin upon [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen, but did not affect the inhibitory action of insulin upon intracellular proteolysis. These results suggest that the mechanism of insulin's action upon intracellular proteolysis differs from that involved in stimulation of glycogenesis. Low temperature (15 degrees C) and short time exposure (10 min) of the hepatocytes to insulin eliminated the inhibitory effect of insulin on intracellular proteolysis. Similarly, insulin's effect on intracellular proteolysis was eliminated by dansylcadaverine, a transglutaminase inhibitor that blocked insulin internalization. In contrast, dansylcadaverine had no effect on insulin's ability to stimulate [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen. These experiments strongly suggest the necessity of insulin internalization for its inhibitory effect on endogenous protein degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2010190722,"A novel method of affinity chromatography on insolubilized collagen-binding fragments of fibronectin was utilized to isolate a random-coil collagenous protein from culture media of mouse teratocarcinoma-derived endodermal cells. These cells also produced another collagenous protein, which did not bind to fibronectin but could be isolated by differential salt precipitation. The affinity-purified collagen differs from its conventionally isolated counterpart in that it is not triple-helical in structure, its polypeptides are not disulfide-crosslinked and it has affinity for fibronectin in its native state. Both collagens resemble previously characterized type IV basement-membrane collagens with respect to their amino acid composition, cyanogen bromide peptides, chain size, immunological reactivity and tissue localization. The random-coil collagen is directly active in promoting the attachment of some lines of cells, but for attachment of the endodermal cells addition of fibronectin is required. This suggests that the presence of nonhelical, fibronectin-binding collagen may have biological significance in the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1495014993,"The recent finding that the lymphocyte insulin receptor is covalently labeled after '261-insulin binding (Saviolaskis, G., Harrison, L. c., and Roth, J. (1981) J. BioL Chem 256,4924-4928) led us to directly test a previous hypothesis that insulin binds via disulfide bonds. % Insulin was bound to isolated rat adipocytes at 37 C, the cells were washed extensively at 37 C to remove nondissociable radioactivity, and then extracted in Triton X-lOO/Dulbecco's buffer containing protease inhibitors. The solubilized radioactivity obtained after centrifugation at 100,000 X g was chromatographed on Sephadex G-50 and resolved as a major high molecular weight (HMW) peak and two smaller peaks representing intact and degraded %insulin, respectively. The formation of the HMW component was dependent on the concentration of 1261-insulin, although the total formed did not exceed 10% of the specifically bound radioactivity. Its formation was inhibited in a dosedependent manner by sulfhydryl-blocking agents in concentrations that did not alter specific binding. The HMW component was also formed in paraformaldehyde-treated cells and in adipocyte membranes. It eluted at the position of the native Triton-solubilized insulin receptor on Sepharose CL6B chromatography and was immunoprecipitated by antireceptor antibodies. Radioactivity bound to the receptor in the HMW complex was dissociated by the reducing agent dithiothreitol and eluted off Sepharose CL-GB at the position of reduced '261-insulin. Oxidative sulfitolysis revealed that the radioactivity in the HMW complex was present in both A and B chains of insulin, in the same proportions as in intact '261-insulin. We conciude that a fraction of bound insuLin becomes covalently linked to its receptor via a disulfide-sulfhydry1 exchange on the cell surface. The significance of this modification in initiating insulin action deserves further study."

A rapid purification method based on affinity chromatography is described for the isolation of this enzyme from an E. coli K12 strain which contains a plasmid containing the structural gene for S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, and which overproduces this enzyme. The purified enzyme contains one pyruvate moiety on each of six subunits. The enzyme is inactivated by incubation with carbonyl group reagents such as NaBH4 and phenylhydrazine; after inactivation, 1 mol of lactate or 1 mol of phenylhydrazone is found/mol of enzyme subunit. The enzyme is also inactivated by NaCNBH3 but only in the presence of either substrate or product and the divalent metal ion activator Mg2+; inactivation is accompanied by incorporation of 1 mol of the product, decarboxylated adenosylmethionine, per mol of enzyme subunit, suggesting that the pyruvoyl group participates in catalysis by formation of a Schiff base with the substrate. Equilibrium dialysis studies indicated a single substrate (or product) binding site/enzyme subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1495614407,"The present study demonstrated that at physiological concentrations of insulin bacitracin inhibited the degradation of specifically bound insulin by enzymes located in the rat adipocyte plasma membrane. Bacitracin increased the amount of intact insulin specifically bound to the plasma membrane and potentiated the stimulation of adipocyte glucose oxidation by submaximal concentrations of the hormone. In contrast to agents such as chloroquine, which inhibit lysosomal degradation of internalized insulin, bacitracin was shown by two approaches to inhibit a degradative process localized to the adipocyte plasma membrane. Cyanide and 2,4-dinitrophenol, agents which inhibit energy requiring endocytosis, had no effect on the bacitracin inhibition of cellular degradation of 125I-insulin. Bacitracin directly inhibited 125I-insulin degradation by isolated plasma membranes at similar concentrations and to a similar extent as found with cells. The degradative process inhibited by bacitracin accounted for the majority of cellular degradation of the hormone. The increased 125I-insulin bound to adipocytes was shown to be intact by gel chromatographic analysis and was localized to the plasma membrane by direct and indirect approaches. Bacitracin increased 125I-insulin specifically bound to isolated plasma membranes as early as 2 min. The 125I-insulin bound to adipocytes in the presence of bacitracin was completely dissociable by the addition of 8 microM unlabeled insulin whereas a significant portion of 125I-insulin bound to chloroquine-treated cells could not be dissociated. Bacitracin slowed dissociation of 125I-insulin from the cells. Bacitracin increased the 125I-insulin binding to cells in the presence and absence of cyanide and 2,4-dinitrophenol. Bacitracin potentiated the stimulation of adipocyte glucose oxidation at submaximal concentrations of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1541300405,"DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holenzyme) has an ATPase activity elicited only by a primed DNA template. Reaction of preformed ATP.holoenzyme complex with a primed template results in hydrolysis of the ATP bound to the holoenzyme, release of ADP and Pi, and formation of an initiation complex between holoenzyme and the primed template. Approximately two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed for each initiation complex formed, a value in keeping with the number bound in the ATP.holoenzyme complex. The possibility that the latter and the initiation complex contain two holoenzyme molecules is supported by the presence of two beta monomers in the initiation complex. Holoenzyme action in the absence of ATP resembles that of pol III (the holoenzyme core) or DNA polymerase III (holoenzyme lacking the beta subunit), with or without ATP, in sensitivity to salt and in processivity of elongation. The initiation complex formed by ATP-activated holoenzyme resists a level of KCl (150 mM) that completely inhibits nonactivated holoenzyme and the incomplete forms of the holoenzyme, and displays a processivity at least 20 times greater. Upon completing replication of available template, holoenzyme can dissociate and form an initiation complex with another primed template, provided ATP is available to reactivate the holoenzyme. By inference, no essential subunits are lost in the cycle of initiation, elongation and dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1576415461,"Escherichia coli elongation factor (EF-Tu) binds aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNA) not only in the presence of GTP but also in the presence of GDP. Complex formation leads to a protection of the aa-tRNA against nonenzymatic deacylation and digestion by pancreatic ribonuclease, as well as to a protection of EF-Tu against proteolysis by trypsin. The equilibrium constant for the binding of Phe-tRNAPheyeast for example to EF-Tu.GDP has been determined to be 0.7 X 10(5) M-1 which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than the equilibrium constant for Phe-tRNAPheyeast binding to EF-Tu.GTP. In the presence of kirromycin, aminoacyl-tRNA binding to EF-Tu.GDP is not affected as much: Phe-tRNAPheyeast is bound with an equilibrium constant of 3 X 10(5) M-1. While there is also a measurable interaction between EF-Tu.GTP and tRNA, such an interaction cannot be detected with EF-Tu.GDP and tRNA, not even at millimolar concentrations. A so far undetected complex formation between aminoacyl-tRNA and EF-Tu.GTP in the presence of pulvomycin, however, could be detected. The results are discussed in terms of the structural requirements of ternary complex formation and in the light of proofreading schemes involving A-site binding on the E. coli ribosome."

https://openalex.org/W1563959390,"The radiation target size for invertase activity has been determined for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycoprotein which contains 50% carbohydrate. Identical inactivation curves were observed for the native enzyme as well as samples depleted of carbohydrate by incubation with Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. The functional unit of 120,000 daltons was unaltered by the per cent of oligosaccharide cleaved by the enzyme, or by the presence or absence of the released sugars. The irradiated samples showed no change in hexose content even after radiation exposures which grossly destroyed enzymatic activity. Reducing sugars appeared in the irradiated samples, indicating radiation damage to the oligosaccharides. These results unequivocally identify the enzymatically functional portion of the invertase molecule as the polypeptide homodimer, independent of the covalently-bound carbohydrates, and indicate that transfer of radiation energy from protein to oligosaccharide or vice versa is inefficient."

https://openalex.org/W1496740453,"Extracellular matrix proteins produced by a mouse skeletal muscle cell line, G8-1, were isolated and characterized. Cultures were incubated with [35S]methionine or [3H]glycine and [3H]proline, and the labeled, substrate-attached proteins were obtained after cellular proteins were extracted by deoxycholate in neutral salt. The labeled matrix was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography before and after enzymatic digestion. Of the nine major bands present in the matrix, four were identified. Fibronectin and collagen were detected on the bases of their relative mobilities, differential labeling with 3H-versus 35S-labeled amino acids and their solubilization by protease free collagenase. High molecular weight material which was present in the matrix was also sensitive to collagenase and probably included cross-linked collagen and laminin. Proteins co-migrating with actin and myosin were also present in the extracellular matrix. These results are novel in that they demonstrate that the skeletal muscle phenotype, not contaminated with fibroblastic elements, is able to synthesize basal lamina-type macromolecules and incorporate them into an insoluble, extracellular matrix. Since this cell line is able to form functional synaptic contacts with neuronal cells, the influence of nerve on basal lamina production by muscle in vitro is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2028846716,A synthetic antagonist of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone blocked ovulation in rats in a dose-dependent manner when given by gavage on the afternoon of proestrus. Ovulation was delayed for at least 1 day in all animals given 2 milligrams of antogonist and in some of the animals treated with 1 or 0.5 milligram. Oral administration of 2 milligrams also blocked the preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone. This demonstration that antagonists of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone can have oral antiovulatory activity clearly enhances their therapeutic potential.
https://openalex.org/W1559583316,"The biosynthesis of pyrophosphoethanolamine residues linked to the core oligosaccharide region of the lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli K2 strain BB 26-36 has been investigated by means of isotope tracer experiments in living cells. Phosphoethanolamine was isolated from the pyrophosphoethanolamine residues after hydrolysis in 1 N HCl at 100 degrees C. The kinetics of labeling of the phosphoethanolamine from [3H]serine or sn-glycero-3-32P during pulse-chase experiments revealed that the biosynthetic precursor of the phosphoethanolamine must be a large, relatively stable pool, and not a small, rapidly metabolized pool such as that of free serine, or seryl-tRNA. Labeling of the pyrophosphoethanolamine residues of the lipopolysaccharide from the two isotopes was closely parallel, and the isotope ratio 3H/32P was closely similar to that in phosphatidylethanolamine at the same time intervals. These experiments offer strong evidence that phosphatidylethanolamine functions in the biosynthesis of pyrophosphoethanolamine residues in lipopolysaccharide in a reaction in which the phosphoethanolamine head-group of the phospholipid is transferred as a unit to a lipopolysaccharide acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1542842200,"Kinetic studies of the rat adipocyte hexose transport system were performed using the integrated rate approach and these compared to the simple carrier model of transport. Equilibrium exchange 3-O-methylglucose entry and exit studies showed directional symmetry with Km = overall dissociation constants = 8-10 mM. Comparison of zero-trans and equilibrium exchange entry also revealed similar Km and Vmax values. Insulin pretreatment increased the maximal rate of transport at 20 mM 3-O-methylglucose about 5- to 6-fold with each procedure. Studies of glucose-induced steady state 3-O-methylglucose countertransport provided evidence that carrier permeability and not carrier-substrate dissociation was rate limiting for overall transport. These data, therefore, indicate equal mobility of the loaded and unloaded carriers. Network thermodynamic computer simulations of the simple carrier model using kinetic parameters derived from zero-trans experiments provided good fits of actual data. The effect of insulin was best represented by an increase in total number of carrier units. It is concluded that the adipocyte hexose carrier displays bidirectional symmetry, limitation of transport by carrier movement rather than substrate-carrier interaction, equal rates of movement of loaded and unloaded carriers, and adherence to a simple carrier model in which insulin increases the total number of carrier units."
https://openalex.org/W1555487611,"Isotope exchange at equilibrium has been used to study the kinetic mechanism of the choline acetyltransferase reaction. The choline-acetylcholine, acetyl-CoA-acetylcholine, and CoA-acetyl-CoA exchange patterns are qualitatively consistent with a Theorell-Chance mechanism. However, quantitative differences are observed when the experimental results are compared to theoretical fits of the data for a Theorell-Chance mechanism. It is concluded that the kinetic mechanism of the choline acetyltransferase reaction can best be described as a random Theorell-Chance mechanism in which a low but finite amount of ternary complex exists."
https://openalex.org/W1567818962,"Retinol dehydrogenase solubilized by Lubrol 12A9 from bovine retinal rod outer segments forms mixed micelles of Stokes radius 8.5 nm. The kinetic properties of the solubilized retinol dehydrogenase were examined and retinaldehyde reduction and retinol oxidation were seen to proceed at pH 8.3 by a sequential Ordered Bi Bi mechanism. This conclusion was supported by bisubstrate initial velocity studies, dead-end and product inhibition. The kinetic mechanism of retinol dehydrogenase is not altered by the effect of Lubrol until a concentration of 2 mM is reached, at which the detergent lowers the values of the Michaelis and dissociation constants. The catalytic rate of the retinol dehydrogenase is significantly lowered by detergent in the range of pH 3 to 9."
https://openalex.org/W1558695887,"The electron microscopic and hydrodynamic properties of factor V and factor Va-vesicle complexes were determined. Images of negatively stained factor V bound to vesicles showed the protein as a relatively large globular domain (9.5 nm diameter) connected to the membrane through a narrow protein region 0.5-3 nm in length. This connecting region was not always visible and was measured as the distance between the globular region and the apparent vesicle edge. Factor V protein alone usually appeared as two connected globular regions of 10.2 and 6.5 nm diameter. The two-domain protein structure appeared consistent with both the image of factor V alone and bound to the membrane. Factor V had no biological activity in a phospholipid-free prothrombinase assay system used. The proteolytically activated form of factor V generated by digestion with thrombin (factor Va) was at least 30,000 times more active. The electron microscopic images of factor Va-vesicle complexes showed a smaller protein that was more closely associated with the vesicle surface than was factor V. The light chain (Mr about 80,000) component of factor Va also bound to the surface of the vesicles and appeared to be largely external to the membrane. Protein-induced hydrodynamic radius changes for the factor V-vesicle and factor Va-vesicle complexes were 12.8 and 6.3 nm, respectively. The images observed in the electron microscope were used to calculate protein-induced radius changes. Comparison of these values with the experimentally determined hydrodynamic radius changes showed approximate agreement for factor Va-membrane complexes. However, the images of factor V-vesicle complexes suggested smaller hydrodynamic radius changes than were actually observed."
https://openalex.org/W1578380546,"Pyruvate oxidase, a tetrameric enzyme consisting of 4 identical subunits, dissociates into apoenzyme monomers and free FAD when treated with acid ammonium sulfate in the presence of high concentrations of potassium bromide. Reconstitution of the native enzymatically active protein can be accomplished by incubating equimolar concentrations of apomonomers and FAD at pH 6.5. The kinetics of the reconstitution reaction have been measured by 1) enzyme activity assays, 2) spectrophotometric assays to measure FAD binding, and 3) high performance liquid chromatography analysis measuring the distribution of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric species during reconstitution. The kinetic analysis indicates that the second order reaction of apomonomers with FAD to form an initial monomer-FAD complex is fast. The rate-limiting step for enzymatic reactivation appears to be the folding of the polypeptide chain in the monomer-FAD complex to reconstitute the three-dimensional FAD binding site prior to subunit reassociation. The subsequent formation of native tetramers appears to proceed via an essentially irreversible dimer assembly pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1538749943,"The interaction between 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) and yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (ATP:3-phospho-D-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.3) and the use of ANS as a probe for studying the structure and function of phosphoglycerate kinase has been investigated. The interaction has been studied by kinetic methods, equilibrium dialysis, and fluorometric titrations. ANS inhibits the activity of the enzyme. More than one inhibitor site exists. ANS is competitive with MgATP and noncompetitive with 3-phosphoglycerate at the first detected inhibitor binding site. The Ki value is 1-2 mM. Several ANS molecules bind to the enzyme. By fluorometric titrations the first detected site has a dissociation constant that is in the same range as Ki or bigger. When ANS interacts with phosphoglycerate kinase its fluorescence is increased and a blue shift occurs. ANS appears to bind to a strongly hydrophobic site. The fluorescence is sensitive to the addition of substrates. ADP, ATP, or combinations of Mg2+ and nucleotide decreases the fluorescence as does free Mg2+. 3-Phosphoglycerate, on the other hand, increases the fluorescence giving evidence for conformational changes upon 3-phosphoglycerate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1545969874,"In order to elucidate the complete amino acid sequence of Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P-450, tryptic digestion was performed on the S-carboxymethylated enzyme. Although cleavage did not occur at every lysyl and arginyl bond, 31 tryptic peptides ranging in size from 1 to 55 residues were isolated. These were sequenced by manual Edman degradation and carboxypeptidase digestion. Overlaps of some od these tryptic peptides were obtained by data obtained from partial Edman degradation and amino acid composition of the clostripain cleavage products. These results, together with data from the cyanogen bromide and acid cleavage peptides reported in the accompanying paper, established the complete amino acid sequence of P. putida cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1658192173,"Abstract Experiments have been performed to probe the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding region in Escherichia coli pyruvate oxidase. This enzyme functions as a membrane-associated flavoprotein coupled to the aerobic E. coli respiratory chain. The FAD moiety is noncovalently bound to pyruvate oxidase and can be removed reversibly to form apopyruvate oxidase. The addition of free FAD to apoenzyme results in the stoichiometric re-formation of the active flavoprotein. Using this technique, synthetic analogs of FAD were substituted in the flavin binding site and used as structural probes. Spectral analysis indicates that the benzoquinoid forms of 8-mercapto-FAD and 6-hydroxy-FAD are stabilized in the enzyme-binding site. This is consistent with the fact that the native flavoprotein forms a red (anion) radical upon photoreduction. These data suggest that the isoalloxazine ring may be poised for reduction via position N-5 by a carbanionic intermediate. The alpha-carbanion of hydroxyethylthiamin pyrophosphate, formed following the decarboxylation of pyruvate, is a likely candidate. The highly resolved visible spectrum of the native flavoprotein suggests that the flavin is buried in a hydrophobic environment. Reactivity studies using 8-chloro-FAD-pyruvate oxidase and 2-thio-FAD-pyruvate oxidase suggest that the C-8 position and C-2 position of the isoalloxazine ring may not be accessible to the solvent. Spectral perturbations observed with 6-hydroxy-FAD-pyruvate oxidase indicate, however, that the isoalloxazine C-6 position may be located near the binding site for the cofactor thiamin pyrophosphate. Restrictions to the accessibility of the active site of the enzyme are suggested by the fact that sulfite does not form an adduct with the flavin in the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1547017561,"Thymidine triphosphate, a negative regulator of deoxycytidylate deaminase, was found to bind covalently to this enzyme on exposure to UV light at 254 nM. The rate of half-maximal fixation was extremely rapid, occurring within 30 s and probably attaining a maximum of about 1 mol of dTTP fixed/mol of enzyme subunit. In contrast to the case of ribonucleotide reductase (Ericksson, S., Caras, I. W., and Martin, D. W., Jr. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 81-85) where the fixation of dTTP inactivated this enzyme, the activity of the deaminase was unaffected. The bound nucleotide could be released on exposure to UV 254 nm light in the presence of dCTP or dTTP but not dATP or dGTP. The enzyme-fixed nucleotide was found to remain with the larger of the two peptides released as a result of CNBr treatment of the labeled enzyme. Studies are in progress to define the location of this nucleotide, which will be aided greatly by our recent clarification of the complete amino acid sequence of T2-deoxycytidylate deaminase."
https://openalex.org/W1491393415,"Transcription of Q beta RNA replicase requires that the host-encoded Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S1 be present as a subunit of the replicase. To determine whether the activities of S1 in protein synthesis are operational in Q beta RNA transcription, we formed altered replicase enzymes by reconstituting replicase lacking S1 (R(-S1)) with modified S1 species whose properties in nucleic acid binding and protein synthesis had been previously established. S1 derivatized with N-ethylmaleimide reconstitutes a modified replicase that is 81% as active as replicase reconstituted with unmodified S1. S1 derivatized with N-ethylmaleimide and unmodified S1 bind with comparable affinity to R(-S1) (1 X 10(8) M-1). These results indicate that the helix-unwinding properties of S1, which are known to be inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide modification, are not required for Q beta RNA transcription and that the sulfhydryl-derivatized region of S1 is not utilized in replicase subunit contacts. In contrast with its established ability to replace E. coli S1 on the ribosome, Caulobacter crescentus S1 does not reconstitute Q beta RNA transcription activity when added to R(-S1). Our results suggest this inactivity may be due to poor binding to R(-S1)."
https://openalex.org/W1584772422,"High resolution thermal denaturation and circular dichroism studies were performed on a series of six recombinant DNA restriction fragments. The fragments varied in size from 132 to 193 bp and contained Escherichia coli wild type and UV5 lactose promoters both with and without homopolymer insertions of poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly(dG).poly(dC). A differential thermal destabilization of the wild type promoter region, as compared to the UV5 promoter, was observed when dA70.dT70 was inserted into the -60 region or both DNAs. This effect may depend, in part, on the differences in the base composition between adjoining cooperative units in the fragments. The relatively larger effect of the AT sequence on the wild type promoter region may be correlated with the increased levels of in vitro transcription activity described in the preceding paper (Klein, R. D., and Wells, R. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12962-12969). Stretches of homopolymeric GC base pairs stabilized the wild type and UV5 promoter regions by over 2.5 degrees C. CD studies could not detect conformational differences between DNAs containing the wild type or UV5 promoter. The presence of homopolymers had a marked effect on the CD spectra of the fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1545080560,"A reinvestigation of the copy number of protein S6 in Escherichia coli ribosomes shows that there is only one copy of S6 in 30 S subunits and in 70 S ribosomes. The previously reported higher value (Subramanian, A. R. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 6941-6946) is shown to arise from the presence in the usual ribosome preparations of a protein which co-electrophoreses with S6 but does not react with S6 antiserum. This protein is removed when ribosomes are purified by passage through a sucrose gradient."
