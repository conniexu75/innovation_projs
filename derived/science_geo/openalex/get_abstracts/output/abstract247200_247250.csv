https://openalex.org/W2156935469,"KLF4 (GKLF/EZF) encodes a transcription factor that is associated with both tumour suppression and oncogenesis. We describe the identification of KLF4 in a functional genomic screen for genes that bypass RAS(V12)-induced senescence. However, in untransformed cells, KLF4 acts as a potent inhibitor of proliferation. KLF4-induced arrest is bypassed by oncogenic RAS(V12) or by the RAS target cyclin-D1. Remarkably, inactivation of the cyclin-D1 target and the cell-cycle inhibitor p21CIP1 not only neutralizes the cytostatic action of KLF4, but also collaborates with KLF4 in oncogenic transformation. Conversely, KLF4 suppresses the expression of p53 by directly acting on its promoter, thereby allowing for RAS(V12)-mediated transformation and causing resistance to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis. Consistently, KLF4 depletion from breast cancer cells restores p53 levels and causes p53-dependent apoptosis. These results unmask KLF4 as a regulator of p53 that oncogenically transforms cells as a function of p21CIP1 status. Furthermore, they provide a mechanistic explanation for the context-dependent oncogenic or tumour-suppressor functions of KLF4."

https://openalex.org/W2039128518,"When dissimilar images are presented to the two eyes, they compete for perceptual dominance so that each image is visible in turn for a few seconds while the other is suppressed. Such binocular rivalry is associated with relative suppression of local, eye-based representations that can also be modulated by high-level influences such as perceptual grouping. However, it is currently unclear how early in visual processing the suppression of eye-based signals can occur. Here we use high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with a new binocular rivalry stimulus to show that signals recorded from the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit eye-specific suppression during rivalry. Regions of the LGN that show strong eye-preference independently show strongly reduced activity during binocular rivalry when the stimulus presented in their preferred eye is perceptually suppressed. The human LGN is thus the earliest stage of visual processing that reflects eye-specific dominance and suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2001752726,"We generated several cell models of tauopathy in order to study the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in diseases involving abnormal changes of tau protein. N2a neuroblastoma cell lines were created that inducibly express different variants of the repeat domain of tau (tauRD) when exposed to doxycycline (Tet-On system). The following three constructs were chosen: (i) the repeat domain of tau that coincides with the core of Alzheimer paired helical filaments; (ii) the repeat domain with the deletion mutation ΔK280 known from frontotemporal dementia and highly prone to spontaneous aggregation; and (iii) the repeat domain with ΔK280 and two proline point mutations that inhibit aggregation. The comparison of wild-type, pro-aggregation, and anti-aggregation mutants shows the following. (a) Aggregation of tauRD is toxic to cells. (b) The degree of aggregation and toxicity depends on the propensity for β-structure. (c) Soluble mutants of tauRD that cannot aggregate are not toxic. (d) Aggregation is preceded by fragmentation. (e) Fragmentation of tauRD in cells is initially due to a thrombin-like protease activity. (f) Phosphorylation of tauRD (at KXGS motifs) precedes aggregation but is not correlated with the degree of aggregation. (g) Aggregates of tauRD disappear when the expression is silenced, showing that aggregation is reversible. (h) Aggregation can be prevented by drugs and even pre-formed aggregates can be dissolved again by drugs. Thus, the cell models open up new insights into the relationship between the structure, expression, phosphorylation, aggregation, and toxicity of tauRD that can be used to test current hypotheses on tauopathy and to develop drugs that prevent the aggregation and degeneration of cells.

A number of human diseases are characterized by an age-related increase of abnormal protein deposits. This includes a group of diseases, termed “tauopathies,” where the microtubule-associated protein tau aggregates in a highly phosphorylated form. The best known examples are Alzheimer disease (AD), 3The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseFTDP-17frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17LDHlactate dehydrogenasePHFpaired helical filamentTauRDtau repeat domainZbenzyloxycarbonylFMKfluoromethyl ketonePBSphosphate-buffered salinewtwild typeThSthioflavine SPPACKd-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone. 3The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseFTDP-17frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17LDHlactate dehydrogenasePHFpaired helical filamentTauRDtau repeat domainZbenzyloxycarbonylFMKfluoromethyl ketonePBSphosphate-buffered salinewtwild typeThSthioflavine SPPACKd-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone. where tau deposits in the brain occur together with aggregates of the Aβ peptide, and FTDP-17, where mutant forms of tau accumulate abnormally (1Selkoe D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 11: 1054-1061Crossref Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 2Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). These changes lead to the loss of synapses, dying out of cell processes, and cell death. Hence, there is a strong interest in studying the pathways of abnormal aggregation and the development of cell and animal models. In the case of the amyloid pathology in AD, such models have been generated based on the overproduction of the Aβ peptide, and these models have led to drugs and treatments capable of reducing the plaque load (3Schenk D. Hagen M. Seubert P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Generating reliable models for tau pathology has been more difficult. Overproduction of tau as such does not lead to neurofibrillary aggregation but to axonal transport defects that show up, for example, as motor neuron disease in mice if tau is expressed in the wrong cell types (4Terwel D.

To generate neurofibrillary pathology, it has been necessary to enhance the toxicity of tau by mutations known from familial FTDP-17 or by combining tau mutations with enhanced Aβ load (6Lewis J.

These models allowed insights into the early steps of tangle formation, such as the relationship between tau conformation, phosphorylation, and aggregation. However, it is still ambiguous whether tau aggregation is toxic, what the mechanisms of toxicity are, and whether removal of aggregates is beneficial. Furthermore, efficient screening for tau aggregation inhibitors is not possible with mice or neuronal cell cultures derived from them. These questions can be addressed by inducible cell models where the tau expression can be switched on and off at defined time points. The creation of such cell models allows one to analyze the consequences of tau expression and aggregation and to search for the causes of toxicity and for suitable drugs. Alzheimer disease frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 lactate dehydrogenase paired helical filament tau repeat domain benzyloxycarbonyl fluoromethyl ketone phosphate-buffered saline wild type thioflavine S d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone. Alzheimer disease frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 lactate dehydrogenase paired helical filament tau repeat domain benzyloxycarbonyl fluoromethyl ketone phosphate-buffered saline wild type thioflavine S d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone. Here we describe N2a cell lines that allow the inducible expression of the repeat domain of tau, based on the Tet-On system (13Gossen M. Bujard H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 153-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Three variants of tauRD are expressed, the wild-type sequence, a pro-aggregation mutant (ΔK280), and an anti-aggregation mutant (containing additional proline residues). The cells show robust aggregation of tau, including Alzheimer-like paired helical filaments. The cells illustrate that the aggregation of tauRD is toxic and that removal of aggregates is beneficial. Fragmentation by a thrombin-like protease is a prelude to aggregation, whereas phosphorylation in the repeat domain bears no obvious relationship. Exposing the cells to inhibitor compounds reduces aggregation and toxicity, and even cells with aggregates are rescued again. Thus, the cell model will be useful in the search for drugs for AD and other tauopathies. Selection of an N2a, Tet-On, G418-resistant Cell Line—The N2a cells used here were characterized previously (14Biernat J. Wu Y.Z. Timm T. Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Mandelkow E. Meijer L. Mandelkow E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4013-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The cells were cotransfected both with pUHD172-1 plasmid (encoding the rtTA, obtained from H. Bujard, Heidelberg, Germany) and pEU-1 plasmid (encoding G418 resistance, a derivative of pRc/CMV; Invitrogen) (ratio 20:1; 1 μg/well of 6-well plates) using the N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts (DOTAP) transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% defined fetal bovine serum and subjected to G418 (600 μg/ml) and selection. The cells were fed with fresh media every 4 days for 3-4 weeks when single colonies appeared. Clones were tested for the induction level by transient transfection of the pUHG 16-3 plasmid, and the induction of β-galactosidase was measured. The pBI-5 plasmid was also transiently transfected into these cells, and the luciferase assay showed 230-fold induction. Generation of Inducible Tet-On Cell Lines—The DNA fragments encoding the appropriate constructs of the tau repeat domain (K18WT, K18ΔK280, and K18ΔK280/PP) were inserted into the bidirectional vector pBI-5 between ClaI and SalI restriction sites (pBI-5 is an unpublished derivative of pBI-2) (15Baron U. Freundlieb S. Gossen M. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 17: 3605-3606Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The pBI-5/K18-derived plasmids with pX343 (plasmid encoding the hygromycin resistance) were used for cotransfection of N2a/Tet-On, G418-resistant cells with the aid of N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts (DOTAP) (20:1 plasmid ratio; 1 μg/well of 6-well plates). The cells were seeded at 4 × 105 cells per well. The following day cells were transferred to 100 mm dishes and selected with 100 μg/ml hygromycin and 600 μg/ml G418. Clonal cell lines were screened for the inducible expression of K18 derivatives by measuring luciferase activity with the luciferase assay and immunofluorescence for tauRD protein with the polyclonal pan-tau antibody K9JA. Induction of K18 Derivatives in Tet-On N2a Cells—The inducible N2a/K18 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.1% nonessential amino acids. The expression of K18 constructs was induced by adding 1 μg of doxycycline per 1 ml of medium. The induction was continued for 7-11 days, and the medium was changed three times (always complemented with doxycycline). For solubility assays, the cells were collected by pelleting during centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The levels and solubility of K18ΔK280 were determined following Ref. 16Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar. The cells were homogenized (DIAX900, Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) in 10 volumes (w/v) of buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.8 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 10% sucrose. The homogenate was spun for 20 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was retained. The pellet was re-homogenized in 5 volumes of homogenization buffer and re-centrifuged. Both supernatants were combined, brought to 1% N-laurylsarcosinate (w/v), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature while shaken, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 ml/1 g of starting material. The supernatant and Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet samples were analyzed by Western blotting. The amount of material loaded for supernatant and Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet represented about 0.5 and 15% of the total material present in the supernatant and pellet, respectively (the ratio between supernatant and Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet was always 1:30). For quantification of tau levels in each fraction, the Western blots were probed with pan-tau antibody K9JA and analyzed by densitometry (LAS 3000 and AIDA software, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Quantitation of Aggregation of tauRD in Cells by Thioflavine S Staining—Tet-On inducible and undifferentiated N2a cells were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 5, 7, or 9 days in a culture dish. Then the cells were trypsinized and transferred to coverslips and incubated over-night. The cells on the coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, then permeabilized with 80% MeOH for 6 min at -20 °C, incubated with 0.1% thioflavine S for 5 min, and washed three times in ethanol (50%). The samples were incubated with antibody K9JA in 5% goat serum (PBS). The secondary anti-rabbit antibody labeled with Cy5 was also diluted with 5% goat serum in PBS and incubated for 45 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS, once with water, and mounted. Cells containing distinct ThS signals indicating the presence of insoluble aggregated material with β-pleated sheets were scored in many independent fields containing a total of 500 cells. Density Gradient Centrifugation—A discontinuous density gradient of the nonionic medium iodixanol was created by layering different concentrations of iodixanol in a centrifugation tube (from bottom to top: 850 μl of 50, 40, and 30%; 2.2 ml of 20%; 850 μl of 10%; and 300 μl of 5%). The samples were applied in a volume of 50 μl, and centrifugation was performed in a Sorvall TV865 rotor (Kendro Laboratory Products, Langenselbold, Germany) in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Optima 80K) for 3 h at 350,000 × g at 4 °C. Samples were released from the bottom of the tube by punctating the top and the bottom with a syringe, and droplets were collected. The numbering of fractions ranged from high to low density. Electron Microscopy—The protein solutions were placed on 600-mesh carbon-coated copper grids for 5 min. The grids were washed twice with PBS/albumin/buffer (1%, pH 7.4). For immunogold labeling, the grids were incubated on a drop of antibody/gold solution (prediluted 1:50 in PBS) for 1 h in a chamber with a water-saturated atmosphere. After washing two times with PBS and distilled water, the grids were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min. The specimens were examined in a Philips CM12 electron microscope at 100 kV (Eindhoven, Netherlands). For colloidal gold-antibody complexes, the colloidal sol was prepared by the reduction of tetrachloroauric acid by sodium citrate (17Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar). To form the gold-protein complex, 2.5 ml of gold sol and 500 μl of protein solution were mixed and stirred for 15 min. Bovine serum albumin was added to final concentration of 0.1% and stirred for an additional 10 min. The solution was centrifuged at 32,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the soft pellet was removed carefully. Isolation of Peptides and Mass Spectrometry—For mass spectrometry peptides were eluted from the polyacrylamide gels after Coomassie staining. The bands of interest were excised, and then the peptides were eluted (18Feick R.G. Shiozawa J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the gel pieces were cut into smaller pieces and totally destained by incubation in destaining solution (50 mm NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile) at room temperature under vigorous shaking. To replace the wash solution, the gel pieces were centrifuged in a benchtop centrifuge at 16,100 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed carefully by using gel loader tips. The gel pieces were then dehydrated by incubation in 100 μl of 100% acetonitrile for 15 min. After discarding the supernatant, the elution was started by adding at least 40 μl of extraction buffer (formic acid/acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol/H2O in a mixture of 50:25:15:10). Passive elution was carried out for 3 h at room temperature with vigorous shaking in a horizontal shaker (Eppendorf Thermomixer, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The supernatant was removed and pooled with the solution from a second round of elution carried out for 30 min. The gel pieces were dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile, and the supernatant was added to the pool of the elutions. The elution pool was dried, and the pellet was dissolved in 4 μl of a freshly prepared saturated matrix solution (sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid) for mass spectroscopy. This was performed with a surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry instrument (PBSI, Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA). The samples were applied to chips covered with a hydrophobic surface (H4 chips, Ciphergen Biosystems) without any further pretreatment of the target and dried at 37 °C. The measurement was performed in the positive ion mode with various settings of laser power and sensitivity.

N-terminal Sequencing—Peptides were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semidry blotting and briefly stained with Coomassie. After destaining with intensive destainer, the bands were cut out. The membranes were completely destained with 0.1% triethylamine in methanol for about 1-3 min. Afterward, the membrane pieces were washed twice with 100% methanol for 1 min by vortexing. The membrane pieces were then dried and used for N-terminal sequencing with a protein sequencer (4cl, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Neurotoxicity Assay—Neurotoxicity was assessed using an LDH assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The activity of LDH was measured spectrophotometrically at 492 nm. Cell death was calculated as percent of LDH released into medium, compared with total LDH obtained after total cell lysis. Toxicity values were determined in 1-day intervals. After N days of doxycycline-induced protein expression, the medium with 10% serum was exchanged for medium with 1% serum (after washing with PBS), and after 1 additional day the medium was collected for LDH determination. Aggregation and Inhibition Assay in Cells—The N2a/K18ΔK280 cells were grown in Nunc flasks in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with G418 (300 μg/ml) and hygromycin (100 μg/ml). The protein expression in the control sample was induced by addition of 1 μg/ml doxycycline (final concentration), and cells were incubated for 5 days. In the inhibition assay, the aggregation inhibitor compound was added together with doxycycline at a final concentration of 10 μm. After 5 days of protein expression, the cells were transferred to glass coverslips coated with polylysine, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and briefly permeabilized with 80% MeOH. Next the cells were incubated with 0.01% thioflavine S, followed by incubation with rabbit antibody K9JA and secondary anti-rabbit antibody labeled with Cy5. For assaying the dissolution of preformed tau aggregates, the inducible N2a cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 5 days. Then the medium was exchanged for new medium containing 1 μg/ml doxycycline and 10 μm of the inhibitor compound, and the incubation was continued for 2 more days. Transfer of cells onto coverslips and staining with ThS and tau antibody was performed as above. Finally, the cells showing ThS staining were scored in independent fields containing at least 500 cells. Identification of Proteases and Inhibitors—The protein fragments generated in N2a cells were determined by sequencing and mass spectrometry. For identification of the protease, N2a cells were incubated with different protease inhibitors as follows: caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, 40 μm (Promega, Mannheim, Germany); proteasome inhibitor MG132, 1 μm (Calbiochem); calpain inhibitor ALLN, 10 μm (Calbiochem); and thrombin inhibitor PPACK (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany). In particular, for testing thrombin inhibition in cells the expression of K18ΔK280 was induced by doxycycline in the presence of 10-100 μm PPACK, followed by analysis of fragments. For thrombin cleavage in vitro, K18ΔK280 (1 mg/ml) was incubated with purified human α-thrombin (Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT) at final concentrations of 1-10 units/μg tau. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The proteolytic reaction was stopped by Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were blotted and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. Constructs and Neuronal Cell Lines for Studying Expression and Aggregation of TauRD—Tau derivatives used for establishing inducible N2a cell lines were based on the 4-repeat tau construct K18, which comprises the domain that is essential for microtubule binding and for PHF aggregation (Fig. 1). The repeat domain forms the core of Alzheimer PHFs and can be assembled into bona fide PHFs in vitro (19Wischik C.M. Novak M. Edwards P.C. Klug A. Tichelaar W. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For studying the effect of aggregation, the mutation K18ΔK280 was particularly suitable because in vitro studies had shown a pronounced increase in the tendency to form β-structure and aggregation, even without polyanionic cofactors (21Barghorn S. Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Ackmann M. Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11714-11721Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This mutation is one of the tau mutations in a case of FTDP-17 (22Rosso S.M. van Swieten J.C. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2002; 5: 423-428Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As a control we generated the PP mutant with prolines inserted into each of the two hexapeptide motifs (I277P and I308P) that normally nucleate β-structure during aggregation. The prolines disrupt β-strands and thus inhibit aggregation (24von Bergen M. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To establish Tet-On inducible N2a cells, we first generated the host N2a clone with a stably integrated reversed tetracycline transactivator rtTA-S2 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (26Urlinger S. Baron U. Thellmann M. Hasan M.T. Bujard H. Hillen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Inducible cell lines were then generated by stable transfection of pBI-5 bifunctional vectors encoding the tauRD constructs and a reporter luciferase gene controlled by the Pbi-1 promoter. As a result, the following four cell lines were established: N2a/Tet-On/pBI-5 (mock), N2a/Tet-On/K18WT, N2a/Tet-On/K18ΔK280, and N2a/Tet-On/K18ΔK280/2P. The cells were selected for clones with the lowest background of luciferase activity and tauRD expression. A robust induction was obtained at doxycycline concentrations above ∼0.5 μg/ml. We therefore chose 1 μg/ml as a standard concentration for inducing tauRD expression. After 2 days of expression, the yield of 1 × 106 cells was comparable for the different constructs (∼1.6 μg for K18WT, 1.8 μg for K18ΔK280, and 1.2 μg for K18ΔK280-PP). Formation of PHF-like Aggregates in N2a Cells Expressing TauRD—One of the key questions of the experiments was the aggregation of tauRD and its effects on the cells. In principle, one could envisage various ways of how tauRD might affect cell behavior, e.g. overstabilization of microtubules and suppression of dynamics (27Bunker J.M. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), inhibition of microtubule-based transport (28Stamer K. Vogel R. Thies E. Mandelkow E.

A number of human diseases are caused by the pathogenic deposition of proteins in the form of amyloid-like fibrils (1Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Several non-pathogenic proteins and peptides also undergo amyloid like fibril formation on destabilization of their native state (7Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The fact that structurally and sequentially non-homologous proteins are able to self-assemble into fibrils possessing similar morphology (e.g. 10–18 nm width, birefringence to polarized light, and cross-β structure) suggests a common molecular mechanism in the fibrillation pathways. A variety of hypotheses for the mechanism of fibril formation have been proposed. Insulin is a 51-residue hormone with a largely α-helical structure. It exists as a mixture of hexameric, dimeric, and monomeric states in solution, with the relative population of different oligomeric species being strongly dependent on the environmental conditions: the protein is predominantly monomeric in 20% acetic acid, dimeric in 20 mm HCl, and hexameric at pH 7.5 in the presence of zinc. Insulin forms amyloid-like fibrils under a variety of conditions (11Burke M.J. Rougvie M.A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2435-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Waugh D.F. J. Am. Chem.

Insulin fibrils pose a variety of problems in biomedical and biotechnological applications. Amyloid deposits of insulin have been observed in patients with diabetes after repeated injection and in normal aging, as well as after subcutaneous insulin infusion (16Dische F.E. Wernstedt C.

In our previous work we have shown the important role of partially folded intermediates in insulin fibrillation in vitro (13Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6036-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 18Ahmad A. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8397-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In fact, our studies showed that insulin, which is a hexamer at physiological pH, undergoes rapid fibrillation starting at relatively low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride and urea. The predominant species characterized by various biophysical techniques under these conditions was shown to be a partially folded, expanded monomer, which is present in solutions containing up to 6 m guanidine hydrochloride or 8 m urea (18Ahmad A. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11404-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Ahmad A. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14999-15011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dissociation of the hexamer under these conditions was found to be the major rate-limiting step. Interestingly, in the presence of 20% acetic acid; i.e. under the conditions where insulin exists as a native monomer, the addition of guanidine hydrochloride was shown to result in the formation of a partially folded expanded conformation with high propensity to fibrillate (18Ahmad A. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11404-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the addition of urea under the same conditions slowed down the rate of fibrillation (∼5-fold at 0.75 m urea), which has been explained by the appearance of non-native conformation with significantly increased α-helical content compared with the native form of the protein (19Ahmad A. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14999-15011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It was very interesting to observe the effective formation of fibrils even at high denaturant concentration where the protein exists in an extensively unfolded conformation (18Ahmad A. Millett I.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 14999-15011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All these observations led us to assume that the pathway for insulin fibrillation can be described by a simple model hexamer → modified monomer → fibrils (13Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S.

Materials—Human insulin with zinc was kindly provided by Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark. All the chemicals were analytical grade, and were from EM Sciences or Sigma. Thioflavin T was obtained from Fluka. Preparation of Samples—Solutions of monomeric human insulin, 2 and 4 mg/ml, were freshly prepared in 20% acetic acid. The concentration of insulin was determined using an extinction coefficient of 1.0 for 1 mg/ml at 276 nm (14Nielsen L. Frokjaer S. Carpenter J.F. Brange J. J. Pharm. Sci. 2001; 90: 29-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Stock (1 mm) solutions of Thioflavin T were prepared by dissolving ThT in double-distilled water, and the concentration was determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 24,420 m–1 cm–1 at 420 nm. ThT was stored at 4 °C, protected from light. Incubation of Insulin for Fibrillation—500 μl of insulin, 2 or 4 mg/ml in 20% acetic acid, was incubated at 37 °C in a glass vial on a stirrer with a small magnetic bead spinning at the bottom of the vial at ∼600 rpm. Aliquots from this solution were taken at desired time intervals. ThT Assay for Determining Kinetics of Fibrillation—Free ThT has excitation and emission maxima at ∼350 and ∼450 nm, respectively. However, upon binding to fibrils the excitation and emission λmax change to ∼450 and ∼485 nm, respectively (21Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Analytical Biochemistry. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 22LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). 5-μl aliquots of sample were added to solution containing 20 μm ThT in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, shaken a few times before measuring the fluorescence emission on a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer from Instruments S.A., Inc. Jobin Yvon-Spex, at room temperature. A background fluorescence spectrum obtained by running a blank buffer was subtracted from each sample fluorescence spectrum. The excitation wavelength was 444 nm, and the emission was recorded at 482 nm. Fluorescence intensity at 482 nm was plotted against time, and the kinetic profiles were analyzed by curve fitting, using SigmaPlot software (18Ahmad A. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11404-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). ANS Fluorescence—5-μl aliquots from the incubated mixture were added to solutions containing 5 μm ANS in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and the fluorescence was measured with a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer at room temperature. The excitation wavelength was 350 nm, and the emission was measured at 460 nm. The values of fluorescence intensity at 462 nm and the values of maximal wavelength of the emission spectra were plotted against time. The profiles were fitted using curve fitting with SigmaPlot. Circular Dichroism—40 μl of the aliquot were placed in a cuvette with 0.1 mm path length, and CD spectra were collected on an AVIV 60DS CD spectrophotometer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) at 25 °C. A CD spectrum of the buffer was subtracted from the sample spectra for background correction. Spectra were recorded using a step size of 0.5 nm and a bandwidth of 1.5 nm. Phase diagrams were plotted as previously described (18Ahmad A. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11404-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Ahmad A. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14999-15011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). ATR-FTIR—FTIR spectra were recorded on a ThermoNicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrophotometer from 4000 to 400 cm–1 using a resolution of 2 cm–1 and an accumulation of 256 scans. 40 μl of the aliquot from the incubation mixture (4 mg/ml insulin at 37 °C with continuous stirring) was withdrawn at various intervals of time and spread uniformly on the surface of a germanium crystal using nitrogen to form a hydrated thin film. The system was continuously purged with dry nitrogen. Background and water vapor subtractions were performed until a straight baseline was obtained between 2000 and 1750 cm–1. Curve fitting of the amide I regions (raw spectra) was performed using GRAMS 32. Second derivative and Fourier self-deconvolved spectra were used as a peak position guide for the curve fitting procedure. The phase diagrams were plotted based on the extension of the concept described in the circular dichroism section above. H/D Exchange Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Measurements—The mass spectra were recorded on a Quattro II mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrimcham, UK) equipped with an electrospray ionization ion source. The sample solution was introduced into the ion source using a Harvard Apparatus model 11 syringe pump. To improve the sensitivity and stability of the ion beam, the source was operated at 80 °C. The electrospray capillary was set at 3.5 kV, and the cone voltage was 20 V. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizing and drying gas at a flow rate of 15 and 300 liters/h, respectively. The spectra were acquired and processed using MassLynx software supplied with the instrument. The mass spectrum was scanned from m/z 500 to 2200 in 6 s, and the spectra presented are averages of five spectra. The charge states were determined by MassLynx software, and the deconvolution of the spectra was carried out using MaxEnt software. Stock insulin solution of 10 mg/ml was prepared in 20% acetic acid. Aliquots from this were added to obtain final concentration of 4 mg/ml insulin in 20% acetic acid with 5, 10, and 60% of D2O, respectively. The samples were incubated for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h and diluted 100 times before injecting into the mass spectrometer. Monitoring Monomeric and Oligomeric Insulin by Dynamic Light Scattering—DLS measurements were performed at 20 °C using a DynaPro (Wyatt Technology) model 99-E-50 instrument. Aliquots of 10 μl of the incubation solution (4 mg/ml insulin at 37 °C) were centrifuged before measuring DLS. 1 μl of the supernatant was diluted with 10 μl of filtered 20% acetic acid buffer in the DLS cuvette, and measurements were taken within 3–7 min. Scattering peaks of <0.1 nm radius and more than 1000 nm were ignored. Changes in the conformation of insulin were monitored by a variety of probes during incubation of monomeric insulin under conditions leading to fibrillation. By starting with monomeric insulin complications due to associated states of native insulin (such as the hexamer or dimer) were avoided. The apparent pH of a 20% acetic acid solution is 1.8. Such low pHs are used in the commercial production of recombinant human insulin. Unless otherwise noted the experiments involved incubation of 4 mg/ml insulin in 20% acetic acid at 37 °C with continuous agitation. Fibril Formation Monitored by ThT Fluorescence—Thioflavin T is a fluorescent dye that is frequently used as a specific probe for fibril formation in vitro (21Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Analytical Biochemistry. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 22LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Changes in ThT emission at 482 nm as a function of time of insulin incubation in 20% acetic acid at 37 °C (i.e. conditions where insulin is known to be monomeric) with continuous shaking are shown in Fig. 1. The figure indicates that the increase in ThT fluorescence intensity follows a typical sigmoidal pattern both at 2.0 and 4.0 mg/ml insulin. The initial region with no significant changes in fluorescence corresponds to the nucleation phase, the region showing rapid increase in fluorescence is the elongation phase, and the final plateau region reflects the maturation phase of fibrillation. Analysis of the ThT curves showed that the fibrillation of protein at 4.0 and 2.0 mg/ml is characterized by lag times of 5.0 and 11.4 h, respectively. Thus at 2-fold higher protein concentrations the onset of fibrillation takes 2-fold shorter time than that at the lower concentration. The 2-fold higher fluorescence signal in the case of 4.0 mg/ml insulin solution also indicates a 2-fold higher quantity of fibrils. ANS Fluorescence—ANS is able to bind to solvent-exposed hydrophobic regions of proteins and has been widely used for the characterization of the partially folded intermediates (23Semisotnov G.V.

The kinetic profile of ANS binding to insulin at 4 mg/ml incubated under the conditions described above is shown in Fig. 2. At 0 h the emission intensity of ANS is very low with a maximum at 510 nm, which is characteristic of free ANS. At 2.5 h of incubation a sharp increase in the fluorescence intensity at 460 nm is observed, which is accompanied by a concomitant blue shift in emission λmax. These changes indicate an increase in the efficiency of ANS binding to insulin, suggesting that the protein undergoes structural changes giving rise to the appearance of solvent-exposed hydrophobic regions under these conditions. Interestingly, the blue shift of maximal ANS fluorescence reached its maximum (∼460 nm) after 6.0 h of incubation, whereas the increase in the ANS fluorescence intensity showed saturation only after 12.0 h (see Fig. 2). This indicates that well before the formation of any ThT-detectable fibrils, insulin begins to undergo a series of sequential structural changes, with transitions between 0 and 2.5, 2.5 and 6.0, and 6.0 and 12.0 h of incubation. H/D Exchange Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry has been used to measure H/D exchange of insulin (27Buijs J. Vera C.C. Ayala E. Steensma E. Hakansson P. Oscarsson S. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 3219-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Ramanathan R. Gross M.L. Zielinski W.L. Layloff T.P. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 5142-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar): the results showed that insulin undergoes H/D exchange by both fast (EX1) and slow (EX2) mechanisms. In our studies, we treated insulin with different concentrations of D2O in the presence of 20% acetic acid for different amounts of time as shown in TABLE ONE. No H/D exchange was observed in 5% D2O for as long as 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. In the presence of 10% D2O a slow exchange process was observed with 20 protons exchanging after 6 h of incubation. The exchange number did not change up to 24 h of incubation. However, 60% D2O resulted in fast (EX1) and slow (EX2) exchange processes: 40 protons were found to exchange rapidly on addition of D2O, and after incubation for 6 h, 10 more protons were found to undergo exchange by a slow process. These data suggest that proton exchange in monomeric insulin is significantly dependent on D2O concentration, and that prolonged incubation of the protein in high D2O concentrations shows the presence of at least 10 buried protons.TABLE ONEH/D exchange mass spectrometry of insulinD2OIncubation in D2OProtons exchanged%hH/D exchange for monomeric insulin5061224100612202420600406501250H/D exchange for aliquots from 4 mg/ml insulin incubated at 37 °C with continuous shakingD2OIncubation at 37 °C of aliquotsIncubation in D2OProtons exchanged%h50-2.50100-2.506000400.50401.50402.00402.5050 Open table in a new tab To detect changes (if any) of these buried protons during the aggregation process, aliquots of insulin (4.0 mg/ml, incubated at 37 °C with continuous stirring) were taken at regular intervals and then treated with the different concentrations of D2O. TABLE ONE shows that the addition of 5 and 10% D2O did not result in any exchange of insulin protons at any time point between 0 and 5 h of incubation. However, as expected, 40 protons exchanged at zero time with 60% D2O. The number of exchangeable protons did not change for up to 2.0 h of incubation. However, after incubation for 2.5 h, the extra 10 protons were found to undergo exchange. These observations clearly show that the structure of insulin is changed in such a way that the buried portion of the protein becomes exposed to the solvent at this point of incubation, presumably through formation of a partially unfolded conformation. ATR-FTIR Studies—Application of ATR-FTIR to study the process of protein aggregation has been reviewed (29Seshadri S. Khurana R. Fink A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 559-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30Fink A.L. Seshadri S. Khurana R. Oberg K.A. Singh B.R. Infrared Analysis of Peptides and Proteins. American Chemical Society, New York1999: 132-144Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that monomeric insulin is characterized by a peak at 1654 cm–1 characteristic of α-helical proteins, and that on conversion into fibrils the peak shifts to 1628 cm–1, consistent with the high β-structure content of the fibrils (31Wei J. Xie L. Lin Y.Z. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Wei J.A. Lin Y.Z. Zhou J.M. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Fig. 3A shows ATR-FTIR spectra of insulin measured at various intervals of incubation. Plots of absorbance against time of incubation (Fig. 3B) show that only very small changes in the spectral shape and intensity take place for the first 2.5 h of incubation. Two transitions involving significant increases in intensity at 1628 cm–1 (mirrored by decreases at 1654 cm–1) were observed starting at 2.5 and 8 h of incubation, and at longer times (>10 h) a steady increase in intensity at 1628 cm–1, with a concomitant decrease in the intensity at 1654 cm–1, was observed. The latter change reflects the conversion of soluble α-helical forms of insulin into β-structure-enriched fibrils. At 28 h of incubation the β-sheet composition was ∼52% as calculated from the FTIR spectrum. These observations indicate the existence of stepwise changes in insulin secondary structure during the process of insulin fibrillation. To better account for these changes, we performed curve fitting of the FTIR spectra. Curve fitting of the native protein at 0 h of incubation shows the existence of a variety of secondary structural elements as shown in TABLE TWO and Fig. 4. The same set of secondary structural components was observed for the 2.5-h spectrum. However, dramatic changes in secondary structure content were observed between 2.5 and 3.0 h of incubation (Fig. 4 and TABLE TWO). Although it is very difficult to delineate between intramolecular unfolding and the intermolecular association from FTIR spectra, one thing that the fitting data clearly shows is the loss of most of the secondary structural elements belonging to the native monomer during this small interval of time. This is strong evidence for the formation of a partially unfolded intermediate of the insulin monomer before any fibrillation has taken place. At longer times of incubation the FTIR spectra are dominated by the contributions of β-structure (at 1628 cm–1). Based on the results of dynamic light scattering (see below) we attribute the first transition, between 2.5 and 5 h to formation of soluble oligomers resulting from rapid association of a putative transiently partially unfolded conformation, and the second transition, from 7 to 11 h to formation of a second oligomeric intermediate, as well as concomitant fibril formation.TABLE TWOSecondary structure elements from FTIR analysis of insulin as a function of time of incubation0 h2.5 h3.0 h28.0 hcm-11693.41694.51687.71690.11689.11684.116781675.81676.716651664.716691665.516541654.616531644.21643.916391638.71638.11633.31633.316251624.71627.61626.916181614.416131613.916101606.316041603.501602.60 Open table in a new tab Circular Dichroism Spectra—Far-UV CD spectra have been used as a fingerprint region for the identification of various secondary structural elements. Far-UV CD spectra obtained for insulin at various times of incubation are shown in Fig. 5. The CD spectrum measured for the sample before the beginning of incubation has double minima at 208 and 222 nm, which is characteristic of α-helical structure (the spectrum also shows evidence for β-sheet, hence the helical signature is not so distinct). Spectra obtained from samples incubated up to 2 h do not exhibit any significant difference from the native monomer. However, after 3 h of incubation the spectral shape starts to change. This finding supports the abovementioned observations that major changes in insulin structure occur between 2 and 3 h, and well before any fibrillation takes place. The spectrum obtained at 6 h shows more β-sheet than α-helical structure, with a single minimum observing at ∼217 nm. After 8 h of incubation the spectrum resembles that of predominant β structure. Further incubation of insulin results only in an increase of β content. The analysis of CD data in"

Unfortunately, the efficiency of current trans-splicing vectors is very low. Here we show that rational design of the gene splitting site has a profound influence on trans-splicing vector-mediated gene expression. Using mRNA accumulation as a guide, we generated a set of efficient trans-splicing vectors and achieved widespread expression of the 6-kb DeltaH2-R19 mini-dystrophin gene in skeletal muscle of mdx mice, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The dystrophic phenotype was ameliorated in both adult and aged mice. This demonstrates the use of trans-splicing vectors to efficiently express a large therapeutic structural protein. This strategy should be applicable to other large therapeutic genes or large transcription regulatory elements."

Biragyn A. Kwak L.W. Oppenheim J.J. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 291-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). They constitute a first line of host defense against pathogens in plants and animals (2Bulet P. Stocklin R. Menin L. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 3Boman H.G. J. Intern. Med. 2003; 254: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). We estimate that more than 1000 antimicrobial peptides have been described at the level of their primary structure (2Bulet P. Stocklin R. Menin L. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). They are gathered in the Antimicrobial Sequence Database (www.bbc-m.units.it/∼tossi/amsdb.html). AMPs can be classified into three major groups: (i) linear peptides that form amphipathic α-helices, (ii) cyclic peptides containing cysteine-residue engaged in disulfide bonds, and (iii) peptides with an overrepresentation in certain amino acids (proline, arginine, glycine, or histidine). Despite their great diversity in terms of size, primary structure, amino acid composition, and mode of action, most AMPs are characterized by the preponderance in cationic and hydrophobic amino acids (2Bulet P. Stocklin R. Menin L. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). In most of the cases, this amphipathic character is considered as crucial for the interaction of the effective peptide with the membrane of sensitive microorganisms. This first interaction seems to be essential whatever the exact mode of action: (i) through disruption of their negatively charged cytoplasmic membranes or (ii) through killing following translocation into the bacteria without membrane lyses and binding to a specific target protein (4Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar). Depending on their tissue distribution, AMPs ensure either a systemic or a local protection of the organism against pathogens. antimicrobial peptide C. gigas defensin distance geometry two-dimensional double-quantum filter correlation spectroscopy matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry electrospray ionization mass spectrometry nuclear Overhauser effect two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography root mean square deviation total correlation spectroscopy reverse transcriptase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase minimum inhibitory concentration elongation factor Institut Francais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer colony forming units. antimicrobial peptide C. gigas defensin distance geometry two-dimensional double-quantum filter correlation spectroscopy matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry electrospray ionization mass spectrometry nuclear Overhauser effect two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography root mean square deviation total correlation spectroscopy reverse transcriptase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase minimum inhibitory concentration elongation factor Institut Francais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer colony forming units. Among the AMPs, defensins represent an important peptide family. They are abundant and widely distributed in human and animal tissues that are involved in host defense against microbial infection. Defensins are compact cationic peptides, ∼3–5 kDa in size, containing three or four disulfide bridges, and are active against a wide range of bacteria and fungi (5Boulanger N. Lowenberger C. Volf P. Ursic R. Sigutova L. Sabatier L. Svobodova M. Beverley S.M. Spath G. Brun R. Pesson B. Bulet P. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 7140-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The vertebrate defensins can be grouped into three subfamilies, the α-defensins and β-defensins, which are distinguished on the basis of the connectivity of their six cysteine residues, and more recently the cyclic θ-defensins, (6Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5707-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). The α-defensins are produced constitutively and stored in neutrophils of many animals and in human Paneth cells. β-Defensins, which have been identified in many cell types, including epithelial cells and neutrophils, were reported to be inducible or constitutively expressed (3Boman H.G. J. Intern. Med. 2003; 254: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 7Izadpanah A. Gallo R.L. J. Am. Acad.

Lett. 2002; 206: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, apart from their antimicrobial activities, defensins play an important role in inflammation, wound healing, and regulation of specific immunity reactions (9Sima P. Trebichavsky I. Sigler K. Folia. Microbiol. (Praha). 2003; 48: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast with the classification of the vertebrate defensins, based on their secondary structure, the grouping in clear distinct subfamilies of the invertebrate defensins is based on their biological properties, antibacterial versus antifungal (2Bulet P. Stocklin R. Menin L. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The invertebrate defensins differ from the vertebrate defensins by their disulfide bridging, (10Dimarcq J.-L. Bulet P. Hétru C. Fofmann J.A. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Defensins are the most widespread family of invertebrate AMPs, and >70 different defensins have been isolated in arthropods (insects, ticks, spiders, and scorpions) and mollusks (2Bulet P. Stocklin R. Menin L. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Most of the insect defensins were isolated from the hemolymph of experimentally infected animals, whereas in scorpions, termites, and mollusks, defensins are present in granular hemocytes of non-infected animals (2Bulet P. Stocklin R. Menin L. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). In mollusks, AMPs have only been reported in bivalves, such as in the mussels Mytilus edulis (11Charlet M. Chernysh S. Philippe H. Hétru C. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21808-21813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and Mytilus galloprovincialis (12Mitta G. Vandenbulcke F. Roch P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Interestingly, defensins from the Mediterranean mussels have been found to display sequence homology to defensins from arthropods, even though they belong to distant phylogenetic groups. Until now, in oyster, antimicrobial activities have been detected in the hemolymph of some species, however, AMPs have never been fully characterized despite many attempts to purify, from hemolymph and other tissues, such molecules by using RP-HPLC approaches (13Bachère E. Gueguen Y. Gonzalez M. de Lorgeril J. Garnier J. Romestand B. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 198: 149-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the characterization of the first AMP in oyster. The Crassostrea gigas defensin (Cg-Def) mRNA has been isolated from mantle edge using the expressed sequence tag approach. Cg-Def displays sequence homology with members of the arthropod defensin family and shares with the defensins (MGD-1 and -2) from the mussel M. galloprovincialis, a fourth pair of cysteine residues. To shed light on the evolutionary conservation of defensins in invertebrates and the function of this peptide in the defense reactions of the oyster, we expressed Cg-Def in Escherichia coli and determined, using the refolded peptide, its spectrum of activity against a panel of bacteria and fungi. To draw some structure-function features, the three-dimensional structure of the Cg-Def was determined in aqueous solution by 1H NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling, and then compared with MGD-1, its counterpart from mussels. Finally, the Cg-Def gene expression was analyzed in response to experimental bacterial challenge of oysters. Animals and RT-PCR Amplification of Cg-def—Adult oysters, C. gigas, were purchased from a local oyster farm in Normandie (France) or Palavas (Gulf of Lion, France) and kept in seawater at 15 °C. A cDNA encoding part of a putative defensin was identified by randomly sequencing clones from a C. gigas mantle edge cDNA library constructed in λ-ZAP II (University of Caen). Specific primers were then used to isolate the full-length Cg-def cDNA from the same library. Briefly, the 5′ missing end of the transcript was identified using the orientated C. gigas mantle edge cDNA library as template and using a gene-specific oligonucleotide (Cg-DefR1: 5′-ACCAGAGCGTGGCTGCATCACAG-3′) and a vector-specific oligonucleotide (T3: 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGG-3′) as primers. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel. Fragment of the expected size was extracted from the gel using a Qiagen kit, cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector using a TA cloning kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced. Screening of C. gigas Genomic Library—A genomic library of C. gigas was constructed in λ-DASHII (Stratagene). A total of 1.8 × 106 independent clones was recovered. After amplification to 4.5 × 1010 plaqueforming units/ml, 2.5 × 105 recombinant λ-DASH phages were plated at 5 × 104 per dish, adsorbed to nitrocellulose membranes, and screened at high stringency with digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled 322-bp encoding the full-length Cg-def cDNA. Positive clones were purified (Qiagen λ kit, Courtaboeuf, France) and subjected to restriction analysis and Southern blot hybridization using the original probe to confirm that the λ-DASH clones contained Cg-def-specific sequence. Genomic organization of positive clones was subsequently determined by direct sequencing. Exon/intron boundaries were determined by comparing the genomic sequence to the corresponding cDNA one. Determination of Cg-def Expression in Different Tissues—Total RNA was isolated from adult tissues using Tri reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After treatment during 20 min at 37 °C with 1 unit of DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent genomic DNA contamination, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using 1 μg of random hexanucleotidic primers (Promega), 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 37 °C for 1 h in the appropriate buffer. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min. Then, quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using the iCycler apparatus (Bio-Rad). iQ™ SYBR Green supermix PCR kit (Bio-Rad) was used for real-time monitoring of amplification (5 ng of template cDNA, 40 cycles: 95 °C/15 s, 60 °C/15 s) with the following primers: QsDef, 5′-CCACAATCACTGCAAGTCCATTA-3′ and QaDef, 5′-CTTTCCATTACAATCGGTACATG-3′ as sense and antisense primers, respectively. Accurate amplification of the target amplicon was checked by performing a melting curve. Using QsGAPDH (5′-TTCTCTTGCCCCTCTTGC-3′) and QaGAPDH (5′-CGCCCAATCCTTGTTGCTT-3′) primers, a parallel amplification of oyster GAPDH transcript (EMBL CGI548886) was carried out to normalize the expression data of the Cg-def transcript. The relative level of Cg-def expression is calculated for 100 copies of the GAPDH housekeeping gene following the formula: n = 100 × 2(Ct GAPDH – Ct Cg-Def). Recombinant Expression of Cg-Def—Recombinant Cg-Def was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein using the pET-28a system (Novagen, Madison, WI). By PCR amplification, a Met-coding trideoxynucleotide was incorporated 5′ of the Cg-def cDNA and cloned in-frame with the N-terminal His6 in the EcoRI/SalI sites of pET-28a. The Cg-def coding cDNA sequence was amplified by PCR using forward primer DefFw1 (5′-GCGCGAATTCATGGGATTTGGGTGTCCGGG) paired with reverse primer DefRv1 (5′-ATATATGTCGACTTACTTCTTTCCATTACAATCGG). The reaction was performed by incubating the reaction mixtures at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by successive cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 26 cycles using Isis™ DNA polymerase (Qbiogene). The underlined codon in the forward primer denotes a Met codon to incorporate a CNBr cleavage site immediately upstream of the N terminus of the designed peptide according to the method described for recombinant mouse α-defensin production (14Satchell D.P. Sheynis T. Kolusheva S. Cummings J. Vanderlick T.K. Jelinek R. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Peptides. 2003; 24: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recombinant Cg-Def was expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) transformed with the pET-28a/Cg-Def construct. The cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 0.9 in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (10 g of bacto-Tryptone, 5 g of bacto yeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl) supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Expression of fusion proteins was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After growth at 37 °C for 3 h, bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C. The cells were lysed by resuspending bacteria pellets in 6 m guanidine HCl in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, followed by sonication at 40% amplitude for 2 min using a Vibra cell Sonifier 450 (Branson Ultrasons, Annemasse, France). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation in a Sorvall SA-600 rotor at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C prior to protein purification. Purification and Folding of Recombinant Cg-Def—His-tagged Cg-Def fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography by incubating cell lysates with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Novagen) at a ratio of 25:1 (v/v) in 6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) for 4 h at 4°C. Fusion proteins were eluted with two column volumes of 6 m guanidine HCl, 1 m imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.4), dialyzed against 5% acetic acid (HOAc) in SpectraPor dialysis membranes (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez), and lyophilized. The methionine residue introduced at the Cg-Def N terminus was subjected to CNBr cleavage by dissolving the lyophilized His6 fusion proteins in 50% formic acid, addition of solid CNBr to 10 mg/ml (final concentration), and incubation of the mixtures for 8 h in the darkness at 25 °C. The cleavage reaction was terminated by adding 10 volumes of water, followed by freezing and lyophilization. Then, the cleaved fusion peptide mixture was reduced in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8 in the presence of 100 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture was purified to homogeneity using a C8 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and the fractions of interest were lyophilized. The peptide was resolved with a 0–55% acetonitrile gradient developed over 30 min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min on a UP10C8 column (Interchrom modulocart uptisphere 10 C8, 250 × 10 mm). The refolding of the Cg-Def was performed at room temperature in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8 during 48 h. Then, the refolded Cg-Def was purified to homogeneity using an additional RP-HPLC step using the same column and eluting conditions as mentioned above. Alternatively, the cleaved fusion peptide mixture was directly folded at pH 8.1 in a buffer solution containing 0.1 m NaHCO3 and 3 mm reduced and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione in the presence of 2 m urea and 25% N,N-dimethylformamide (15Wu Z. Powell R. Lu W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2402-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Then, the folded Cg-Def was purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC using a C8 column, as described above. Peptide purity was controlled by acid-urea PAGE, and the peptide concentration was estimated by amino acid analysis and UV absorption at 280 nm based on the extinction coefficients of the molecule. Molecular masses of the purified peptides were determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mode mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Antimicrobial Assays—Antimicrobial activity of recombinant Cg-Def was assayed against several bacteria, including the Gram-positive Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus aureus, S. hemeolyticus, Bacillus megaterium, Brevibacterium stationi, Microbacterium maritypicum, the Gram-negative E. coli 363, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Salmonella typhimurium. The activity of the peptide was also investigated against the following filamentous fungi Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea, and Penicillium crustosum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in duplicate by the liquid growth inhibition assay based on the procedure described by Hetru and Bulet (16Hetru C. Bulet P. Shafer W.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. 78. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 35-49Google Scholar). Poor broth (PB: 1% bacto-Tryptone, 0.5% NaCl w/v, pH 7.5) nutrient medium was used for standard bacteria, and saline peptone water (1.5% peptone, 1.5% NaCl, pH 7.2) was used for marine bacteria. Antifungal assay was performed in potato dextrose broth (Difco, Sparks, MD) at half strength supplemented with tetracycline (10 μg/ml final concentration). Growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 620 nm on a Multiscan microplate reader colorimeter (Dynatech). Bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect was measured by CFU counting following a 15-h incubation at 30 °C. A bactericidal kinetic was assayed with M. lysodeikticus. Ten microliters of purified peptide, at a concentration 10 times over the MIC value, was mixed with 90 μl of an exponential phase culture of M. lysodeikticus at a starting A600 of 0.01 in PB nutrient medium and incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots of 10 μl were plated after 0 min, 2 min, 10 min, 90 min, and 15 h of incubation on nutrient agar plates. The number of CFUs was established after a 15-h incubation at 30 °C. As a control, the bacterial culture was incubated with 10 μlof sterile water. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples of Cg-Def were prepared either in a 95:5 H2O:D2O mixture (v/v) or in 99.98% D2O to yield a 0.6–0.8 mm solutions. The pH was adjusted to the desired values by addition of deuterated HCl or NaOD and measured at room temperature with a 3-mm electrode. They are given uncorrected for the deuterium isotopic effect. Proton chemical shifts were referenced with respect to sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate according to the IUPAC recommendations. 1H NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance cryoprobe, and spectra were recorded in the temperature range of 10–30 °C. In all experiments, the carrier frequency was set at the center of the spectrum at the water frequency. Double-quantum filtered-correlated spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) (17Rance M. Sorensen O.W.

Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the States-TPPI (time proportional phase incrementation) method (22Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar). For spectra recorded in H2O, the water resonance was suppressed by the WATERGATE method (23Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3509) Google Scholar), except for the DQF-COSY spectra where a low power irradiation was used. The z-TOCSY spectra were obtained with a mixing time of 90 ms and NOESY spectra with mixing times of 100, 150, and 300 ms. Data were processed by using the XWINNMR software. The full sequential assignment was achieved using the general strategy described by Wüthrich (24Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). To identify the slow exchanging amide protons, the sample was dissolved in D2O at 25 °C, and first a TOCSY (80 mn) and then an NOESY (180 mn) experiment was recorded for their identification. Structure Calculation and Analysis—The NOESY cross-peaks were measured from two NOESY spectra (pH 3.25, at 20 and 25 °C) with a mixing time of 150 ms, and subsequently divided into five classes, according to their intensities. Very strong, strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOEs were then converted into 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 5.0 Å distance constraints, respectively. The ϕ angle restraints were derived from the 3JNH-CαH coupling constants, and the χ1 angle restraints were derived from the combined analysis of the 3JHα-Hβ,β′ coupling constants and intra-residues NOEs, respectively. To calculate the three-dimensional structures, distance and dihedral angle restraints were used as input in the DYANA program that uses simulated annealing combined with molecular dynamics in torsion angle space (25Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar). In the first stage of the calculation, an initial ensemble of 20 structures was generated from a template structure with randomized ϕ,ψ dihedral angles and extended side chains. In preliminary calculations, neither hydrogen bond nor disulfide bond was used as restraint. Hydrogen bonds were considered as present if the distance between heavy atoms was less than 3.5 Å and the donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle was greater than 120°. Finally, to calculate the Cg-Def three-dimensional structure, 456 NOE-derived distances and 13 dihedral constraints, including the cis conformation of the Cys4–Pro5 amide bond (ω = 0°) and the disulfide bonds were used as input. A calculation of 60 conformers was carried out, and the resulting 10 structures with a minimum of restrained violations (no violation of >0.3 Å) were analyzed with INSIGHT 97 (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, CA). The Ramachandran analysis was performed with PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4367) Google Scholar), and the limits of the secondary structure elements and the van der Waals surfaces were determined with STRIDE (27Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1995; 23: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). The chemical shifts and coordinates of Cg-Def are deposited in the BioMagResBank (BMRB entry: 6849) and the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry: 2B68), respectively. Analyses of C. gigas Mantle by RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS—Mantle tissue from 200 bacteria-challenged C. gigas oysters was collected, rapidly frozen with liquid nitrogen, and ground to fine powder. Then, the mantle sample was diluted in 10% acetic acid, homogenized using an ultra-turax, and left at 4 °C under gentle stirring for 15 h. Extracts were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was prepurified by solid-phase extraction on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Associates) equilibrated with acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). After washing with acidified water, peptides were eluted with 100% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The Sep-Pak fraction was then lyophilized, reconstituted in ultrapure water, and loaded onto a C8-reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on an UP10C8 column (Interchrom modulocart uptisphere 10 C8, 250 × 10 mm), and elution was performed using a 0–55% acetonitrile gradient developed over 30 min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions were hand collected, lyophilized, resuspended in 100 μl of ultrapure water, and then assayed for antimicrobial activity. Finally, the active fractions were purified in a third step by C18 RP-HPLC, on a Symmetry Shield RP18 column (Waters, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250) using a 0–45% acetonitrile gradient developed over 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The corresponding fractions were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Bacterial Challenge and Quantification of Cg-def Gene Expression—Adult C. gigas oysters were stimulated by bath with heat-killed bacteria (5 × 108 bacteria/liter). The stimulation was performed with three bacterial species, M. lysodeikticus, Vibrio splendidus, and V. anguillarum. The bacterial strains were grown separately overnight, in saline peptone water at 25 °C for Vibrio strains and in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium for M. lysodeikticus (30 °C). Bacteria were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min) and suspended in fresh growth medium. Bac"

Using lung sections from patients with IPF, we previously demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that the biologically active conformation of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a potent fibrogenic cytokine, is expressed in epithelial cells lining honeycomb cysts in areas of advanced disease and remodeling (7Khalil N.

In regions of the lung where fibroblast foci are present, the biologically active conformation of TGF-β1 is observed in the hyperplastic pneumocytes overlying the fibroblast foci (7Khalil N.

Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in lung sections with no evidence of inflammation or fibrosis do not express the active conformation of TGF-β1. Based on our observations in IPF lungs demonstrating that AECs that line areas of fibrosis and fibroblast foci aberrantly express biologically active TGF-β1, we designed an in vitro model to determine the role of AEC-derived TGF-β1 in interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and parenchymal remodeling (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this model, we used slices of normal rat lungs, which were free of inflammatory cells. The AECs in the explanted lung slices were successfully transfected with the retrovirus pMX carrying an insert of TGF-β1 designated as L-s223,225-TGF-β1 (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The L-s223,225-TGF-β1 cDNA contains a mutation in the TGF-β1 gene in which Cys223 and Cys225 have been substituted with serines (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This mutation results in constitutive release of biologically active TGF-β1 (23Sakamoto R. Nitta T. Kamikawa Y. Kono S. Sugihara K. Tsuyama S. Murata F. Med. Electron Microsc. 2002; 35: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Retroviruses such as pMX enter only actively proliferating cells (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To selectively transfect the AECs of the explant, the explants were treated with keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a potent AEC mitogen (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled probe of the puromycin resistance gene contained in the pMX retrovirus confirmed that, in the presence of KGF, only AECs of the explant were transfected with the vector (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In lung explants in which the AECs were successfully transfected with the L-s223,225-TGF-β1 gene, there was release of active TGF-β1 and extensive fibrosis with lesions that resembled fibroblast foci and honeycomb cysts (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The main sources of connective tissue proteins are fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (11Eckes B. Zigrino P. Kessler D. Holtkotter O. Shephard P. Mauch C. Krieg T. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which are increased in pMX-L-s223,225-TGF-β1-transfected explants (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the release of active TGF-β1 by AECs in this model directly or indirectly regulates the proliferation of interstitial pulmonary fibroblasts. Because the appearance of fibroblasts (especially in fibroblast foci) is associated with the pathogenesis of IPF and correlates with progression of fibrosis in IPF (5Flaherty K.R. Colby T.V.

In this study, we demonstrate that fibroblasts obtained from lung tissue of explants with successful transfection of AECs with pMX-L-s223,225-TGF-β1 compared with control fibroblasts proliferated actively. However, when fibroblasts were obtained from transfected explants that were cultured with antibody to TGF-β1 or fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), DNA synthesis was decreased. Primary lung fibroblasts obtained from normal rat lungs cultured with TGF-β1 caused an almost immediate release of extracellular FGF-2 and expression of increased quantities of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and JNK; but in the presence of antibody to FGF-2, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK was totally abrogated. TGF-β inhibited proliferation of epithelial and hematopoietic cells by suppression of c-Myc and induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) p15INK46, p21CIP1, and p27KIP. Fibroblasts cultured with TGF-β1 showed no regulation of c-Myc, p15INK46, p21CIP1, or p27KIP. These findings suggest that TGF-β1 regulates the proliferation of pulmonary fibroblasts indirectly by the release of FGF-2, which, by induction of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK, leads to fibroblast proliferation. Furthermore, fibroblasts do not respond to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β1 by suppression of c-Myc and induction of CKIs p15INK46, p21CIP1, and p27KIP.

Preparation of the Retroviral Vector—pPK9A (a gift from Dr. Lalage Wakefield, Laboratory of Chemoprevention, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) is a plasmid that contains the entire length of the cDNA of TGF-β1 with Cys223 and Cys225 substituted with serines (12Brunner A.M. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13660-13664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substitution of cysteines with serines at these positions results in secretion of TGF-β1 in its biologically active form (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Brunner A.M. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13660-13664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this cDNA was named L-s223,225-TGF-β1 (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Using BglII digestion, the 1.2-kb TGF-β1 was isolated and purified with a DNA gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga) (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). L-s223,225-TGF-β1 was subcloned into the retroviral vector pMX (a gift from Dr. Alice Mui, Department of Surgery, University of British Columbia) (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The pMX retrovirus with no TGF-β1 cDNA was designated as pMX, whereas the retrovirus containing the TGF-β1 gene was designated as pMX-L-s223,225-TGF-β1 (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The retroviruses were produced using the packaging cell line Plat-E, followed by quantitation based on the number of infected NIH/3T3 cells (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Preparation of Normal Rat Lung Slices—Female Sprague-Dawley rats that were free of respiratory disease and that weighed 200–250 g were purchased from the University of British Columbia Vivarium. Intraperitoneal administration of 0.4 ml of ketamine (Biomedia-MTC, Cambridge, Ontario) and 0.2 ml of Rompun (Bayer, Etobicoke, Ontario) was used for euthanization. The trachea was exposed, and an 18-gauge catheter was inserted through the cartilaginous rings. After exposure of the thoracic and abdominal cavities, the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta were severed. The peripheral blood was removed with 10 ml of normal saline injected into the right ventricle until the lungs turned white. The trachea and lungs were taken out. To remove alveolar cells, the lungs were lavaged with 50–60 ml of warm normal saline through the trachea and then infused with 5 ml of 0.4% agarose/DMEM (2× solution of 1:1 serum-free DMEM and 0.8% agarose (Invitrogen)) at 40 °C. The medium was supplemented with hydrocortisone (0.2 μg/ml), retinol acetate (0.2 μg/ml), and 0.02% insulin-transferrin-sodium selenium. A thread was used to tie the tracheas, and lungs were placed on culture dishes on ice overnight to further solidify the lungs. The lungs were sliced manually at 1–2-mm thickness from each lobe with a sterilized scalpel (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In some instances, alveolar macrophages were isolated from the lavage fluid, cultured as described previously (7Khalil N. O'Connor R.N. Flanders K.C. Unruh H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and stained with vimentin. Culture of Rat Lung Slices—1.5 ml of warm 0.4% agarose/DMEM was added to each 6-well plate. After the agarose/DMEM solidified, four to six lung slices were placed on top of the agarose, and 1.5 ml of serum-free DMEM supplemented with hydrocortisone (0.2 μg/ml), retinol acetate (0.2 μg/ml), and 0.02% insulin-transferrin-sodium selenium was added. The lung slices were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The medium was changed twice each week, and lung slices were turned every other day and collected after culture. Treatment of the lung slices consisted of medium, KGF (25 ng/ml), pMX (106 TCID50), or pMX-L-s223,225-TGF-β1 (106 TCID50) + KGF (25 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of neutralizing anti-TGF-β1 antibody (0.1 μg/ml), fetuin (10 μm), anti-FGF-2 antibody (4.5 μg/ml), anti-IGF-1 antibody (5 μg/ml), or anti-PDGF antibody (5 μg/ml). Fetuin was used under some conditions because, as a glycoprotein, it can associate with TGF-β1 and prevent TGF-β1 from binding to TGF-β1 receptor (TβR) II and mediating a signal (13Demetriou M. Binkert C. Sukhu B. Tenenbaum H.C. Dennis J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12755-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). KGF was used because retroviruses transfect only proliferating cells and because it is an AEC mitogen that induces only AEC proliferation in lung explants (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Wang G. Slepushkin V.A. Bodner M. Zabner J. van Es H.H.G Thomas P. Jolly D.J. Davidson B.L. McCray P.B. J. Gene Med. 1999; 1: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Quantitation of TGF-β1 by ELISA—The TGF-β1 present in the conditioned medium was quantitated using an ELISA kit designed to detect only biologically active TGF-β1 that is not associated with lamin-associated polypeptide-1 (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 15Chen G. Grotendorst G. Eichholtz T. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L548-L556PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chen G. Khalil N. Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2002; 132: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine the quantity of the total TGF-β1 in the sample, an aliquot of the conditioned media was acidified to remove latency-associated polypeptide-1 from any latent TGF-β1 (L-TGF-β1) present in the conditioned medium. The same conditioned medium was neutralized and used in the ELISA to determine the total TGF-β1 present in the sample. Preparation of Fibroblast Cultures—In the explant model, the release of TGF-β1 in the conditioned medium overlying the explants was detected in maximal quantities 7 days after transfection, but was barely detectable 14 days after transfection and was not detected in the conditioned medium 21 and 28 days after transfection (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). After 14 days, the explant lung tissue demonstrated maximal fibroblast and myofibroblast numbers and connective tissue synthesis, suggesting that, 14 days after the release of TGF-β1, there is a maximal expansion of fibroblasts (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For this reason, it was expected that the isolation of fibroblasts from the explant 14 days after transfection of AECs was likely to be the ideal time interval from the release of TGF-β1 to obtain fibroblasts. 14 days after transfection, the explanted lung slices were cut manually into small pieces (∼0.5 mm3), placed on culture dishes, and cultured with DMEM in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Fibroblasts were observed to grow out from the explant 7 days later. At this time, the pieces of lung explant were discarded, and the fibroblasts were obtained by trypsinization and plated in equal numbers on culture dishes for 6 weeks. The control fibroblasts were obtained from lung explants cultured in medium, pMX with no TGF-β1 insert, or KGF. In some instances, fibroblasts were obtained from explants transfected with pMX-L-s223,225-TGF-β1 but also cultured with fetuin (10 μm) or antibody to TGF-β1 (0.1 μg/ml), FGF-2 (4.5 μg/ml), IGF-1 (5 μg/ml), or PDGF (5 μg/ml). For some experiments, fibroblasts from untreated explants were cultured with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of anti-FGF-2 (4.5 μg/ml), anti-IGF-1 (5 μg/ml), or anti-PDGF (5 μg/ml) antibody or an inhibitor of MAPK activation (SB203580 (10 μm), PD98059 (40 μm), or SP60025 (20 μm)). The fibroblasts were then used for [3H]thymidine incorporation or Western analysis. Vimentin Staining of Rat Lung Tissue and Fibroblasts in Culture—Rat lung tissue pieces and/or fibroblasts were fixed in -10 °C methanol. After air-drying, the cells and/or lung sections were incubated with 3% H2O2 in methanol and then washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween. The slides were incubated with universal blocking solution and incubated with anti-vimentin antibody (1:80 dilution) for 30 min. The slides were washed twice with TBS/Tween, incubated with biotinylated, rat-absorbed rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:300 dilution) for 20 min, and rinsed in TBS/Tween. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was applied to lung tissue pieces and/or fibroblasts for 20 min, washed with TBS/Tween, and incubated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromogen for 5 min. The slides were rinsed in distilled water, counterstained with hematoxylin or stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and mounted in aqueous permanent mounting medium. Extraction and Quantitation of FGF-2—To release and quantitate extracellular FGF-2 in fibroblast cultures, the fibroblasts were washed with DMEM and then incubated with 0.25 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 2 m NaCl for 2 min (17Murakami-Mori K. Mori S. Nakamura S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1694-1704PubMed Google Scholar). The FGF-2 in this medium was quantitated using an FGF-2 detection ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fibroblasts remaining were washed with DMEM, lysed with triple-detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mg/ml sodium deoxycholate) in the presence of 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF, and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4) (all from Sigma). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was used to quantitate FGF-2 in the same ELISA as described above. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—To determine fibroblast DNA synthesis, [3H]thymidine incorporation was used. 6 weeks after culture, the fibroblasts were cultured in serum-free DMEM cell concentration of 2 × 104/ml for 24 h. [3H]Thymidine was added to the cell cultures at 0.5 μCi/ml for 24 h, and the fibroblasts were harvested. The degradations/min were measured and used as an index of DNA synthesis and fibroblast proliferation. Expression of c-Myc, p15INK46, p21CIP1, or p27KIP by Fibroblast Cell Lines and L2 Cells—To determine whether fibroblasts other than primary interstitial fibroblasts respond to TGF-β1 by regulation of c-Myc, p15INK46, p21CIP1, or p27KIP, C3H/10T1/2 and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts were cultured with TGF-β1 in the absence or presence of neutralizing anti-FGF-2 antibody. Because the regulation of c-Myc, p15INK46, p21CIP1, or p27KIP has classically been described for epithelial cells, L2 cells, an AEC line (18Hoffmann G. Grote J. Friedrich F. Mutz N. Schobersberger W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), were cultured with TGF-β1 in the absence or presence of neutralizing anti-FGF-2 antibody in the same manner and used to determine the expression of c-Myc, p15INK46, p21CIP1,orp27KIP, and the results were compared with those obtained with the fibroblast cell lines. Western Analysis to Detect and Quantitate Total and Phosphorylated p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK and c-Myc, p15INK46, p21CIP1, and p27KIP — The fibroblasts remaining after collection of the conditioned medium were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and detached by trypsinization (10Xu Y.D. Hua J. Mui A. O'Connor R. Grotendorst G. Khalil N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L527-L539Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Whole cell protein was extracted with triple-detergent lysis buffer. The protein levels of each sample were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Samples of protein (25 μg) were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in a Mini-Protean II electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). Protein molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences) were run parallel to each blot as an indicator of the molecular weight. Equality of protein loading was evaluated as described (10Xu Y.D.

One of the export apparatus proteins, FlhB, regulates the substrate specificity of the entire apparatus; i.e. it has a role in the ordered export of the two main groups of flagellar structural proteins such that the cell-proximal components (rod-/hook-type proteins) are exported before the cell-distal components (filament-type proteins). The controlled switch between these two export states is believed to be mediated by conformational changes in the structure of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of FlhB (FlhBC), which is consistently and specifically cleaved into two subdomains (FlhBCN and FlhBCC) that remain tightly associated with each other. The cleavage event has been shown to be physiologically significant for the switch. In this study, the mechanism of FlhB cleavage has been more directly analyzed. We demonstrate that cleavage occurs in a heterologous host, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deficient in vacuolar proteinases A and B. In addition, we find that cleavage of a slow-cleaving variant, FlhBC(P270A), is stimulated in vitro at alkaline pH. We also show by analytical gel-filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments that both FlhBC and FlhBC(P270A) are monomeric in solution, and therefore self-proteolysis is unlikely. Finally, we provide evidence via peptide analysis and FlhB cleavage variants that the tertiary structure of FlhB plays a significant role in cleavage. Based on these results, we propose that FlhB cleavage is an autocatalytic process.

Based on these results, we propose that FlhB cleavage is an autocatalytic process. A large percentage of the bacterial flagellar structure lies outside of the cell envelope, thus requiring that the vast majority of the subunits that compose the flagellum be exported from the cytosol across both the inner and outer membranes. Salmonella employs a type III export pathway to accomplish this (1Macnab R.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 2Macnab R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It is a Sec-independent pathway that utilizes a flagellum-specific export apparatus to transport flagellar components across the inner membrane. These exported proteins then travel the length of the developing flagellum within an interior channel prior to their incorporation at the structure's cell-distal end (3Emerson S.U. Tokuyasu K. Simon M.I. Science. 1970; 169: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Iino T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1969; 56: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Morgan D.G. Owen C.

At least nine flagellar proteins are involved in the flagellum-specific export apparatus (7Minamino T. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six are integral membrane components (FlhA, FlhB, FliO, FliP, FliQ, and FliR) postulated to be located within the basal body MS ring (8Macnab R.M. J.

One of the integral membrane proteins, FlhB, has been found to play a central role in export substrate-specificity switching; i.e. regulation of the order in which flagellar subunits are exported, such that proteins incorporated into the cell-proximal rod and hook structures (early export) are exported before proteins that polymerize to form the distal hook-filament junction and flagellar filament structures (late export) (16Fraser G.M. Hirano T. Ferris H.U. Devgan L.L. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Minamino T. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). FlhB is a 42-kDa, 383-amino acid protein that has four putative transmembrane helices in its N-terminal domain (FlhBTM) and a sizable hydrophilic C-terminal domain (FlhBC) 2The abbreviations used are: FlhBCcytoplasmic domain of FlhBFlhBC(P270A)slow-cleaving variant of FlhBCFlhBC(N269A)non-cleaving variant of FlhBCFlhBCNN-terminal subdomain of FlhBCFlhBCCC-terminal subdomain of FlhBCMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight. that is predicted to lie in the cytosol (17Minamino T. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The FlhBC domain itself is also divided into two subdomains: FlhBCN (amino acids 211–269) and FlhBCC (amino acids 270–383) connected via a proposed flexible hinge, based initially on the observation that overproduced soluble FlhBC is consistently and specifically cleaved within the hinge (N269 ↓ P270) with a half-life of ∼5 min, and the resulting subdomains remain tightly associated with each other so that they may be copurified (17Minamino T. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis of the highly conserved cleavage site sequence TN ↓ PTH produced two variants, flhB(N269A) and flhB(P270A), each having a significant effect on FlhB function (16Fraser G.M. Hirano T. Ferris H.U. Devgan L.L. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The flhB(N269A) mutation completely inhibits cleavage, and the flhB(P270A) mutation slows it down significantly. Both mutant proteins are severely defective in their ability to mediate export of the “late” flagellar protein, FliC, whereas early flagellar protein export is unchanged. Cleavage of FlhBC is thus necessary for proper FlhB function. Previous studies also indicate that the cleaved state of FlhBC, rather than the cleavage event in itself, is necessary for substrate-specificity switching (16Fraser G.M. Hirano T. Ferris H.U. Devgan L.L. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). When FlhBTM+CN and FlhBCC are expressed from two different plasmids (resulting in an “already cleaved” FlhB) they are able to successfully complete both rod/hook and filament formation, although not to wild-type levels (17Minamino T. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All these observations led to a proposal that the C-terminal domain of FlhB has two substrate-specificity states and that a conformational change, mediated by cleavage and the interaction between FlhBCN and FlhBCC, regulates the specificity-switching process. cytoplasmic domain of FlhB slow-cleaving variant of FlhBC non-cleaving variant of FlhBC N-terminal subdomain of FlhBC C-terminal subdomain of FlhBC matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight. In an attempt to better understand the role of FlhB cleavage in substrate-specificity switching, we addressed the fundamental question: how does FlhB cleavage occur? We proposed and tested three possible causes of cleavage: 1) protease; 2) self-proteolysis; and 3) autocleavage. To do this, we assayed for FlhBC cleavage in a heterologous host, characterized cleavage in vitro, assayed for FlhBC domain interactions, tested an autocleavage mechanism, and further analyzed the cleavage site. The results support autocleavage via a succinimide pathway in which the cleavage site itself is the catalytic domain, although active only when FlhB is in the appropriate conformation. The implications of this on current models of export substrate-specificity switching are discussed. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Media—Strains and plasmids used are listed in TABLE ONE.

Cell lysates were treated with the protease inhibitor mixture, Complete, Mini-EDTA free (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), prior to column purification. Eluates were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were either detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting with anti-FlhBC (a gift from K. Kutsukake (19Minamino T. Iino T. Kutsukake K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7630-7637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) was performed as described previously (7Minamino T. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detection was carried out using an ECL Plus immunoblotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of Exported Proteins in Culture Supernatants—Isolated second site flhB* suppressor strain cell cultures were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.6–0.8) and then harvested by low speed centrifugation. Proteins in the culture supernatants were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid, incubated at 4 °C overnight and centrifuged at 27,720 × g, 4 °C, for 30 min. The pellets were washed with 1 ml of acetone, centrifuged as before, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and boiled for 10 min before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with polyclonal antibody against either FlgD or FliC. Yeast Methods—The yeast-bacterial shuttle vector, pCu415CUP1 (20Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar), with a Cu2+-inducible promoter as well as a selectable Leu marker, was used for cloning and expression of His-FLAG-FlhBC, His-FLAG-FlhBC(N269A), and His-FLAG-FlhBC(P270A). This shuttle vector replicates well in Escherichia coli and yeast and expresses well in yeast. Rich (YPD) and minimal (SD) media were prepared as described (21Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. 1986; Google Scholar). Wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MHY500) (22Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and protease-deficient (MHY1060) (23Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) yeast were transformed with plasmids encoding the wild-type or variant flhBC gene or the empty vector. Total cell extracts were prepared from logarithmically growing yeast cultures (2.5 A600). The cells were subsequently lysed in a protocol similar to the 20% trichloroacetic acid method of Foiani et al. (24Foiani M. Marini F. Gamba D. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with 20% trichloroacetic acid and then were resuspended in 400 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were disrupted by vortexing for 5 min in the presence of glass beads. The lysates were drained from the beads and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g in a tabletop microcentrifuge. The pellets were washed once with 2% trichloroacetic acid and then resuspended in 200 μlof1× Laemmli buffer, neutralized by adding 30 μlof1 m Tris base, boiled for 5 min, and clarified by centrifugation. Cell lysates were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by Western blotting. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was performed using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge with an An60Ti rotor (Beckman). Prior to ultracentrifugation the protein samples were extensively dialyzed against TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl, and1mm EDTA), which was also used as the blank. Measurements were made at 20 °C at speeds of 26,000, 29,000, and 32,000 rpm on wild-type FlhBC (A280 of 0.36) and FlhBC(P270A) (A280 of 0.46) using a charcoal-filled Epon and quartz windows. Concentration profiles of the samples were monitored by absorbance at a wavelength of 280 nm and recorded at a spacing of 0.001 cm in the step mode, with 20 averages per step, for 10, 16, and 22 h after each rotor speed was reached. Equilibrium data were analyzed using Beckman Optima™ XL-A/XL-I data analysis software, version 4.0, provided as an add-on to Origin Version 4.1 (MicroCal Inc.). The partial specific volume, 0.729 ml/g, for wild-type FlhBC and for FlhBC(P270A), was based on the amino acid composition of each protein. Analytical Gel-filtration Chromatography—Analytical gel-filtration chromatography of wild-type FlhBC and FlhBC(P270A) was performed with a Superdex™ 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) were used as size markers. All fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. Peptide Synthesis—Small scale, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) peptide synthesis was carried out on a Rainin Symphony instrument (Rainin Instrument, Woburn, MA) that provides on-instrument cleavage of the peptide from the resin, by the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. The peptide synthesis service included an analytical reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography profile and a MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of each peptide synthesized. Analysis of FlhBC Cleavage in a Heterologous Host—As reported previously, cleavage of overexpressed FlhBC occurs in mutants defective in the flhDC master operon (16Fraser G.M. Hirano T. Ferris H.U. Devgan L.L. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that should a protease be involved, it is highly unlikely to be a flagellar-specific protein. Attempts to identify a candidate protease in E. coli and Salmonella genome databases were unsuccessful. Also, querying a peptidase database against the full consensus TNPTH and the limited consensus NP of the FlhB cleavage site failed to identify any candidates (16Fraser G.M. Hirano T. Ferris H.U. Devgan L.L. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We thus decided to assay for cleavage when FlhBC is overexpressed in S. cerevisiae, based on the assumption that it is highly unlikely that this heterologous host would have a protease that would consistently and specifically cleave a bacterial type III flagellar export component. For convenience the assays were conducted with the soluble domain of FlhB (FlhBC), because both overexpressed full-length FlhB and FlhBC are cleaved. His-FLAG-FlhBC, His-FLAG-FlhBC(N269A), and His-FLAG-FlhBC(P270A) were expressed in two different yeast strains: MHY500 (wild-type) and MHY1060 (deficient in the vacuolar proteinases A and B, which affect nonspecific proteolysis of proteins produced in the cell). Whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining or immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Fig. 2A) and polyclonal anti-FlhBC antibody (Fig. 2B). Cleavage behavior identical to that which has been observed in Salmonella and E. coli is observed in both yeast strains. His-FLAG-FlhBC is detected in a completely cleaved state, His-FLAG-FlhBC(N269A) in a non-cleaved state, and His-FLAG-FlhBC(P270A) also in a non-cleaved state. Similarly, the blot probed with anti-FlhBC shows the secondary cleavage site products observed previously (16Fraser G.M. Hirano T. Ferris H.U. Devgan L.L. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A second set of aliquots from the same cultures used for these analyses was prepared in parallel but using a different lysis method (NaOH/SDS). Interestingly, the cleavage states of His-FLAG-FlhBC and His-FLAG-FlhBC(N269A) were identical to that shown in Fig. 2, but His-FLAG-FlhBC(P270A) was detected in a completely cleaved state (data not shown). In Vitro Cleavage Assays of the Slow-cleaving Variant of FlhBC, FlhBC(P270A)—A straightforward experiment addressing the possibility that FlhBC may be capable of self-cleaving, either via a proteolytic domain or an autocleavage mechanism, was to test if, and under what experimental conditions, purified FlhBC cleavage occurs in vitro. Due to the fact that wild-type FlhBC is cleaved very rapidly, the slow-cleaving variant, FlhBC(P270A), was used to follow cleavage under different conditions. His-FLAG-FlhBC(P270A), was overexpressed in E. coli cells and purified under native conditions via a cobalt-affinity column in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture. Those elution fractions containing the highest concentrations of uncleaved FlhBC(P270A) were used for subsequent in vitro cleavage assays. The cleavage of FlhBC(P270A) was not significantly influenced by concentration of FlhBC(P270A) alone, or by incubation of FlhBC(P270A) with FlhBC or FlhBC(N269A), and did not vary significantly between incubations at temperatures ranging from 30° to 50 °C (cleavage was still observed after incubation at 4 °C), as assayed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining or immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-FlhBC (data not shown). However, a dramatic effect on cleavage was observed under different pH conditions (Fig. 3A). Acidic conditions slowed cleavage (lane 1), whereas basic conditions promoted cleavage (lane 3). The higher the pH is, the more efficient the cleavage event (Fig. 3B). An attempt to analyze the conformational change of FlhBC(P270A) over a basic pH range (from 7 to 10) using circular dichroic spectroscopy provided inconclusive results; however, it did confirm the α-helical secondary structure predicted with PRO-DOM release 2002.1 (25Corpet F. Servant F. Gouzy J. Kahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Hydrodynamic Properties of Wild-type and Slow-cleaving Variants of FlhBC—Oligomerization analysis was performed to assess whether FlhBC might be able to act as a protease on another FlhBC. To accomplish this, we first carried out analytical gel-filtration chromatography of His-FLAG-FlhBC and His-FLAG-FlhBC(P270A) with a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Fig. 4). Wild-type FlhBC and FlhBC(P270A) were found to elute at volumes of 12.5 and 12.3 ml, respectively, yielding apparent molecular masses of ∼26 kDa and 27 kDa, respectively, indicating that they are monomeric in solution. To further test the oligomeric states of His-FLAG-FlhBC and His-FLAG-FlhBC(P270A), we performed sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, a technique used to determine the molecular mass of particles independent of their shape (Fig. 5). The data were collected and analyzed using the manufacturer's software. A single species model produced the best fit for both samples in terms of low residuals and calculated molecular masses of 19.5 kDa for His-FLAG-FlhBC and 21.1 kDa for His-FLAG-FlhBC(P270A), which agree well with each of their deduced molecular masses. Therefore, according to both techniques, FlhBc and FlhBC(P270A) are monomeric in solution, suggesting that cleavage is internal and not due to persistent dimerization interactions. Cleavage as a result of transient interactions seems unlikely as there was no observed change in FlhBC(P270A) cleavage when incubated with other FlhBC variants. Further emphasizing the role of internal conformation, although previous studies showed that a construct expressing FlhBTM+CN and FlhBCC separately was able to complement an flhB null partially (17Minamino T. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), expressing full-length FlhB(N269A) and an additional wild-type FlhBCC together did not complement the flhB null (data not shown).FIGURE 5Sedimentation equilibrium of wild-type FlhBC and FlhBC(P270A). The bottom graph shows the fitted curves of the experimental data collected for wild-type FlhBC (circles) and FlhBC(P270A) (triangles) at 29,000 rpm. On the two upper graphs the residuals of the fit are plotted. For each sample, absorbance data at three speeds were obtained and fitted with a single-species model, in which the molecular mass of the monomer was fixed at 22,642 for wild-type FlhBC and 22,608 for FlhBC(P270A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mass Spectrometric Analysis of FlhBC—The transmembrane domain of FlhB (FlhBTM) and the majority of the FlhBCN subdomain had previously been shown to be unnecessary for cleavage to occur (16Fraser G.M. Hirano T. Ferris H.U. Devgan L.L. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Minamino T. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility that the cleavage site itself might constitute the “catalytic domain” was considered. Precedent for such a non-enzymatic autocleavage mechanism is found in the intein excision pathway (26Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), as well as in the aging process of the optical lens protein, α-crystallin (27Voorter C.E.M. de-Haard-Hoekman W.A. van den Oetelaar P.J.M. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19020-19023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both events involve asparagine cyclization to a succinimide intermediate resulting in deamidation or peptide bond cleavage. Deamidation is impossible with wild-type FlhBC because of the presence of a proline residue downstream of the cleavage site, and thus we tested for the presence of the succinimide ring at the C terminus of the FlhBCN cleavage product. In-gel cyanogen bromide digest of purified FlhBCN followed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry failed to detect the succinimide ring, but confirmed that the C-terminal residue of FlhBCN is asparagine. This result, combined with the N-terminal amino acid sequencing data of FlhBCC (17Minamino T. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4906-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), indicates that the cleavage site is clean; there is apparently no degradation. Peptide Analysis of the Cleavage Site—FlhB homologues in several different bacterial species share the highly conserved amino acid sequence motif TNPTH at the cleavage site and undergo cleavage. We examined three synthetic peptides composed of seven amino acid residues: IVTNPTH (wild-type), IVTAPTH (N269A variation), and IVT-NATH (P270A variation). The peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the amino acid compositions were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. These procedures showed that each of the three peptides eluted as a single peak in high-performance liquid chromatography and was of the expected amino acid sequence; i.e. no deviation that might be attributed to the presence of a succinimide ring was detected, suggesting that a local conformation that is present in FlhB is necessary for cleavage to occur. In parallel, three 33-residue oligopeptides composed of the cleavage region (and its two variants) and an 82-residue oligopeptid"

While expression of cyclin D1 correlates with MCL development, expression of wild-type (WT) cyclin D1 transgene in murine lymphocytes is unable to drive B-cell lymphoma. As cyclin D1 mutants that are refractory to nuclear export display heighten oncogenicity in vitro compared with WT D1, we generated mice expressing FLAG-D1/T286A, a constitutively nuclear mutant, under the control of the immunoglobulin enhancer, Emu. D1/T286A transgenic mice universally develop a mature B-cell lymphoma. Expression of D1/T286A in B lymphocytes results in S phase entry in resting lymphocytes and increased apoptosis in spleens of young premalignant mice. Lymphoma onset correlates with perturbations in p53/MDM2/p19Arf expression and with BcL-2 overexpression suggesting that alterations in one or both of these pathways may contribute to lymphoma development. Our results describe a cyclin D1-driven model of B-cell lymphomagenesis and provide evidence that nuclear-retention of cyclin D1 is oncogenic in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2019693522,"The induction of the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 (Sdc1) in stromal fibroblasts is observed in more than 70% of human breast carcinomas. Using a coculture model, we have recently shown that stromal cell-derived Sdc1 stimulates carcinoma cell proliferation in vitro, and that this activity requires Sdc1 glycanation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of stromal cell Sdc1 on breast carcinoma growth in vivo. MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells were inoculated into the flanks of athymic nude mice either alone, or as mixed suspensions with Sdc1-transfected or mock-transfected 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. The mixed tumors showed an intimate association between carcinoma cells and stromal fibroblasts and histologically closely resembled poorly differentiated human breast carcinomas. The presence of fibroblasts led to significantly accelerated tumor growth, which was further augmented (88% increase) by forced expression of stromal Sdc1. The hyperemic macroscopic appearance of tumors containing Sdc1-positive stromal cells contrasted with pale tumors developing in the presence of mock-transfected fibroblasts, which prompted us to examine tumor microvessels. Stromal Sdc1 expression was associated with a significantly elevated microvessel density (36% increase) and a larger vessel area (153% increase). To evaluate the relevance of this finding in human breast cancer, the relationship between stromal Sdc1 and tumor vascularity was also examined in a tissue array containing 207 human breast carcinoma samples. Similar to the xenografts, stromal Sdc1 expression correlated with both vessel density (P=0.013) and total vessel area (P=0.0026). In conclusion, stromal fibroblast-derived Sdc1 stimulates breast carcinoma growth and angiogenesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2036916757,"Tracking stem cell localization, survival, differentiation, and proliferation after transplantation in living subjects is essential for understanding stem cell biology and physiology. In this study, we investigated the long-term stability of reporter gene expression in an embryonic rat cardiomyoblast cell line and the role of epigenetic modulation on reversing reporter gene silencing. Cells were stably transfected with plasmids carrying cytomegalovirus promoter driving firefly luciferase reporter gene (CMV-Fluc) and passaged repeatedly for 3-8 months. Within the highest expressor clone, the firefly luciferase activity decreased progressively from passage 1 (843+/-28) to passage 20 (250+/-10) to passage 40 (44+/-3) to passage 60 (3+/-1 RLU/microg; P<0.05 vs. passage 1). Firefly luciferase activity was maximally rescued by treatment with 5-azacytidine (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) compared with trichostatin A (histone deacetylase inhibitor) and retinoic acid (transcriptional activator; P<0.05). Increasing dosages of 5-azacytidine treatment led to higher levels of firefly luciferase mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein (Western blots) and inversely lower levels of methylation in the CMV promoter (DNA nucleotide sequence). These in vitro results were extended to in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of cell transplant in living animals. Cells treated with 5-azacytidine were monitored for 2 wk compared with 1 wk for untreated cells (P<0.05). These findings should have important implications for reporter gene-based imaging of stem cell transplantation."

AML1 is one of the most frequently mutated genes associated with human acute leukemia, suggesting that genetic alterations of the gene contribute to leukemogenesis. Here, we report the analysis of mice carrying conditional AML1 knockout alleles that were inactivated using the Cre/loxP system. AML1 was deleted in adult mice by inducing Cre activity to replicate AML1 deletions found in human MDS, familial platelet disorder and rare de novo human AML. At a latency of 2 months after induction, the thymus was reduced in size and frequently populated by immature double negative thymocytes, indicating defective T-lymphocyte maturation, resulting in lymphatic diseases with 50% penetrance, including atypical hyperplasia and thymic lymphoma. Metastatic lymphomas to the liver and the meninges were observed. Mice also developed splenomegaly with an expansion of the myeloid compartment. Increased Howell-Jolly body counts indicated splenic hypofunction. Thrombocytopenia occurred due to immaturity of mini-megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Together with mild lymphocytopenia in the peripheral blood and increased fractions of immature cells in the bone marrow, AML1 deficient mice display features of a myelodysplastic syndrome, suggesting a preleukemic state."
https://openalex.org/W2078515067,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded X antigen (HBxAg) contributes to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A frequent characteristic of HCC is reduced or absent expression of the cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin, although it is not known whether HBxAg plays a role. To address this, the levels of E-cadherin were determined in HBxAg-positive and -negative HepG2 cells in culture, and in tumor and surrounding nontumor liver from a panel of HBV carriers. The results showed an inverse relationship between HBxAg and E-cadherin expression both in tissue culture and in vivo. In HBxAg-positive cells, E-cadherin was suppressed at both the mRNA and protein levels. This was associated with hypermethylation of the E-cadherin promoter. Depressed E-cadherin correlated with HBxAg trans-activation function, as did the migration of HepG2 cells in vitro. Decreased expression of E-cadherin was also associated with the accumulation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm and/or nuclei in tissues and cell lines, which is characteristic of activated beta-catenin. Additional work showed that HBxAg-activated beta-catenin. Together, these results suggest that the HBxAg is associated with decreased expression of E-cadherin, accumulation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and increased cell migration, which may contribute importantly to hepatocarcinogenesis."

Here, we show that Shigella Spa33 is an essential component of the C-ring compartment involved in mediating the transit of various TTSM-associated translocated proteins. Electron microscopic analysis and pull-down assay revealed Spa33 to be localized beneath the TTSM via interaction with MxiG and MxiJ (basal body components). Spa33 is also capable of interacting with Spa47 (TTSM ATPase), MxiK, MxiN (required for the transit of MxiH, the needle component), Spa32 (required for determining needle length), and several effectors. Genetic and functional analyses of the Spa33 C-terminal region, which is highly conserved in the SpaO-YscQ-HrcQB-FliN family, indicate that some of the conserved residues are crucial for needle formation via interactions with MxiN.

The needle portion of the Shigella TTSM is composed of MxiH and MxiI, and the basal body is composed of MxiD, MxiG, and MxiJ (8Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A.

Genetic and functional analyses indicate that some of the TTSM-associated proteins such as MxiK, MxiN, Spa32, and Spa47 are involved in forming the functional needle, where MxiN is thought to be required for translocation of MxiH, the major needle component, through the basal body (14Jouihri N.

The C-ring compartment of TTSM is assumed to be involved in recognition of the secreted signals carried by effectors and to be responsible for the promiscuous character of the TTSM in regards to heterologous secreted proteins.

Previous studies have indicated that Pseudomonas syringae HrcQB is located on the cytoplasmic side of the TTSM. HrcQB shares partial amino acid sequence similarity with FliN (a flagella C-ring component), Shigella Spa33, Salmonella SpaO, and Yersinia YscQ (12Tampakaki A.P. Fadouloglou V.E. Gazi A.D.

Our results provide the first direct evidence that, in the TTSM of animal pathogens, Spa33 is an essential C-ring component required for TTSM needle formation. The bacterial strains and plasmids used are listed in supplemental Table S1. The various spa33 gene fragments amplified by PCR were digested with BamHI and SalI and then ligated into the corresponding sites of pTB-Myc or pGST. The point mutants on pMW-spa33 and pGST-spa33 were created with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All S. flexneri-derived strains were grown routinely in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Difco, Detroit, MI) or L-broth. Strains harboring pMW119-Tp, pTB101-Tp, or pCACTUS-Tp-based plasmids were grown in Mueller-Hinton broth (Difco) supplemented with 5 μg/ml trimethoprim. For construction of a nonpolar spa33 mutant, the aphA-3 (kanamycin resistance gene) cassette specifically designed for the construction of a nonpolar mutant was used (22Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). For GST-fused proteins, Escherichia coli BL21 harboring pGEX-4T-1derivatives were cultivated in L-broth supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml)for 3 h at 37°C. Expression was induced by the addition of 1 or 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubation for 3 h at 37°C. Bacteria were disrupted by sonication. Purification of the GST-fused proteins with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Anti-IpaB, -IpaC, and -IpaD antibodies used for immnoblotting were described previously (23Watarai M. Tobe T. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Anti-MxiD, -MxiG, -MxiJ, and -Spa32 antibodies used for immnoblotting were also described previously (8Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Tamano K. Katayama E. Toyotome T. Sasakawa C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1244-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-Spa33 and -Spa47 antibodies were raised against recombinant Spa33 and Spa47 proteins. The GST proteins were cleaved with thrombin according to the manufacturer's protocol. Anti-MxiK and -MxiN antibodies were prepared as follows. The synthetic peptides of MxiK-(CNEGMQYAKRHFTGIQTSCL) and MxiN-(CRQIAEDLLKENPVND) were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) and injected into rabbits. Anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were obtained commercially. A small aliquot of an overnight culture of S. flexneri grown at 30 °C in L-broth was inoculated into 20 ml of BHI broth, and the bacteria were grown at 37 °C for 2.5 h to an optical density of 1.3 at 600 nm. Proteins secreted by S. flexneri were analyzed as described previously (8Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Tamano K. Aizawa S. Sasakawa C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 358: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A 10-ml aliquot from an overnight culture grown at 30 °C in L-broth was inoculated into 1 liter of L-broth, and the bacteria were grown until the late log phase (1 × 109 cells/ml) at 37 °C. The type III needle complexes of S. flexneri were purified as described previously (8Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Tamano K. Aizawa S. Sasakawa C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 358: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Bacteria were collected after centrifugation of 5 ml of bacterial culture in L-broth grown to the early log phase with shaking at 37 °C. Osmotically shocked cells were prepared as described previously (24Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Yamaguchi S. Namba K. Aizawa S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) with several modifications. S. flexneri-derived strains were cultured in 100 ml of L-broth until the late log phase at 37 °C. The bacteria collected by centrifugation were suspended in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. 5 mg of Dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) were dissolved into 0.5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the suspension. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to a 100 mm final concentration to quench any unreacted cross-linkers. (i)Observation of Purified Type III Needle Complexes and Osmotically Shocked Cells of S. flexneri—Samples were placed onto carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0. Samples were observed and pictures were taken with a JEM-2000ES or JEM-1200EX transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).(ii)Immunoelectron Microscopy—The post-embedding immunogold method was employed S. flexneri, cultured at 37 °C to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm, was harvested. The bacteria were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer, dehydrated with a graded ethanol series, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultra-thin sections were placed onto nickel-coated copper grids and stained with rabbit anti-Myc antibody and Protein A conjugated with gold colloidal particles (5 and 10 nm diameter; EY Laboratory). Samples were stained with uranyl acetate and observed, then images were obtained with a JEM-1200EX TEM (JEOL). For GST pull down assay, E. coli MC1061, harboring the pTB101-Tp or pTB-Myc derivative, were cultured in L-broth with 50 μg/ml of ampicillin for 2 h at 37 °C. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, bacteria were harvested. The bacterial culture was collected and lysed by sonication in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm AEBSF, pH 7.5). The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants (lysates) were used for pull-down assay. The GST-fused protein derivatives bound to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were mixed with a cleared extract of MC1061 harboring pTB101-Tp or pTB-Myc and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed by centrifugation, and beads were washed four times with ice-cold RIPA buffer. After the final wash, supernatants were removed, and 25 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer were added to each sample. S. flexneri-derived strains were cultured in BHI-broth for 1.5 h at 37 °C. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After incubation for 1.5 h at 37 °C, the bacteria were harvested. The bacterial culture was collected and lysed by sonication in 1 ml of RIPA buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants (lysates) were incubated with the appropriate anti-FLAG antibody overnight at 4 °C. Then, 25 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were mixed with the immune complexes and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer. Spa33 Is Essential for TTSM Needle Formation—To characterize the role of Spa33 in TTSM function, a non-polar spa33 deletion mutant (Δspa33) (Fig. 1A) in YSH6000 (wild-type S. flexneri) was investigated for its capacity to secrete IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD. In agreement with a previous a study (25Schuch R. Maurelli A.T. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2180-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we confirmed that the Ipa proteins were secreted into phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.003% Congo red (CR supernatant), a conditional medium that stimulates TTSM activity, by WT and Δspa33/pMW-spa33 but not by Δspa33 or del-17 (a TTSM-defective mutant) (Fig. 1B, top). Although Spa33 was present in whole cell lysates prepared from WT or Δspa33/pMW-spa33, none was detected in the CR supernatant (Fig. 1B, bottom). TEM analysis of the TTSM extensively purified from Δspa33 revealed that Δspa33 produces a defective TTSM without the needle portion (Fig. 1C, panel b), a defect similar to that of the mixH mutant (defective in production of the TTSM needle component) or the spa47 mutant (ATPase defect) (8Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When pMW-spa33 was introduced into Δspa33 (Δspa33/pMW-spa33), the capacity to produce intact TTSM was restored (Fig. 1C, panel c) to the WT level (Fig. 1C, panel a). In addition, TEM analysis of the osmotically shocked cells ensured TTSM with needles within the envelopes of WT and Δspa33/pMW-spa33 but not in the Δspa33 envelope (Fig. 1C, bottom), suggesting that spa33 is essential for the formation of TTSM needles. Spa33 Is Located beneath the TTSM in the Cytoplasm—To determine the localization of Spa33, we investigated whether Spa33 was present in the purified TTSM from WT by immunoblottings with anti-Spa33, -MxiD, -MxiG, or -MxiJ antibody. Spa33 was detected with MxiD, MxiG, and MxiJ in the purified TTSM but not in the corresponding sample from del-17 (Fig. 2A). To pursue this, we analyzed the location of Spa33 in Δspa33/pMW-Myc-spa33 by immuno-gold EM with anti-Myc antibody, and the results showed that the gold particles were mostly localized within the cytoplasm in the vicinity of the bacterial membrane (Fig. 2B). Since the MxiG and MxiJ of Shigella are the major inner membrane positional TTSM components (4Blocker A. Jouihri N. Larquet E. Gounon P. Ebel F. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Spa33 was associated with MxiG or MxiJ and tested the idea by creating GST-MxiG and -MxiJ and performing pull-down assays with lysates prepared from E. coli expressing Spa33. Spa33 was pulled down by GST-MxiG, and although the amount was less than that pulled down by GST-MxiG, Spa33 was also pulled down by GST-MxiJ (Fig. 2C). We then created various truncated versions of Spa33 to analyze the domain of Spa33 involved in binding with MxiG and MxiJ. We found Spa331-216, Spa3381-293, and Spa3381-216, but not Spa331-80 or Spa33217-293, to be pulled down by GST-MxiG and GST-MxiJ, suggesting that MxiG and MxiJ associate with the middle portion of Spa33 (Fig. 2D). To directly demonstrate the location of Spa33 in TTSM using EM, we treated Δspa33/pMW-Myc-spa33 with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), a cross-linking reagent, and purified TTSM from the bacteria. The TEM analysis indicated a macromolecular structure to be associated with the lower portion of the TTSM basal body structure (Fig. 2E, arrows). Indeed, immuno-gold EM revealed that gold particles were detectable beneath the basal body of the TTSM (Fig. 2E). Based on the results of this series of experiments, we concluded that Spa33 is a cytoplasmic TTSM component associated with the major inner membrane positional TTSM components MxiG and MxiJ. Spa33 Interacts with TTSM-associated Proteins—Our and other previous studies (4Blocker A. Jouihri N. Larquet E. Gounon P. Ebel F. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 14Jouihri N. Sory M.P. Page A.L. Gounon P. Parsot C. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have shown the mxiH, mxiI, mxiK, mixN, spa32, or spa47 mutants to be deficient in forming the needle structure, as was the case in this study of the spa33 mutant (this study). These earlier results prompted us to hypothesize that the defective Δspa33 phenotype is attributable to the interaction between Spa33 and some of the proteins involved in needle formation. To test this hypothesis, we initially attempted to investigate the capacity of Spa33 to interact with the TTSS-associated proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. However, screening with the bait Spa33 yielded no positive clones, suggesting the bait to not be functional in the yeast two-hybrid system. Indeed, the same problem was also reported previously by other investigators (14Jouihri N. Sory M.P. Page A.L. Gounon P. Parsot C. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, we created GST-MxiH, -MxiI, -MxiK, -MxiN, -Spa32, and -Spa47 and performed GST pull-down assays using bacterial lysates prepared from E. coli expressing Spa33. The proteins that bound with each of the GST-fused proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Spa33 antibody. Spa33 was pulled down by GST-MxiK, -MxiN, -Spa32, and -Spa47 but not by GST-MxiH or -MxiI (Fig. 3A). To confirm the ability of Spa33 to interact with these proteins in Shigella, we created Δspa33/ pFlag-spa33 and Δspa33/pTB-spa33 and performed immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. The bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MixK, -MxiN, -Spa32, and -Spa47 antibodies. MxiN, Spa32, and Spa47 were precipitated in Δspa33/pFlag-spa33 but not in Δspa33/pTB-spa33 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Spa33 is capable of interacting with multiple proteins involved in needle formation (8Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 14Jouihri N. Sory M.P. Page A.L. Gounon P. Parsot C. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Magdalena J. Hachani A. Chamekh M. Jouihri N. Gounon P. Blocker A. Allaoui A. J.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1244-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MxiK was barely detectable under these conditions (data not shown), since MxiK was nearly undetectable in both of the bacterial lyastes upon immunoblotting with anti-MxiK antibody. To identify the Spa33 domain(s) involved in interacting with MxiN, Spa32, or Spa47, we created a series of GST-Spa33 versions (Fig. 3C, lower part) and subjected the resulting GST-Spa331-80, -Spa3381-216, -Spa33217-293, -Spa331-216, and -Spa3381-293 to GST pull-down assays using bacterial lysates prepared from E. coli expressing MxiN, Spa32, or Spa47. MxiN and Spa32 interacted with the C-terminal portion of Spa33 encompassing residues 217-293, while Spa47 interacted with the N-terminal 80-amino acid portion (Fig. 3C, top). To test the possibility that Spa33 interacts with other translocating effectors, we used GST pull-down assays to investigate the capacity of Spa33 to interact with effectors, such as VirA, IcsB, IpaC, and IpgB1. Each of the GST-fused proteins created were mixed with bacterial lysates prepared from E. coli expressing Spa33, and the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Spa33 antibody. Although the extent varied among proteins, Spa33 was associated with all of the effectors examined, but not with GST alone (Fig. 3D), indicating that Spa33 has affinities for multiple proteins. Functional Analysis of Spa33 C-terminal Portion—The C-terminal portion of Spa33 is highly conserved in Spa33 homologues of various TTSMs. Notably, the 9 residues in Spa33, i.e. Leu-242, Asn-266, Gly-267, Leu-269, Gly-273, Val-276, Gly-283, and Ile-286, are strictly conserved among flagella FliN, Salmonella SpaO, and Yersinia YscQ, and 5 of the 9 residues are also conserved in Pseudomonas HrcQB (Fig. 4A). We therefore substituted other residues having opposite chemical characteristics for each of the 9 residues in Spa33. Each of the point mutants created in the spa33 gene cloned into pMW-spa33 were introduced into Δspa33, and the effect of the single amino acid substitution on TTSM needle formation and the ability to secrete Ipa proteins was investigated. The Spa33 variants designated Spa33G273S and Spa33I286Q produced defective TTSM lacking needles, and Spa33L242Q produced heterogeneous TTSM composed of defective and normal structures (Fig. 4A). The remaining six variants, Spa33V226Q, Spa33N266A, Spa33G267S, Spa33L269Q, Spa33V276N, and Spa33G283S, produced normal TTSM structures (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Leu-242, Gly-273, and Ile-286 are critical residues for the functioning of Spa33. To confirm this, the abilities of the single-amino acid-substituted variants to secrete IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD into the CR supernatant were investigated. Like Δspa33, the Spa33G273S, Spa33I286Q, and Spa33L242Q variants were unable to secrete Ipa proteins into the CR supernatant (Fig. 4C). Since Spa32 has been shown to be translocated via the TTSM into the medium to determine needle length (16Magdalena J. Hachani A. Chamekh M. Jouihri N. Gounon P. Blocker A. Allaoui A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3433-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Tamano K. Katayama E. Toyotome T. Sasakawa C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1244-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the effects of the single-amino acid-substituted variants of Spa33 on Spa32 secretion were also investigated. Spa33L242Q, Spa33G273S, and Spa33I286Q, but not the others, failed to secrete Spa32 (Fig. 4C), suggesting Leu-242, Gly-273, and Ile-286 in the C-terminal portion of Spa33 to be the critical residues for needle formation and effector secretion. Since the C-terminal portion of Spa33 interacted with MxiN and Spa32, which are thought to be involved in needle formation (Fig. 3C) and length determination, respectively (14Jouihri N. Sory M.P. Page A.L. Gounon P. Parsot C. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Magdalena J. Hachani A. Chamekh M. Jouihri N. Gounon P. Blocker A. Allaoui A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3433-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Tamano K. Katayama E. Toyotome T. Sasakawa C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1244-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we investigated Spa33L242Q, Spa33G273S, and Spa33I286Q for their capacities to interact with MxiN, Spa32, or Spa47 (as the positive control). GST-Spa33L242Q, -Spa33G273S, -Spa33I286Q, and -Spa33WT were incubated with bacterial lysates prepared from E. coli expressing MxiN, Spa32, or Spa47, and the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. All of the Spa33 mutants were able to associate with Spa32 and Spa47, but Spa33G273S and Spa33I286Q had no ability to bind to MxiN (Fig. 4D). Note that minimal MxiN was pulled down by GST-Spa33L242Q under these conditions, but the amount was much smaller than that pulled down by GST-Spa33WT (Fig. 4D). These results thus suggest that the residues of Spa33 strictly conserved among its homologues play critical roles in interacting with MxiN, which has been indicated to mediate the transit of MxiH, the needle component (8Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Tamano K. Aizawa S. Sasakawa C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 358: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Specificity of Spa33 Function to Shigella—We investigated the capacities of the Spa33 homologues SpaO, YscQ, and HrcQB to interact with MxiN and other Shigella-TTSM-associated proteins, i.e. MxiK, Spa32, Spa47, MxiG, and MxiJ, by GST-pull down assay. SpaO was pulled down by all but GST-MxiG, while YscQ and HrcQB were not pulled down by any of the GST-fused proteins (Fig. 5A). This suggests that the inability of SpaO to interact with MxiG, or of YscQ and HrcQB to interact with TTSM components, may result in an inability to rescue the deficient phenotype of Δspa33. To confirm this, we investigated whether SpaO, YscQ, or HrcQB could rescue Spa33 function by introducing spaO, yscQ, and hrcQB clones, respectively, into Δspa33. We then employed immunoblotting to investigate Δspa33/pMyc-spaO, Δspa33/pMyc-yscQ, or Δspa33/pMyc-hrcQB together with Δspa33/pMyc-spa33 for the ability to rescue secretion of IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD into the CR supernatant. Δspa33/pMyc-spa33 rescued defective Δspa33 function, but Δspa33/pMyc-spaO, Δspa33/pMyc-yscQ, and Δspa33/pMyc-hrcQB did not (Fig. 5B). Thus, although SpaO shares significant amino acid homology with Spa33 (supplemental Fig. S1) and has the capacity to interact with Shigella TTSM-associated proteins except MxiG (12Tampakaki A.P.

In the present study, we investigated the role of Spa33 in Shigella TTSM formation and protein translocation and found structural and functional evidence to support the concept that Spa33 is an essential component of the C-ring structure involved in TTSM-associated protein translocation. Although it has been proposed that Spa33 (or its homologues) is a component of the TTSM C-ring structure (3Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Thus, to our knowledge, the present study is the first to provide convincing evidence to support this notion. This conclusion is based on the following findings: (i) the spa33 deletion mutant of Shigella produces a needle-less TTSM structure and is unable to secrete any effectors via the TTSM"

Nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in the regulation of apoptosis, but its role in Fas-induced cell death and the underlying mechanism are largely unknown. Here we show that stimulation of the Fas receptor by its ligand (FasL) results in rapid generation of NO and concomitant decrease in cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP) expression without significant effect on Fas and Fas-associated death domain (FADD) adapter protein levels. FLIP down-regulation as well as caspase-8 activation and apoptosis induced by FasL were all inhibited by the NO-liberating agent sodium nitroprusside and dipropylenetriamine NONOate, whereas the NO synthase inhibitor aminoguanidine and NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) had opposite effects, indicating an anti-apoptotic role of NO in the Fas signaling process. FasL-induced down-regulation of FLIP is mediated by a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that is negatively regulated by NO. S-nitrosylation of FLIP is an important mechanism rendering FLIP resistant to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by FasL. Deletion analysis shows that the caspase-like domain of FLIP is a key target for S-nitrosylation by NO, and mutations of its cysteine 254 and cysteine 259 residues completely inhibit S-nitrosylation, leading to increased ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of FLIP. These findings indicate a novel pathway for NO regulation of FLIP that provides a key mechanism for apoptosis regulation and a potential new target for intervention in death receptor-associated diseases.

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that serves to eliminate unwanted cells and is essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. It can be triggered by extracellular signals via death receptors that belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (1Ozoren N. El-Deiry W.S. Semin.

In particular, Fas (CD95/Apo-1) plays a crucial role in maintaining the immune system by inducing apoptosis of immune cells as well as in killing harmful cells such as cancerous cells (3Nagata S.

Although FasL binding to its receptor is required for such activation, Fas surface expression does not necessarily render cells susceptible to FasL-induced cell death, indicating that inhibitors of the apoptosis signaling pathway exist and play a role (3Nagata S.

FLIP inhibits apoptotic signaling by interfering with the binding of caspase-8 to FADD at the death-inducing signaling complex (14Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V.

Endogenously produced nitric oxide (NO) synthesized from l-arginine by NO synthase is a mediator of a variety of physiological and pathological processes (21Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A.

NO has been shown to possess both pro- and anti-apoptotic functions depending on cell type, redox status, and type and dose of NO-modulating agents (23Davis K.L. Martin E. Turko I.V. Murad F. Annu.

On the other hand, endogenous NO production or exposure to appropriate amounts of NO has been reported to inhibit apoptosis in several cell types (26Chung H.T. Pae H.O. Choi B.M. Billiar T.R.

The mechanisms by which NO regulates apoptosis are not well understood, but both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways of apoptosis are known to be involved (30Borutaite V. Brown G.C. Free Radic.

In the present study we attempted to investigate the role of NO in Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis and determine its regulatory mechanisms using pharmacological and genetic manipulation approaches. Our findings demonstrate an important role of NO in FLIP regulation and its anti-apoptotic function in Fas death signaling. The mechanism by which NO regulates FLIP involves S-nitrosylation and its inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, thus revealing the existence of a novel mechanism of cell death regulation that might be exploited in death receptor-induced apoptosis of neoplastic and immune cells. Cells and Reagents—The human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Mannassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C. Recombinant FasL (SuperFasL), monoclonal antibody against FLIP (Dave-2), and the NO donor DPTA NONOate were purchased from Alexis Biochem (San Diego, CA). Antibodies for Fas, FADD, and peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies to IgG and protein A-agarose were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for ubiquitin, S-nitrosocysteine, and β-actin were from Sigma. The NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), NO inhibitors amino-guanidine (AG), 2-(4-carboxy-phenyl)-4,4,5,5 tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxy-3-oxide (PTIO), and caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone were from Sigma. The transfecting agent Lipofectamine Plus was purchased from Invitrogen, and the caspase-8 fluorometric substrate IETD-amino-4-methyl coumarin (AMC) was from Biovision Inc. (Mountain View, CA). Plasmid Construction and Transfection—The pcDNA3-FLIPL plasmid was generously provided by Dr. C. Stehlik (West Virginia University Cancer Center, Morgantown, WV). The open reading frame of FLIPL and ubiquitin were amplified by high fidelity PCR (Stratagene) from the corresponding expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and cloned into pcDNA3 expression vectors containing the N-terminal Myc epitope tag. Myc-tagged FLIPCys/Ala was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Authenticity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions at 80–90% confluency. The amount of DNA was normalized in all transfection experiments with pcDNA3. Expression of proteins was verified by Western blotting or immunoprecipitation. Caspase and Apoptosis Assays—Caspase-8 activity was determined by fluorometric assay using the substrate IETD-AMC, which is specifically cleaved by the enzyme at the Asp residue to release the fluorescent leaving group, AMC. Cell extracts containing 50 μg of protein were incubated with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm caspase substrate in a total reaction volume of 0.25 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, the liberated fluorescent group AMC was determined fluorometrically at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Apoptosis was determined by incubating the cells with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min and scoring the percentage of cells having intensely condensed chromatin and/or fragmented nuclei by UV microscopy using the Pixera software (Leica, Germany). NO Detection—The production of NO was assessed by flow cytometry using a fluorescent probe, 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, cells (1 × 106/ml) were loaded with 10 μm 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate for 30 min at 37 °C, after which they were thoroughly washed. A FACSort (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer equipped with a 488-nm argon ion laser and supplied with the Cell Quest software was applied to measure NO levels in the cells. Signals were obtained using a 538-nm bandpass filter. Each determination is based on mean fluorescence intensity of 5000 cells. Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts were performed by incubating the cells in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a commercial protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 20 min on ice. After insoluble debris was pelletted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and determined for protein content using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Proteins (40 μg) were resolved on a reducing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The transferred membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered Tween (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed 3 times with Tris-buffered Tween for 10 min and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled isotype-specific secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using analyst/PC densitometry software (Bio-Rad). Mean densitometry data from independent experiments were normalized to result in cells in the control. The data were presented as the mean ± S.D. and analyzed by Student's t test. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed after treatments with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected and determined for protein content. Cell lysates containing 60 μg of protein were incubated with 12 μl of anti-Myc-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted with 12 μl of Sepharose for 6 h at 4°C. The immune complexes were then washed 3 times with 20 volumes of lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates containing ∼20 μg of protein equivalents were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as described. FasL Induces Apoptosis and Caspase-8 Activation in BEAS-2B Cells—FasL has been reported to induce apoptosis in sensitive cells, including lung epithelial cells (32Fine A. Anderson N.L. Rothstien T.L.

To study the role of NO in Fas-mediated apoptosis, we first characterized cell death response to FasL treatment in lung epithelial BEAS cells using Hoechst 33342 and caspase assays. Treatment of the cells with FasL caused a dose-dependent increase in cell apoptosis over control levels, as indicated by increased nuclear fluorescence and chromatin condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 1). Approximately 8% of the treated cells showed apoptotic nuclear morphology at the FasL concentration of 50 ng/ml with the cell death response exceeding 25% at 250 ng/ml. Significant apoptotic response was observed as early as 6 h and peaked at about 16 h post-treatment (data not shown). Because FasL is known to induce apoptosis through a caspase-8-dependent pathway (3Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar, 4Takahashi T. Tanaka M. Brannan C.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Suda T. Nagata S. Cell. 1994; 76: 969-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of FasL treatment on caspase-8 activity using fluorogenic caspase-8 substrate IETD-AMC. Consistent with the Hoechst apoptosis assay, our results indicated that FasL was able to increase the activity of caspase-8 in BEAS cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone (10 μm) potently suppressed FasL-induced apoptosis and caspase-8 activation (data not shown), further supporting an apoptotic mechanism. Nitric Oxide Inhibits FasL-induced Apoptosis and Caspase-8 Activation—NO has been reported to have both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects on cells depending on cell type, redox status, and stimulating agents (23Davis K.L. Martin E. Turko I.V. Murad F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 203-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 24Kolb J.P. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Klein J.A. Ackerman S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In this study we found that NO has an inhibitory effect on FasL-induced cell death in lung epithelial BEAS cells. Co-treatment of the cells with FasL and NO donor, SNP or DPTA NONOate, significantly inhibited apoptosis compared with the FasL-treated control (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the NO inhibitor AG or PTIO promoted this effect (Fig. 2A). The NO modulators, when used alone at the indicated concentrations, had no significant effect on cell death (not shown), indicating that FasL was required for the induction of apoptosis under the test conditions. To test whether the apoptosis-modulating effect of NO was mediated through the death receptor signaling pathway, cells were similarly treated with FasL and NO modulators, and cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for caspase-8 activity. Fig. 2B shows that the NO donors, SNP and DPTA NONOate, were able to inhibit caspase-8 activation by FasL, whereas the NO inhibitors, AG and PTIO, promoted the FasL effect. Because AG is an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase, our results suggest that FasL was able to induce NO production, and AG was able to inhibit it. To test this possibility and to determine the NO modulating effect of other test agents, BEAS cells were treated with FasL in the presence or absence of various NO donors and inhibitors, and their effect on cellular NO levels was determined by flow cytometry using NO-specific probe 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate. As expected, FasL was able to increase DAF fluorescence intensity over control levels, and the NO inhibitors AG and PTIO suppressed this signal (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the NO donors SNP and DPTA NONOate promoted the NO-inducing effect of FasL. FasL Induces FLIP Down-regulation and Its Inhibition by Nitric Oxide—In searching for a mechanism that might explain the apoptosis regulatory effect of NO on FasL-induced cell death, we examined by immunoblotting the expression levels of key proteins known to be relevant to the mechanisms of Fas signaling, including the Fas death receptor, the adapter protein FADD, and the anti-apoptotic FLIP, which is known to bind caspase 8 and FADD and suppress apoptosis induction by death ligands (14Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J.

Among these, only the level of FLIP was affected by the FasL treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figs. 3, A and B). In the cell line tested, only the long isoform of FLIP (FLIPL) could be detected, whereas the short FLIPS protein was undetectable. Because FLIPs have been reported to be down-regulated via the ubiquitin proteasome-dependent pathway under different conditions, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ligand and p53 activation, chemotherapeutic administration, and adenoviral infection (37Fukazawa T.

Cells were treated with lactacystin, a highly specific proteasome inhibitor, and its effect on FasL-induced FLIP down-regulation was examined by Western blot analysis. Fig. 3A shows that lactacystin was able to inhibit FLIP down-regulation, indicating proteasomal degradation of FLIP by FasL. The result was confirmed by the fact that another proteasome inhibitor, MG132, also inhibited the decrease in FLIP expression caused by FasL (data not shown). These results along with subsequent data showing the effect of FasL on FLIP ubiquitination support the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in FasL-induced degradation of FLIP. To test whether NO might modulate Fas signaling through FLIP, cells were treated with FasL in the presence or absence of NO donors or inhibitors, and their effect on FLIP expression levels was determined by immunoblotting. Fig. 3B shows that the addition of the NO donor SNP or DPTA NONOate strongly increased FLIP levels over FasL-treated control, whereas the NO inhibitor AG showed an opposite effect. These results along with our earlier finding on the protective effect of NO on FasL-induced cell death (Fig. 2) suggest that NO may mediate its anti-apoptotic effect by interfering with the FLIP degradation mechanism. FasL Induces FLIP Ubiquitination and Its Inhibition by Nitric Oxide—Because the proteasome acts on proteins destined to be degraded by ubiquitination, we investigated whether FLIP ubiquitination is induced by FasL. Immunoprecipitation studies were performed in cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding ubiquitin and Myc-tagged FLIP, and the resulting immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody. Fig. 4 shows that in the absence of FasL stimulation, minimum ubiquitinated FLIP was produced. Upon FasL treatment, the ubiquitin-FLIP conjugate was greatly increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4). This effect could be observed as early as 1 h and peaked at 2 h after FasL treatment. Pretreatment of the cells with NO donors, SNP, or DPTA NONOate potently inhibited FasL-induced ubiquitination of FLIP, whereas the NO inhibitors AG and PTIO enhanced this ubiquitination process (Fig. 4). These results suggest that NO was able to inhibit FLIP ubiquitination, thus preventing its degradation by the proteasome. Nitric Oxide Induces S-Nitrosylation of FLIP and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination—Increasing evidence indicates that NO plays an important role in apoptosis through S-nitrosylation of several key apoptosis regulatory proteins (41Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 42Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). To determine whether NO could nitrosylate FLIP, which has not previously been demonstrated, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments evaluating the effect NO on S-nitrosylation of FLIP. Cells expressing ectopic myc-FLIP were treated with FasL and NO modulators, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blot using anti-S-nitrosocysteine antibody. Fig. 5 shows that in the absence of NO modulators, FasL had minimal effect on S-nitrosylation of FLIP. However, upon the addition of the NO donors, SNP or DPTA NONOate, the nitrosylated level of FLIP was strongly increased. In contrast, the NO inhibitors, AG or PTIO, inhibited this nitrosylation. These results suggest that S-nitrosylation may be a key mechanism utilized by NO to regulate FLIP ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The Caspase-like Domain Is a Target for S-Nitrosylation of FLIP—To study the mechanism of S-nitrosylation of FLIP, we first determined which domain(s) of FLIP is responsible for its nitrosylation. We constructed a series of FLIP deletion and mutation plasmids (Δ1-Δ4) and tested their effect on S-nitrosylation by NO (Fig. 6). Partial deletion of the caspase-like domain of FLIP (amino acids 329–480, Δ1) had no effect on S-nitrosylation induced by the NO donor SNP, whereas complete deletion of this domain (Δ2) as well as the death effector domain 2 (Δ3) strongly inhibited this effect when the plasmid"

These studies were performed to characterize the mechanisms by which Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated NF-κB activation promotes resistance to cell death in macrophages. When NF-κB activation was inhibited by a super-repressor, IκBα, the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide induced the activation of caspase 8, the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), and apoptotic cell death in macrophages. The inhibition of caspase 8 activation suppressed DNA fragmentation but failed to protect macrophages against the loss of ΔΨm and resulted in necrotic cell death. In contrast, the reduction of receptor-interacting protein 1 suppressed the loss of ΔΨm and inhibited apoptotic cell death. Further, when caspase 8 activation was suppressed, the knock down of receptor-interacting protein inhibited the loss of ΔΨm and necrotic cell death. These observations demonstrate that following TLR4 ligation by lipopolysaccharide, NF-κB is a critical determinant of macrophage life or death, whereas caspase 8 determines the pathway employed.

Apoptosis may be initiated by two different pathways, the death receptor-mediated pathway and the mitochondria-dependent pathway. Death receptors, such as Fas and TNFR1, possess intracellular death domains that may initiate apoptosis through the recruitment of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and the activation of caspase 8. Activated caspase 8 may directly activate caspase 3, which results in apoptotic cell death (reviewed in Ref. 9Pope R.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In the mitochondria-dependent pathway, apoptotic signals induce the loss of mitochondrial integrity and the release of pro-apoptotic molecules, including cytochrome c. Once in the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to apoptotic protease activating factor-1, resulting in activation of caspases 9 and 3, thus triggering apoptosis (10Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). These two pathways may be linked by the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid, which may be cleaved by caspase 8, resulting in truncated Bid (tBid), which may trigger the mitochondrial pathway. Although TLR4 ligation induces NF-κB activation, which may promote cell survival through the induction of anti-apoptotic genes, recent evidence has demonstrated that TLR4 activation may also result in macrophage apoptosis (11Lakics V.

Additionally, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP), which is important for TNFR1- or TLR3-induced NF-κB activation (17Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P.

Therefore, studies were performed to define the role of caspase 8 and RIP in LPS-induced macrophage cell death when NF-κB activation is inhibited. Employing in vitro monocyte-differentiated macrophages, the current study has demonstrated that, following the inhibition of NF-κB activation, LPS induced caspase 8 activation and apoptotic cell death. In contrast to expectations, the inhibition of caspase 8 did not prevent the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and macrophage viability was not reduced. Additionally, when caspase 8 activation was suppressed, the mode of cell death was non-apoptotic. Our data suggest that RIP mediated not only apoptotic, but also the non-apoptotic, death of macrophages by different mechanisms. Further, caspase 8 was critical in determining the mode of cell death through its effects on RIP. Materials—LPS and polymyxin B sulfate were obtained from Sigma.

Where indicated, macrophages were co-infected with Ad DN FADD (5 m.o.i.), Ad Bcl-xL (6 m.o.i.), AdCrmA (25 m.o.i.) or Ad control (5, 6, or 25 m.o.i., respectively). Within each experiment the total concentration of adenoviral vector was held constant. After infection, 20% FBS/RPMI was added, and the cells were incubated overnight. The macrophages were then washed and incubated in 20% FBS/RPMI for an additional 12 h (total of 32 h from the initiation of the infection). The infected cells were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml) or control medium for 12 or 24 h. The cells were then harvested and analyzed as described. Cell Transfection—In vitro differentiated macrophages were transfected with either nonspecific or RIP siRNA (final, 100 nm; Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO) employing Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). The cells were then incubated for 72 h prior to analysis by immunoblot assay or adenoviral infection. Electron Microscopy—In vitro differentiated macrophages cultured in the presence or absence of Ad IκBα, LPS, and IETD were harvested, and cell pellets were fixed overnight at 4 °C in a 0.2 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2% glutaraldehyde. Samples were post-fixed in cacodylate-buffered 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon 812 (Nacalai Tesque, Osaka, Japan) for ultrathin sectioning.

Cultures were incubated with Rh123 (0.1 μg/ml) for 30 min, harvested, and washed by PBS. To assess cell membrane integrity simultaneously, PI (3.3 μg/ml) was added to the cells prior to analysis by flow cytometry. For histogram analysis, objects with minimal light scatter representing debris were gated out.

Immunoblot Analysis—Whole-cell extracts were prepared from 7-day differentiated macrophages that were treated as indicated. Extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by semidry blotting. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS/0.2% Tween 20/5% nonfat dry milk (PBS/Tween/milk). The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS/Tween/milk with the indicated antibodies: anti-caspase 3, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-RIP (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), anti-caspase 8 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or anti-tubulin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Membranes were washed in PBS/Tween/milk and incubated with either donkey anti-rabbit (1:5000) or anti-mouse (1:2000) secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Visualization of the protein bands was performed employing the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Caspase Activity Assay—Seven-day differentiated human macrophages were treated as indicated and harvested. Cell lysates were prepared as instructed by the manufacturer. The lysates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the caspase 8 (Ac-IETD-AFC) synthetic fluorogenic substrate. Samples were read on a fluorometer at 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission. Caspase Inhibition—Macrophages were infected with control or IκBα-expressing adenoviral vectors as described above. The cells were then pretreated for 1 h with broad specificity caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (20 μm) or the caspase 8 inhibitor IETD-fmk (20 μm) (Enzyme System Products, Livermore, CA) or vehicle control Me2SO, followed by culture with 10 ng/ml LPS for an additional 12 h. The cells were harvested and the lysates examined as described under “Results.” Statistical Analysis—Statistical significances between groups were determined by two-tailed Student's t-test. LPS Induces Macrophage Apoptosis following NF-κB Inhibition—To characterize the mechanism of LPS-induced apoptosis following NF-κB inhibition, in vitro differentiated human macrophages were infected with a control adenoviral vector or one expressing a super-repressor IκBα (Ad IκBα) that possesses serine-to-alanine mutations that retard its degradation (32Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). LPS (10 ng/ml)-induced cell death, determined by the loss of cell membrane integrity using the PI exclusion assay (Fig. 1A), was significantly increased at 12 h and further increased at 24 h in macrophages infected with Ad IκBα compared with those infected with the control adenoviral vector (p <0.001). The mode of cell death was apoptotic, defined by DNA fragmentation (<2N DNA) (Fig. 1B), which also increased from 12 to 24 h (p <0.001). Apoptotic cell death was accompanied by the loss of ΔΨm, determined by the Rh123 retention assay (Fig. 1C). The ΔΨm was greatly reduced by 12 h, with further reduction by 24 h, suggesting an important role for the loss of mitochondrial integrity in LPS-induced cell death. These observations demonstrate that LPS induced the loss of ΔΨm and macrophage apoptotic cell death when NF-κB activation was inhibited. LPS-induced Apoptosis following NF-κB Inhibition Is Not Mediated by TNFR1—We previously demonstrated that when NF-κB activation was inhibited TNFα induced macrophage apoptosis (25Liu H. Ma Y. Pagliari L.J. Perlman H. Yu C. Lin A. Pope R.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1907-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because LPS induces the production of TNFα, we next examined whether TNFα was involved in LPS-induced macrophage apoptosis. TNFα signals through two separate receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNFR1 contains a death domain that mediates apoptosis through the activation of caspase 8 (33Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5141) Google Scholar, 34Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar). Macrophages were infected with Ad IκBα or the control adenoviral vector and then incubated with a neutralizing anti-TNFR1 antibody for 1 h before the addition of LPS or TNFα. Although the neutralizing antibody significantly (p <0.01) reduced TNFα-mediated apoptotic cell death (Fig. 2, A–C), it had no impact on LPS-induced cell death (Fig. 2A), DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2B), and the loss of ΔΨm (Fig. 2C) in macrophages infected with Ad IκBα. These results demonstrate that LPS-induced apoptosis in macrophages was not mediated by TNFR1. Caspase 8 Is Necessary for LPS-induced DNA Fragmentation but Not Mitochondrial Dysfunction or Cell Death—Because previous studies demonstrated that caspase 8 was activated by LPS when NF-κB activation was suppressed (16Ruckdeschel K. Pfaffinger G. Haase R. Sing A. Weighardt H. Hacker G. Holzmann B. Heesemann J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the role of caspase 8 was examined. Macrophages were infected with the control adenoviral vector or Ad IκBα and then treated with LPS for 12 h. Cells were harvested, and the lysates were analyzed for caspase 8 activation employing a substrate-specific fluorometric assay. Compared with the control-infected macrophages, LPS induced a 10–15-fold activation of caspase 8-like activity when NF-κB activation was inhibited (Fig. 3A). Because the caspase 8 inhibitor IETD-fmk suppressed >90% of the LPS-induced caspase 8-like activity (Fig. 3A), this inhibitor was employed to define the effects of caspase 8 inhibition on apoptotic cell death. The inhibition of caspase 8-like activity with IETD-fmk markedly suppressed LPS-induced DNA fragmentation following NF-κB inhibition (Fig. 3B). In contrast, IETD-fmk did not protect macrophages from the loss of ΔΨm (Fig. 3C) or cell death (Fig. 3D), which actually increased. To define the mode of cell death, electron microscopy was performed. Macrophages infected with Ad IκBα and treated with IETD-fmk plus LPS demonstrated characteristics of necrotic cell death, including vacuolization of the cytoplasm, ruptured cell membrane, and lack of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3E). Bcl-xL Protects against Apoptosis, Not Necrosis—To further define the role of the mitochondria in LPS-induced apoptosis, Bcl-xL was ectopically expressed, employing an adenoviral vector (Ad Bcl-xL) in macrophages co-infected with Ad IκBα or Ad control. In macrophages infected with Ad IκBα, ectopically expressed Bcl-xL (Fig. 3B) significantly (p <0.001) suppressed the LPS-induced DNA fragmentation, loss of ΔΨm (Fig. 3C), and cell death (Fig. 3D). Macrophages were also examined to define the effects of Bcl-xL, when caspase 8 activity was also blocked. The combination of IETD-fmk plus Bcl-xL completely prevented DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the protection provided by Bcl-xL against the loss of ΔΨm and the induction of cell death was lost when caspase 8 activity was suppressed (Fig. 3, C and D). Therefore, Bcl-xL protected against apoptotic, but not against non-apoptotic or necrotic, cell death. These observations suggest that caspase 8 activation regulates the mode of LPS-induced macrophage cell death when NF-κB activation is repressed. FADD Is Upstream of Caspase 8—An earlier study suggested that TLR4-induced apoptosis was mediated through FADD (12Haase R. Kirschning C.J. Sing A. Schrottner P. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Wagner H. Heesemann J. Ruckdeschel K. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4294-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, studies were performed to determine the effect of a dominant negative (DN) FADD on caspase 8-like activity and on apoptosis. The adenoviral-mediated expression of a DN FADD suppressed caspase 8-like activity (Fig. 4A), suggesting that FADD was upstream of caspase 8 in LPS-induced apoptosis. Consistent with its effects on caspase 8, the expression of the DN FADD also suppressed LPS-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the DN FADD failed to prevent either cell death or the loss of ΔΨm (data not shown), consistent with the results observed with IETD-fmk. These observations suggest that FADD is upstream of caspase 8, which contributes to the apoptotic phenotype. RIP Contributes to LPS-induced Macrophage Apoptotic Cell Death— Because RIP may contribute to TNFα-induced non-apoptotic cell death (35Lin Y. Devin A. Rodriguez Y. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) and because activated caspase 8 may cleave RIP, the effect of LPS-induced caspase 8 activation on RIP expression was examined. LPS induced the cleavage of RIP when NF-κB activation was inhibited, and this was prevented when caspase 8 activity was suppressed by IETD-fmk (Fig. 5A). To further define the role of RIP in TLR4-mediated apoptosis, the expression of RIP was suppressed employing siRNA (Fig. 5B). Compared with nonspecific control siRNA, the reduction of RIP resulted in protection against LPS-induced cell death (Fig. 5B). Further, the suppression of RIP also protected against DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5C) and the loss of ΔΨm (Fig. 5D). These observations demonstrate that even though LPS-induced caspase 8 activation was capable of cleaving RIP, RIP contributed to TLR4-mediated apoptotic cell death. RIP Contributes to Caspase 8 Activation—Because earlier studies suggested that RIP may be upstream of caspase 8 in TLR4 signaling (19Han K.J. Su X. Xu L.G. Bin L.H. Zhang J. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15652-15661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of the reduction of RIP on caspase activation. Macrophages were incubated with geldanamycin, which dissociates RIP from HSP90, resulting in the reduction of RIP by proteasomal degradation (36Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C. Sessa W.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13791-13796Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 37Chan F.K. Shisler J. Bixby J.G. Felices M.

Geldanamycin pretreatment for 12 h resulted in a marked reduction of RIP (Fig. 6A). When RIP was reduced employing geldanamycin, caspase 8-like activity was suppressed (Fig. 6B). When examined by Western blot, the reduction of RIP was also associated with a marked decrease of activated p18 caspase 8 (Fig. 6C). In contrast, partially processed p41/43 caspase 8 was equivalent in the presence or absence of geldanamycin (Fig. 6C). Consistent with the effects on caspase 8 activation, the processing of Bid, which is downstream of caspase 8, was suppressed in the presence of geldanamycin (Fig. 6C). These observations suggest that RIP mediates TLR4-induced caspase 8 activation in macrophages. RIP Mediates Non-apoptotic Death in Macrophages—Studies were performed to determine the effects of RIP on non-apoptotic cell death. The reduction of RIP by geldanamycin, as with the RIP siRNA, resulted in suppression (p <0.05) not only of the apoptotic phenotype (Fig. 7A) but also the loss of ΔΨm (Fig. 7B) and cell death (Fig. 7C). To suppress caspase 8, an adenoviral vector expressing CrmA was employed to co-infect macrophages with the Ad IκBα. Inhibition of caspase 8 with CrmA protected against DNA fragmentation (Fig. 7A) but failed to protect against the loss of ΔΨm (Fig. 7B) or the loss of membrane integrity (Fig. 7C) mediated by LPS, similar to the results observed with IETD-fmk or the DN FADD. In contrast, when RI"
https://openalex.org/W2151172155,"The PI3K/PTEN/Akt signaling pathway has emerged in recent years as a main player in human cancers, increasing proliferation and decreasing apoptosis of transformed cells, and thus becoming a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Our previous data have demonstrated that Akt-mediated signaling is of a key relevance in the mouse skin carcinogenesis system, one of the best-known models of experimental carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the involvement of several pathways as mediators of Akt-induced increased proliferation and tumorigenesis in keratinocytes. Tumors produced by subcutaneous injection of Akt-transformed keratinocytes showed increased Foxo3a phosphorylation, but no major alterations in p21(Cip1/WAF1), p27(Kip1) or mdm2 expression and/or localization. In contrast, we found increased expression and nuclear localization of DeltaNp63, beta-catenin and Lef1. Concomitantly, we also found increased expression of c-myc and CycD1, targets of the beta-catenin/Tcf pathway. Such increase is associated with increased phosphorylation and stabilization of c-myc protein as well as increased translation of c-myc and CycD1 due to mTOR activation. Using immunohistochemistry approaches in samples of oral dysplasias and human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, we confirmed that increased Akt activation significantly correlates with increased DeltaNp63 and CycD expression, c-myc phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Akt is able to transform keratinocytes by specific mechanisms involving transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes."
https://openalex.org/W2086941386,"Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive soft tissue tumor characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation between chromosome 18 and X. This translocation can generate a fusion transcript encoding SYT-SSX1, a transforming oncoprotein. We present evidence that SYT-SSX1 induces insulin-like growth factor II expression in fibroblast cells. SYT-SSX2, a fusion also frequently found in synovial sarcoma, is necessary for maintaining Igf2 expression in the synovial sarcoma cell line, and the increased IGF2 synthesis protects cells from anoikis and is required for tumor formation in vivo. We also found a loss of imprinting (LOI) for Igf2 in a limited number of primary synovial sarcomas despite demethylation of CpG dinucleotides critical for maintaining imprinting. These findings suggest that inhibition of the IGF2/IGF1-R signaling pathway may represent a significant therapeutic modality for treating synovial sarcoma."

We demonstrated that IgG exposure to pro-oxidative ferrous ions or to reactive oxygen species enhances paratope flexibility and hydrophobicity, leading to expansion of the spectrum of recognized antigens, regulation of cell proliferation, and protection in experimental sepsis. We propose that ferrous ions, released from transferrin and ferritin at sites of inflammation, synergize with reactive oxygen species to modify the immunoglobulins present in the surrounding microenvironment, thus quenching pro-inflammatory signals, while facilitating neutralization of pathogens.

We propose that ferrous ions, released from transferrin and ferritin at sites of inflammation, synergize with reactive oxygen species to modify the immunoglobulins present in the surrounding microenvironment, thus quenching pro-inflammatory signals, while facilitating neutralization of pathogens. The immune system is capable of producing a large and diverse repertoire of antibodies that can recognize a wide variety of different molecular structures and conformations. Three models for antibody-antigen interactions have been described, differing by the role of molecular flexibility. The “lock-and-key” model proposes binding between geometrically optimized partners without substantial structural alterations. In contrast, antibodies that recognize epitopes according to the “induced fit” model undergo significant structural reorganization upon binding, resulting in increased antibody-antigen complementarity (1Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 2Wedemayer G.J. Patten P.A. Wang L.H. Schultz P.G. Stevens R.C.

Although the first model is typical for antigen recognition by affinity-matured antibodies, the second one is intrinsic for germ line antibodies (2Wedemayer G.J. Patten P.A. Wang L.H. Schultz P.G.

The “conformational isomerism” model proposes that a single antibody molecule may adopt several different binding site conformations, independently of the presence of the antigen. These antibody isomers exist in equilibrium and each may recognize unrelated antigens (6Foote J. Milstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10370-10374Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7James L.C. Roversi P. Tawfik D.S. Science. 2003; 299: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 8James L.C.

Biol. 2005; 347: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); i.e. such an antibody is polyspecific. Polyspecific antibodies in healthy individuals represent >20% of all circulating antibodies. They play a major role in preventing pathogen dissemination in pre-immune organisms through enhanced antigen trapping (11Ochsenbein A.F. Fehr T. Lutz C. Suter M. Brombacher F. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Science. 1999; 286: 2156-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), a property attributed to their ability to bind multiple unrelated antigens (12Notkins A.L. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, polyspecificity of a fraction of IgG antibodies, present in all healthy individuals, can be induced in vitro by transient exposure to protein-destabilizing agents (low or high pH, high salt concentration, or chaotropic agents) (13McMahon M.J. O'Kennedy R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 241: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Bouvet J.P. Stahl D. Rose S. Quan C.P. Kazatchkine M.D. Kaveri S.V. J. Autoimmun. 2001; 16: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), without concomitant denaturation of the immunoglobulin molecules. Thus, in their native state, these IgGs recognize a limited panel of antigens, but exposure to the destabilizing agents leads to a dramatic expansion of the spectrum of recognized antigens. The molecular mechanism and the biological significance of this “hidden” polyspecificity remain unclear. It is also not known whether this phenomenon occurs in vivo and whether the highly aggressive microenvironment present in inflammation sites could affect antigen binding of circulating immunoglobulin molecules.In response to pathogens, professional phagocytes generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciespIgGnormal human polyclonal IgGPHA-Mphytohemagglutinin M.2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciespIgGnormal human polyclonal IgGPHA-Mphytohemagglutinin M. which have potent bactericidal activity (15Lambeth J.D.

Swaak A.J. van Eijk H.G. Koster J.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1988; 4: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) or transferrin-bound iron ions (17Brieland J.K. Fantone J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further, free iron ions may play an important role in exacerbating the reactive oxygen cascades (18Morris C.J. Earl J.R. Trenam C.W. Blake D.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Pierre J.L. Fontecave M. Biometals. 1999; 12: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that ROS and/or iron ions in inflammation sites may influence the antigen-binding properties of immunoglobulin molecules present in this microenvironment. The present study was undertaken to test this hypothesis and to get a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for antibody polyspecificity. Our data show that the exposure to ferrous ions or to ROS results in the potentiation of antigen-binding and anti-inflammatory activities of IgG. These effects are associated with an increase in antigen-binding site plasticity and hydrophobicity as shown by kinetic and thermodynamic analyses, fluorescence spectroscopy, and pH scanning analysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESImmunoglobulin Preparations—A polyclonal therapeutic intravenous immunoglobulin (pIgG) preparation (Intraglobin F) was obtained from Biotest AG. F(ab′)2 fragments from pIgG were obtained by pepsin proteolysis and chromatography on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the product was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fc fragments from pIgG was a kind gift from Dr. Marianne Debré (Hospital Necker, Paris, France) (20Debre M. Bonnet M.C. Fridman W.H. Carosella E. Philippe N. Reinert P. Vilmer E. Kaplan C.

The M061 hybridoma, secreting a human IgG1 antibody to the cytomegalovirus polypeptide 65-kDa matrix antigen, was a gift from Dr. M. Ohlin (Lund University, Lund, Sweden). The Z2 hybridoma, producing a mouse IgG2b antibody to mouse IgG2a (21Fazekas G. Rajnavolgyi E. Kurucz I. Sintar E. Kiss K. Laszlo G. Gergely J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2719-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the IP2–11-1 hybridoma, producing a mouse IgG2a, were kindly provided by Dr. Eva Rajnavolgyi, (Department of Immunology, University of Lorand Eötvös, Budapest, Hungary). The hybridomas were cultured in protein-free medium in a bioreactor. Exposure of the immunoglobulin preparation to metal ions and UV light as well as determination of immunoreactivities by immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and pH scanning analyses are described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.”Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—The kinetic constants of the interactions between the mouse Z2 IgG2b antibody and its target antigen (mouse IgG2a) were determined using the BIAcore 2000 surface plasmon resonance-based system (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). Purified mouse IgG2a was immobilized on research grade CM5 sensor chips using the amino-coupling kit (Biacore). IgG2a immobilization yielded a shift of ∼3000 resonance units in the base line. The control flow cells were prepared by activation and subsequent deactivation of the carboxylated dextran matrix without the addition of proteins. All solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm filters and degassed under vacuum before use. All of the experiments were performed using HEPES-buffered saline (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% v/v polysorbate) as running and sample dilution buffers. Concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 nm native or Fe(II)-treated mouse monoclonal Z2 antibody were injected on the immobilized monoclonal IgG2a. Different combinations of flow rates and association/dissociation times were used (association times: 4, 6, or 7 min; dissociation times: 5 or 7 min; and flow rates: 10 or 20 μl/min) to limit the effect of mass transport and sample dispersion. The chip surface was regenerated using a 3 m solution of potassium thiocyanate. All measurements were performed in at least three independent experiments at temperatures of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C. The binding to the surface of the control flow cell was subtracted from the binding to the antigen-coated cells. BIAevaluation, version 4.1, software (Biacore) was used for the calculation of the kinetic rate constants of association (kon), of dissociation (koff), and of the equilibrium constants of dissociation (KD) and association (KA). The global analyses of each data set were performed using kinetic models, included in the software, yielding the fits with the lowest value of χ2 (<1). Langmuir-type interactions were used to calculate the kinetic constants. The evaluation of thermodynamic parameters is described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.”Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Intrinsic emission spectra measurements of the native and Fe(II)-exposed mouse monoclonal Z2 antibody were performed using a MPF-44 spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Shelton, CT). All analyses were carried out at 25 °C using quartz cuvettes. The samples were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to a final concentration of 6.67 μm. The wavelength of 280 nm, which excites both tyrosine and tryptophan residues, was used for the fluorescence spectra measurements. The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 290 and 400 nm. The excitation and emission slits were both 10 nm, and the scan speed was 1000 nm/min.Chemiluminescence Analyses—Lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence was monitored with an LKB-Wallac 1250 Luminometer (LKB-Wallac, Turku, Finland) at 25 °C. The analyses were performed in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9, containing 0.5 mg/ml lucigenin and 67 μm pIgG. The measurements started immediately after the addition of ferrous ions (final concentration 0.5 mm). In some cases, CuZn-superoxide dismutase or crystalline bovine liver catalase (both from Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the reaction buffer to a final concentration of 1 units/ml or 40 units/ml, respectively.Oxidation of Indigo Carmine—The analyses were performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 30 μm of indigo carmine (Sigma-Aldrich) as described in the literature (22Wentworth Jr., P. McDunn J.E. Wentworth A.D. Takeuchi C. Nieva J. Jones T. Bautista C. Ruedi J.M. Gutierrez A. Janda K.D. Babior B.M. Eschenmoser A. Lerner R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). pIgG at a final concentration of 67 μm, ferrous ions at final concentration of 1 mm, or both simultaneously were added to the reaction buffer. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, absorption at 610 nm was measured.Effect of Activated Neutrophils on Immunoreactivity of pIgG—Heparinized blood from a healthy donor was overlaid over a Ficoll Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia) gradient and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and then 3% dextran 100 solution was added. After 20 min of incubation at 25 °C, the neutrophil-rich fraction was decanted, centrifuged, and subjected to hypotonic lysis for elimination of residual erythrocytes. The latter treatment was repeated three times. Neutrophils were suspended to 2 × 107 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 6.7 μm pIgG, transferred to the wells of culture plates, and half were stimulated for 15 min at 37 °C by adding 1 μg/ml phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma-Aldrich). After the incubation, the pIgG-containing supernatants were separated from the cells by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and Pefabloc (0.1 mm) was added. The generation of ROS by the stimulated cells was confirmed by the bleaching of indigo carmine added to the medium of selected wells (not shown). The samples were stored at -20 °C until immunoreactivities were analyzed by immunoblotting as described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.”Mitogen-induced T Cell Proliferation—Heparinized venous blood from a healthy donor was used for the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Ficoll gradient separation. The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 106 cells/ml, and 0.1 ml of the suspension was transferred to the wells of 96-well round bottom plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). PHA-M (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. After incubation for 6 h at 37°C in 5% CO2, native or Fe(II)-exposed pIgG were added (to a final concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mg/ml). After additional culturing for 60 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the cells were pulsed with [3H]TdR (1 μCi/well) (Amersham Biosciences, Cardiff, UK) and harvested 16 h later. Incorporation of [3H]TdR was measured using a scintillation counter.Escherichia coli-induced Septic Shock—E. coli, strain WF+ (from the Central Research Institute of Experimental Medicine, Jena, Germany) was grown in a tryptic soy broth (Difco) for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested, washed twice in saline, the optical density of the suspension was determined by measuring the absorption at 630 nm, and serial dilutions were plated on agar for counting the colony-forming units. Groups of ten 8–12-week-old outbred female ICR mice were injected intraperitoneal with 0.5 ml of E. coli suspension (1 × 109 cells/ml).RESULTSExposure to Fe(II) Increases Antigen-binding Activity of Immunoglobulin G—Incubation of human polyclonal IgG (pIgG) in the presence of 1 mm ferrous ions (Fe2+) resulted in a significant increase in reactivity with self (Fig. 1, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S1A) and with bacterial (Fig. 1B) antigens, as well as with F(ab′)2 fragments of pIgG (Fig. 1D). In contrast, no increased binding to Fc fragments of IgG was detected (Fig. 1E). Ferric ions (Fe3+) had only a negligible effect on pIgG reactivity (supplemental Fig. S1B), whereas no change was observed upon incubation with cupric, zinc, and manganese ions (data not shown). The increased binding of pIgG remained unchanged after the elimination of residual Fe(II) ions (in the presence of EDTA) and after six months storage at 4 °C, indicating that the increased IgG reactivity was irreversible and independent of the continuous presence of Fe(II). Interestingly, although the polyspecificity of a monoclonal mouse IgG (Z2) specific for mouse IgG2a also increased upon incubation with Fe(II) (supplemental Fig. S1C), binding to their target antigens of immune human pIgG directed to tetanus toxoid (supplemental Fig. S2) and diphtheria toxoid (not shown), and of a human monoclonal IgG directed to cytomegalovirus (Fig. 1A) were not modified, indicating that not all IgG antibodies were equally sensitive to the presence of ferrous ions.Several lines of evidence ruled out the possibility that the observed effects were caused by Fe(II) ion-induced immunoglobulin denaturation: (i) high performance liquid chromatography analysis of pIgG incubated in the presence of 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mm ferrous ions did not show significant deviations in the chromatographic profiles compared with those of native pIgG, demonstrating that the treatment did not result in the formation of IgG aggregates; (ii) Fe(II)-exposed pIgG did not activate the complement (not shown); (iii) not all IgG molecules were equally sensitive to Fe(II), as antibodies generated after repeated immunizations were not affected by the ferrous ions; (iv) despite changes in antigen-binding activity, Fe(II)-exposed monoclonal antibody retained its binding affinity (see below).Effect of ROS on IgG Polyspecificity—It is known that transition metal ions possess potent pro-oxidative properties (23Aust S.D. Morehouse L.A. Thomas C.E. J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). We used lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence analysis to find out whether the pro-oxidative potential of Fe(II) ions was associated with the increased reactivity of ferrous ion-sensitive IgG. We observed that the addition of Fe(II) ions to pIgG resulted in a 10-fold increase in the chemiluminescence signal (Fig. 2A). The suppression of the signal in the presence of superoxide dismutase, but not of catalase, confirmed that superoxide anions were formed in our experimental system. The detected chemiluminescence signal may also have resulted from the formation of other ROS besides the superoxide anion radical. Bleaching of indigo carmine was observed after the addition of ferrous ions to pIgG, confirming the presence of a singlet oxygen or ozone (supplemental Fig. S3). These results prompted us to investigate whether ROS alone was able to influence the antigen-binding properties of antibodies. Generation of ROS by near UV irradiation of a pIgG solution at 360 nm for up to 120 min resulted in a time-dependent increase in antibody immunoreactivity (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the incubation of 6.7 μm solution of pIgG, in the presence of ROS-secreting phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated human neutrophils, also resulted in a significantly increased antibody reactivity to bacterial antigens (Fig. 2C), indicating that ROS released from these inflammatory cells may influence the antigen-binding properties of IgG. Taken together, these results showed the direct effect of ROS on antibody reactivity.FIGURE 2Effect of ROS on pIgG immunoreactivity.

Furthermore, it has been found that transition metal ions and ozone promote tryptophan oxidation into kynurenine or N-formylkynurenine that possess spectral properties different from that of intact tryptophan (26Amici A.

To test whether such modifications occur in IgG after the addition of ferrous ions, we used fluorescence spectroscopy. It was observed that the exposure of the murine Z2 IgG to Fe(II) ions resulted in a shift in the emission maxima and quenching of the fluorescence (Fig. 4B). This result could be explained by ROS-induced covalent modifications of the tryptophan residues.FIGURE 4A, pH-scanning analysis in the acidic and basic range of the interaction of native and Fe(II)-exposed mouse monoclonal Z2 IgG to its target antigen (mouse IgG2a). Binding intensities at different pH are represented in arbitrary units. Each data point represents the mean value ± S.D. of quadruplicate wells in one of three experiments.

The Z2 antibody was selected for this study, as it was shown to bind to a large panel of antigens after contact with Fe(II) ions (supplemental Fig. S1C). The value of the binding affinity of native Z2 IgG for mouse IgG2a, measured at 25 °C, was 142 nm (±14 nm, n = 3), within the range of values with physiological relevance. Interestingly, quite similarly KD (136 nm (±12 nm, n = 3)) was obtained for the Fe(II)-exposed antibody, indicating that the induction of antibody polyspecificity was not associated with a change in the binding affinity. Also no significant differences between KD of the native and of the Fe(II)-exposed Z2 were observed when measured at temperatures of 15, 20, and 30 °C (Fig. S4). In contrast to these results, we found that the association and dissociation kinetic rate constants were strongly affected after the induction of polyspecificity. Thus, exposure to ferrous ions resulted in a significant decrease (∼4-fold at 25 °C) in both rate constants as compared with those seen for the native Z2 IgG (see the supplemental Table). Further, we determined the values of kon and koff as a function of the temperature. Our results demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the rate constants were also affected by Fe(II) exposure. As could be seen on the Arrhenius plots shown in Fig. 3A, both rate constants of polyspecific Z2 are more temperature-sensitive than those of the native Z2. It is important to note that the values of the kinetic rate constants did not change significantly when the density of the immobilized antigen on the chip surface was varied, thus ruling out mass transport or other rebinding artifacts.FIGURE 3Kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the binding of native and Fe(II)-exposed monoclonal Z2 IgG. A, Arrhenius plots representing the temperature dependencies of the association (left graph) and dissociation (right graph) rate constants of native and Fe(II) ion-exposed Z2 IgG. Reported data are means ± S.D. of three independent measurements with at least four analyte concentrations. The slopes were determined by linear regression (correlation coefficient >0.98). B, bar graphs depict changes in enthalpy (left), entropy (center), and Gibbs free energy (right) for the association and dissociation interaction phases and for the equilibrium of native (empty bars) and Fe(II)-exposed Z2 IgG (full bars). Reported values were obtained by applying van't Hoff calculations to the Arrhenius plots shown in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activation energies derived from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots were used for evaluation of the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the association, dissociation, and equilibrium phases of the interactions of the Z2 IgG (Fig. 3B). Unfavorable entropy changes (TΔS) of the association were estimated for both native and for Fe(II)-exposed Z2. The TΔS values differed significantly, being -18.2 ± 0.7 and -27.57 ± 2.37 kcal mol-1, respectively. On the other hand, favorable changes in enthalpy (ΔH) were observed. Here again, the value of this parameter was greater (>2-fold) for the Fe(II)-exposed antibody when compared with the native one (Fig. 3B). However, in both cases the favorable values of ΔH could not overcome the highly unfavorable TΔS values. As seen in Fig. 3B for the phase of dissociation, even more pronounced changes in favorable ΔH and unfavorable TΔS values occurred after the induction of polyspecificity. Finally, the TΔS values at equilibrium were positive (favorable) for both native and Fe(II)-exposed antibodies (7.09 ± 0.91 and 15.35 ± 3 kcal mol-1, respectively). On the other hand, a favorable negative value of ΔH for native Z2 (-2.23 ± 0.28 kcal mol-1) and an unfavorable positive value for Fe(II)-exposed antibodies (5.99 ± 1.18 kcal mol-1) were observed. The resultant equal values for the changes in the free energy (ΔG) at equilibrium (Fig. 3B) are in excellent agreement with the kinetic results, indicating that the binding affinity of the ferrous ion-exposed antibody did not differ from that of the native one.Fe(II) Exposure of IgG Molecules Results in an Enhanced Role of Hydrophobicity in Antigen Binding—A pH scanning analysis in a broad pH range (pH 3–12) was carried out to further examine the interaction between the native and the Fe(II)-exposed Z2 monoclonal antibody with its cognate antigen. The binding curve of the native Z2 IgG was bell-shaped, with apparent inflexed points at pH ∼6 and 9 and a maximum at pH 7 (Fig. 4A). The behavior of the Fe(II)-exposed Z2 was similar to the native one in neutral and alkaline pH regions and completely different at acidic pH. Thus, in the pH range 4.5–8.5, the interaction of the Fe(II)-exposed Z2 was almost pH-independent and reached a plateau with close to the maximal binding (Fig. 4A). The apparent inflexed points were at pH 4.5 and 9.5.Biological Effects of Ferrous Ion-exposed IgG —It has been shown that normal human polyclonal IgG preparations have an inhibitory effect on mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation (30van Schaik I.N.

Introduction of exogenous p53 neither induced apoptosis nor suppressed colony formation in HSC-3 cells lacking any detectable p53 and HSC-4 cells expressing mutant p53R248Q protein. Consistently, exogenous p53 did not induce proapoptotic p53-target genes in these p53-resistant cells. We found that phosphorylation of exogenous p53 on serine 46 (Ser46) was severely impaired in HSC-3 but not HSC-4 cells. A mutant mimicking Ser46-phosphorylation (p53S46D) enhanced proapoptotic Noxa promoter activity, and overcame the resistance to p53-mediated apoptosis and growth suppression in HSC-3 cells. Conversely, a mutant defective for Ser46-phosphorylation (p53S46A) failed to suppress the growth of p53-sensitive HSC-2 cells. In contrast to HSC-3 cells, p53S46D had no effect on HSC-4 cells, and inhibition of endogenous p53R248Q by siRNA restored p53-mediated apoptosis in HSC-4 cells, indicating a dominant-negative effect of p53R248Q protein on wild-type p53 function. These results demonstrate that the defect in Ser46 phosphorylation accounts for the p53 resistance of HSC-3 cells, and provide evidence for a mechanism underlying the acquisition of p53 resistance in oral SCC."
https://openalex.org/W1982985869,"Maf b-Zip transcription factors are involved in both terminal differentiation and oncogenesis. To investigate this apparent contradiction, we used two different primary cell types and performed an extensive analysis of transformation parameters induced by Maf proteins. We show that MafA and c-Maf are potent oncogenes in chicken embryo fibroblasts, while MafB appears weaker. We also provide the first evidence that MafA can confer growth factor independence and promote cell division at low density. Moreover, using MafA as a model, we identified several parameters that are critical for Maf transforming activities. Indeed, MafA ability to induce anchorage-independent cell growth was sensitive to culture conditions. In addition, the transforming activity of MafA was dependent on its phosphorylation state, since mutation on Ser65 impaired its ability to induce growth at low density and anchorage-independent growth. We next examined transforming activity of large Maf proteins in embryonic neuroretina cells, where they are known to induce differentiation. Unlike v-Jun, MafA, MafB and c-Maf did not show oncogenic activity in these cells. Moreover, they counteracted transformation induced by constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway. Taken together, our results show that Maf proteins could display antagonistic functions in oncogenesis depending on the cellular context, and support a dual role for Maf as both oncogenes and tumor suppressor-like proteins."

Besides effects of NO on mitochondrial enzymes and the stimulation of mitochondrial H2O2 production, a NO-dependent increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in several tissues has been reported. It is still obscure whether NO generated by one specific or different NO synthase (NOS) isoenzymes determine such effects. Therefore, we analyzed the amount of mitochondria, respiratory chain enzyme complexes, and citrate synthase in the brain, muscle, heart, kidney, and liver by comparing wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking the neuronal nitric oxide synthase isoform (nNOS-KO). Our results show that the activities of NADH:cytochrome c oxidoreductase and succinate cytochrome c oxidoreductase differ between WT and nNOS-KO mice. However, similar quantities of mitochondria were found in the homogenates of tissues in WT and nNOS-KO animals. Most impressive, higher activities and protein of citrate synthase were found in the brain, muscle, heart, kidney, and liver of nNOS-KO mice. Additionally, higher contents of fatty acid synthase and lipids were determined in the livers of nNOS-KO mice but not in the heart and brain. Furthermore, liver mitochondria from nNOS-KO mice consumed pyruvate at a higher rate and released more citric acid. Our data document a previously unrecognized role of endogenous NO in the regulation of lipid metabolism."

Nine amino acid residues, including six cysteines, one glycine, and a pair of oppositely charged residues Arg/Glu, are conserved in the otherwise diverse sequences of all known mammalian α-defensins. Structural analysis indicates that the two charged residues form a salt bridge, likely stabilizing a protruding loop in the molecule. To investigate the structural and functional roles of the conserved Arg5-Glu13 salt bridge in α-defensins, we chemically prepared human neutrophil α-defensin 2 (HNP2) and five HNP2 analogs, R5E/E13R, E13Q, E13R, R5T/E13Y, and R14A. In contrast to HNP2 and R14A-HNP2, none of the four salt bridge analogs was capable of folding into a native conformation in the context of isolated defensin domains. However, when covalently attached to the 45-residue pro-HNP2 propeptide, the salt bridge analogs of HNP2 in their pro-forms all folded productively, suggesting that the Arg5-Glu13 salt bridge is not required for correct pro-α-defensin folding. When assayed against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, the six α-defensins showed bactericidal activity that correlated with the number of net positive charges carried by individual molecules in the panel, irrespective of whether or not the Arg5-Glu13 salt bridge was decimated, suggesting that Arg5 and Glu13 are not functionally conserved. Proteolytic resistance analysis with human neutrophil elastase, one major protease contained in azurophils with HNPs, revealed that destabilization of the salt bridge dramatically accelerated defensin degradation by the enzyme. Thus, we propose that the Arg5-Glu13 salt bridge found in most mammalian α-defensins is conserved for defensin in vivo stability.

Defensins are a family of cationic antimicrobial mini-proteins expressed predominantly in leukocytes and epithelial cells. They directly inactivate a broad range of microbes presumably through disruption of the anionic microbial membrane, constituting an effective arsenal in the innate immune defense against microbial infection (1Ganz T.

Despite the early discovery of these immunological molecules and a growing recognition of their multifaceted functional roles in innate and adaptive immunity, the sequence rules and structural determinants dictating the antimicrobial activity and specificity of human α-defensins have not yet been established and remain poorly understood. Sequence alignment analysis shows that α-defensins from human, mouse, rhesus macaque, rabbit, rat, and guinea pig share ∼30% sequence identity. Among the totally conserved amino acid residues are six cysteines and one invariant Gly17 (HNP1 numbering, see Fig. 1). In addition, there exists a pair of highly conserved charged residues, Arg5 and Glu13, forming a salt bridge as indicated by structural analysis of various α-defensin molecules. One notable exception is guinea pig neutrophil α-defensins, where the corresponding residues are Thr5 and Tyr13 (20Selsted M.E. Harwig S.S. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2281-2286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An obvious question is: why are certain amino acid residues conserved in the otherwise diverse sequences of all known mammalian α-defensins? The six invariant Cys residues in α-defensins form three intramolecular disulfides, i.e. Cys1-Cys6, Cys2-Cys4, and Cys3-Cys5, thus indispensable for defensin folding and structural stabilization. We have recently shown that the invariant Gly17, located in an atypical, classic-type β-bulge with the backbone torsion angles (ϕ, Ψ) disallowed for l-amino acids but permissible for d-enantiomers, constitutes a signature structural motif (GXC) essential for correct defensin folding (21Xie C.

The structural as well as functional roles of the remaining conserved element in α-defensins, i.e. the Arg5-Glu13 salt bridge, has yet to be elucidated.

Purified (1-45)αCOSR was ligated individually with each HNP2 analog according to the previously published procedures (24Wu Z. Prahl A. Powell R. Ericksen B. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Pept. Res. 2003; 62: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Four resultant ligation products, 74 residues in length, were purified by RP-HPLC to homogeneity and their molecular masses verified by ESI-MS. Oxidative Folding and CNBr Cleavage—The protocols for productive oxidative folding of HNPs and pro-HNPs were previously described (23Wu Z. Powell R. Lu W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2402-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Wu Z. Prahl A. Powell R. Ericksen B. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Pept. Res. 2003; 62: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For R14A-HNP2, the peptide was first dissolved at 1 mg/ml in 8 m urea containing 12 mm reduced and 1.2 mm oxidized glutathione, followed by a 4-fold dilution with 33% N,N-dimethylformamide (v/v) buffered to pH 8.2. For pro-HNP2 analogs, the peptides were each dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in 8 m urea containing 12 mm reduced and 1.2 mm oxidized glutathione, followed by a 4-fold dilution with 0.25 m NaHCO3. The air-tight folding reactions proceeded overnight with gentle stirring at room temperature. All folded products were purified by RP-HPLC to homogeneity, and their molecular masses ascertained by ESI-MS. Chemical release of the four salt bridge analogs of HNP2 from folded prodefensins was achieved by quantitative CNBr cleavage of the only Met-Cys peptide bond connecting the propeptide and the defensin domain. The reactions were carried out at a protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid containing 25 mg/ml CNBr. Released HNP2 analogs were further purified by RP-HPLC and subsequently lyophilized. The molecular masses of the four HNP2 analogs were ascertained by ESI-MS, and, their disulfide connectivity was independently verified by mass mapping of peptide fragments generated by proteolytic digestion as well as Edman degradation according to the published procedures (24Wu Z.

All defensin analogs were quantified by UV absorbance measurements at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients calculated according to the algorithm published by Pace et al. (29Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Antibacterial Activity Assay—Antimicrobial assays against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (Microbiologics) and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (BD Biosciences) were conducted using a previously detailed 96-well turbidimetric method dubbed virtual colony counting (21Xie C.

A 2-fold dilution series of defensin, ranging from 0.5 to 128 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, was used in the dose-dependent survival assay. For salt-dependence experiments, bacteria were exposed to a fixed concentration of defensin at 50 μg/ml for 2 h in the presence of varying concentrations of NaCl (from 5 to 150 mm) before addition of twice-concentrated Mueller-Hinton broth and subsequent measurements of growth kinetics. Proteolytic Resistance Assay—Defensins at 0.5 mg/ml each were incubated at room temperature with human sputum neutrophil elastase (Elastin Products, Inc.) at 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 20 mm CaCl2 and 0.001% Triton X-100, pH 8.3. Aliquots were withdrawn at different time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h) and injected for analysis on RP-HPLC. Percent residual defensin was calculated based on the ratio of the integrated peak areas of an intact molecule at a given time versus at time 0. ESI-MS was used to identify some cleavage products separated by analytical HPLC. Elastase Inhibition Assays—Elastase, prepared as stock at 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mm NaOAc containing 20 mm CaCl2, pH 5.0, was stoichiometrically titrated on a 96-well plate by a previously characterized synthetic protein inhibitor, turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3) (31Lu W. Qasim M.A. Kent S.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8518-8523Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Specifically, the enzyme was freshly diluted to 10 μg/ml, in a total volume of 196 μl, and incubated for 5 min at room temperature with varying concentrations of OMTKY3 in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 20 mm CaCl2 and 0.001% Triton X-100, pH 8.3. Upon addition of 4 μl of the elastase substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide at 10 mg/ml in Me2SO, the enzyme activity, characterized by an increased UV absorbance at 405 nm resulting directly from substrate hydrolysis catalyzed by free elastase in the solution, was continuously monitored spectrophotometrically (OD collected every 6 s for 2 min) on a Amersham Biosciences Vmax microplate reader. Percent residual enzyme activity was defined based on the ratio of the initial reaction rates (ΔAbs/s) obtained from time-dependent hydrolysis kinetics in the presence versus absence of OMTKY3. Potential inhibition by HNP2 at different molar concentrations against a concentration-standardized enzyme was evaluated under identical conditions except that HNP2 in up to 100-fold excess was used. The Salt Bridge Is Important for the Folding of Isolated α-Defensin Domains—Reduced α-defensins are extremely prone to aggregation in solution. We have previously developed a folding protocol that uses 25% N,N-dimethylformamide and 2 m urea in the presence of a reduced/oxidized thiol pair, achieving highly efficient folding of HNP1-3 (23Wu Z. Powell R. Lu W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2402-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because of the small size, α-defensins contain little hydrophobic packing, and are stabilized primarily by three intramolecular disulfide bridges. This unique structural feature renders α-defensins resistant to solvent denaturation, an inherent characteristic of mini-proteins with a small change in surface area upon exposure to high concentrations of chemical denaturants (32Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar). Thus, the key to efficient oxidative folding of HNP1-3 is the use of a “sufficiently denaturing or highly solubilizing” solvent condition to eliminate peptide aggregation, thereby ensuring productive thiol-disulfide exchanges in the folding process. This “folding under denaturing conditions” approach worked exceptionally well for HNPs and a great number of α-defensin analogs (21Xie C. Prahl A. Ericksen B. Wu Z. Zeng P. Li X. Lu W.Y. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32921-32929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Xie C. Zeng P. Ericksen B. Wu Z. Lu W.Y. Lu W. Peptides. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), including R14A-HNP2. However, the four salt bridge analogs of HNP2 all failed to fold into a native conformation using the same approach, characterized by massive peptide precipitation and a highly heterogeneous chromatographic trace of the supernatant with no distinct peaks of meaningful signal intensity. Shown in Fig. 2 is a representative folding reaction of [R5E,E13R]-HNP2 monitored by analytical RP-HPLC. Various attempts to modify the solvent composition of the folding buffer met with little success (data not shown). These results suggest that the Arg5-Glu13 salt bridge is important for the folding of reduced α-defensin domains. The Salt Bridge Is Dispensable for the Folding of Pro-α-defensins—α-Defensins are synthesized in vivo as inactive pro-forms that require proteolytic excision of the propeptide for maturation. In contrast to reduced defensin domains, denatured pro-α-defensins are highly soluble in aqueous solution and can be readily folded using mild solvent conditions (24Wu Z. Prahl A. Powell R. Ericksen B. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Pept. Res. 2003; 62: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The 45-residue anionic propeptide is known to specifically interact, either in trans or in cis, with cationic HNP1-3. Such an interaction is believed to be of electrostatic nature and contributes to the inability of pro-HNPs to kill bacteria and to induce leakage from liposomes (19Valore E.V. Martin E. Harwig S.S. Ganz T. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Wu Z. Prahl A. Powell R. Ericksen B. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Pept. Res. 2003; 62: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the propeptide chaperones the folding of pro-HNPs through two independent mechanisms: solubilization of and interaction with the C-terminal defensin domain. 4Z. Wu, X. Li, B. Ericksen, E. de Leeuw, P. Zeng, C. Xie, C. Li, J. Lubkowski, W-Y. Lu, and W. Lu, submitted for publication. To investigate whether mutations at Arg5 and/or Glu13 have any impact on the folding of pro-α-defensins, we prepared the four salt bridge analogs in the form of pro-HNP2 using native chemical ligation (26Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3217) Google Scholar, 27Dawson P.E. Kent S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 923-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar), and studied their oxidative folding kinetics. As was the case with the previously reported wild type pro-HNP1, the four pro-α-defensin analogs all folded productively with no apparent aggregation. Shown in Fig. 2 is the folding reaction of [R5E,E13R]-HNP2 in its pro-form at 20 h monitored on RP-HPLC. ESI-MS analysis of the folded product showed a mass decrease by 6 units compared with the fully reduced starting material (Fig. 2), indicative of the formation of three disulfide bridges during the folding. Similar results were also obtained with other pro-α-defensin analogs (data not shown). Folded pro-α-defensins, after HPLC purification, were subjected to CNBr cleavage of the Met-Cys peptide bond connecting the propeptide and the C-terminal defensin domain, yielding R5E/E13R-, E13Q-, E13R-, and R5T/E13Y-HNP2 (Fig. 3). The determined molecular masses of these CNBr-released HNP2 analogs are in agreement with the expected values calculated based on their average isotopic compositions (Fig. 3). Peptide mass mapping coupled with complete tryptic/chymotryptic digestion and Edman degradation confirmed the correct disulfide connectivity in these salt bridge analogs of HNP2, i.e. Cys1-Cys6, Cys2-Cys4, and Cys3-Cys5 (data not shown). Our results suggest that the Arg5-Glu13 salt bridge in the context of pro-α-defensins is not required for productive and correct protein folding. The Salt Bridge Is Not Conserved for Antibacterial Activity—To investigate the effect of the Arg5-Glu13 salt bridge on defensin function, we compared the bactericidal activities of all six defensins in the panel against S. aureus and E. coli (Fig. 4). Consistent with our previous observations (21Xie C. Prahl A. Ericksen B. Wu Z. Zeng P. Li X. Lu W.Y. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32921-32929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Ericksen B. Wu Z. Lu W. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob.

Peptides. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), the dose-dependent survival curves for S. aureus are concave-down on log-log scale, suggesting simple exponential killing and the absence of any resistance mechanism. Whereas complete killing was achieved for HNP2, E13R-HNP2, and E13Q-HNP2 against S. aureus within the concentration range used, only E13R-HNP2 produced zero E. coli survival at 128 μg/ml. These results are in general agreement with various findings in the literature that α-defensins more effectively kill Gram-positive strains than Gram-negative bacteria. Antimicrobial virtual lethal doses (vLD) that kill 50, 90, 99, and 99.9% of E. coli and S. aureus input viable cells were tabulated in TABLE ONE.TABLE ONEAntimicrobial virtual lethal doses (vLD, μg/ml) that kill 50, 90, 99, and 99.9% of E. coli and S. aureus input viable cells, as inferred using the virtual colony counting (VCC) procedureDefensinE. coli ATCC 25922S. aureus ATCC 29213vLD50vLD90vLD99VLD99.9vLD50vLD90vLD99vLD99.9HNP24.3 ± 1.010.0 ± 1.321.5 ± 3.487.0 ± 17.82.4 ± 0.711.5 ± 3.730.6 ± 2.759.5 ± 0.5R5E/E13R8.0 ± 2.817.0 ± 3.829.4 ± 1.854.4 ± 5.33.0 ± 0.124.6 ± 3.366.6 ± 3.6>128E13Q6.8 ± 2.711.0 ± 3.819.2 ± 5.845.4 ± 11.24.0 ± 0.28.8 ± 3.111.4 ± 4.454.8 ± 3.1E13R2.5 ± 0.96.9 ± 0.319.3 ± 9.330.7 ± 0.94.4 ± 0.36.5 ± 0.314.9 ± 024.5 ± 1.1R5T/E13Y5.0 ± 0.28.7 ± 1.015.5 ± 0.372.6 ± 14.32.9 ± 0.212.6 ± 3.621.4 ± 1.8101 ± 13.6R14A24.0 ± 0.859.8 ± 2.8127>1284.7 ± 1.437.6 ± 4.7>128>128 Open table in a new tab R14A-HNP2 is by far the weakest defensin in the panel against both strains. Compared with those of wild type HNP2, the LD50, LD90, and LD99 values of R14A-HNP2 increased uniformly by 6-fold for E. coli, and by 2-, 3-, and at least 4-fold, respectively, for S. aureus. By contrast, the charge-reversing mutation E13R yielded the most potent defensin in the panel. E13R-HNP2 killed bacteria significantly more effectively than wild type HNP2, as evidenced by a roughly 3-fold decrease in vLD99.9. These results demonstrated the functional importance of cationic residues in defensins. Similarly, removal of a negative charge, i.e. E13Q, marginally enhanced the bactericidal activity of HNP2, showing a decrease in vLD99.9 by 2-fold against E. coli and in vLD99 by 3-fold against S. aureus. The two double mutants, R5T/E13Y and R5E/E13R, and wild type HNP2, in which the net positive charge remained unchanged, showed comparable bactericidal activity against E. coli. All four sets of vLD values of these three defensins varied within a factor of 2 for E. coli. For S. aureus, the difference widened in the high concentration range, where a consensus order of the relative bactericidal activity emerged as HNP2 > R5T/E13Y ∼ R5E/E13R. The bactericidal activity of defensins is attenuated by salt because of a weakened defensin-microbe interaction mediated largely by electrostatic forces. To investigate the effect of salt on the activity of HNP2 and its analogs, we carried out a functional assay at a fixed defensin concentration of 50 μg/ml in the presence of varying concentrations of NaCl, from 5 to 150 mm. As shown in Fig. 5, the bactericidal activity progressively decreased in a dose-dependent manner as the NaCl concentration increased. Furthermore, the survival of E. coli was noticeably more sensitive to the change in salt concentration than that of S. aureus. Two important conclusions can be drawn. First, the relative potency of the bactericidal activity of HNP2 and its analogs appeared independent of the salt concentration. A consensus order for both strains appeared to be: E13R (+5) > E13Q (+4) > HNP2 (+3) ∼ R5T/E13Y (+3) ∼ R5E/E13R (+3) > R14A (+2), which correlated with the number of net positive charges shown in parentheses. Second, as was the case with bactericidal activity, salt resistance of defensins was influenced less by whether or not the conserved Arg5-Glu13 salt bridge is decimated or weakened, but more by the number of net positive charges defensins carry. For example, in the case of S. aureus, the bactericidal activity of E13R-HNP2 was more salt-resistant than that of wild type HNP2. Taken together, these data suggest that the Arg5-Glu13 salt bridge in α-defensins is not conserved functionally. The Salt Bridge Is Important for the Resistance of Defensins to Proteolysis by Elastase—HNPs are stored in azurophils with several proteases including neutrophil elastase. To investigate whether the conserved salt bridge in α-defensins is important for proteolytic resistance, we incubated wild type HNP2 and the salt bridge analogs of HNP2 with elastase, and monitored the breakdown of the defensins on RP-HPLC. Shown in Fig. 6 are representative HPLC traces of HNP2, R5T/E13T-, and E13Q-HNP2 before and after incubation with elastase for 8 h, and time-dependent defensin degradation kinetics over a period of 24 h. Wild type HNP2 was markedly more resistant to proteolysis than any other defensin in the panel. Within 8 h of incubation, more than 70% of E13Q-HNP2 was hydrolyzed by the enzyme, whereas 80% of wild type HNP2 remained intact. Degradation of other salt bridge analogs was equally efficient as compared with that of E13Q-HNP2, except for R5T/E13T-HNP2,"
https://openalex.org/W1972377705,"Tumors comprise genetically heterogeneous cell populations, whose growth and survival depend on multiple signaling pathways. This has spurred the development of multitargeted therapies, including small molecules that can inhibit multiple kinases. A major challenge in designing such molecules is to determine which kinases to inhibit in each cancer to maximize efficacy and therapeutic index. We describe an approach to this problem implementing RNA interference technology. In order to identify Akt-cooperating kinases, we screened a library of kinase-directed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced cancer cell killing in the presence of Akt inhibitor A-443654. siRNAs targeting casein kinase I gamma 3 (CSNK1G3) or the inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) significantly enhanced A-443654-mediated cell killing, and caused decreases in Akt Ser-473 and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation. Small molecules targeting CSNK1G3 and/or IPMK in addition to Akt may thus exhibit increased efficacy and have the potential for improved therapeutic index."

https://openalex.org/W2020261641,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. EGFR downregulation attenuates its signaling intensity and duration to maintain cellular homeostasis. Here, we report that during apoptosis EGFR is cleaved by activated caspase-3 or related proteases at its C-terminus domain. EGFR downregulation by activation of caspases is neither stimulus- nor cell type-specific. EGFR internalization during apoptosis required dynamin and cholesterol since dominant-negative dynamin (K44A) or cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin prevented EGFR internalization. However, EGFR downregulation did not require its internalization. The EGFR cleavage fragment was detected in the membrane blebs in addition to the cell pellets. Mutations at the consensus sequence (DXXD) at the C-terminus domain revealed that DVVD1012 and to a lesser extent DNPD1172 may be target sites for active recombinant caspase-3 in vitro and activated caspase-3 or related proteases in vivo. We have detected the N-terminus and C-terminus fragments in vitro and in vivo. A cleavage-deficient EGFR mutant delayed apoptosis process. We conclude that the evolutionarily conserved C-terminus domain of EGFR is the target of caspases and subjected to degradation during apoptosis to shut down its signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2142321935,"The tumor suppressor protein, p53, plays a critical role in viro-oncology. However, the role of p53 in adenoviral replication is still poorly understood. In this paper, we have explored further the effect of p53 on adenoviral replicative lysis. Using well-characterized cells expressing a functional p53 (A549, K1neo, RKO) and isogenic derivatives that do not (K1scx, RKOp53.13), we show that virus replication, late virus protein expression and both wtAd5 and ONYX-015 virus-induced cell death are impaired in cells deficient in functional p53. Conversely, by transfecting p53 into these and other cells (IIICF/c, HeLa), we increase late virus protein expression and virus yield. We also show, using reporter assays in IIICF/c, HeLa and K1scx cells, that p53 can cooperate with E1a to enhance transcription from the major late promoter of the virus. Late viral protein production is enhanced by exogenous p53. Taken together, our data suggest that functional p53 can promote the adenovirus (Ad) lytic cycle. These results have implications for the use of Ad mutants that are defective in p53 degradation, such as ONYX-015, as agents for the treatment of cancers."

Here we show that the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 form a stable complex (Kd ∼ 6 μm) with their substrate the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Complex formation requires a domain of MITF of ∼100 residues that is nearby, but C-terminal to, the MAPK phosphorylation site at Ser73.

The MAPK (also known as extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, or ERK) cascade is a three-kinase module that transmits signals from cell-surface receptors to downstream targets through sequential phosphorylations (2Widmann C.

The MAPK is phosphorylated, and thereby activated, by an upstream MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which has previously been activated by a MEK kinase, such as the proto-oncoprotein Raf. To further propagate the signal, activated MAPKs phosphorylate other kinases such as RSK1 (3Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

In addition, dominant-negative mutations in MITF are associated with another auditory-pigmentary disorder, Teitz syndrome (13Amiel J. Watkin P.M. Tassabehji M. Read A.P. Winter R.M. Clin. Dysmorphol. 1998; 7: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Smith S.D. Kelley P.M. Kenyon J.B. Hoover D. J. Med.

MITF is also a potential target in the treatment of skin cancer, because it may impart a selective advantage to melanoma cells at low expression levels (16McGill G.G. Horstmann M. Widlund H.R. Du J. Motyckova G. Nishimura E.K. Lin Y.L. Ramaswamy S. Avery W. Ding H.F. Jordan S.A. Jackson I.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Golub T.R. Fisher D.E.

Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). During the differentiation of neural crest-derived melanocytes, activation of the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase by its ligand Steel factor initiates signaling through the Ras→Raf→MEK1/2→ERK1/2 cascade, resulting in the phosphorylation of MITF, and the consequent induction of genes involved in differentiation (e.g. p21Cip1 (19Carreira S. Goodall J. Aksan I. La Rocca S.A. Galibert M.D. Denat L. Larue L. Goding C.R. Nature. 2005; 433: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar)), melanogenesis (e.g. tyrosinase (20Yasumoto K. Yokoyama K. Shibata K. Tomita Y. Shibahara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8058-8070Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar)), and melanocyte survival (e.g. Bcl2 (16McGill G.G. Horstmann M. Widlund H.R. Du J. Motyckova G. Nishimura E.K. Lin Y.L. Ramaswamy S. Avery W. Ding H.F. Jordan S.A. Jackson I.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Golub T.R. Fisher D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar)). ERK2 directly phosphorylates MITF on Ser73 (21Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar); MITF is also phosphorylated at Ser409 by ERK-activated RSK1 (22Wu M. Hemesath T.J. Takemoto C.M. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G. Price E.R. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 301-312PubMed Google Scholar). The dually phosphorylated MITF displays increased affinity for the transcriptional co-activator CREB-binding protein (23Sato S. Roberts K. Gambino G. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Goding C.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Dually phosphorylated MITF is also targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, ensuring transient gene induction (22Wu M. Hemesath T.J. Takemoto C.M. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G. Price E.R. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 301-312PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of MAPKs to effectively and specifically recognize their substrates is enhanced by their capacity to bind to those substrates with relatively high affinity. Often, this interaction occurs via MAPK-docking sites on substrate proteins (24Enslen H. Davis R.J. Biol. Cell. 2001; 93: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These docking sites are small regions within substrates, removed from the site of phosphorylation, that bind with relatively high affinity to MAPKs, in some cases showing specificity for particular MAPKs. One class of MAPK-docking site, designated the “D-site,” has the consensus (K/R)1-3-X1-5-ϕXϕ, where ϕ is a hydrophobic residue, typically Leu, Ile, Val, or Met. D-sites (also called “D-domains,” “DEJL motifs,” or “kinase interaction motifs”) were first identified in the in the yeast MEK Ste7 and the transcription factors c-Jun and Elk-1 (26Bardwell L.

Recent structural and mutagenesis studies indicate that the basic submotif of the D-site contacts two closely spaced acidic patches on the MAPK surface, the “CD/sevenmaker” region (30Heo Y.S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), whereas the hydrophobic submotif of the D-site binds to a nearby “hydrophobic docking groove” (30Heo Y.S. Kim S.K. Seo C.I. Kim Y.K. Sung B.J. Lee H.S. Lee J.I. Park S.Y. Kim J.H. Hwang K.Y. Hyun Y.L. Jeon Y.H. Ro S. Cho J.M. Lee T.G. Yang C.H.

Cell. 2004; 14: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A second docking motif, related to the D-site, is found in MAPK-activated kinases such as RSK1 (36Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This motif (consensus L-X1-2-(R/K)2-5) also makes contacts with the CD/sevenmaker and ED regions (32Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 33Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Another docking motif for MAPKs (consensus FXFP) has been named the “DEF motif” (37Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 38Fantz D.A. Jacobs D. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27256-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This motif binds to a hydrophobic pocket (distinct from the one that the D-site binds to) that is located below the MAPK active site. This pocket is occluded in unphosphorylated ERK2 (35Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Kabuyama Y. Stroud J. Min X. Goldsmith E.J. Chen L. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); thus, the DEF motif preferentially binds to the dually phosphorylated, activated isoform of ERK2 (35Lee T.

Protein kinases are important therapeutic targets (39Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Science. 2004; 303: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, 40Herrera R. Sebolt-Leopold J.S.

Most existing kinase inhibitors bind to the active site, and thus inhibit the ability of a kinase to phosphorylate all of its substrates. The concept of kinase-substrate docking raises new possibilities for drug discovery (43Bogoyevitch M.A. Boehm I. Oakley A. Ketterman A.J. Barr R.K. Biochim. Biophys.

First, molecules that target docking interactions can also be effective inhibitors, as exemplified by the ability of D-site peptides to inhibit MAPK-dependent reactions in vitro (47Ho D.T.

Second, if MAPKs and other protein kinases use different parts of their surfaces to dock to different substrates, then it might be possible to selectively inhibit a subset of interactions, while leaving others relatively unimpaired. This could be advantageous in limiting toxicity and other side effects. Here we report our characterization of an interaction between ERK1 and ERK2 and their substrate MITF and demonstrate that D-site peptides are selective for the inhibition of D-site-containing substrates, and do not effectively inhibit ERK2 phosphorylation of MITF in vitro. Plasmids for in Vitro Transcription/Translation—The following mammalian genes were used in this study: human MITF (transcript variant 4, GenBank™/EBI accession number NM_000248), human MEK1 (MAP2K1, accession number NM_002755), MEK2 (MAP2K2, NM_030662), MKK6 (MAP2K6, NM_002758), and p38α (MAPK14, L35253), and rat ERK2 (M64300).

To construct pGEM4Z-MITF, the MITF coding region was amplified by high fidelity PCR using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase, primers Mi 1-X (5′-GCGAATTCACCATGCTGGAAATGCTAGAATA) and Mi X-419 (GCGGTCGACCTAACAAGTGTGCTCCGTCT), and a cDNA clone (National Institutes of Health, Image, ID no. 268834) obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium (55Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) as the template. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEM4Z (Promega). To construct many truncation mutants of pGEM4Z-MITF, the MITF coding region was amplified using appropriate primers and pGEM4Z-MITF as the template. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and SalI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEM4Z. Generation of pGEM4Z-MITFΔ98-190, pGEM4Z-ERK2-7m1, and pGEM4Z-ERK2-7m2 was accomplished by site directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids for the Production of GST Fusion Proteins—The vector used for generating the GST fusion proteins was pGEXLB (48Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a derivative of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of pGEX-ERK1, pGEXLB-ERK2, pGEXLB-MEK2-(1-64), and pGEX-STE7-(1-198) has been described previously (27Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To construct pGEXLB-MITF-(35-198) and pGEXLB-MITF-(35-98), the coding regions were excised from pGEM4Z-MITF-(35-198) and pGEM4Z-MITF-(35-98), respectively, by digestion with EcoRI and SalI, and inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEXLB. Plasmids for Transfection into Mammalian Cell Lines—To construct pcDNA-MITF-V5, the full-length MITF coding sequence was amplified by high fidelity PCR (using the cDNA Image clone as template), digested with EcoRI and ApaI and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pcDNA3.1-V5 vector (Invitrogen). Similarly, pcDNA-MITF-(98-198)-V5 was constructed by amplifying the appropriate region of MITF, and ligating the resulting PCR product into the EcoRI and ApaI sites of pcDNA3.1-V5. Plasmid pcDNA-MITF-ΔEBD-V5 (Δ98-190) was constructed by site directed mutagenesis of pcDNA3.1-V5-MITF using primers that consisted of the DNA sequence of the regions that flank the DNA resulting in residues 98-190. The construction of pcDNA3.1-FLAG-ERK2 has been described previously (56Grewal S. Molina D.M. Bardwell L. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Binding Assays—In vitro transcription and translation were performed using a coupled reaction (SP3, Novagen). The translation products were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation as described previously (48Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified, and quantified as previously described (48Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol.

Protein Kinase Assays—The protein kinase assays for ERK2 phosphorylation of Elk-1 was performed as described previously (49Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Kinase reactions (20 μl) for ERK2 phosphorylation of MITF contained kinase-assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol), 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ32-P]ATP, 1 μm MITF (a fusion protein consisting of residues 35-198 or 35-98), and 10 units (∼1 ng) of active mouse ERK2 (New England Biolabs). Reactions were performed for 20 min at 30 °C. MITF phosphorylation was quantified by SDS-PAGE followed by analysis of relative incorporation using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins and Antisera—GST-Elk-1-(307-428) and active mouse ERK2 were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. The anti-ERK antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was obtained from Invitrogen. AlexaFluor-488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Co-sedimentation of ERK from HEK293 Cell Lysates—HEK293 cells (obtained from ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. Cells (5 × 105 per well) were seeded into 6-well dishes and grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 2 mm l-glutamine. Twenty hours prior to harvesting, cells were transferred to media containing 0.5% serum. For epidermal growth factor stimulations, cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 5 min prior to harvesting. Cells were then scraped into 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma) (58Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min to remove any insoluble material, and the resultant supernatants were pre-cleared with 20 μl of blocked 50% reduced glutathione beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then incubated with the specified amounts of bead-bound GST fusion protein at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were then washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold cell wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-total-MAPK or anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies (Cell Signaling). Blots were then incubated with AlexaFluor-680/800 nm secondary antibody conjugates (Molecular Probes) and were analyzed using the Odyssey Infra-Red Imaging System and software (LI-COR BioSciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells (5 × 105) were seeded into 6-well culture dishes and were co-transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA encoding either V5-tagged full-length MITF (pcDNA3.1-V5-MITF), MITF-ΔEBD (pcDNA3.1-V5-MITF-ΔEBD), MITF-EBD (pcDNA3.1-V5-MITF-EBD), or empty vector (pcDNA3.1-V5), and 1 μg of plasmid encoding ERK2 (pcDNA3.1-FLAG-ERK2) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours post-transfection cells from two 35-mm wells were lysed into 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm NaVO4, 50 mm glycero-phosphate, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), pH 7.6) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant lysates were then cleared with 20 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were then incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 20 μl of beads (50% slurry) that had been preincubated with 1 μl of anti-V5 antibody (30 min at 4 °C). The beads were washed twice with 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 m NaCl, once with 0.5 ml of 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2 and were finally resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated on standard SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Primary antibody incubations were carried out overnight at room temperature, followed by 1-h incubations with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL detection kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The protocol for immunostaining has been described previously (56Grewal S. Molina D.M. Bardwell L. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MITF Binds ERK2 Specifically and with High Affinity—To assess the nature of the interaction between human ERK2 and its target transcription factor MITF, rat ERK2 was fused at its N terminus to Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST), and the resulting fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and purified by adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose beads. ERK2 prepared in this manner is obtained in its unphosphorylated, unactivated state. GST-ERK2 (or GST alone as a negative control) was then incubated with full-length human MITF that had been produced in radiolabeled form by in vitro translation (Fig. 1). As a positive control, GST-ERK2 beads were incubated with radiolabeled human MEK2; we have previously shown that ERK2-MEK2 binding can be detected using this assay (48Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10374-10386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Bead-bound complexes were collected by sedimentation, washed extensively, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1, full-length MITF bound efficiently to ERK2 (Kd ∼ 6 μm, see TABLE ONE); this binding was specific, because precipitation of MITF protein did not occur when GST was used instead of the GST-ERK2 fusion protein. MEK2 also bound specifically to GST-ERK2, as previously reported (48Bardwell A.J. Flatauer L.J. Matsukuma K. Thorner J. Bardwell L. J. Biol.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation and siRNAs revealed that expression of ELA2 is regulated by the acute myeloid human leukemia 1 protein (AML1), C/EBPα, PU.1 and c-Myb transcription factors. ELA2 has also been investigated as a possible target of the leukemic fusion protein AML1-ETO resulting from the t(8;21) chromosomal translocation. AML1-ETO, like AML1, binds the ELA2 promoter in the myeloid cell lines Kasumi-1 and U937, but unexpectedly fails to significantly alter expression of ELA2. Although AML1-ETO downregulates the expression of C/EBPα, changes in C/EBPα expression do not correlate with changes in the expression of ELA2. Our observations indicate that AML1-ETO may not be a constitutive repressor of gene expression in every case in which it can associate with DNA, either on its own or in conjunction with C/EBPα. Since neither ETO nor AML1-ETO are typically expressed in hematopoietic progenitors, we hypothesize that it is the interactions between AML1-ETO and regulatory cofactors in disease-state cells that alter gene expression programs during hematopoiesis. These protein–protein interactions may not require simultaneous DNA binding by AML1-ETO for the deleterious effects of the fusion protein to be realized."

https://openalex.org/W1982662712,"The Nf2 tumor suppressor codes for merlin, a protein whose function is largely unknown. We have previously demonstrated a novel interaction between merlin and TRBP, which inhibits the oncogenic activity of TRBP. In spite of the significance of their functional interaction, its molecular mechanism still remains to be elucidated. In this report, we investigated how merlin inhibits the oncogenic activity of TRBP in association with cell growth conditions. In the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line, the level of endogenous merlin increased, whereas that of endogenous TRBP significantly decreased along with the increase in cell confluence. We demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal region of TRBP was responsible for this phenomenon using stable cell lines expressing deletion mutants of TRBP. The overexpression of merlin decreased the protein level of TRBP, and the ubiquitin-like subdomain of merlin's FERM domain was important for this activity. We also demonstrated that TRBP is ubiquitinylated and the ubiquitinylated forms of TRBP are accumulated by ectopically expressed merlin or cell confluence in the presence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Furthermore, we showed that the regulation of TRBP in response to cell confluence was abolished upon knockdown of merlin expression by specific small interfering RNA. Finally, we showed that ectopically expressed merlin restored cell-cell contact inhibition in cells stably expressing TRBP but not in TRBPDeltac. These results suggest that merlin is involved in the regulation of TRBP protein level by facilitating its ubiquitination in response to such cues as cell-cell contacts."

Although very similar, the signature domains of thrombospondin-1 and -2 differ in several potentially important ways from the domains of thrombospondin-3, -4, and -5. We have compared matching recombinant segments representing the signature domains of thrombospondin-2 and -4. In the presence of 2 mm CaCl2, the far UV circular dichroism spectra of thrombospondin-2 and -4 constructs contain a strong negative band at 202 nm, but only the thrombospondin-2 construct has a band at 216 nm. Chelation of calcium shifted the negative bands to lower magnitudes. Titrations of the spectra demonstrated lower cooperativity and affinity for binding of calcium to thrombospondin-4 compared with thrombospondin-2. Atomic absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the thrombospondin-4 constructs bind seven less calcium than the thrombospondin-2 construct at 0.6 mm CaCl2. In 2 mm CaCl2, the near UV circular dichroism spectra of thrombospondin-2, but not thrombospondin-4, contain a positive band at 292 nm that disappears upon calcium chelation. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra for both proteins were also sensitive to calcium, but the changes were simpler and more marked for thrombospondin-2 than for thrombospondin-4. In differential scanning calorimetry, the thrombospondin-2 construct melted in two distinct transitions at 53.5 and 81.8 °C, whereas the first transition for thrombospondin-4 constructs was observed at 63.5 °C. Thus, the studies revealed significant differences between the signature domains of thrombospondin-2 and thrombospondin-4 in calcium binding, fine structure, and inter-modular interactions.

Biol. 2003; 328: 479-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TSPs are modular multimeric proteins that can be divided into two groups, subgroup A comprising TSP-1 and TSP-2 and subgroup B comprising TSP-3, -4, and -5. TSP-1 and -2 in subgroup A are homotrimeric proteins composed of three identical 150-kDa monomers connected by disulfide bridges. Each monomer contains an N-terminal module (N), an oligomerization domain (O), a procollagen module (C), three properdin modules (P123), three epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules (E123), calcium-binding repeats, and a C-terminal globe (G) (Fig. 1). Subgroup B TSPs form pentamers, do not contain C or P modules, and have one extra E module (E2′) (Fig. 1). The “signature domain” of a TSP, therefore, is its C-terminal portion composed of the E, calcium-binding repeats, and G modules. The calcium-binding repeats and G modules have been highly conserved among all TSPs (1Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Lawler J. The Thrombospondin Gene Family. 1995; Google Scholar, 2Adams J.C. Monk R.

The signature domain is cysteine-rich with six cysteines/EGF-like module, 17 cysteines in the calcium-binding repeats, and one (TSP-2) or two (TSP-1, -3, -4, and -5) cysteines in G. The cysteines of the EGF-like modules of TSP-2 form disulfides in a typical 1–3, 2–4, 5–6 pattern (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The disulfide connectivity of the 18 absolutely conserved cysteines in CaG-2 of TSP-2 is sequential, thereby separating the structure into 13 calcium-binding motifs (5Misenheimer T.M. Hahr A.J.

Crystallographic analyses of the six most C-terminal calcium-binding repeats and G of TSP-1 and the entire signature domain of TSP-2 reveal a novel structure in which the polypeptide chain of the 13 calcium-binding repeats is organized around a core of 26 calcium ions forming a “wire” module (4Carlson C.B.

Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, E2 binds one calcium ion, and the lectin-like β-sandwich of the G module binds four (TSP-1) or three (TSP-2) calcium ions. The TSP-2 structure shows that the wire interacts at its two ends with the third EGF-like module and the lectin-like G module. This structure agrees with biophysical data of an E3CaG-2 construct from TSP-2 that indicate that the calcium-binding repeats are well structured by themselves but interact with E3 and G to form a complex structural unit (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TSP-4 is expressed by muscle interstitial cells and neurons, promotes neurite outgrowth, and accumulates at the neuromuscular junction (8Arber S. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). High levels of TSP-4 mRNA have been detected in heart and skeletal muscles (9Lawler J. Duquette M. Whittaker C.A. Adams J.C. McHenry K. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and human endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells from brain blood vessels and coronary arteries have been shown to express TSP-4 mRNA (10Stenina O.I.

The signature domain of TSP-4 binds to collagens I, II, III, and V as well as laminin-1, fibronectin, and matrilin-2 (11Narouz-Ott L. Maurer P. Nitsche D.P. Smyth N. Paulsson M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 24: e183-e184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the TSP-4 sequence to the TSP-2 sequence reveals several differences that are striking considering the overall high identity (Fig. 2). Compared with TSP-2, TSP-4 has an extra EGF-like module (E2′) that has a calcium-binding site and the unusual cysteine spacing pattern present in E2 of TSP-2 (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S.

In addition, calcium-binding repeat 1C is three residues shorter in TSP-4 and lacks an N glycosylation site, calcium-binding repeat 11C in TSP-4 has a four-residue insertion, TSP-4 has an unpaired cysteine in G, and TSP-4 has an extra 18 residues added to its C terminus. To test the hypothesis that these differences result in structural differences between the signature domains of TSP-2 and -4, we have analyzed recombinant E123CaG-2 and E122′3CaG-4 using intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), atomic absorption spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As part of these comparisons, we tested TSP-4 constructs that harbored either the Ala387 or Pro387 allele in the E2′ module. Cloning of E122′3CaG-4 Ala387 and E122′3CaG-4 Pro387—The pAcGP67.coco baculovirus transfer vector, which contains DNA encoding a signal peptide 5′ to and a six-histidine tag (His tag) 3′ to the cloning site, was used to facilitate baculovirus-mediated protein expression (18Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). E122′3CaG-4 Ala387 (residues 286–961) was PCR-amplified from a full-length clone of human TSP-4 (a generous donation of Drs. Jack Lawler, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and Faye Hui Chen, Columbia University, New York, NY), and inserted into pAcGP67.coco. The TSP-4 clone has a Val at position 737 (as indicated in Swiss-Prot entry P35443) instead of the Gly737 originally published for human TSP-4 (19Lawler J. McHenry K. Duquette M. Derick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2809-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Swiss-Prot describes rat, mouse, and Xenopus TSP-4 as having Val at the equivalent position. The Pro387 polymorphism was introduced by PCR mutagenesis into E122′3CaG-4. Correct orientation and sequence of PCR-amplified DNA were verified by automated sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The proteins were expressed by infecting High Five insect cells in SF900II serum-free medium at 22 °C with high titer virus (>108 plaque-forming units/ml) at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Conditioned medium was collected ∼65 h post-infection. Histidine-tagged proteins were purified from the medium in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as described previously (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S.

Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using absorbance at 280 nm and calculated extinction coefficients of 1.07 and 1.24 ml mg-1 cm-1 for E122′3CaG-4 and E123CaG-2, respectively (20Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Calcium Binding—The ability of purified proteins to bind Ca2+ was measured directly using atomic absorption spectroscopy (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Atomic absorption quantification of calcium content was done at the University of Wisconsin Chemistry Department using a Solaar Unicam 969 flame atomic absorption spectrometer. Prior to analysis, the proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm MOPS, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5 containing 0.6 mm CaCl2. Protein solution and dialysis buffer were analyzed for calcium using calcium carbonate as the standard. Atomic absorption values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of 3–4 experiments. Circular Dichroism—CD studies were done at the University of Wisconsin Biophysics Instrumentation Facility using an Aviv 62A DS CD spectrometer. Far UV light measurements were taken at 37 °C in a 0.1-cm path length cuvette using protein (0.08–0.10 mg/ml) dialyzed into 5 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. Calcium titrations were analyzed as described previously (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) by comparing the fractional change (R) in mean residue ellipticity at 210 nm at given calcium concentrations divided by the difference in values observed when no further changes occur upon the addition of EDTA. The Hill equation that describes this plot is log(R/1 - R) = nlog[Ca2+] + log K, where n is the Hill coefficient and K is an equilibrium dissociation constant (21Lawler J. Simons E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12098-12101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Near UV light measurements were taken at 25 °C in a 1 cm path length cuvette using protein (0.8–1.2 mg/ml) dialyzed into 10 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—DSC was done at the University of Wisconsin Biophysics Instrumentation Facility using a Microcal differential scanning calorimeter with proteins (0.8–1.5 mg/ml) dialyzed into 10 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. Scans were from 15 to 95 °C at a rate of 60 °/h. Intrinsic Fluorescence—Fluorescence emission spectra of purified proteins (0.04–0.05 mg/ml) in 5 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5 were obtained at 37 °C using a JY Fluoromax-3 fluorometer with excitation at 295 nm. Fluorescence spectra were obtained for each protein after each addition of EDTA. Calcium titrations were analyzed by calculating the relative fluorescence intensities at 332 nm at each calcium concentration (fluorescence intensity at a given calcium concentration divided by the fluorescence intensity at 2 mm CaCl2). Fluorescence was also monitored during thermal denaturation and upon denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride. Proteins were dialyzed into 5 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5 prior to denaturation. For comparisons of the TSP-4 signature domain to the E123CaG-2 signature domain of TSP-2, for which there is a crystal structure (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we expressed E122′3CaG-4 containing either Ala or Pro at position 387 in E2′ (Fig. 1). When the sequences of TSP-2 and -4 are aligned, it is apparent that E2 of TSP-4 is most like E2 of TSP-2, and the extra EGF-like module (E2′), although most like E2, is the EGF-like module that is present in TSP-4 and missing in TSP-2 (Fig. 2). The proteins were cloned and expressed using a baculovirus expression system and purified using nickel chelate chromatography (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The yields of purified TSP-4 proteins were 10–40 mg/liter conditioned medium. This level of expression is comparable with the expression of the TSP-2 proteins (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and much higher than the secretion of intact TSP-1 or -2 under the same conditions (data not shown). All truncated proteins were soluble and amenable to structural and functional analyses. Far UV Circular Dichroism—In the presence of calcium, both E122′3CaG-4 constructs and E123CaG-2 have a negative band at 202 nm (Fig. 3). The E122′3CaG-4 spectra, however, lack a negative band at 216 nm that is apparent in E123CaG-2 (Fig. 3A), as well as full-length TSP-1 (21Lawler J. Simons E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12098-12101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and E3CaG-2 (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Calcium chelation shifts the spectra of all three proteins to lower magnitudes (Fig. 3B), as was observed for TSP-1 (21Lawler J. Simons E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12098-12101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and E3CaG-2 (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Calcium sensitivity of the proteins was monitored by measuring the change in ellipticity at 210 nm upon the addition of increasing amounts of EDTA (Fig. 4). The titration curves reveal that E122′3CaG-4 Ala387 and Pro387 gradually transition with EC50 values of 660 and 580 μm calcium and Hill coefficients of 3 and 2. E123CaG-2, in contrast, has an EC50 value of 410 μm calcium and a steep titration curve with a Hill coefficient of 7, indicating a more cooperative process than for the TSP-4 constructs.FIGURE 4Far UV CD titration curves. Far UV CD spectra for E123CaG-2 (open circles), E122′3CaG-4 Ala387 (closed triangles), and E122′3CaG-4 Pro387 (open triangles) were measured at 37 °C in 5 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 0–2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. Protein, initially in 2 mm CaCl2, was treated with increasing amounts of EDTA to remove CaCl2. Results were analyzed by comparing the fractional change in molar ellipticity at 210 nm at a given calcium concentration divided by the difference in values observed when no further changes occur upon the addition of EDTA (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Calcium Binding—Calcium binding of the constructs in buffer containing 0.6 mm CaCl2 was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Because the analysis requires subtraction of the calcium content in dialysis buffer from the calcium content of the protein solution, this was the highest calcium concentration at which there was enough enrichment in the protein solutions to obtain an accurate measurement. E123CaG-2 bound 28 ± 1 Ca2+/protein. This result is consistent with what we reported previously for E3CaG-2 (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and in agreement with the 30 bound calcium ions found in the crystal structure of E123CaG-2 (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The TSP-4 constructs bound seven less calcium ions than the TSP-2 construct, 21 ± 2 Ca2+/protein for E122′3CaG-4 Ala387 and 20 ± 1 Ca2+/protein for E122′3CaG-4 Pro387. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Thermal stability of the proteins was measured using DSC. In 2 mm CaCl2, E123CaG-2 melted with two transitions (53.5 and 81.8 °C) (Fig. 5), similar to the reported transitions for E3CaG-2 (50.5 and 82.7 °C) (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Under identical conditions, we were only able to measure one transition for E122′3CaG-4 Ala387 and Pro387 at 63.3 and 63.5 °C, respectively (Fig. 5). We do not know whether a higher transition is present, because both E122′3CaG-4 constructs precipitated between 75 and 80 °C, and the experiments had to be discontinued. Near UV Circular Dichroism—The near UV CD spectra of E122′3CaG-4 Ala387 and Pro387 are similar to each other but different from E123CaG-2 (Fig. 6). In the presence of calcium, E123CaG-2 has a peak at 292 nm that can be attributed to the tryptophan residues, whereas the E122′3CaG-4 proteins do not have this peak. Upon chelation of calcium, the 292-nm peak disappears. This calcium-sensitive peak was previously observed in E3CaG-2 and CaG-2 but not E3Ca-2 and Ca-2, so it is believed to be due to one or several of the tryptophan residues in G (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both E123CaG-2 and E122′3CaG-4 contain nine tryptophans, seven of which are conserved and located in G (Fig. 2). A tryptophan is also present in the first calcium-binding repeat of E123CaG-2 but not of E122′3CaG-4. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues is sensitive to perturbations in the local protein structure. The intrinsic fluorescence of the seven conserved tryptophans has been shown to be calcium-sensitive and to dominate the fluorescence spectra of E3CaG-2 (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because G has been found to bind three calcium ions in TSP-2 (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and 4 calcium ions in TSP-1 (6Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and to interact intimately with the calcium binding repeats of thrombospondin and E3, the tryptophan fluorescence could be influenced by removal of calcium from G or disruption of interactions of G with the calcium binding repeats of thrombospondin and the EGF-like repeats. The local tryptophan environment was examined by measuring intrinsic fluorescence after excitation at 295 nm (Fig. 7). The fluorescence emission spectra for all three proteins are sensitive to the presence of calcium. In the presence of calcium, the wavelength of maximum fluorescence (λmax) is about 332 nm for the three proteins, but the shift in λmax upon removal of calcium is more for E123CaG-2 than for E122′3CaG-4 Ala387 or E122′3CaG-4 Pro387. The λmax for E123CaG-2 increased 4.5 nm from 332.5 nm at 2 mm Ca2+ to 337 nm at 0 mm Ca2+, whereas the λmax for the E122′3CaG-4 proteins only increased 1.5 nm from 332 to 333.5 nm (TABLE ONE). Calcium sensitivity of the intrinsic fluorescence was examined in more detail by titration of calcium-replete E122′3CaG-4 Ala387, E122′3CaG-4 Pro387, and E123CaG-2 with increasing amounts of EDTA (Fig. 8). The fluorescence intensity of E122′3CaG-4 Ala or Pro387 initially decreased gradually as calcium was removed and then jumped back to the starting intensity with an EC50 value of 560 μm for the second transition. The fluorescence intensity of E123CaG-2, however, continually decreased as calcium was removed, with a resulting EC50 value of 980 μm calcium.TABLE ONEWavelength of maximum fluorescence Intrinsic fluorescence was monitored for E123CaG-2, E122′3CaG-4 Ala387, and E122′3CaG-4 Pro387 under various conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” The wavelength of maximum fluorescence is presented for each condition.Protein2 mm Ca2+ 37°C0 mm Ca2+ 37°C2 mm Ca2+ 70°C5 m GuHCl 2 mm Ca2+ 37°CnmnmnmnmE123CaG-2332.5337339348E122′3CaG-4 Ala387332333.5339348E122′3CaG-4 Pro387331.5333.5338348 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 8Titration of intrinsic fluorescence. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra of E123CaG-2 (open circles), E122′3CaG-4 Ala387 (closed triangles), and E122′3CaG-4 Pro387 (open triangles) were measured at 37 °C in 5 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 0–2 mm CaCl2, pH7.5, after excitation at 295 nm. Titration curves were made by the addition of increasing amounts of EDTA. Results at different calcium concentrations are compared by calculating the fluorescence intensity relative to that observed at 2 mm CaCl2 (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An increase in λmax indicates the local area around the tryptophan residues unfolds, resulting in an increased exposure of the tryptophan residues to water. Intrinsic fluorescence was also monitored during thermal denaturation and titration with guanidine hydrochloride. In all cases, the degree of unfolding observed, as measured by change in λmax, was less upon removal of calcium by EDTA than upon thermal denaturation or denaturation with 5 m guanidine hydrochloride (TABLE ONE). The λmax for all three proteins at 37 °C in 2 mm CaCl2 was ∼332 nm and shifted to 338–339 nm upon heating to 70 °C or to 348 nm upon the addition of 5 m guanidine hydrochloride, suggesting that calcium depletion does not denature either protein, but rather, shifts the proteins to new folded states. Comparison of the TSP-4 E122′3CaG-4 constructs to the analogous TSP-2 construct E123CaG-2 using CD, fluorescence, atomic absorption, and calorimetry reveal significant differences in structure and calcium-binding properties between the signature domains of the two TSPs. Because the signature domain of TSP-4 is most similar to that of TSP-3 and next most similar to TSP-5 (3Adams J.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1102-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the analyses of TSP-4 structure are pertinent to understanding all three of the pentameric TSPs. Atomic absorption spectroscopy showed that, in 0.6 mm CaCl2, E122′3CaG-4 binds seven less calcium ions than E123CaG-2. The 28 ± 1 calcium ions bound to E123CaG-2 using atomic absorption spectroscopy agrees with the crystal structure of E123CaG-2. The far UV CD titration data indicate that the structural change in E123CaG-2 upon calcium binding is complete by 0.5 mm CaCl2, but only 40–50% complete for E122′3CaG-4 (Fig. 4). Therefore, complete binding would not be expected for the TSP-4 constructs at 0.6 mm CaCl2, in which case E122′3CaG-4 may lack fewer than 7 calcium-binding sites when fully saturated. Asp744 and Asn746 of repeat 3C of TSP-2 are replaced with Ala and Gly, respectively, in TSP-4 (Fig. 2). The crystal structure of E123CaG-2 shows that the side chains of Asp744 and Asn746 help coordinate two calcium ions (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Loss of at least two calcium-binding sites in TSP-4 is, therefore, predicted. These sites are also likely lacking in TSP-3 and -5. The presence of four extra residues in repeat 11C of E122′3CaG-4 may hinder the repeat from adopting its distinctive calcium-binding fold and further compromise calcium binding to TSP-4 (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because TSP-3 also contains this insertion (3Adams J.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1102-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), its folding would be predicted to be similarly affected. Numerous studies indicate that alterations in one calcium-binding repeat change the kinetics of binding to adjacent repeats. The N700S polymorphism in calcium-binding repeat 1C of TSP-1, which results in the loss of a single calcium-binding site, is associated with lower affinity binding and decreased rate of binding to the next three calcium-binding repeats (22Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Pranghofer M.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51915-51922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In TSP-5, single missense mutations in the calcium-binding repeats associated with pseudoachondroplasia or multiple epiphyseal dysplasia have been found to result in a reduction in the amount of calcium bound, the affinity of binding, and the cooperativity of binding (23Chen H. Deere M. Hecht J.T. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26538-26544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Maddox B.K. Mokashi A. Keene D.R. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11412-11417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It seems reasonable to hypothesize, therefore, that the loss of two binding sites in repeat 3C and the possible altered conformation of repeat 11C lead to the observed decreases in affinity and cooperativity of TSP-4. Intrinsic fluorescence, near UV CD, and far UV CD data suggest that the structure of G differs in TSP-2 and TSP-4. The far UV CD spectra of both E122′3CaG-4 and E123CaG-2 have a negative band at 202 nm, but only E123CaG-2 has a negative band at 216 nm (Fig. 3). This negative band at 216 nm in TSP-2 can be attributed to G inasmuch as it is present in C-terminal TSP-2 constructs containing G but absent in constructs lacking G (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The near UV CD spectra of TSP-4 are lacking a positive band at 292 nm (Fig. 6), which has been shown to be attributable to the tryptophan residues in G of TSP-2 (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CD bands in the near UV spectra are observed when aromatic residues are immobilized in an asymmetric environment (26Creighton T.E. Protein Structure, A Practical Approach, 2nd Ed. 1997; : 287-296Google Scholar). The lack of a peak at 292 nm indicates that the tryptophan residues are either not immobilized in an asymmetric environment or are immobilized in different orientations, and the resulting CD bands cancel each other out. Such differences in tryptophan, in addition to differences in secondary structure, may contribute to changes in far UV CD spectra as well (26Creighton T.E. Protein Structure, A Practical Approach, 2nd Ed. 1997; : 287-296Google Scholar). Differences in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the TSP-4 and -2 proteins (Figs. 7 and 8) are also primarily due to changes in the environment of the conserved tryptophans of G (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the calcium-replete fluorescence spectra are similar, with a λmax value of ∼332 nm (Fig. 7), removal of calcium red shifts the λmax value of 4.5 nm for E123CaG-2 and only 1.5 nm for E122′3CaG-4 (TABLE ONE), and calcium titration curves monitored using fluorescence have two transitions for TSP-4 and only one for TSP-2 (Fig. 8). DSC revealed differences in the thermal stability of the TSP-4 and -2 proteins. E123CaG-2 melts with transitions at 53.5° and 81.8 °C (Fig. 5). Previously, we found that E3CaG-2 melts with transitions at 50.5° and 82.7 °C (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The first transition was assigned to unfolding of the inter-modular interface among E3, the calcium-binding repeats, and G, whereas the second transition was assigned to the unfolding of the calcium-binding repeats (7Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The increase in the first transition, when E12 is added to E3CaG-2, is compatible with the observed interaction between the C-terminal part of the calcium-binding repeats and E2 in the crystal structure of E123CaG-2 (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Only one transition at 63.5 °C was observed for the TSP-4 proteins before they precipitated (Fig. 5). Because the proteins precipitated between 75° and 80 °C, it is unknown whether another transition would have occurred if the experiment could have been completed. In other words, the 63.5° transition may be the only transition, thereby corresponding to both the unfolding of the calcium-binding repeats and the unfolding of the intermodular interface, or it may be the first transition corresponding to the unfolding of the interface only. Either way, a difference in stability is apparent between the E122′3CaG-4 constructs and the homologous E123CaG-2 construct. Without a crystal structure for TSP-4, however, the exact nature of the difference is unknown. Because of the putative role of the A387P TSP-4 polymorphism in premature myocardial infarction (14Topol E.J. McCarthy J. Gabriel S. Moliterno D.J. Rogers W.J. Newby L.K. Freedman M. Metivier J.

Biol. 2004; 24: e183-e184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we expressed the C-terminal region of hTSP-4 as both the common (Ala387) and polymorphic (Pro387) forms. High levels of TSP-4 mRNA have been detected in heart and skeletal muscles (9Lawler J. Duquette M. Whittaker C.A. Adams J.C. McHenry K. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and human endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells from brain blood vessels and coronary arteries have been shown to express TSP-4 mRNA (10Stenina O.I. Desai S.Y. Krukovets I. Kight K. Janigro D. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1514-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A recombinant E122′3Ca piece of TSP-4 with the Pro387 allele suppresses endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation, suggesting that it is a “gain of function” polymorphism that is proatherogenic (10Stenina O.I. Desai S.Y. Krukovets I. Kight K. Janigro D. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1514-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, an E122′3 Pro387 construct has been reported to have an additional Tb3+-binding site (27Stenina O.I. Ustinov V. Krukovets I. Marinic T. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1893-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, our analyses failed to reveal significant structural differences in E122′3CaG-4 due to the polymorphism. Atomic absorption spectroscopy indicated that both TSP-4 proteins bind the same number of calcium ions. Far UV CD, near UV CD, and intrinsic fluorescence spectra for E122′3CaG-4 Ala387 and Pro387 are virtually identical (Figs. 3, 4, 6, and 7), and DSC showed similar thermal stabilities (Fig. 5). Therefore, the A387P single nucleotide polymorphism does not appear to affect the overall protein structure of E122′3CaG-4 nor does it alter its calcium-binding properties. The polymorphic TSP-4 contains a Pro instead of an Ala at position 387 in the third EGF-like module (E2′) of TSP-4 (Fig. 2). Comparative NMR analysis of a proline to alanine (P1148A) missense mutation in calcium binding EGF13 of fibrillin-1 has revealed that the fibrillin mutation also does not result in a structural defect in EGF13 or the adjacent EGFs (28Whiteman P. Downing A.K. Handford P.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 957-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similar to Pro1148 of fibrillin-1, Pro387 of TSP-4 is in a calcium-binding EGF and is expected to be in a turn (not a β-sheet) (4Carlson C.B. Bernstein D.A. Annis D.S. Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Mosher D.F. Keck J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The striking differences in the effects of the constructs based on common and polymorphic TSP-4 on the phenotype of endothelial cells (10Stenina O.I. Desai S.Y. Krukovets I. Kight K. Janigro D. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1514-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) is, therefore, likely due to an altered interaction with some cellular component caused by a local structural change in the third EGF rather than by an overall structural change. Together, the calcium binding, spectroscopic, and calorimetric data reveal significant structural differences in the C-terminal regions of TSP-2 and -4, especially in the lectin-like G domain. Further analysis of TSP-4 is necessary to determine which structural differences account for the altered calcium-binding properties. It may not be any single difference but rather a combination of differences that leads to fewer calcium-binding sites in TSP-4, a decrease in cooperativity of binding, and differences in fluorescence and CD spectra.

https://openalex.org/W1986420518,"A second generation genetically-engineered cell-based drug delivery system, referred to as apoptotic-induced drug delivery (AIDD), was developed using endothelial cells (ECs) that undergo apoptosis upon binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to a Flk-1:Fas fusion protein (FF). This new AIDD was redesigned using mouse brain derived ECs, bEnd3 cells, and an adenovirus vector in order to enhance and control the expression of FF. The FF was tagged with a HA epitope (FFHA) and designed to be coexpressed with green fluorescence protein (GFP) by the regulation of cytomegalovirus promoters in the adenovirus vector. bEnd3 cells showed favorable coexpression of FFHA and GFP consistent with the multiplicity of infection of the adenovirus. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that FFHA was localized at the plasma membrane, whereas GFP was predominantly located in the cytoplasm of ECs. Cell death was induced by VEGF, but not by platelet derived growth factor or fibroblast growth factor in a dose-dependent manner (range 2–20 ng/ml), and revealed caspase-dependent apoptotic profiles. The FFHA expressing bEnd3 cells underwent apoptosis when cocultured with a glioma cell (SF188V+) line able to overexpress VEGF. The combined data indicated that the FFHA adenovirus system can induce apoptotic signaling in ECs in response to VEGF, and thus, is an instrumental modification to the development of AIDD."
