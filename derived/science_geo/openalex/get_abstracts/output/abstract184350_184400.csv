https://openalex.org/W2068399149,"Most substrates of the 26 S proteasome are recognized only following conjugation to a Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain. Rad23 is one member of a family of proteins that possesses an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UbL) and a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain(s) (UBA). Recent studies have shown that UbLs interact with 26 S proteasomes, whereas UBAs bind polyubiquitin chains. These biochemical properties suggest that UbL-UBA proteins may shuttle polyubiquitinated substrates to proteasomes. Here we show that contrary to prediction from this model, the effect of human Rad23A on the degradation of polyubiquitinated substrates catalyzed by purified proteasomes is exclusively inhibitory. Strong inhibition is dependent on the presence of both UBAs, independent of the UbL, and can be explained by competition between the UBA domains and the proteasome for binding to substrate-linked polyubiquitin chains. The UBA domains bind Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains in strong preference to Lys63 or Lys29-linked chains, leading to selective inhibition of the assembly and disassembly of Lys48-linked chains. These results place constraints on the mechanism(s) by which UbL-UBA proteins promote proteasome-catalyzed proteolysis and reveal new properties of UBA domains.

The conserved protein Ub 1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; βGal, β-galactosidase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; DUB, deubiquitinating enzyme; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; polyUb, polyubiquitin (refers to a branched, isopeptide-linked ubiquitin chain); UBA, ubiquitin-associated domain; Ubal, ubiquitin aldehyde; UbL, ubiquitin-like domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography becomes covalently linked through its C terminus (Gly76) to lysine residues of substrates destined for degradation by the 26 S proteasome, a 2.5 MDa assembly consisting of a central cylindrical 20 S core complex and two distally positioned 19 S regulatory complexes (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). The 19 S complex recognizes the substrate-linked Ub signal, unfolds the substrate polypeptide, and translocates it into a sequestered active site chamber within the 20 S catalytic complex (2Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Google Scholar). The Ub-proteasome pathway plays a major role in intracellular regulation through its contribution to the homeostasis of important regulatory proteins (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar). Ub also functions as a functionally distinct signal in other intracellular processes, including protein trafficking and DNA damage tolerance (reviewed in Refs. 3Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Google Scholar and 4Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Google Scholar). In the most frequent mode of targeting to proteasomes, multiple Ubs are chained together through Lys48–Gly76isopeptide bonds, with the proximal Ub linked to a substrate lysine residue (5Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Google Scholar, 6Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Google Scholar). The architecture of this Ub signal appears to be specialized for targeting to proteasomes in vivo, whereas other signal structures may be dedicated to distinct processes (reviewed in Refs. 3Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Google Scholar and 4Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Google Scholar). Although a Lys48-linked chain of at least four Ubs in length is an autonomous signal that affords high affinity for purified proteasomes in vitro(K d of ∼50 nm, Ref. 7Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar), recent studies have suggested that factors extrinsic to the 19 S complex might assist in targeting some polyubiquitinated substrates to proteasomes. Leading candidates for such a role are members of the UbL-UBA protein family, including Rad23/Rhp23 and Dsk2/Dph1. Individual members of the UbL-UBA family were discovered by virtue of their roles in distinct biological processes, including nucleotide excision repair (Rad23, Ref. 8Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Google Scholar) and spindle pole body duplication (Dsk2, Ref. 9Biggins S. Ivanovska I. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1331-1346Google Scholar), whose relationship to protein degradation remains uncertain (see for example Refs. 10Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G.

All family members have an N-terminal Ub-like (UbL) domain that binds to a specific site in the 19 S complex (14Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1997; 391: 715-718Google Scholar, 15Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A.G. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Google Scholar), along with one or more Ub-associated (UBA) domains (16Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Google Scholar) that bind polyUb chains (and mono-Ub) (10Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Google Scholar, 17Wilkinson C.R.M. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Google Scholar, 18Chen L. Shinde U.

Saitoh A. Toh-e A. Yokosawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 986-992Google Scholar). These biochemical properties suggest that a substrate bound to a UBA domain through its polyUb chain could be shuttled to the proteasome by means of the UbL-19 S interaction (15Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A.G. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Google Scholar, 17Wilkinson C.R.M. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R.

Existing biological data both support and contradict this model. For example, the turnover of certain model proteasome substrates is retarded in rad23Δ or dsk2Δ yeast (19Funakoshi M. Sasaki T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 745-750Google Scholar, 22Rao H. Sastry A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11691-11695Google Scholar,23Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Google Scholar). Complementation of this phenotype generally requires that both the UbL and UBA domains be present (17Wilkinson C.R.M. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Google Scholar, 21Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Google Scholar, 22Rao H. Sastry A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11691-11695Google Scholar, 23Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Google Scholar). UbL-UBA proteins interact physically with S5a/Rpn10 (24Hiyama H. Yokoi M. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Maekawa T. Tanaka K. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28019-28025Google Scholar), a subunit of the 19 S complex that is also found outside the 19 S (25van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Google Scholar). UbL-UBA proteins also interact functionally with S5a/Rpn10, in that deletion of individual UbL-UBA genes together with the S5a/Rpn10 gene results in a synergistic stabilization of certain proteasome substrates (17Wilkinson C.R.M. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Google Scholar, 20Saeki Y. Saitoh A. Toh-e A. Yokosawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 986-992Google Scholar,21Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Google Scholar, 23Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Google Scholar). However, these interactions, although suggestive, do not lead to a defined functional model, in part because the specific role of S5a/Rpn10 in proteasome-catalyzed proteolysis remains uncertain (see Refs. 25van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Google Scholar and 26Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Google Scholar). Still other findings appear to be inconsistent with a critical role for UbL-UBA proteins in targeting substrates to proteasomes. For example, deletion of individual UbL-UBA genes, even together with the gene encoding Rpn10/S5a, does not inhibit the turnover of naturally short-lived proteins (23Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of UbL-UBA proteins inhibits, rather than stimulates, the turnover of natural and model proteasome substrates in yeast cells (19Funakoshi M. Sasaki T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 745-750Google Scholar, 21Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Google Scholar, 27Ortolan T.G. Tongaonkar P. Lambertson D. Chen L. Schauber C. Madura K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 601-608Google Scholar, 28Clarke D.J. Mondesert G. Segal M. Bertolaet B.L. Jensen S. Wolff M. Henze M. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1997-2007Google Scholar). The impact of UbL-UBA proteins on proteasome function has not previously been examined in a defined biochemical system. Here we report results from two different biochemical systems that are inconsistent with a simple trans-targeting function for Rad23 and by analogy, other UbL-UBA proteins. We also describe new properties of UBA domains that have a high likelihood to be relevant for the biological function(s) of these domains. Bovine lactalbumin and bovine Ub were from Sigma; Ubal was from BostonBiochem; MG-132 was from Peptides International. Poly(His) antibody (H-15) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal Rad23 antiserum was from P. Howley (Harvard Medical School, Rad23A) or Affiniti (Rad23B). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Ub were produced in rabbits by this group and affinity-purified (29Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar). P. Howley provided plasmids pGEX4T2-HHR23A and pGEX-6p-1-HHR23B. Relative to the published sequence of human Rad23A (30Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar), the sequence of Rad23 used in this work carries T131A and E150K mutations that do not lie in the UbL or UBA domains. Deleted open reading frames (ORFs) were constructed by PCR and cloned between theBamHI and SalI sites of pGEX4T2 (AmershamBiosciences). All ORFs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21pJY2 cells (31You J. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 950-954Google Scholar), absorbed onto GSH beads (Sigma), and released by thrombin cleavage or eluted with GSH and cleaved subsequently. In all experiments except Fig. 3,below, Rad23 proteins were purified further on an FPLC Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) using a salt gradient appropriate to each protein. Bovine erythrocyte 26 S proteasomes and rabbit reticulocyte fraction II were produced as described (7Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar, 32Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Google Scholar). E2–25K, His10-Mms2, UbcH5A, and the KIAA10 C-domain (CD) were expressed in bacteria and purified as described (33Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Google Scholar, 34You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar, 35Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Google Scholar). The yeast Ubc13 ORF was cloned between the BamHI and SalI sites of pGEX4T2 (Amersham Biosciences). Ubc13 was expressed in BL21pJY2 cells, absorbed onto GSH beads, and released using thrombin. Thrombin was inactivated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Ubc13 was dialyzed, concentrated, and used without further purification. The following mutant Ubs were expressed and purified by established methods (35Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Google Scholar): K29C/K48R; K48R/D77R; K48C; D77; and K63R. His6-tagged mouse E1 was expressed in Sf9 cells, using a virus provided by K. Iwai, and purified on nickel beads (Novagen). All results were replicated in two or more independent experiments. Lactalbumin degradation assays contained 2.7 mg/ml fraction II protein, 23 μm Ub (where added), ∼5 μg/ml 125I-lactalbumin (∼106cpm/μg), and buffer/cofactors as described (36Beal R.E. Toscano-Cantaffa D. Young P. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2925-2934Google Scholar). Ubiquitination and degradation were assayed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography and release of acid-soluble radioactivity, respectively (36Beal R.E. Toscano-Cantaffa D. Young P. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2925-2934Google Scholar). Linear degradation rates were corrected by subtracting the rate measured in a negative control reaction lacking added Ub. Typically, Ub stimulated the degradation rate by ∼3-fold. A new version of H10-UbDHFR was used in the present work. Relative to Ref. 7Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar: 1) Val76 of Ub was linked to DHFR with an Ala4 linker (junction sequence … LRLGVAAAAMVRP … in which L = Leu72 of Ub and M = Met1 of mouse DHFR); 2) a protein kinase A site was placed at the DHFR C terminus (final sequence … FEVYERRASVQ in which the serine residue is the phosphorylation site). H10-UbDHFR was expressed, purified, and conjugated to K48-Ub4 as described (7Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar). Degradation of Ub5DHFR by purified 26 S proteasomes was assayed under previously described conditions (7Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar) by either of two methods: 1) Western blotting against the poly(His) tag of the DHFR-fused Ub (37Sloper-Mould K.E. Jemc J. Pickart C.M. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30483-30489Google Scholar) (this Ub is degraded, Ref. 7Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar); or 2) release of32P incorporated at the kinase A site (∼3 × 105 cpm/pmol). Ub5DHFR (10 μg) was labeled in a 60-μl reaction containing: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1m NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 20 units of protein kinase A (Sigma P-2645), 40 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Carrier protein (bovine serum albumin or ovalbumin) was added to improve the recovery of Ub5DHFR. After 10 min at 37 °C, the incubation was spin-filtered through Sephadex G-25 to remove unincorporated radioactivity and stored at 5 °C for up to 1 week. The concentration of Ub5DHFR was estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. K48- and K63-Ub4 were produced as described (33Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Google Scholar, 38Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Google Scholar). Cys48 at the distal terminus of K48-Ub4 was alkylated with iodoacetamide, while K63-Ub4 carried a K63R mutation at its distal terminus. K29-Ub4 was produced by the general method used for K48-Ub4 except that the KIAA10-CD/UbcH5A (E3/E2) conjugating system was used in place of E2–25K, and all Ubs carried the K48R mutation to force the dual-specificity E3 to use K29 in chain assembly (34You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Google Scholar). Incubations (pH 8) contained KIAA10-CD, UbcH5A, and E1 at 2, 1, and 0.1 μm, respectively. To reduce Ub consumption via autoubiquitination of KIAA10-CD, we preincubated the conjugating enzymes for 20 min with 29 μm lysine-less Ub (31You J. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 950-954Google Scholar) before initiating chain assembly by adding K48R/D77-Ub and K29C/K48R-Ub (1.17 mm each). After 4 h of incubation (37 °C), enzymes were removed by passage through Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). K29-Ub2 was purified on an FPLC Mono S column (AmershamBiosciences) as described (38Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Google Scholar) and divided into two portions. One aliquot was deblocked at its proximal terminus using yeast Ub hydrolase-1 (38Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Google Scholar) and then irreversibly blocked at its distal terminus by alkylating Cys29 with iodoacetamide. The other aliquot was deblocked at its distal terminus by alkylating Cys29with ethyleneimine (Chemservice) (38Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Google Scholar). These two dimers were conjugated to each other and purified as described for K29-Ub2. All Ub4 molecules used in chain binding had an extra amino acid (Asp77) at the proximal chain terminus and carried a blocking modification/mutation at the distal terminus (see preceding paragraph). Each type of Ub4 was radioiodinated using chloramine T (8–20,0000 cpm/pmol). GST-fused Rad23/mutants were bound to GSH beads (10 pmol of protein/μl of beads). After washing with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), loaded beads (5 μl) were incubated with 1 μm125I-Ub4in a total volume of 115 μl, in binding buffer plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, either for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 5 °C. Unbound Ub4 was removed via three washes with binding buffer, the beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the released Ub4 was quantified by SDS-PAGE/phosphorimage analysis. Incubations (37 °C) contained 117 μm Ub and 0.1 μm E1, under established conditions (33Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Google Scholar, 38Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Google Scholar), for times as indicated in the legend to Fig. 6(“Results”). K48R-Ub was used to make Lys29- and Lys63-linked chains, while K29R-Ub was used to make Lys48-linked chains. Lys63-linked chains were generated at pH 7.6 using His10-Mms2 and Ubc13 (3 μm each). Lys48 and Lys29 chains were generated at pH 8 using KIAA10-CD (1 μm) and UbcH5A (0.5 μm). Chain products were detected by Ub Western blot. Data were acquired on a Biacore 3000 instrument. R23D (5000 resonance units) was immobilized by amine coupling (pH 4.5) to a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One flow cell of the chip was activated and blocked in the absence of R23D to provide a control. Signals generated in the control flow cell were subtracted from signals in the R23D flow cell. To assess the effects of Rad23 on Ub-dependent proteolysis we first used Ub-depleted reticulocyte extract (fraction II) in which the model substrate bovine lactalbumin is recognized by the N-end rule E3/E2 complex (E3α/E2–14K, equivalent to yeast Ubr1/Ubc2), conjugated to Lys48-linked polyUb chains and degraded by proteasomes (5Chau V.

Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Google Scholar). Previous studies have implicated UbL-UBA proteins in the turnover of N-end rule substrates. For example, LeuβGal, which is partially stabilized indsk2Δ yeast (19Funakoshi M. Sasaki T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 745-750Google Scholar), is polyubiquitinated through the N-end rule pathway (40Varshavsky A. Turner G. Du F. Xie Y. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 779-789Google Scholar). Mammals express two closely related isoforms of Rad23, known as Rad23A and B (30Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D.

Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Google Scholar), a function than can probably also be performed by Rad23A (41Ng J.M.Y. Vrieling H. Sugasawa K. Ooms M.P. Grootegoed J.A. Vreeburg J.T.M. Visser P. Beems R.B. Gorgels T.G.M.F. Hanaoka F. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. van der Horst G.T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1233-1245Google Scholar). We employed human Rad23A in the studies described below, which began with purification of the full-length protein and several truncation mutants (Fig. 1, Aand B). Adding a low concentration of full-length Rad23 (7 μm) to fraction II significantly inhibited lactalbumin degradation (∼50%, Fig. 2 A) and higher concentrations of Rad23 caused stronger inhibition (see Fig.3, below). Rad23 failed to stimulate degradation at any concentration tested. The lowest concentration used, 0.7 μm (data not shown), represents an excess of only ∼3-fold over the estimated concentration of proteasomes in this assay system (36Beal R.E. Toscano-Cantaffa D. Young P. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2925-2934Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that we failed to observe stimulation because of a gross excess of Rad23. An earlier study in unfractionated rabbit reticulocyte lysate attributed proteolytic inhibition by Rad23 to a competition between the UbL domain and substrate-linked polyUb chains for access to proteasomes (24Hiyama H. Yokoi M. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Maekawa T. Tanaka K. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28019-28025Google Scholar). However, we found that deleting the UbL generated a stronger inhibitor, indicating that the UbL is dispensable for inhibition (R23D, Fig.2 A; see also next paragraph). Degradation in the presence of a saturating concentration of R23D was actually slower than in the negative control without added Ub (Fig. 2 A), probably because some of the degradation in the negative control relies on a trace of Ub in fraction II and is thus subject to inhibition by R23D. Deletion analysis revealed that strong inhibition (≥50% at 7 μm) was associated with the presence of two UBAs (Rad23, R23D, UBA1–2 in Fig. 2 A). The UBAs, rather than the region between them, mediate inhibition, as shown by comparing the effects of UBA1–2 and ID in Fig. 2 A. Titration analysis showed that R23D was a potent inhibitor, displaying half-maximal inhibition at ∼3 μm (Fig. 2 B). We tentatively attribute less potent inhibition by full-length Rad23,versus UbL-deleted dual-UBA variants (Fig. 2 A), to an interaction that shields the UBA domains of the full-length protein. (As shown below, inhibition of lactalbumin degradation is probably mainly due to binding of lactalbumin-linked polyUb chains to the Rad23 UBA domains.) Consistent with this model, we found that heat treatment increased the inhibitory potency of full-length Rad23 but had little effect on inhibition by R23D (Fig. 3, data for 7 μm inhibitor). Rad23 was reported to homodimerize through a UBA-UBA interaction (42Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 955-963Google Scholar), but recent NMR results exclude self-interaction of minimal UBA domains (43Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Google Scholar). NMR results also exclude self-association of minimal UbL domains (44Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Google Scholar). Stronger proteolytic inhibition by R23D versus Rad23 (Figs. 2 A and 3) is therefore most simply explained by an intra- or intermoleular interaction between the UbL and UBA domains that is disrupted upon heating so as to increase accessibility of polyUb chains to the UBAs. The proposed conformational transition could also increase accessibility of the UbL, as suggested by the results of Rad23-proteasome interaction studies (15Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A.G. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Google Scholar). Further work will be necessary to validate this conformational model. In the fraction II system, the extract provides both Ub-conjugating and proteasome activities. Rad23 was previously found to inhibit E2-catalyzed histone polyubiquitination (27Ortolan T.G. Tongaonkar P. Lambertson D. Chen L. Schauber C. Madura K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 601-608Google Scholar), suggesting that UbL-UBA proteins could inhibit proteolysis by inhibiting Ub-substrate conjugation. To rigorously determine if Rad23 inhibits 26 S proteasome activity, we studied the degradation of a polyubiquitinated model substrate by purified proteasomes. The high affinity of Ub5DHFR for proteasomes (K m, ∼35 nm) is due solely to the binding of its polyUb chain to the 19 S complex (7Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Google Scholar), where the chain contacts the S6′/Rpt5 ATPase (26Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Google Scholar). The structure of Ub5DHFR resembles that of conjugated forms of UbProβGal, a Ubfusion degradation (UFD) substrate whose intracellular degradation depends on the extension of a polyUb chain from either Lys48 or Lys29 of a non-cleavable Ub moiety (45Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Google Scholar). UbProβGal is strongly stabilized inrad23Δ or dsk2Δ yeast (22Rao H. Sastry A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11691-11695Google Scholar, 23Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Google Scholar). We therefore anticipated that a stimulatory effect of Rad23 would be manifested with Ub5DHFR. Instead, full-length Rad23 inhibited the degradation of this substrate in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 6 versus 4). Low levels of Rad23 are found associated with affinity-purified proteasomes from budding yeast (46Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Google Scholar), consistent with the demonstrated interaction of the Rad23 UbL with the 19 S complex (14Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1997; 391: 715-718Google Scholar, 15Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A.G. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Google Scholar). Stimulation of degradation by Rad23 could have been missed in the above described experiment (Fig. 4 A) if our purified proteasomes were already saturated with Rad23. However, quantitative Western blotting showed that Rad23A, although detectable in the purified proteasomes, was substantially substoichiometric relative to an integral 19 S subunit, S6′/Rpt5 (Fig.5 B, estimated content ∼0.3 mol of Rad23A/mol19S), while Rad23B"

In the present report, LPLDact was purified from 3T3F442A adipocyte-conditioned medium and identified as the type II ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase, autotaxin (ATX). A unique ATX cDNA was cloned from 3T3F442A adipocytes, and its recombinant expression in COS-7 cells led to extracellular release of LPLDact. ATX mRNA expression was highly up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3F442A-preadipocytes. This up-regulation was paralleled by the ability of newly differentiated adipocytes to release LPLDact and LPA. Differentiation-dependent up-regulation of ATX expression was also observed in a primary culture of mouse preadipocytes. Treatment of 3T3F442A-preadipocytes with concentrated conditioned medium from ATX-expressing COS-7 cells led to an increase in cell number as compared with concentrated conditioned medium from ATX non-expressing COS-7 cells. The specific effect of ATX on preadipocyte proliferation was completely suppressed by co-treatment with a LPA-hydrolyzing phospholipase, phospholipase B. Finally, ATX expression was found in mature adipocytes isolated from mouse adipose tissue and was substantially increased in genetically obese-diabeticdb/db mice when compared with their lean siblings. In conclusion, the present work shows that ATX is responsible for the LPLDact released by adipocytes and exerts a paracrine control on preadipocyte growth via an LPA-dependent mechanism. Up-regulations of ATX expression with adipocyte differentiation and genetic obesity suggest a possible involvement of this released protein in the development of adipose tissue and obesity-associated pathologies. Our group has recently demonstrated (Gesta, S., Simon, M., Rey, A., Sibrac, D., Girard, A., Lafontan, M., Valet, P., and Saulnier-Blache, J. S. (2002) J.

In obesity, excessive accumulation of triacylglycerol in adipocytes (hypertrophy) results from an alteration in the balance between lipogenic and/or lipolytic activities of the adipocytes. It is now recognized that, beside their involvement in lipid homeostasis, adipocytes also produce and secrete numerous factors. Among them are endocrine peptides (leptin, adiponectin, angiotensinogen, etc.) which may play an important role in the development of morbid complications of obesity such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Other adipocyte-secreted factors (tumor necrosis factor, fatty acids, eicosanoids, lysophosphatidic acid, etc.) are produced locally and may influence adipose tissue development and/or metabolism by exerting autocrine/paracrine effects on the different cells composing adipose tissue (adipocytes, preadipocytes, and endothelial cells) (1Spiegelman B.M.

Of particular interest is the ability of some adipocyte-secreted factors to exert a paracrine control on preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation, cellular processes leading to the recruitment of new fat cells in adipose tissue (adipogenesis) and a further increase in adipose tissue mass (3Hausman D.B.

Our group has demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)1 is released from adipocytes in vitro and is present in vivo in the extracellular fluid of adipose tissue collected by microdialysis (5Valet P.

In parallel, LPA is able to activate preadipocyte motility and proliferation by interacting preferentially with the LPA1 receptor (LPA1-R) (6Pagès C. Daviaud D. An S. Krief S. Lafontan M. Valet P.

LPA is a bioactive phospholipid regulating a wide range of cellular responses (proliferation, survival, motility, ion flux, and secretion) through the activation of the G-protein-coupled receptors LPA1-, LPA2-, and LPA3-R (7Tigyi G.

We recently showed that, in parallel to LPA, adipocytes also release a LPA-synthesizing activity that was characterized as a lysophospholipase D activity (LPLDact), catalyzing transformation of lysophosphatidylcholine into LPA (17Gesta S. Simon M. Rey A. Sibrac D. Girard A. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 904-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocyte LPL Dact is soluble and sensitive to cobalt ions (17Gesta S. Simon M. Rey A. Sibrac D. Girard A. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 904-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, adipocyte lysophospholipase D activity is insensitive to primary alcohol, suggesting that it could be catalyzed by a non-conventional phospholipase D that remains to be identified. In the present study, adipocyte LPLD activity was purified and identified as the type II ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase autotaxin (ATX). ATX was found to be expressed by and released from adipocytes, activates preadipocyte proliferation, and its expression was strongly up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation and in a model of genetic obesity. Because of its LPLDact, adipocyte-ATX leads to LPA synthesis and could be involved in the control of adipose tissue development as well as in obesity-associated pathologies. The mouse preadipose cell line 3T3F442A (18Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) was grown and differentiated as described previously (19Bétuing S. Valet P. Lapalu S. Peyroulan D. Hickson G. Daviaud D. Lafontan M. Saulnier-Blache J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1997; 235: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluence (day 0 of differentiation) in DMEM supplemented with 10% donor calf serum and then shifted in a differentiating medium consisting in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum plus 50 nm insulin. In these culture conditions, quiescent preadipocytes differentiate into functional adipocytes. COS-7 monkey cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected using DEAE-dextran as reported previously (20Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). 3T3F442A cells or COS-7 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove serum and incubated (5 ml for a 10-cm diameter plate; 1 ml for a 3-cm diameter plate) in serum-free DMEM supplemented (for LPA release) or not (for LPLDact release) with 1% free fatty acid BSA at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 7% CO2. Conditioned media were also prepared from adipose tissue by incubating 300–500 mg of finely cut out subcutaneous adipose tissue from db/+ ordb/db mice in 3 ml of serum-free DMEM to measure released LPLDact. After various time of incubation (0–5 h for measurement of LPLD activity; 7 h for quantification of LPA and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)), conditioned medium (CM) was separated from the cells or tissue, centrifuged to eliminate cell debris, and stored at −20 °C before measurement of LPLDact or quantification of LPA. In some experiments, conditioned media were concentrated (about 50-fold) using an Amicon Ultra 10,000 (Millipore). After adjustment of the protein concentration, concentrated conditioned media (CCM) were aliquoted and stored at −20 °C before use. LPLDact was measured by conversion of radiolabeled LPC into radiolabeled LPA as described previously (21Tokumura A. Miyabe M. Yoshimoto O. Shimizu M. Fukuzawa K. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A solution of [14C]palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 55.8 mCi/mmol) at 0.0025 μCi/μl in DMEM supplemented with 1% free fatty acid BSA was first prepared, and 20 μl of this solution was incubated with 500 μl of thawed CM plus 1 μl of sodium orthovanadate (0.5 mm) for 90 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, phospholipids were extracted with 500 μl of 1-butanol, evaporated, spotted on a silica gel 60 TLC glass plate (Merck), and separated using CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH (60:35:8) as the migration solvent. The plate was autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C using a Biomax-MS film (Kodak) to localize radiolabeled LPA spots, which were scraped and counted with 3 ml of scintillation mixture. All the procedures were performed at 0–4 °C. One hundred twenty milliliters of 3T3F442A adipocyte-conditioned medium containing LPLDact was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to remove cell debris and concentrated 8-fold on polyethylene glycol 20,000 (PEG 20,000). After overnight dialysis against 10 liters of purification buffer (PB) using Spectra-Por 1.7 ml/cm tubing (Pierce Chemicals, Interchim) to remove salts and small proteins, 16 ml of the concentrated medium was applied (60 ml/h) onto a heparin-Sepharose column (CL+6B, Amersham Biosciences; 15-ml packed volume) equilibrated with 100 ml of PB. The column was washed with 150 ml of PB and eluted with 125 ml of PB containing 0.5 m NaCl. The elution fraction containing LPLDact was dialyzed overnight against 10 liters of PB using Spectra-Por 1.7 ml/cm tubing (Pierce Chemicals, Interchim) to remove NaCl and concentrated on PEG 20,000 to obtain a volume of 40 ml. This concentrate was applied (60 ml/h) on a phosphocellulose column (P11, Whatman, 15 ml packed volume) equilibrated with 100 ml PB. The column was washed with 150 ml of PB and eluted with 125 ml of PB containing 0.5 m NaCl. The elution fraction containing LPLDact was dialyzed overnight against 10 liters of purification buffer using Spectra-Por 1.7 ml/cm tubing (Pierce Chemicals, Interchim) to remove NaCl, and concentrated on PEG 20,000 to obtain a final volume of 5 ml. This concentrate was separated (30 ml/h) over a gel filtration column (HiLoad 16/60, Superdex 200 PrepGrade, Amersham Biosciences) on an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system previously equilibrated with PB. The column was eluted with the same buffer. Aliquots of the collected fractions were assayed for LPLDact. All the fractions containing LPLDact were pooled and concentrated 10 times on dialysis tubing (0.5 ml/cm) in PEG 20,000. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Protassay, Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE (4–20%) was performed according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) followed by SYPRO Ruby or colloidal blue staining. After the addition of sample buffer (Novex, Invitrogen), concentrated fractions from gel filtration were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Electrophoretic separation of proteins was carried out on a 1-mm thick 8 × 6-cm gel 10% acrylamide. A 40-μg portion of total protein in sample buffer was loaded into a 4-mm well of the gel and separated at 40 mA. A total of 30 μg of standards (Mark12, Invitrogen) migrated in a neighboring lane. After coloration with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Biosafe, Bio-Rad), the 110-kDa protein was cut, reduced, and alkylated using dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide, respectively, and subjected to digestion with trypsin overnight following the protocol of Shevchenko et al. (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7853) Google Scholar). Gel pieces were successively washed with ammonium bicarbonate and dehydrated with acetonitrile. After drying in a Speedvac (Heto), the pieces were incubated at 56 °C with 10 mm dithiothreitol and then at room temperature with 55 mm iodoacetamide. After successive washing steps with ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, the gel pieces were completely dried in the Speedvac. Trypsin solution (Promega) was added, and digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C. Peptide digests were extracted successively with acetonitrile and 5% formic acid. Before analysis, the peptides were dried in the Speedvac, diluted in 5% formic acid, and desalted on Poros R-2 resin. Peptides were eluted with 2 μl of 60% methanol/1% formic acid directly into nanospray capillary needles (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Peptides were analyzed on a Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer (Micromass). MS acquisitions were performed within the mass range of 550–1300 m/zand MS/MS within 50–2000 m/z. Amino acid sequences were used to search Swiss-Prot and TREMBL with BLAST interface (United States National Center for Biotechnology Information). Partial amino acid sequences (sequence TAG) were used to search the data bases with PeptideSearch interface (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany). Hits were confirmed by performing a theoretical trypsin digestion with GPMAW (Lighthouse data, Odense, Denmark) and comparing the resulting peptide mass and sequence to those obtained experimentally. Total RNAs were isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Total RNAs (1 μg) were reverse transcribed for 60 min at 37 °C using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of a random hexamer. A minus RT reaction was performed in parallel to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. Real time RT-PCR was performed starting with 25 ng cDNA and 900 nm (human ATX and mouse ATX) or 900 nm (mouse ap2) concentration of both sense and antisense primers in a final volume of 25 μl using the SYBR green TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence was monitored and analyzed in a GeneAmp 5700 detection system instrument (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of the 18 S ribosomal RNA was performed in parallel using the ribosomal RNA control Taqman Assay Kit (Applied Biosystem) to normalize gene expression. Results are expressed as 2(Ct18S − Ctgene), where Ct corresponds to the number of cycles needed to generate a fluorescent signal above a predefined threshold. Oligonucleotide primers were designed using the Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oligonucleotides used were as follows: mouse aP2, sense 5′-TTCGATGAAATCACCGCAGA-3′ and antisense 5′-GGTCGACTTTCCATCCCACTT-3′; mouse ATX, sense 5′-GACCCTAAAGCCATTATTGCTAA-3′ and antisense 5′-GGGAAGGTGCTGTTTCATGT-3′; mouse HSL, sense 5′-GGCTTACTGGGCACAGATACCT-3′ and antisense 5′-CTGAAGGCTCTGAGTTGCTCAA-3′. Total RNA from 15 days post-confluent 3T3F442A adipocytes was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA (corresponding to 1 μg of total RNA) was amplified using a program consisting of 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min with a pre- and post-incubation of 95 °C for 2 min and 72 for 10 min, respectively. PCR amplification utilized oligonucleotide primers based on the GenBankTM entry for mouse autotaxin (forward 59–64, reverse 2630–2651, accession number BC003264). The PCR fragment was isolated and ligated into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) downstream of the FLAG peptide sequence (Sigma). The recombinant plasmid, designated pcDNA-mATX-FLAG, was sequenced on both strands by automated sequencing. LPA was butanol-extracted from conditioned medium and quantified using a radioenzymatic assay as described previously (11Saulnier-Blache J.S. Girard A. Simon M.F. Lafontan M. Valet P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1947-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of lysophosphatidylcholine present in conditioned media was determined as described previously (17Gesta S. Simon M. Rey A. Sibrac D. Girard A. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 904-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after 30 min of treatment with bacterial phospholipase D followed by LPA quantification. Male C57BL/KsJdb/db and db/+ mice (Jackson Laboratory) were housed in an animal room maintained at 22 °C on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Animals were handled in accordance with the principles and guidelines established by the National Institute of Medical Research (INSERM). On the day of sacrifice, mouse blood was collected on heparin and glucose was immediately measured with a glucose meter (Glucometer 4; Bayer Diagnosis, Puteaux, France). Perigonadic and inguinal white adipose tissues were removed, and adipocytes were isolated as described above and immediately processed for RNA extraction using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The other tissues (interscapular brown adipose tissue, brain, kidney, and liver) were removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before RNA isolation using RNA STAT kit (AMS Biotechnology Ltd., Oxon, UK). Adipose tissue was dissected from mice and digested in 5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 1 mg/ml collagenase, 1% BSA, and 2 μg/ml gentamycin for 45–60 min at 37 °C under shaking. Digestion was followed by filtration through a 100-μm screen and centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at room temperature. This phase allowed the separation of floating adipocytes from the pellet containing the stromal-vascular fraction. Adipocytes were washed twice in DMEM and further processed for RNA extraction using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The stromal-vascular pellet was washed twice in DMEM and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (7 mm tris, 0.83% NH4Cl, pH 7.6) for 3 min to get rid of erythrocytes and then seeded in 12-well plates (150,000 cells per plate) in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After overnight culture, the medium was replaced by a serum-free differentiating medium consisting of DMEM/Ham's F12 supplemented with transferrin (10 μg/ml), biotin (33 μm), insulin (66 nm), T3 (1 nm), and pantothenate (17 μm). That time point is considered as day 0. In these conditions, adipocyte differentiation occurs a few days later (24Deslex S. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were prepared at different time points after induction of the differentiation using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). To identify the enzyme responsible for LPLDact present in adipocyte CM (17Gesta S. Simon M. Rey A. Sibrac D. Girard A. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 904-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its purification from 3T3F442A adipocyte CM was undertaken. LPLDact hydrolyzes the phosphocholine bound in LPC to generate LPA and free choline. In the present work, LPLDact was measured using [14C]lysopalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine as substrate, followed by TLC separation of synthesized [14C]LPA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The initial release of LPLDact in adipocyte CM was observed in an Hepes buffer incubation medium (17Gesta S. Simon M. Rey A. Sibrac D. Girard A. Lafontan M. Valet P. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 904-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, a stronger (3.3-fold after 5 h of incubation) LPLDact was measured when using DMEM as the incubation medium. In both incubation media, LPLDact was detectable after a 30-min incubation and reached a maximum after 5 h. Based upon these results, purification of LPLDact was undertaken from 3T3F442A adipocyte CM prepared after 5 h of incubation in DMEM. After 10-fold concentration, CM was first applied onto a heparin affinity chromatography column (Fig. 2,section 1), washed and eluted with 0.5m NaCl at once (lane e), and concentrated again. This allowed the recovery of LPLDact, but no specific band was identified by SDS-PAGE (lane f). As a second purification step, concentrated fraction eluted from the heparin column was applied onto a phosphocellulose column (Fig. 2), eluted at 0.2 m NaCl (lane i), concentrated 25 times (lane j), applied on a gel filtration column (Fig. 2, section 3), and eluted (Fig. 2, section 3,fractions 52 to 82). LPLDact was detected in fractions 68 to 76. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of a band (molecular mass between 116 and 97 kDa) in the fractions exhibiting maximal LPLD activity (fractions 70, 72, and 74). Fraction 70 was concentrated 100 times, separated by 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with Coomassie Blue, and cut out from the gel. Tryptic cleavage followed by tandem mass spectrometry of the specific band of fraction 70 led to the generation of 27 peptides exhibiting 100% homology (TableI) with mouse ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase (ENPP2), also called autotaxin (25Stracke M.L.

This cDNA exhibited 100% identity with previously identified mouse-ATX cDNA present in the GenBankTM data base (BC003264, NM_015744, AF123542) (TableI). The corresponding protein is composed of 863 amino acids (molecular mass of ∼100 kDa) which, by analogy with human, corresponds to the previously described β-form (27Kawagoe H. Soma O. Goji J.

Here we show that at submicromolar concentrations (0.1–0.5 μm) 15d-PGJ2 retains the ability to suppress the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and nitric oxide (NO) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine J774 macrophages under the conditions of a prolonged incubation (>12 h). Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of the cytoprotective enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), was induced and coincident with the anti-inflammatory action of 15d-PGJ2. Inhibition of HO-1 activity or scavenging carbon monoxide (CO), a byproduct derived from heme degradation, significantly attenuated the suppressive activity of 15d-PGJ2. Furthermore, LPS-induced NF-κB activation assessed by the inhibitory protein of NF-κB(IκB) degradation and p50 nuclear translocation was diminished in cells subjected to prolonged treatment with the low concentration of 15d-PGJ2. Treatment of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, or the specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, blocked the induction of HO-1 and suppression of LPS-induced IκB degradation mediated by 15d-PGJ2. Likewise, HO inhibitor and CO scavenger were effective in abolishing the inhibitory effects of 15d-PGJ2 on NF-κB activation induced by LPS. The functional role of CO was further demonstrated by the use of a CO releasing molecule, tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer, which significantly suppressed LPS-induced nuclear translocation of p50 as assessed by confocal immunofluorescence. Collectively, these data suggest that even at submicromolar concentrations 15d-PGJ2 can exert an anti-inflammatory effect in macrophages through a mechanism that involves the action of HO/CO. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a cyclopentenone prostaglandin, displays a potent anti-inflammatory effect at micromolar concentrations (>2 μm) through direct inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation.

The biological effects of 15d-PGJ2 have attracted considerable interest in recent years. It was initially identified as a high affinity natural ligand for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and shown to exert several effects through binding to this nuclear receptor (2Forman B.M.

Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). More recently, several recent studies have shown that 15d-PGJ2 exhibits a potent anti-inflammatory effect by attenuating the expression of proinflammatory mediators in activated monocytes/macrophages mainly through the inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription of inflammatory genes (6Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar, 7Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In addition to antagonizing the NF-κB activity through PPARγ-dependent mechanism (6Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar, 7Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 8Li M. Pascual G.

It has also been shown that the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group of 15d-PGJ2 can act as an electrophile to react covalently with specific cysteine residues located in the activation loop of IκB kinase-β and the DNA binding domains of NF-κB subunits, in combination leading to the suppression of NF-κB-mediated transactivation (9Straus D.S.

Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PPARγ is required for the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on the modulation of macrophage lipid metabolism but not for its inhibitory effect on the production of inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that the PPARγ-independent mechanism may account for the major anti-inflammatory action of 15d-PGJ2. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a stress-inducible enzyme, catalyzing the degradation of heme to liberate free iron, carbon monoxide (CO), and biliverbin in mammalian cells (14Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 15Abraham N.G. Drummond G.S. Lutton J.D. Kappas A. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 6: 129-168Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Over the past few years, numerous studies have revealed the important function of HO-1 as a cytoprotective defense mechanism against oxidative insults through the antioxidant activities of biliverdin and its metabolite, bilirubin, as well as the anti-inflammatory action of CO (16Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1029-L1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that 15d-PGJ2 induces in vitro HO-1 expression in various cell types (17Colville-Nash P.R. Qureshi S.S. Willis D. Willoughby D.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 978-984PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kitamura Y. Kakimura J. Matsnoka Y. Nomura Y. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Taniguichi T. Neurosci.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the repression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression by 15d-PGJ2 in macrophages is correlated with the induction of HO-1 (17Colville-Nash P.R. Qureshi S.S. Willis D. Willoughby D.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 978-984PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to date it is not clear if HO-1 expression is functionally related to the anti-inflammatory function of 15d-PGJ2. In view of its potent anti-inflammatory activity, 15d-PGJ2 has been suggested to play a feedback regulatory role in the resolution phase of inflammation and is considered as a potential therapeutic target for treating inflammatory diseases (20Straus D.S. Glass C.K. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 185-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). However, some recent studies have revealed that 15d-PGJ2 at concentrations (>2 μm) required to elicit direct inhibition of NF-κB activation would induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-8, and potentiate the inflammatory response (21Harris S.G. Smith R.S. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1372-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Zhang X. Wang J.M. Ging W.H. Mukaida N. Young H.A. J.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 5318-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To resolve this apparent contradiction, it is important to explore the possibility that 15d-PGJ2 at lower concentrations can exert anti-inflammatory function through alternate mechanisms. In the present study, we assessed the differential effects of 15d-PGJ2 at 5 μm and at a submicromolar concentration (0.5 μm) on the production of inflammatory mediators as well as the NF-κB activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated J774 macrophages. We found that 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 was capable of preventing the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-activated cells incubated in culture for >12 h. Furthermore, LPS-induced NF-κB activation was significantly suppressed by the prolonged treatment with this low concentration of 15d-PGJ2. The delayed anti-inflammatory effect was paralleled by the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Additional experiments provide convincing evidence to support the involvement of HO-1 in the anti-inflammatory function of 15d-PGJ2 in macrophages at submicromolar concentrations. Materials—LPS from Escherichia coli (serotype 055:B5) was from Difco. 15d-PGJ2 was obtained from Cayman and Biomol. Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP), and copper protoporphyrin IX (CuPP) were from Porphyrin Products Inc. SB203580 and PD98059 were from Calbiochem. Ruthenium chloride and tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer were obtained from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal HO-1 antibody was from StressGen. Rabbit polyclonal iNOS antibody, rabbit polyclonal IκBα antibody, and goat polyclonal p50 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz. Cell Culture—Murine J774 macrophages (ATCC, TIB-67) were sub-cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells at 60% confluence were changed to serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and subjected to various treatments. Determination of TNF-α and Nitrite Concentrations—The concentration of TNF-α in culture medium was determined using an EIA kit (Assay Designs). Accumulated nitrite, a stable breakdown product of NO, in culture medium was determined using the Griess reagent. Briefly, an aliquot of cell culture medium was mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent and then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The azo dye production was determined by the absorbance at 540 nm. Sodium nitrite was used as a standard. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were rinsed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 10 min. After sonication for 30 s using microprobe sonicator, crude extracts were subjected to centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (cell lysates) were collected and protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. To prepare nuclear extracts, cells were lyzed in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were pelleted at 13,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatants (nuclear extracts) were collected and stored at -70 °C until use. Fifty μg of cell lysates or nuclear extracts was electrophoresed on 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transblotted onto the Immobilon™-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The Western blots were carried out as described previously (24Wang L-J. Lee T-S. Lee F-Y. Pai R-C. Chau L-Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 711-720PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on cover slips and subjected to various treatments were subsequently washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and permeabilized with 70% alcohol for 2 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding of the fixed cells was blocked in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation with goat anti-p50 antibodies (1:50) at 37 °C for 1 h. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with anti-goat biotin-conjugated antibody (1:100) at 37 °C for another 1 h. After washing, cells incubated with FITC-conjugated streptoavidin (1:100) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on slide with 80% glycerol, and the fluorescence was visualized using a laser confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC-1000) coupled with an image analysis system. Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was duplicated at least three-times. Results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed by Student's t test with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Differential Effects of 15d-PGJ2at High and Low Concentrations on LPS-induced TNF-α Production—To explore the possible differential effects of 15d-PGJ2 on the production of inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS in macrophages at high and low micromolar concentrations, we treated J774 cells with 15d-PGJ2 at 0.5 and 5 μm, respectively, at various time intervals relative to the addition of LPS in culture. As shown in Fig. 1A, 5 μm 15d-PGJ2 added prior to or concurrently with LPS completely blocked TNF-α production induced by LPS. The inhibitory effect, however, was gradually lost when it was added after LPS treatment. In experiments with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2, the inhibition on LPS-induced TNF-α production was not observed until cells were incubated with 15d-PGJ2 for at least 12 h prior to LPS addition. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of HO-1 was evident at 3 and 12 h after treatment with 5 and 0.5 μm of 15d-PGJ2, respectively. 15d-PGJ2 at 5 μm was effective in suppressing LPS-induced TNF-α production even at the time period that HO-1 expression was not detectable. In contrast, when cells treated with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2, the suppression on TNF-α production was not observed until the time at which HO-1 was induced. At submicromolar concentrations, the inhibitory effect of 15-PGJ2 on LPS-induced TNF-α production was closely correlated with HO-1 induction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). HO-1 Mediates the Suppressive Effect of a Submicromolar Concentration of 15d-PGJ2on the Production of TNF-α and NO in LPS-activated Macrophages—To assess the potential role of HO-1 on the inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α production in cells after prolonged treatment with a low concentration of 15d-PGJ2, J774 cells were pretreated with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 for 14 h, followed by addition of a HO competitive inhibitor, ZnPP, or an inactive compound, CuPP, for 4 h prior to LPS challenge. As shown in Fig. 2A, ZnPP treatment significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 on TNF-α production, whereas CuPP showed no effect, suggesting HO-1 mediates the suppressive effect of 15d-PGJ2. As CO derived from heme degradation by HO-1 has been shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory effect (25Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Lu H.T. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar), additional experiments were carried out to examine the effect of hemoglobin, a scavenger for CO, on TNF-α production under the same experimental setting. The results clearly show that hemoglobin effectively reversed the inhibition on LPS-induced TNF-α production by prolonged treatment with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Similar experiments were performed to examine whether the production of NO, another important inflammatory mediator induced by LPS in macrophages (26MacMicking J. Xie O.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar), might also be affected by the treatment with low concentration of 15d-PGJ2. As shown in Fig. 3A, prolonged treatment of J774 cells with submicromolar concentrations of 15-PGJ2 dose-dependently resulted in reduced iNOS expression and NO production following LPS challenge. Prolonged treatment with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 completely blocked the LPS-induced expression of iNOS and NO production, whereas cotreatment with ZnPP or hemoglobin again significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 3, B and C)Fig. 3HO-1 mediates the suppression of LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production in J774 cells following prolonged treatment with submicromolar concentrations of 15d-PGJ2.A, cells were incubated without (control) or with 1 μg/ml LPS in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations of 15-PGJ2 (0.1–0.5 μm) in culture for 18 h. *, p < 0.25 compared with cells treated with LPS alone. B and C, cells were incubated without or with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 and 1 μg/ml LPS for 12 h, followed by treatment without or with ZnPP (1 μm), CuPP (1 μm), or hemoglobin (Hb) (2.5–20 μm) for additional 6 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and the expression levels of iNOS and β-actin were examined by Western blot analysis.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of cells with 5 μm 15d-PGJ2 for 30 min significantly suppressed the degradation of IκBα as well as the increase of nuclear level of NF-κB p50 subunit following LPS stimulation. Under these conditions, HO-1 was not yet detectably induced and ZnPP treatment did not influence the effect of 15d-PGJ2, indicating that HO-1 was not involved. To determine whether prolonged treatment of cells with 0.5 μm 15-PGJ2 also affects the NF-κB activation, we studied IκBα degradation as well as level of nuclear p50 in cells pretreated with 0.5 μm of 15d-PGJ2 for 18 h followed by LPS challenge. As shown in Fig. 5A, both IκBα degradation and the increase of nuclear p50 induced by LPS were substantially reduced in cells pretreated with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2. Furthermore, ZnPP cotreatment significantly reduced the inhibitory effect, suggesting HO-1 mediates the suppression of NF-κB activation by 15d-PGJ2. To further explore the effect of HO-1 on NF-κB activation, additional experiments were performed using CoPP, a HO-1 inducer. Similar to the effect of 0.5 μm 15 d-PGJ2, pretreatment of cells with CoPP suppressed NF-κB activation induced by LPS (Fig. 5B). The suppressive effect of CoPP was inhibited by cotreatment with ZnPP as shown in the same figure. To further confirm the importance of HO-1 induction in the suppression of NF-κB activation, cells were pretreated with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 for 6 h, followed by cycloheximide, the protein synthesis inhibitor, for 12 h prior to LPS stimulation. As shown in Fig. 6, HO-1 expression induced by 15d-PGJ2 was substantially reduced. Conversely, the LPS-induced IκBα degradation was not significantly affected under the same conditions. In a separate experiment, we found that the induction of HO-1 by 15d-PGJ2 was inhibited by SB 203580, a specific inhibitor for p38 MAP kinase (28Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7A). Again, SB203580 treatment blocked the inhibitory effect of 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 on IκBα degradation induced by LPS (Fig. 7B).Fig. 5HO-1 mediates the suppressive effect of 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 on LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Cells were incubated with or without 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 (A) or 1 μm CoPP (B) for 14 h, followed by treatment with or without 1 μm ZnPP for 4 h prior to LPS (1 μg/ml) stimulation for 30 min.

As illustrated in Fig. 8, A and B, hemoglobin treatment significantly reversed the inhibition of LPS-induced IκBα degradation as well as increase of nuclear p50 by 15-PGJ2 or CoPP. The involvement of HO/CO in mediating the inhibition of NF-κB activation was also revealed by p50 confocal immunofluoresence. The 15d-PGJ2-mediated suppression on LPS-induced p50 nuclear translocation was substantially attenuated by ZnPP or hemoglobin treatment (Fig. 9). Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer, a CO releasing compound (29Motterlini R. Clark J.E. Foresti R. Sarathchandra P. Mann B.E. Gree C.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: E17-E24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for 30 min exhibited similar suppressive effects on LPS-induced p50 nuclear translocation (Fig. 10).Fig. 9Inhibition of LPS-induced nuclear localization of p50 by prolonged treatment with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2.

Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1029-L1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its pivotal role in regulating iron homeostasis, HO-1 has been shown to display potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory functions through the actions of end products derived from heme degradation, bilirubin and CO, respectively. Most recently, a study from our laboratory has demonstrated that HO-1 is induced by interleukin-10 and mediates the anti-inflammatory effect of this cytokine (30Lee T-S. Chau L-Y. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). A study by Scapagnini et al. (31Scapagnini G. Foresti R. Calabrese V. Stella A.M.G. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 3: 554-561Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar) has also shown that two polyphenolic natural products with anti-inflammatory properties, curcumin and caffeic acid phenyl ester, are HO-1 inducers, although the relevance of HO-1 expression to their anti-inflammatory actions remains to be determined. 15d-PGJ2, an anti-inflammatory prostaglandin produced at the sites of inflammation, is also capable of up-regulating the expression of HO-1 (17Colville-Nash P.R.

Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at such high concentrations, 15d-PGJ2 can induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (21Harris S.G. Smith R.S. Phipps R.P. J.

Nevertheless, several recent studies using animal disease models have demonstrated in vivo the beneficial effect of 15d-PGJ2 (19Wayman N.S. Hattori Y. Mcdonald M.C. Mota-Filipe H. Cuzzocrea S.

As much interest has been drawn on its therapeutic potentials, we are interested in elucidating the possibility whether 15d-PGJ2 can exert anti-inflammatory effect through other mechanism(s). In the present study, we show that 15d-PGJ2 at concentration of 5 μm elicited a profound inhibition on TNF-α production even when it was added at 30 min after LPS challenge in J774 cells. In contrast, the suppressive effect of 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 was observed only after a prolonged incubation period (12–18 h) prior to LPS treatment, indicating that differential mechanisms mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of 15d-PGJ2 at high and low concentrations. Since the time course experiment indicated a close correlation between HO-1 expression and the suppression on LPS-induced TNF-α production in cells treated with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2, it provoked our interest to examine the potential role of HO-1 in the anti-inflammatory effect of 15d-PGJ2 at the low submicromolar concentrations. In addition to the inhibitory effect on TNF-α production, prolonged treatment of cells with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2 also resulted in the reduced iNOS expression and NO production following LPS stimulation. To investigate whether the NF-κB activation, a key signaling pathway leading to iNOS gene expression (34Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is an upstream target for the suppressive effect of low concentration of 15d-PGJ2, we further examined the extent of IκBα degradation and the nuclear abundance of NF-κB subunit, p50, in these cells. Our results clearly demonstrate that both IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation of p50 induced by LPS are significantly attenuated in cells after prolonged treatment with 0.5 μm 15d-PGJ2. Similar to the suppressive effects on TNF-α and NO production, the inhibitory effect on NF-κB activation was also diminished by HO/CO inhibitors. Furthermore, blockade of HO-1 induction by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximde, or the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, completely abolished the suppressive effect of the low concentration 15d-PGJ2 on NF-κB activation in J774 cells. Together, these data strongly support the assertion that HO-1 in macrophages mediates the anti-inflammatory effect of 15d-PGJ2 at least at low submicromolar concentrations. Consistent with our observations, a recent study on a rat model of acute myocardial infarction also supports the role of HO-1 in the cardioprotective effect of 15d-PGJ2 (19Wayman N.S. Hattori Y. Mcdonald M.C. Mota-Filipe H. Cuzzocrea S. Pisano B. Chatterjee P.K. Thiemermann C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The finding that CO mediates the inhibition on NF-κB activation is novel. It has been shown that CO exerts the anti-inflammatory effect through modulating the activation of p38 MAP kinase, although the detailed mechanism is not yet clear. In the present study, we demonstrate that the CO releasing compound, tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer, effectively suppresses the nuclear translocation of the p50 as revealed by immunofluorescence staining. During the preparation of this manuscript, a work published by Sarady et al. (35Sarady J.K. Otterbein S.L. Liu F. Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that CO suppresses LPS-induced expression of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor through inhibiting NF-κB activation. As the molecules involved in the signaling pathway leading to NF-κB activation do not contain heme moiety, the identity of the direct target for CO action remains to be determined. Very recently, a report by Brouard et al. (36Brouard S. Berberat P.O. Tobiasch E. Seldon M.P. Bach F.H. Soares M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17950-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) showed that HO/CO did not induce NF-κB activation, but the ability of CO to protect endothelial cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis required the expression of NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes. The potential effect of CO-mediated suppression on NF-κB activation in their experimental settings is not clear. Nevertheless, they found that quiescent endothelial cells have basal nuclear NF-κB activity and express basal levels of NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes. It is speculated that CO did not affect the basal NF-κB activity required to support the protective effect of CO. Furthermore, p38 MAP kinase activation has also been implicated in the anti-apoptotic effect of CO (36Brouard S. Berberat P.O. Tobiasch E. Seldon M.P. Bach F.H. Soares M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17950-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It is envisioned that the protective function of CO in TNF-α-treated endothelial cells is influenced by the interaction between NF-κB and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways. In any event, the diverse effects of endogenous CO derived from heme degradation on cellular signaling pathways in various cell types warrant further investigation. In summary, here we provide convincing evidence to support the essential role of HO-1 in the anti-inflammatory function of 15d-PGJ2 at low submicromolar concentrations. NF-κB appears to be one of the important targets for the action of HO/CO, although further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Here, we demonstrate that human CNTF cannot directly induce a heterodimer of human gp130 and LIFR. However, human CNTF can use both the membrane-bound and the soluble human IL-6R as a substitute for its cognate α-receptor and thus widen the target spectrum of human CNTF.

Cellular responses to CNTF and IL-6 type cytokines are elicited by different multiunit receptor complexes that always include the membrane-spanning 130-kDa glycoprotein, gp130 (3Grötzinger J.

CNTF first binds in a 1:1 stoichiometry to the GPI-anchored CNTF receptor (CNTFRα), which is not involved in signal transduction (7Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Ip N.Y. Stahl N. Scherer S. Farruggella T.

Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Google Scholar). Binding of CNTF to the membrane-bound or soluble CNTFRα induces a heterodimer of the signal transducing β-receptors gp130 and LIF receptor (LIFR), which triggers intracellular signaling cascades. Similar to CNTF, CT-1 and CLC bind to α-receptors before inducing a gp130/LIFR heterodimer (9Elson G.C. Lelievre E. Guillet C. Chevalier S. Plun-Favreau H. Froger J. Suard I. de Coignac A.B.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4855-4863Google Scholar), whereas LIF and OSM directly induce a gp130/LIFR heterodimer (11Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Google Scholar). OSM may also signal via a second heterodimer of gp130 and the OSM receptor (12Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Google Scholar). In contrast to the aforementioned cytokines, IL-6 and IL-11 induce a gp130 homodimer after binding to specific α-receptors, the IL-6Rα and the IL-11Rα (3Grötzinger J. Kernebeck T. Kallen K.J. Rose-John S. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 803-813Google Scholar). The bewildering variety of receptor complexes of the IL-6 family, however, funnels into activation of an only limited number of intracellular signaling cascades including the JAK/STAT, Ras/MAP kinase, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (6Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Google Scholar, 13Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Google Scholar).The expression of CNTF is restricted to Schwann cells in the peripheral and astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) (14Stockli K.A. Lillien L.E.

Nature. 1988; 335: 70-73Google Scholar), CNTF is primarily considered as a lesion factor because of the lack of a signal peptide in the CNTF gene and its immunohistochemically determined cytosolic localization (1Stockli K.A. Lottspeich F. Sendtner M. Masiakowski P. Carroll P. Gotz R. Lindholm D. Thoenen H. Nature. 1989; 342: 920-923Google Scholar). Several studies showed that CNTF prevents degeneration of axotomized peripheral motor neurons and also retrograde cell death of neurons in thalamic nuclei after dissection of intracerebral neuronal circuits (17Sendtner M. Kreutzberg G.W. Thoenen H. Nature. 1990; 345: 440-441Google Scholar, 18Clatterbuck R.E. Price D.L. Koliatsos V.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2222-2226Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal implantation of a CNTF-producing cell line improved survival in a mouse model of motor neuropathy (19Sendtner M. Schmalbruch H. Stockli K.A. Carroll P. Kreutzberg G.W. Thoenen H. Nature. 1992; 358: 502-504Google Scholar), and in different models of Huntington′s disease, CNTF exerted a neuroprotective effect on striatal cells (20Anderson K.D. Panayotatos N. Corcoran T.L.

On denervated rat skeletal muscles, CNTF reduced denervation-induced atrophy and increased muscular strength (29Helgren M.E. Squinto S.P. Davis H.L. Parry D.J. Boulton T.G. Heck C.S. Zhu Y.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1257-1262Google Scholar).CNTF knock-out (−/−) mice display a mild phenotype showing progressive loss of motor neurons and reduced muscular strength only in the adult, not in childhood (31Masu Y. Wolf E. Holtmann B. Sendtner M. Brem G. Thoenen H. Nature. 1993; 365: 27-32Google Scholar). Cross-breeding of CNTF−/− mice with LIF−/− mice resulted in a much more prominent phenotype, suggesting that LIF also exerts a physiological neurotrophic effect (32Sendtner M. Gotz R. Holtmann B. Escary J.L. Masu Y. Carroll P. Wolf E. Brem G. Brulet P. Thoenen H. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 686-694Google Scholar). In contrast to CNTF−/− mice, CNTFR−/− mice died within 24 h postnatally because of a suckling defect caused by severe motor neuron deficits (33DeChiara T.M. Vejsada R. Poueymirou W.T. Acheson A. Suri C. Conover J.C. Friedman B. McClain J. Pan L. Stahl N. Cell. 1995; 83: 313-322Google Scholar). This indicated the existence of a second ligand for the CNTFR. Surprisingly, the knock-out of an orphan receptor, NR6, resulted in a phenotype almost identical to that of CNTFR−/− mice (34Alexander W.S. Rakar S. Robb L. Farley A. Willson T.A. Zhang J.G. Hartley L. Kikuchi Y. Kojima T. Nomura H. Hasegawa M. Maeda M. Fabri L. Jachno K. Nash A. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 605-608Google Scholar). This enigma was resolved by the discovery, that CLC is the second ligand to the CNTFR and that NR6 is identical to another orphan receptor, CLF, which is essential for transport to the cell surface and secretion of CLC (9Elson G.C. Lelievre E. Guillet C. Chevalier S. Plun-Favreau H. Froger J. Suard I. de Coignac A.B. Delneste Y. Bonnefoy J.Y. Gauchat J.F. Gascan H. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 867-872Google Scholar, 35Elson G.C.

Yokoji H. Misawa H. Hayashi M. Hu J. Deguchi T. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 79-84Google Scholar). However, recent studies strongly suggest that the absence of CNTF modifies the course of some important neurological diseases. Postmortem spinal cord samples from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) showed decreased levels of CNTF (38Anand P. Parrett A. Martin J. Zeman S. Foley P. Swash M. Leigh P.N. Cedarbaum J.M. Lindsay R.M. Williams Chestnut R.E. Sinicropi D.V. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 168-172Google Scholar), and in patients with ALS due to a mutation of the superoxide dismutase gene, CNTF deficiency was associated with an earlier onset and a more severe course of the disease (39Giess R. Holtmann B. Braga M. Grimm T. Muller-Myhsok B. Toyka K.V. Sendtner M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 1277-1286Google Scholar). CNTF-deficient patients also displayed a significantly earlier onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) and more severe symptoms (40Giess R. Maurer M. Linker R. Gold R. Warmuth-Metz M. Toyka K.V. Sendtner M. Rieckmann P. Arch. Neurol. 2002; 59: 407-409Google Scholar). Apparently, CNTF exerts a protective effect in demyelinating disease by preventing apoptosis of oligodendrocytes (41Linker R.A. Maurer M. Gaupp S. Martini R. Holtmann B. Giess R. Rieckmann P. Lassmann H. Toyka K.V. Sendtner M. Gold R. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 620-624Google Scholar). CNTF also exerts an anti-inflammatory effect in the central nervous system by inhibition of TNFα production and activation of the hypothalamic pituitary axis (42Meazza C. Di Marco A. Fruscella P. Gloaguen I. Laufer R. Sironi M. Sipe J.D. Villa P. Romano M. Ghezzi P. Neuroimmunomodulation. 1997; 4: 271-276Google Scholar). The association of CNTF deficiency with clinically more severe MS in humans is all the more surprising, since a model disease of MS in mice, experimental autoimmune encephalitis, cannot be elicited in IL-6−/−mice (43Okuda Y. Sakoda S. Bernard C.C. Fujimura H. Saeki Y. Kishimoto T. Yanagihara T. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 703-708Google Scholar, 44Eugster H.P. Frei K. Kopf M. Lassmann H. Fontana A. Eur. J.

Anderson K.D. Sleeman M.W. Wong V. Tan J. Hijarunguru A. Corcoran T.L. Murray J.D. Thabet K.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 6456-6461Google Scholar). At concentrations sufficient for weight reduction, no intolerable side effects occurred. It was suggested that CNTF could therefore be the basis for new strategies to combat human obesity provided the chemical structure of CNTF could be redesigned to reduce or eliminate side effects (49Kalra S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 4279-4281Google Scholar). In a toxicity trial of CNTF in humans, cachexia, aseptical meningitis, reactivation of virus infections, and respiratory failure were observed at high doses (>5 μg/kg/day) after subcutaneous injection of CNTF (50Miller R.G. Bryan W.W. Dietz M.A. Munsat T.L. Petajan J.H. Smith S.A. Goodpasture J.C. Neurology. 1996; 47: 1329-1331Google Scholar). In a placebo-controlled trial of CNTF in patients with ALS, the dosage was therefore limited to 5 μg/kg/day, where, however, no beneficial clinical effects were observed compared with placebo (51Miller R.G. Petajan J.H. Bryan W.W. Armon C. Barohn R.J. Goodpasture J.C. Hoagland R.J. Parry G.J. Ross M.A. Stromatt S.C. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 256-260Google Scholar).In experiments with human HepG2 hepatoma cells, rat CNTF, which has an 85% amino acid identity to human CNTF, induced expression of acute phase proteins (52Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Roeb E. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 280-284Google Scholar, 53Baumann H. Ziegler S.F. Mosley B. Morella K.K. Pajovic S. Gearing D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8414-8417Google Scholar). It was explicitly shown that the rat CNTF activity on human HepG2 cells was not relayed via the human IL-6R (52Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Roeb E. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 280-284Google Scholar), although apparently, rat CNTF stimulates the acute phase response on primary hepatocytes after binding to the rat IL-6R (54Nesbitt J.E. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 544-550Google Scholar). At high concentrations, rat CNTF induces an active heterodimer of human gp130 and human LIFR even in the absence of the CNTFRα (11Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Google Scholar). We have recently observed activity of recombinant human CNTF at high concentrations on HepG2 cells, which do not express the CNTFR (53Baumann H. Ziegler S.F. Mosley B. Morella K.K. Pajovic S. Gearing D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8414-8417Google Scholar), but did not observe a similar effect on murine BaF/3 cells stably transfected with human gp130 and human LIFR. The discrepancy prompted the present study, which demonstrates that in contrast to rat CNTF, human CNTF is unable to elicit a heterodimer of human gp130 and LIFR in the absence of an α-receptor. However, the human IL-6R can serve as a substitute α-receptor for human CNTF in the assembly of a functional receptor complex. Molecular modeling revealed the molecular basis for the difference between human and rat CNTF in binding to the human IL-6R.RESULTSMurine BaF/3-cells do not express IL-6-type cytokine receptors, but proliferate in response to human IL-6 type cytokines upon transfection of appropriate human receptors. To analyze the interaction of human CNTF with different receptors of the IL-6 family, we made use of a set of murine BaF/3 cells stably transfected with different combinations of human IL-6-type receptors (Fig.1). gp130 and LIFR are expressed at equal levels in these cell lines (55Kallen K.-J. Grötzinger J. Lelièvre E. Vollmer P. Aasland D. Renné C. Müllberg J. Meyer zum Büschenfelde K.-H. Gascan H. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11859-11867Google Scholar). Human CNTF-stimulated proliferation of BaF/3-cells stably transfected with gp130, LIFR, and CNTFR (Fig.1 A), but even at very high concentrations up to 10 μg/ml, it was inactive on BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR] cells that do not express the CNTFR (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the CNTFR is an absolute requirement for activity of human CNTF. Similarly, CNTF was inactive on BaF/3-[gp130,IL-6R] cells, which lack the LIFR and the CNTFR (Fig.1 C). Unexpectedly, however, CNTF showed activity on BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR,IL-6R] cells that expressed the human IL-6R instead of the CNTFR (Fig. 1 D). Maximal activity of CNTF was achieved at concentrations exceeding 250 ng/ml, but a clear effect of CNTF was already discernible at 10 ng/ml. LIF, IL-6, and the designer cytokine IC7, which induces a gp130/LIFR heterodimer after binding to the IL-6R (55Kallen K.-J. Grötzinger J. Lelièvre E. Vollmer P. Aasland D. Renné C. Müllberg J. Meyer zum Büschenfelde K.-H. Gascan H. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11859-11867Google Scholar), stimulated proliferation with ED50 of 0.6, 0.9, and 0.5 ng/ml, whereas an about 42-fold higher CNTF concentration (ED50 = 30 ng/ml) was required for the same stimulatory effect.To further substantiate binding of CNTF to the IL-6R, we tested the ability of the neutralizing anti-human IL-6R antibody PM-1 to block binding of CNTF to the IL-6R. PM-1 binds to the cytokine binding epitope of the IL-6R and thus inhibits binding of IL-6 to its cognate α-receptor (56Sato K. Tsuchiya M. Saldanha J. Koishihara Y. Ohsugi Y. Kishimoto T. Bendig M.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 851-856Google Scholar). PM-1 did not inhibit LIF-induced proliferation of BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR,IL-6R] cells (Fig.2 A), nor phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by LIF (Fig. 3,A and B). In contrast, there was a clear competitive inhibition of BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR,IL-6R] cell proliferation by PM-1 after stimulation with IL-6, IC7 and importantly also CNTF (Fig. 2, B–D). Consistent with the competitive inhibition by PM-1 of IL-6, IC7- and CNTF-dependent proliferation of BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR,IL-6R] cells, phosphorylation of STAT3 after stimulation with CNTF was almost completely inhibited by PM-1 (Fig. 3,A and B). Phosphorylation of STAT3 in BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR,IL-6R] cells was also inhibited by PM-1 after stimulation with 50 ng/ml IL-6 or IC7, but not after stimulation with LIF. The inhibitory effect of PM-1 on CNTF-induced proliferation of BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR,IL-6R] cells, however, was abolished when these cells were stimulated by the combination of CNTF and the soluble CNTFR (Fig. 2 D), demonstrating that inhibition of CNTF activity by PM-1 on BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR,IL-6R] cells was specific for interaction of CNTF with the IL-6R.Figure 2The anti-IL-6R antibody PM-1 inhibits the proliferative effect of CNTF on BaF/3-[gp130/LIFR/IL-6R] cells.BaF/3-[gp130/LIFR/IL-6R]-cells were stimulated with LIF (A), IL-6 (B), IC7 (C), and CNTF (D) in the absence (gray bars) or presence (black bars) of the neutralizing monoclonal anti-human IL-6R antibody PM-1 (10 μg/ml). In D, cells were also treated with CNTF plus sCNTFR (250 ng/ml) in the absence (open bars) or presence (hatched bars) of PM-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3The anti-IL-6R antibody PM-1 inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation after CNTF stimulation of BaF/3-[gp130/LIFR/IL-6R] cells.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11859-11867Google Scholar) have shown, that CNTF is biologically active on HepG2 cells at high concentrations, we wanted to ascertain whether this effect also depended on binding of CNTF to the IL-6R. We therefore stimulated HepG2 cells with increasing amounts of IL-6 and CNTF as well as OSM, which, like LIF, does not require binding to an α-receptor to induce phosphorylation of STAT3 via a gp130/LIFR or gp130/OSMR heterodimer. Similar to our results with BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR,IL-6R] cells, PM-1 competitively inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 after stimulation with IL-6 and CNTF, but had no effect on the cellular response to OSM (Fig.4, A and B).Figure 4The IL-6R mediates the activity of human CNTF on human HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were stimulated for 10 min with human OSM (50 ng/ml) or varying concentrations of IL-6 and CNTF in the absence (A) or presence of (B) of the neutralizing monoclonal anti-human IL-6R antibody PM-1 (10 μg/ml). The PM-1 was added to the supernatant 1 h before stimulation with the cytokines. Cells were lysed, and the lysate subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phosphorylation of STAT3 was ascertained with anti-STAT3 P. Equal loading was checked with an anti-β-actin antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next wanted to analyze whether the ability of CNTF to induce cellular responses via binding to the membrane-bound IL-6R also pertained to the soluble IL-6R. Maximal proliferative responses of BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR] cells to the combination IL-6/soluble IL-6R were achieved with concentrations of sIL-6R exceeding 80 ng/ml (Fig.5 A). BaF/3-[gp130,LIFR] cells were therefore stimulated with CNTF at concentrations of up to 1 μg/ml in the presence of 100 or 500 ng/ml sIL-6R (Fig.5 C). As in the previous experiments, maximal responses to CNTF, which were similar to those observed after 50 ng/ml LIF (Fig.5 B), were observed at around 250 ng/ml CNTF. A marked proliferative response was already discernible at 50 ng/ml CNTF. There was no difference between cellular responses to CNTF in the presence of 100 and 500 ng of sIL-6R.Figure 5Human CNTF interacts with the soluble human IL-6R to stimulate BaF/3-[gp130/LIFR] cells.

Open bars, 100 ng/ml sIL-6R;closed bars, 500 ng/ml IL-6R.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To demonstrate direct interaction between CNTF and the IL-6R, CNTF was incubated with IL-6R-Fc, a recently constructed fusion protein of the IL-6R and the Fc part of human IgG1, in the presence of 1% Brij 96 (57). Following precipitation with protein A-Sepharose and SDS-PAGE, CNTF could be detected in the precipitate with a Western blot against human CNTF (Fig. 6, lanes 4–7). IL-6R-Fc alone did not react in the Western blot (lane 2). The polyclonal antibody specifically detected CNTF (lane 1) and did not cross-react with human IL-6 (lane 3). To quantify real-time binding of IL-6 and CNTF to the IL-6R, IL-6R-Fc was immobilized to a IASYSTM cuvette, and the association and dissociation rates for binding of CNTF and IL-6 to IL-6R-Fc determined (Fig. 7, Aand B). A K D of 184 nm was measured for binding of IL-6 (k on = 3.71 × 104m−1 s−1,k off = 6.83 × 10−3s−1), whereas the K D for CNTF was 9.0 μm (k on = 2.68 × 102m−1 s−1,k off = 2.44 × 10−3s−1). For comparison, the reported dissociation constants for IL-6 binding to the complete IL-6R (64Weiergräber O. Hemmann U. Kuster A. Müller-Newen G. Schneider J. Rose-John S. Kurschat P.

These results suggest that the 42-fold difference in CNTF activity after binding to the IL-6R compared with IL-6 and IC7 (Fig. 1 D) most probably reflects the roughly 50-fold lower affinity of human CNTF binding to the human IL-6R.Figure 6Precipitation of human CNTF by human IL-6R-Fc.

The x-ray structure of the human CNTF and a model of the human IL-6/ILR-6 complex were used as templates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The human IL-6R is bound to site I of human CNTF, and therefore we analyzed which amino acid residues involved in the interacting epitope are conserved in human and rat CNTF. Interestingly, we found that only one residue, Gln-63 in human CNTF, is replaced by an arginine in the rat molecule. Fig. 8 B shows a magnified view of the interaction area between the two human molecules. Gln-63 is deeply buried in the interface, closely surrounded by amino acid side chains from the CNTF (Asp-62, Trp-64, His-174) and IL-6R (Pro-126, Leu-127, Tyr-188, Ser-246, Phe-248, Gln-300). The fact that rat CNTF does not bind to the human IL-6R, therefore, results from the central involvement of the Gln-63 side chain in the binding interface between CNTF and the IL-6R. Compared with Gln, the side chain of arginine is substantially more extended"
https://openalex.org/W2074417648,"Excessive free fatty acid (FFA) exposure represents a potentially important diabetogenic condition that can impair insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. Because mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is a main link between glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, in the present work we investigated the effects of the FFA oleate (OE) on mitochondrial function in the clonal pancreatic β-cell line, MIN6. Both the long term (72 h) and short term (immediately after application) impact of OE exposure on β-cells was investigated. After 72 h of exposure to OE (0.4 mm, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) cells were washed and permeabilized, and mitochondrial function (respiration, phosphorylation, membrane potential formation, production of reactive oxygen species) was measured in the absence or presence of OE. MIN6 cells exposed to OE for 72 h showed impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and decreased cellular ATP. Mitochondria in OE-exposed cells retained normal functional characteristics in FFA-free medium; however, they were significantly more sensitive to the acute uncoupling effect of OE treatment. The mitochondria of OE-exposed cells displayed increased depolarization caused by acute OE treatment, which is attributable to the elevation in the FFA-transporting function of uncoupling protein 2 and the dicarboxylate carrier. These cells also had an increased production of reactive oxygen species in complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that could be activated by FFA. A high level of reduction of respiratory complex I augmented acute FFA-induced uncoupling in a way compatible with activation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein by intramitochondrial superoxide. A stronger augmentation was observed in OE-exposed cells. Together, these events may underlie FFA-induced depression of the ATP/ADP ratio in β-cells, which accounts for the defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion associated with lipotoxicity.

Chronic elevation of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) 1The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acid; OE, oleate; UCP, uncoupling protein; DIC, dicarboxylate carrier; SOD, superoxide dismutase; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; ROS, reactive oxygen species; BSA, bovine serum albumin; KRB, Krebs-Ringer buffer; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBS-T, TBS-Tween.1The abbreviations used are: FFA, free fatty acid; OE, oleate; UCP, uncoupling protein; DIC, dicarboxylate carrier; SOD, superoxide dismutase; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; ROS, reactive oxygen species; BSA, bovine serum albumin; KRB, Krebs-Ringer buffer; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBS-T, TBS-Tween. is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Long term exposure of insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells to elevated concentrations of FFAs alters glucose-induced insulin secretion and is considered as an important factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes (1Lameloise N.

In pancreatic β-cells, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is a crucial intermediate between glucose metabolism and insulin secretion (4Langin D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 1772-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Antinozzi P.A. Ishihara H. Newgard C.B. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11746-11755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and thus the effect of fatty acids on the functional state of mitochondria in this cell type is an important area of investigation. Previous work demonstrated that fatty acids applied for 48–72 h cause partial uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content and increased respiration) (1Lameloise N. Muzzin P. Prentki M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Carlsson C. Borg L.A. Welsh N. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3422-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although fatty acids are natural weak uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, a direct uncoupling effect of fatty acids on β-cell mitochondria was considered as unlikely since these effects were observed after long term (48–72 h) but not short term (15 min–2 h) application (1Lameloise N. Muzzin P. Prentki M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Carlsson C. Borg L.A. Welsh N. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3422-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, alteration in activity and/or expression of certain mitochondrial enzymes and transporters was suggested as the most likely cause of the fatty acid effect on oxidative phosphorylation in β-cells (7Segall L. Lameloise N. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Roche E. Corkey P. Thumelin S. Corkey B.E. Prentki M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E521-E528PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, it was suggested that the lowered mitochondrial membrane potential and impaired glucose-induced rise in the ATP/ADP ratio in FFA-exposed β-cells are caused by induction of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in mitochondria (1Lameloise N. Muzzin P. Prentki M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Indeed, FFA exposure leads to elevated levels of UCP2 mRNA and protein in β-cell mitochondria (1Lameloise N. Muzzin P. Prentki M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 8Medvedev A.V. Robidoux J. Bai X. Cao W. Floering L.M. Daniel K.W. Collins S. J. Biol.

However, it is not clear if this can account entirely for alterations in mitochondrial function. In fact, the uncoupling (protonophoric) function of UCP2 and UCP3 is still a subject of debate (9Cadenas S. Echtay K.S. Harper J.A. Jekabsons M.B. Buckingham J.A. Grau E. Abuin A. Chapman H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18633-18639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence to suggest that the two functions of UCPs are to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and to export FFA anions from mitochondria, rather than to provide basal proton conductance of the mitochondrial membrane (12Li L.X. Skorpen F. Egeberg K. Jorgensen I.H. Grill V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Himms-Hagen J. Harper M.E. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood.). 2001; 226: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanism of the effect of fatty acid in the present study we applied permeabilized cell techniques to assess mitochondrial function in the β-cell and the effects of the long term (72 h) and short term (immediately after FFA addition to the assay medium) application of FFA. Studying intact cells provides only limited information about mitochondrial function because it is difficult to control the extramitochondrial medium and the mitochondrial functional state (14Bogucka K.

Tiivel T. Tranqui L. Olivares J. Winkler K. Wiedemann F. Kunz W.S. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 184: 81-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Permeabilization of the plasma membrane for low molecular weight solutes allows the investigation of mitochondrial processes under precisely controlled conditions in situ, where mitochondrial interaction with intracellular structures is largely preserved. To obtain sufficient amounts of uniform material, which is required for this kind of study, we used the pancreatic β-cell line, MIN6. This cell line is one of the few that retains insulin-secretory responses to glucose and other secretagogues and has been used extensively in studies on the mechanisms controlling insulin secretion (16Soejima A. Inoue K. Takai D. Kaneko M. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Hayashi J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Minami K. Yano H. Miki T.

Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.I. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In the present study, it was found that long term exposure of MIN6 cells to oleate (OE) sensitizes mitochondria to its direct uncoupling (acute) action. Another result of the long term OE application was stimulation of mitochondrial ROS production, mostly accounted for by the activity of complex I of the respiratory chain. In turn, the high level of reduction of complex I was accompanied by an additional uncoupling effect (mitochondrial depolarization), which was more pronounced in the OE-exposed cells. Dependence of this depolarization on the presence of FFA in the assay medium, GDP, inhibitors of complex I and a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic suggests that it was caused by activation of UCP2 (the only UCP found in pancreatic β-cells) with intramitochondrial superoxide. These findings are of interest in light of continuing debate on UCPs potential functions (9Cadenas S. Echtay K.S. Harper J.A. Jekabsons M.B. Buckingham J.A. Grau E. Abuin A. Chapman H. Clapham J.C.

In addition, OE-induced mitochondrial depolarization was sensitive to the dicarboxylate carrier (DIC) substrate malonate and OE-exposed cells demonstrated an elevated level of this carrier. Together these observations suggest that an increase in OE uncoupling efficiency caused by the long term incubation with OE is associated with a FFA-transporting function of the mitochondrial inner membrane proteins UCP2 and DIC. Growth, Fatty Acid Treatment, and Permeabilization of Cells—MIN6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.05 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 3–4 days. For fatty acid exposure, growth medium was changed to Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI 1640) medium containing the ingredients listed above in addition to 0.4 mm OE bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) (0.5% BSA for control experiments). After 72 h of incubation, with daily medium change, trypsinized cells were washed in Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB buffer, 120 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and permeabilized essentially as described by Civelek et al. (21Civelek V.N. Deeney J.T. Shalosky N.J. Tornheim K. Hansford R.G. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from two 10-cm dishes were suspended in 0.7 ml of KRB buffer containing 80 μg/ml saponin. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed in cold buffer, and suspended in cold 0.25 m sucrose containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. This produced stable cell preparations that retained permeable plasma membranes and coupled mitochondria when stored overnight at 4 °C or for at least 2 months at –80 °C. Insulin Secretion Assay—MIN6 cells cultured in 12- or 24-well plates after OE exposure as described above were washed and preincubated twice for 30 min in a modified KRB (115 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm KCl, 2.5 mMCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) with 0.1% BSA, then incubated for 1 h in the same buffer containing 1.25–25 mm glucose similar to a previous report (22Chan C.B. De Leo D. Joseph J.W. McQuaid T.S. Ha X.F. Xu F. Tsushima R.G. Pennefather P.S. Salapatek A.M. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Insulin secretion in response to glucose was quantified using a radio-immunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) according to manufacturer's instruction and normalized by cellular protein content. Respiration Measurements—Oxygen consumption by permeabilized MIN6 cells was measured using a Clark-type electrode connected to an Oxygraph unit (Hansatech, Pentney, England). Cells were suspended at a concentration of 0.6–0.9 mg of protein/ml in incubation medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm Pi, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.2% BSA. 10 mm succinate, 5 mm glutamate/5 mm malate or 7.5 mm glycerol-3-phosphate were added as respiratory substrates. Oxygen kinetic traces were treated as described by Estabrook (23Estabrook R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 41-47Crossref Scopus (1893) Google Scholar), and respiration rates were converted into molar oxygen units using O2 solubility in sucrose medium, as reported by Reynafarje et al. (24Reynafarje B. Costa L.E. Lehninger A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Monitoring—Mitchondrial membrane potential was monitored by following safranin O fluorescence in suspensions of permeabilized cells (25Vercesi A.E. Bernardes C.F. Hoffmann M.E. Gadelha F.R. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14431-14434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rhodamine 123 fluorescence in intact cells (1Lameloise N. Muzzin P. Prentki M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Different methods for measurements were due to a superior responsiveness to K+/valinomycin titration by safranin in permeabilized cells and higher loading ability of rhodamine 123 in intact cells. Measurements were performed using a FluoroCount plate reader (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT) with excitation/emission wavelengths of 530/590 nm for safranin and 485/530 nm for rhodamine 123, respectively. A decrease in fluorescence corresponded to an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential. Incubation medium for permeabilized cells was identical to that used for respiratory assays but was supplemented with 2.5 μm safranin. Intact cells were incubated in KRB buffer. The magnitude of the fatty acid-induced depolarization in permeabilized cells was estimated by titration with K+/valinomycin by supplementing the assay medium with 0.7 μm valinomycin and the addition of 0.05–7.4 mm K+. Intact cells were loaded with rhodamine-123 at 10 μg/ml as previously described (22Chan C.B. De Leo D. Joseph J.W. McQuaid T.S. Ha X.F. Xu F. Tsushima R.G. Pennefather P.S. Salapatek A.M.

J. 1993; 294: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the fluorescence response to the addition of glucose and the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) was monitored. ATP Assay—To monitor synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP, samples were withdrawn from the cell suspension at appropriate time points and fixed with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (27Ouhabi R. Boue-Grabot M. Mazat J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ATP was measured using the luciferin-luciferase kit from Sigma according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorometric Determination of Hydrogen Peroxide Production—Generation of ROS was estimated as hydrogen peroxide formation by monitoring catalase-sensitive appearance of dichlorofluorescein (excitation 490 nm, emission 530 nm) from non-fluorescent dichlorofluorescein in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (28Cocco T. Di Paola M. Papa S. Lorusso M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M.

High concentrations (1.55 units/ml) and the low Km of peroxidase helps to circumvent interference from endogenous hydrogen peroxide-metabolizing enzymes (31Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Dichlorofluorescein was obtained from the stable compound dichlorofluorescin diacetate by alkaline hydrolysis. Western Blot for DIC—Whole cell protein extracts from MIN6 cells (40 μg of protein/lane) were separated on 14% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween (TBS-T) for 1 h and incubated with DIC antibody (polyclonal rabbit antibody against mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier, 1:1000 dilution in TBS-T with 0.5% BSA) (32Das K. Lewis R.Y. Combatsiaris T.P. Lin Y. Shapiro L. Charron M.J. Scherer P.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) for 2 h. Blots were washed with TBS-T and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed again with TBS-T and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence using a standard kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Band intensity was measured by densitometry, analyzed using image analysis software (Scion Image v.4.02; Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD) and normalized by cytochrome c content in parallel samples. Statistics—In all cases a Student's t test was used to analyze data between groups. A p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effect of Oleate Exposure on Insulin Secretion—Incubation with 0.4 mm OE for 72 h caused an increase in the basal level of insulin secretion in MIN6 cells, while inhibiting glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 1). These alterations are very similar to those observed in β-cell lines and pancreatic islets by us and others (6Carlsson C. Borg L.A. Welsh N. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3422-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Segall L. Lameloise N. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Roche E. Corkey P. Thumelin S. Corkey B.E. Prentki M. Am. J.

Effect of Oleate on Mitochondrial Function—Permeabilization of the plasma membrane with saponin allows observation of metabolic transitions accompanying oxidative phosphorylation in β-cell mitochondria in situ. Representative oxygen kinetic traces in control and OE-exposed cells (Fig. 2) demonstrate that oxygen consumption in permeabilized cells responds to respiratory substrate, ADP, oligomycin, and FCCP in a way typical for isolated mitochondria (15Saks V.A. Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Kay L. Sikk P. Tiivel T. Tranqui L. Olivares J. Winkler K. Wiedemann F. Kunz W.S. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 184: 81-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Vercesi A.E. Bernardes C.F. Hoffmann M.E. Gadelha F.R. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14431-14434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Occurrence of the state 3-state 4 transition is of interest since in permeabilized cells it is usually prevented by cytosolic ATPases (21Civelek V.N. Deeney J.T. Shalosky N.J. Tornheim K. Hansford R.G. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Ouhabi R. Boue-Grabot M. Mazat J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the rates of ATP synthesis after the addition of ADP. We also measured ATP hydrolysis after the completion of ADP phosphorylation and the inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthase with oligomycin. For these measurements, samples were taken from cell suspensions in the course of the reaction, fixed with Me2SO, and analyzed for ATP with luciferin-luciferase. It was found that succinate-driven ATP synthesis in state 3 in permeabilized MIN6 cells is faster than cytosolic ATP hydrolysis in state 4 by more than an order of magnitude (56.5 ± 4.8 and 3.3 ± 0.6 nmol ATP/min per mg of protein, n = 3). Thus the present experimental conditions allow an estimation of mitochondrial ATP synthesis despite interference of cytosolic enzymes. Mitochondrial respiratory and coupling parameters derived from respiratory kinetic traces suggest apparently normal functional performance of mitochondria in OE-exposed cells (Table I). This is consistent with the observation that mitochondrial membrane potential kinetics in OE-treated cells closely parallels that of control cells (Fig. 3A). Fluorescent kinetics show that quenching of safranin fluorescence is entirely dependent on the addition of succinate, suggesting a mitochondrial origin of the safranin response and low levels of endogenous mitochondrial substrates in permeabilized washed cells. Succinate (or FCCP)-dependent safranin fluorescence quenching ΔFquench/ΔFtotal of 0.647 ± 0.024 and 0.648 ± 0.032 was found for the control and OE-exposed cells, respectively (n = 4).Table IRespiratory rates and coupling parameters in control and oleate-treated permeabilized MIN6 cells (n = 4)State 3 respiration V3,ADPADP/ORespiratory control rationmol O2/min mg of proteinControl cells20.1 ± 2.01.33 ± 0.073.06 ± 0.49Oleate-treated cells18.8 ± 1.41.38 ± 0.043.33 ± 0.39 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Mitochondrial membrane potential formation and breakdown in permeabilized and intact MIN6 cells.A, permeabilized cells (0.7 mg of protein/ml) were placed into respiratory incubation medium (see “Experimental Procedures”) supplemented with 2.5 μm safranin.

Muzzin P. Prentki M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 6Carlsson C. Borg L.A. Welsh N. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3422-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For further verification of our findings, mitochondrial membrane potential was tested in the same cells before permeabilization, as shown in Fig. 3B. Typical kinetic curves demonstrate that FCCP causes a significantly smaller fluorescent response in OE-exposed cells (48 ± 8% of the fluorescent response in control cells, p < 0.05) indicating that mitochondria in OE-treated cells, in the presence of endogenous substrates or external glucose, are partially depolarized. This confirms results of previous work and indicates that mitochondria in β-cells exposed to fatty acids are partly uncoupled when functioning in their native intracellular environment but show normal functional capacity when placed into standard incubation medium (see “Experimental Procedures”). This suggests that mitochondrial uncoupling in β-cells exposed to OE is caused primarily by cytosolic mediators that appear in the cells treated with fatty acid. A natural candidate for such a role would be OE itself, which is well known as a weak mitochondrial uncoupler (34Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we titrated mitochondrial membrane potential in the control and OE-exposed permeabilized MIN6 cells with OE (35Hofmann W.E. Liu X. Bearden C.M. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12460-12465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Simonyan R.A. Jimenez M. Ceddia R.B. Giacobino J.P. Muzzin P. Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Typical titration kinetics (Fig. 4A) and analysis of the data (Fig. 4B) indicate that the mitochondrial potential in OE-exposed cells is more sensitive to the uncoupling effect of OE. Qualitatively similar results were observed when the cells were exposed to an oleate/palmitate mixture (2:1) of the same sum molarity (Fig. 4B). It is known that oxidative phosphorylation is characterized by a steep dependence on the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is confined within a 20–30 mV potential range (37Zoratti M. Pietrobon D. Azzone G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 38Woelders H. van der Velden T. van Dam K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 934: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Calibration of mitochondrial depolarization shown in Fig. 4A demonstrates that fatty acid-induced alterations in membrane depolarization are located in this physiologically important interval. Formation of ROS in Mitochondria—Oxidative stress is considered an important component of disorders related to high levels of FFA (39Cuzzocrea S. Riley D.P. Caputi A.P. Salvemini D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 135-159PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, ROS are thought to contribute significantly to defective β-cell function associated with type 2 diabetes (40Gorogawa S. Kajimoto Y.

We have developed a novel model to assess whether morphological changes resulting from intrinsic fibrinolysis are similar to those previously reported at the lysis front using externally applied lytic agents. Fibrin assembly and fibrinolysis were followed in real-time by confocal microscopy using gold-labeled fibrinogen molecules. An increase in fiber absorbance (30%, p < 0.01) and a decrease in fiber diameter (60%, p < 0.01) due to the ongoing accumulation and packing of fibrin molecules were the most significant detectable features occurring during fibrin assembly. Similar features with a similar magnitude were observed during fibrin dissolution, but in the reverse order and with a 3-fold increase in duration. Then, lysing fibers were progressively transected laterally, and thinner fibers were cleaved at a 2.5-fold faster rate than thicker fibers (p < 0.001). Frayed lysing fibers were seen to interact progressively with adjoining fibers (agglomeration), leading to a 76 and 88% increase in the network pore diameter (p < 0.05) and fiber diameter (p < 0.01), respectively. At the maximum decrease in fiber absorbance (46%, p < 0.05), the network suddenly collapsed with the release of large fragments that gradually vanished. Morphological changes of fibrin that occur during intrinsic fibrinolysis are similar as those observed next to the lysis front, although they are not restricted spatially to the clot/surrounding milieu interface but are observed through the entire clot.

Morphological changes of fibrin that occur during intrinsic fibrinolysis are similar as those observed next to the lysis front, although they are not restricted spatially to the clot/surrounding milieu interface but are observed through the entire clot. A wide variety of studies of fibrinolysis have been carried out, but most of them have utilized the same basic model of adding fibrinolytic enzymes to a pre-formed clot. This approach is very important clinically, because removal of the fibrin matrix from occlusive thrombi using externally applied lytic agents is the major goal of pharmacological thrombolysis to achieve vessel patency (1Diamond S.L. Anand S. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 2622-2643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2Diamond S.L. Annu. Rev. Biomed.

However, without external administration of lytic agents, common events in the vasculature that trigger clotting also initiate fibrinolysis at the same time, which is called intrinsic or internal fibrinolysis. Thus, fibrin formation and fibrinolysis usually occur simultaneously. However, this dynamic system is more difficult to simulate in vitro, and only a few studies have been carried out by mixing fibrinogen, plasminogen, and tPA 1The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; rtPA, recombinant tPA.1The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; rtPA, recombinant tPA. with thrombin and using turbidity to follow clot formation and lysis (5Suenson E.

Recent structural studies of fibrinolysis have focused on the diffusional transport of fibrinolytic agents and have given us a good picture of events that occur at the lysis front. The lysis front is a very dynamic region, with movement of partially lysed fiber ends and greatly increased binding of plasminogen and tPA (8Sakharov D.V. Nagelkerke J.F. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2133-2138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Veklich Y. Francis C.W. White J. Weisel J.W.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 4721-4729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Individual fibers are generally cut across laterally rather than by progressive cleavage uniformly around the fiber. In addition, thin fibers were found to be cleaved at a significantly faster rate than thick fibers. Interestingly, the lysis front velocity of plasma cross-linked fibrin clots made of thin fibers organized in a tight network was always found to be slower than that of clots made of thicker fibers organized in a coarse configuration, whatever the amount of lytic agents (9Veklich Y. Francis C.W. White J. Weisel J.W.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 4721-4729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). However, there is essentially no such dynamic and structural information on the process of intrinsic fibrinolysis, even though it is likely to be the most common physiological mode of fibrinolysis. In the present work, we developed a dynamic approach to investigate simultaneously the morphological features of fibrin formation and fibrin dissolution. For that purpose, fibrinolytic agents were added before the initiation of clotting, therefore simulating the effect of physiological intrinsic fibrinolysis. Our main purposes were to visualize early clot formation and compare morphological changes occurring at the fiber level and the network level resulting from the presence of lytic agents throughout the whole clot with those previously reported at the lysis front when lytic agents are introduced by diffusion. Human thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Unconjugated colloidal gold solution for light microscopy was from British Biocell International (Cardiff, UK). The average particle size was 5 nm, and the particle concentration was 5 ×1013/ml. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) was purchased from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany). Glu-plasminogen was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Calcium chloride was from Sigma. Purified fibrinogen and factor XIII were gifts from O. Gorkun (Chapel Hill, NC). Preparation of Fibrin-rich Clots—To a volume of 0.10 ml of purified fibrinogen (1.3 10–5 m final concentration in 20 mm/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 mol/liter NaCl) was added 5 mm CaCl2 (final concentration), 80 μl of the colloidal gold solution, 10 nm rtPA, and 2 μg/ml Glu-plasminogen. After 1 min of incubation, 10 μl of thrombin from the stock solution was added to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 IU/ml. Mixing and incubation were conducted in polypropylene tubes at room temperature, and the solution was rapidly soaked up into glass microchambers designed for confocal microscopy (10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Clots were cross-linked by adding activated factor XIII (10 μg/ml final concentration) prior to clotting. Laser-scanning Confocal Microscopy—After being filled up, the microchambers were scanned immediately with a LSM 510 interactive laser cytometer (Carl Zeiss) linked to a Zeiss inverted microscope equipped with a 63× water immersion objective using the reflection mode. The selected area of scanning was picked up at random. Scanning was performed every 2 min during a total of 46 min. At each time point, 20 scans were taken 1 μm apart. Optical sections were then projected and combined into one image, generating a two-dimensional projection. A total of 10 fibrin-clots were processed for both microscopy and morphological analysis. Morphological Analyses—Each micrograph was processed with the same algorithm using the Visilog software (V5.03, Noesis, development kit) (11Serra J. Serra J. Image Analysis and Mathematical Morphology: Theoretical Advances. 2. Academic Press, London1988: 110-179Google Scholar, 12Crespo J. Serra J. Schafer R.W.

Nonnenmacher L. Leblond-Missenard V. Delcourt A. Homond A. Binet J.L. Cytometry. 1986; 7: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After normalization of the scale for the gray level (between 0 and 255), a first morphological filter was applied to remove the noise spikes while maintaining the original contrast ratio between fibers and background. A second filter selected the most contrasted areas leading to a binary mask where the fibers are separated from the background of the images, allowing counting and accurate measurements (Fig. 1). Four different morphological parameters were assessed, permitting a dynamic analysis of fibrin assembly and fibrin dissolution. At the fiber level, fiber absorbance (mean OD/pixel) and fiber diameter (μm) were recorded at each time point on the fibrin fiber binary mask. Fiber absorbance reflected the average optical density in the binary mask of the fibers and varied according to the progressive aggregation of new fibrin polymers to a preformed fiber or to the ongoing fibrin dissolution. Fiber diameter was measured on a two-dimensional projection of the optical sections using the distribution of the optical density along a transverse line drawn perpendicular to the long axis of the fiber. Each fiber was given a single measurement on the same spot at each time point. An average of ten measurements (10 fibers) performed on the same micrograph at each time point was considered for further analysis. Measurements at the 2-min time point were performed on thinner two-dimensional projections (5 μm instead of 20 μm) to avoid the effect of shifting of the fiber, which occurred during the early step of fibrin formation. Given the fact that a single fiber can be completely visualized within 5 μm of depth, two fibers were picked up in each projection for the measurement of the fiber diameter. To assess early modifications of the network conformation, the fibrin porosity (in μm) was measured at each time point. For that purpose, the most frequent pore diameter was calculated using a specific morphological algorithm (11Serra J. Serra J. Image Analysis and Mathematical Morphology: Theoretical Advances. 2. Academic Press, London1988: 110-179Google Scholar, 12Crespo J. Serra J. Schafer R.W. Signal Process. 1995; 47: 201-225Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Lesty C. Raphael M. Nonnenmacher L. Leblond-Missenard V. Delcourt A. Homond A. Binet J.L. Cytometry. 1986; 7: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), allowing the distribution of the surface areas of the pores according to their diameters. A pore mask was first obtained as the symmetry of the fiber binary mask. Geometric structures (dodecagons) of increasing diameter were shifted inside the binary mask of the pores (Fig. 1, panel 8c). At each step, the areas in which the dodecagons could not fit were eliminated. The diameter of the dodecagon that eliminated the largest area was chosen as the most frequent pore diameter. Finally, the number of disconnected fiber bundles was recorded at each time point on the fibrin fiber binary mask. This number corresponds to the number of disconnected areas within the whole fibrin network. This parameter was chosen to quantify fibrin formation, during which individual fibers merged, but also to identify and quantify lateral transection of individual fibrin fibers, which occurred during fibrin dissolution (10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). -Effects of Beads on Fibrin Formation—The potential impact of colloidal beads on fibrin assembly was assessed by continuous monitoring of the elastic modulus of fibrin-rich clots using the RM-2 analyzer (Hemodyne, Richmond, VA). The same conditions of clotting were used as above. Beads were replaced by buffer in the controls. Generated Plasmin Activity—The generation of plasmin activity within the clot was monitored with the probe S2251 (Chromogenic, Mölndal, Sweden). Plasmin activity was expressed as optical density and recorded using the same conditions of clotting as above. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed with Stat-View software (Version 5.0, Abacus Concepts, Inc.). Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± S.E., and differences between time points were determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). An α level of.05 was accepted as significant. The present in vitro setting allowed investigation of the dynamics of both the fibrin assembly and the fibrin dissolution of fibrin-rich clots (without platelets). Accurate determination of the morphological properties either at the network level or the fiber level without the fading that usually accompanies a fluorescent signal after extensive scanning was made possible by the use of a rapid confocal microscope in the reflection mode. Fibrin Assembly—Fibrin-rich clots consisted of straight rod-like elements organized in a three-dimensional meshwork (Fig. 1, panels 8a–8c) as reported previously (10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The labeling conditions, under which there were ∼20 fibrinogen molecules per gold particle, did not affect fibrin assembly. Indeed, the addition of colloidal beads prior to clotting had no significant effect on the kinetics of fibrin assembly and fibrin dissolution or on clot properties, as shown by the monitoring of fibrin's mechanical properties (Fig. 2), which is likely the most sensitive measure of fibrin structure/properties. Individually labeled molecules were not visible because structures need to be at least 50 nm in size before they can be detected in this system. Monitoring of the early stages of fibrin assembly was difficult, because fibers were extremely mobile, leading to a fuzzy appearance of the two-dimensional reconstructed micrographs (Fig. 1, panel 2). What appear to be multiple views of the same fiber adjacent to each other probably arise from lateral motion of these fibers that are not yet firmly anchored in a gel. A structured scaffold appeared between 2 and 4 min after the initiation of clotting, and fiber mobility decreased dramatically after this time. As a consequence, fibers became sharper, and observation of fiber ends was a common feature between 4 and 8 min after clotting initiation (Fig. 1, arrowheads). Examination of consecutive sections demonstrated that these features were really fiber ends and not just fibers that passed out of a particular section. Although fibers still appeared thicker and bent, appearing as if a few fibers were fusing into a single one, the average apparent fiber diameter was significantly reduced (33%, p = 0.01) between 2 and 4 min after clotting initiation (Fig. 3A). An increase in fibrin absorbance was a constant feature observed at all time points during fibrin formation (29.7% increase between 2 and 8 min, p < 0.05) (Figs. 1 and 3B), indicating that fibers were becoming thicker via the permanent aggregation of additional protofibrils to already formed or forming fibers. The optical absorbance of fibers as well as the elastic modulus of the whole clot peaked at the 8-min time point, indicating that fibrin formation was completed (Figs. 2 and 3B). A lengthening of existing fibrin stands was observed once these strands had coalesced into a linear structure (Fig. 1, arrowheads). Propagation of the fibers extended until contact was made with another growing fiber. One consequence of the phenomenon of the joining of two fibers into one was a 46% decrease in the number of connected fiber bundles between 4 and 8 min after the initiation of clotting (Fig. 4A). Within the same time interval, additional fibrin fibers also appeared in pores that were unoccupied previously (Fig. 1, arrows). The appearance of new fibers was further supported by the measured decrease of the fibrin network porosity (Fig. 4B). Fibrinolysis—The same major features as those described above for fibrin assembly were observed, although in a different time scale and in the reverse order. The first detectable morphological change was a decrease in optical absorbance of fibers, which culminated before major changes in the network architecture occurred (between the 8- and 15-min time points) (Figs. 3B and 5, panels 8a and 16a). The other remarkable morphological change was a complete dissolution of the thinner fibers (<400 nm of diameter) (Fig. 5, panels 8a and 16a, arrows), which displayed faster lysis rates than the thicker fibers (9.5 ± 1.2 min. versus 21.4 ± 1.9 min, respectively, p < 0.001). Thicker fibers underwent surface erosion without any major detectable modifications in their shape. Generated plasmin underwent an exponential increase just after the completion of fibrin formation (Fig. 1), which was expected from other experimental data on the generation of plasmin by the action of fibrin-bound tPA on plasminogen. Dynamic changes in fiber shape and network conformation were identified later (≥10 min after clotting initiation). Fibers were first progressively transected laterally, giving rise to fuzzy and fragmented clusters of fiber pieces with progressive bending of the whole fiber, which remained attached to the scaffold (Fig. 5, panel 16b). The disaggregation of the fibers led to a significant increase in the average apparent fibrin diameter (88% increase between the 8- and 25-min time points, p = 0.0016) (Fig. 3A). After complete transection occurred, fibers became frayed and splayed into a lace-like mesh, but also trended to merge with adjacent fibers (Fig. 5, panel 16a, arrowheads). These modifications led to a significant increase in the number of disconnected fiber bundles (59% increase between the 8- and 15-min time points, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A), as observed when comparing panel 8b with panel 16b of Fig. 5. At the network level, a progressive augmentation of the pore diameter (76%, p < 0.05) was apparent between the 8- and 25-min time points as a consequence of “fiber agglomeration” or merging (Fig. 4B). This led to the formation of dense, poorly defined areas (Fig. 5, panel 24a). The whole network started to collapse after the maximum decrease of the fiber absorbance was reached (46%, p < 0.05). This resulted in the progressive release of pieces of material into the surrounding milieu (Fig. 5, panel 24b). These big agglomerates displayed an initial high optical density and then retracted very fast into small and very dense particles that vanished within a few minutes, leaving an empty area without visible structures. The addition of factor XIII prior to clotting did not modify the fibrin formation step. Fibrin stabilization delayed the overall fibrinolysis process without any changes in the morphological events (data not shown). Recent structural studies have emphasized that fibrin digestion proceeds locally by transverse cutting across fibers, leading to the progressive disaggregation of the whole fiber structure rather than by progressive cleavage uniformly around the fiber as suggested previously (2Diamond S.L. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 1999; 1: 427-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Veklich Y. Francis C.W. White J. Weisel J.W.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 4721-4729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although thin fibers are cleaved at a much faster rate than thick fibers, the fibrin network configuration and especially the number of fibers per volume have been shown to have a more dramatic impact on the fibrinolysis rate than fiber diameter per se. In particular, a fibrin network made of a high number of thin fibers has been shown to bind rtPA that is diffusing into the clot at a slower rate as compared with a network made of a smaller number of thicker fibrin fibers. These unexpected dynamic and structural differences were observed at the plasma/clot interface (i.e. the lysis front), because lytic agents were introduced at one edge of the clot and diffused into it. In some particular conditions, including high concentrations of rtPA and extremely coarse fibrin configuration, rtPA underwent a convective transport, and fiber digestion was shown to occur simultaneously throughout the whole clot without any individualized lysis front (10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). However, because fiber digestion was fast in these specific conditions, morphological analyses were not possible. In the present study, we have simulated the physiological situation by adding lytic agents prior to the initiation of fibrin assembly and then following fibrin assembly and lysis in real-time. In this case, clotting and lysis were initiated at the same time, and then each proceeded at different time scales. It is important to note that labeling of the fibrinogen molecules before the initiation of coagulation neither affected the morphological aspect of the fibrin clot nor modified its mechanical properties. In addition, rtPA concentration was adjusted so that lysis started after the first 10 min after the initiation of clotting, allowing fibrin to form and stabilize. This study provides the first direct visualization of the dynamic process of some of the early stages of fibrin formation and is consistent with previous investigations using a different approach, i.e. turbidity and light scattering (16Carr M.E. Hermans J. Macromolecules. 1978; 11: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 17Weisel J.W.W. Nagaswami S. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 111-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Although the resolution of the light microscope is not sufficient to detect oligomers or protofibrils, small fibers were readily apparent. Initially, these fibers were fuzzy, indicating that they were very mobile. Hence, each optical section took 0.8 s to collect, indicating that the motion was relatively rapid (0.07 μm/sec). They grew rapidly by addition at their ends until meeting another fiber, at which point the two precursor fibers usually fused. A structured scaffold appeared early in the time sequence, at which point most fiber motion ceased. This is the point commonly known as the gel point, obtained from visual observation. Then, fiber diameters increased dramatically over time as measured by the increase in fiber absorbance, which is consistent with the well known finding from studies of fibrin polymerization using turbidity that the gel point occurs long before the turbidity has risen to any great extent (17Weisel J.W.W. Nagaswami S. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 111-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Great similarities in the dynamic morphological events that occur during fibrin formation and fibrin dissolution were found, although in the reverse chronological order. During fibrin formation, protofibrils and small fibers agglomerate to make fibers that are sharper, straight, rod-like elements, with a progressive decrease in fiber diameter. In contrast, during fibrinolysis, the fibers become progressively disaggregated so that they are more diffuse and more curved. Interestingly, these same events occur at the lysis front, so that it appears that the process is much the same regardless of the mode of transport of the lytic agents (9Veklich Y. Francis C.W. White J. Weisel J.W.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 4721-4729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

A constant increase of the fiber optical density is observed throughout fibrin formation, which indicates a persistent aggregation of fibrin molecules even after the network formation is completed, whereas a drop of fiber absorbance is the first detectable feature observed after the initiation of fibrinolysis using either diffusion or pressure-driven permeation of lytic agents (10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the previous reported differences in the rate of fiber digestion according to the fiber diameter (10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) are also observed when rtPA is added prior to the initiation of fibrin assembly. In particular, thin fibrin fibers are formed, extend, and are digested at a faster rate than thicker fibers. Finally, we report a similar cascade of morphological events at the fiber level as described next to the lysis front (10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These findings confirm that fibrin digestion proceeds locally by lateral transection rather than progressive cleavage uniformly around the fiber, irrespective of the mode of transport of the fibrinolytic agents. One of the major dissimilarities between intrinsic fibrinolysis and the diffusion or pressure-driven permeation of lytic agents studied previously is that no release of individual fiber pieces was observed in the present experimental setting. Thin fibers vanished very quickly, giving rise to fibrin degradation products that can easily diffuse, whereas thick fibers trended to aggregate and agglomerate with adjacent fibers. Release of the cleaved pieces of fiber is less likely during intrinsic lysis because there is no lysis front; thus, the cleaved pieces cannot escape and instead become stuck onto adjacent fibers. Aggregation of lysing fibers has been shown to be critical for accelerating fibrinolysis (5Suenson E. Lutzen O. Thorsen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 149: 193-200Google Scholar, 9Veklich Y. Francis C.W.

Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but to date it has not been very apparent next to the lysis front (10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The present study confirms that agglomeration dramatically promotes fibrinolysis, probably by facilitating the crawling of plasmin across agglomerated fibrin as suggested previously (15Weisel J.W. Veklich Y. Collet J.P. Francis C.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Agglomeration of the fibers also promotes the progressive retraction of the whole network, which later collapses into big particles. Although thicker fibers are more likely to undergo agglomeration than thinner fibers, no definite conclusion can yet be drawn on whether the fibrin architecture itself modulates the fibrinolysis rate, as was reported previously in the diffusion model (10Collet J.P. Park D. Lesty C. Soria J. Soria C. Montalescot G. Weisel J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The present study was conducted in specific conditions and represents a more complex model system. In particular, the kinetics of fibrin formation directly affects the fibrinolysis rate irrespective of the specific effect of fibrin conformation on fibrinolysis. This is because rtPA is present during fibrin assembly so that lysis can begin at any time. For example, a coarse fibrin network is obtained when lowering the thrombin concentration, which slows down the rate of fibrinopeptide cleavage so that fibrin monomer formation is slow with respect to lateral aggregation. As a consequence of the slower fibrin polymerization, fibrinolysis is initiated before completion of fibrin assembly (6Carr M.E. Alving B.M. Blood Coagul.

In conclusion, the present findings suggest that intrinsic fibrinolysis leads to the same morphological changes of the fibrin architecture as observed during fibrin formation but also next to the lysis front during diffusion of lytic agents. It is likely that both types of fibrinolysis are occurring simultaneously in vivo, because thrombolysis occurs in the presence of continued coagulation."
https://openalex.org/W1995462531,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of the TNF superfamily, induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells with little or no effect on normal cells. Human hepatoma cells, however, are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Since interferon-α (IFN-α) is capable of enhancing TNF-α-induced apoptosis in certain cancer cells, we evaluated the effect of IFN-α on TRAIL-induced apoptosis of human hepatoma cells. IFN-α pretreatment enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HuH-7 and Hep3B cells, in which IFN-α upregulated the expression of DR5, a death receptor of TRAIL, and downregulated the expression of survivin, which has an antiapoptotic function. In contrast, IFN-α did not enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells, in which expression of DR5 and survivin was not affected by IFN-α. On the other hand, TRAIL activated NF-κB composed of RelA-p50 heterodimer, a key transcription factor regulating cell survival, in HuH-7 and HepG2 cells. However, IFN-α pretreatment repressed the TRAIL-mediated activation of NF-κB and decreased its transcriptional activity in HuH-7 but not in HepG2 cells. Moreover, IFN-α pretreatment clearly augmented TRAIL-mediated caspase-8 activation in HuH-7 cells. Our results suggest that IFN-α could sensitize certain human hepatoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by stimulating its death signaling and by repressing the survival function in these cells."

Upon binding to the site of DNA strand breakage, PARP-1 is activated, leading to rapid and transient poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins using NAD+ as substrate. To investigate the role of PARP-1 in the p53 response to ionizing radiation in human cells, PARP-1 function was disrupted in wild-type p53 expressing MCF-7 and BJ/TERT cells using two strategies: chemical inhibition with 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline, and trans-dominant inhibition by overexpression of the PARP-1 DNA-binding domain. Although a number of proteins can catalyze poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in addition to PARP-1, we show that PARP-1 is the only detectable active species in BJ/TERT and MCF-7 cells. 1,5-Dihydroxyisoquinoline treatment prior to ionizing radiation delayed and attenuated the induction of two p53-responsive genes, p21 and mdm-2, and led to suppression of the p53-mediated G1-arrest response in MCF-7 and BJ/TERT cells. Trans-dominant inhibition of PARP-1 by overexpression of the PARP-1 DNA-binding domain in MCF-7 cells also led to a delay and attenuation in p21 induction and suppression of the p53-mediated G1 arrest response to ionizing radiation.

This study establishes PARP-1 as a critical regulator of the p53 response to DNA damage. The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays a critical role in the cellular response to DNA damage leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on cell type, culture conditions, and the extent of DNA damage. Loss of the p53-dependent DNA damage response can lead to genomic instability and the survival of cells carrying mutations and carcinogenic lesions thereby contributing to malignancy (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6727) Google Scholar).

Elevated levels of p53 protein are believed to be important to initiate the events that lead to G1 arrest or apoptosis after DNA damage. There is compelling evidence that post-translational modification of p53 is required for its stabilization, as well as for activation of its latent sequence-specific DNA-binding and transactivation functions. Once p53 becomes activated it binds as a tetramer to p53 responsive elements on double stranded DNA consisting of two half-sites (5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-3′) separated by a spacer consisting of 0–13 nucleotides (4el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). The site-specific DNA-binding activity of p53 leads to transcriptional activation of p53 target genes. Covalent modification of p53 has also been shown to regulate its subcellular localization, tetramerization, interaction with other proteins, and degradation. p53 protein is modified in vivo through phosphorylation, acetylation, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation reactions (reviewed in Refs. 2Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar and 5Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The events upstream of p53 activation are complex and not well understood. Several DNA damage sensory molecules are believed to relay the DNA damage signal to p53; each may be involved in the response to one or more types of DNA damage. For example, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase protein is involved in the activation of p53 in response to IR (6Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E.

Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) is an abundant nuclear enzyme that binds to, and is activated by, DNA single and double strand breaks (reviewed in Refs. 9D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 10Shall S. de Murcia G. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 11Herceg Z. Wang Z.Q. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Its activation represents one of the earliest responses to DNA damage in the cell. PARP-1 catalyzes the sequential transfer of ADP-ribose monomers onto nuclear protein acceptors using NAD+ as substrate. During the process of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, NAD+ is hydrolyzed and released as free nicotinamide. More than 30 nuclear proteins have been identified as poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) acceptors, with PARP-1 itself being the major target, via its automodification domain. pADPr acceptor proteins may be modified through covalent as well as through non-covalent association with pADPr, either free or bound to PARP-1. Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase is the major enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of pADPr. There is general agreement, based on genetic and biochemical studies, that PARP-1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic integrity. PARP-1 and p53 have been shown to interact in a number of cell lines including the human leukemia-derived cell line OCI/AML-3 (12Vaziri H. West M.D. Allsopp R.C. Davison T.S. Wu Y.S. Arrowsmith C.H. Poirier G.G. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6018-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The oligomerization and DNA-binding domains of p53 contain copies of the recently characterized pADPr-binding site (13Pleschke J.M. Kleczkowska H.E. Strohm M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40974-40980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pADPr has been shown to interact non-covalently with p53 in vitro (14Malanga M.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2190-2194PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies show that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 can interfere with its site-specific DNA-binding activity (18Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36425-36430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Rosenthal D.S. Luo R.B. Samara R. Jung M.

The ability of PARP-1 to interact with and ADP-ribosylate p53 suggests a functional relationship between these two proteins. An intriguing model is that PARP-1 acts as a DNA damage sensor that regulates p53 function in response to DNA damage. A number of studies have investigated the role of PARP-1 in the p53 response to DNA damage. Several studies indicate that disruption of PARP function by chemical inhibition leads to suppression of p53-dependent transactivation in response to IR (12Vaziri H. West M.D. Allsopp R.C.

Studies using certain PARP-1-deficient mouse cells are confounded by the fact that these cells retain poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity (28Shieh W.M. Ame J.C. Wilson M.V. Wang Z.Q. Koh D.W.

Thus, although PARP-1 plays a clear role in the maintenance of genomic integrity, the functional relationship between PARP-1 and p53 remains unclear. Here we have disrupted PARP-1 function in human cells using two experimental strategies: chemical inhibition with the inhibitor 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (IQ), and trans-dominant inhibition by overexpression of the catalytically inactive DNA-binding domain (DBD) of PARP-1. We have investigated the consequences of PARP-1 disruption on p53-dependent DNA damage response pathways in MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells and in BJ/TERT cells derived from normal human BJ fibroblasts that have been immortalized by ectopic expression of the telomerase enzyme (30Vaziri H. Benchimol S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 279-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). These experiments reveal that inhibition of PARP-1 activity with IQ or with PARP-1 DBD overexpression suppresses the transactivation function of p53 and the ability of p53 to mediate G1 arrest in response to ionizing radiation. This data supports the hypothesis that PARP-1 is a critical regulator of p53 function in response to DNA damage. Cell Culture and Transfection—The BJ/TERT, BJ/TERT-DD, MCF-7, and MCF-7/p53A135V cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. To generate BJ/TERT-DD cells, a 700-bp fragment encoding the C-terminal dimerization domain of p53 was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBabe-neo. The resulting plasmid pBabep53DDneo was cotransfected with pC-Ampho into 293TV cells and the resulting viral supernatants were used to infect BJ/TERT cells. The resulting BJ/TERT-DD cells were subsequently analyzed and shown to lack a p53-dependent G1 checkpoint in response to ionizing radiation. In these cells the overexpressed C-terminal peptide complexes with wild-type p53 protein to form inactive heterotetramers (31Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). MCF-7/p53A135V are MCF-7 cells that stably overexpress the temperature-sensitive p53Val-135 allele (32Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In these cells, the p53 conformation is mutant at 37 °C, and wild-type at 32 °C. For inhibition of PARP activity IQ (Sigma-RBI) was added to the cells 1 h prior to IR. The optimal IQ doses determined by immunofluorescence microscopy were 200 and 350 μm for MCF-7 and BJ/TERT cells, respectively (data not shown). Twenty minutes post-IR, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium and magnesium and incubated with fresh media containing IQ. IQ was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) such that the final concentration of Me2SO to which cells were exposed did not exceed 0.5% (v/v). Cells were irradiated in a 137Cs Gammacell Exactor (Nordion International, Inc.) at a dose rate of ∼1 Gy/min at room temperature. Initially, a dose of 6 Gy was employed for the MCF-7 Western blot analysis; however, we decided to use a dose of 2 Gy for future experiments with MCF-7 and BJ/TERT cells. Both these doses are sufficient to activate the p53-mediated DNA damage response; however, the extent of cell death is less following 2 Gy than 6 Gy in these cell lines (33Vaziri H. Squire J.A.

Cells were washed in PBS, trypsinized, collected, and washed in α-minimal essential medium (without antibiotics or fetal bovine serum), and resuspended in the same media in combination with the appropriate plasmids. Cells were electroporated using a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 250 V, 950 microfarads. For the MCF-7 Western blot analysis, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of pPARP6 plasmid that encodes the PARP-1 DBD (35Kupper J.H. de Murcia G. Burkle A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18721-18724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the control plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) per 5 × 106 cells. To determine the transfection efficiency, cells were transfected with 1 μg of EGFP-NL, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid. For the MCF-7 cell cycle analysis, 5 × 106 cells were transiently co-transfected with 2 μg of pCMVCD20, a plasmid encoding the B-cell marker CD20, and 10 μg of pPARP6 or the control plasmid pcDNA3. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Cells were grown to 75% confluence and washed twice with PBS. Lysis Buffer A (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with Mini-Pill protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics)) was added and the cells were allowed to swell 7 min. Cells were centrifuged at 800 × g and the cytoplasmic fraction decanted. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with lysis Buffer A. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were diluted in 1× loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 6 m urea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol (added fresh) and 1% (w/v) bromphenol blue), sonicated (3 pulses, 15 s each), and heated at 65 °C for 15 min. Activity-Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were resolved by gel electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were soaked at 37 °C in 1× SDS-PAGE running buffer (125 mm Tris base, 960 mm glycine, 0.5% SDS) containing 0.7 m 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The proteins were transferred onto a Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane (APBiotech). After refolding of the membrane-bound proteins in renaturation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Tween), the membranes were incubated in the same buffer supplemented with 2 μg/ml DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA (Sigma), 2 mm Mg2+, 20 μm Zn2+, and 2 μCi/ml [α-32P]NAD. To remove non-covalently bound pADPr, the membranes were washed in renaturation buffer until no radioactivity was detected in the washes. Covalently bound pADPr was detected by autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with PBS, lysed with either SDS loading buffer or SUG buffer (3% SDS (w/v), 6% urea, 10% glycerol, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, with protease inhibitors), collected, and sonicated for 20 s. For the BJ/TERT and BJ/TERT-DD protein analyses, DNA was removed by centrifugation in a Qiashredder column (Qiagen). Protein content of the cell extracts was measured using a modified Lowry assay (Sigma). Following addition of dithiothreitol (100 mm) and bromphenol blue (1% w/v) the protein samples were denatured at 70 °C for 5 min, resolved by gel electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, and transferred by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Primary antibodies against p53 (PAb1801, 1:10 for MCF-7; PAb421, 1:100 for BJ/TERT and BJ/TERT-DD), p21 (1:1000; BD Pharmingen), mdm-2 (2A10, 1:1000), β-actin (1:1000; Sigma), and PARP-1 (C2–10, 1:10,000) were used in conjunction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:2500; Sigma) or anti-sheep secondary antibodies (1:5000; Cedarlane) and the blot visualized using the Renaissance ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the BJ/TERT and BJ/TERT-DD blots, Coomassie Blue stain was used to determine equal loading of protein. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from BJ/TERT and MCF-7 cells using a modified guanidine isothiocyanate method (Trizol, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA content was measured by A260. Twelve μg of each RNA sample was separated on a 1% denaturing agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (APBiotech). The blot was hybridized with 32P-radiolabeled cDNA probes to p21 and GAPDH. Following standard washes, phosphorimage analysis was carried out, and RNA quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Cycle Analysis—To assess the G1 arrest response in MCF-7 and BJ/TERT cells, asynchronously dividing cells were plated on 150-mm tissue culture dishes (MCF-7 at 1 × 106 cells, BJ/TERT at 5 × 105 cells). Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were treated with IQ (MCF-7 at 200 μm, BJ/TERT at 350 μm) and 1 h later irradiated at 2 Gy. Cell cycle distribution was examined by flow cytometry using the propidium iodide (PI) DNA staining method. BJ/TERT and BJ/TERT-DD cells were washed once with PBS and incubated on ice in 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 50 μg/ml PI to release nuclei. Cells were collected and nuclei were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry. For the time course analysis, BJ/TERT cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with PBS containing 0.5% EDTA for 10 min. Cells were scraped into α-minimal essential medium and collected by centrifugation. Following one wash in cold PBS, cells were fixed with 75% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and resuspended in the same buffer containing 50 μg/ml PI (from 5 mg/ml stock in 38 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.4), and 200 μg/ml RNase A. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, cells were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry. MCF-7 and MCF-7/p53A135V cells were prepared for flow cytometry as described for the BJ/TERT time course. For analysis of transient overexpression of the PARP-1 DBD, MCF-7 cells were transfected as described previously. Transfected cells were plated on 150-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were irradiated 38 h post-transfection, and 16 h later, prepared for flow cytometric analysis with the following modifications: cells were stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD20 antibody (BD Pharmingen) for 30 min at 4 °C prior to ethanol fixation, and 10 μg/ml PI was used. Both CD20+ and CD20– cells were analyzed for DNA content. Cell cycle distribution was determined with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The relative proportion of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined using ModFit LT 2.0 software (Verity Software House Inc.). Human MCF-7 and BJ/TERT Cells Express a Single Species with NAD- and DNA-dependent PARP Activity Corresponding to PARP-1—The recent demonstration that mouse cells express at least two proteins with DNA-dependent PARP activity prompted us to examine PARP activity in human MCF-7 and BJ/TERT cells using an in situ based activity assay. Activity-Western blots were performed with nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts equivalent to 100,000 BJ/TERT and MCF-7 cells. Purified bovine PARP-1 was included as a positive control. It has been previously shown that normal mouse embryo fibroblasts have two active poly(ADP-ribosyl)ating species; a major active band corresponding to the 113-kDa PARP-1 and a second active band with an approximate molecular mass of 60 kDa corresponding to sPARP-1 (29Sallmann F.R. Vodenicharov M.D. Wang Z.Q. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15504-15511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, the human cell lines BJ/TERT and MCF-7 express only one protein species capable of NAD+-dependent self-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the presence of DNA strand breaks, provided by the DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA (Fig. 1A). This protein is present predominantly in the nuclear fraction and corresponds to PARP-1. NAD+-dependent self-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 is also observed in the activity blot performed without DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA (Fig. 1B), but to a significantly lesser extent, confirming that PARP-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity is activated by DNA strand breaks. Disruption of PARP by Chemical Inhibition Suppresses p21 and mdm-2 Protein Induction following Ionizing Radiation— Chemical inhibition of PARP activity with specific inhibitors, such as IQ and 3-aminobenzamide, has been shown to suppress p53-dependent induction of p21 following DNA damage in several cell lines, including the human leukemia-derived OCI/AML-3 cell line (12Vaziri H. West M.D. Allsopp R.C. Davison T.S. Wu Y.S. Arrowsmith C.H. Poirier G.G. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6018-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). To investigate the consequences of PARP inhibition on the MCF-7 and BJ/TERT cell lines, these cells were treated with IQ (MCF-7 at 200 μm, BJ/TERT at 350 μm) for 1 h, γ-irradiated (MCF-7 at 6 Gy, BJ/TERT at 2 Gy), and a Western blot time course carried out at the indicated times (Fig. 2, A, left and right panels, and B). Following IR, cells not treated with IQ showed induction of both p21 and mdm-2, as expected. Prior treatment with the chemical inhibitor IQ resulted in a delay in the kinetics of induction of both proteins and to a suppression of mdm-2 and p21 protein accumulation. Most dramatic was the almost complete lack of p21 accumulation in BJ/TERT. Equal loading was confirmed by subsequent immunoblotting of the membranes with an antibody to actin (MCF-7) or by staining with Coomassie Blue (BJ/TERT and BJ/TERT-DD, data not shown). BJ/TERT and MCF-7 cells treated with IQ showed increased basal levels of both p53 and p21. p53 protein induction following IR was comparable in both the control and IQ-treated BJ/TERT cells although the accumulation of p53 was prolonged in the presence of IQ. In MCF-7 cells treated with IQ, we did not observe induction of p53 beyond the elevated basal level. BJ/TERT-DD cells express the C-terminal fragment of p53. This fragment has been shown to act as a potent trans-dominant repressor of wild type p53 through its ability to prevent the formation of functional p53 tetramers (31Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Endogenous p53 levels are high in these cells likely resulting from the formation of stable heterologous oligomers with the abundant C-terminal peptides. BJ/TERT-DD cells fail to induce p21 or mdm-2 in response to IR providing confirmation that the induction of p21 and mdm-2 in BJ/TERT cells is dependent on functional p53 (Fig. 2C). Disruption of PARP by Chemical Inhibition Suppresses Transcription of p21 mRNA following Ionizing Radiation—The p53-dependent elevation of p21 protein levels in response to ionizing radiation is controlled at the transcriptional level. We wished to investigate whether PARP inhibition with IQ interfered with the transactivation function of p53. BJ/TERT and MCF-7 cells were treated with 350 or 200 μm IQ and γ-irradiated with 2 or 6 Gy, respectively. Total RNA was prepared at the indicated times and Northern blot analysis was performed using radiolabel led p21 and GAPDH cDNA probes (Fig. 3, top panel). Following normalization to GAPDH, RNA levels were quantitated and plotted (Fig. 3, bottom panel). In non-treated MCF-7 cells, p21 mRNA levels were induced by 2 h following IR, and remained elevated at subsequent time points. In MCF-7 cells treated with IQ, the induction of p21 mRNA following IR was delayed by 1.5 to 2 h compared with non-treated cells, an effect similar to that observed at the protein level (Fig. 2A). BJ/TERT cells showed a more dramatic effect: prior treatment with IQ led to almost complete suppression of p21 mRNA induction at all time points. These results indicate that IQ suppresses induction of p21 expression in response to IR by interfering with the transactivation function of p53. Disruption of PARP by Chemical Inhibition Suppresses the p53-mediated G1Arrest Response following Ionizing Radiation—p21 is a critical effector of the p53-mediated G1 arrest response following DNA damage. Both MCF-7 cells and BJ/TERT cells undergo G1 arrest in response to low doses of ionizing radiation (33Vaziri H. Squire J.A. Pandita T.K. Bradley G. Kuba R.M. Zhang H. Gulyas S. Hill R.P. Nolan G.P.

Radiat. Biol. 1997; 72: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our result showing that PARP inhibition suppresses p53-mediated transactivation of p21 indicates that PARP inhibition should lead to disruption of the p53-dependent G1 checkpoint. To test this possibility, cell cycle analysis using PI to assess DNA content was performed. BJ/TERT and BJ/TERT-DD cells were treated with 350 μm IQ, γ-irradiated at 2 Gy, and 24 h later cell cycle analyses were performed by flow cytometry. The proportion of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined in three (BJ/TERT-DD) or six (BJ/TERT) independent experiments and the mean values summarized (Fig. 4A, top panel). Also shown are the G1/S ratios (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). In addition to G1 arrest, ionizing radiation c"

MMP expression is widespread in common human tumors, with MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -11, and/or -14 found most often (3Nelson A.R. Fingleton B. Rothenberg M.L. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 1135-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these MMPs, a great deal of attention has been focused on the two gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9. MMP-2 expression is found in the greatest variety of stromal tissue surrounding neoplasms (5Corcoran M.L. Hewitt R.E. Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and cleavage of certain ECM components by MMP-2 may reveal “cryptic sites” that aid cell migration and growth and angiogenesis (6Giannelli G.

Fusco C. Romero P. Stamenkovic I. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5213-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), which in turn decreases tumor cell susceptibility to natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. MMP-9 expression has been shown to increase in advanced-stage melanoma cells (13MacDougall J.R. Bani M.R. Lin Y. Rak J. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4174-4181PubMed Google Scholar). Although the vast majority of studies on MMP regulation examine factors that up-regulate MMP production, the ability to differentially examine actual MMP activity is necessary to discern which MMPs are critical to the invasion process. The hydrolysis of collagen is one of the committed steps in ECM turnover, and it has long been demonstrated that tumor extracts can possess collagenolytic activity (14Labrosse K.R. Liener I.E. Hargrave P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The triple-helical structure of collagen renders it resistant to most mammalian proteases, with the exception of cathepsin K and MMPs. Thus, triple-helical collagen-like substrates may provide an effective screening tool for activated tumor cell proteases. Such substrates could be used to determine whether different triple-helical sequences can be cleaved selectively by MMP family members and, if so, how the kinetics of hydrolysis compare. Several approaches have been described for construction of THP substrates (recently reviewed in Refs. 15Lauer-Fields J.L. Juska D. Fields G.B.

Non-covalent self-assembly of lipophilic molecules, N-terminal linked to a peptide, can be used to form stable triple-helical “peptide-amphiphiles” for mechanistic evaluation of MMP activity (17Lauer-Fields J.L.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer triple-helical peptide-amphiphile substrates have been constructed by combining a sequence based on the type II collagen 769–783 region, a fluorophore (Lys(Mca)) in the P5 subsite, and a quencher (Lys(Dnp)) in the P5′ subsite (19Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5795-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Individual kinetic parameters for MMP hydrolysis were then determined using a continuous fluorometric assay (19Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5795-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fluorogenic substrates can be used to examine other triple-helical sequences for selective MMP hydrolysis. As a starting point, we can consider the five triple-helical collagen sequences hydrolyzed by MMPs that have been identified. 2Although MMP-3 and -9 cleavage sites within the triple-helical region of type IV collagen have been identified (57Mott J.D.

The THPs use the α1(V)436–450 sequence Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly↓Val-Val-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Pro-Pro as a template. We have compared the susceptibility of the THPs to several MMP family members (MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -13, and -14) and determined individual kinetic parameters by continuous monitoring of a fluorogenic THP. Mechanistic aspects of MMP hydrolysis have been examined by comparing activities toward THPs and the analogous SSPs. Ultimately, fluorogenic THPs were used to assess MMP-2/-9 and general MMP activity in α2β1 integrin-stimulated metastatic melanoma cells.

Amino acids are of thel-configuration (except for Gly). Hexanoic acid (CH3-(CH2)4-CO2H, designated C6) was purchased from Aldrich. THPs were synthesized and purified by methods previously described in our laboratory (19Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Nagase H. Fields G.B.

Analytical RP-HPLC was performed on a Hewlett Packard 1100 liquid chromatograph equipped with a Hypersil small-pore, narrow-bore C18 reversed-phase column (5-μm particle size, 120-Å pore size, 100 × 2.1 mm). Eluants were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (B). The elution gradient was 0–100% B in 20 min with a flow of 0.3 ml/min. Detection was at λ = 229, 324, and 363 nm. Edman degradation sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer/120A analyzer as described (31Fields C.G. VanDrisse V.L. Fields G.B. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 39-47PubMed Google Scholar) for “embedded” (non-covalent) sequencing. MALDI-MS was performed on a Hewlett-Packard G2025A mass spectrometer using either a sinapinic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid/2-hydroxy-5-methoxy-benzoic acid (9:1, v/v) matrix (32Henkel W. Vogl T. Echner H. Voelter W. Urbanke C. Schleuder D. Rauterberg J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13610-13622Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Single-chain mass values were as follows: α1(V)436–450 THP, [M+H]+ 3636.2 Da (theoretical 3639.9 Da); α1(V)436–450 SSP, [M+H]+ 1402.9 Da (theoretical 1403.5 Da); α1(V)436–447 fTHP, [M+H]+ 4487.4 Da (theoretical 4490.7 Da); and α1(IV)402–413, [M+H]+ 3609.3 Da (theoretical 3609.0 Da). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded over the range λ = 190–250 nm on a JASCO J-600 using a 10-mm path length quartz cell. Thermal transition curves were obtained by recording the molar ellipticity ([Θ]) at λ = 225 nm while the temperature was continuously increased in the range of 5–80 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/min. Temperature was controlled using a JASCO PTC-348WI temperature control unit. For samples exhibiting sigmoidal melting curves, the reflection point in the transition region (first derivative) is defined as the melting temperature (Tm). M14 human melanoma cells were propagated as described previously (33Miles A.J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Fields G.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, melanoma cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium or RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine sera, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin (Roche Applied Science), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were passaged 8 times and then replaced from frozen stocks of early passage cells to minimize phenotypic drift. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. All media reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific. ProMMP-1 and proMMP-3 were expressed in Escherichia coli and folded from the inclusion bodies as described previously (36Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29610-29617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). ProMMP-2 was purified from the culture medium of human uterine cervical fibroblasts (37Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ProMMP-2 was activated by reacting with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate at 25 °C for 2 h. ProMMP-1 was activated by reacting with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate and a 0.1 molar amount of MMP-3 at 37 °C for 6 h. After activation, MMP-3 was completely removed from MMP-1 by affinity chromatography using an anti-MMP-3 IgG Affi-Gel 10 column. ProMMP-3 was activated to the 45-kDa MMP-3 by reacting with 5 μg/ml chymotrypsin at 37 °C for 2 h. Chymotrypsin was inactivated with 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. ProMMP-13 was a generous gift from Dr. Maureen Horrocks, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. ProMMP-9 and MMP-14 were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). ProMMP-9 and -13 were activated with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. The amounts of active MMP-1, -2, and -3 were determined by titration with recombinant N-terminal domain of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (38Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) over a concentration range of 0.1–3 μg/ml. Two different assay methods were utilized, the first for discontinuous fluorometric analyses and the second for continuous fluorometric analyses. For the discontinuous assay method, α1(V)436–450 THP was prepared as 270 μm stock solution in “fluorometric assay” buffer (50 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35). A 0.5-m stock solution ofo-phenanthroline was prepared in Me2SO, followed by dilution with assay buffer to a concentration of 20 mm. MMP assays were carried out in assay buffer by incubating a range of substrate concentrations with 40 nm enzyme at 30 °C. Enzymatic activity was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of the enzyme/substrate solution to 30 μl of o-phenanthroline (20 mm) at appropriate times. Rates of hydrolysis were monitored by the addition of 200 μl of fluorescamine solution. Fluorescamine solution was prepared by first dissolving fluorescamine in acetone at a concentration of 40 mm, then diluting to 5 mm with assay buffer minus Brij-35. Fluorescamine reacts with free amino groups, resulting in a fluorophore with λexcitation = 387 nm and λemission = 480 nm. Fluorescence was measured on a Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax Gemini dual-scanning microplate spectrofluorometer. For continuous fluorometric analyses, substrate α1(V)436–447 fTHP was prepared as 270 μm stock solution in fluorometric assay buffer. MMP assays were carried out in assay buffer by incubating a range of substrate concentrations (1–50 μm) with 40 nm enzyme at 30 °C. Fluorescence was measured using λexcitation = 325 nm and λemission = 393 nm. Initial velocities were obtained from plots of fluorescenceversus time, using only data points corresponding to less than 40% full hydrolysis. The slope from these plots was divided by the fluorescence change corresponding to complete hydrolysis and then multiplied by the substrate concentration to obtain initial velocity in units of μm/s. The fluorogenic substrates NFF-1, NFF-3, and fTHP-4 were used for control assays of MMP activity as described (19Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Nagase H. Fields G.B.

Melanoma cell adhesion to substrate-coated non-tissue culture-treated plates (BD Biosciences) was performed as described previously (35Lauer J.L. Gendron C.M. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The α1(IV)402–413 ligand was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, diluted in 70% ethanol, added to the 96-well plate, and allowed to adsorb overnight at room temperature with mixing. Plates were rinsed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline to remove all traces of ethanol. Cells were released with 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and washed two times with adhesion medium (20 mm HEPES, RPMI 1640). Cells were then resuspended in adhesion medium and added to the plate. The plate was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing three times with adhesion medium, and fresh medium was added. Conditioned media were collected at various time points, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and stored at −20 °C. One volume of the appropriate fluorogenic substrate was added to each well in a 96-well plate. Where applicable, EDTA was added to each well. The plate was incubated at 30 °C in a humidified atmosphere for 30 min, and one volume of conditioned media, adhesion medium (as a negative control), or MMP (as a positive control) was added to each well. The plate was incubated at 30 °C in a humidified atmosphere for at least 18 h. Fluorescence readings (λexcitation = 325 nm and λemission = 393 nm) were taken and a standard curve created by plotting the increase in fluorescence versus concentration of MMP standard. The standard curve was used to calculate the active enzyme concentration in the conditioned media. The first THP constructed as a possible MMP-2 and -9 substrate was based upon the MMP-9 cleavage site in types V and XI collagen. It incorporated the α1(V)436–450 sequence between N- and C-terminal (Gly-Pro-Hyp)4 repeating tripeptides and an N-terminal C6 alkyl chain (C6-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly↓Val-Val-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Pro-Pro(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-NH2). The α1(V)436–450 THP had a Tm value of 49.5 °C in 1.0% (v/v) fluorometric assay buffer (Fig.1), which is a desirable thermal stability for an MMP substrate. The composition and homogeneity were confirmed by Edman degradation sequence analysis (prior to addition of the C6 alkyl chain), RP-HPLC, and MALDI-MS. MMP-1 and MMP-9 hydrolysis of α1(V)436–450 THP was studied at 30 °C using the discontinuous fluorometric assay with 40 μm substrate. MMP-9 rapidly hydrolyzed the substrate within 1 h, whereas MMP-1 did not cleave the substrate even after 24 h. MMP-9 hydrolysis of the α1(V)436–450 THP was analyzed by MALDI-MS. Each intact chain of the α1(V)436–450 THP has a mass of 3638.9 Da. If the Gly-Val bond is cleaved, the two products generated in assay buffer are the single-stranded peptides C6-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly ([M+Na]+ = 1515.6 Da) and Val-Val-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Pro-Pro-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-NH2([M+Na]+ = 2187.3 Da). Mass spectrometric analysis of MMP-9 hydrolysis showed two products, one of [M+Na]+ = 1516.2 Da and one of [M+Na]+ = 2189.8 Da. No hydrolysis of the substrate by MMP-1 was detected using MALDI-MS analysis. The α1(V)436–450 THP is the first synthetic substrate that shows complete selectivity between MMP-1 and MMP-9. Subsequent treatment of α1(V)436–450 THP with MMP-2 and MALDI-MS analysis indicated cleavage at the Gly-Val bond. Edman degradation sequence analysis of the α1(V)436–450 THP cleavage products also showed that MMP-2 hydrolysis occurred exclusively at the Gly-Val bond, because the only amino acids seen in the first two cycles are PTH-Val and PTH-Val (emanating from the C-terminal fragment of the cleaved THP). Thus, both Edman degradation sequence analysis and MALDI-MS analyses indicated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 cleaved the α1(V)436–450 THP exclusively at the Gly-Val bond. This is the analogous bond cleaved by MMP-9 in types V and XI collagen (28Niyibizi C. Chan R. Wu J.-J. Eyre D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the cleavage sites for MMP-2 hydrolysis of type V collagen have not been determined, the digestion pattern is very similar to that of MMP-9 (41Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Gly439-Val440 bond could be cleaved by MMP-2 in intact type V collagen. To determine whether primary structure alone accounted for the observed MMP-2/-9 selectivity, an SSP analog of the α1(V)436–450 sequence (Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly↓Val-Val-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Pro-Pro-NH2) was constructed and incubated with several different MMPs. RP-HPLC and MALDI-MS indicated that the α1(V)436–450 SSP was very slowly cleaved by MMP-3 and -9. Interestingly, MMP-9 hydrolyzed the α1(V)436–450 SSP at a considerably slower rate than the α1(V)436–450 THP. Thus, primary structure was not the sole determinant for MMP-2/-9 selectivity of the α1(V)436–450 THP, and substrate triple-helical conformation greatly enhanced hydrolysis rates. These results suggest that MMP-9 acts as a true “collagenase,” preferentially cleaving a specific sequence in triple-helical conformation, whereas MMP-3 has limited triple-helical peptidase activity. Based on the results with α1(V)436–450 THP, a fluorogenic substrate was designed and designated α1(V)436–447 fTHP ((Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-Gly-Pro-Lys(Mca)-Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly↓Val-Val-Gly-Glu-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-Glu-Gln-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-NH2). The Gln in the P5′ subsite from α1(V)436–450 THP was replaced with Lys(Dnp), whereas Hyp in the P5 subsite was replaced with Lys(Mca). Prior studies indicated that MMP-2 and -9 well tolerate substitution of a P5 subsite Hyp by a bulky aromatic residue (42Xia T. Akers K. Eisen A.Z. Seltzer J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1293: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To improve substrate solubility while not sacrificing thermal stability, (a) the C6 alkyl chain was replaced by two Gly-Pro-Hyp repeats on the N terminus and (b) an additional Gly-Pro-Hyp repeat was added to the C terminus. The α1(V)436–447 fTHP has a Tmvalue of 45.0 °C in 1.0% (v/v) fluorometric assay buffer (Fig. 1), which is a desirable thermal stability for an MMP substrate. The composition and homogeneity were confirmed by Edman degradation sequence analysis, RP-HPLC, and MALDI-MS. Edman degradation sequence analysis of the α1(V)436–447 fTHP cleavage products showed that MMP-2 hydrolysis occurred exclusively at the Gly-Val bond, because the only amino acids seen in the first three cycles are PTH-Val, PTH-Val, and PTH-Gly (emanating from the C-terminal fragment of the cleaved THP). MMP-2 and -9 hydrolysis of the α1(V)436–447 fTHP was also examined by MALDI-MS. Each intact chain of the α1(V)436–447 fTHP has a mass of 4489.7 Da. If the Gly-Val bond is cleaved, the two products generated are the single-stranded peptides (Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-Gly-Pro-Lys(Mca)-Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly ([M+H]+ = 2162.3 Da) and Val-Val-Gly-Glu-Lys(Dnp)-Gly-Glu-Gln-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)5-NH2([M+H]+ = 2347.5 Da). Mass spectrometric analysis of MMP-2 or MMP-9 hydrolysis showed two products of [M+H]+ = 2159.6 and 2346.4 Da. Thus, both Edman degradation sequence analysis and MALDI mass spectrometric analyses indicated that MMP-2 and -9 cleaved the α1(V)436–447 fTHP exclusively at the Gly-Val bond. No hydrolysis of the substrate by MMP-1, -3, -13, or -14 was detected using MALDI-MS analysis. Individual kinetic parameters for MMP hydrolysis of α1(V)436–447 fTHP were evaluated by Lineweaver-Burk (Fig. 2), Hanes-Woolf, and Eadie-Hoftsee analyses. The relative order of apparentkcat/Km values is MMP-2 > MMP-9 ≫ MMP-14 ∼MMP-13 > MMP-1 ∼MMP-3 (TableI). MMP-2 has the highestkcat/Km value for hydrolysis of α1(V)436–447 fTHP, because of both a lower Kmvalue (4.4 μm for MMP-2 versus 8.1 for MMP-9) and a higher kcat value. For MMP-2, α1(V)436–447 fTHP is a 13-fold better substrate than the previously described triple-helical substrate fTHP-3 (TableII), which is modeled after the type II collagen MMP cleavage site. MMP-2 prefers α1(V)436–447 fTHP to type I collagen (Table II). MMP-2 cleaves type V collagen very efficiently, although at a 4-fold lower rate than MMP-9 (41Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, some differences exist between triple-helical peptidase and collagenolysis specificity, as previously observed (18Lauer-Fields J.L. Tuzinski K.A. Shimokawa K. Nagase H. Fields G.B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2013329423,"The human multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1) contributes to the poor bioavailability of many anticancer and antimicrobial agents as well as to drug resistance at the cellular level. For rational design of effective Pgp inhibitors, a clear understanding of its mechanism of action and functional regulation is essential. In this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of Pgp-mediated drug transport bycis-(Z)-flupentixol, a thioxanthene derivative, occurs through an allosteric mechanism. Unlike competitive inhibitors, such as cyclosporin A and verapamil,cis-(Z)-flupentixol does not interfere with substrate ([125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin) recognition by Pgp, instead it prevents substrate translocation and dissociation, resulting in a stable but reversible Pgp-substrate complex.cis-(Z)-Flupentixol-induced complex formation requires involvement of the Pgp substrate site, because agents that either physically compete (cyclosporin A) for or indirectly occlude (vanadate) the substrate-binding site prevent formation of the complex. Allosteric modulation by cis-(Z)-flupentixol involves a conformational change in Pgp detectable by monoclonal antibody UIC2 binding to a conformation-sensitive external epitope of Pgp. The conformational change observed is distinct from that induced by Pgp substrates or competitive inhibitors. A single amino acid substitution (F983A) in TM12 of Pgp that impairs inhibition bycis-(Z)-flupentixol of Pgp-mediated drug transport also affects stabilization of the Pgp-substrate complex as well as the characteristic conformational change. Taken together, our results describe the molecular mechanism by which the Pgp modulatorcis-(Z)-flupentixol allosterically inhibits drug transport."
https://openalex.org/W2005289288,"The duration as well as the magnitude of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation has been proposed to regulate gene expression and other specific intracellular responses in individual cell types. Activation of ERK1/2 by the hypothalamic neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is relatively sustained in αT3-1 pituitary gonadotropes and HEK293 cells but is transient in immortalized GT1-7 neurons. Each of these cell types expresses the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and responds to EGF stimulation with significant but transient ERK1/2 phosphorylation. However, GnRH-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation caused by EGFR transactivation was confined to GT1-7 cells and was attenuated by EGFR kinase inhibition. Neither EGF nor GnRH receptor activation caused translocation of phospho-ERK1/2 into the nucleus in GT1-7 cells. In contrast, agonist stimulation of GnRH receptors expressed in HEK293 cells caused sustained phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 by a protein kinase C-dependent but EGFR-independent pathway. GnRH-induced activation of ERK1/2 was attenuated by the selective Src kinase inhibitor PP2 and the negative regulatory C-terminal Src kinase in GT1-7 cells but not in HEK293 cells. In GT1-7 cells, GnRH stimulated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the ERK1/2-dependent protein, p90RSK-1 (RSK-1). These results indicate that the duration of ERK1/2 activation depends on the signaling pathways utilized by GnRH in specific target cells. Whereas activation of the Gq/protein kinase C pathway in HEK293 cells causes sustained phosphorylation and translocation of ERK1/2 to the nucleus, transactivation of the EGFR by GnRH in GT1-7 cells elicits transient ERK1/2 signals without nuclear accumulation. These findings suggest that transactivation of the tightly regulated EGFR can account for the transient ERK1/2 responses that are elicited by stimulation of certain G protein-coupled receptors.

These include the generation of second messengers (Ca2+, PKC, and cAMP), G protein subunit coupling to novel effectors, and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and insulin-like growth factor receptor (1Gschwind A.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). MAP kinases are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated by a wide spectrum of stimuli, ranging from mitogens and growth factors to cellular stress and neurotoxic factors. The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are closely related members of the MAP kinase family that are predominantly activated by growth factors and GPCRs and play an important role in cell survival, motility, and secretion (3Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 22: 368-376Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Although the physiological roles of MAP kinase activation are diverse, the convergence of signals emanating from GPCRs and RTKs often leads to the activation of mitogenic pathways associated with cell proliferation. The choice between proliferation and differentiation is primarily determined by the duration and strength of ERK1/2 activation, and transient versus sustained activation of ERK1/2 can elicit different types of responses. Sustained activation of ERK1/2 (e.g. by fibroblast growth factor or nerve growth factor) usually leads to differentiation (4Kao S.-C. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol.

In general, sustained ERK1/2 activation is associated with the translocation of ERK1/2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (7Liang C.-C. Chen H.-C. J. Biol.

Whereas GPCR-mediated ERK1/2 activation can be either transient or sustained, EGF-induced responses are usually of short duration (4Kao S.-C. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol.

The aberrant expression or dysfunction of RTKs can produce a variety of diseases and developmental disorders (19Schlessinger J.

Several mechanisms exist for the attenuation and termination of RTK and ERK1/2 activation (19Schlessinger J.

The mammalian GnRHR lacks a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and accordingly is slowly internalized and desensitized (22Hislop J.N. Everest H.M. Flynn A. Harding T. Uney J.B. Troskie B.E. Millar R.P.

For this reason, GnRH-mediated signaling tends to be relatively sustained in pituitary gonadotropes and other cell types expressing endogenous GnRHRs, as well as in receptor-transfected HEK293 cells (10Liu F.

Endocrinol. 2002; 173: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, we recently observed that GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation in the GT1-7 hypothalamic neuronal cell line is quite transient (18Shah B.H. Soh J.W. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2866-2875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reasons for such short-lived signaling by GnRH and its impact on cellular activities including subcellular distribution of activated ERK1/2 are not known. An analysis of the differential effects of GnRH on the duration of ERK1/2 activation revealed that GnRH action in GT1-7 cells involves Src and EGFR transactivation that results in transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which does not undergo nuclear translocation. In contrast, ERK1/2 responses to activation of GnRHR expressed in HEK293 cells are independent of Src and EGFR but are dependent on PKC and lead to sustained activation and subsequent accumulation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus. Materials—GnRH was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA), EGF was from Invitrogen, and pertussis toxin was from List Biological Labs. Protein assay kits were from Pierce. ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibodies were from New England Biolabs, and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc. Antibodies against Src, EGFR, phospho-EGFR (Tyr1173/Tyr1068), and phosphotyrosine (PY20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and anti-phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068) was from BIOSOURCE International. AG1478, Go6983, Ro 31-8220, PP2, BAPTA, and PMA were from Calbiochem, and LipofectAMINE was from Invitrogen. The Src negative regulatory kinase (Csk) was provided by Dr. Zvi Naor (University of Tel Aviv). Western blotting reagents and ECL were obtained from Amersham Biosciences or Pierce. Cell Culture—GT1-7 neurons donated by Dr. Richard Weiner (University of California, San Francisco) were grown in culture medium consisting of 500 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.584 g/liter l-glutamate and 4.5 g/liter glucose, mixed with 500 ml of F-12 medium containing 0.146 g/liter l-glutamate, 1.8 g/liter glucose, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 2.5 g/liter sodium carbonate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. DNA transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of GnRHR in HEK293 Cells—The 1020-base pair mouse GnRHR cDNA was tagged with an hemagglutinin epitope at its N terminus and subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector between BglII and SmaI sites. HEK293 cells were cultured in 24-well plate and transfected with 500 ng of subcloned hemagglutinin-GnRHR cDNA in opti-MEM containing 3 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 for 2 h. After 24 h the cells were trypsinized and plated in a 100-mm culture dish at very low density (100–500 cells/dish). On the next day, incubation was continued in culture medium containing 200 μm G418 for selection. Several colonies were obtained within 2 weeks, and the studies were performed on a stably transfected HEK293 cells. Transfections—GT1-7 or HEK293 cells were transfected with Csk (2 μg) using LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM-1 (Invitrogen). After 5 h, the cells were switched to regular serum-containing medium for 24 h followed by replacement with serum-free medium overnight. The cells were treated with agonist and collected in Laemmli lysis buffer for immunoblot analysis. Inositol Phosphate Measurements—The cells were labeled for 24 h in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 μCi/ml [3H]inositol as previously described (18Shah B.H. Soh J.W. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2866-2875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and then washed twice with inositol-free M199 medium and stimulated at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. The reactions were stopped with perchloric acid, inositol phosphates were extracted, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation γ-spectrometry. Immunocytochemistry—The cells were plated at low density on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 24 h, then rinsed, and incubated in serum-free medium for 12–24 h. The cells were then treated with GnRH or EGF for the time periods indicated. Following stimulation, cells were rinsed in warm PBS and fixed in 3.7% fomaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were then permeablized by immersing coverslips in 100% methanol for 5 min and then incubated at 37 °C in blocking medium (3% bovine serum albumin and 3% normal serum) for 60 min. Following incubation in primary antibodies diluted (1:50) in blocking medium, coverslips were washed with 3× PBS and incubated with Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse or Cy5-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS and mounted in ProLong mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and the images were taken with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. Immunoprecipitation—After treatment with inhibitors and drugs, the cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstain, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzensulfonyl fluoride, and probe-sonicated (Sonifier Cell Disruptor). The solubilized lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min, precleared with agarose, and then incubated with specific antibodies and protein A- or G-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were collected, washed four times with LB, and dissolved in Laemmli buffer. After heating at 95 °C for 5 min, the samples were centrifuged briefly, and the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8–16% gradient gels. Immunoblot Analysis—The cells were grown in 6-well plates and at 60–70% confluence were serum-starved for 24 h before treatment at 37 °C with selected agents. The media were then aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were briefly sonicated, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatant was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (8–16%) gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 before probing with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then visualized with ECL (Amersham Biosciences or Pierce) and quantitated with a scanning laser densitometer. In some cases, the blots were stripped and reprobed with other antibodies. Agonist stimulation of GT1-7 neuronal cells, which express endogenous receptors for GnRH and EGF, caused rapid but transient ERK1/2 activation, with a maximum response at 5 min and subsequent decline (Fig. 1A). In the same cells, EGF likewise caused marked but transient ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 1B). Both EGF and GnRH caused phosphorylation of the EGFR as measured by immunoprecipitation of the EGFR and immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2A). ERK1/2 activation by both GnRH and EGF was abolished by the selective EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478, consistent with the need for EGFR transactivation during GnRH-induced ERK1/2 signaling in GT1-7 cells (Fig. 2, B–D).Fig. 2EGFR transactivation mediates GnRH-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GT1-7 cells.A, effects of GnRH and EGF on tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR in GT1-7 cells.

To evaluate the involvement of metalloproteases in transactivation of the EGFR by GnRH, GT1-7 cells were pretreated with the selective metalloprotease inhibitor, GM6001, and stimulated with GnRH. As shown in Fig. 3, GM6001 abolished GnRH-induced activation of ERK1/2. However, GM6001 had no inhibitory effect on ERK1/2 activation induced by EGF or HB-EGF stimulation. These findings indicate the specificity of GM6001 and also demonstrate the dependence of GnRH signaling on metalloprotease action upstream of the EGFR. We next examined the effects of GnRH on ERK1/2 signaling in HEK293 cells transfected with the GnRHR. These cells express endogenous EGFRs and have been used in recent studies to analyze the signaling properties of the GnRHR (23Willars G.B. Heding A. Vrecl M. Sellar R. Blomenrohr M. Nahorski S.R.

As in GT1-7 cells, ERK1/2 activation by EGF was transient, reaching a peak between 2 and 5 min and declining thereafter toward basal levels (Fig. 4A). EGF stimulation also caused marked phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr1173 that was attenuated by AG1478 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast to GT1-7 cells, GnRH stimulation of HEK293 cells caused rapid and sustained ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 5A). EGF, but not GnRH or PMA, caused marked phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 5B). Moreover, GnRH-mediated ERK1/2 activation was not affected by the selective EGFR kinase antagonist, AG1478 (Fig. 6A), which abolished the effect of EGF on ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). These findings demonstrate that GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation in HEK293 cells is independent of EGFR transactivation.Fig. 6Absence of EGFR transactivation by GnRH in HEK293 cells.A and B, effects of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition by AG1478 on ERK1/2 phosphorylation by GnRH and EGF in HEK293 cells. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of AG1478 for 20 min before stimulation with GnRH (A, 200 μm) and EGF (B, 50 ng/ml) for 5 min. The lower panels show total ERK1/2. Quantitation of the relative effects of AG1478 on ERK1/2 activation by GnRH and EGF is shown in the bottom panel (n = 3).

Con, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the effects of transient and sustained activation of ERK1/2 on its translocation to the nucleus, the cellular distribution of GnRH-activated ERK1/2 in GT1-7 and HEK293 cells was examined by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 7 (A and B), nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 occurred only during the sustained ERK1/2 activation induced by GnRH in HEK293 cells and was not observed in GT1-7 cells. In comparison, EGF failed to cause nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 in GT1-7 cells (Fig. 7C) following EGF stimulation. These data show that the transient GnRH-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GT1-7 cells that occurs through transactivation of the EGFR does not cause translocation of activated ERK1/2 into the nucleus. However, in HEK293 cells, GnRH causes sustained ERK phosphorylation responses that are independent of EGFR transactivation and are accompanied by prominent nuclear translocation of the activated ERK1/2. To explore the cause(s) of the differential signaling of GnRH in these two cell types, we examined the mechanism of GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation. Depletion of PKC by prolonged treatment with PMA (1 μm for 16 h) blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by GnRH in both GT1-7 and HEK293 cells (Fig. 8A), consistent with the major role of PKC in GnRH signaling. However, PKC depletion had no effect on the EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2 in these cell types. These data suggest that PKC is a common upstream mediator of GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation in both cell types. To confirm that PKC activation in GT1-7 cells causes phosphorylation of ERK1/2 through EGFR transactivation, we pretreated the cells with AG1478 and measured ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by PMA. This revealed that ERK1/2 activation by PMA (100 nm for 10 min) was significantly attenuated by AG1478 in GT1-7 cells but not in HEK293 cells (Fig. 8B). These data suggest that GnRH-mediated PKC activation signals through the EGFR only in GT1-7 cells. Because Src kinase has been implicated in GPCR-mediated EGFR transactivation, we examined the effects of Src inhibition on GnRH-mediated ERK1/2 activation. Inhibition of Src by the selective Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, or overexpression of Csk attenuated agonist-induced ERK1/2 activation in GT1-7 cells (Fig. 9A). However, EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation was not affected by PP2 or Csk overexpression (data not shown). In contrast to its action in GT1-7 cells, Src inhibition had no effect on GnRH-mediated ERK1/2 activation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 9B). These results show that Src kinase is required for GnRH-mediated ERK1/2 activation in GT1-7 cells and acts upstream of the EGFR. In contrast, GnRH does not utilize Src and EGFR transactivation in HEK293 cells and therefore does not mimic the short term signaling characteristics of EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 is often translocated to the nucleus and elicits a variety of transcriptional responses (3Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 22: 368-376Scopus (842) Google Scholar). However, neither GnRH nor EGF caused nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 in GT1-7 cells, as shown in Fig. 7. Interestingly, GnRH is known to increase c-fos expression in these cells, indicative of transcriptional activation (26Cesnjaj M. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 3042-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether other intermediate signaling molecules are involved in the transmission of mitogenic signals from activated cytosolic ERK1/2 to the nucleus, we examined the interaction of ERK1/2 with p90 ribosomal S6 kinase(s) (p90RSK or RSK1), which undergoes translocation to the nucleus after phosphorylation by ERK1/2 (27Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Both EGF and GnRH markedly stimulated phosphorylation of RSK-1 at Ser360/Thr364 in GT1-7 cells in a MEK-dependent manner. GnRH-stimulated RSK-1 phosphorylation was attenuated by inhibition of PKC and Src (Fig. 10A). Similarly, EGF-induced RSK-1 phosphorylation was inhibited by AG1478 and the MEK inhibitor, PD98059 but not by the Src inhibitor, PP2. As expected, RSK-1 phosphorylation by GnRH was also abolished by the EGFR kinase antagonist, AG1478 (Fig. 10B). These data indicate that GnRH-induced RSK-1 phosphorylation in GT1-7 cells is mediated by PKC, Src, and EGFR transactivation and that Src acts upstream of the EGFR. To determine whether RSK-1 is translocated to the nucleus following GnRH stimulation, we visualized its distribution in GT1-7 cells. Under basal conditions, RSK-1 was predominantly present in the cytosol. However, GnRH stimulation caused marked accumulation of RSK-1 in the nucleus (Fig. 11). These results suggest that the agonist-induced changes in c-fos gene expression observed in GT1-7 cells (26Cesnjaj M. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 3042-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) could be mediated by ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of RSK-1. Our results show that, depending on cell type, GnRH-induced ERK1/2 activation can occur through both the Gq/PKC/Raf pathway and Gq/PKC/Src/EGFR activation, with correspondingly distinct effects on the duration and cellular distribution of the activated ERK1/2.

https://openalex.org/W2081180949,"H-Ras displays dynamic cycles of GTP binding and palmitate turnover. GTP binding is clearly coupled to activation, but whether the palmitoylated COOH terminus participates in signaling, especially when constrained by membrane tethering, is unknown. As a way to compare COOH termini of membrane-bound, lipid-modified H-Ras, palmitate removal rates were measured for various forms of H-Ras in NIH 3T3 cells. Depalmitoylation occurred slowly (t½ ∼2.4 h) in cellular (H-RasWT) or dominant negative (H-Ras17N) forms and more rapidly (t½ ∼1 h) in oncogenic H-Ras61L or H-RasR12,T59. Combining this data with GTP binding measurements, the palmitate half-life of H-Ras in the fully GTP-bound state was estimated to be less than 10 min. Slow palmitate removal from cellular H-Ras was not explained by sequestration in caveolae, as neither cellular nor oncogenic H-Ras showed alignment with caveolin by immunofluorescence. Conversely, although it had faster palmitate removal, oncogenic H-Ras was located in the same fractions as H-RasWT on four types of density gradients, and remained fully membrane-bound. Thus the different rates of deacylation occurred even though oncogenic and cellular H-Ras appeared to be in similar locations. Instead, these results suggest that acylprotein thioesterases access oncogenic H-Ras more easily because the conformation of its COOH terminus against the membrane is altered. This previously undetected difference could help produce distinctive effector interactions and signaling of oncogenic H-Ras. H-Ras displays dynamic cycles of GTP binding and palmitate turnover.

This previously undetected difference could help produce distinctive effector interactions and signaling of oncogenic H-Ras. H-Ras is a small GTPase that acts as a molecular switch in multiple cellular signaling pathways. When bound to GDP, the protein is in an inactive conformation; upon GTP binding, structural rearrangements occur that allow H-Ras to interact with effector proteins, such as the protein kinase, Raf-1, or lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (1Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 2Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The structural changes that occur upon GTP binding have been well documented using x-ray crystallography and NMR, and describe a Switch I “effector” loop between amino acid residues 30–42 and a Switch II domain encompassing the region around amino acids Glu-60 and Tyr-64 (3Wittinghofer A. Nassar N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 488-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Mutations causing amino acid substitutions within these Switch domains can produce oncogenic forms of the protein. Although the amino acid changes in oncogenic forms of H-Ras cause a steady-state increase in GTP binding, few structural differences other than in the GTP-binding domains have been noted (3Wittinghofer A. Nassar N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 488-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev.

Thus, current models of H-Ras-mediated oncogenicity envision a heightened signal strength or duration from an otherwise “normal” GTP-bound form of the oncogenic protein. To produce a biological signal from its interaction with effectors, GTP-bound H-Ras must itself be bound to the plasma membrane. H-Ras acquires membrane association through permanent linkage of a farnesyl isoprenoid and more labile attachment of the fatty acid palmitate to cysteines in its COOH-terminal domain (5Casey P.J.

Importantly, most structural studies of H-Ras have been performed on soluble proteins that lack these lipids as well as the last ∼20 residues of the COOH terminus (8Pai E. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). There is currently no direct information on whether GTP binding might also influence the conformation of the H-Ras COOH-terminal membrane-binding domain. A new approach, bioorganic synthesis of lipidated protein (9Bader B. Kuhn K. Owen D.J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Kuhlmann J. Nature. 2000; 403: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), holds promise for determining the structure of the C terminus. One GTP-dependent role of the H-Ras COOH terminus has recently been proposed. This model suggests that inactive forms of H-Ras reside in plasma membrane caveolae and specialized subdomains of the lipid bilayer termed “rafts” (10Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 11Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apollini A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 97-105Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar). GTP binding is then postulated to drive H-Ras from these regions into the general “non-raft” domain of the membrane (12Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation is a clear candidate for a modulator of raft binding, as a growing multitude of acylated proteins are reported to partition into raft-like domains of various kinds (13McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3771-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol.

The presence of palmitate on proteins or membrane targeting sequences has been reported to enhance raft partitioning, whereas its absence often leads to apparently random distribution or decreased membrane binding (15Melkonian K.A.

Recently an acyltransferase activity capable of adding palmitate to Gαi has been identified in raft-like membranes, suggesting that (re)palmitoylation of Gα subunit proteins might occur in these subdomains and would support their enrichment there (19Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43300-43304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Whether a mammalian homolog of the newly discovered palmitoyltransferase for yeast Ras (20Lobo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41268-41273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) exists in rafts is not yet known. Notably, for Gα subunits, palmitate attachment and removal has not been linked with lateral movement in the membrane, but rather, with GTP binding, and interaction with regulatory proteins. During stimulation of intact cells with appropriate agonists, palmitates attached to the activated, GTP-bound α subunits of the Gs, Gi, Gq, and Go heterotrimeric G protein families have been reported to show increased turnover (21Bhamre S.

Additionally, palmitoylation decreases the affinity of αi and αz for the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins that control their rates of GTP hydrolysis, potentially prolonging the lifetime of the active GTP form (26Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Several studies have now provided evidence that the COOH-terminal, lipid-modified domain of H-Ras may influence effector activation. There have been multiple reports that farnesyl-modified forms of H-Ras interact more effectively with, and stimulate Raf-1 kinase more robustly than non-lipidated forms (27Drugan J.K. Khosravi-Far R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22172-22179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Additionally, earlier work had indicated that farnesyl-ation of Ras was important for its interaction with phospho-inositide 3-kinase (32Rubio I. Wittig U. Meyer C. Heinze R. Kadereit D. Waldmann H. Downward J. Wetzker R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An H-Ras with a unique palmitoylated but non-farnesylated COOH terminus has been found to hyperstimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase while activating B-Raf kinase poorly (33Booden M.A. Sakaguchi D.S. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23559-23568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Comparisons of H-Ras and K-Ras4B also suggest that the different modes of membrane interaction of these two proteins also produce distinct effector interactions (34Walsh A.B. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15609-15615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These studies point to the possibility that the lipidated COOH terminus, in addition to its already appreciated role of targeting H-Ras to plasma membranes (without regard for nucleotide state), may also participate in interactions of the GTP-bound form with effectors. Because of its reversibility and location in the COOH-terminal domain, palmitoylation is a useful reporter for potential structural COOH-terminal differences between cellular and oncogenic forms of H-Ras. Although enzymes are not yet readily available for in vitro manipulation of the palmitoylation state of H-Ras, metabolic labeling and pulse-chase methods with intact cells can be used to measure acylation and deacylation rates of H-Ras. Such in vivo studies should also provide unique information on the COOH terminus while it is attached to the complex and non-homogenous environment of membranes of living cells. We therefore examined the susceptibility to deacylation of cellular and oncogenic forms of H-Ras that displayed large and stable differences in GTP binding. The rates of palmitate removal varied substantially between these proteins, being slower on both a cellular and a dominant-negative form of H-Ras and faster on two oncogenic forms. The faster rates of palmitate removal indicated that, in the oncogenic forms, the palmitoylated Cys-181 and Cys-184 residues of H-Ras were more accessible to palmitoyl thioesterase(s). These results imply that an acylated, membrane-bound COOH terminus of oncogenic H-Ras has a previously undetected difference from cellular H-Ras. Cell Culture—NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with HRas61L, H-Ras12R,59T (B. Willumsen, University of Copenhagen), c-H-Ras (L. Quilliam, Indiana University School of Medicine), and inducible H-Ras17N (A. Kazlauskas, Harvard Medical School) were grown at 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone). The cell line expressing an IPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopy-ranoside; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane.-inducible form of H-Ras17N was obtained because long-term expression of this dominant-negative mutant can cause cell death in NIH 3T3 cells. The H-Ras17N protein was induced by treatment with 50 mm IPTG for 16 h before labeling (35Klinghoffer R.A. Duckworth B. Valius M. Cantley L. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This induction period had previously been shown to avoid such toxicity while allowing accumulation of low but useful amounts of protein. Radiolabeling and Immunoprecipitation—Palmitate incorporation was measured by incubating confluent cells with 0.5–1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in medium containing nonessential amino acids, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 25 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 10% calf serum (36Mumby S.M. Buss J.E. Methods (Orlando). 1990; 1: 216-220Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Labeling was stopped at times described by rinsing cells twice with Tris-buffered saline and lysing cells in a high SDS-RIPA buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1% aprotinin (Calbiochem), 1% Na-deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 0.5% SDS). Depalmitoylation was measured by labeling cells for 3 h, then incubating for varying times in similar but non-radioactive medium containing 200 μm palmitic acid (Sigma). After radiolabeling, cultures were rinsed and lysed directly in high SDS-RIPA buffer for immunoprecipitation. Although the polypeptide chain of H-Ras has a half-life of >24 h (37Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar), a property that has little effect during short chase times, [3H]palmitate values for both short and long chase periods were corrected for the amount of H-Ras protein remaining after immunoprecipitation, as detected by immunoblotting (see below). Extracts of whole cell fractions were incubated on ice for 1 h with a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for H-Ras (146–3E4, Quality Biotech) and collected using fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin; Calbiochem) coated with goat anti-mouse heavy and light chain IgG. The H-Ras17N mutant had a hemagglutinin epitope tag, so that its apparent size on the SDS-PAGE gel shifted to ∼23 kDa. This allowed the H-Ras17N to be analyzed separately from endogenous H-Ras, which has an apparent size of 21 kDa. The amount of palmitate on endogenous H-Ras was too low to quantify in pulse-chase experiments. The immunoprecipitates were washed, resuspended in special electrophoresis sample buffer with lowered amounts of dithiothreitol and without β-mercaptoethanol (2% SDS, 10 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue), resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and, as needed, sprayed with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for fluorography or developed with antibody for immunoblot analysis. Membranes were exposed to film for 3–40 days at -70 °C and the resulting images of palmitoylated H-Ras were quantified using densitometry and the program ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Calculations—As seen previously (38Baker T.L. Booden M.A. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22037-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 39Lu J.-Y. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7251-7256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), when plotted on a logarithmic scale, the data did not form a straight line, indicating that a simple exponential decay did not adequately describe the process of palmitate removal (data not shown). The mathematical form that produced the best fit to the data for each of the H-Ras proteins was determined using the Prism GraphPad statistics program. The equation chosen was a two-phase exponential decay line (Y = Span 1· exp(-K1·X) + Span 2·exp(-K2·X) + plateau), which starts at Span 1 + Span 2 + plateau and decays to plateau with rate constants K1 and K2. The half-life of palmitate reported here is the calculated time that would be needed to remove 50% of the original [3H]palmitate (t½) if the decrease were to occur solely at the initial rate, and is equal to 0.69/K1 with Span 1 = 0.5. GTP/GDP Determination—Confluent cultures of NIH 3T3 cells were grown overnight in 1% calf serum. Cells were then incubated with 0.5–1 mCi/ml [32P]inorganic phosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h in phosphate-free medium containing 1% calf serum (40Gibbs J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). H-Ras immunoprecipitates were formed with either monoclonal antibodies 146-3E4 (Quality Biotech) or Y13-259 (Calbiochem). The 146-3E4 antibody was found to isolate H-Ras more efficiently than Y13-259, but the proportions of GTP and GDP were similar with either antibody (data not shown). Labeled nucleotides were eluted from the immunoprecipitates, separated by thin layer chromatography, detected by autoradiography, and quantified using densitometry (41DeVries-Smits A.M. Voorn V.D. Downward J. Bos J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The percentages of Ras-bound nucleotide that is GTP (the average of three to four experiments) were calculated by using the equation (% with GTP) = (GTP)/(GTP + (1.5 GDP)). The GTP content of the 17N protein was not determined because the amount of IPTG-induced 17N protein was small and the anticipated percentages of GTP binding very low. Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—For preparation of soluble and crude membrane-containing fractions, NIH 3T3 cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (1 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% aprotinin (Calbiochem), with 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin (Roche Diagnostics)) by Dounce homogenization. The ionic strength was adjusted to 0.15 m NaCl, and the sample was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Proteins in the cytosolic fraction (S100) were precipitated with 4 volumes of ice-cold acetone. Equal portions of both the precipitated soluble proteins and particulate fraction (P100) were solubilized in electrophoresis sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gels, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and selected proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Density Gradients—Completely detergent-free density gradients were based on previous protocols (42Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 43Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), with the following major steps: cells were lysed in the hypotonic buffer as above by passage through a 26-gauge needle, nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation, then cytosol was removed, and crude membranes were collected by sedimentation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The P100 pellet was resuspended in gradient buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma number P-8340)) and homogenized by passage 15 times through a 26-gauge needle. The homogenized sample was further subjected to five rounds of sonication at 15 watt output (model VC 130, Sonics & Materials, Inc.), each consisting of five 1-s pulses with a 30-s cooling break with both sample and probe in ice. A portion of the sonicated sample (300 μl) was mixed with 2 volumes of 60% Optiprep (Sigma number d-1556) to produce a 40% Optiprep concentration, then overlain with a total of 4.2 ml of decreasing concentrations from 37.5 to 20% of Optiprep diluted with gradient buffer. The gradient was then subjected to centrifugation at 30,000 rpm (Beckman SW55 rotor), 4 °C over 16 h. Fractions (600 μl) were collected from the top of the tube, concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and probed with H-Ras, transferrin receptor or caveolin antibodies by immunoblotting. To examine the proteins separated by the neutral, detergent-free gradient, the entire fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. Similar neutral pH Optiprep gradients were also used for samples pretreated with 0.15 m sodium carbonate buffer (19Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43300-43304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pretreatment consisted of incubating the samples at pH 11 for 10 min on ice, sonication as above, then immediate neutralization by addition of 1/3 volume of 0.5 m MES buffer (pH 5.0), and confirming that the solution had been adjusted to pH 7.5. Detergent-treated samples were prepared starting from the P100 as above, but pretreatment consisted of resuspending the P100 in gradient buffer containing 1 or 0.1% Triton X-100, on ice, for 30 min. Gradients were prepared as above, with Triton-treated samples were overlain with Optiprep gradient buffer, without Triton (15Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Proteins collected by trichloroacetic acid, acetone precipitation, or immunoprecipitation were resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubating the membrane in 1.25% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline overnight. Membranes were probed with the H-Ras-specific mouse monoclonal antibody, 146-3E4 (Quality Biotech), a rabbit antibody to caveolin-1 (C13630, Transduction Laboratories), or mouse antibody to the transferrin receptor (Zymed Labs). For [3H]palmitate-labeled samples, biotinylated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, Vector Laboratories) were used with detection by alkaline phosphatase (Vector Laboratories) using the manufacturer's protocol. The amounts of radioactive palmitate bound to the H-Ras protein were quantified along with the amount of H-Ras protein in each sample to correct each fluorographic signal for variations in protein recovery in the immunoprecipitates. For density gradient samples, horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, Pierce) were used with detection by chemiluminescence (Pierce 34080). Sonication and Immunofluorescence of Membrane Fragments—NIH 3T3 cells were plated in 12-well culture cassettes on glass coverslips (18 mm) coated with 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma). Two days later the cells were processed, on ice, as described (44Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 45Mumby S.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 383-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) in a sonication buffer that contained GDP/MgCl2 with the sonication probe placed 12 mm above the coverslip and sonicated for a 1-s burst at 4 watts using the Sonics Vibra Cell ultrasonic processor and washed in ice-cold sonication buffer. Samples were fixed with fresh 4% formaldehyde on ice and quenched with 50 mm ammonium chloride, then incubated with blocking buffer (2% horse serum and 0.4% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline). Sonicated cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-H-Ras (Y13-238, 1:500 dilution, 0.5 μg/ml) and anti-caveolin (C13630, 1:400 dilution, 0.625 μg/ml, Transduction Laboratories) diluted in the blocking buffer. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG from Molecular Probes) were diluted 1:700 in blocking buffer, to 2.8 μg/ml. The slips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and photographed using a ×100 oil immersion lens on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with Spot RT digital camera (Roche Diagnostics). Images were captured in color, imported into and overlaid using Adobe Photoshop. The alignment control was incubated as above using the polyclonal anti-caveolin and both a green Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit serum and red Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit serum and showed 100% alignment (data not shown). Palmitate Removal on Oncogenic H-Ras Is Faster Than on Cellular H-Ras—We undertook a detailed examination of H-Ras palmitate labeling, turnover, and GTP binding in NIH 3T3 cells, a cell line in which effector pathway connections and consequences for transforming activity of H-Ras were well studied. A pulse-chase technique was used to examine the rates of palmitate removal/replacement in NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing the cellular (WT) form of H-Ras or the activated, oncogenic 61L protein. Cells were labeled for 3 h with [3H]palmitate, then incubated for the indicated times in medium containing non-radioactive palmitate. As palmitate addition is a post-translational modification, cycloheximide can be included in the medium, to prevent synthesis of new protein that might become palmitoylated during the experiment. Thus only removal of palmitate from previously synthesized and palmitoylated H-Ras was detected during the chase. Results of these pulse-chase experiments showed that the 61L protein lost [3H]palmitate rapidly, with a decrease to less than half its initial value within 1 h (Fig. 1). In contrast, palmitate on the WT protein was removed more slowly, and still retained almost all of its initial palmitate content after 2 h (Fig. 1). To determine whether another oncogenic form of H-Ras would display a similar rapid rate of palmitate removal, cells expressing a H-Ras12R,59T (v-H-Ras) protein were tested (Fig. 1). This second activated protein also displayed a rapid decrease in the amount of radioactive palmitate, which remained attached, with more than half of the [3H]palmitate being lost in 2 h. To test if a second H-Ras protein that would be largely GDP-bound, similar to the cellular H-RasWT, might show a slow rate of palmitate removal, a 17N mutant of H-Ras was analyzed. The S17N point mutation causes the protein to accumulate in the inactive GDP-bound form (35Klinghoffer R.A. Duckworth B. Valius M. Cantley L. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Over the time course of the label and chase, no changes in cell morphology or cell death in the induced H-Ras17N cultures were observed (data not shown). Experiments performed on IPTG-treated NIH 3T3 cells expressing this H-Ras17N indicated that palmitate on the GDP-bound 17N mutant was removed slowly, with very little [3H]palmitate signal being removed after 2 h (Fig. 1). Thus, two oncogenic forms of H-Ras had faster rates of palmitate removal and two predominantly GDP-bound forms of H-Ras had slower rates of removal. Because H-Ras has two sites of palmitoylation and only a small amount of palmitate was removed in the short pulse-chase experiments, the chase period was extended to 24 h. The results showed, as had been seen previously (38Baker T.L. Booden M.A. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22037-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 39Lu J.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W1969439607,"The pro-apoptotic “BH3 domain-only” proteins of the Bcl-2 family (e.g. Bid and Bad) transduce multiple death signals to the mitochondrion. They interact with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and induce apoptosis by a mechanism that requires the presence of at least one of the multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins Bax or Bak. Although the BH3 domain of Bid can promote the pro-apoptotic assembly and function of Bax/Bak by itself, other BH3 domains do not function as such. The latter point raises the question of whether, and how, these BH3 domains induce apoptosis. We show here that a peptide comprising the minimal BH3 domain from Bax induces apoptosis but is unable to stimulate the apoptotic activity of microinjected recombinant Bax. This relies on the inability of the peptide to directly induce Bax translocation to mitochondria or a change in its conformation. This peptide nevertheless interferes with Bax/Bcl-xL interactions in vitro and stimulates the apoptotic activity of Bax when combined with Bcl-xL. Similarly, a peptide derived from the BH3 domain of Bad stimulates Bax activity only in the presence of Bcl-xL. Thus, BH3 domains do not necessarily activate multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins directly but promote apoptosis by releasing active multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins from their anti-apoptotic counterparts.

Similarly, a peptide derived from the BH3 domain of Bad stimulates Bax activity only in the presence of Bcl-xL. Thus, BH3 domains do not necessarily activate multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins directly but promote apoptosis by releasing active multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins from their anti-apoptotic counterparts. Apoptosis is a highly regulated process of cell demise triggered by internal or external stimuli. Most apoptotic signaling pathways converge on the mitochondrion and lead to a change in the mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (1Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). As a result, diverse apoptogenic proteins, such as cytochrome c (which allows the activation of a caspase 9/caspase-3 cascade via the cytosolic adapter Apaf-1), Smac/DIABLO, “apoptosis-inducing factor,” endonuclease G, and HtrA2, are released from this organelle. The response of the mitochondrion to upstream stimuli is a critical control point in the regulation of apoptosis. It is crucial, therefore, to understand how this organelle integrates a great variety of death signals. Bcl-2 family members are major regulators of mitochondrial integrity (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4802) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL display sequence conservation throughout all four Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1–4), whereas the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak possess homology in BH1–3 domains. These multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins have the innate ability to alter mitochondrial integrity, possibly via their ability to induce channels in the mitochondrial membrane (3Degterev A. Boyce M. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ratio between anti-apoptotic and multidomain pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members helps determine the cellular susceptibility to death stimulation (4Oltvai Z. Milliman C. Korsmeyer S. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). NMR structural analysis of the Bcl-xL-BakBH3 peptide complex has revealed that the BH3 domain of Bak binds to a hydrophobic cleft formed by the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of Bcl-xL (5Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic and multidomain pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members may thus engage, by a BH3 domain-dependent mechanism, in the formation of heterodimers in which they mutually antagonize each other's function (6Degterev A. Lugovskoy A. Cardone M. Mulley B. Wagner G. Mitchison T. Yuan J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family includes a third subgroup of pro-apoptotic members that display sequence homology only with the BH3 domain (7Kelekar A. Thompson C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). These BH3 only proteins seem to act as the afferent effectors of various pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals (8Hunt A. Evan G. Science. 2001; 293: 1784-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For instance, both Noxa and Puma are transcriptionally regulated by p53 (9Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar), whereas the activity of Bad is negatively regulated by the Akt/protein kinase B survival signaling pathway (14Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar). Murine cells lacking both multidomain Bax and Bak display long term resistance to mitochondrial damage and cell death induced by all BH3-only proteins tested (15Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.

Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Thus, in mammals, activation of BH3 only proteins integrate diverse apoptotic stimuli into one single pathway by triggering Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. All BH3-only proteins have the ability to bind to and to functionally antagonize anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (8Hunt A. Evan G. Science. 2001; 293: 1784-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain-dependent mechanism by which Bax/Bak pro-apoptotic function is recruited remains poorly characterized. Indeed, multidomain proteins, in viable cells, reside as inactive proteins located either at the mitochondria (Bak) or in the cytosol (Bax) (18Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). The direct binding of Bid to either Bax or Bak is sufficient to activate those proteins and allow their pro-apoptotic assembly in the mitochondrial membrane (19Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 20Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Very recent evidence (22Letai A. Bassik M. Walensky L. Sorcinelli M. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar, 23Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) using synthetic peptides has indicated that the BidBH3 domain itself functions as a specific death ligand. These studies nevertheless revealed evidence for another functional subset of BH3 domains, which lack the ability to activate directly Bax/Bak but retain the ability to bind to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (22Letai A. Bassik M. Walensky L. Sorcinelli M. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). It has remained unclear whether such BH3 domains can induce apoptosis and, if so, by which mechanism. To explore this question further, we have analyzed in this study the apoptotic effects of a minimal BH3 domain synthetic peptide, comprising the critical 16 residues of the defined Bax BH3 domain (BaxBH3 (57–72)). These 16 residues contain sufficient information to bind to (5Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar), and functionally antagonize (24Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Brown L. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), Bcl-xL and to induce specifically Bax/Bak-mediated apoptosis (24Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Brown L. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We show here that, despite these properties, BaxBH3 cannot efficiently induce Bax translocation to mitochondria, evoke a change in Bax conformation, nor stimulate the apoptotic activity of recombinant Bax, whereas it can stimulate that of a mutant form of Bax that exhibits an increased ability to homodimerize. BaxBH3 interferes with Bax/Bcl-xL interactions in cell-free experiments and stimulates the apoptotic activity of Bax combined with Bcl-xL. Similarly, a peptide derived from the BH3 domain of Bad was also unable to stimulate Bax activity by itself but cooperated with Bcl-xL to activate it. Taken together, these data support a model in which BH3 peptides that mainly act as antagonists of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members can induce apoptosis by interfering with the interaction between multidomain pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Reagents and Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody 6H2B4 from Pharmingen; polyclonal anti-Bax BaxNT antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; and monoclonal anti-Bax 2D2 and 6A7 antibodies from R & D Systems. The polyclonal anti-Bax TL41 antibody was raised against the BH3 domain of Bax (residues 57–72) (24Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Brown L. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescent Alexa 568™-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes. Unless indicated, all other reagents used in this study were obtained from Sigma. Peptides and Recombinant Proteins—The high pressure liquid chromatography-purified BaxBH3 (KKLSECLKRIGDELDS), BaxBH3 L63A (KKLSECAKRIGDELDS), and BadBH3 (QRYGRELRRMSDEFVD) peptides were obtained from Genosys (Cambridge, UK). Histidine-tagged human Baxα, BaxΔART, and Bcl-xL were obtained by subcloning of the coding regions into pDEST17 plasmid (Gateway, Invitrogen) as described previously (25Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). His-tagged proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain XL-1 blue and purified by chromatography on nickel-Sepharose acid resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant proteins were dialyzed against PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FCS, fetal calf serum; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; IVTR, in vitro translated radiolabeled; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and stored at -80 °C until used. The purification of GST, GST-Bcl-xL, and tBid from bacterial lysates has been described previously (24Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Brown L. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 26von Ahsen O. Renken C. Perkins G. Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Microinjection Experiments—Rat-1 fibroblasts, grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 0.1 mm glutamine, were seeded on sterile coverslips the day prior to microinjection. Microinjection was performed as described previously (27Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) using an InjectMan NI2 micromanipulator and a FemtoJet injector from Eppendorf (Germany). Identical, standardized conditions of pressure (100 hPa) and time (0.1 s) were used in all experiments. Peptides and/or recombinant proteins were diluted in PBS together with dextran 70 kDa-conjugated lysine-fixable Oregon Green® (Molecular Probes, 0.5% final concentration) as a co-injection marker. Typically, 100 cells were microinjected for each condition in each experiment. The percentage of positive (i.e. fluorescent) cells exhibiting morphological features of apoptosis following microinjection was evaluated as described previously (27Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) using an inverted fluorescence microscope (DMIRE2, Leica, France). Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemical staining of microinjected cells was performed as described previously (24Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Brown L. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both the primary polyclonal anti-Bax NT antibody and the anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution. Images presented in this study were collected on a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope with a 100 × 1.3 NA Fluotar objective (Leica, France). Cell-free Assays—Mitochondria were isolated from normal rat liver as described previously (28Tremblais K. Oliver L. Juin P. Le Cabellec T.M. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For mitochondrial targeting assays, [35S]Met-labeled proteins (Amersham Biosciences) were synthesized from cDNAs using the TnT-coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega, France) and quantified as described previously (28Tremblais K. Oliver L. Juin P. Le Cabellec T.M. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Bax (4 fmol) was incubated with isolated mitochondria (2.5 mg proteins/ml) and with the indicated concentration of recombinant tBid or BaxBH3 at 30 °C for 1 h in 40 μl of standard import buffer (250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2,10mm malic acid, 8 mm succinic acid, 1 mm ATP-Mg2+, 20 mm MOPS, pH7.5). When indicated, 35S-Bax was preincubated with unlabeled GST or GST-Bcl-xL (2 fmol) for 30 min prior to incubation with mitochondria in the presence or in the absence of BaxBH3 (200 nm). Radiolabeled proteins bound to the mitochondria were recovered by centrifugation of the incubation mixture at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by scanning with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) followed by quantification with IPLab gel program (Signal Analytics). For cytochrome c release assays, recombinant Baxα (5 nm) was preincubated with either GST or GST-BclxL (2.5 nm) for 30 min prior to its incubation with mitochondria (1 mg of proteins/ml) in the absence or in the presence of BaxBH3 (200 nm) for an additional hour in 100 μl of import buffer. Mitochondria were then recovered, and the amount of mitochondrial cytochrome c was analyzed by Western blotting and quantified with IPLab gel program (Signal Analytics). Protein Binding Experiments—In vitro His-protein binding assays were performed as described previously (25Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, each radiolabeled protein (4 or 8 fmol as indicated) was incubated with an equimolar concentration of either His-tagged Bcl-xL or Baxα immobilized on nickel-Sepharose in 50 μl of binding buffer (142 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of other protease inhibitors) at 4 °C for 2 h. BaxBH3 or BaxBH3 L63A (200 nm final concentration) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional hour. Protein complexes were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed three times in binding buffer, eluted in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 mm imidazole), separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed with a PhosphorImager as described above. For mild proteolysis experiments, both the pellet and the supernatant from the first centrifugation at 13,000 × g were treated with trypsin (1 mg/ml) for 15 min at 4 °C. Proteolysis was then stopped by the addition of 10 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor prior to analysis as described above. To assess directly the sensitivity of radiolabeled Bax to trypsin treatment in the absence of His-tagged Bcl-xL, the radiolabeled protein (8 fmol) was incubated with tBid (8 fmol, 0.2 nm final concentration), the indicated peptides (200 nm), or was left untreated in 40 μl of binding buffer for 1 h at 30 °C prior to trypsin treatment as described above. For immunoprecipitation experiments, soluble His-tagged Bcl-xL-radiolabeled Bax complexes were prepared as follows. Radiolabeled Bax (20 fmol) was incubated with 20 fmol of His tagged Bcl-xL immobilized on nickel-Sepharose in 250 μl of binding buffer at 4 °C for 2 h; protein complexes were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed three times in binding buffer, and then eluted in 20 μl of elution buffer. SDS-PAGE analysis and quantification using a PhosphorImager as described above showed that the resulting soluble complexes contained in average 4 fmol of radiolabeled Bax. These soluble complexes, or equivalent amounts of free radiolabeled Bax (4 fmol), were incubated with an equimolar amount of tBid (0.2 nm final concentration) or with the indicated peptides (200 nm) for 1 h at 30 °C in 40 μl of standard import buffer. The anti-Bax 2D2, 6A7, or TL41 antibodies were then added (1:10 final dilution) for an additional 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Antibody-protein complexes were then isolated by incubation with either Zysorbin-G (for the 6A7 and 2D2 antibodies) or Zysorbin (for the TL41 antibody) followed by centrifugation and washes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). SDS-PAGE analysis and quantification of the immunoprecipitated and radiolabeled proteins using a PhosphorImager were performed as described above. BaxBH3 Does Not Stimulate the Cytotoxic Activity of Wild Type Bax—In order to investigate the mechanism of action of BH3 domains, we used a synthetic peptide comprising the known BH3 domain of Bax (residues 57–72), BaxBH3. This peptide interacts with (5Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar), and functionally antagonizes (24Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Brown L. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), Bcl-xL. Moreover, upon microinjection into fibroblasts, it induces apoptosis by a mechanism that requires either Bax or Bak (24Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Brown L. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). One possible reason for this is that this peptide directly activates the multidomain proteins, essentially acting as a death ligand (22Letai A. Bassik M. Walensky L. Sorcinelli M. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). This notion appears consistent with its reported ability to interact physically with full-length Bax (29Cosulich S.C. Worrall V. Hedge P.J. Green S. Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 913-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if BaxBH3 can directly activate Bax, it should be more efficient in inducing apoptosis in cells with increased Bax levels; on the other hand, we would expect to see no increased sensitivity to BaxBH3 in these cells if BaxBH3 were unable to stimulate Bax function directly. We therefore made use of a recombinant full-length Bax (Baxα) and assessed its effect on whole intact cells in the presence or in the absence of the BaxBH3 peptide. The recombinant protein used was prepared in the absence of detergent, in order to prevent the artifactual activation of Bax reported to occur during the purification procedure (30Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). This purified Baxα protein did not associate with Baxα in cell-free experiments ((25Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) see also Fig. 6). It is therefore unlikely to adopt a homodimeric structure. As shown in Fig. 1 (top left panel), microinjection of recombinant Baxα (0.5 nm) induced limited apoptosis even 4 h following injection. In order to check that this recombinant protein can be activated by certain stimuli, we co-injected Baxα with a recombinant protein equivalent to the caspase 8 cleavage product of Bid (tBid, 0.5 nm) (26von Ahsen O. Renken C. Perkins G. Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This led to far more widespread apoptosis than that observed upon microinjection of either Baxα or tBid alone (Fig. 1, top right panel). Apoptotic synergy between these two proteins was evident as early as 2 h after microinjection, strongly supporting the view that recombinant Baxα by itself is poorly apoptogenic but can be activated by signals such as Bid activation. Of note, the fact that subnanomolar quantities of tBid and Baxα efficiently induced apoptosis is consistent with a previous report (31Madesh M. Antonsson B. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Hajnoczky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5651-5659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) showing that similar concentrations of tBid elicit significant mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.Fig. 1Effect of BaxBH3 on the pro-apoptotic activity of Baxα His-tagged recombinant Baxα (0.5 nm), tBid (0.5 nm alone or together with 0.5 nm Baxα), BaxBH3 (0.5 nm alone or together with 0.5 nm Baxα), and BaxBH3 L63A (0.5 nm alone or together with 0.5 nm Baxα) were mixed with Oregon Green dextran (0.5% w/v) in PBS and microinjected into Rat-1 fibroblasts, grown in 10% FCS. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C, and death of microinjected cells was assessed morphologically by fluorescence microscopy at the indicated times. Data are means (±S.E.) of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then analyzed whether BaxBH3 stimulated the pro-apoptotic function of Baxα. Microinjection of 0.5 nm BaxBH3 induced apoptosis to a certain degree (Fig. 1, bottom left panel), whereas microinjection of the mutant BaxBH3 L63A (0.5 nm), which does not interact with Bcl-xL, had only a limited effect on cell viability (Fig. 1, bottom right panel). In sharp contrast to what we observed for tBid, co-injection of Baxα and BaxBH3 did not result in an increased apoptosis in the microinjected cells (Fig. 1, bottom left panel). A similar lack of effect on Baxα activity was observed with the mutant BaxBH3 L63A peptide (Fig. 1, bottom right panel). Thus, BaxBH3 induces apoptosis, but it does not impact on the apoptotic activity of the native form of Bax. BaxBH3 Neither Stimulates Bax Association with Mitochondria nor Significantly Modifies Its Conformation—Bax in its native conformation is only poorly targeted to mitochondria, and it acquires the ability to interact with its mitochondrial site of action only in response to certain death stimuli, including Bid activation (32Ruffolo S.C. Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Goping I.S. Gross A. Korsmeyer S.J. Li H. Yuan J. Shore G.C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the lack of effect of BaxBH3 on Baxα apoptotic function depended upon its inability to stimulate Baxα targeting to mitochondria. For this purpose, we used an in vitro system employing the 35S-labeled transcription-translation product of Bax cDNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate together with purified mitochondria from rat liver. Previous analysis of Bax association with mitochondria in such a system has confirmed that Bax targeting to mitochondria is mostly inefficient but that it can be triggered by addition of cytosolic extracts from apoptotic cells (28Tremblais K. Oliver L. Juin P. Le Cabellec T.M. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Nomura M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Narita M. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5542-5548PubMed Google Scholar) or induced by specific mutations that serve to increase Bax apoptotic activity (25Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we checked that the addition of low concentrations (1–10 nm) of tBid stimulated the targeting of in vitro translated, radiolabeled (IVTR) Baxα to isolated mitochondria in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In sharp contrast, the addition of BaxBH3 at 10 nm did not stimulate Baxα association to mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Increased concentrations of the peptide, up to 10 μm, failed to exhibit any effect on Baxα targeting (not shown, see also below in Fig. 5). We conclude that BaxBH3 is unable to stimulate Baxα association to mitochondria.Fig. 5Effect of either BaxBH3 or BadBH3 on Bax pro-apoptotic activity in the presence of Bcl-xL.A, the indicated combination of Baxα (0.5 nm), GST-Bcl-xL (0.25 nm), GST(0.25 nm), and BaxBH3 (0.5 nm) were mixed with Oregon Green dextran (0.5% w/v) in PBS and microinjected into Rat-1 fibroblasts, grown in 10% FCS. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C, and cell death in the microinjected population was assayed as in Fig. 1. Data are means (±S.E.) of three independent experiments. B, experiments were performed as in A using BadBH3 instead of BaxBH3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of certain stimuli, such as Bid activation, to induce translocation of Bax to mitochondria has been ascribed to their ability to induce a change in Bax conformation. Such change in Bax is accompanied by the exposure of an epitope located in its N terminus, which can be detected in whole cells by immunohistochemical analysis with a specific antibody (BaxNT (35Perez D.

The role of Stat5 in breast cancer has not been established, although Stat5 is critical for some hematopoietic malignancies. We detected for the first time that Stat5b is constitutively activated in human breast cancer cell lines, and analysed the role of Stat5 in estrogen receptor(ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines using dominant-negative variants of Stat5. Two distinct carboxyl-truncated Stat5a derivatives were generated. Stat5aΔ740 corresponded to a naturally occurring alternative splice variant, and Stat5aΔ713 was analogous to an 80 kDa Stat5a product of a nuclear protease. Stat5aΔ740 and Stat5aΔ713 displayed comparable dominant-negative properties and suppressed transcriptional activity of wild-type Stat5a and Stat5b equally well. Cotransfection experiments revealed that Stat5aΔ740 completely blocked transcriptional activity of endogenous estrogen receptor in T47D and MCF7 cells, and of both ERα and ERβ in COS-7 cells. Stat5aΔ740 was selected for adenoviral delivery, and high-efficiency expression of tyrosine phosphorylated Stat5aΔ740 was achieved in infected cells. Adenoviral-mediated Stat5aΔ740 induced apoptosis in T47D cells but not in caspase-3-negative MCF7 cells. The present study indicates that overexpression of a dominant-negative variant of Stat5 suppresses ER transcriptional activity and induces apoptosis in estrogen-responsive breast cancer tissue culture cells."
https://openalex.org/W2034921169,"Growth hormone (GH) promotes signaling by causing activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, JAK2, which associates with the GH receptor. GH causes phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB-1) and its family member, ErbB-2. For EGFR, JAK2-mediated GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation may allow EGFR to serve as a scaffold for GH signaling. For ErbB-2, GH induces serine/threonine phosphorylation that dampens basal and EGF-induced ErbB-2 kinase activation. We now further explore GH-induced EGFR phosphorylation in 3T3-F442A, a preadipocytic fibroblast cell line that expresses endogenous GH receptor, EGFR, and ErbB-2. Using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes ERK consensus site phosphorylation (PTP101), we found that GH caused PTP101-reactive phosphorylation of EGFR. This GH-induced EGFR phosphorylation was prevented by MEK1 inhibitors but not by a protein kinase C inhibitor. Although GH did not discernibly affect EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, we observed by immunoblotting a substantial decrease of EGF-induced EGFR degradation in the presence of GH. Fluorescence microscopy studies indicated that EGF-induced intracellular redistribution of an EGFR-cyan fluorescent protein chimera was markedly reduced by GH cotreatment, in support of the immunoblotting results. Notably, protection from EGF-induced degradation and inhibition of EGF-induced intracellular redistribution afforded by GH were both prevented by a MEK1 inhibitor, suggesting a role for GH-induced ERK activation in regulating the trafficking itinerary of the EGF-stimulated EGFR. Finally, we observed augmentation of early aspects of EGF signaling (EGF-induced ERK2 activation and EGF-induced Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation) by GH cotreatment; the GH effect on EGF-induced Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation was also prevented by MEK1 inhibition.

GH exerts its profound somatogenic and metabolic regulatory effects by interacting with the GH receptor (GHR), a cell surface glycoprotein member of the cytokine receptor superfamily (1Leung D.W.

Like other cytokine receptors, the GHR initiates its signal transduction by physical and functional association with JAK2, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase member of the JAK family (4Argetsinger L.S.

Other signaling pathways induced by GH include the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, both also targets of a variety of other growth factors and cytokines.GH induces activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in several model systems, including the murine 3T3-F442A preadipocyte fibroblast (7Anderson N.G.

In contrast to STAT5 activation, which requires the presence of the receptor cytoplasmic domain in addition to activation of JAK2, the ability of GH to activate ERKs appears to require none of the distal GHR tail and instead corresponds to whether it can promote JAK2 activation (9Moller C.

These studies suggest previously unrecognized cross-talk between the GHR and members of the EGFR family, examples of seemingly disparate types of signaling receptors (a cytokine receptor and a family of tyrosine kinase receptors, respectively). The EGFR family of structurally related transmembrane glycoproteins includes the EGFR itself (ErbB-1), ErbB-2 (cneu), ErbB-3, and ErbB-4 (22Alroy I Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 23Riese II, D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Except for ErbB-3, each has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in its cytoplasmic domain. Ligands such as EGF, transforming growth factor-α, and neuregulins induce signaling through these receptors by binding to specific EGFR family members in such a way as to promote particular homo- or heterodimers among the family members. ErbB-2 has no known ligand, but it is the preferred heterodimer partner for other family members when they engage their ligands. EGF, for example, promotes formation of EGFR homodimers or EGFR/ErbB-2 heterodimers and thus causes activation of both of these tyrosine kinases in cells that express them. EGF signaling through EGFR and ErbB-2 has a number of biologically relevant signaling outcomes in both normal and neoplastic cells.Yamauchi et al. (24Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Sekine N. Wada M. Honjo M. Takahashi M. Takahashi T. Hirai H. Tushima T. Akanuma Y. Fujita T. Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Nature. 1997; 39: 91-96Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that GH caused tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, both in vivo in the livers of mice and in cell culture. This GH-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was shown to require JAK2, but not EGFR, kinase activity. Partial mapping by mutagenesis suggested that EGFR Tyr-1068, which when phosphorylated resides in a consensus Grb-2 association motif, was a site of GH-induced phosphorylation and that GH caused enhanced EGFR-Grb-2 association. Further, GH-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was shown in cell culture to likely contribute to GH-induced ERK activation. Thus, this study suggested that EGFR may be a docking molecule involved in GH-induced, JAK2-dependent ERK activation. Our previous study (25Kim S.-O. Houtman J. Jiang J. Ruppert J.M. Bertics P.J. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36015-36024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in 3T3-F442A cells confirmed that GH caused EGFR kinase-independent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation but also suggested GH effects on ErbB-2. GH caused a decrease in basal and EGF-induced ErbB-2 tyrosine kinase activation and tyrosine phosphorylation that was associated with retardation of the electrophoretic migration of ErbB-2. This retarded migration was shown to be because of serine or threonine, rather than tyrosine, phosphorylation of ErbB-2, and both the GH-induced change in migration and inhibited tyrosine kinase activation were prevented by blocking GH-induced ERK activation. These findings suggested that GH caused an ERK pathway-dependent phosphorylation of ErbB2 that rendered it desensitized to activation in response to EGF.We now explore further the mechanisms and consequences of cross-talk between GH and EGF signaling. In particular, we examine GH-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB-2. Our findings suggest that GH causes an ERK pathway-dependent threonine phosphorylation of both ErbB-2 and EGFR that is recognized by a state-specific antibody reactive with ERK consensus phosphorylation sites. In contrast to our findings for ErbB-2, we observe that this GH-induced EGFR phosphorylation does not significantly alter the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activation of EGFR, but instead slows the rate of EGF-induced EGFR intracellular redistribution and degradation, thereby potentiating EGF-induced EGFR signaling. These results suggest that GH may affect EGF signaling by multiple mechanisms, including modulation of EGF-induced EGFR trafficking.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant human GH was kindly provided by Lilly. Recombinant human EGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and recombinant human PDGF-BB was from Intergen (Purchase, NY). Murine 125I-EGF (150–200 μCi/μg) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PMA was obtained from Sigma. The PKC inhibitor, GF109203X (Calbiochem), and the MEK1 inhibitors, PD98059 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and U0126 (Promega, Madison, WI), were purchased commercially.Antibodies—Polyclonal anti-ErbB-2, anti-EGFR, and anti-Cbl-b antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal anti-phospho-threonine-proline antibody PTP101, polyclonal anti-phospho-EGFR antibodies Tyr-845, Tyr-992, Tyr-1045, and Tyr-1068 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-active mitogen-activated protein kinase affinity-purified rabbit antibody (anti-active ERK, recognizing the dually phosphorylated Thr-183 and Tyr-185 residues corresponding to the active forms of ERK1 and ERK2; Promega, Madison, WI), monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10, anti-mitogenactivated protein kinase affinity-purified rabbit antibody (recognizing both ERK1 and ERK2), polyclonal anti-PDGFR antibody (recognizing both PDGF type A and B receptors), and monoclonal anti-phospho-EGFR antibody Tyr-1173 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were all purchased commercially.Cell Culture and Transfection—3T3-F442A cells (26Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Drs. H. Green (Harvard University, Boston, MA) and C. Carter-Su (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (Cellgro, Inc.), supplemented with 10% calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Biofluids, Rockville, MD). 3T3-L1 cells from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were grown in the above medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) instead of 10% calf serum.To generate stable 3T3-L1 transfectants expressing the CFP-tagged EGFR (EGFR-CFP), cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and used at 50–80% confluency. The plasmid pCFP/EGFR, kindly provided by Dr. L. Samelson, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, encodes the human EGFR with the CFP fused to its C terminus (27Yamazaki T. Zaal K. Hailey D. Presley J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Samelson L.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1791-1802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCFP/EGFR was transfected into 3T3-L1 cells using GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA) as described previously (28Boney C.M. Sekimoto H. Gruppuso P.A. Frackelton A.R. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 379-386PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 cells expressing EGFR-CFP were selected in 1 mg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) and cloned. Transfectants were maintained in culture medium containing 200 μg/ml of G418.Cell Starvation, Inhibitor Pretreatment, Cell Stimulation, and Protein Extraction—Serum starvation of 3T3-F442A or 3T3-L1 cells was accomplished by substitution of 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V: Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for calf serum or fetal bovine serum in the culture medium for 16–20 h prior to experiments. Pretreatments and stimulations were carried out at 37 °C in binding buffer (consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dextrose). Serum-starved cells were pretreated with PD98059 (100 μm), U0126 (10 μm), GF109203X (1 μm), or vehicle (as a control) for 30 or 60 min prior to treatment with GH (500 ng/ml), EGF (1 nm), PMA (1 μg/ml), PDGF (40 ng/ml), or vehicle, as specified in each experiment. Stimulations were terminated by washing the cells once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate (PBS-vanadate) and then harvested by scraping in PBS-vanadate. Cells were collected by brief centrifugation, and pelleted cells were solubilized for 15 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the detergent extracts (supernatant) were subjected to immunoprecipitation or were directly electrophoresed and immunoblotted, as indicated below. For examining the abundance of EGFR and ErbB-2, total cell lysates were extracted in the presence of 1% SDS.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts (500–1000 μg) were mixed with 5 μl of polyclonal anti-ErbB-2, -EGFR, -PDGFR, or -Cbl-b antibody (1 μg) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous agitation. Protein A-Sepharose (20 μl) (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. Laemmli sample buffer eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as indicated below.Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and incubated with primary antibodies (0.5–1 μg/ml) as specified in each experiment. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution) and washed. The bound antibodies were detected with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Membrane stripping was performed according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Amersham Biosciences).Densitometric Analysis—Densitometry of immunoblots was performed using a solid state video camera (Sony-77; Sony Corp.) and a 28-mm MicroNikkor lens over a light box of variable intensity (Northern Light Precision 890; Imaging Research, Inc., Toronto, Canada). Quantification was performed using a Macintosh II-based image analysis program (Image 1.49, developed by W. S. Rasband; Research Services Branch, NIMH, Bethesda, MD). Pooled data from several experiments are displayed as mean ± S.E. The significance (p value) of differences of pooled results was estimated using unpaired t tests.To verify the fidelity of this densitometric method, we performed a control experiment in which total protein concentration of 3T3-F442A cell extract was determined using BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce), and serially diluted total protein aliquots (2.5–100 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-EGFR. Densitometry of the EGFR intensities plotted against the known loaded protein amounts yielded a straight line with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.97 (not shown). This suggested a high degree of reliability for this densitometric analysis.Fluorescence Microscopy—3T3-L1 transfectants expressing EGFRCFP were grown on Corning glass coverslips precoated with gelatin (Sigma) in 6-well plates for 48 h in culture medium until they reached ∼50% confluency. The cells were starved, pretreated with PD98059 (100 μm) or vehicle for 1 h, and stimulated with GH (500 ng/ml), EGF (1 nm), or vehicle as described above and specified in the experiment. The cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides (Fisher) in Vectorshield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence patterns were visualized with an Olympus fluorescence microscope at the University of Alabama Cell Biology Imaging Core Facility. Images were collected and analyzed using IPLab Spectrum software (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA).125I-EGF Internalization Experiments—3T3-F442A cells were grown in six-well plates in culture medium until they formed monolayers. The cells were starved and pretreated with GH (500 ng/ml) or vehicle in binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/l glucose, supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 10 min. To measure the internalization of 125I-EGF, the cells were incubated with 125I-EGF (1 ng/ml) in binding medium in the continued presence or absence of GH at 37 °C for 0–10 min in duplicate. At the end of incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the monolayers were rapidly washed twice with ice-cold binding medium to remove unbound ligand. The cells were then incubated with 0.2 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl at 4 °C for 5 min. The acid wash was combined with another short rinse in the same buffer and used to determine the amount of surface-bound 125I-EGF. The cells were finally lysed in 100 mm NaOH containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS to determine the amount of internalized 125I-EGF. Radioactivity was counted with a γ-counter. The acid-inaccessible internalized 125I-EGF was presented as a fraction of total cell-associated radioactivity (the sum of cell surface-bound and internalized 125I-EGF) at each time point. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled EGF and was not more than 5% of the total counts.RESULTSGH Acutely Promotes ERK-dependent Phosphorylation of EGFR at Sites Recognized by an ERK Phosphorylation Site Antibody—The murine 3T3-F442A fibroblast expresses EGFR and ErbB-2, as well as the receptor for GH (25Kim S.-O.

These effects of GH were inhibited by drugs that block activation of the MEK1/ERK pathway.To further characterize such serine/threonine phosphorylation of EGFR family members, we employed a state-specific monoclonal antibody (PTP101) that specifically detects proteins phosphorylated at the consensus site(s) for proline-directed protein kinases, such as the ERKs (31Pearson R.B.

In the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, serum-starved cells were exposed to GH, EGF, or vehicle (_) for 10 min prior to detergent extraction and immunoprecipitation with anti-ErbB-2 (lanes 1–3) or anti-EGFR (lanes 4–6) antibodies. Eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted sequentially with anti-ErbB-2 (upper panel, lanes 1–3), anti-EGFR (upper panel, lanes 4–6), antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (anti-pTyr; middle panel, lanes 1–6), and PTP101 (lower panel, lanes 1–6). Consistent with our previous findings (25Kim S.-O. Houtman J. Jiang J. Ruppert J.M. Bertics P.J. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36015-36024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), neither GH nor EGF acutely changed the abundance of ErbB2 or EGFR (upper panel, lanes 1–6), but both stimuli caused retardation in the SDS-PAGE migration of ErbB-2 (upper panel, lanes 1 and 3 versus 2). For EGF, this retarded migration was accompanied by an increase in ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (middle panel, lane 3 versus 2), whereas GH caused a decrease in ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (middle panel, lane 1 versus 2). As expected (24Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Sekine N. Wada M. Honjo M. Takahashi M. Takahashi T. Hirai H. Tushima T. Akanuma Y. Fujita T. Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T.

Notably, the immunoblot in the lower panel (lanes 1–6) revealed that GH and EGF promoted the appearance of forms of ErbB-2 and EGFR that were recognized by PTP101, suggesting phosphorylation at ERK consensus sites in those molecules. Indeed, immunoblotting of unfractionated cell extracts from the same cells with anti-active ERK antibodies confirmed that both GH and EGF promoted robust ERK activation in these cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3 versus 2). Interestingly, whereas GH promoted less EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation than did EGF, comparison of the GH- and EGF-induced PTP101 signals in Fig. 1A suggests that GH promoted substantially more EGFR ERK consensus site phosphorylation than did EGF.The data in Fig. 1 indicated that both GH and EGF caused phosphorylation of ErbB-2 and EGFR at potential ERK consensus sites, suggesting that this is mediated by activation of the ERK pathway by these stimuli. To further test this proposition, we employed inhibitors of MEK1, the upstream activator of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 2). Two separate inhibitors, PD98059 and the more potent U0126 (34Alessi D.R. Cuenda A.

The heterotrimer consists of Gα subunits that bind GDP/GTP and Gβγ subunits that form a hydrophobic complex. Upon activation by a receptor, the Gα subunit exchanges GDP for GTP and in this active state modulates effectors.

RGS proteins are a family of over 20 proteins that share significant homology in a domain called the RGS box that binds the Gα subunit (3Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 4De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Biol. 1999; 34: 215-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This family of proteins can be subdivided on the basis of other domains outside the RGS box. RGS16 shares significant homology with RGS4 and RGS5 and consists of short amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends on either side of the RGS box. RGS16 is expressed in several tissues including retina, pituitary, and liver (6Chen C.K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Chen C. Zheng B. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

Despite considerable knowledge about the in vitro function of RGS proteins, the intracellular regulation of these proteins is poorly understood.Several RGS proteins undergo palmitoylation, the reversible addition of palmitate to cysteine residues through a thioester bond (8Rose J.J.

Palmitoylation increases the hydrophobicity and stabilizes the membrane binding of proteins, but is not necessarily required for membrane attachment, as is the case for RGS16 and RGS4 (9Druey K.M.

Several RGS proteins have GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity for only the nonpalmitoylated form of Gα subunits (15Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, palmitoylation of RGS4 and RGS10 inhibits their GAP activity toward Gα-GTP in solution-based assays, but decreased and increased, respectively, agonist-stimulated GTPase activity in phospholipid vesicles containing a receptor and G-protein (13Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Acylation can also target proteins to membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (16Moffett S. Brown D.A. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2191-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). These microdomains, called lipid rafts, can be isolated by their resistance to cold, nonionic detergent extraction and buoyancy on gradient centrifugation. Compartmentalization of several signal transduction pathways and proteins, including G-proteins, occurs in lipid rafts (18Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar, 19Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar, 20Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15418-15423Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) of these pathways. For RGS proteins, RGS9 in a complex with Gβ5 translocates to lipid rafts after activation of photoreceptor outer segments by illumination (22Nair K.S. Balasubramanian N. Slepak V.Z. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). RGS7 shows resistance to detergent extraction, but does not segregate with caveolin, a resident protein of lipid rafts, after gradient centrifugation (8Rose J.J. Taylor J.B. Shi J. Cockett M.I. Jones P.G. Hepler J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2103-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The lipid raft localization of other RGS proteins has not been reported. Besides being the home of acylated proteins, lipid rafts are also enriched in protein acyltransferase (PAT) activity (23Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43300-43304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Previously, we reported that amino-terminal cysteine residues on RGS16 were critical for its palmitoylation and ability to turn-off G-protein signaling in vivo, but not for its ability to act as a GTPase activating protein for Gα subunits in a solution-based assay (9Druey K.M.

Here, we investigated the action of palmitoylation for RGS16 function and found that mutation of the amino-terminal cysteine residues and the loss of palmitoylation changed the targeting of RGS16 from lipid rafts and prevented the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into a cysteine residue in the RGS box. In the accompanying article (24Osterhout J.L. Waheed A.A. Hiol A. Ward R.J. Davey P.C. Nini L. Wang J. Milligan G. Jones T.L.Z. Druey K.M. J. Biol.

Cysteine to alanine mutations for residues 2 and 12 in RGS16 were described previously (9Druey K.M. Ugur O. Caron J.M. Chen C.K. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cDNA for human RGS16 was inserted into the pcDNA3 vector with the DNA sequence for the hemagglutinin epitope in-frame at the 5′ end of the cDNA for RGS16. Mutation of Cys-98 in HA-RGS16 was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Construction of the pcDNA3 vector containing the cDNA for the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor subtype 1A fused in-frame to the pertussis toxin-resistant mutant of Gαo1 (Cys-351, the site of ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin, mutated to glycine) (5-HT1A/Gαo1) was described previously (25Kellett E. Carr I.C. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 684-692PubMed Google Scholar). A glutathione S-transferase-RGS16 fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli as previously described (9Druey K.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). RGS16 was cleaved from glutathione S-transferase using biotinylated thrombin and then separated from thrombin using streptavidin-agarose (Novagen). Purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaC1, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% (v/v) glycerol and stored at -80 °C.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Metabolic Labeling—Stable transfection of HEK293 cells with the plasmid containing the 5-HT1A/Gαo1 fusion protein was performed and the cells maintained as described (25Kellett E. Carr I.C. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 684-692PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 and HEK293 cells were transfected using 10 μg of DNA in 75-cm2 flasks using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and Superfect (Qiagen), respectively. 48 h after transfection, the cells were either harvested directly or prepared for radiolabeling by a 2-h incubation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for [3H]palmitate labeling or in the same media without methionine for [35S]methionine labeling. The cells were then incubated for 1 h in serum-free medium containing 500 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, specific activity 60 Ci/mmol), 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide or serum-free medium without methionine containing 250 μCi/ml Met-35S-Label (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). The cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min and stored at -80 °C.Cell Fractionation and Protein Determination—Cell pellets were homogenized and separated into particulate and soluble fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h as described (26Jones T.L.Z.

The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with immunoglobulin G as the standard.Immunotechniques and Fluorography—For immunoblotting, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Proteins were detected using the CT-265 antiserum raised against purified mouse RGS16 (9Druey K.M. Ugur O. Caron J.M. Chen C.K. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol.

Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of protein was incubated with 5 μl of the CT-265 antiserum or a polyclonal antibody to the HA epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and prepared as described (26Jones T.L.Z.

A. 1990; 87: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) except that after separation by SDS-PAGE, the tritium-labeled proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Fluorography was performed by coating the membranes with EA wax (EA Biotech Ltd.) and placing in film cassettes with MS film (Kodak) at -70 °C. The exposure times ranged from 3 to 7 days.Preparation of Membranes for GTPase Assay—30 h after transfection with plasmids encoding HA-RGS16 (WT or mutants), HEK-293 cells stably expressing the 5-HT1A/Gαo1 were treated overnight with pertussis toxin (50 ng/ml) to eliminate endogenous Gαi/o activity. 48 h after transfection, the cells were scraped and harvested in PBS and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and homogenized with 30-50 passages of a Dounce homogenizer followed by 15 passages through a 25-gauge needle. Unbroken cells and debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet the membrane fraction. Membranes were resuspended in TE buffer to ∼2 mg/ml and stored as aliquots at -80 °C.High Affinity GTPase Assay—Steady state GTPase activity was determined in HEK293 cell membranes expressing the 5-HT1A/Gαo1 fusion protein. Membrane preparations (10 μg of total protein) were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of 5-HT in an ATP-regenerating buffer system (20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 units/μl creatine kinase, 200 μM AMP-PNP, 500 μM ATP, 2 mm ouabain, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μM EDTA, pH 7.5, 80 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 μM GTP) spiked with 50,000 cpm of [γ-32P]GTP (Amersham Biosciences, 3000 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of ice-cold 10% (w/v) activated charcoal in 50 mm phosphoric acid followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing free [γ-32P]phosphate were analyzed using liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific GTPase activity was determined in simultaneous reactions containing 100 mm GTP.Plasma Membrane Isolation—Livers (6-9 g) from male rats, CD strain (Charles River Laboratories), were rapidly excised, washed in homogenization buffer (HB) consisting of 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm MgCl2, and cut into about 2-3-mm pieces. The rat liver pieces or COS cell pellets were homogenized in 5 volumes of HB by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and the liver samples were filtered through four layers of moistened gauze. The COS cell homogenate or the filtered homogenate from liver underwent centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was saved, and homogenization and centrifugation of the pellet was repeated in half the original volume of HB. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet (total membrane fraction) was suspended to bring the final buffer concentration to 1.42 M sucrose in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2 in a volume equal to twice the volume of the original homogenate, transferred to a nitrocellulose tube, and overlaid with HB. After centrifugation for 1 h at 120,000 × g in a Beckman SW28 rotor, the material at the interface of 0.25 and 1.42 M sucrose was suspended in HB in a volume equal to four times the initial pellet volume and washed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in buffer consisting of 1.35 M sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm MgCl2 and underwent centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 150 min. The pellet was washed in HB with centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The final pellet (plasma membrane fraction) was suspended in HB at 1.5 mg of protein/ml.Immunoelectron Microscopy—Subconfluent HEK293T cells were plated on Thermanox coverslips (Nunc, Inc.) and transfected with HA-pCDNA3 or HA-RGS16 plasmids in 12-well tissue culture plates. 24 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution before fixation with PLP fixative (28Brown W.J. Farquhar M.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 553-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) plus 0.25% electron microscopy grade glutaraldehyde for 2 h. All incubations were done at room temperature. After 2 rinses with PBS, cells were permeabilized with PBS, 0.01% saponin and incubated with or without primary antibody (anti-HA.11, Covance) diluted 1:500 in PBS, 0.01% saponin for 1 h. The secondary antibody, Nanogold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Nanoprobes, Inc.), was diluted 1:50 in PBS, 0.01% saponin and incubated with cells for an additional 1 h. After washing with PBS, the samples were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, washed three times for 5 min each with dH2O, and then the Nanogold was silver enhanced for 4 min with HQ Silver Reagents (Nanoprobes, Inc.). The samples were post-fixed for 30 min with 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.8% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, washed with dH2O, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections were cut with an RMC MT-7000 ultramicrotome (Boeckeler, Tucson, AZ) stained with 1% uranyl acetate and observed at 80 kV on a Philips CM-10 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). Images were acquired with an AMT digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques) and processed using Adobe Photoshop version 7 (Adobe Systems).Detergent-resistant Membrane (DRM) Partitioning and Cellular Cholesterol Depletion and Determination—Lipid raft isolation was carried out as previously described (29Waheed A.A. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32409-32412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Lindwasser O.W. Resh M.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7913-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets from transfected COS or HEK293 cells, or the plasma membrane fraction from rat livers were resuspended and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in cold buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 to give a detergent to protein ratio of 5:1. The samples were adjusted to 35% (v/v) OptiPrep and the DRM fraction separated by centrifugation on a 5/30/35% OptiPrep gradient. For depletion of cellular cholesterol, cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) for 30 min and then harvested. The concentration of cholesterol in the cell lysates was determined as described (21Miura Y. Hanada K. Jones T.L.Z. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15418-15423Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Protein Acyltransferase Activity—HEK293 cells stably expressing the 5-HT1A/Gαo1 fusion protein were treated with detergent and separated on an OptiPrep gradient as described above except six fractions of 0.78 ml were taken. Three μg of protein from each fraction was incubated for 45 min at 30 °C with 10 μg of purified RGS16, 200 μM coenzyme A, 2 mm ATP, and 1 μl of [9,10-3H]palmitate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, 30-60 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 100 μl as described (31Caron J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer and the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were either stained by Microwave-Blue (Protiga, Frederick, MD), or the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper and prepared for fluorography.Clostripain Treatment—After the final washing step, immunoprecipitates bound to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were resuspended in 30 μl of a buffer containing 75 mm NaPO4 and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol with and without 1.5 units of clostripain (Sigma) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer (Novex) and boiling. The peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10-20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen), and prepared for fluorography. MS films (Eastman Kodak) were exposed to the nitrocellulose membranes for 3 days at -70 °C.RESULTSGAP Activity of the C2/12A Mutant after Transfection—In a previous report (9Druey K.M. Ugur O. Caron J.M. Chen C.K. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we found that two amino-terminal cysteine residues (Cys-2 and Cys-12) on RGS16 were critical for palmitoylation and in vivo function, but were not necessary for membrane attachment and in vitro GAP activity. We tested whether the failure of the C2A/C12A mutant to turn-off Gi and Gq signaling was because of the inability of the mutant to accelerate the GTP hydrolysis of the Gα subunit in cellular membranes. To test GAP activity, we used a fusion protein in which the carboxyl terminus of the 5-HT1A receptor is fused to the amino terminus of a mutant form of Gαo1 (C351G) that is resistant to pertussis toxin treatment (25Kellett E. Carr I.C. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 684-692PubMed Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells stably expressing the fusion protein, GTPase activity of the fused Gα subunit in response to 5-HT is determined after inactivating endogenous Gαi and Gαo proteins by pertussis toxin. This method reduces GTP turnover of the endogenous Gαi and Gαo proteins, as well as ensuring a 1:1 stoichiometry of receptor to Gα subunit (32Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For these experiments, the stably transfected cells expressing the fusion protein were transiently transfected to co-express either the WT RGS16 or the C2A/C12A mutant with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the amino terminus. The level of expression of these proteins in the membrane was similar (Fig. 1A). As expected, 5-HT increased GTPase activity in membranes expressing the fusion protein alone (Fig. 1B, open diamonds). Membranes from cells co-expressing WT RGS16 showed a marked additional increase in GTPase activity in response to 5-HT (Fig. 1B, filled circles). The 5-HT-induced GTPase activity in membranes from cells expressing the C2A/C12A mutant was only slightly better than the membranes from the vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1B, filled squares). We tested whether the C2A/C12A mutation itself could affect RGS16 GAP activity by adding purified RGS16 proteins expressed in bacteria to the membranes of the 5-HT1A/Gαo1 fusion protein-expressing cells. Addition of WT RGS16 or RGS16 (C2A/C12A) to the membranes resulted in a nearly identical increase in 5-HT-evoked GTPase activity at each RGS16 concentration (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the poor function of the nonpalmitoylated C2A/C12A mutant of RGS16 within cells (Fig. 1B) (9Druey K.M. Ugur O. Caron J.M. Chen C.K. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was likely because of altered intracellular processing or targeting.Plasma Membrane Localization of the WT and Mutant RGS16—We investigated whether palmitoylation was critical for the plasma membrane localization of RGS16 because G protein signaling occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and other signaling proteins such as Gα13 (33Bhattacharyya R.

COS cells transfected with the WT RGS16 or the double cysteine mutant, C2A/C12A, were homogenized and subcellular fractions were obtained by gradient centrifugation. Both the WT RGS16 and the nonpalmitoylated C2A/C12A mutant were found to a similar degree in the fraction that was enriched in the plasma membrane protein, Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig. 2). In these experiments, we expressed RGS16 without any epitope tags and used the CT-265 antiserum raised against the whole protein. As in previous experiments (9Druey K.M. Ugur O. Caron J.M. Chen C.K. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we found two bands for RGS16 after separation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the CT-265 antiserum. These two bands are found in rat liver membranes (Fig. 4A) and after expression of the HA-tagged RGS16 when the CT-265 antiserum is used for detection. The lower band could represent a degradation product missing part of the amino terminus because it is not detected with the HA antibody (Fig. 1A).Fig. 2Plasma membrane localization of the WT and C2A/C12A mutant of RGS16.

https://openalex.org/W2084499174,"Cyclin G is a transcriptional target gene of tumor suppressor p53. Recent studies present evidence that cyclin G may play a central role in the p53-Mdm2 autoregulated module, but the precise function of cyclin G remains elusive. Here, we show a negative effect of cyclin G on the stability of p53 and p73. Cyclin G expression resulted in a dramatic decrease of p53 protein levels in response to DNA damage and abrogated irradiation-mediated G1 arrest along with an increase of S phase in MCF7 cells containing wild-type p53. In p53-null Saos2 cells, cyclin G inhibited p73 induction in response to genotoxic stress and delayed the camptothecin-mediated cell cycle arrest. Cyclin G interacts with p53 as well as p73, and its binding to p53 or p73 presumably mediates downregulation of p53 and p73. We also found that cyclin G-mediated reduction of p53 but not of p73 is Mdm2-dependent. Moreover, inhibition of cyclin G by small interfering RNA (siRNA) caused the accumulation of p53 and p73 protein levels in response to DNA damage. Therefore, our results imply that cyclin G is transcriptionally activated by p53 or p73, and, in turn, cyclin G negatively regulates the stabilization of p53 family proteins through an unknown mechanism different from ubiquitination or transcriptional control."

The latter is part of a signaling pathway that controls the lysosomal-autophagic catabolism in human colon cancer HT-29 cells. In the present work we show that the mRNA encoding for AGS3 is expressed in human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and HT-29) whatever their state of differentiation. Together with the full-length form, minute amounts of the mRNA encoding a NH2-terminal truncated form of AGS3, previously characterized in cardiac tissues, were also detected. Both the endogenous form of AGS3 and a tagged expressed form have a localization compatible with a role in the Gαi3–dependent control of autophagy. Accordingly, expressing its non-Gαi3-interacting NH2-terminal domain or its Gαi3-interacting COOH-terminal domain reversed the stimulatory role of AGS3 on autophagy. On the basis of biochemical and morphometric analysis, we conclude that AGS3 is involved in an early event during the autophagic pathway probably prior to the formation of the autophagosome.

In fact AGS3 is a guanine dissociation inhibitor that inhibits the dissociation of GDP bound to the α subunit and at the same time inhibits the association of the GDP-bound form of Gαi proteins with βγ dimers. AGS3 is a bimodular protein, its amino-terminal half contains seven TPR repeats and its carboxyl-terminal half contains four GoLoco motifs that interact with Gαi proteins. Recently, a NH2-terminal truncated AGS3 containing only GoLoco motifs has been shown to be the major AGS3 form present in heart while the full-length form (7 TPR + 4 GoLoco) is more widely distributed (34Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Few data are available concerning the involvement of AGS3 in a cell biological context.In the present work we show that the mRNA encoding for the full-length form of AGS3 is expressed in different human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2, HT-29) whatever their state of differentiation. Together with the full-length form, a low expression of the mRNA encoding the NH2-terminal truncated form of AGS3 was detected. The distribution of the tagged form of AGS3 and that of the endogenous suggests that AGS3 could be part of the Gαi3-dependent control of autophagy in intestinal cells. Both biochemical and morphometric analysis show that AGS3 is involved in the control of an early step of macroautophagy prior to the formation of the autophagosome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents3-MA, monodansylcadaverine, anti-FLAG-M2, anti-p58, anti-HA antibodies and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.

The reverse primer used was (P3): 5′-TGCACCCTCTGAATGAGGCTG-3′.Northern Blot—Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from HT-29 and Caco-2 cells using the direct Oligotex mini kit according the supplier's instructions. The P2–P3 probe obtained by RT-PCR was 32P-labeled by random priming. Hybridizations were conducted at 42 °C and high-stringency washes were performed in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C.Cell FractionationSeventy-two hours after transfection, cells were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in hypotonic buffer (1 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After scraping, cells were centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at 500 × g. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to generate a cytosolic fraction and a membrane fraction.Subcellular FractionationSubcellular fractionation was performed as previously described (35Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Bauvy C. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Codogno P. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 289-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and aprotinin (100 units/ml). All the following steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were homogenized in a Potter homogenizer until greater than 90% of the cells had been broken, and a postnuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation for 10 min at 500 × g. Five-hundred microliters were layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.4, and 1.8 m: 750 μl each) and centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000 × g (Beckman 70 Ti rotor). Sixteen fractions (400 μl) were collected from the top and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The resulting pellets were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE.ImmunoblottingHT-29 cells were scraped in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. One-hundred μg of proteins were submitted to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 2% BSA. Anti-FLAG (1:4000) and anti-HA, (1:2000) were used to detect AGS3-FL and AGS3-4GoLoco, respectively. After 3 washes in Tris-buffered saline, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).ImmunofluorescenceStaining of AGS3 Domains—HT-29 cells transfected with either cDNA encoding for AGS3-7TPR or AGS3-4GoLoco were grown on glass slides. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS for 30 min. Next, they were incubated for 10 min in 50 mm NH4Cl diluted in PBS. Cells were then permeabilized for 30 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed with PBS, 2% BSA. Samples were first incubated with a mouse anti-HA (1:100) or a mouse anti-FLAG (1:200) for 60 min at room temperature. After rinses with PBS, 2% BSA, samples were incubated with a CY3-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody for 60 min at room temperature. As controls, the primary antibody was omitted. Coverslips were mounted with glycergel and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan, Zeiss).Staining of AGS3-FL, Endoplasmic Reticulum, and Golgi Apparatus—HT-29 cells or HT-29 cells transfected with cDNA encoding for AGS3-FL were grown on glass slides. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS for 30 min. Next, they were incubated for 10 min in 50 mm NH4Cl diluted in PBS. Thereafter, cells were then permeabilized for 30 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed with PBS, 2% BSA. AGS3-FL-expressing cells were first incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:100) and a rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (1:200) for 60 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, 2% BSA, cells were incubated with a CY3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200) and a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200) for 60 min at room temperature. HT-29 cells were first incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antibody (1:100) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-AGS3 antibody (1:200) for 60 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, 2% BSA, cells were incubated with a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200) and a CY3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200) for 60 min at room temperature. For co-staining with anti-giantin, HT-29 cells and AGS3-FL-expressing cells were first incubated with a rabbit anti-AGS3 antibody (1:200), directed against the last 14 amino acids at the COOH terminus of rat AGS3 (31De Vries L. Fischer T. Tronchere H. Brothers G.M. Strockbine B. Siderovski D.P. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14364-14369Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and a mouse anti-giantin antibody (1:1000) for 60 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, 2% BSA, cells were incubated with a CY3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:200) and a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:200) for 60 min at room temperature. For co-staining with the Gαi3 protein, HT-29 cells were first incubated with a rabbit anti-Gαi3 polyclonal antibody (1:50) for 60 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, 2% BSA, samples were incubated with a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for 60 min at room temperature. Samples were then incubated with a goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 IgG fragment to saturate the first anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibody. After rinsing with PBS, 2% BSA, samples were incubated with a rabbit anti-AGS3 for 60 min at room temperature. In AGS3-FL-expressing cells, co-staining experiments were performed with a rabbit anti-Gαi3 polyclonal antibody and a mouse anti-HA with the respective secondary antibody. In all the above described conditions, coverslips were mounted with glycergel and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy equipped with epifluorescent optics (Leica TCS SP).Monodansylcadaverine Staining—When necessary, AGS3-FL-expressing cells were used 72 h after transfection. Both HT-29 cells and AGS3-FL-expressing cells were first washed with HBSS and then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in HBSS. For staining of autophagic vacuoles a monodansylcadaverine stock solution (0.1 m in Me2SO) was diluted 1:1000 in HBSS and applied to the cells for 60 min at 37 °C (36Biederbick A. Kern H.F. Elsasser H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). After washes with PBS, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 10 min with 50 mm NH4Cl and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Rabbit anti-AGS3 antibody (HT-29 cells) or mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (AGS3-FL-expressing cells) were incubated for 60 min at room temperature to detect AGS3 and AGS3-FL, respectively. The appropriate secondary CY3-conjugated antibody was then incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with glycergel and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan, Zeiss).Macroautophagic ParametersMeasurement of the degradation of [14C]valine-labeled long-lived proteins and LDH sequestration were monitored as reported previously (26Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. De Stefanis D. Bauvy C. Baccino F.M. Isidoro C. Codogno P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Analysis of Protein Degradation—HT-29 cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with 0.2 μCi/ml l-[14C]valine. Unincorporated radioisotope was removed by three rinses with PBS (pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in nutrient-free medium (without amino acids and in the absence of fetal calf serum) plus 0.1% BSA and 10 mm cold valine. When required 10 mm 3-MA, a potent inhibitor of the formation of autophagic vacuoles (38Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), was added throughout the chase period. After the first hour of incubation, at which time short-lived proteins were being degraded, the medium was replaced with the appropriate fresh medium and the incubation continued for an additional 4-h period. Cells and radiolabeled proteins from the 4-h chase medium were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid (v/v) at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were separated from the soluble radioactivity by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min then dissolved in 250 μl of Soluene 350. The rate of protein degradation was calculated as acid-soluble radioactivity recovered from both cells and media.Analysis of LDH Sequestration—Briefly, cells were gently washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) and then twice with homogenization buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 300 mm sucrose, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5). Cells were homogenized in 1 ml of cold homogenization buffer by 13 strokes in a glass/Teflon homogenizer on ice. A postnuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Postnuclear material was layered on 4 ml of buffered metrizamide/sucrose (10% sucrose, 8% metrizamide, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 7000 × g for 60 min. Finally, the pellet was washed once with homogenization buffer and resuspended in buffer containing 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm mannitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin. The suspension was sonicated (VibraCell™ sonicator model 72434, power setting 3, microtip, for 20 s at 20% charge) and centrifuged (10 min, 10,000 × g). The LDH activity was assayed by measuring the oxidation of NADH with pyruvate as substrate at 340 nm.Electron Microscopy and Morphometry—Morphometric analysis was performed as previously described (35Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Bauvy C. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Codogno P. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 289-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cells grown on Petri dishes were cultured for 3 h in a nutrient-free medium to stimulate autophagy in the presence of 50 μm vinblastine before being fixed for 2 h with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, embedded in Epon, and processed for transmission electron microscopy by standard procedures. For morphometric analysis 20 micrographs per condition were used. The fractional volume represented by autophagic vacuoles was quantified by using the method of Weibel et al. (39Weibel E.R. Stäubli W. Gnägi H.R. Hess F.A. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 68-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar) assuming a spherical shape for the calculation. Morphological criteria were used to identify autophagic vacuoles (40Lawrence P.B. Brown W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 515-526PubMed Google Scholar).Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis of differences between the groups was performed using Student's t test. p < 0.005 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSAGS3 Expression in Intestinal Cells—The use of primers P1 and P3 (Fig. 1A) in RT-PCR experiments allowed us to detect a product with the expected size for the human full-length AGS3 in undifferentiated HT-29 cells (Fig. 1B, left panel). The product was also detected in HT-29 MTX and HT-29 FUra cells with goblet cell-like (41Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6334-6343PubMed Google Scholar) and enterocyte-like (42Lesuffleur T. Kornowski A. Luccioni C. Muleris M. Barbat A. Beaumatin J. Dussaulx E. Dutrillaux B. Zweibaum A. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) phenotypes, respectively. The expression of the full-length AGS3 was not restricted to HT-29 cells. In Caco-2 cells, which spontaneously differentiate in enterocyte-like cells in a growth dependent manner (43Pinto M. Robine-Léon S. Appay M.D. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Simon-Assmann P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 323-330Google Scholar), the RT-PCR product was detected before (day 4) and after differentiation (day 21) (Fig. 1B, left panel). When oligonucleotides P2 and P3 were used, the same RT-PCR product of 496 bp was detected in all cell populations tested (Fig. 1B, right panel).As a short form of AGS3 truncated of its NH2-terminal part and encompassing the sequence amplified between P2 and P3 has been detected in rat heart (34Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we checked by Northern blot analysis whether the fragment of 496 bp corresponds to the short form of AGS3. The P2–P3 RT-PCR product was used as probe in the Northern blot experiment (Fig. 1C). Both the ∼4-kb mRNA encoding the full-length AGS3 and the 2-kb mRNA encoding the 5′ truncated form were detected in poly(A)+ RNA isolated from undifferentiated HT-29 cells (thereafter referred to HT-29 cells) and from undifferentiated and differentiated Caco-2 cells. Whatever the cell population considered, mRNA encoding the full-length AGS3 is more expressed than the mRNA encoding the short form AGS3 (Fig. 1C). The amount of poly(A)+ RNA available was not sufficient to investigate the short form AGS3 expression in HT-29 MTX cells and HT-29 FUra cells.AGS3 and the Gαi3Protein Have a Partially Overlapping Membrane Distribution—We have previously shown that the Gαi3 protein is associated with Golgi and ER membranes in HT-29 cells (35Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Bauvy C. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Codogno P. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 289-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular localization of the endogenous AGS3 protein has been investigated by immunofluorescence. A heterogeneous cytoplasmic staining pattern of AGS3 was observed by immunofluorescence examination (Fig. 2A). However, double staining experiments revealed a limited overlapping staining with the ER marker protein-disulfide isomerase and with the Golgi marker giantin (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Localization of AGS3 proteins in HT-29 cells.A, immunofluorescence.

Upon hormone withdrawal these cells stop proliferating and undergo apoptotic process. In this report we demonstrate that a controlled increase in [Ca2+]i induces hormone-independent survival and proliferation of TF-1 cells. We found that moderate elevation of [Ca2+]i by the addition of cyclopiasonic-acid protected TF1 cells from apoptosis. Furthermore, a higher, but transient elevation of [Ca2+]i by ionomycin treatment induced cell proliferation. In both cases caspase-3 activity was reduced, and Bcl-2 was up-regulated. Higher elevation of [Ca2+]i by ionomycin induced MEK-dependent biphasic ERK1/2 activation, sufficient to move the cells from G0/G1 to S/M phases. Meanwhile, activation of ERK1/2, phosphorylation of the Elk-1 transcription factor, and, consequently, a substantial elevation of Egr-1 and c-Fos levels and AP-1 DNA binding were observed. Moderate elevation of [Ca2+]i, on the other hand, caused a delayed monophasic activation of ERK1/2 and Elk-1 that was accompanied with only a small increase of Egr-1 and c-Fos levels and AP-1 DNA binding. The specific MEK-1 kinase inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited all the effects of increasing [Ca2+]i, indicating that the MAPK/ERK pathway activation is essential for TF-1 cell survival and proliferation. Based on these results we suggest that the elevation of the [Ca2+]i may influence the cytokine dependence of hemopoietic progenitors and may contribute to pathological hematopoiesis.

The tight control of proliferation, survival, and apoptosis of bone marrow progenitor cells has a major role in allowing normal hematopoiesis.

Lee F. Miyajima A. Miyatake S. Arai N. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 783-836Google Scholar). Hemopoietic cells undergo apoptotic cell death in the absence of growth factors, whereas an escape from this regulation may result in leukemogenesis. The human GM-CSF/IL-3-dependent myelo-erythroid cell line, TF-1, has been reported to undergo apoptosis upon hormone deprivation (2Kolonics A. Apati A. Janossy J. Brozik A. Gati R. Schaefer A. Magocsi M. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 743-754Google Scholar). Apoptosis of these cells can be suppressed by re-administration of GM-CSF, IL-3, or IL-4 (3Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Google Scholar) or overexpression of Bcl-2 (4Alvarado-Moreno J.A. Nieves-Ramirez M.E. Caceres-Cortes J.R. Rev. Invest. Clin. 2000; 52: 645-653Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]i)-increasing agents can also suppress the apoptotic process and result in long term cell survival. A number of endogenous substances (adrenergic, purinergic agonists, and cytokines) are able to evoke different [Ca2+]isignals. To examine the effect of calcium signals on cell survival and proliferation, we have applied various [Ca2+]i-mobilizing agents. SERCA inhibitors, e.g. cyclopiasonic acid (CPA) and thapsigargin deplete sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, which in turn induce capacitative influx of Ca2+ (5Seidler N.W. Jona I. Vegh M. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17816-17823Google Scholar). Ca2+ ionophores like A23187 and ionomycin mobilize Ca2+ from nonspecific sources (6Mintz E. Guillain F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 52-70Google Scholar). In parallel with the distinct mechanism of Ca2+ elevation, the level of [Ca2+]i and its physiological effects may also differ among these [Ca2+]i-increasing reagents. We demonstrate that endogenous substances induce similar [Ca2+]i increases as CPA. Thus the elevation of [Ca2+]i caused by CPA is within the range of physiological [Ca2+]i signals. The alteration of intracellular Ca2+ concentration control cellular processes as diverse as proliferation, development, contraction, or secretion. However, when exceeding its normal spatial and temporal boundaries, Ca2+ can result in cell death through both necrosis and apoptosis (7Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to delineate how Ca2+ can have multiple roles in cell survival and growth. Ca2+functions directly through regulation of gene expression,e.g. c-fos (8Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Google Scholar) or via activating Ca2+-dependent enzymatic action,e.g. calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases II and IV in neurons, calcineurin in lymphocytes, and in conjunction with other signaling pathways such as those regulated through MAPK and PI3K (for review see Ref. 7Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar). Another possible mechanism to consider is the activation of signaling pathways similar to those activated by GM-CSF. GM-CSF induces several pathways, e.g. STAT-5, MAPK, PI3K, protein kinase C, and phospholipase C γ. Because the major route activated by GM-CSF is the MAPK pathway, our primary goal was to determine whether all biological events are the result of this activation or whether additional pathways are responsible. In T lymphocytes and PC12 cells, elevated Ca2+ was reported to stimulate MAPK activity (9Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Google Scholar, 10Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 75-85Google Scholar). Stimulation of the MAPK cascade causes the phosphorylation and activation of additional downstream targets, such as p90Rsk, CREB, and Elk-1 (11Okuda K. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Kanakura Y. Hallek M. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2880-2887Google Scholar, 12Bashey A. Healy L. Marshall C.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 949-957Google Scholar, 13McCubrey J.A. May W.S. Duronio V. Mufson A. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 9-21Google Scholar). Activated CREB and Elk-1 can induce the transcription of immediate early genes such asegr-1 and c-fos (14Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Google Scholar, 15Sheng M. Dougan S.T. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2787-2796Google Scholar) followed by other genes that control apoptotic processes (16Yuan P.X. Huang L.D. Jiang Y.M. Gutkind J.S. Manji H.K. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31674-31683Google Scholar, 17Boucher M.J. Morisset J. Vachon P.H. Reed J.C. Laine J. Rivard N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 355-369Google Scholar) or promote cytokine production (18Adachi T. Choudhury B.K. Stafford S. Sur S. Alam R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2198-2204Google Scholar), all modulating proliferation and survival. In this report we show that agents (CPA and ionomycin) that generate distinct elevation of [Ca2+]i from different sources result in the activation of the MEK/ERK/Elk-1 pathway. Ionomycin induces similar cellular responses as GM-CSF, the natural growth factor of TF-1 cells. In both cases activation of the MEK/ERK/Elk-1 displayed similar kinetics and resulted in cell survival and proliferation. In contrast, CPA induces a delayed MEK/ERK/Elk-1 activation, sufficient only to trigger cell survival. These results point to the importance of the kinetics of the Ca2+signal. Taken together we report that the increase of [Ca2+]i by activating the MAPK/ERK results in an escape of CD34-positive myelo-erythroid leukemia cells from apoptosis induced by hormone-deprivation. These results suggest that an elevation of [Ca2+]i may rescue hemopoietic progenitor cells from apoptosis induced by hormone deprivation in the bone marrow. These effects may protect normal progenitor cells but may also lead to the development of pathological hematopoiesis. Unless otherwise specified, all chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. The tissue culture media were purchased from Invitrogen, whereas GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-4, PD98059 (MEK1 inhibitor), and UO126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) were purchased from New England BioLabs. The factor-dependent human myelo-erythroid leukemia cell line, TF-1 (3Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. C. Braun, Heinrich Pette Institute for experimental Virology and Immunology (Hamburg, Germany). Cells were grown in RPMI medium without nucleosides, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2.5 ng/ml GM-CSF. In all experiments prior to stimulation cells were maintained overnight in GM-CSF-free medium. The addition of the inducers was considered as the t = 0 h of the experiments. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide incorporation (19Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar) or FACS analysis (propidium iodide) assay (20Weisinger G. Zinder O. Simantov R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 530-537Google Scholar). Cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide staining was performed according to a previous study (21Darzynkiewicz Z. Juan G. Li X. Gorczyca W. Murakami T. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1997; 27: 1-20Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed overnight in 70% ethanol, washed, and incubated with 100 μg/ml RNase (Sigma) and 10 μg/ml propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were analyzed for DNA content by a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Data were analyzed by ModFit software. Cells were lysed as described previously (2Kolonics A. Apati A. Janossy J. Brozik A. Gati R. Schaefer A. Magocsi M. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 743-754Google Scholar). 50 μg of lysed cell protein was separated by SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membrane using the Mini-Protean II system (Bio-Rad). The primary antibodies anti-(Egr-1), anti-(c-Fos), anti-(ERK1), anti-(PARP), anti-(Bcl-xl), anti-(Bax) rabbit polyclonal IgG and anti-(phospho-ERK), anti-(phospho-Elk-1), and anti-(Bcl-2) mouse monoclonal IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate and anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch as secondary antibodies. Membranes stained at first, with monoclonal antibodies anti-(phospho-ERK), and anti-(phospho-Elk-1), were incubated in TBS/0.1% Tween 20 containing 0.5% H2O2 at room temperature for 30 min, than washed three times with TBS/0.1% Tween 20, and developed by the polyclonal anti-ERK1 antibody. The ECL system was used for chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). For quantitative analysis of Western blots, image analyses of x-ray films were performed using Bioscan version 1.0 software following digitalization with a Hewlett Packard 5100C scanner. DNA-binding proteins were extracted, and the band-shift assay was performed by applying 5 μg of protein and a radiolabeled consensus oligonucleotide probe as reported previously (22Schaefer A. Magocsi M. Fandrich A. Marquardt H. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 505-511Google Scholar). Santa Cruz Biotechnology produced the oligonucleotide probe (AP-1). In experiments addressing the onset of apoptosis during GM-CSF withdrawal and after the re-administration of GM-CSF, ionomycin, or CPA, TF-1 cells were seeded (5 × 105 cells/ml) into RPMI 1640/10% FCS for 16 h, than supplemented with 2.5 ng/ml GM-CSF, 1 μm ionomycin, or 7.5 μm CPA. After various incubation times, total cellular DNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells, based on the method described previously (23Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922Google Scholar), and loaded into the dry wells of 1.8% agarose gel containing 0.1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Cells were treated with the test substances as described in the figure legends. At various time points 3 × 106 cells were harvested and cell extracts were prepared by the freeze-thawing method in the following lysis puffer: 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μmNa3V04, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml antipain. The protein content of the samples was determined using the Bradford dye-assay (reagent obtained from Sigma), and aliquots containing 50 μg of protein were used in a fluorometric caspase-3 enzyme activity assay, carried out in a microplate reader (24Petak I. Mihalik R. Bauer P.I. Suli-Vargha H. Sebestyen A. Kopper L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 614-618Google Scholar). In a final volume of 100 μl, containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.025% CHAPS, and 50 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC (acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) as substrate, the liberation of AMC was followed in time (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 mm). The fluorescence intensities were converted into AMC concentrations using an AMC calibration curve. Activities were standardized to the caspase-3 activity obtained in GM-CSF-deprived cells (3.3 ± 0.5 μm ACM calculated from three independent experiments). Cells (0.5–1 × 106 cells/ml) were loaded for 30 min at 37 °C with 1.5 μm fura-2AM in fresh culture medium containing 1% FCS. Than extracellular fura-2AM was removed by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in fresh culture medium containing 10% FCS. Cells were treated for various incubation times with the test substances, 2.5 ng/ml GM-CSF, 1 μmionomycin, or 7.5 μm CPA. In certain experiments 7.5 μm CPA, 1 mm ATP, 1 unit/ml thrombin, 250 ng/ml trypsin, 5 units/ml erythropoietin, 5 ng/ml IL-4, 5 ng/ml IL-3, and 10 ng/ml nerve growth factor were added to untreated cells. Fluorescence was measured in a Hitachi F4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 37 °C under gentle agitation, as described previously (25Schaefer A. Magocsi M. Stocker U. Fandrich A. Marquardt H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13484-13490Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic free calcium concentration was calculated by using the method of Tsien et al. (26Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 325-334Google Scholar). The presence of extracellular fura-2AM fluorescence was checked by the addition of EGTA (0.5 mm), followed by CaCl2 (1 mm), to the control cells. The leakage of fura-2AM proved to be small during the experimental period. Nevertheless, this leakage was taken into consideration in the calibration procedure. TF-1 cells were synchronized by GM-CSF hormone deprivation and thereafter treated with CPA (7.5 μm), ionomycin (1 μm), or GM-CSF (2.5 ng/ml). These concentrations were chosen after optimization, considering the viability of treated cells. The effects of the above reagents on the cell growth were determined (Fig. 1 A). The GM-CSF deprived (control) cells did not multiply, and within 72 h their cell number gradually decreased to about 26% of the original. When GM-CSF was re-administered after a leg period of about 24 h, the hormone-deprived cells started to grow exponentially. Interestingly, the addition of ionomycin also induced a gradual increase in the cell number, producing a cell growth of about 250% in the first 48 h. Addition of CPA did not increase significantly the cell number, but prevented its decline, relative to the control cells. As documented in Fig. 1 B, the viability of the control (hormone-deprived) cells decreased to about 45% within 72 h. In contrast, the viability of the GM-CSF-, ionomycin-, or CPA-treated cells did not change notably within this time frame. Measuring the viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide incorporation or propidium iodide gave similar results (data not shown). To test how the traverse of the cell cycle was affected, the DNA content of cells subjected to various treatments was analyzed. Samples of GM-CSF-, ionomycin-, and CPA-treated cells were collected every 3 h during an interval of 33 h. The ratio of cells in the three cell cycle phases, G1/G0, S, and G2/M was determined by flow cytometry analysis by using propidium iodide staining (Fig. 2). These experiments indicated that re-administration of GM-CSF forced the majority of cells to enter S phase within 18 h (Fig.2 A) while ionomycin induced a moderate access of cells to S phase (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, CPA treatment caused cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2 C). These results, along with the proliferation measurements, reveal that ionomycin, similarly to GM-CSF, induces cell growth. Both CPA and ionomycin induce store depletion followed by an activated Ca2+ influx. Therefore, we tested whether store depletion and/or an increased level of [Ca2+]i were responsible for CPA-induced cell survival. To buffer changes in [Ca2+]i, cells were loaded with a relatively high concentration of BAPTA-AM (160 μm). High concentration of the chelator was needed due to the inability of lower concentrations to abolish CPA-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in the presence of external Ca2+ (not shown). In another approach, extracellular Ca2+ was chelated with 3 mm EGTA. Both treatments caused cell death. BAPTA-AM caused a drastic drop of cell viability, with cells dying within 12 h irrespective of the particular treatment. EGTA decreased the cell number by 75.1 ± 2.1%, 43.9 ± 5.2%, 87.2 ± 3.2%, and 94.6 ± 2.8% of control, GM-CSF-, CPA-, and ionomycin-treated cells, respectively, within 24 h. CPA and ionomycin presumably caused more excessive store depletion, which may account for the more rapid cell death compared with control or GM-CSF-treated cells. Thus, sustained store depletion induces cell death rather than survival, and Ca2+influx appears to be crucial in CPA- and ionomycin-dependent survival of TF-1 cells. Because non-excitable cells generally do not endure high elevations of [Ca2+]i, the signs of apoptosis were also examined. As shown in Fig. 3 A, long term hormone deprivation induced a delayed increase of caspase-3 activity and the appearance of PARP cleavage product (Fig.3 B). A marked DNA ladder formation (Fig. 3 C) also appeared within 24 h. In contrast, GM-CSF, CPA, and ionomycin treatment suppressed caspase-3 activity to the level observed in the normally cultured cells (41.5 ± 3.65%) within 6 h. Furthermore, no cleavage of PARP or DNA ladder formation was detected even after 48 h (Fig. 3). These results, reinforced by the viability measurement, show that the treatments described above protected the cells from apoptosis. As a summary, hormone-deprived cells stopped growing and lost their viability within 72 h. GM-CSF, the natural growth hormone for TF-1 cells, suppressed apoptotic processes and induced cell proliferation. Controlled increase of [Ca2+]i caused by ionomycin and CPA protected against cell death, and ionomycin even produced a significant cell growth. These findings suggest that both [Ca2+]i increase and GM-CSF can induce survival and proliferation. The receptor (cytokine, purinergic, and proteinase-activated receptor)-mediated Ca signals were compared with the [Ca2+]i increase induced by Ca2+-mobilizing agents. The [Ca2+]i of overnight hormone-deprived TF-1 cells (control) were estimated by pre-loading the cells with fura-2AM and measuring the intracellular calcium dependent fluorescence. Fig. 4(A–D) shows the alterations of [Ca2+]i in control cells following the addition of the purinergic receptor ligand (1 mm ATP), proteinase-activated receptor ligands (1 unit/ml thrombin, 250 ng/ml trypsin), or 7.5 μm CPA. The [Ca2+]i of control cells increased from 102.0 ± 11.7 to 180.8 ± 32.5, 562.2 ± 89.1, 256.3 ± 32.1, and 236.0 ± 45.4 nm following the addition of 1 mm ATP, 1 unit/ml thrombin, 250 ng/ml trypsin, and 7.5 μm CPA, respectively. This initial elevation of [Ca2+]i diminished within a few minutes in the case of ATP and thrombin treatment, whereas trypsin- and CPA-induced sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i(167.1 ± 28.4 and 212.2 ± 34.8 nm, respectively). Certain agents, like IL-3, IL-4, erythropoietin, and nerve growth factor, which induce Ca2+ fluxes in other cells, had no effect on intracellular Ca2+ levels in TF-1 cells (data not shown). Thus, based on these experiments, both endogenous and pharmacological agents may modify [Ca2+]i in TF-1 cells. In the following experiments, we applied CPA and ionomycin to induce controlled increases in [Ca2+]i in TF-1 cells. Alterations of [Ca2+]i were measured for 2 h after the addition of the above reagents to estimate the long term effect of CPA and ionomycin. We found that CPA induced a moderate, transient increase in [Ca2+]i, with a maximum of 228.2 ± 40.6 nm, whereas ionomycin produced a higher [Ca2+]i reaching 1397.5 ± 160.2 nm. In both cases [Ca2+]i approached the control level within 1 h. No detectable changes of [Ca2+]i within the time period examined were observed in the control cells or in cells treated with GM-CSF (TableI).Table IMeasurement of [Ca2+]i by fura-2AM measurementsTime[Ca2+]iControlGM-CSFCPAIonomycinminnm0.593.1 ± 30.494.9 ± 19.5228.2 ± 40.61398 ± 1603097.8 ± 25.198.8 ± 26.1142.3 ± 29.2570 ± 1456092.1 ± 33.389.2 ± 24.4122.2 ± 39.9153.4 ± 36.312094.4 ± 27.294.7 ± 23.299.4 ± 28.8146.4 ± 40.5TF-1 cells were synchronized by overnight GM-CSF hormone deprivation and thereafter treated with 7.5 μm CPA, I μm ionomycin, 2.5 ng/ml GM-CSF. Alterations of [Ca2+]i were estimated by preloading the cells with fura-2AM and measuring the intracellular calcium-dependent fluorescence at the times indicated after the addition of the above reagents (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data represent at least three independent measurements (mean ± S.D.). Open table in a new tab TF-1 cells were synchronized by overnight GM-CSF hormone deprivation and thereafter treated with 7.5 μm CPA, I μm ionomycin, 2.5 ng/ml GM-CSF. Alterations of [Ca2+]i were estimated by preloading the cells with fura-2AM and measuring the intracellular calcium-dependent fluorescence at the times indicated after the addition of the above reagents (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data represent at least three independent measurements (mean ± S.D.). All in all, CPA- and ionomycin-induced [Ca2+]ialterations were comparable with the effect of endogenous substances. CPA and ionomycin induced controlled [Ca2+]ielevation, which was down-regulated within 1 h. GM-CSF, on the other hand, did not increase [Ca2+]i in these cells. To identify some of the possible mechanisms allowing hormone-deprived cells to avoid apoptosis, changes in the well-known apoptotic protein family, Bcl-2 were examined. Synchronization by overnight hormone withdrawal was taken as the starting point of all investigations (t = 0 h). Whole cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) and pro-apoptotic (Bax) proteins. The level of Bcl-xl doubled in 24 h after re-administration of GM-CSF, increasing to 2.5-fold by 48 h. Unlike GM-CSF, ionomycin treatment induced only a minor increase in Bcl-xl expression (1.5-fold) by 24 h, without further augmentation. Bcl-xl expression remained unaltered in CPA-treated cells (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, GM-CSF, ionomycin, and CPA invariably triggered a comparable expression of Bcl-2, each doubling its level. However, the rate of expression induced by CPA was slower, reaching the level detected in GM-CSF-treated cells with a 24-h delay (Fig. 5 B). None of these treatments yielded any change in the level of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax (Fig. 5 C). The finding that the anti-apoptotic proteins dominated the apoptotic proteins correlated with the viability measurements (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the regulation of the Bcl-2 family plays a major role in the survival of TF-1 cells. Meanwhile, among the gradually dying control cells (Fig.1 B), a moderate decrease in the level of Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 (Fig. 5, A and B) was seen, accompanied by a small increase of Bax (Fig. 5 C). To summarize, controlled elevation of [Ca2+]iinduced the up-regulation of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein without the alteration of other proteins of the Bcl-2 family. This Bcl-2 up-regulation enabled TF-1 cells to evade apoptosis. The activation of the MAPK pathway is one of the major routes leading to cell survival and/or proliferation. Specific monoclonal anti-pERK antibodies enabled us to follow the kinetics and level of ERK1/2 kinase phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.6 A, in a good correlation with the [Ca2+]i signal, a rapid activation of ERK1/2 was observed 5 min following treatment with the [Ca2+]i-increasing agents. Thus, CPA resulted in a minor stimulation, whereas ionomycin concentration above 500 nm induced marked phosphorylation. Below this ionomycin concentration no activation of ERK1/2 was detected. Elk-1 activation showed a correlation with ERK1/2 stimulation. As revealed, a threshold of ERK1/2 phosphorylation has to be reached for Elk-1 activation. This finding explains the activation of Elk-1 only above 500 nmionomycin and the failure of activation by CPA. In terms of the physiological outcome, the kinetics of signaling is probably as critical as the extent of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. To better characterize the activation processes, the time course of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was studied. Two phases of phosphorylation were observed in the case of GM-CSF, ionomycin, and CPA. The first appeared 5 min after the exposure to these agents, and the second followed between 2 and 3 h (Fig.6 B). At 5 min, CPA elicited only a moderate activation, while ionomycin and GM-CSF caused 13- and 28-fold elevations, respectively. In all cases, phosphorylation returned to control levels within 1 h. Intriguingly, a second 11-fold elevation appeared at 2 h in the case of ionomycin, whereas GM-CSF and CPA induced only a 7-fold increase later, at 3 h. Elk-1 phosphorylation followed ERK1/2 phosphorylation when ERK1/2 activation reached the critical level, described above (Fig. 6 C). As expected, Elk-1 phosphorylation did no"
https://openalex.org/W2032351190,"Smac (or DIABLO) is a recently identified, novel proapoptotic molecule, which is released from mitochondria into the cytosol during apoptosis. Smac functions by eliminating the caspase-inhibitory properties of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP), particularly XIAP. In this study, we stably transfected both full-length (FL) and mature (MT) Smac genes into the K562 and CEM leukaemic cell lines. Both FL and MT Smac transfectants increased the sensitivity of leukaemic cells to UV light-induced apoptosis and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Purified cytosol from the mature Smac transfectants, or the addition of human recombinant Smac protein or N-7 peptide into nontransfected cytosol, showed an increased sensitivity to cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-3. The mature Smac enhanced the susceptibility of both K562 and CEM cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of the mature Smac protein also inhibited proliferation, as detected by reduced colony formation and Ki-67 expression in leukaemic cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that Smac transfectants displayed significant G0/G1 arrest and reduction in 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Smac sensitized human acute myeloid leukaemia blasts to cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-3. However, Smac failed to overcome Apaf-1-deficiency-mediated resistance to cytochrome c in primary leukaemic blasts. In summary, this study reveals that Smac/DIABLO exhibits a potential role in increasing apoptosis and suppressing proliferation in human leukaemic cells. Importantly, it also indicates that it is crucial to evaluate the levels of Apaf-1 and XIAP proteins in patient samples before using Smac peptide therapy in the treatment of human leukaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2029114223,"Two competitive inhibitors of TAFIa (activated thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor), 2-guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid and potato tuber carboxypeptidase inhibitor, variably affect fibrinolysis of clotted human plasma. Depending on their concentration, the inhibitors shortened, prolonged, or had no effect on lysis in vitro. The inhibitor-induced effects were both tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and TAFIa concentration-dependent. Inhibitor-dependent prolongation was favored at lower tPA concentrations. The magnitude of the prolongation increased with TAFIa concentration, and the maximal prolongation observed at each TAFIa concentration increased saturably with respect to TAFIa.

Blood. 1999; 94: 2735-2743Google Scholar), we investigated the effectiveness of GEMSA and PTCI as profibrinolytic agents in the lysis of clots formed in normal human plasma. We found that the two inhibitors exhibited complex behavior. High concentrations of the inhibitors shortened lysis times. Unexpectedly, low concentrations of the inhibitors prolonged fibrinolysis by 3-fold (coincidently, an abstract describing this paradoxical behavior was recently presented by Schneider (18Schneider M.M. Nesheim M.E. Blood. 2001; 98 (Abstr. 1067): 254aGoogle Scholar)). Therefore, the work described in this report was undertaken to investigate the relationships between competitive TAFIa inhibitors, TAFIa, tPA, and fibrinolysis in an effort to understand the complex behavior exhibited by the competitive inhibitors of TAFIa in anin vitro system. l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (PC),l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), andl-α-phosphatidylserine (PS) were obtained in chloroform from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The TAFIa substrates 3-(2-furyl)acryloyl-Ala-Arg-OH (FAAR) and 3-(2-Furyl)acryloyl-Ala-Lys-OH (FAAK) were obtained from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA). The TAFIa inhibitor 2-guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid (GEMSA) and the thrombin inhibitor Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (PPAck) were obtained fromCalbiochem (San Diego, CA). The potato tuber carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PTCI) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Rabbit lung thrombomodulin (TM) was obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Lipid reconstituted, recombinant tissue factor (TF), RecombiPlasTin, was from Instrumentation Laboratory (Lexington, MA). Human thrombin was a generous gift from Dr. M. E. Nesheim (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). TAFI and TAFIa were prepared as previously described (7Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3138-3148Google Scholar, 17Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Google Scholar). The recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), Activase, was a kind gift from Dr. Gordon Vehar at Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Pooled normal human plasma (NHP) was produced from anticoagulated (1/10 acid/citrate/dextrose) whole blood from nine donors. TAFI-deficient plasma (TdP) was prepared from NHP by immunodepletion of TAFI as previously described (17Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Google Scholar). PC:PE:PS (60:20:20, v/v) phospholipid vesicles were made using the procedure of Barenholz et al.(19Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Google Scholar). All lysis assays were carried out at 37 °C in Dynex Immulon 1B Removawell strips (Thermo-Labsystems, Franklin, MA). Assays were initiated by the addition of a 60-μl aliquot, consisting of 25 μl of 0.02 m Hepes/0.15 m NaCl/0.01% Tween 80 (HBST) plus 35 μl of either NHP or TdP, to a 40-μl aliquot containing the variable constituents (CaCl2, tPA, thrombin, TM, PC:PE:PS vesicles, TF, TAFI, TAFIa, GEMSA, or PTCI) of the assay. The effect of the competitive inhibitors GEMSA and PTCI on the tPA-induced lysis of clots made in NHP was assessed as follows. NHP containing either PTCI (0–500 nm) or GEMSA (0–1 mm) was clotted with 3 nm thrombin in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, 5 nm TM, 1/800 dilution of TF, 15 μm PC:PE:PS vesicles, and 0.02–0.08 μg/ml tPA. The TM, TF, and PC:PE:PS vesicles were included in these assays to promote the rapid and complete activation of TAFI to TAFIa in situ. The effect of GEMSA and PTCI on the tPA-induced lysis of clots made in TdP supplemented with TAFIa was assessed as follows. TdP containing GEMSA (0–3 mm) or PTCI (0–1 μm) was clotted with 3 nm thrombin in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, 5 nmTM, 0.02 μg/ml tPA, and 0–100 nm TAFIa. For all experiments, the plates were sealed with clear tape and the turbidity of the clots at 405 nm was monitored at 37 °C using a SpectraMax Platereader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The lysis time, the time at which the turbidity equals one-half of the full-scale value, of each clot was determined. TAFIa (20 nm) in HBST/5 mm CaCl2 was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of GEMSA (0–200 μm). Samples (220 μl) were taken at 0, 10, 25, 60, and 120 min and placed on wet ice to prevent further decay. The TAFIa activity of each sample was determined at the end of the experiment using the chromolytic TAFIa substrate FAAR. The TAFIa samples (100 μl) were mixed with 100 μl of FAAR (2 mm, in HBST) in the wells of a microtiter plate, and the absorbance (340 nm) of duplicate reactions was monitored continuously over 3 h at 26 °C. The initial rate of absorbance decrease for each reaction was measured, and the data obtained at each concentration of GEMSA were fit to the decay equation, ratet=ratet=0×e−kt+CEquation 1 where rate t is the rate of decrease of absorbance at 340 nm (FAAR hydrolysis) after incubation at 37 °C fort minutes, rate t= 0 is the rate of FAAR hydrolysis prior to incubation at 37 °C, kis the decay constant, t is the time in minutes, andC is the intrinsic rate of FAAR hydrolysis. The half-life (t 12) of TAFIa at each concentration of GEMSA was obtained from Equation 1 using the following relationship. t1/2=ln(2)kEquation 2 Of the models that could be used to fit the data for the spontaneous decay process or inactivation of TAFIa, the one that fit our data the best was one where the decay of TAFIa requires an empty active site. TAFIa+I⇄TAFIa·Ik↓TAFIai REACTION1In this model, the parameters I, TAFIai, and k represent the inhibitor, the inactive decayed TAFIa, and the decay constant, respectively. Because the decay of TAFIa is spontaneous, the rate of decay is directly proportional to the concentration of TAFIa where k is the decay constant. d[TAFIa]dt=−k×[TAFIa]Equation 3 When only unoccupied TAFIa can decay, the rate of decay of TAFIa in the presence of a competitive inhibitor is therefore proportional to [TAFIa]free, d[TAFIa]dt=−k×[TAFIa]freeEquation 4 or d[TAFIa]dt=−k×fTAFIa×[TAFIa]Equation 5 where f TAFIa is the fraction of TAFIa free. Solving for [TAFIa] yields, [TAFIa]=eCe−ktfTAFIaEquation 6 where C is a constant of integration. Whent = 0, [TAFIa] = [TAFIa]o, and therefore, [TAFIa]=[TAFIa]0e−ktfTAFIa.Equation 7 The half-life, t 12, of TAFIa in the presence of a competitive inhibitor is, therefore, t1/2=ln(2)kfTAFIaEquation 8 For a given concentration of TAFIa and inhibitor (I), [TAFIa]free is related to [I]free and K I through the following, KI=[TAFIa]free×[I]free[TAFIa·I]Equation 9 or KI=[TAFIa]free×[I]free[TAFIa]bound.Equation 10 Because TAFIatotal=TAFIafree+TAFIaboundEquation 11 then KI=[TAFIa]free×[I]free[TAFIa]total−[TAFIa]free.Equation 12 When [I]total ≫ [TAFIa]total (i.e. in the case of GEMSA), then [I]free ≅ [I]total. Thus, KI=[TAFIa]free×[I]total[TAFIa]total−[TAFIa]free.Equation 13 Solving for [TAFIa]free yields, [TAFIa]free=[TAFIa]total×KI[I]total+KIEquation 14 and dividing out by [TAFIa]total, we obtain the fraction of TAFIa free (f TAFIa), fTAFIa=11+([I]total/KI).Equation 15 Substitution of Equation 15 into Equation 7 yields the exponential decay (Equation 16) and the half-life (Equation 17) of TAFIa in the presence of a competitive inhibitor when [I] ≫ [TAFIa], [TAFIa]=[TAFIa]0e−kt/(1+[I]/KI)Equation 16 t1/2=t1/20+t1/20[I]KIEquation 17 where t 1/20 is the half-life of TAFIa in the absence of inhibitor. A plot of t 12 versus the concentration of inhibitor yields a straight line whose intercept equals t 1/20 and whose slope equals t 1/20/K I. The data from the experiments using GEMSA were fit globally to Equation 16 using the Systat program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). TAFIa (20 nm) in HBST/5 mm CaCl2 was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of PTCI (0–70 nm). Samples (400 μl) were taken at 0, 5, 10, 25, and 60 min and placed on wet ice to prevent further decay. The TAFIa activity of each sample was determined at the end of the experiment, using the chromolytic TAFIa substrate FAAK, as follows. Duplicate samples (180 μl) were mixed with 20 μl of FAAK (10 mm, in HBST) in the wells of a microtiter plate, and the absorbance of the reactions at 340 nm was monitored continuously over 3 h at 26 °C. The initial rate of absorbance decrease for each reaction was determined. According to Reaction 1, the decay of TAFIa is dependent on [TAFIa]free, which is determined from the equilibrium binding equation (Equation 10). In the case of the experiments using PTCI, however, the assumption that [I]free ≅ [I]totalis not valid, and therefore, unlike the case where GEMSA was used, the fraction of TAFIa that is TAFIafree changes over time. Thus, our experiments using PTCI were not modeled using EquationsEquation 15, Equation 16, Equation 17. However, from Equation 4, the rate of decay is simply proportional to [TAFIa]free. Using the mass action relationship in Equation 11, Equation 10 can be rewritten as follows. KI=([TAFIa]total−[TAFIa]bound)×([I]total−[TAFIa]bound)[TAFIa]boundEquation 18 Solving for [TAFIa]bound yields a quadratic whose solution is, [TAFIa]bound=0.5×(KI+[TAFIa]total+[I]total−(KI+[TAFIa]total+[I]total)2−4([TAFIa]total×[I]total))Equation 19 substitution into Equation 4 (using Equation 11) yields the generalized rate of TAFIa decay in the presence of a competitive inhibitor. d[TAFIa]dt=−k×[[TAFIa]total−0.5×(KI+[TAFIa]total+[I]total−(KI+[TAFIa]total+[I]total)2−4([TAFIa]total×[I]total))]Equation 20 The data from the experiments using PTCI were fit iteratively to Equation 20. Briefly, [TAFIa]free was determined at time = t from [TAFIa]total, [I]total, and K I; [TAFIa]free then decayed exponentially for dtseconds with decay constant k; [TAFIa]total at time t + dt was determined by subtracting the decayed TAFIa; [TAFIa]free was determined at time =t + dt. This cycle was repeated for a total time of 60 min using a time interval (dt) of 0.1 s. The decay constantk (and thus t 1/20 for TAFIa) and the K I value for PTCI were determined by non-linear regression of the observed data to the iteratively calculated data (varying k and K I) using the Solver tool in Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA). The intrinsic fluorescence of TAFIa was monitored over time at 30 °C or 37 °C in the presence and absence of both GEMSA (20, 40, 50, and 100 μm) or PTCI (120, 180, and 240 nm). In some experiments, pre-activated TAFIa (4 μm) was added to HSBT/5 mm CaCl2 in a stirred, thermostatted, acrylic cuvette in the presence and absence of GEMSA and PTCI to give a final TAFIa concentration of 100 nm. In other experiments, 100 nm TAFI in HBST/5 mm CaCl2 was activated to TAFIa by 50 nm thrombin, 50 nm TM in the presence and absence of GEMSA and PTCI in a stirred, thermostatted, acrylic cuvette. The activation was initiated by the addition of thrombin. Activation of TAFI to TAFIa under these conditions was essentially complete by 60 s. The thrombin in the reaction was quenched with PPAck (275 nm final) at 90 s. The fluorescence intensity of the samples was monitored in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B fluorescence spectrophotometer using λex = 280 nm, slit = 5 nm, λem = 340 nm, slit = 4.5 nm with a 290-nm emission filter in place. Samples (110 μl) were removed at various times from the reactions, added to 110 μl of ice-cold HBST/5 mm CaCl2, placed on ice until the end of the experiment, and then assayed for FAAK activity as described above. TAFIa (10 nm) was mixed with GEMSA (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μm) or PTCI (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 nm), and the initial rate of hydrolysis of FAAR (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 mm) in the presence of the various concentrations of inhibitor was determined as above. The data was non-linearly regressed to the Michaelis-Menten equation describing competitive inhibition, rate=Vmax×[FAAR]KM1+[I]KI+[FAAR]Equation 21 where I is the concentration of the inhibitor, using the Systat program. The lysis of clots formed from NHP in the presence of various concentrations of tPA was studied in the presence and absence of various concentrations of GEMSA and PTCI, two competitive inhibitors of TAFIa. Fig.1 shows the variable effect of GEMSA (panel A) and PTCI (panel B) on the lysis of clots in NHP with 0.08 μg/ml tPA. Compared with the lysis profiles seen in the absence of inhibitors (Fig. 1, circles), both inhibitors could either prolong (squares) or shorten (triangles) lysis, depending on the concentration of the inhibitor. The concentration dependence of tPA on inhibitor-mediated prolongation of lysis was investigated. Fig.2 shows the effect of GEMSA (panel A) and PTCI (panel B) on the lysis time of clots formed from NHP using 0.02–0.08 μg/ml tPA. In addition, the figure shows the lysis time in the presence of GEMSA (panel C) and PTCI (panel D) relative to the lysis time in the absence of inhibitor. The figure also shows that both competitive inhibitors exhibit a complex, bell-shaped behavior with respect to plasma clot lysis. Over the concentration ranges of tPA and inhibitor used, both GEMSA (panel C) and PTCI (panel D) can prolong, shorten, or display no effect on the lysis time. For example, at a PTCI concentration of 100 nm, the lysis times were prolonged 3.1-fold, 2.0-fold, and 1.4-fold at 0.02, 0.04, and 0.08 μg/ml tPA, respectively. However, at 500 nm PTCI, the lysis times were longer at 0.02 μg/ml tPA (1.5-fold) but shorter at 0.04 and 0.08 μg/ml tPA (0.78-fold and 0.48-fold, respectively). The data show that the effect (prolongation or shortening) of a competitive inhibitor on the lysis time of clots formed from NHP is dependent on the concentration of both the inhibitor and tPA, with lower concentrations of tPA promoting the prolongation of lysis at any given inhibitor concentration.Figure 2The effect of competitive inhibitors on lysis is dependent on both the inhibitor and tPA concentrations. Clots were formed from NHP in the presence of various concentrations of either GEMSA (A and C) or PTCI (B andD) at 0.02 (●), 0.04 (○), and 0.08 (▾) μg/ml tPA. The data (average of duplicates) are presented as the absolute (A and B) and relative (C andD) lysis times at each concentration of tPA and inhibitor. The figure shows that both inhibitors display complex behavior over the range of tPA and inhibitor concentrations used and that, for any given inhibitor concentration, decreasing tPA promotes the inhibitor-dependent prolongation of fibrinolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to verify that the inhibitor-induced prolongation was both specific for TAFIa and not due to differences in the rates of TAFIa formation by thrombin-TM, the lysis times of clots formed from TdP supplemented with 0.02 μg/ml tPA and various concentrations of TAFIa were determined in the absence and presence of either GEMSA or PTCI. Fig. 3shows that in the absence of GEMSA (panel A) and PTCI (panel B), the TAFIa-dependent prolongation is saturable, with the half-maximal effect observed below 5 nm. The dependence of lysis time on the inhibitor concentration displayed similar behavior for each TAFIa concentration; as the inhibitor concentration is increased from zero the lysis time increases to some maximum value, the magnitude of which increases with increasing TAFIa concentration. Once the maximum lysis time is attained, any further increase in the inhibitor concentration decreases the lysis time. To understand the behavior of the system with respect to TAFIa concentration, we plotted the maximum prolongation observed, relative to the lysis time seen in the absence of TAFIa,versus the input TAFIa concentration. As shown in Fig.4, the maximum prolongation observed at each TAFIa concentration in the presence of both GEMSA and PTCI appears saturable with respect to TAFIa concentration. Thus, the data from each inhibitor was non-linearly regressed, using the Systat program, to the rectangular hyperbola,Figure 4The prolongation effect is saturable with respect to TAFIa. The maximum relative prolongation (the largest -fold increase in lysis time observed in the presence of an inhibitor) at each TAFIa concentration in Fig. 3 was plotted against the input TAFIa concentration for the experiments using GEMSA (●) and PTCI (▾). The figure shows that the maximum relative prolongation is a function of TAFIa concentration and that this effect is saturable. Thelines show the fit of the data to a rectangular hyperbola (Equation 22) and indicate that the maximal relative prolongation for TAFIa (i.e. -fold prolongation at infinite TAFIa) is ∼20-fold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) P[TAFIa]=1+Pmax×[TAFIa]THalfMax+[TAFIa]Equation 22 where P [TAFIa] is the maximum relative prolongation observed at a given TAFIa concentration,P max is the maximal relative prolongation (i.e. the lysis time expected at infinite TAFIa concentration relative to the lysis time seen in the absence of TAFIa), and T HalfMax is the TAFIa concentration required to yield a prolongation equal to one-half ofP max. The regression yieldedP max values of 23 ± 3-fold and 21 ± 3-fold and T HalfMax values of 85 ± 17 and 110 ± 24 nm for GEMSA and PTCI, respectively. It should be noted that the maximum prolongation observed at any given TAFIa concentration is not dependent on the inhibitorK I but on the concentration of inhibitor present relative to K I, i.e. the maximum prolongation occurs when the inhibitor is present at some -fold overK I. Thus, the values of P maxand T HalfMax are also independent ofK I. The regression curves are shown in Fig. 4. TAFIa was incubated with various concentrations of either GEMSA or PTCI at 37 °C and timed samples were taken and assayed for TAFIa activity. Fig. 5 shows the TAFIa activity (panels A and B) and the fraction of initial TAFIa activity (panels C andD) versus the time of incubation at 37 °C in the presence of various concentrations of GEMSA (panels Aand C) and PTCI (panels B and D). The figure shows the data points (symbols) as well as the fits of the data (lines) to Equation 16 for GEMSA and, iteratively, to Equation 20 for PTCI. That the iterative approach provided reasonable estimates of t 1/20 andK I for the experiments using PTCI is supported by the agreement between the estimates obtained for GEMSA using Equation16 (t 1/20 = 9.2 min, K I = 36 μm) and those obtained, iteratively, using Equation 20(t 1/20 = 9.1 min, K I = 41 μm). The figure shows that the inhibition of TAFIa activity by GEMSA and PTCI (panels A and B) is accompanied by a stabilization of TAFIa (panels C andD), resulting in a decreased rate of TAFIa decay. The values for t 1/20 and K I derived from the decay experiments, as well as the measuredK I values for both inhibitors, are shown in TableI. To determine the relationship between the inhibitor concentration, the inhibitor K I, and the decay of TAFIa for both GEMSA and PTCI, we determined the apparent half-life of TAFIa (t 1/2app) at each inhibitor concentration by fitting each decay curve (Fig. 5,C and D) to an exponential decay (Equation 1) and plotted t 1/2app versus the fraction of TAFIa bound at each inhibitor concentration. Although the decay of TAFIa activity with PTCI was not truly exponential (see “Experimental Procedures”), the fit curves (Fig. 5 D,dashed lines) show that a single exponential closely approximates the decay, and, therefore, the derivation oft 1/2app by this analysis is reasonable. Fig.6 shows the effect of GEMSA (circles) and PTCI (triangles) on the apparent half-life of TAFIa versus the fraction of TAFIa bound at each of the inhibitor concentrations. The fraction of TAFIa bound was calculated from Equation 19 using K I values derived from the models (closed symbols) or fromK I values determined independently (open symbols). The figure shows that, regardless of the method used to determine the K I, both inhibitors exert the same effect on the decay of TAFIa when the inhibitors are used at concentrations that yield the same fraction of TAFIa bound. Therefore, the extent of stabilization of TAFIa by any given concentration of a competitive inhibitor is directly related to K I.Table IThe half-life of TAFIa and the KI for GEMSA and PTCICalculatedMeasuredt 1/20 of TAFIaK IK IminnmGEMSA9.2 ± 0.235,800 ± 1,80013,700 ± 1,900PTCI9.11-aThe Solver program (Microsoft Excel) used to iteratively calculate the values for PTCI does not return standard error values.10.21-aThe Solver program (Microsoft Excel) used to iteratively calculate the values for PTCI does not return standard error values.3.7 ± 0.6The table shows the half-life of TAFIa and the K Ivalue for each inhibitor determined from modeling the data from the experiments to Equation 16 (GEMSA) using the Systat program (±S.E.) or Equation 20 (PTCI) using the Solver program (Microsoft Excel).

It is well established that the inhibition of TAFIa, an attenuator of fibrinolysis, results in the potentiation of tPA-induced clot lysisin vitro (17Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B.

https://openalex.org/W2029517172,"The promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that localizes to distinct domains in the nucleus, described as PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). Recent findings indicate that PML regulates the p53 response to oncogenic signals. Here, we define a p53-dependent role for PML in response to DNA damage. We exposed cells to ultraviolet light (UV-C) and imaged the nuclear distribution of PML, p53, and the BLM helicase by confocal microscopy. After DNA damage, PML partially relocated out of the PML-NBs, and colocalized with BLM and p53 at sites of DNA repair. In addition, using the isogenic HCT116 cell lines (p53+/+ and -/-), we show that the redistribution of PML was dependent on functional p53. Western analysis revealed that the level of PML protein remained unaltered after UV-C treatment. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PML, in conjunction with p53 and BLM, contributes to the cellular response to UV-C-induced DNA damage and its repair."
https://openalex.org/W2074976063,"NF-κB/Rel transcription factors play essential roles to mediate the immune response and apoptosis, and they have also been implicated in cellular differentiation such as erythropoiesis. To elucidate the possible role(s) of NF-κB in erythroid gene regulation and erythropoiesis, we have carried out transient transfection studies of the human embryonic/fetal erythroid cell line K562 and mouse adult erythroid MEL cells. It is shown that tumor necrosis factor-α represses the transcription activity directed by either α or ζ globin promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, different NF-κB family members could effectively repress the transfected α-like globin promoters in K562 as well as in MEL cells. The involvement of NF-κB pathway is supported by the ability of a NF-κB-specific, dominant negative mutant to block the tumor necrosis factor-α or p65-mediated suppression of the α-like globin promoter activities. The suppression appears to be mediated through cis-linked HS-40 enhancer. Finally, stably transfected K562 cells overexpressing p65 contain reduced amounts of the p45/NF-E2 RNA and functional NF-E2 proteins. Our studies have identified a new set of targets of NF-κB. We suggest that the relatively high activity of the NF-κB pathway in early erythroid progenitors is involved in the suppression of erythroid-specific genes. Later in differentiation, together with other changes, the decline of the amounts of the NF-κB family of factors leads to derepression and consequent increase of NF-E2, which in turn would activate a subset of erythroid-specific genes.

The mammalian α-like (embryonic ζ, adult α2, α1, and τ) and β-like (embryonic ϵ, fetal γG and γA, adult δ and β) globin gene clusters together have provided a paradigm for the analysis of coordinated and differential gene expression. Understanding the molecular basis of human globin gene switch during development would also provide essential knowledge and alternative therapeutic strategies for the treatment of severe hemoglobinopathies including sickle cell anemia and thalassemias (1Stamatoyannopoulos G.

Roder K. Hu K.Y. Rombel I. Gavva N.R. Daftari P. Kuo Y.Y. Wang C. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and 9Rombel I. Hu K.Y. Zhang Q.

Among the DNA-binding proteins known to function in globin gene regulation are the erythroid-enriched transcription factors NF-E2 (10Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), GATA-1 (11Tsai S.F. Martin P.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H.

There are also cofactors that physically interact with the above DNA-binding transcription factors, for example, FOG (13Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and chromatin remodeling complexes (14Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5634-5644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When compared with other gene systems, relatively little is known about the signal transduction pathways regulating the globin gene transcription. One study in human primary erythroid progenitors and the human embryonic/fetal erythroid cell line K562 showed that IL-6 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GH, growth hormone; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Luc, luciferase. down-regulated the γ globin mRNA level. However, the molecular basis of this repression remains unknown (15Ferry A.E. Baliga S.B. Monteiro C. Pace B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20030-20037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Another transgenic mice study has shown that a NF-κB-binding motif at the 3′ side of the human ζ globin gene is required for its complete silencing in the adult mice (16Wang Z. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2218-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it has been implicated that serine-threonine phosphorylation might regulate the activity of NF-E2 (17Garingo A.D. Suhasini M. Andrews N.C. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9169-9177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Nagai T. Igarashi K. Akasaka J. Furuyama K. Fujita H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Sassa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5358-5365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). NF-κB/Rel is a family of potent inducible regulatory factors consisting of p65/RelA, p50(p105), p52(p100), RelB, and c-Rel (Refs. 19Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar and 20Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar and references therein). The NF-κB pathway could be activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli to regulate the expression of genes required for immune and inflammatory responses, for cell growth and differentiation, as well as for suppressing apoptosis (21Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 22Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In general, upon stimuli such as exposure to the various cytokines, the IκB inhibitory proteins are phosphorylated and degraded. The liberated NF-κB is then translocated to the nucleus, binds to specific κB elements (GGGRNNYYCC), and modulates by gene transcription. More recently, several lines of evidence have suggested that NF-κB also plays a crucial role in erythropoiesis (24Zhang M.Y. Sun S.C. Bell L. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 4136-4144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RelB knockout mice develop normally but exhibit abnormalities in hematopoiesis and multiorgan inflammation (25Weih F. Carrasco D. Durham S.K. Barton D.S. Rizzo C.A. Ryseck R.P. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Cell. 1995; 80: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Rel/RelA-deficient mice displayed multiple hematopoietic cell defects and erythropoiesis impairment (26Grossmann M. Metcalf D. Merryfull J. Beg A. Baltimore D. Gerondakis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11848-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Also, NF-κB subunits p65, p50, and p52 are all expressed during early normal erythroid proliferation (day 7–10 erythroblasts), and their levels decline during differentiation (24Zhang M.Y. Sun S.C. Bell L. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 4136-4144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also postulated (24Zhang M.Y. Sun S.C. Bell L. Miller B.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 4136-4144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that NF-κB factors modulate the erythropoiesis via its downstream target genes, c-myb and c-myc, the expression of which are required for the erythroid development (27Lee H.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We show below that activation of the NF-κB pathway in two different types of erythroid cells represses the expression of the α-like globin genes. We have also carried out experiments to investigate the molecular basis of this NF-κB-mediated repression. Plasmids—The reporter constructs pHS40-ζ597GH, pHS40-α590GH, and their mutated versions have been described previously (8Wen S.C. Roder K. Hu K.Y. Rombel I. Gavva N.R. Daftari P. Kuo Y.Y. Wang C. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Rombel I. Hu K.Y. Zhang Q. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Shen C.-K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6454-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The constructions of pHS40-α590Luc and pHS40-ζ597Luc were done in the following way. First, a SacI/XbaI fragment encompassing the HS-40 enhancer from pBS-HS40-α590GH was ligated with SacI/NheI-cut pGL3 (Promega) to create pGL3-HS40. Then a blunt PstI-NcoI fragment containing the α1 globin promoter sequence from -574 to +41 was ligated with HindIII/NcoI-cut pGL3-HS40 after the HindIII end was made blunt, thus generating pHS40-α590Luc. To construct pHS40-ζ597Luc, a SacI/BamHI fragment containing the HS-40 enhancer and ζ2 globin promoter from pHS40-ζ597GH was cloned into the SacI/BglII sites of pGL3. p65 cDNA, amplified by RT-PCR, was inserted between the XbaI and KpnI sites of pJ3H to get pJ3H-Hap65 encoding a Hap65 fusion protein. The HindIII/KpnI fragment from pJ3H-Hap65 was inserted in-frame into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), resulting in pEGFP-HAp65 directing the synthesis of GFP-HA-tagged p65 fusion under the control of CMV promoter. pGL3-α(-87/+41)Luc was constructed by ligating a SmaI/NcoI fragment encompassing the α1 globin promoter from -87 to +41 with SmaI/NcoI-cut pGL3. pGL3-(NA)2α(-87/+41)Luc contains two tandem NF-E2/AP1-binding sites cloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-α(-87/+41)Luc. pRSV-p45 and pRSV-p18 expression plasmids were constructed by cloning of fragments flanked by HindIII sites and containing the full coding regions of p45 and p18, respectively, into pRc/RSV (Invitrogen). pCMVp65, pJ3H, and pCMV-IκB(S32A/S36A), also termed pCMV-IκBαA32A36 (see Fig. 1), were kindly provided by Dr. Greene (30Ballard D.W.

A. 1971; 68: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °Cin RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen). For transient DNA transfection, the seeding density of K562 cells was 2.5–3.0 × 105/ml at 5 h prior to the transfection. For MEL cells, it was 5 × 105/ml at 1 day before transfection. A total of 2–3 × 106 (K562) or 5 × 106 (MEL) cells were collected by centrifugation and then resuspension in 0.4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing the indicated number of micrograms of the expression constructs plus 1 or 2 μg of the luciferase or GH reporter plasmids. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant with the addition of the cloning vectors. Electroporation was carried out with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at a capacity of 975 microfarads and 250 mV (K562) or 300–350 mV (MEL). The transfected cells were kept in 6-well culture plates for 24 h for the luciferase assay and 48 h for the growth hormone assay. Unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends, the transfection data represent the averages of at least three independent experiments. For the cytokine induction, 50 ng/ml of recombinant human TNF-α and IL-6 (R&D Systems) were added to the culture medium at 5–6 h post-transfection. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before the assays. For hemin induction, 25 μm of hemin (Sigma) were added to the culture medium at a cell density of 2–4 × 105/ml, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days before the assays. For the establishment of stable K562 pools overexpressing p65, K562 cells were transfected with pEGFP-HAp65. The clones were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml of active G418 for 2 weeks. GFP-positive cells were then sorted out by flow cytometry as follows. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, washed by resuspension in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and recentrifugated. The washed cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and 5% fetal bovine serum and then sorted with a FACStar-plus instrument (Becton Dickinson). Propidium iodide (0.1 μg/ml) was added to restrict the sorting to living cells. The control cell pool, K(V), was generated in the same manner as above, except that the vector pEGFP-C1 was transfected and stably integrated. The sorted cells were maintained in the presence of 400 μg/ml of active G418 for use in further assays. Two pools, K(p65) and K(p65)′, independently selected and sorted in this way were analyzed for the expression levels of their α, ζ, p45/NF-E2, and control genes. Of the two pools with p65 overexpression, K(p65) was further characterized in more detail by EMSA and DNA transfection. GH Assay—Forty-eight hours after DNA transfection, the levels of human GH secreted into the media by the transfected cells were quantified with the Allegro human GH radioimmunoassay kit as described previously. In cotransfection assays of Figs. 2, 3, 4, the GH values were normalized with the protein contents because coexpressed p65 or IκB would affect the CMV promoter activity of the commonly used internal plasmid pCMV-CAT or pRSV-CAT.Fig. 3Suppression of the α globin promoter by NF-κB through the HS-40 element. The effects of coexpression of p65, IκBαAA, or both on the α globin promoters in pα590 GH and pHS40-α590GH were assayed by transient transfection. For each cotransfection, 2 μg of the reporter plasmid(s) and 5 μg of the expression plasmid(s) or the vector were used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Suppression of α globin promoter by NF-κB through cis-linked NF-E2/AP1binding sites.

They were isolated by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice by resuspension in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and recentrifugation. The extracts were prepared by first lysis of the cells in appropriate amounts of a reporter lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The luciferase measurements were done on a luminometer (LKB1251). The values of the luciferase activities were also normalized to the protein concentrations, which were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard (Bio-Rad). Relative luciferase activities were indicated as the average values with the standard deviation. Western and Northern Blot Analyses—K562, K(V), K(p65), and K(p65)′ cells at the density of 1–2 × 106 cells/ml were first arrested in 0.5% serum RPMI 1640 for 24–36 h. After 12–24 h of serum stimulation, the cells were harvested for Northern blot analysis of the levels of globin RNAs. For Northern and Western blot analysis of the p45/NF-EL expression, serum stimulation of the cells was for 2–3 and 6–12 h, respectively. The blot hybridization procedures essentially followed Sambrook et al. (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, the extracts were prepared by cell lysis in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 50 μgof the total protein were separated with SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Millipore), and hybridized with antisera against HA (Roche Applied Science), p45, p65, and α-tubulin (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. The immunocomplexes were detected by the reaction with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blot analysis, total RNAs were extracted by means of a commercial Trizole reagent (Invitrogen). 10 μg of each RNA sample were separated on a 1.0% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with DNA fragments amplified by PCR and containing α globin, ζ globin, and β-actin cDNA, respectively. A 1.0-kb HindIII fragment containing human p45 cDNA was also used as the probe. The probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. After overnight hybridization at 42 °C with standard buffer containing 50% formamide, the blot was washed successfully in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS once and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. The blots were subjected to autoradiography or direct quantitation with a PhosphorImager. EMSA—The nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Dignam et al. (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). All of the DNA binding reactions were performed using 10 μg of nuclear extracts in a volume of 20 μl of reaction mixture. The binding reaction for the IgκB site was carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. 3.2 mm MgCl2 was included in the reaction mixtures for NF-E2 or NF-Y binding. For Sp1 binding, the reaction mixture contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The oligonucleotides used are as follows: IgκB, 5′-tcgacAGTTGAGGGACTTTCCCAGGCg-3′/3′-cGCCTGGGAAAGTCCCTCAACTgtcga-5′; mutated IgκB, 5′-tcgacAGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGCg-3′/3′-agctgcGCCTGGGAAAGTCCGCTCAACTc-5′; 3′-NA, 5′-gatccAGGATGACTCAGCAGTCCTg-3′/3′-cAGGACTGCTGAGTCATCCTggatc-5′; Sp1, 5′-ctagaATTCGATCGGGGCGGGCGAGCg-3′/3′-cGCTCGCCCGCCCCGATCGAATtctg-5′; and NF-Y, 5′-tcgacCGTACGTGATTGGTTAATCTCTTg-3′/3′-cAAGAGATTAACCAATCACGTACGgtcga-5′. These oligonucleotides were synthesized with 5′ overhangs and end-labeled by Klenow enzyme with [α-32P]dCTP for IgκB and NF-Y or with [α-32P]d-ATP for 3′-NA and Sp1. The binding reactions were conducted at room temperature for 15 min. The samples were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide, 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA gel and electrophoresed at 200 mV at 4 °C. For the competition studies, 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was included in the binding reaction. For supershift analysis, 1 μg of antisera each for p65, p50, IκB, and c-Jun, 3 μg for Sp1 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 1 μl of anti-p45 or the preimmune serum were individually incubated with the nuclear extracts at room temperature for 10 min prior to their use in the binding reactions. Activation of the NF-κB Pathway Represses Human α and ζ Globin Promoters—Transient transfection was used to test whether the NF-κB pathway might be involved in the regulation of the α-like globin gene expression. The human erythroleukemia cell line K562 was transfected with the reporter plasmids pHS40-α590Luc or pHS40-ζ597Luc. At 5–6 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with TNF-α or IL-6, respectively, for 24 h prior to the reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with TNF-α but not IL-6 reduced the luciferase activity of either ζ (Fig. 1A) or α (Fig. 1B) globin promoter. To further examine whether TNF-α exerted this effect through the NF-κB pathway, the cells were cotransfected with pCMV-IκBα(S32A/S36A). This plasmid, termed pCMV-IκBαA32A36 in the following, expresses IκBα(S32A/S36A), also known as IκBαAA or IκB, which inhibits TNF-α- or IL-1-induced NF-κB activation (37Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2532-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Indeed, TNF-α-mediated repression of the human ζ and α globin promoters was relieved by cotransfection of pCMV-IκBαA32A36 (Fig. 1). These data together suggested that activation of the NF-κB pathway by TNF-α could suppress the transcriptional activities of transfected human α-like globin promoters in K562 cells. The functional roles of NF-κB subunits in suppressing the human α-like globin promoters were further studied by the cotransfection assay. Consistent with Fig. 1, a dose-dependent suppressive effect by p65 in K562 cells was observed when either growth hormone (Fig. 2A) or luciferase (Fig. 2B) was used as the reporter. In particular, cotransfection with 10 μg of pCMV-p65 decreased the ζ and α promoter activities by 90 and 80%, respectively (Fig. 2A, middle bars). Although IκBαAA by itself had no effect, coexpression of this subunit reversed the p65-mediated suppression of either globin promoter (Fig. 2A, top two bars). These data indicate that p65 could down-regulate the transcriptional activities of the human ζ and α globin promoters through the NF-κB pathway. Cotransfection of MEL cells with pHS40-α590 GH and pCMV-65 gave similar results (data not shown). Members of the NF-κB Family Other Than p65 Are Also Capable of Repressing the α-Like Promoters—Similar to p65, several other NF-κB members including p50, p65-p50, and c-Rel significantly repressed the ζ globin promoter in transfected K562 cells (Fig. 2B, left panel). Coexpression of p65-p50 also repressed transfected human α globin promoter in MEL cells (Fig. 2B, right panel). In addition, the repression by these factors correlated well with the expression of NF-κB activity in the transfected cells, as measured by a NF-κB-dependent reporter assay (data not shown). Furthermore, coexpression of a dominant negative mutant of p50, p50ΔSp, had no suppression effect on the transfected globin promoters (Fig. 2B, top bars of both panels). The data of Fig. 2B indicated that the HS-40-mediated activities of the human α-like globin promoters could be repressed by activation of the NF-κB pathway through the functioning of different members of the NF-κB family. Target Sites of Suppression of the α-Like Globin Promoters by NF-κB—To determine the sites of action by the NF-κB factors to suppress the α-like globin promoters, we compared the promoter activities in transfected K562 cells in the presence or absence of the cis-linked HS-40 enhancer. Interestingly, the suppression phenomena were not seen for the enhancerless plasmid pα590GH (Fig. 3) or pζ597GH (data not shown). This result suggests that suppression by p65 or other NF-κB factors is mediated mainly through the HS-40 enhancer region instead of the promoter(s) per se. The HS-40 enhancer consists of at least five functional motifs that are bound with factors in vivo in an erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific manner (8Wen S.C. Roder K. Hu K.Y.

To examine whether the NA motifs are involved in the suppression of the HS-40 enhancer function by p65, transient transfection experiments were carried out with a reporter plasmid, pGL3-(NA)2α(-87/+41)Luc, containing two tandem copies of the NF-E2/AP1-binding sites, or NA, in front of an α globin minimal promoter. The tandem NA sites confer red activation of the reporter by coexpression of p45 and p18, i.e. NF-E2 (Fig. 4, compare top and bottom bars of left panel). Coexpression of p65 in K562 cells, on the other hand, resulted in a marked decrease of the reporter activity (Fig. 4, left panel, second bar from bottom). Similar to the experiments with pHS40-α590GH or pHS40-ζ597GH, cotransfection with IκBAA reversed the p65-mediated suppression. In contrast, the expression of p65 and/or IκBAA had little effect on the control reporter construct, pGL3-α(-87/+41)Luc, without the two NA sites (Fig. 4, right panel). The data of Fig. 4 together with Fig. 3 suggest that presence of cis-linked NA sites is both necessary and sufficient for p65-mediated repression of the α-like globin promot"
https://openalex.org/W2171062099,"Induction of myelin genes occurs around birth in the last stage of Schwann cells differentiation and is reactivated in case of nerve injury. Previous studies showed that activation of the gp130 receptor system, using as ligand interleukin-6 fused to its soluble receptor (IL6RIL6), causes induction of myelin genes such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin protein zero (Po) in embryonic dorsal root ganglia Schwann cells. We also reported that in murine melanoma B16/F10.9 cells, IL6RIL6 causes a shut-off of melanogenesis mediated by a down-regulation of the paired-homeodomain factor Pax3. The present work demonstrates that these IL6RIL6-treated F10.9 cells undergo transdifferentiation to a myelinating glial phenotype characterized by induction of the transcriptional activities of both Po and MBP promoters and accumulation of myelin gene products. For both Po and MBP promoters, a repression by Pax3 and stimulation by Sox10 can be demonstrated. Because after IL6RIL6-treatment, Pax3 disappears from the F10.9 cells (as it does in mature myelinating Schwann cells) whereas the level of Sox10 rather increases, we modulated the relative level of these factors and show their involvement in the induction of myelin gene expression by IL6RIL6. In addition, however, we show that a C/G-rich CACC box in the Po promoter is required for activation by IL6RIL6, as well as by ectopic Sox10, and identify a Kruppel-type zinc finger factor acting through this CACC box, which stimulates Po promoter activity.

Axonal myelination is a function of specialized glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the brain and myelinating Schwann cells (SC) 1The abbreviations used are: SC, Schwann cell(s); MBP, myelin basic protein; Po, protein zero; IL, interleukin; IL6R, IL-6 receptor; IL6RIL6, IL-6 fused to its soluble receptor; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; MITF, microphtalmia-associated transcription factor; RT, reverse transcription; F, forward; R, reverse; G3′PDH, glyceraldehyde 3′-phosphodehydrogenase; nt, nucleotides; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; TK, thymidine kinase 1The abbreviations used are: SC, Schwann cell(s); MBP, myelin basic protein; Po, protein zero; IL, interleukin; IL6R, IL-6 receptor; IL6RIL6, IL-6 fused to its soluble receptor; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; MITF, microphtalmia-associated transcription factor; RT, reverse transcription; F, forward; R, reverse; G3′PDH, glyceraldehyde 3′-phosphodehydrogenase; nt, nucleotides; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; TK, thymidine kinase in peripheral nerves, whose impairment in demyelinating diseases affects nerve function and integrity. Maturation of cells producing myelin occurs around birth and needs to be reactivated for repair of nerve injury (1Stoll G. Muller H.W. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 313-325Google Scholar). The developmental stages from neural crest-derived precursors to mature myelinating SC were defined by specific gene markers (see Refs.2Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Glia. 1991; 4: 185-194Google Scholar, 3Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 41: 393-402Google Scholar, 4Zorick T.S. Lemke G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 870-876Google Scholar, 5Kioussi C. Gruss P. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 84-86Google Scholar for reviews). At early stages, embryonic SC express low affinity nerve growth factor receptor, neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the transcription factors paired homeodomain Pax3, and later POU domain Octamer-6 (Oct-6)/suppressed cAMP-inducible POU (SCIP). This phenotype also characterizes the adult non-myelinating SC and reappears after nerve injury. Maturation of myelinating SC is marked by disappearance of these early markers, including Pax3, and the induction of myelin genes such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and protein zero (Po or myelin protein zero).

Thus, the high mobility group (HMG) domain Sox10, already present in early neural crest cells, activates the Po promoter (16Peirano R.I. Goerich D.E. Riethmacher D. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3198-3209Google Scholar). Krox20/Egr2, a late marker of myelinating SC differentiation required for myelination (17Topilko P. Schneider-Maunoury S. Levi G. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Chennoufi A.B. Seitanidou T. Babinet C. Charnay P. Nature. 1994; 371: 796-799Google Scholar), stimulates expression of several myelin genes (18Zorick T.S. Syroid D.E. Brown A. Gridley T. Lemke G. Development. 1999; 126: 1397-1406Google Scholar, 19Nagarajan R. Svaren J. Le N. Araki T. Watson M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 355-368Google Scholar). Conversely, Pax3 represses expression of MBP (20Kioussi C. Gross M.K. Gruss P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 553-562Google Scholar), and so does SCIP (21Monuki E.S. Kuhn R. Lemke G. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 15-32Google Scholar), in line with the need for of Pax3 and SCIP to decrease during the terminal differentiation of myelinating SC. Among extracellular factors acting on SC, only a few could be shown to activate myelin gene expression. The main SC growth factors, neuregulins nerve-derived factor (NDF)/glial growth factor (GGF) (22Dong Z. Brennan A. Liu N. Yarden Y. Lefkowitz G. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. Neuron. 1995; 15: 585-596Google Scholar), stimulate proliferation at early SC differentiation stages but have negative effects on the induction of MBP and Po genes (23Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 309-319Google Scholar). Similarly, fibroblast growth factor or transforming growth factor-β inhibit Po gene expression (24Morgan L. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Development. 1994; 120: 1399-1409Google Scholar). Axonal contacts are thought to provide positive stimuli for myelin gene expression in SC cultures (25Lemke G. Chao M. Development. 1988; 102: 499-504Google Scholar) and in transected nerves (26Trapp B.D. Hauer P. Lemke G. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 3515-3521Google Scholar). The molecules mediating these axonal cues are not well known. Intracellular cyclic AMP elevation (e.g. by forskolin) induces Po and MBP (25Lemke G. Chao M. Development. 1988; 102: 499-504Google Scholar, 27Morgan L. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 457-467Google Scholar) whereas it represses Pax3 (20Kioussi C. Gross M.K. Gruss P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 553-562Google Scholar). Activating effects of forskolin were seen on the promoters of the genes encoding myelin proteins Po (6Lemke G. Lamar E. Patterson J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 73-83Google Scholar), MBP (28Zhang X. Miskimins R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2010-2017Google Scholar, 29Li X. Wrabetz L. Cheng Y. Kamholz J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 28-40Google Scholar), and peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP-22) (30Saberan-Djoneidi D. Sanguedolce V. Assouline Z. Levy N. Passage E. Fontes M. Gene. 2000; 248: 223-231Google Scholar). Hormones, such as progesterone and glucocorticosteroids, also stimulate Po and PMP-22 promoter activities (31Desarnaud F. Do Thi A.N. Brown A.M. Lemke G. Suter U. Baulieu E.E. Schumacher M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1765-1768Google Scholar, 32Desarnaud F. Bidichandani S. Patel P.I. Baulieu E.E. Schumacher M. Brain Res. 2000; 865: 12-16Google Scholar). A third group of factors are IL-6 family cytokines that activate the gp130 receptor system. As a prototype of this large family (see Ref. 33Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Google Scholar for review), we have used a recombinant protein IL6RIL6 resulting from the fusion of IL-6 to its soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) that activates the gp130 signaling pathway in many cell types and has a high affinity for gp130 (34Chebath J. Fischer D. Kumar A. Oh J.W. Kolett O. Lapidot T. Fischer M. Rose-John S. Nagler A. Slavin S. Revel M. Eur. Cytokine Network. 1997; 8: 359-365Google Scholar, 35Kollet O. Aviram R. Chebath J. ben-Hur H. Nagler A. Shultz L. Revel M. Lapidot T. Blood. 1999; 94: 923-931Google Scholar). We showed that this gp130 activator potently stimulates the expression of MBP and Po mRNAs and proteins in cultures of mouse E14 embryonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG), as well as in derived SC (36Haggiag S. Chebath J. Revel M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 200-204Google Scholar, 37Haggiag S. Zhang P.L. Slutzky G. Shinder V. Kumar A. Chebath J. Revel M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 564-574Google Scholar). IL6RIL6 strongly down-regulated the expression of Pax3 in these embryonic cells. Moreover, IL6RIL6 enhancedin vivo the number of myelinated fibers in regenerating sciatic nerve (37Haggiag S. Zhang P.L. Slutzky G. Shinder V. Kumar A. Chebath J. Revel M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 564-574Google Scholar). Others observed that IL6RIL6 induces MBP RNA in brain cells, as well. 2M. Pizzi, personal communication. 2M. Pizzi, personal communication.The physiological relevance of these data is supported by the fact that in mice the conditional inactivation of gp130 after birth causes loss of myelin sheaths and SC defects in peripheral nerves (38Betz U.A.K. Bloch W. van den Broek M. Yoshida K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Addicks K. Rajewsky K. Muller W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1955-1965Google Scholar). We show here another system in which the gp130 activator IL6RIL6 switches on the expression of myelin genes and causes transdifferentiation of melanoma cells toward a glial phenotype. The murine melanoma B16/F10.9 cells undergo terminal growth arrest when exposed to the combination of IL-6 with its agonistic soluble IL-6 receptor (39Oh J.W. Katz A. Harroch S. Eisenbach L. Revel M. Chebath J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 569-577Google Scholar) or to the IL6RIL6 chimera (34Chebath J. Fischer D. Kumar A. Oh J.W. Kolett O. Lapidot T. Fischer M. Rose-John S. Nagler A. Slavin S. Revel M. Eur. Cytokine Network. 1997; 8: 359-365Google Scholar). There is a silencing of the melanogenic pathway because of a profound reduction in Pax3, which then down-regulates the microphtalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) gene and, in turn, the tyrosinase activity (40Kamaraju A.K. Bertolotto C. Chebath J. Revel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15132-15141Google Scholar). The present work demonstrates that IL6RIL6 subsequently induces expression of the myelin Po and MBP mRNAs through promoter-mediated transcriptional activation. This melanoma provides a new model to study the transcription factors involved in the regulation of myelin genes expression and their induction by IL-6 family cytokines. Murine B16 melanoma metastatic clone F10.9 cells (41Katz A. Shulman L.M. Porgador A. Revel M. Feldman M. Eisenbach L. J. Immunother. 1993; 13: 98-109Google Scholar, 42Porgador A. Feldman M. Eisenbach L. J. Immunogenet. 1989; 16: 291-303Google Scholar) were cultured as a monolayer at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% fetal calf serum (Biolabs, Bet Ha-Emek, Ness Ziona, Israel), supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were subcultured every 3 days at 10–30% confluency. Fused IL6RIL6 chimera was produced as described (34Chebath J. Fischer D. Kumar A. Oh J.W. Kolett O. Lapidot T. Fischer M. Rose-John S. Nagler A. Slavin S. Revel M. Eur. Cytokine Network. 1997; 8: 359-365Google Scholar, 35Kollet O. Aviram R. Chebath J. ben-Hur H. Nagler A. Shultz L. Revel M. Lapidot T. Blood. 1999; 94: 923-931Google Scholar) using mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells and immunoaffinity purification of the secreted 85-kDa protein (Interpharm, Israel). Total RNA was extracted with Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center), as recommended by the manufacturer. For RT-PCR, RNA samples (about 2 μg/assay) were reverse-transcribed with SuperscriptII (Invitrogen Molecular Biology) in the presence of oligo(dT) in 20 μl, and 2 μl of the RT reaction was used for amplification withTaq polymerase. The primers used to amplify specific mouse cDNAs were as follows: Pax3 (accession number NM_008781), forward (F): 414–438 and reverse (R): 837–861; Sox10 (AF047043), F: 924–948 and R: 1435–1459; glial fibrillary acidic protein (L27219; rat), F: 1301–1605 and R: 2175–2194; Po (mRNA sequence reconstituted from M62857–60), F: 231–255 and R: 690–714; and MBP (M15060), F: 136–156 and R: 466–485. Glyceraldehyde 3′-phosphodehydrogenase (G3′PDH) primers (Clontech) were used to verify RNA loading. Amplification conditions were 94 °C (1 min), 52–58 °C (45 s), 72 °C (1 min) for 29 cycles or for 22 cycles (G3′PDH). The sequence of PCR fragments was verified on DNA analyzer 3700 (PE Applied Biosystems, Hitachi). Real time PCR for Pax3 and Sox10 was carried out in a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) as recommended by the manufacturer. Northern blots were probed with a MBP cDNA fragment cloned, sequenced, and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming with the Rediprime-II kit (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots with rabbit anti-Sox10 antibody (CeMines) and anti-Pax3 (Geneka Biotechnology Inc.) antibodies (both at 1/2000 dilution) and with anti-CNPase mouse monoclonal antibody (1/300 dilution; Sigma) were as detailed elsewhere (40Kamaraju A.K. Bertolotto C. Chebath J. Revel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15132-15141Google Scholar). Anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 antibodies were used as control (gift of R. Seger, Weizmann Institute). RT-PCR with F10.9 total RNA was used as described (40Kamaraju A.K. Bertolotto C. Chebath J. Revel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15132-15141Google Scholar) to amplify the entire coding sequences of Pax3c cDNA (NM_008781; nt 255–1759) and Sox10 cDNA (AF047043; nt 39–1339). The cDNAs were cloned in the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid pAdRSV Krox20G (a gift of Drs. P. Charnay and P. Topilko, Paris, France) contains 5.2 kbp of Krox20 mouse genomic DNA sequence (including the complete protein coding sequence) in 3′ of Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat and in 5′ of the pIX gene polyadenylation domain. We prepared permanently transfected clones of F10.9 cells where Sox10 or Pax3 gene expression can be increased following addition of tetracycline (or doxycyclin) to the growth medium (Tet-on system). We first selected F10.9 cell clones expressing the recombinant reverse tetracycline repressor rtTA isolated from the pTet-On regulator plasmid (Clontech) cloned in pEFIRES-puro, using puromycin as before (40Kamaraju A.K. Bertolotto C. Chebath J. Revel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15132-15141Google Scholar). The clones were screened for rtTA activity, wild-type growth rate, and response to IL6RIL6 by morphological change. In the selected clone cells, we introduced the vector pSV2Hygro, together with pBI vectors containing a bidirectional Tet-regulated element (Clontech). In the pBI vectors, downstream to the Tet-regulated element, we cloned the cDNA for the green fluorescent protein, enhanced green fluorescent protein (Clontech), either alone (control) or with Sox10 or Pax3 cDNA (in the opposite direction). F10.9-rtTA cell clones growing in the presence of hygromycin and becoming fluorescent after treatment with doxycycline (200 ng/ml) were selected. Expression of the ectopic mRNAs was verified by RT-PCR, using the vector reverse primer 5′ ACTCACCCTGAAGTTCTCAG and forward primers Sox10 (AF047043; nt 924–948) or Pax3 (NM_008781; nt 850–880). The MBP reporter plasmid pBG1b (9Miura M. Tamura T. Aoyama A. Mikoshiba K. Gene. 1989; 75: 31-38Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. C. Kioussi, San Diego, CA) was excised withBglII and BspeI and blunt-ended to obtain the 5′ flanking MBP gene sequence −1320/+33. The fragment was cloned in front of the luciferase coding sequence in the pGL3 basic plasmid (Promega) cut by XhoI and HindIII, blunt-ended, to create the plasmid pGL3MBP/−1.3. The latter was cut withBglII (in 5′) and PstI (in the MBP sequence) and closed by ligation to create pGL3MBP/−0.65 or was cut with Ecl136–1 and PvuII to create pGL3MBP/−105. The rat Po promoter (6Lemke G. Lamar E. Patterson J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 73-83Google Scholar) was generated by genomic PCR, using the following primers: F, 5′-GACATTATCCCTCCCATCCCCTTATTTCCC-3′; and R, 5′-GCCCAGAGCGTCTGT-GGGGTGGAGAGAGCG-3′. After end polishing, the amplified fragment (genomic sequence −912/+45 relative to the start site) was cloned upstream of luciferase in pGL3 basic cut withSmaI to create pGL3Po-912. For pGL3Po-500, Po gene sequence −500/+45 was made by PCR with pGL3Po-912 as template and primers F, 5′-GGGGACGCGTCCAGGATGCAGGGAGATG-3′, with aMluI site (underlined); and R, 5′- GGGGAAGCTTGCCCAGAGCGTCTGTGGG-3′, with aHindIII site. The MluI/HindIII PCR fragment was inserted in pGL3 basic cut byMluI/HindIII. The other 5′ deletion plasmids were similarly prepared. For 3′ deletions of the Po promoter, the pGL3Po-300 plasmid was used as template for PCR amplification between primer F, 5′-GGGGGCTAGCTCTATCCCTCAGAGAAGT-3′, with aNheI site; and R, 5′-GGGGAGGCCTCCCCTGGATCCCCAGCAT-3′ or 5′-GGGGAGGCCTGGGGCATTGTATACTCTG-3′, with aStuI site. The amplified fragments contain sequences −299/−30 or −299/−137 of the Po promoter. All 3′ deletions were made with the same method and were introduced in front of the minimal herpes simian virus (HSV)-TK promoter (−73/+57) in the PGL3-TK plasmid cut by NheI/StuI. PGL3-TK was made by using as template a construct containing the −155/+57 sequence of HSV-TK in front of the luciferase gene in PGL3 basic. We amplified by PCR a large fragment of this plasmid by using primer F, 5′-GGGGGCTAGC AGGCCTAACACGCAGATGCAGTCGG containing in 5′ NheI (bold) and StuI (underlined) sites in front of the TK sequence from −73. The reverse primer 5′-TCTGGCATGCGAGAATCTCACGC-3′ overlapped the unique SphI site of the vector. The PCR fragment cut by NheI/SphI was cloned in PGL3 basic vector cut by NheI/SphI. Site-directed mutagenesis was done by using an Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Two primers in opposite orientation, each one carrying half of the mutated site in its 5′, were used to amplify the mutated plasmid in a single PCR reaction. Typical conditions for the PCR reaction were according to the manufacturer's protocol. Amplification conditions were 95 °C (3 min) for one cycle; 94 °C (15 s (sec), 58 °C (30 s), and 68 °C (4 min) for 10 cycles; 94 °C (15 s), 58 °C (30 s), and 68 °C (4 min) for 15 cycles; and 72 °C (7 min) for 1 cycle. The PCR product was precipitated with ethanol and then phosphorylated by T4 kinase. The phosphorylated fragment was self-ligated by T4 DNA ligase and digested with restriction enzyme DpnI to eliminate the non-mutated template. The mutated plasmid was cloned and amplified inEscherichia coli (DH5-α strain) competent cells. For transfections, growing F10.9 cells were seeded in 6-cm Nunc plates. After 24 h, each well received 2 ml of a mixture containing a constant amount of 3.3 μg of DNA composed of 0.5 μg of the Po or MBP promoter-luciferase pGL3 plasmids, 100 ng of pSV40-Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) and completed with empty pCDNA3, alone or with Sox10 or Pax3 expression vectors, plus 20 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), all in medium without antibiotics. After culture for 12 h at 37 °C, each transfected plate was split into 10 wells of 6-well plates, and half the wells were treated with IL6RIL6, and half were left untreated. After further culture for 72 h, the dual luciferase assay system kit (Promega) was used to measure luciferase activities according to the manufacturer's protocol. Results were calculated from quadruplicate wells. Nuclear extracts were prepared from F10.9 cells grown in 9-cm dishes for different times in the presence or absence of IL6RIL6 (300 ng/ml). The cell monolayer, washed with PBS (minus calcium, magnesium), was scraped with a rubber policeman in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline into Eppendorf tubes. Pellets recovered by centrifugation at 3000 rpm were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Pellets were thawed on ice and homogenized in hypotonic Buffer A (4 volumes per volume pellet) by mixing five times with pipette, left 10 min on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 5000 rpm. The pellet compacted by a 10-s spin at 14000 rpm was resuspended in 2.5 volumes (relative to original cell pellet) of Buffer B by mixing five times with pipette, left on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged 14000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (nuclear extracts) were kept at −70 °C. Buffer A contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF and was completed at the last moment with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mix of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem) diluted 1/50 in Buffer A. Buffer B is the same as Buffer A with 400 mm NaCl. Complementary oligonucleotides of Po promoter 176/−151 segment (see Fig. 6 D) were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (104 cpm/fmol) and polynucleotide kinase. After annealing, the double-stranded oligonucleotide was purified on a non-denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel. About 20,000 cpm of the oligonucleotide probe (20 fmol) was incubated with 2 μl of nuclear extracts for 20 min on ice in a final volume of 20 μl. The incubation buffer final composition was 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, with, respectively, 2 and 0.1 μg of poly(dG)-poly(dC) and poly(dI)-poly(dC) alternate copolymers per assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For competition, 2 pmol of cold wild-type −176/−151 probe or oligonucleotides with mutated CACC site were used as follows: 5′-TGTGTCCCTAGATCTACCTACCCAGA-3′ (−168/−161 mutant) or 5′-TGTGTCCCCCGGGCCCCCTACCCAGA-3′ (−165/−163 mutant). The MATCHMAKER one-hybrid system from Clontech was used according to the manufacturer's protocols. Complementary synthetic oligonucleotides containing the CACC box sequence −174/−156 of the myelin Po promoter cTGTCCCCCCACCCCCCTACa were placed in four tandem repeats upstream of the pHis-1 and pLAcZ1 plasmids. Target reporter strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae YM4271 were obtained after transformation with these plasmids and tested for minimal background growth in minimal medium lacking histidine and containing calibrated concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). A cDNA library (minimal length 400 bp) was prepared from RNA extracted from F10.9 melanoma cells that had been treated for 48 h with IL6RIL6. The amplified and tailed cDNAs were used for recombination-mediated cloning in yeast with the SmaI-linearized pGADT7-Rec plasmid to form fusion products with the Gal4 activation domain upon transformation into the target reporter yeast strain. Large positive yeast colonies growing in the minimal synthetic dropout (SD) medium lacking histidine and leucine and supplemented with 30 mm 3-AT were selected. Plasmids isolated from the yeast colonies by cloning into E. coli DH5α were tested individually in the yeast target reporter strain. Screening was done in the histidine- and leucine-free selective medium for colonies that grew as efficiently in the presence of at least 30 mm 3-AT as in the absence of 3-AT, thereby eliminating false-positive clones. Candidate plasmids were isolated and sequenced from 5′ and 3′ ends of the insert. Specific primers were prepared for RT-PCR with RNA from F10.9 cells treated or not with IL6RIL6 (for ZBP-99, forward, 5′-GAGGACACATAGTGGAGAAAAGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTTCTACTGAATAACTATGCATGT-3′). Constructs with full-length open reading frames were made in pcDNA3 expression vector and used for transfections as above. As previously reported (40Kamaraju A.K. Bertolotto C. Chebath J. Revel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15132-15141Google Scholar), treatment of the melanoma F10.9 cells by the gp130 activator IL6RIL6 induces a transition in morphology from epithelial-like cells to elongated cells with extended processes that align to form cell tracks. Concomitantly to the cell shape changes, the IL6RIL6-treated cells stopped releasing melanin pigment in the medium, and the rate-limiting melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase decreased. We have demonstrated (40Kamaraju A.K. Bertolotto C. Chebath J. Revel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15132-15141Google Scholar) that the loss of tyrosinase upon IL6RIL6 treatment results from the decrease in the transcription factor MITF, decrease that is itself mainly because of the loss of Pax3 from the cells. Fig.1 A shows that following the Pax3 RNA down-regulation, there was a strong induction of MBP transcripts in the IL6RIL6-treated melanoma cells. A progressive accumulation of MBP mRNA was observed from 12 to 48 h (Fig.1 B). Transcripts for myelin Po, which is the most abundant component specifically found in the peripheral nerve myelin made by Schwann cells, were strongly induced by IL6RIL6 in the F10.9 cells starting from 24 h (Fig.2 C). The CNPase protein, another constant component of myelin (43Sprinkle T.J. McMorris F.A. Yoshino J. DeVries G.H. Neurochem. Res. 1985; 10: 919-931Google Scholar), was similarly induced by IL6RIL6 in the F10.9 melanoma cells (Fig. 2 D). There was also an induction of PMP-22 and of galactocerebroside (GalC; not shown). The F10.9 melanoma cell response to IL6RIL6 can be defined as a transdifferentiation, because the cells transit from a melanocytic phenotype, which is enhanced if the cells are treated by forskolin (40Kamaraju A.K. Bertolotto C. Chebath J. Revel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15132-15141Google Scholar), to a phenotype characteristic of myelinating Schwann cells.Figure 2Ectopic expression of Pax3 inhibits Po and MBP promoter activities; down-regulation of Pax3 with IL6RIL6 treatment may account for promoter induction.

Tamura T. Aoyama A. Mikoshiba K. Gene. 1989; 75: 31-38Google Scholar) in front of the luciferase reporter gene. This region of the promoter confers tissue-specific expression in cell lines and in myelinating oligodendrocytes in vivo (44Wrabetz L. Taveggia C. Feltri M.L. Quattrini A. Awatrami R. Scherer S.S. Messing A. Kamholz J. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 34: 10-26Google Scholar). Transfection of the F10.9 cells with this reporter gene demonstrated that the MBP gene undergoes a transcriptional activation of about 5-fold in response to the IL6RIL6 stimulus (Fig. 2 A). For the myelin Po gene, the 5′ flanking sequences −912 to +45 of the rat gene, which confer specific expression in Sc"

The regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins RGS4 and RGS16 share conserved cysteine (Cys) residues that undergo palmitoylation. In the accompanying article (Hiol, A., Davey, P.

Chem. 278, 19301–19308), we determined that mutation of NH2-terminal cysteine residues in RGS16 (Cys-2 and Cys-12) reduced GTPase accelerating (GAP) activity toward a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A)/Gαo1 receptor fusion protein in cell membranes. NH2-terminal acylation also permitted palmitoylation of a cysteine residue in the RGS box of RGS16 (Cys-98). Here we investigated the role of internal palmitoylation in RGS16 localization and GAP activity. Mutation of RGS16 Cys-98 or RGS4 Cys-95 to alanine reduced GAP activity on the 5-HT1A/Gαo1 fusion protein and regulation of adenylyl cyclase inhibition. The C98A mutation had no effect on RGS16 localization or GAP activity toward purified G-protein α subunits. Enzymatic palmitoylation of RGS16 resulted in internal palmitoylation on residue Cys-98. Palmitoylated RGS16 or RGS4 WT but not C98A or C95A preincubated with membranes expressing 5-HT1a/Gαo1 displayed increased GAP activity over time. These results suggest that palmitoylation of a Cys residue in the RGS box is critical for RGS16 and RGS4 GAP activity and their ability to regulate Gi-coupled signaling in mammalian cells.

Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors by peptides and hormones catalyzes the exchange of GDP with GTP on the α subunit of its associated heterotrimeric G protein. The active, GTP-bound form of the α subunit interacts with effectors, initiating a signaling cascade. Deactivation of this signaling pathway is mediated by the intrinsic GTPase activity of α subunits, which is in turn accelerated by cognate GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase activating protein; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; pPAT, partially purified protein acyltransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DRMs, detergent-resistant membranes; WT, wild-type; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin); AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; IB, incubation buffer. the regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS proteins) (reviewed in Ref. 1DeVries L.

The RGS protein family is large (more than 30 proteins in mammalian cells), and its members share high sequence homology within the conserved RGS domain that confers GAP activity. Regulation of RGS proteins may determine their cell-to-cell specificity and preference for certain G-protein α subunits or G-protein-coupled receptor-linked signaling pathways.

A short amphipathic α-helical region in the NH2-terminal region of RGS16, conserved in both RGS4 and RGS5, imparts membrane localization (17Chen C. Seow K.T. Guo K. Yaw L.P. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we found that RGS16 was palmitoylated on Cys-2 and Cys-12 at the NH2 terminus (18Druey K.M. Ugur O. Caron J.M. Chen C.K. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mutation of Cys-2 and Cys-12 to alanine, and the resulting loss of palmitoylation on these residues, reduced the inhibition of both Gi- and Gq-coupled signaling normally observed in cells expressing RGS16. In the accompanying article (33Hiol A. Davey P.C. Osterhout J.L. Waheed A.A. Fischer E.R. Chen C.K. Milligan G. Druey K.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 19301-19308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we observed that mutation of Cys-2 and Cys-12 virtually eliminated palmitate incorporation into RGS16, reduced GAP activity toward Gα in a membrane-based assay, and mistargeted RGS16 away from lipid rafts. However, this abnormal localization could not explain the lack of RGS16 function, as disruption of lipid rafts with methyl-β-cyclodextrin increased membrane GTPase activity in the absence of RGS16 while preserving the ability of transfected RGS16 to further increase the agonist-evoked GTPase rate. Instead, we found that NH2-terminal palmitoylation permitted palmitoylation of RGS16 on an internal cysteine residue in the RGS box (Cys-98), possibly by retaining the protein in the lipid rafts, which are enriched in protein acyltransferase activity. Because previous studies have implicated a role for palmitoylation of an internal cysteine residue in the GAP activity of other RGS proteins (19Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we investigated palmitoylation of RGS16 at Cys-98 to determine its importance for membrane localization, protein-protein interactions, and enzymatic activity. We found that mutation of this Cys to alanine reduced RGS16 GAP activity toward the 5-HT1A/Gαo1 fusion protein in membranes but did not substantially alter membrane or lipid raft localization. The analogous mutation in RGS4 resulted in a similar reduction in GAP activity. Most importantly, direct enzymatic palmitoylation of RGS16 or RGS4 by a protein acyltransferase followed by membrane preincubation markedly increased GAP activity over time. The C98A mutation also abrogated the ability of RGS16 or RGS4 to regulate Gi-mediated adenylyl cyclase inhibition, confirming the significance of this internal palmitoylation site for RGS function in mammalian cells. Reagents—Isoproterenol, somatostatin, EDTA, ATP, GTP, AMP-PNP, creatine phosphate, clostripain, and creatine phosphokinase were obtained from Sigma. Superfect transfection reagent was purchased from Qiagen, and pertussis toxin from Calbiochem. Cell Culture, Proteins, and Plasmids—HEK293 and COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 mm glutamine, and antibiotics in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. HEK293 cells stably expressing a fusion protein between the human 5-HT1A receptor and Gαo1 containing a C351G mutation that renders the G-protein resistant to pertussis toxin were generated as previously described (34Kellett E.

After a 2-h blocking step in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.01% Tween 20 + 10% milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibody (CT265, 1:1000) or anti-HA (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics) for an additional 2 h. Blots were then equilibrated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. Signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adenylyl Cyclase and Single Turnover GAP Assays—These assays were performed exactly as described previously (11Derrien A. Druey K.M. J. Biol.

Purification of Protein Acyltransferase—Purification of pPAT was performed as described in detail elsewhere. 2A. Hiol, J. M. Caron, C. D. Smith, and T. L. Z. Jones, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the plasma membrane from rat livers was extracted with 0.15% Triton X-100 and the PAT activity was purified over several chromatography steps, octyl-Sepharose, cerulenin analogue affinity, Q-Sepharose, and palmitoyl CoA-agarose. Enzymatic Palmitoylation of RGS Proteins—Recombinant RGS16 or RGS4 was diluted in incubation buffer (IB) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA) at a protein concentration of 0.4–1 mg/ml and incubated with the pPAT preparation (10 μg of protein), 200 μm CoA, 2 mm ATP, and 1 μl of [9,10-3H]palmitate (5 mCi/ml, 30–60 Ci/mmol, ARC Inc.). The final reaction volume was adjusted to 100 μl with IB. The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer after 45 min at 30 °C. Proteins were subjected to one-dimensional PAGE and stained by MicrowaveBlue (Protiga). Acylation was determined by fluorography using the Wax technique (ISC BioExpress) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Stoichiometry of Palmitoylation—Recombinant RGS16 (260 pmol) incubated with pPAT was diluted into IB buffer that contained 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1% sucrose. The solutions were loaded into an Ultrafree filtration unit (Amicon) previously equilibrated with IB. The samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min and the filters washed once with 400 μl of 70% ethanol, then twice with IB. The insert cups were counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry, and palmitate incorporation was calculated based on observed counts and the specific activity of [3H]palmitate. Stoichiometry of labeling was determined as the ratio of picomole of palmitate to picomole of RGS16 per reaction. Clostripain Cleavage—This procedure was carried out as in the accompanying article (33Hiol A. Davey P.C. Osterhout J.L. Waheed A.A. Fischer E.R. Chen C.K. Milligan G. Druey K.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 19301-19308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar) except that recombinant RGS16 (10 μg) was used as the substrate. Statistical Analysis—Two tailed p values were determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test using Graph Pad Instat software. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Sigma Plot 8.0 software was used for curve fitting. A Cysteine Residue in the RGS Box Is Critical for RGS16 GAP Activity—We tested the role of the conserved RGS box cysteine for the function of RGS16 and because it appeared to be a site of palmitoylation (19Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Hiol A. Davey P.C. Osterhout J.L. Waheed A.A. Fischer E.R.

We transfected a cell line stably expressing a 5-HT1A/Gαo1 (C351G) fusion protein with HA-RGS16 WT or RGS16 (C98A) plasmids. Cells were treated with pertussis toxin to block receptor coupling to endogenous Gαi/o proteins, and membranes were prepared. Both basal and agonist-induced GTPase activity in membranes incubated with a range of 5-HT concentration were increased in the presence of WT RGS16 or compared with membranes transfected with a vector control plasmid (LacZ) as expected (37Welsby P.J. Kellet E. Wilkinson G. Milligan G. Mol. Pharm. 2002; 61: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, GTPase activity in membranes expressing RGS16 (C98A) was decreased nearly 50% in comparison to membranes expressing WT RGS16 (FIG. 1A, upper panel). Addition of maximal 5-HT doses (10-6 to 10-4m) resulted in a ∼3.5-fold increase in activity in membranes containing WT RGS16 while the same dose resulted in only a 2.3-fold increase in activity in membranes containing RGS16 (C98A). Mutation of Cys-95 in RGS4 to alanine resulted in a similar reduction in GAP activity in this assay (FIG. 1A, lower panel). Decreased RGS16 or RGS4 levels in the membranes could not explain the loss of function of the cysteine mutants, because the amount of immunodetectable proteins was comparable (Fig. 1B). A previous study showed that the GAP activity of RGS4 was unaffected by mutation of Cys-95 to Val in a single turnover assay (19Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the reduction in transfected RGS16 (C98A) activity could be a result of mutation of cysteine to alanine independent of palmitoylation, we purified WT or C98A recombinant RGS16 from E. coli, which would not undergo posttranslational modification, and measured agonist-stimulated GTPase activity of the fusion protein in membranes in the presence of purified RGS16. Addition of WT RGS16 or C98A to membranes from cells expressing the 5-HT1A/Gαo1 protein enhanced GTPase activity equally in response to 5-HT even at subsaturating concentrations (Fig. 1C). In addition, we found no significant difference in the abilities of RGS16 WT or C98A to promote GTP hydrolysis by purified Gαi in a single turnover assay (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the loss of a cysteine thiol group was not by itself responsible for the decreased activity of RGS16 (C98A) expressed in mammalian cell membranes. Cysteine 98 Is Essential for RGS16 and RGS4 Inhibition of Gi-regulated Adenylyl Cyclase Activity—We tested the ability of the cysteine mutants to regulate Gi signaling in HEK293 cells. Somatostatin decreases adenylyl cyclase activity through Gαi activation. Because decreases in basal levels of adenylyl cyclase activity are difficult to detect, we treated the cells concurrently with isoproterenol, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase through endogenous β-adrenergic receptors coupled to Gαs. Consistent with previous studies (18Druey K.M. Ugur O. Caron J.M. Chen C.K. Backlund P.S. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), expression of WT RGS16 or WT RGS4 inhibited the negative regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity induced by somatostatin compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, expression of RGS16 (C98A), RGS16 (C2A/C12A), or the analogous RGS4 mutants did not alter adenylyl cyclase activity compared with control cells. These results demonstrate that neither mutant was able to regulate Gi-coupled adenylyl cyclase inhibition effectively in HEK293 cells. Cysteine 98 Is Not Required for RGS16 Plasma Membrane or Lipid Raft Localization—We delineated the membrane localization of RGS16 (C98A) by cellular fractionation and immunoblotting as previously described (33Hiol A. Davey P.C. Osterhout J.L. Waheed A.A. Fischer E.R. Chen C.K. Milligan G. Druey K.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 19301-19308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to determine whether redistribution of the protein in membranes could account for its lack of function. The amounts of RGS16 WT or C98A found in the total membrane fraction (T) as well as the plasma membrane fraction (P) were comparable (Fig. 3A). The integrity of the fractions was verified by enrichment of the marker Na+/K+-ATPase in the plasma membrane fraction. We then assessed the distribution of RGS16 (C98A) within the membrane fraction by OptiPrep gradient centrifugation. We found RGS16 (C98A) in fraction 1, which contains DRMs, indicated by caveolin and Gαi immunoreactivity (Fig. 3B). Because the distribution of the C98A mutant was similar to WT RGS16 (33Hiol A. Davey P.C. Osterhout J.L. Waheed A.A. Fischer E.R. Chen C.K. Milligan G. Druey K.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 19301-19308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar), this result suggests that the C98A mutation did not substantially alter the distribution of RGS16 in the plasma membrane or its localization to lipid rafts. Enzymatic Palmitoylation of RGS16—The aforementioned results suggest that the poor function of RGS16 (C98A) was not because of the cysteine to alanine mutation itself or a decrease in RGS16 found at the membrane. Therefore, we investigated whether palmitoylation on the RGS box cysteine could affect function of RGS16 in vitro. In the accompanying article (33Hiol A. Davey P.C. Osterhout J.L. Waheed A.A. Fischer E.R. Chen C.K. Milligan G. Druey K.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 19301-19308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we metabolically labeled cells expressing RGS16 WT or C98A with [3H]palmitate and immunoprecipitated RGS16. We then treated immunoprecipitates with the protease clostripain, which was expected to yield a 5-kDa fragment containing Cys-98. Consistent with this prediction, we observed palmitate incorporation in a 5-kDa band only in immunoprecipitates of RGS16 WT but not C98A. To assess whether this residue underwent enzymatic palmitoylation directly, we chemically acylated recombinant RGS16 with partially purified PAT from rat liver membranes. Incubation of RGS16 WT or C98A with pPAT and [3H]palmitoyl-CoA led to incorporation of tritium in a band with a molecular mass consistent with RGS16 (∼30 kDa, Fig. 4A, left panel), confirming that the NH2-terminal cysteines were the major sites of palmitoylation. RGS4 demonstrated a similar pattern of palmitoylation after incubation with the pPAT preparation (FIG. 4A, right panel). After clostripain cleavage of WT RGS16, we observed [3H]palmitate incorporation in a 5-kDa band only in samples containing RGS16 WT but not C98A. Coomassie Blue staining revealed an identical pattern of cleavage of RGS16 WT, C2A/C12A, and C98A, indicating that the 5-kDa band was present in the digest of C98A but was not palmitoylated (Fig. 4B). The stoichiometry of palmitate incorporation was ∼2.6 ± 0.1 mol of palmitate to 1 mol of RGS16 (WT), which correlates well with the 3 predicted palmitoylation sites (mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments). Moreover, each mutant demonstrated incorporation of [3H]palmitate congruent with the number of target cysteine residues present (0.7 ± 0.1 mol of palmitate/mol of RGS16 C2A/C12A; 1.5 ± 0.03 mol of palmitate/mol of RGS16 (C98A)). These results suggest that Cys-98 is a direct site of palmitoylation. Effect of Enzymatic Palmitoylation on RGS16 GAP Activity—We first assessed GAP activity of RGS16 preincubated with pPAT in a solution assay measuring single turnover GTP hydrolysis by purified Gαo. We treated RGS16 or RGS4 with pPAT or boiled pPAT and found that boiling the enzyme dramatically reduced the amount of RGS16 palmitoylation, suggesting that the process was predominantly enzymatic (data not shown). We observed no significant difference in GAP activity toward Gαo (RGS16) or Gαi (RGS4) between RGS proteins treated with pPAT and untreated proteins (Fig. 5A) or RGS proteins preincubated with boiled pPAT in the single turnover assay (data not shown). We next measured high affinity GTPase activity of the 5-HT1A/Gαo1 fusion protein in membranes incubated with recombinant RGS16 treated with pPAT. When assessed with a single time point (representing a 20-min incubation with 10-6m 5-HT), there was little difference in GAP activity between RGS16 and pPAT-treated RGS16 (data not shown). However, because recent studies suggest that RGS proteins may bind to membranes in a time-dependent fashion and that this process may be affected by palmitoylation (22Tu Y. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we preincubated membranes with recombinant RGS16 or RGS4 for various times before agonist stimulation to determine whether palmitoylation affected RGS membrane binding and GAP activity. The GAP activity of RGS16 or RGS4 that had been treated with pPAT and palmitate increased significantly with longer membrane preincubation times (Fig. 5, B–C). In contrast, membranes incubated with either the pPAT preparation alone or untreated RGS proteins failed to exhibit any significant time-dependent increase in GTPase activity. Although the GAP activity of untreated RGS16 did not increase over time (Fig. 5B), RGS16-containing membranes displayed significantly higher absolute GTPase activity compared with membranes incubated with pPAT alone (2.05 ± 0.21-fold). In contrast, activity of membranes containing pPAT was equivalent to buffer-treated membranes (0.98 ± 0.19-fold), indicating that the pPAT preparation lacked intrinsic GTPase or GAP activity. These results suggest that palmitoylation of RGS16 and RGS4 augments GAP activity toward a membrane-bound Gα subunit and that this enhancement is facilitated by RGS-membrane interaction over time. To confirm the sites of RGS16 palmitoylation and their relative roles in GAP activity, we first measured incorporation of [3H]palmitate into pPAT-treated, recombinant RGS16 WT or C2A/C12A and C98A mutants with or without cleavage with clostripain (Fig. 5C, right panel). Levels of tritium incorporation into full-length RGS16 (30 kDa) were compatible with the number of palmitoylated residues. No palmitoylation of the ∼5-kDa band containing Cys-98 was observed with the C98A mutant after clostripain treatment, whereas the palmitoylated fragment containing Cys-98 was clearly visualized with the C2A/C12A mutant. Palmitoylation of Cys-98 in the C2A/C12A mutant was expected in this assay because recombinant RGS16 was incubated with pPAT in vitro. To determine which site of palmitoylation was responsible for increased RGS16 GAP activity induced by membrane interaction, we treated recombinant RGS16 WT, C2A/C12A, and C98A with pPAT and then preincubated proteins with 5-HT1A/Gαo1 me"
https://openalex.org/W2170651899,"Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) have been implicated in a multitude of proliferative functions, and FGFR4 is expressed differentially in normal and neoplastic pituitary. Human pituitary tumors express a truncated FGFR4 isoform (ptd-FGFR4) for which transcription is initiated from a downstream alternative site. Analysis of FGFR4 intronic sequences predicted a possible promoter within intron 4 (In4) including a classic TATA box with a possible transcriptional start site in intron 5. We show here that the human In4 sequence can direct luciferase reporter activity in transfected pituitary GH4 cells. Four overlapping fragments (A1, A2, B1, and B2) of this intron were examined by electromobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from rat pituitary tumors. Of these, fragment B2 formed complexes with nuclear rat pituitary GH4 extracts that were competed specifically by wild type but not mutant oligonucleotides for the neural crest cell lineage-derived activating transcription factor AP-2. Conversely, an AP-2 consensus sequence probe was competed by the In4 B2 oligonucleotide but not by other fragments of the same intron. The In4 B2 complex was competed partially by NFκB, supershifted by an AP-2α-specific antibody, and co-migrated with the same probe incubated with recombinant AP-2α protein. We also examined the ability of primary human pituitary tumor extracts to interact with the In4 B2 fragment. Pituitary tumor-In4 B2 complexes were competed specifically by wild type AP-2 but not mutant AP-2 oligonucleotides. Western blotting revealed higher levels of AP-2α expression in primary human pituitary tumors than in nontumorous tissue. Mutagenesis of the putative AP-2 binding site in In4 B2 resulted in a marked loss of promoter activity in a luciferase assay. AP-2α transfection in the presence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin-A resulted in enhanced expression of endogenous ptd-FGFR4. These data indicate that a cryptic promoter within intron 4 binds AP-2α. AP-2α and chromatin changes may contribute to the utilization of an alternative transcription start site leading to the genesis of the tumorigenic ptd-FGFR4 isoform.

The pituitary gland is the site of synthesis and the target of several growth factors that modulate hormone production and cell proliferation (1Asa S.L. Ezzat S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 836-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Of these, members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; ptd-FGFR4, human pituitary tumor-derived FGFR4; In4, intron 4; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; B2ex, extended B2 fragment; Ik, Ikaros; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Luc, luciferase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription. family have been shown to be overexpressed in human pituitary tumors (2Ezzat S. Smyth H.S. Ramyar L. Asa S.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 878-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF signaling is mediated through one of four FGF receptors (FGFRs), a complex family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (3Givol D. Yayon A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3362-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Each prototypic receptor is composed of three Ig-like extracellular domains, a single transmembrane domain, a split tyrosine kinase, and a carboxyl-terminal tail with multiple autophosphorylation sites (3Givol D. Yayon A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3362-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Multiple cell-bound or secreted forms of FGFR1, -2, and -3 have been characterized as resulting from alternative initiation sites, alternative splicing, exon switching, or variable polyadenylation. Recently, we found that pituitary tumors express a cytoplasmic form of FGFR4 lacking the signal peptide and the first two extracellular Ig-like domains (4Ezzat S. Zheng L. Zhu X.F. Wu G.E. Asa S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Full-length FGFR4 has been reported to be expressed mainly in adult lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, muscle, and spleen (5Partanen J. Mäkelä T.P. Eerola E. Korhonen J. Hirvonen H. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Hughes S.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1005-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It initially was considered not to have a significant role in tumorigenesis. However, FGFR4 has been shown to mediate membrane ruffling in breast carcinoma cells (7Johnston C.L. Cox H.C. Gomm J.J. Coombes R.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and to modulate erythroid cell proliferation (8Koritschoner N.P. Bartunek P. Knespel S. Blendinger G. Zenke M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5904-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutational analyses of the kinase domains of FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4 revealed that all three receptor domains have comparable transforming properties (9Hart K.C. Robertson S.C. Kanemitsu M.Y. Meyer A.N. Tynan J.A. Donoghue J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 29: 3309-3320Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We have shown that targeted expression of a human pituitary tumor-derived FGFR4 isoform (ptd-FGFR4) recapitulates pituitary tumorigenesis (4Ezzat S. Zheng L. Zhu X.F. Wu G.E. Asa S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This truncated form of FGFR4 is a result of transcription initiation in intron 5 and a translation start site in exon 6 (4Ezzat S. Zheng L. Zhu X.F. Wu G.E. Asa S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigate an alternative FGFR4 promoter that may be implicated in the genesis of ptd-FGFR4. Sequence analysis of the human FGFR4 gene predicts a possible promoter within intron 4 including a classic TATA box with a possible transcription start site in intron 5 (4Ezzat S. Zheng L. Zhu X.F. Wu G.E. Asa S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Becker M. Brauninger A. Wolf G. Kaufmann M. Strebhardt K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We thus focused on intron 4 and the surrounding region and determined the relevant cis-DNA-binding elements in pituitary cells that may contribute to utilization of this site. Cell Culture and Tissue—HEK 293 and the rat pituitary tumor-derived GH4 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 24 h before transfection, cells were plated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum. Primary human pituitary tumors were collected at the time of trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery and snap frozen. Plasmids—Promoter analysis of the human FGFR4 gene was performed with the assistance of a gene finder. The convention for sequence coordinates with +1 as the first base of the coding sequence in exon 1 was adopted. Analysis of FGFR4 intronic sequences predicted a possible promoter within intron 4 (nucleotides 5056–5166) and a classic TATA box (nucleotides 5412–5417) with a possible transcription start site in intron 5 (nucleotide 5453). To generate the putative intron 4 (In4)-inclusive promoter, a KpnI/XhoI fragment of 313 bp consisting of intron 4 and exon 5 was derived by PCR from PAC# 32C5 (11Kostrzewa M. Muller U. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The upstream primer was 5′-GGACCTCTCGAATAGGCACA-3′ (nucleotides 5021–5040), and the downstream primer was 5′-GGCTTACGGAGGTTACGCCA-3′ (nucleotides 5333–5314). After cloning into TA vector (Invitrogen), products were subcloned into their corresponding sites of the promoterless firefly luciferase expression vector pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield the P313-Luc plasmid. The orientation and sequence of all constructs were verified by restriction analysis and nucleotide sequencing, respectively. The expression vector pcDNA-AP-2α encoding the complete sequence for AP-2α cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) KpnI/XhoI sites was used as described previously (12McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutations of the AP-2 transcription core binding site (-CCCTCCAGC-) substituted by -CTTTCCAGC- and the NFκB binding site (-GGGGCCTTCC-) substituted by -GGCGCCTTGC- were introduced separately into the P313-Luc construct and In4 B2 fragment using mutagenic primers for the sites. Another primer containing the mutation of a unique restriction site was used as a selection marker. Mutations were confirmed by restriction digestion and nucleotide sequencing. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—All plasmid reporters and expression vectors were prepared by column chromatography (QiaGen, Missisauga, Ontario) for sequencing and transfections. Cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated into six-well cluster dishes (7 × 104 cells/well) and were transfected the following day with 3 or 5 μl/well LipofectAMINE and 1 or 2 μg of DNA/well as indicated. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding empty vector. Transfection efficiency was monitored by simultaneous cotransfection with a β-galactosidase reporter construct (20 ng/well). Histone deacetylase inhibition was performed using trichostatin-A (Sigma) at 100 ng/ml for 24 h. 48 h following transfection, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Luciferase activity was measured for 20 s in a luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was measured to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency. Promoter activity of each construct was expressed as firefly luciferase/β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was performed independently on three separate occasions with at least triplicate wells in each experiment. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared by washing cells in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysing in 100 μl of buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 5 min on ice. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of the nuclear resuspension buffer (0.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed with three cycles of freezing and thawing to 37 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the clear supernatant was collected and kept at -80 °C for further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase. Five μg of nuclear protein extracts and 2 ng of labeled oligonucleotides were allowed to bind for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences, Peapack, NJ). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. Overlapping double-stranded oligonucleotide fragments of intron 4 of FGFR4 (nucleotides 5056–5166) were used as probes and for competition in EMSAs as shown in Fig. 1 and detailed as follows: fragment A1 (nucleotides 5056–5085), 5′-GTCAGTAGGTCTCCAAGGACTTGTGTCCCG-3′; fragment A2 (nucleotides 5077–5115), 5′-TGTGTCCCGCTGCTGCTCATCTGATCACTGAGAAGAGGA-3′; fragment B1 (nucleotides 5106–5136), 5′-GAGAAGAGGAGGCCTGTGTGGGAACACACGG-3′; and fragment B2 (nucleotides 5127–5166), 5′-GAACACACGGTCATTCTAGGGGCCTTCCCCTGCCCTCCAG-3′. In some experiments, the B2 fragment was further extended (B2ex) to include the first six nucleotides of exon 5, thereby including the entire AP-2 consensus binding site, 5′-GAACACACGGTCATTCTAGGGGCCTTCCCCTGCCCTCCAGCACCCT-3′ (Fig. 1). Competitor double-stranded oligonucleotides containing transcription binding sites were as follows: AP-2, sense 5′-CCACAAACGACCGCCCGCGGGCGGT-3′ (commercially obtained from Geneka Biotech Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and its complementary strand; the mutant oligonucleotide for mAP-2, sense 5′-CCACAAACGACCGATTGCGGGCGGT-3′ and its complementary strand; AP-1, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ and its complementary strand; AP-2α, 5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′ and its complementary strand; AP-4, sense 5′-TTACTCCCAGCTCCAGCCGG-3′ and its complementary strand; and NFκB, sense 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ and its complementary strand (synthesized by Sigma). Complementary strands were annealed in a buffer of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA before being used as probes or competitors. Gel shift probes were purified with a Sephadex G-50 spin column after labeling. For competition assay, 10, 20, 50, or 100 m excess of unlabeled fragment was added as competitor DNA. Samples were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide non-denatured gels containing 0.5% Tris borate buffer and 2% glycerol. Gels were dried under a vacuum and autoradiographed. Western Blot Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) from whole cell lysates or nuclear fractions were solubilized in 2× SDS-sample buffer, separated on SDS-8% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with polyclonal antisera raised against the carboxyl terminus of AP-2α (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or FGFR4 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a monoclonal antibody against actin (1:500). The specificity of the detected bands was confirmed by preabsorption of antisera with purified peptide. Sequence analysis of the upstream fragments in intron 4 revealed putative binding sites for the transcription factors AP-2, Ikaros (Ik), NFκB, AP-4, and OCT-1 as depicted in Fig. 1. Intron 4 of FGFR4 Contains Binding Sites for AP-2α—To determine which factors potentially may interact with this putative intronic region, we screened potential candidates using EMSA. EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts from exponentially growing rat pituitary tumor GH4 cells or from primary human pituitary tumors as described previously (13Yu S. Asa S.L. Ezzat S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The overlapping fragments consisted of 30–40 bp of intron 4 that were designated as A1, A2, B1, and B2. These fragments were labeled and used as probes for the assessment of specific binding. Fig. 2A depicts an example of an EMSA using GH4 rat pituitary tumor nuclear extract incubated with the In4 A1 probe. We found no evidence of specific complexes that could be competed by putative transcription factors using this In4 A1 fragment. Similar nonspecific findings were obtained with the In4 A2 and In4 B1 fragments. In contrast, incubation of the same nuclear extracts with the In4 B2 fragment yielded distinct complexes that were competed specifically by wild type but not mutant AP-2 oligonucleotides (Fig. 2B). This complex was not competed by oligonucleotides for predicted binding sites for AP-4, OCT-1, Ik, or STAT but was competed partially with an oligonucleotide for NFκB. The putative AP-2 binding site is situated on the intron-exon junction (Fig. 1). Extension of the probe by 6 nucleotides into exon 5 (In4 B2ex) to complete the AP-2 consensus binding site resulted in a more distinct complex that was supershifted by AP-2α antibody (Fig. 2C). To determine further the specificity of the putative intron 4 interaction with AP-2, we examined the ability of an AP-2 consensus probe to form complexes with GH4 nuclear extracts. This complex was competed specifically by the In4 B2 fragment but not by other fragments from the same intron (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the In4 B2 probe formed specific complexes with the recombinant GST-AP-2α fusion protein (Fig. 2D). Mutation of the putative AP-2 binding site in the B2 fragment resulted in a complex that was not competed by wild type AP-2 (Fig. 2E), consistent with the presence of a single AP-2 binding site in this fragment of intron 4. This complex, however, was competed partially by NFκB (Fig. 2E). Consistent with these findings, an NFκB probe also formed complexes with GH4 nuclear extracts that were competed specifically by In4 B2 but not by the adjacent In4 A2 sequence (Fig. 2F). These results indicate that the region of the cryptic promoter contained within In4 B2 contains adjacent consensus binding sites for AP-2 and NFκB. Furthermore, GH4 cells express nuclear factors that bind to these sites, and this multiprotein-DNA complex is supershifted with antibody to AP-2α, thus confirming that AP-2α is one factor that targets the region encompassing In4 B2. Primary Human Pituitary Tumors Express AP-2α—Given our previous findings of a human pituitary tumor-derived FGFR4 isoform, we sought evidence for a potential role of the AP-2 binding site in intron 4 in primary human pituitary tumors. Nuclear proteins from primary human pituitary tumors formed the same slow migrating complexes with the In4 B2 probe (Fig. 3A). These complexes were competed specifically by an oligonucleotide for wild type AP-2 but not by mutant AP-2. To confirm that primary human pituitary tumors express the AP-2α protein, we examined by Western blotting extracts from primary human pituitary adenomas characterized as expressing the truncated ptd-FGFR4 (4Ezzat S. Zheng L. Zhu X.F. Wu G.E. Asa S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We identified a protein of ∼50 kDa using an AP-2α-specific antibody in nontumorous pituitary tissue and in pituitary adenomas (Fig. 3B). This product comigrated with protein derived from HEK 293 cells transfected with an expression vector for AP-2α. When adjusted for actin levels, AP-2α protein was more abundant in the pituitary tumors than in nontumorous pituitary tissue. Functional Contribution of AP-2 in Regulation of FGFR4 — To determine the potential functional contribution of the AP-2 binding site in intron 4 (P313-Luc) on promoter activity, we examined the effect of mutation of this site on promoter activity. Disruption of the AP-2 site in the B2 fragment resulted in marked reduction in luciferase activity (Fig. 4). In addition, mutation of the NFκB site also resulted in a loss of reporter activity but to a lesser extent than that noted with the loss of the core AP-2 binding site. Conversely, inclusion of exon 5 and intron 5 did not enhance promoter activity (data not shown). Transfection of AP-2α in GH4 cells treated with trichostatin-A resulted in enhanced expression of ptd-FGFR4 (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results suggest that AP-2α in pituitary tumors, coupled with chromatin changes such as HDAC inhibition, result in enhanced utilization of a cryptic promoter within intron 4, contributing to the genesis of the truncated receptor ptd-FGFR4. Recognizing the importance of a tumor-derived form of FGFR4 in which transcription is initiated from an alternative downstream site (4Ezzat S. Zheng L. Zhu X.F. Wu G.E. Asa S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we set out to examine functionally important cis-DNA elements that can be implicated in the control of a downstream cryptic promoter. Two earlier reports identified the human and murine FGFR4 promoter regions and their transcription start sites (10Becker M. Brauninger A. Wolf G. Kaufmann M. Strebhardt K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Kostrzewa M. Muller U. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Neither study, however, addressed characterization of putative transcription factor binding or transcriptional activity. Our analysis of the 5′ FGFR4 promoter revealed a region 115 bp upstream of the start site that we found to be essential for reporter activity in pituitary cells (13Yu S. Asa S.L. Ezzat S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Overlapping 40–50-bp fragments of this minimal functional promoter were examined by EMSAs. Specific DNA-protein complexes were noted with fragments that contained multiple binding sites for Sp1. This was consistent with the role of Sp1 in the regulation of other FGFR promoters lacking TATA and CAAT sequence motifs including FGFR1 (14Saito H. Kouhara H. Kasayama S. Kishimoto T. Sato B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), FGFR2, and FGFR3 (15Avivi A. Skorecki K. Yayon A. Givol D. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1957-1962PubMed Google Scholar). For each of these FGFRs, ∼100 bp of sequence 5′ to the transcription initiation site appear to confer transcriptional activity to the promoters (16McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5349-5357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We further characterized fragment C (–65 to –25) of FGFR4, as it demonstrated consistently strong binding with nuclear extracts from rat pituitary cells. This fragment contains predicted sites for binding the zinc finger-containing protein Ik, flanked by two sites for Sp1 and Ets-type factors (13Yu S. Asa S.L. Ezzat S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These studies led to the localization of Ik in the pituitary and to identifying it as an important contributor to cell-specific FGFR4 transcriptional regulation. The current studies point to AP-2α as an important factor that recognizes a downstream cryptic promoter in intron 4 of FGFR4. The AP family of transcription factors consists of four different members known as AP-2α, AP-2β, AP-2γ, and AP-2δ (12McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Zhao F. Satoda M. Licht J.D. Hayashizaki Y. Gelb B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40755-40760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal half of these proteins contains a basic domain and a highly conserved helix-span-helix motif that mediates DNA binding and dimerization. In particular, it has been suggested that AP-2α is important in regulating cell proliferation through control of a number of genes responsible for terminal differentiation as well as apoptosis (17Zhao F. Satoda M. Licht J.D. Hayashizaki Y. Gelb B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40755-40760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Pfisterer P. Ehlermann J. Hegen M. Schorle H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45028-45033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our current findings also point to an accompanying role for NFκB in binding and regulating intron 4. In the pituitary, NFκB has been implicated in mediating a number of hormonal signals, including responsiveness to inhibition by dopamine in prolactin-producing pituitary cells (20Fiorentini C. Guerra N. Facchetti M. Finardi A. Tiberio L. Schiaffonati L. Spano P. Missale C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 353-366PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, regulation of the cholecystokinin (21Katsel P.L. Greenstein R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and serum amyloid A1 (22Ren Y. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17770-17778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) gene promoters also involves partially overlapping consensus sites for AP-2 and NFκB. These studies demonstrated a complex functional interaction between these two transcription factors. Our promoter analysis similarly indicates that both NFκB and AP-2α are involved coordinately in the regulation of this cryptic promoter. The close proximity of these two sites further suggests a potential interaction between these two distinct factors to regulate coordinately FGFR4 gene expression. Several pituitary hormone genes, including proopiomelanocortin (23Bishop J.F. Rinaudo M.S. Ritter J.K. Chang A.C. Conant K. Gehlert D.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), prolactin (24Iverson R.A. Day K.H. d'Emden M. Day R.N. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1564-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (25Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Geng Y. Gamboa-Pinto A. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14519-14525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and somatostatin receptors (26Hauser F. Meyerhof W. Wulfsen I. Schonrock C. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), have been described as containing AP-2 binding sites. The presumed functional role of AP-2 in transcriptional regulation of many of these putative target genes, however, remains to be determined. The presence of AP-2 binding sites in intronic sequences has been identified only rarely. DNase I footprinting experiments using intron 1 of the peripherin gene revealed at least two protected regions (In 1 A and In 1 B). In 1 A encompasses an AP-2-like binding site that interacts with both neuroblast and fibroblast nuclear proteins as well as with recombinant AP-2α protein. Gel shift experiments, however, suggested that the interacting nuclear factors are distinct from AP-2α but nonetheless probably belong to the AP-2 family (27Lecomte M.J. Basseville M. Fauquet M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1806-1815PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the laminin receptor precursor promoter similarly revealed that the first intron contains enhancer activity. This region was shown to include a functional AP-2 cis-acting element that is repressed by p53 (28Modugno M. Tagliabue E. Ardini E. Berno V. Galmozzi E. De Bortoli M. Castronovo V. Menard S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7478-7487Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our current findings provide evidence for AP-2α as a distinct factor that is expressed in pituitary tumors, is able to recognize the distal region of an intronic sequence, and is a participant in the regulation of a cryptic FGFR4 promoter. The mechanisms of FGFR action in endocrine cell development and tumorigenesis remain to be elucidated (1Asa S.L. Ezzat S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 836-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our previous identification of a novel human pituitary tumor-derived truncated FGFR4 isoform with distinct properties from wild type FGFR4 (4Ezzat S. Zheng L. Zhu X.F. Wu G.E. Asa S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) has provided a unique opportunity to examine the effects of alternative transcription initiation on FGFR4 function. Our current findings on the recognition of an intronic sequence of FGFR4 by AP-2α and the strong expression of this factor by pituitary tumors begin to address the mechanisms that may favor alternative promoter utilization in transformed cells."

Thus, a certain class of abnormal membrane proteins must be degraded rapidly. Despite the importance of membrane protein degradation, our knowledge about these processes is limited because of difficulty arising from the membrane localization of both substrates and enzymes. For instance, a question of how a peptide bond that is embedded within the lipid bilayer can receive efficient hydrolysis must be answered.Among the ATP-dependent proteases, ClpPX, ClpAX, HslUV, Lon, and FtsH, of Escherichia coli, FtsH is unique in that it is membrane-integrated and that its substrates include integral membrane proteins (1Akiyama Y. Ito K. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 1502-1504Google Scholar, 2Gottesman S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The membrane localization of FtsH is crucial for its ability to degrade membrane proteins (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3888-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the proteolytic activity of FtsH is stimulated by the proton motive force (PMF)1 across the membrane (4Akiyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8066-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Three membrane proteins have been identified as native substrates of this enzyme. Two of them, the SecY subunit of protein translocase (5Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 6Akiyama Y.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), are degraded rapidly in unassembled states. YccA, a multispanning membrane protein of unknown function, may be constitutively degraded, although it is not known whether this protein forms any complex (8Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, FtsH is known to degrade several soluble proteins (1Akiyama Y. Ito K. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 1502-1504Google Scholar, 2Gottesman S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).FtsH contains two transmembrane segments located N-terminally and a large cytoplasmic domain, which consists of two subdomains, an AAA ATPase domain and a protease domain with a zinc metalloprotease motif (HEXXH) (9Tomoyasu T. Yamanaka K. Murata K. Suzaki T. Bouloc P. Kato A. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). FtsH forms a homo-oligomer, and this feature is essential for the ATPase and the protease activities (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3888-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol.

FtsH is also known to interact with a pair of membrane proteins, HflK and HflC, that forms a complex (HflKC) (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HflKC may have a regulatory role in the proteolytic functions of FtsH (8Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Mori H. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22326-22333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In vivo, FtsH exists exclusively as a large complex (estimated molecular mass of more than 1000 kDa) with HflKC in the cytoplasmic membrane. 2N. Saikawa, Y. Akiyama, and K. Ito, submitted for publication. 2N. Saikawa, Y. Akiyama, and K. Ito, submitted for publication.We proposed that FtsH exerts proteolysis against the entire molecule of a membrane-integrated substrate by dislocating it to the cytosolic side of the membrane (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3888-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This was based on our in vivoanalyses using model membrane proteins. A YccA derivative, YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc, was one of them. It was a chimeric protein having a PhoA (alkaline phosphatase mature part) sequence inserted within the third periplasmic region of this protein, which also contains C-terminally attached His6 and Myc tags. The folding state of the PhoA domain can be manipulated as its tight folding depends on the formation of the intramolecular disulfide bonds. Degradation of this fusion protein by FtsH only occurred when it had an intact N-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Although the degradation went to completion when the PhoA moiety was unfolded, it stopped before the PhoA domain when it was folded, leaving a degradation product (I60) that contained the PhoA and its C-terminal regions up to the His6-Myc tag. These degradation processes were dependent on FtsH and took place only as continuation of proteolysis initiated at the N-terminal region of the substrate. Thus, the reaction must have been processive, which is aborted before a tightly folded domain, a probable obstacle for the dislocation process.It was shown further that the degradation initiation requires cytoplasmic exposure of some 20 amino acids or longer N-terminal tail (15Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Mori H. Matsuo E. Ito K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). FtsH is also able to recognize a C-terminal tail for initiation of membrane protein degradation (16Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4775-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For our further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of polypeptide extraction from the membrane and presentation to the proteolytic active site, it is essential to develop an in vitro system, in which membrane protein degradation by FtsH can be studied using membrane-integrated enzyme and substrates.Here we report on the use of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG3350) to induce fusion of vesicles bearing the enzyme and a substrate, and thereby to reproduce subsequent degradation of the substrate upon addition of ATP. We were thus able to reconstitute ATP-dependent proteolysis of lipid bilayer-integrated substrates using purified components. Our results indicate that the dislocation-accompanied proteolytic event can occur without involving other cellular factors such as the Sec translocation channel.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we succeeded in reproducing the FtsH-catalyzed membrane protein degradation in vitro, using the enzyme and substrates, both of which were integrated into the lipid bilayer of either IMVs or reconstituted proteoliposomes. Recently, much attention has been directed to the importance of proteolytic reactions that occur in the vicinity of a membrane. Such reactions not only serve as a quality control device to eliminate unwanted membrane proteins but also as a regulatory mechanism, in which a membrane protein is cleaved to liberate and activate a regulatory domain (30Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, biochemical and molecular characterization has only insufficiently been conducted for membrane-integrated proteases. Although their enzymatic reactions in solution can be studied in vitro in the presence of a detergent and such reactions will provide some important information on the reaction parameters of the protease, many pertinent questions can only be answered by examination of reactions in which both the enzyme and substrates are engaged in their membrane-integrated states.We have shown here that PEG3350 treatment is a simple and effective method to induce fusion of membrane vesicles, and thereby to initiate interaction between a membrane-bound enzyme and a membrane-bound substrate. The size measurement results indicated that the PEG3350 treatment induces fusion of an average of ∼50 vesicles. As this method proved effective for both native IMVs and artificial proteoliposomes, it can probably be used for membrane vesicles of diverse biological sources. However, for in vitro analysis to be possible, membrane vesicles should be in such an orientation, in which enzymatic active site of the protease faces the external milieu, whose composition can easily be manipulated. The substrate should also assume the compatible orientation in the membrane vesicles. Fortunately, in our present case, the availability of inverted membrane vesicles and the asymmetric reconstitution of both FtsH and YccA allowed the strategy described above.The mode of YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc degradation in the fused IMVs was very similar to that observed in vivo, including the degradation arrest in front of the folded PhoA domain. Unfolding of the PhoA domain allowed the degradation to continue beyond the PhoA moiety over the entire molecule. Furthermore, FtsH degraded YccA in reconstituted proteoliposomes without leaving a distinct degradation product. Because the YccA11 mutant protein with the shortened N-terminal tail did not receive degradation in the reconstituted liposomes, the proteolysis in this reconstituted system could only be initiated at the N-terminal region of the fusion protein. Thus, if degradation cannot continue beyond a transmembrane region, an end product lacking only the N-terminal tail should have been detected for the YccA-HA-His6-Myc protein. The lack of such product, together with the fact that this system consisted of purified components, strongly suggests that FtsH can continue degradation of YccA-HA-His6-Myc beyond the first transmembrane segment into the periplasmic and the following transmembrane regions. These results provide strong evidence for the dislocation mechanism of the FtsH-catalyzed membrane protein degradation.Our results showed that the folded PhoA moiety of YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc could at least partially be unfolded by treatment with a high concentration (250 mm) of DTT that should have reduced the intramolecular disulfide bonds in PhoA. Although the wild-type PhoA protein exhibits significant resistance to a reducing agent (31Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8146-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the PhoA portion of the YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc fusion protein may be distorted to some extent (14Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and more susceptible to reduction, making the post-translational unfolding possible. In contrast to our previousin vivo experiments, in which the formation of the intramolecular disulfide bonds in PhoA was prevented in the first place by the host dsbA mutation or mutational absence of the responsible cysteine residues in PhoA (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3888-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the DTT treatment disrupts the structure once established. Our results thus indicate that post-translationally unfolded periplasmic domain can be dislocated and degraded by FtsH. It may be generalized that FtsH has the ability to degrade a periplasmic domain of a membrane protein when it was unfolded post-translationally by environmental stresses. However, for this event to happen, the cytosolic region of such a membrane protein should also be affected to be recognized by FtsH for degradation initiation. During the dislocation-unfolding events, FtsH appears to remain bound to the substrate protein, and this should provide a basis for the processive nature of the proteolysis. Indeed, the I60 intermediate was degraded when the PhoA moiety on the trans side was unfolded in our in vitro system. The PhoA domain within the YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc fusion protein may not be completely unfolded by DTT as it exhibited some degree of trypsin resistance. The presumed ATP hydrolysis-coupled dislocation activity of FtsH may unfold further such a loose structure.Our previous studies (4Akiyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8066-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that the in vivo proteolytic functions of FtsH against different substrate proteins were stimulated by PMF. This stimulation of degradation was observed both for soluble and membrane-integrated substrate proteins, the latter including YccA and Foa. Our in vitro attempts to reproduce the PMF-stimulation of membrane protein degradation has so far failed.3 Although direct comparison with the in vivo activity is difficult, the reaction efficiency in our system appears rather low. The same reaction mixture exhibited more rapid degradation of the substrates after solubilization of every component by a non-ionic detergent (data not shown). Although the inefficiency of the in vitro reaction could suggest that some stimulatory component is missing in the reaction system, the apparent degradation speeds were similar between the IMV-based and the proteoliposome-based reactions. Thus, slow reaction might be an inherent nature of the lipid bilayer-integrated reaction components in vitro. The slow reaction could be due either to a slow enzyme-substrate encountering, slow initiation of proteolysis, slow dislocation, slow catalysis, or a combination of these.Whereas our results suggest that FtsH does not need any aid from other proteins for its ability to degrade membrane-integrated substrates, more efficient and physiological reactions could still require some additional factor(s). In the case of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in eukaryotic cells, the translocon (the Sec61 complex)-mediated dislocation has been suggested. It remains possible that the E. coli translocon (the SecYEG complex) plays a similar role for the FtsH-catalyzed membrane protein degradation to occur rapidly. However, it must be stressed at this point that our results point to the ability of the FtsH protein itself to mediate the dislocation/degradation events, even if inefficiently.We feel that involvement of the SecYEG channel is unlikely for the following reasons. First, our preparations of FtsH and YccA contained undetectable levels of SecE and only minute amounts (less than 1.5% weight ratio) of SecY (data not shown). Second, IMVs from SecYEG-overproducing cells did not exhibit any enhanced activity of YccA degradation.2 Third, examination of severalsecY mutants revealed none, in which in vivodegradation of YccA was retarded significantly. 4N. Shimohata, unpublished results. In addition, the m-AAA protease, a mitochondrial counterpart of FtsH, is also believed to dislocate substrate membrane proteins for degradation (32Leonhard K. Guiard B. Pellecchia G. Tzagoloff A. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas the mitochondrial inner membrane does not contain a Sec61/SecY homolog (33Glick B.S. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2651-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Whereas FtsH-catalyzed proteolysis of membrane proteins does not require the SecYEG translocon channel as an essential component, participation of some stimulatory factor is not excluded. It should be noted also that FtsH in wild-type cells exists exclusively as a complex, termed FtsH holoenzyme, with the HflKC complex.2The roles played by the HflKC complex should also be elucidated for our understanding of regulation of the FtsH function in its proteolytic functions against membrane-integrated and soluble protein substrates. Our experimental approaches described in this paper can be extended further to address these important questions in membrane protein quality control. Cells respond to accumulation of abnormal proteins not only in the cytosol but also in membranes. Thus, a certain class of abnormal membrane proteins must be degraded rapidly. Despite the importance of membrane protein degradation, our knowledge about these processes is limited because of difficulty arising from the membrane localization of both substrates and enzymes. For instance, a question of how a peptide bond that is embedded within the lipid bilayer can receive efficient hydrolysis must be answered. Among the ATP-dependent proteases, ClpPX, ClpAX, HslUV, Lon, and FtsH, of Escherichia coli, FtsH is unique in that it is membrane-integrated and that its substrates include integral membrane proteins (1Akiyama Y. Ito K. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 1502-1504Google Scholar, 2Gottesman S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The membrane localization of FtsH is crucial for its ability to degrade membrane proteins (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3888-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the proteolytic activity of FtsH is stimulated by the proton motive force (PMF)1 across the membrane (4Akiyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8066-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Three membrane proteins have been identified as native substrates of this enzyme. Two of them, the SecY subunit of protein translocase (5Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 6Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Tokuda H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31196-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and subunit a of F1F0-ATPase (Foa) (7Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), are degraded rapidly in unassembled states. YccA, a multispanning membrane protein of unknown function, may be constitutively degraded, although it is not known whether this protein forms any complex (8Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, FtsH is known to degrade several soluble proteins (1Akiyama Y. Ito K. Barret A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 1502-1504Google Scholar, 2Gottesman S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). FtsH contains two transmembrane segments located N-terminally and a large cytoplasmic domain, which consists of two subdomains, an AAA ATPase domain and a protease domain with a zinc metalloprotease motif (HEXXH) (9Tomoyasu T. Yamanaka K. Murata K. Suzaki T. Bouloc P. Kato A. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). FtsH forms a homo-oligomer, and this feature is essential for the ATPase and the protease activities (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3888-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23485-43490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,11Akiyama Y. Ito K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7687-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). FtsH is also known to interact with a pair of membrane proteins, HflK and HflC, that forms a complex (HflKC) (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HflKC may have a regulatory role in the proteolytic functions of FtsH (8Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Mori H. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22326-22333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In vivo, FtsH exists exclusively as a large complex (estimated molecular mass of more than 1000 kDa) with HflKC in the cytoplasmic membrane. 2N. Saikawa, Y. Akiyama, and K. Ito, submitted for publication. 2N. Saikawa, Y. Akiyama, and K. Ito, submitted for publication. We proposed that FtsH exerts proteolysis against the entire molecule of a membrane-integrated substrate by dislocating it to the cytosolic side of the membrane (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3888-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This was based on our in vivoanalyses using model membrane proteins. A YccA derivative, YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc, was one of them. It was a chimeric protein having a PhoA (alkaline phosphatase mature part) sequence inserted within the third periplasmic region of this protein, which also contains C-terminally attached His6 and Myc tags. The folding state of the PhoA domain can be manipulated as its tight folding depends on the formation of the intramolecular disulfide bonds. Degradation of this fusion protein by FtsH only occurred when it had an intact N-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Although the degradation went to completion when the PhoA moiety was unfolded, it stopped before the PhoA domain when it was folded, leaving a degradation product (I60) that contained the PhoA and its C-terminal regions up to the His6-Myc tag. These degradation processes were dependent on FtsH and took place only as continuation of proteolysis initiated at the N-terminal region of the substrate. Thus, the reaction must have been processive, which is aborted before a tightly folded domain, a probable obstacle for the dislocation process. It was shown further that the degradation initiation requires cytoplasmic exposure of some 20 amino acids or longer N-terminal tail (15Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Mori H. Matsuo E. Ito K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). FtsH is also able to recognize a C-terminal tail for initiation of membrane protein degradation (16Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4775-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For our further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of polypeptide extraction from the membrane and presentation to the proteolytic active site, it is essential to develop an in vitro system, in which membrane protein degradation by FtsH can be studied using membrane-integrated enzyme and substrates. Here we report on the use of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG3350) to induce fusion of vesicles bearing the enzyme and a substrate, and thereby to reproduce subsequent degradation of the substrate upon addition of ATP. We were thus able to reconstitute ATP-dependent proteolysis of lipid bilayer-integrated substrates using purified components. Our results indicate that the dislocation-accompanied proteolytic event can occur without involving other cellular factors such as the Sec translocation channel. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we succeeded in reproducing the FtsH-catalyzed membrane protein degradation in vitro, using the enzyme and substrates, both of which were integrated into the lipid bilayer of either IMVs or reconstituted proteoliposomes. Recently, much attention has been directed to the importance of proteolytic reactions that occur in the vicinity of a membrane. Such reactions not only serve as a quality control device to eliminate unwanted membrane proteins but also as a regulatory mechanism, in which a membrane protein is cleaved to liberate and activate a regulatory domain (30Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, biochemical and molecular characterization has only insufficiently been conducted for membrane-integrated proteases. Although their enzymatic reactions in solution can be studied in vitro in the presence of a detergent and such reactions will provide some important information on the reaction parameters of the protease, many pertinent questions can only be answered by examination of reactions in which both the enzyme and substrates are engaged in their membrane-integrated states.We have shown here that PEG3350 treatment is a simple and effective method to induce fusion of membrane vesicles, and thereby to initiate interaction between a membrane-bound enzyme and a membrane-bound substrate. The size measurement results indicated that the PEG3350 treatment induces fusion of an average of ∼50 vesicles. As this method proved effective for both native IMVs and artificial proteoliposomes, it can probably be used for membrane vesicles of diverse biological sources. However, for in vitro analysis to be possible, membrane vesicles should be in such an orientation, in which enzymatic active site of the protease faces the external milieu, whose composition can easily be manipulated. The substrate should also assume the compatible orientation in the membrane vesicles. Fortunately, in our present case, the availability of inverted membrane vesicles and the asymmetric reconstitution of both FtsH and YccA allowed the strategy described above.The mode of YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc degradation in the fused IMVs was very similar to that observed in vivo, including the degradation arrest in front of the folded PhoA domain. Unfolding of the PhoA domain allowed the degradation to continue beyond the PhoA moiety over the entire molecule. Furthermore, FtsH degraded YccA in reconstituted proteoliposomes without leaving a distinct degradation product. Because the YccA11 mutant protein with the shortened N-terminal tail did not receive degradation in the reconstituted liposomes, the proteolysis in this reconstituted system could only be initiated at the N-terminal region of the fusion protein. Thus, if degradation cannot continue beyond a transmembrane region, an end product lacking only the N-terminal tail should have been detected for the YccA-HA-His6-Myc protein. The lack of such product, together with the fact that this system consisted of purified components, strongly suggests that FtsH can continue degradation of YccA-HA-His6-Myc beyond the first transmembrane segment into the periplasmic and the following transmembrane regions. These results provide strong evidence for the dislocation mechanism of the FtsH-catalyzed membrane protein degradation.Our results showed that the folded PhoA moiety of YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc could at least partially be unfolded by treatment with a high concentration (250 mm) of DTT that should have reduced the intramolecular disulfide bonds in PhoA. Although the wild-type PhoA protein exhibits significant resistance to a reducing agent (31Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8146-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the PhoA portion of the YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc fusion protein may be distorted to some extent (14Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and more susceptible to reduction, making the post-translational unfolding possible. In contrast to our previousin vivo experiments, in which the formation of the intramolecular disulfide bonds in PhoA was prevented in the first place by the host dsbA mutation or mutational absence of the responsible cysteine residues in PhoA (3Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3888-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the DTT treatment disrupts the structure once established. Our results thus indicate that post-translationally unfolded periplasmic domain can be dislocated and degraded by FtsH. It may be generalized that FtsH has the ability to degrade a periplasmic domain of a membrane protein when it was unfolded post-translationally by environmental stresses. However, for this event to happen, the cytosolic region of such a membrane protein should also be affected to be recognized by FtsH for degradation initiation. During the dislocation-unfolding events, FtsH appears to remain bound to the substrate protein, and this should provide a basis for the processive nature of the proteolysis. Indeed, the I60 intermediate was degraded when the PhoA moiety on the trans side was unfolded in our in vitro system. The PhoA domain within the YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc fusion protein may not be completely unfolded by DTT as it exhibited some degree of trypsin resistance. The presumed ATP hydrolysis-coupled dislocation activity of FtsH may unfold further such a loose structure.Our previous studies (4Akiyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8066-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that the in vivo proteolytic functions of FtsH against different substrate proteins were stimulated by PMF. This stimulation of degradation was observed both for soluble and membrane-integrated substrate proteins, the latter including YccA and Foa. Our in vitro attempts to reproduce the PMF-stimulation of membrane protein degradation has so far failed.3 Although direct comparison with the in vivo activity is difficult, the reaction efficiency in our system appears rather low. The same reaction mixture exhibited more rapid degradation of the substrates after solubilization of every component by a non-ionic detergent (data not shown). Although the inefficiency of the in vitro reaction could suggest that some stimulatory component is missing in the reaction system, the apparent degradation speeds were similar between the IMV-based and the proteoliposome-based reactions. Thus, slow reaction might be an inherent nature of the lipid bilayer-integrated reaction components in vitro. The slow reaction could be due either to a slow enzyme-substrate encountering, slow initiation of proteolysis, slow dislocation, slow catalysis, or a combination of these.Whereas our results suggest that FtsH does not need any aid from other proteins for its ability to degrade membrane-integrated substrates, more efficient and physiological reactions could still require some additional factor(s).

The vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens renders them susceptible to oxidation. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that reactive brominating species, a unique oxidant formed at the sites of eosinophil activation, such as in asthma, might selectively target plasmalogens for oxidation. Here we show that reactive brominating species produced by the eosinophil peroxidase system of activated eosinophils attack the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens. Reactive brominating species produced by eosinophil peroxidase target the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens resulting in the production of a neutral lipid and lysophosphatidylcholine. Chromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses of this neutral lipid demonstrated that it was 2-bromohexadecanal (2-BrHDA). Reactive brominating species produced by eosinophil peroxidase attacked the plasmalogen vinyl ether bond at acidic pH. Bromide was the preferred substrate for eosinophil peroxidase, and chloride was not appreciably used even at a 1000-fold molar excess. Furthermore, 2-BrHDA production elicited by eosinophil peroxidase-derived reactive brominating species in the presence of 100 μm NaBr doubled with the addition of 100 mm NaCl. The potential physiological significance of this pathway was suggested by the demonstration that 2-BrHDA was produced by phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated eosinophils and by the demonstration that 2-BrHDA is a phagocyte chemoattractant. Taken together, the present studies demonstrate the targeting of the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens by the reactive brominating species produced by eosinophil peroxidase and by activated eosinophils, resulting in the production of brominated fatty aldehydes.

Test S.T. Eckmann C.M. Roos D. Regiani S. Science. 1986; 234: 200-203Google Scholar). Through the generation of reactive brominating species and their attack of viral and microbial proteins and membrane structures, eosinophil peroxidase plays a crucial role in the antiviral and antimicrobial defense mechanisms of eosinophils (3Weiss S.J. Test S.T. Eckmann C.M. Roos D. Regiani S. Science. 1986; 234: 200-203Google Scholar). Additionally, eosinophil peroxidase likely plays an important role through the production of reactive brominating species in asthma (4Mitra S.N. Slungaard A. Hazen S.L.

Reactive chlorinating and brominating species released by activated phagocytes attack unsaturated -C=C- bonds within the aliphatic chains of phospholipids and within the steroid nucleus of sterols forming chlorohydrins and bromohydrins, which may disrupt normal membrane fluid molecular dynamics (7Carr A.C.

This mechanism may represent a major cytotoxic effect of activated phagocytes. Reactive brominating species have been shown to target unsaturated fatty acids resulting in the production of bromohydrins that may serve as markers not only of phagocyte-mediated inflammation but also specific inflammatory processes mediated by brominating oxidants (9Carr A.C.

We have recently demonstrated that plasmalogens represent accessible molecular targets of the membrane-permeable, reactive chlorinating species generated by activated phagocytes resulting in the production of α-chloro fatty aldehydes (23Thukkani A.K.

Comhair S.A. Thomassen M.J. Farver C.F. Dweik R.A. Kavuru M.S. Erzurum S.C. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1455-1463Google Scholar, 25van Dalen C.J. Kettle A.J. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2906-2913Google Scholar), the present study was designed to determine whether the vinyl ether bond of the sn-1 aliphatic chain of plasmalogens is susceptible to bromination by reactive brominating species produced by eosinophil peroxidase and to compare this putative halogenation with that mediated by reactive chlorinating species in eosinophils. The results herein demonstrate for the first time that eosinophil peroxidase utilizes micromolar concentrations of bromide at acidic pH resulting in the production of reactive brominating species that attack the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens leading to the production of lysophospholipids and α-bromo fatty aldehydes. Additionally, these α-bromo fatty aldehydes are produced by PMA-stimulated eosinophils and thus represent a previously uncharacterized product of activated eosinophils. The biological role of α-bromo fatty aldehydes is also suggested by our results showing that they are a phagocyte chemoattractant. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that plasmalogens are attacked by eosinophil peroxidase-derived reactive brominating species and suggests that this may represent a novel mechanism for plasmalogen degradation during either antiviral/antimicrobial roles of eosinophils or, alternatively, during inflammatory tissue injury in eosinophil inflammatory states such as asthma.RESULTSThe present studies were directed at determining the role of eosinophil peroxidase in the targeting of plasmalogens by reactive brominating species. As a first step, lysoplasmenylcholine (1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-GPC) was incubated with eosinophil peroxidase in phosphate buffer containing hydrogen peroxide and 100 mm sodium bromide. TLC analysis of the reaction products revealed that a neutral lipid was produced, which migrated with an Rf ≅ 0.58 in a solvent system that resolves neutral lipids (Fig. 1) when lysoplasmenylcholine is treated with eosinophil peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium bromide at pH 4 (Fig. 1, EPO/HOBr system). This neutral lipid did not comigrate with either 2-chlorohexadecanal (2-ClHDA) (Rf = 0.46) or fatty acid (Rf range for palmitic, palmitoleic, and arachidonic acid = 0.18–0.20) in this TLC system. The production of this neutral lipid was dependent on the presence of a complete reaction mixture comprising active eosinophil peroxidase (thermal treatment of eosinophil peroxidase ablated lysoplasmenylcholine loss), hydrogen peroxide, and sodium bromide (Fig. 1).Similar studies were performed utilizing the plasmenylcholine molecular species, 1-O-hexadec-1′-enyl-2-hexadecanoyl-GPC, as the target phospholipid of the reactive brominating species generated by eosinophil peroxidase. Reaction products were subjected to TLC analysis with molybdate staining of inorganic phosphate, which demonstrated plasmenylcholine loss in the presence of the complete eosinophil peroxidase reactive brominating species system at pH 4 (Fig.2 A) concomitant with the production of a polar lipid that comigrated with authentic LPC (Fig. 2 A). Additionally, under these conditions a neutral lipid that migrated with the solvent front was observed when TLC plates were charred with sulfuric acid (data not shown). Silica corresponding to regions 1 and 2 (indicated in Fig. 2) (taken from TLC plates that were developed concomitantly with those shown in Fig. 2 A) was scraped from TLC plates, and purified lipids were extracted from the silica and subjected to GC following derivatization by acid methanolysis (Fig. 2 B). This GC analysis confirmed the production of LPC in region 1 with plasmenylcholine as the target of the reactive brominating species produced by eosinophil peroxidase (+EPO in Fig. 2 B) because only the fatty acid methyl ester of palmitic acid was present (peak b) and the vinyl ether derivative, the dimethylacetal of palmitaldehyde, was absent. Examination of region 2 (Fig. 2 B), which stained positively in the +EPO sample using sulfuric acid charring, by GC analysis of acid methanolysis products revealed the presence of a peak that had an identical retention time to that of the dimethylacetal of 2-BrHDA (peak c). An additional analysis by GC of acid methanolysis derivatives of the neutral lipid produced by eosinophil peroxidase-derived reactive brominating species attack of lysoplasmenylcholine (see Fig. 1) also demonstrated that the neutral lipid was most likely 2-BrHDA, as it yielded a peak with an identical retention time as that of peak c in Fig.2 B.Figure 2TLC and GC analysis of eosinophil peroxidase-treated plasmenylcholine. A, 200 nmol of plasmenylcholine was incubated in the presence or absence of each of the EPO/HOBr-generating reagents including EPO (45 ng), H2O2 (1 mm), and NaBr (100 mm) in 500 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 4) as indicated at 37 °C for 5 min. Incubations were terminated by the addition of methanol, and reaction products were sequentially extracted into chloroform and subjected to TLC with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (6/8/2/2/1, v/v/v/v/v) as the mobile phase. Reaction products on developed TLC plates were visualized by molybdate treatment. B, parallel plates were developed identically, but silica was scraped from the regions denoted as 1 and 2, and purified lipids were extracted. These lipids were then subjected to acid methanolysis and analyzed by GC with FID detection. Peaks a,b, and c correspond to the solvent peak, the methyl ester of hexadecanoic acid, and the putative dimethylacetal of 2-bromohexadecanal, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm that the neutral lipid reaction product from the eosinophil peroxidase-mediated degradation of plasmalogens was 2-BrHDA, the TLC-purified neutral lipid product that was derivatized by acid methanolysis as well as the underivatized product were subjected to GC-MS utilizing electron impact ionization. The mass spectrum of the acid methanolysis product of the neutral lipid showed a base ion atm/z 75, which is a signature ion of dimethylacetals, acid methanolysis products of masked aldehydes (i.e. the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens) and free aldehydes (Fig. 3 A). The mass spectrum of the underivatized compound included the anticipated isotopomers of the brominated parent ions of 2-bromohexadecanal (2-BrHDA) (Fig. 3 B). These ions at m/z318 and 320 are present at a 1/1 ratio characteristic of monobrominated molecules because of the ratio of the natural isotopic abundance of 79Br and 81Br at 1/1. Two peaks consistent with the production of the syn- and anti-isomers of the PFB oxime derivative of 2-BrHDA were identified by GC-MS analyses using negative chemical ionization detection. The fragmentation pattern of the second peak is shown in Fig.4. One of the major fragments atm/z 332 is monobrominated, having an ion of equal intensity observed at m/z 334. It should be recognized that the remaining fragmentation pattern is consistent with the structure of the PFB oxime of 2-BrHDA (Fig. 4,inset).Figure 3Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the lysoplasmenylcholine/eosinophil peroxidase reaction product.Lysoplasmenylcholine (200 nmol) was incubated in the presence of the EPO/HOBr-generating system, which includes EPO (22.6 ng), H2O2 (1 mm), and NaBr (100 mm) in 500 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) at 37 °C for 5 min. Incubations were terminated by the addition of methanol, and reaction products were sequentially extracted into chloroform and subjected to TLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The TLC-purified material having anRf = 0.58 was either subjected to acid methanolysis prior to GC-MS (A) with electron impact ionization detection or subjected directly to GC-MS (B) with electron impact ionization detection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ions and ion fragments (the mass spectrum) of the major peaks are shown from the two samples.

The data shown in Fig. 5show that eosinophil peroxidase mediates the attack of plasmalogens in the presence of bromide more efficiently when also in the presence of physiological concentrations of NaCl in comparison with in the absence of NaCl. With only bromide present, 2-BrHDA production was maximal at 500 μm NaBr (Fig. 5). In contrast, the bromide requirement for maximal 2-BrHDA production was decreased to ∼100–250 μm in the presence of physiological concentrations of NaCl (100 mm) (Fig. 5). Furthermore, at physiological concentrations of NaBr (50 μm), the presence of 100 mm NaCl increased 2-BrHDA production ∼2-fold (Fig. 5). The augmentation of 2-BrHDA production by the addition of sodium chloride is only minimally due to bromide contamination in the chloride, because 2-BrHDA production in the presence of 100 mm NaCl with no addition of bromide was only half of that found with only 25 μm sodium bromide added (Fig. 5). Because of the augmentation of 2-BrHDA production by NaCl supplementation, the pH dependence was characterized with 100 μm NaBr in the presence of 100 mm NaCl. The pH optima for 2-BrHDA production by reactive halogenating species produced by eosinophil peroxidase in the presence of physiological chloride and bromide concentrations were acidic, with maximal production observed at pH 4.5 (Fig. 6). Additionally, 2-ClHDA production was not detected under these conditions (data not shown).Figure 5Augmentation of 2-BrHDA production by eosinophil peroxidase by NaCl. 50 nmol of lysoplasmenylcholine was incubated in the presence of the eosinophil peroxidase reactive halogenating species-generating system, which includes eosinophil peroxidase (22.6 ng), H2O2(1 mm), and selected concentrations of NaBr (0–100 mm), in 2 ml of phosphate buffer at pH 4 and at 37 °C for 5 min. In parallel incubations, treatments were supplemented with 100 mm NaCl as indicated. Lipid reaction products were extracted and subjected to acid methanolysis in the presence of 1-hexadecanoyl-GPC (internal standard), and derivatives were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography with FID detection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. 2-BrHDA was not detected (N.D.) in the absence of both NaCl and NaBr.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6pH dependence of plasmalogen degradation by the eosinophil peroxidase/reactive brominating species-generating system in the presence of physiological concentrations of NaCl. 50 nmol of lysoplasmenylcholine was incubated in the presence of the eosinophil peroxidase/reactive brominating species-generating system, which includes eosinophil peroxidase (22.6 ng), H2O2 (1 mm), NaCl (100 mm), and NaBr (0.1 mm) in 2 ml of phosphate buffer at the indicated pH at 37 °C for 5 min.

Sodium azide, catalase, and 3-aminotriazole inhibited eosinophil peroxidase-mediated degradation of the vinyl ether bond (Fig.7). Additionally, the specificity of the reaction of the eosinophil peroxidase-generated reactive bromine species toward the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens was demonstrated because destruction of the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens by treatment with hydrochloric acid fumes for 10 min ablated the production of the eosinophil peroxidase-mediated neutral lipid product, 2-BrHDA (Fig. 7).Figure 7Inhibition of eosinophil peroxidase-mediated plasmalogen degradation by eosinophil peroxidase pathway inhibitors and pretreatment of plasmalogens with acid vapors. 200 nmol of lysoplasmenylcholine was incubated with 22.6 ng of eosinophil peroxidase (or thermal denatured eosinophil peroxidase (Denat. EPO), 15 min at 90 °C) in the HOBr-generating buffer system (100 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm NaBr) at pH 4.0 at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence or absence of 3-aminotriazole (ATZ, 50 mm; preincubated with eosinophil peroxidase at 37 °C for 5 min prior to initiation of reaction), 10 μg/ml catalase (preincubated with reaction mixture at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of eosinophil peroxidase), or 100 μm sodium azide (preincubated with eosinophil peroxidase at 37 °C for 5 min prior to initiation of reaction) as indicated. Alternatively, 200 nmol of lysoplasmenylcholine was pretreated with HCl vapors (as indicated) and then incubated with 22.6 ng of eosinophil peroxidase in the HOBr-generating buffer system at pH 4.0 at 37 °C for 5 min. Lipid reaction products were extracted and subjected to acid methanolysis in the presence of 1-hexadecanoyl-GPC (internal standard), and derivatives were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography with FID detection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mass of product formed was calculated by comparing the integrated areas of the peak derived from plasmalogen degradation to that of the internal standard. Values are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because both eosinophil peroxidase and myeloperoxidase use both chloride and bromide, comparisons were made between these two peroxidases to determine their selectivity in using halides to produce α-halo fatty aldehydes. At pH 4, myeloperoxidase used either chloride or bromide to produce reactive halogenating species, resulting in the production of either 2-ClHDA or 2-BrHDA, respectively (Fig.8). Additionally, in the presence of both 100 μm bromide and 100 mm chloride, myeloperoxidase-derived reactive halogenating species attacked plasmalogens, resulting in the production of both 2-ClHDA and 2-BrHDA (Fig. 8). In contrast, eosinophil peroxidase was very specific for bromide as substrate, with only small amounts of 2-ClHDA produced in the presence of 100 mm chloride in the absence of bromide (Fig. 8). Furthermore, 2-BrHDA was selectively produced by eosinophil peroxidase in the presence of 100 μm bromide and 100 mm chloride (Fig. 8).Figure 8Comparisons of α-halo fatty aldehyde production by eosinophil peroxidase- and myeloperoxidase-derived reactive halogenating species. 100 nmol of lysoplasmenylcholine was incubated in the presence of either the myeloperoxidase- or eosinophil peroxidase-derived reactive halogenating species-generating systems, which includes either myeloperoxidase (0.6 units) or eosinophil peroxidase (22.6 ng), H2O2(1 mm), and the indicated concentrations of NaBr and/or NaCl in 2 ml of phosphate buffer at pH 4 and at 37 °C for 5 min.

To determine that halogenated aldehydes are produced in activated eosinophils, GC-MS analyses of their PFB derivatives were measured using a deuterated internal standard as described previously (23Thukkani A.K.

For these experiments, unstimulated (control) and PMA-stimulated human eosinophils were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 100 μmNaBr, and the production of 2-BrHDA and 2-ClHDA was determined by GC-MS of their respective PFB oximes. PMA activation of the eosinophils led to the production of 2-BrHDA and a small increase in 2-ClHDA compared with nonactivated eosinophils (Fig. 9, −PMA). Additionally, PMA-stimulated 2-BrHDA and 2-ClHDA production were blocked by the peroxidase inhibitor, sodium azide (Fig.9). The potential physiological role of 2-BrHDA as a phagocyte chemoattractant was tested. Both 90 nm and 90 μm 2-BrHDA induced neutrophil chemotaxis to a significantly greater extent than their Me2SO controls (Fig. 10). For comparison, the known potent neutrophil chemoattractant, fMLP, is shown as a positive control for chemoattraction (Fig. 10).Figure 92-BrHDA and 2-ClHDA accumulation in PMA-stimulated eosinophils.

The complete system contained 100 μm NaBr and 200 nm PMA. Following incubation, cell suspensions were snap frozen, and subsequently lipids were extracted in the presence of deuterated 2-BrHDA and 2-ClHDA.

They associate with Kv2 α-subunits forming heteromeric channels that activate, deactivate, inactivate, and recover from inactivation differently from homomeric Kv2 channels (6Kerschensteiner D.

We previously described the functional properties of heteromeric channels arising from the co-expression of Kv2.1 with Kv9.3 (Kv2.1/Kv9.3) (6Kerschensteiner D. Stocker M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 248-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Channel activation and deactivation were slowed, and their equilibrium shifted to hyperpolarized potentials when compared with homomeric Kv2.1 channels. Moreover, Kv9.3 changed the state dependence of Kv2.1 inactivation. Kv2 α-subunits have been identified as an important component of delayed rectifier currents in a variety of excitable cells where they participate in action potential repolarization, regulation of the firing frequency, and setting the resting membrane potential (20Du J.

Res. 1999; 85: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Kv2 channels reduces currents through these channels and thus regulates membrane excitability. Based on a model adapting the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model for allosteric proteins (26Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar) to ion channels, Kv2.1 has been suggested to inactivate from open and closed states (27Klemic K.G. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Jones S.W. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1779-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The maximum of inactivation in this description was assigned to the last of five closed states passed by opening channels, which is linked with the open state through a transition with a voltage-independent on rate and a voltage-dependent off rate (27Klemic K.G. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Jones S.W. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1779-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here we refer to inactivation from this last closed and from open states as open-state inactivation. The term closed-state inactivation indicates inactivation from proximal states in the activation pathway that are separated from open states by voltage-dependent transitions. For Kv2.1 open-state inactivation is fast, and closed-state inactivation slow. On the contrary, heteromeric Kv2.1/Kv9.3 channels exhibit slow open- and fast closed-state inactivation. This shift to preferential closed-state inactivation has been referred to as a change in the state dependence of inactivation (6Kerschensteiner D. Stocker M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 248-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Preferential closed-state inactivation has been suggested to participate in the control of membrane excitability by modulating repetitive firing and back-propagation of action potentials in neurons as well as the repolarization of cardiac action potentials (28Johnston D.

Covarrubias M. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here we describe a pharmacological strategy to distinguish between open- and closed-state inactivation of Kv2.1 and show that both inactivation pathways lead to the same conformation. Moreover, we investigate the structural determinants underlying the regulation of Kv2.1 by the modulatory α-subunit Kv9.3. An N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) originally characterized in Kv8.1 (30Chiara M.D. Monje F. Castellano A. Lopez-Barneo J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6865-6873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggested to govern its function was identified also in Kv9.3. However, the functional properties of chimeric Kv2.1 channels containing the NRD of Kv9.3 differed from those of Kv2.1/Kv9.3 heteromers, thereby questioning the importance of NRD in Kv9 subunits. On the contrary, we show that a single amino acid in the distal part of the pore-lining S6 determines the regulatory properties of Kv9.3. All of the DNA manipulations were carried out using standard recombinant DNA techniques (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNAs coding for Kv2.1 (DRK1) and Kv9.3 used in this study were identical to the ones described previously (6Kerschensteiner D. Stocker M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 248-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Stocker M. Kerschensteiner D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into Kv2.1 cDNA using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The chimera Kv2.1NRD was generated by replacing amino acids 127–181 of Kv2.1 by the NRD domain of Kv9.3 (amino acids 111–177). Amplification by low copy PCR (15 cycles) with the polymerase Pfu (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to generate one fragment of both Kv2.1 and Kv9.3. These fragments were then combined via a common introduced silent EcoRI recognition site and ligated into an appropriately cut Kv2.1. For all mutated or chimeric constructs, the sequence of the complete channel subunit was verified by sequencing with a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Following linearization capped cRNAs were synthesized in vitro with mMessage mMachine (Ambion, Austin, TX). Isolation of oocytes (stages V and VI) from Xenopus laevis and cRNA injection were performed as described previously (32Stuhmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were recorded 1–4 days after injection under two-electrode voltage-clamp control, using a Turbo TEC-10CD amplifier (NPI-Elektronik, Tamm, Germany). Intracellular electrodes had resistances of 0.3–0.8 MΩ when filled with 2 m KCl. The standard bath solution was normal frog Ringer containing 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2). In experiments in which KCl concentrations were raised, NaCl concentrations were lowered so that the sum of KCl an NaCl remained constant. Recordings testing the effect of internal TEA could not be performed in inside out patches because of fast rundown of Kv2.1 currents in this configuration (33Immke D. Wood M. Kiss L. Korn S.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 819-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 2D. Kerschensteiner, F. Monje, and M. Stocker, unpublished observation. We therefore injected TEA into oocytes using a glass pipette filled with 105 mmKCl, 10 mm TEACl, 2.5 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2). The currents were low pass filtered at 0.7–1 kHz (−3dB) and sampled at 3–5 kHz. All of the experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). Data acquisition and analysis were performed with the Pulse+PulseFit software package (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany), EXCEL (Microsoft), and IGOR (Wavemetrics). Boltzman functions of the typePO/PO,max = Offset + 1/(1 + exp(V12 −Vm)/a) were used to fit steady-state activation. The data are given as the means ± S.E., with n specifying the number of independent experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t test. The delayed rectifier potassium channel Kv2.1 (34Frech G.C. VanDongen A.M. Schuster G. Brown A.M. Joho R.H. Nature. 1989; 340: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) has previously been suggested to inactivate from open and closed states. This proposal was based on kinetic analyses (27Klemic K.G. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Jones S.W. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1779-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and on the observation that co-expressions of different modulatory α-subunits with Kv2.1 have opposite effects on inactivation occurring at high and low open probabilities (6Kerschensteiner D. Stocker M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 248-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Kramer J.W. Post M.A. Brown A.M. Kirsch G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1501-C1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Throughout this study open- and closed-state inactivation were measured using the pulse protocols PO inact andPC inact, respectively. ForPO inact, the membrane was depolarized for 32 s to potentials of high open probability. Time constants (τinact) derived from mono-exponential functions fit to the decay of the resulting outward currents were used to assess open-state inactivation (○ and ● in Figs.1, E and F,4D, and 5, E and F). ForPC inact, 300-ms test pulses to +40 mV were given at the beginning (P1) and end (Pn) of conditioning pulses of increasing length to potentials of low open probability. The ratio of currents elicited by the test pulses (IPn/IP1) is proportional to the number of channels that did not inactivate during the conditioning pulse and declines with increasing length of the conditioning pulse. Time constants (τinact) derived from mono-exponential functions fit to this decline were used to quantify closed-state inactivation (■ and ▪ in Figs. 1, E andF, 4D, and 5, E and F). For potentials of intermediate open probability both pulse protocols were used to measure inactivation occurring from both open and closed states (▵ and ▴ in Figs. 1, E and F, 4D, and 5, E and F).Figure 4The involvement of S6 in the regulatory function of Kv9.3.A, alignment of the last transmembrane segment (S6) for one representative member from each Kv subfamily.

Subsequently, the voltage was clamped to −40 mV, and the initial current in this segment was estimated from a mono-exponential fit to its decay. The relative open probabilities (PO/PO, max) derived from the initial currents were plotted against the voltage of the conditioning pulses and fit with a Boltzmann function (n = 9–10).

To have an additional tool for their analysis, we first investigated whether open- and closed-state inactivation can be separated pharmacologically. Kv2.1 channels were expressed inXenopus oocytes, and currents were measured under two-electrode voltage clamp conditions. The quaternary ammonium ion TEA, which blocks Kv2.1 channels (34Frech G.C. VanDongen A.M. Schuster G. Brown A.M. Joho R.H. Nature. 1989; 340: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 35Ikeda S.R. Korn S.J. J.

A. 1991; 88: 5092-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 39Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) of other Kv channels when applied to the extra- or intracellular side of the channels, respectively. Therefore, we tested whether TEA was affecting Kv2.1 inactivation when applied from either side of the membrane. After the current response was stable for at least 5 min, TEA (10 mmsolution in high K+ Ringer) was injected through a third pipette impaled into the oocyte until approximately 50% of the initial current was blocked (55.3 ± 1.2%, n = 16). This intracellular application of TEA markedly slowed the rate of open-state inactivation (Fig. 1A, Vinact = +40 mV; E, ○ and ●; p < 0.02). On the other hand, closed-state inactivation was not altered significantly by internal TEA (Fig. 1C; Vinact = −30 mV; E, ■ and ▪; p > 0.6). Accordingly, Fig. 1E shows that the effect of intracellular TEA increases with more pronounced depolarizations, corresponding to increasing open probabilities of the channels. In agreement with previous publications, extracellular TEA did not affect open- or closed-state inactivation of Kv2.1 (data not shown and Ref. 27Klemic K.G. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Jones S.W. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1779-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Additionally, we tested the influence of elevated extracellular [K+], a condition known to slow C-type inactivation of other Kv channels (40DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 617-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41Levy D.I. Deutsch C. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 798-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 42Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 951-960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Elevation of the external [K+] from 2.5 to 115 mm significantly accelerated open-state inactivation. (Fig. 1B,Vinact = +40 mV; F, ○ and ●;p < 0.01). On the contrary, closed-state inactivation was decelerated when external [K+] was increased (Fig.1D, Vinact = −30 mV; F, ■ and ▪;p < 0.02). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the two inactivation pathways for Kv2.1 can be separated pharmacologically. Open-state inactivation is inhibited by intracellular TEA and accelerated by elevated external [K+], whereas closed-state inactivation is insensitive to intracellular TEA and inhibited by elevated external [K+]. The different sensitivities of open- and closed-state inactivation of Kv2.1 to internal TEA and external [K+] could arise by either of two mechanisms. First, inactivation from open and closed states could lead to different inactivated conformations of Kv2.1 from which recovery should differ, or second, they could represent different transitions that start from open or closed channels, respectively, but lead to the same inactivated conformation. In this case recovery should be independent from the way inactivation occurred. To discriminate between the two possibilities, recovery from open- and closed-state inactivation of Kv2.1 was analyzed. As illustrated in the Fig.2A, following a 300-ms pulse to +40 mV (P1) channels were inactivated by clamping the voltage for 40 s at either +40 mV (open-state inactivation) or −40 mV (closed-state inactivation) and a second 300-ms pulse to +40 mV (P2) was given to measure the degree of inactivation. Channels were then recovered from inactivation at hyperpolarized potentials (−80 to −120 mV) for increasing time intervals before applying another 300-ms pulse to +40 mV (Pn). The number of channels that recover during this period is proportional to the ratio of currents elicited by the short pulses (IPn −IP2/IP1 −IP2) and increases with increasing time spent at the recovery potential. Time constants derived from mono-exponential functions fit to this process were used to quantify recovery. They were indistinguishable between recovery from open- (Rec −Io) and closed-state inactivation (Rec −Ic) at all potentials tested (Fig.2B, p > 0.3). Moreover, elevating the extracellular [K+] accelerated recovery to a rate that was identical for open- and closed-state inactivation (Fig.2C, p > 0.2). These observations support the idea that open- and closed-state inactivation of Kv2.1 are separate transitions leading to the same inactivated conformation. We previously characterized the modulatory α-subunit Kv9.3, which forms heteromeric channels with Kv2.1 and changes the preferred state from which inactivation occurs (6Kerschensteiner D. Stocker M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 248-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although Kv2.1 inactivates fast from open and slowly from closed states, heteromeric Kv2.1/Kv9.3 channels show little open- but fast and complete closed-state inactivation (Fig. 3, A and B) (6Kerschensteiner D. Stocker M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 248-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The molecular determinants of this regulation are unknown. The inhibition of open-state inactivation of Kv2.1 by the modulatory α-subunit Kv8.1 has been attributed to a segment of 59 amino acids preceding the first transmembrane segment (30Chiara M.D. Monje F. Castellano A. Lopez-Barneo J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6865-6873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of this region, termed NRD (30Chiara M.D. Monje F. Castellano A. Lopez-Barneo J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6865-6873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the respective region in Kv9.3 showed little sequence identity. To test whether the proposed function of this domain was conserved, chimeric Kv2.1 channels containing the NRD of Kv9.3 (Kv2.1NRD) were constructed (Fig. 3C). Steady-state activation of Kv2.1NRD was shifted in the depolarized direction with respect to Kv2.1 (Kv2.1,V12 = 3 ± 1 mV (n = 9); Kv2.1NRD, V12 = 12 ± 2 mV, (n = 12) (Fig. 3D) in contrast to what has been observed for Kv2.1/Kv9.3 heteromers, which opened at more hyperpolarized potentials than Kv2.1 (6Kerschensteiner D. Stocker M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 248-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For Kv2.1NRD, as for Kv2.1/Kv9.3 heteromers, the kinetics of activation and deactivation were slowed (data not shown), and open-state inactivation was reduced. Accordingly, at the end of 32-s depolarizing pulses to +40 mV only 34 ± 0.4% (n = 6) of the Kv2.1NRDcurrent was inactivated, compared with 84.9 ± 1.8% (n = 24) of the Kv2.1 current (Fig. 3, E andG). However, Kv2.1NRD channels did not show the prominent closed-state inactivation that is the hallmark of Kv2.1/Kv9.3 heteromers (Fig. 3B) (6Kerschensteiner D. Stocker M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 248-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the contrary, they display less closed-state inactivation than Kv2.1. Thus, following 32 s at −30 mV, 84 ± 1.1% (n = 6) of the initial Kv2.1NRD current was left compared with 59.7 ± 5.5%, (n = 16) for Kv2.1 (Fig. 3, F andG). In conclusion, the NRD of Kv9.3, rather than shifting the maximum of inactivation from open to closed states, inhibits both inactivation pathways. Hence, another region of Kv9.3 must participate in the regulation of Kv2.1. To find such alternative regions we compared the amino acid sequences of all of modulatory α-subunits (Kv5.1, Kv6.1–6.4, Kv8.1–8.2, and Kv9.1–9.3) with the sequences of Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 α-subunits and thus identified the sixth transmembrane segment (S6) as a region of interest. Fig.4A shows an alignment of the S6 in which one representative member of each subfamily was included. The second proline of a PXP motif (Fig. 4A,arrow) is conserved among all 17 α-subunits of the Kv1–Kv4 subfamilies and is replaced by serine, threonine, alanine, or histidine in all 10 modulatory α-subunits. To test the hypothesis that the alteration of this PXP motif participates in the regulatory function of Kv9.3, we mutated the proline at position 410 in Kv2.1 to the corresponding threonine of Kv9.3. The resulting α-subunit (Kv2.1-P410T) formed functional channels inXenopus oocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2055998762,"The plasminogen/plasmin system, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), its receptor (uPAR), and its inhibitor (PAI-1), influence extracellular proteolysis and cell migration in lung injury or neoplasia. In this study, we sought to determine whether tcuPA (two chain uPA) alters expression of its major inhibitor PAI-1 in lung epithelial cells. The expression of PAI-1 was evaluated at the protein and mRNA level by Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and Northern blot analyses. We found that tcuPA treatment enhanced PAI-1 protein and mRNA expression in Beas2B lung epithelial cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The tcuPA-mediated induction of PAI-1 involves post-transcriptional control involving stabilization of PAI-1 mRNA. Inactivation of the catalytic activity of tcuPA had little effect on PAI-1 induction and the activity of the isolated amino-terminal fragment was comparable with full-length single- or two-chain uPA. In contrast, deletion of either the uPA receptor binding growth factor domain or kringle domain (^kringle) from full-length single chain uPA markedly attenuated the induction of PAI-1. Induction of PAI-1 by exposure of lung epithelial cells to uPA is a newly recognized pathway by which PAI-1 could regulate local fibrinolysis and urokinase-dependent cellular responses in the setting of lung inflammation or neoplasia."

https://openalex.org/W1972650056,"Cyclin E and p27(Kip1) are key regulators for cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) acting at the G1-/S-phase transition of the cell cycle. Whereas cyclin E is required for the activation of Cdk2, p27(Kip1) is a specific Cdk inhibitor and can block cell division. High levels of cyclin E and low levels of p27(Kip1) expression have been associated with malignant lymphomas in humans; the level of p27(Kip1) is even considered of prognostic significance. However, mice that lack p27(Kip1) do not develop any malignant lymphomas despite a pronounced lymphoid hyperplasia in thymus and spleen. We have previously described transgenic mice that carry a construct in which the cyclin E cDNA is under the control of the CD2 promoter/enhancer region and thus express high levels of cyclin E in the T-cell compartment (CD2-cyclin E). These animals are not predisposed for T-cell lymphomas in the absence of other cooperating events. Here we show that T-cells from CD2-cyclin E mice that at the same time are deficient for p27(Kip1) show a significantly higher Cdk2 activity than cells from wild-type or single mutant animals. Accordingly, a higher percentage of T cells in S/G2/M phase is found in CD2-cyclin E/p27(Kip1-/-) mice. After a long latency period of over 200 days, these animals develop spontaneous monoclonal T cell lymphoma whereas none of the single CD2-cyclin E transgenic or the p27(Kip1)-deficient mice showed any sign of lymphoid malignancies. Our findings demonstrate that a deregulation of control mechanisms at the G1/S transition by the combination of high cyclin E levels in the absence of p27(Kip1) is sufficient to predispose mice to develop lymphoid malignancies and further support a role of p27(Kip1) as a tumor suppressor and of cyclin E as a dominant oncogene."

We expressed the Ca2+-binding repeats alone (Ca) or with the third epidermal growth factor-like module (E3Ca), without (Asn-700) or with (Ser-700) the disease-associated polymorphism. The intrinsic fluorescence of a single tryptophan (Trp-698) adjacent to the polymorphic residue was quenched cooperatively by adding Ca2+. The third epidermal growth factor-like repeat dramatically altered the Ca2+-dependent fluorescence transition for the Asn-700 constructs; the half-effective concentration (EC50) of Ca Asn-700 was 390 μm, and the EC50 of E3Ca Asn-700 was 70 μm. The Ser-700 polymorphism shifted the EC50to higher Ca2+ concentrations (Ca Ser-700 EC50of 950 μm and E3Ca Ser-700 EC50 of 110 μm). This destabilizing effect is due to local conformational changes, as the Ser-700 polymorphism did not influence the secondary structure of E3Ca or Ca as assessed by far UV circular dichroism. At 200 μm Ca2+, in which both E3Ca Asn-700 and Ser-700 are in the Ca2+-replete conformation at 37 °C, the fluorescence of E3Ca Ser-700 reverted to the Ca2+-depleted spectrum at 50 °C compared with 65 °C for E3Ca Asn-700.

Some patients who develop CHD prematurely (before age 45 in men and before age 50 in women) have a family history of the disease, suggesting genetic bases for premature CHD. A recent case control study (2Topol E.J. McCarthy J. Gabriel S. Moliterno D.J. Rogers W.J. Newby L.K. Freedman M. Metivier J. Cannata R. O'Donnell C.J. Kottke-Marchant K. Murugesan G. Plow E.F.

Circulation. 2001; 104: 2641-2644Google Scholar) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism in thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) that was strongly associated with familial premature CHD in patients homozygous for the single nucleotide polymorphism. The single nucleotide polymorphism results in the substitution of a serine for an asparagine at residue 700 of TSP-1. TSP-1 is a 450-kDa trimeric extracellular matrix glycoprotein that previously has been observed in atherosclerotic plaques and intimal hyperplasia (reviewed in Ref. 3Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Google Scholar). During arterial injury or upon stimulation with growth factors in vitro, TSP-1 expression in smooth muscle cells is increased (4Majack R.A. Cook S.C.

Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 24-32Google Scholar). Patients having two Ser-700 alleles also had 2-fold lower levels of plasma TSP-1 than control patients (2Topol E.J. McCarthy J. Gabriel S. Moliterno D.J. Rogers W.J. Newby L.K. Freedman M. Metivier J. Cannata R. O'Donnell C.J. Kottke-Marchant K. Murugesan G. Plow E.F. Stenina O. Daley G.Q. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2641-2644Google Scholar).A TSP-1 monomer contains an N-terminal module, an oligomerization sequence, a procollagen module, three properdin (type 1) modules, three EGF-like (type 2) modules, a number of Ca2+-binding (type 3) repeats, and a long C-terminal sequence (Fig. 1 A). The Ca2+-binding and C-terminal sequences are unique to TSPs and are highly conserved. For instance, the alignment of human TSP-1 and Drosophila TSP demonstrates exact spacing of 16 cysteines in the Ca2+-binding repeats. TSP-1 has an additional cysteine in the C-terminal globe that favors the isomerization of disulfides (9Speziale M.V. Detwiler T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17859-17867Google Scholar) and the formation of disulfide-linked complexes with thrombin (10Turk J.L. Detwiler T.C. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1986; 245: 446-454Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, rotary shadowing microscopy has shown that the C terminus of TSP-1 adopts an extended conformation (13Lawler J. Derick L.H.

Thus, the structure, stability, and cysteine reactivity of TSP-1 C-terminal sequences are Ca2+-sensitive.The Ser-700 polymorphism localizes to the beginning of the Ca2+-binding repeats (Fig. 1 B). The homologous region in TSP-5 (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP)) is linked to two related autosomal dominant syndromes of skeletal dysplasia, pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (EDM1) (17Hecht J.T.

Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 251-262Google Scholar).We hypothesized that, similar to COMP mutations, the Ser-700 polymorphism alters the conformation of the Ca2+-binding repeats of TSP-1. We characterized segments of TSP-1 comprised of the Ca2+-binding repeats (Ca) and the Ca2+-binding repeats with the third EGF-like module (E3Ca) as without (Asn-700) and with (Ser-700) the polymorphism associated with familial premature CHD. We found that the Ser-700 polymorphism causes a subtle local change in conformation that destabilizes the protein in response to lowering Ca2+ concentration or increasing temperature.DISCUSSIONThe Ser-700 polymorphism that localizes to the Ca2+-binding repeats of TSP-1 has been associated with familial premature CHD (2Topol E.J. McCarthy J. Gabriel S. Moliterno D.J. Rogers W.J. Newby L.K. Freedman M. Metivier J. Cannata R. O'Donnell C.J. Kottke-Marchant K. Murugesan G. Plow E.F. Stenina O. Daley G.Q. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2641-2644Google Scholar), raising the question of if or how this polymorphism alters the structure and function of TSP-1. The results described above indicate that the Ser-700 polymorphism is associated with a perturbation in the local conformation of the Ca2+-binding repeats of TSP-1 at low concentrations of Ca2+ or high temperatures.The Ca2+-binding repeats are highly conserved across TSP family members and species. The importance of this conservation is demonstrated by the finding that missense mutations or minor expansions/deletions in the Ca2+-binding repeats of COMP (TSP-5) cause two forms of autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (17Hecht J.T. Nelson L.D. Crowder E. Wang Y. Elder F.F. Harrison W.R. Francomano C.A. Prange C.K. Lennon G.G. Deere M. Lawler J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 325-329Google Scholar, 18Briggs M.D. Hoffman S.M. King L.M. Olsen A.S. Mohrenweiser H. Leroy J.G. Mortier G.R. Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Gaines E.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 330-336Google Scholar). These mutations often change aspartate or asparagine residues that are likely important for binding Ca2+. The Ser-700 polymorphism is similar to COMP mutations in that it localizes to the Ca2+-binding repeats of TSP-1 and changes an asparagine to serine at a site where there is either an aspartate or asparagine in all TSPs (36Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Lawler J. The Thrombospondin Gene Family. Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit, R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995: 16-20Google Scholar, 37Adolph K.W. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 177-184Google Scholar). The structural consequences of the Ser-700 polymorphism on the Ca2+-binding repeats were studied by intrinsic fluorescence and far UV CD to compare Ca2+-sensitive structural changes with and without the polymorphic residue.Intrinsic fluorescence was due to a single tryptophan, Trp-698, within the first presumptive Ca2+-binding loop of the Ca region and fortuitously only 2 residues away from the Ser-700 polymorphism (Fig. 1 B). A construct similar to our Ca construct but derived from COMP and containing PSACH and EDM1 mutations (Fig.1 B) has been expressed in bacterial or mammalian human embryonic kidney cells and assessed for altered protein structure using similar techniques (28Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Google Scholar, 29Maddox B.K. Mokashi A. Keene D.R. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol.

The single tryptophan, Trp-344, of the Ca construct from COMP is in the fourth presumptive Ca2+-binding loop, not in the same Ca2+-binding loops that harbor the D361Y EDM1 mutation and the D469Δ PSACH mutation tested (Fig. 1 B) (28Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Google Scholar). Comparing the Ca constructs of both TSPs, Trp-698 of TSP-1 titrated at a higher Ca2+concentration than Trp-344 of COMP (0.4 versus 0.2 mm) (28Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Google Scholar). Ca Ser-700 had its fluorescence transition at 0.95 mm. This increase is similar to the Ca2+-binding repeats of COMP with the D361Y EDM1 mutation that had a transition at 1.1 mm (28Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Ca2+-binding repeats harboring the more severe PSACH mutation D469Δ had a fluorescence transition similar to Ca of wild-type COMP, indicating that the location of the tryptophan may be critical for detection of conformational changes by intrinsic fluorescence.The far UV CD spectra of Ca and E3Ca had sharp minima at 202 nm and were similar to the Ca2+-binding repeats of COMP (28Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Google Scholar, 29Maddox B.K. Mokashi A. Keene D.R. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11412-11417Google Scholar, 30Kleerekoper Q. Hecht J.T. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10581-10589Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding repeats of TSP-1 and COMP exhibited transitions at 0.2 mm Ca2+ in this study and 0.3 mm Ca2+ in a study by Thur et al. (28Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Google Scholar), respectively. The Ser-700 polymorphism did not alter the Ca2+ concentration at which the far UV CD transition for Ca occurs. Similarly, the COMP Ca2+-binding repeats with and without COMP mutations D361Y, D469Δ, and D446N have been analyzed by far UV CD (28Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Google Scholar, 29Maddox B.K. Mokashi A. Keene D.R. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11412-11417Google Scholar). In both such studies, the COMP mutations did not alter greatly how the spectral changes were titrated by Ca2+. Therefore, in the absence of a major change in the CD, the Ser-700 polymorphism of TSP-1 and the D361Y disease-causing COMP mutation both cause a local structural change as assessed by fluorescence.The adjacent EGF-like module influenced the conformation of the Ca2+-binding repeats. The module affected the secondary structure at intermediate Ca2+ concentrations (Fig.2 E) such that the far UV CD transition for E3Ca occurred at 1.5-fold lower Ca2+ than the transition for Ca. E3 also caused a blue shift in the λmax of Trp-698 in the presence of Ca2+. The fluorescence transition for E3Ca occurred at 6-fold lower Ca2+ concentrations and was associated with increased positive cooperativity compared with Ca. The fluorescence transition of E3Ca also occurred at a lower Ca2+ concentration than the far UV CD transition, whereas the opposite is true for Ca, suggesting that E3 influences the structure of the adjacent first Ca2+-binding repeat (Repeat 1) that contains both Trp-698 and the Ser-700 polymorphism (Fig.1 B). Despite the stabilizing effect of the third EGF-like module on the Ca2+-binding repeats, the presence of the Ser-700 polymorphism still altered the titration of Trp-698. This finding suggests that the Ser-700 polymorphism alters the affinity and cooperativity of Ca2+ binding to Repeat 1 in intact TSP-1.Alteration of a potential Ca2+-binding residue not only alters local Ca2+ binding but also sensitizes the Ca2+-binding repeats to heating. Temperature has a quenching effect on tryptophan fluorescence regardless of protein structure (38$$Google Scholar). Although decreasing the temperature below 20 °C causes a blue shift in the λmax ofN-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide in viscous solvents (39Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 219-233Google Scholar), a red shift is not seen when the temperature is increased above 20 °C (39Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 219-233Google Scholar). Therefore, in MOPS-buffered saline at the temperature range studied, a change in temperature should not alter the λmax unless there is a change in protein structure. Our studies were carried out in 0.2 mm Ca2+, the lowest calcium concentration at which both E3Ca Asn-700 and E3Ca Ser-700 are found in calcium-replete conformations at 37 °C as assessed by intrinsic fluorescence. Increasing the temperature caused the Trp-698 in the E3Ca proteins to have increased fluorescence intensity that underwent a red shift, thereby mimicking the fluorescence pattern seen in the absence of Ca2+. The temperature-induced change occurred at lower temperatures for polymorphic E3Ca Ser-700 than wild-type E3Ca Asn-700.The pathophysiology of PSACH is likely related to the instability of COMP and its accumulation with type IX collagen and chaperone proteins in ER vesicles of chondrocytes (31Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bachinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Google Scholar, 32Vranka J.

Montufar-Solis D. Doege K. Mwalle F. Poole R. Stevens J. Duke P.J. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 251-262Google Scholar). Familial premature CHD associated with the Ser-700 polymorphism requires that both alleles encode the polymorphism, whereas PSACH and EDM1 are autosomal dominant syndromes. Because COMP is a pentamer, a mutation in one allele statistically is predicted to result in only 3.1% of the homopentamers containing all wild-type subunits. TSP-1 is a trimeric protein. If only one allele of TSP-1 encoded the Ser-700 polymorphism, then statistically 12.5% of the homotrimers would contain asparagine as residue 700 in all three subunits. TSP-1 also can heterotrimerize with TSP-2 (40O'Rourke K.M. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24921-24924Google Scholar), thereby potentially further diluting the number of TSP trimers composed of subunits containing the Ser-700 polymorphism. One may speculate that a threshold of “normal” TSP molecules protects against disease by proteins carrying destabilizing subunits. Alternatively, the Ser-700 polymorphism in TSP-1 may be less destabilizing than any of the PSACH and EDM1 mutations. It is unknown if trimeric TSP-1 containing residue Ser-700 in all subunits is destabilized in the ER. However, the observation that patients with both Ser-700 alleles have significantly lower levels of plasma TSP-1 than control patients (2Topol E.J. McCarthy J. Gabriel S. Moliterno D.J. Rogers W.J. Newby L.K. Freedman M. Metivier J. Cannata R. O'Donnell C.J. Kottke-Marchant K. Murugesan G. Plow E.F. Stenina O. Daley G.Q. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2641-2644Google Scholar) suggests that a secretion defect is present in cells that contribute to the pool of plasma TSP-1. The Ca2+ concentration of the ER has been estimated to be ∼100–800 μm depending upon the cell type and the method of measurement (41Alonso M.T. Barrero M.J. Carnicero E. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 87-96Google Scholar, 42Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Google Scholar, 43Kiryushko D.V. Savtchenko L.P. Verkhratsky A.N. Korogod S.M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 443: 643-651Google Scholar). Our fluorescence results demonstrate that the Ser-700 polymorphism causes a local change in conformation at the lower end of this Ca2+ range. Therefore, it is possible that, similar to mutant COMP, TSP-1 Ser-700 is retained in the ER because of protein aggregation with other extracellular matrix molecules and chaperone proteins. Future studies are needed both to determine whether structural alterations caused by the Ser-700 polymorphism alter the secretion of intact TSP-1 and to relate such results to coronary artery lesions of patients with familial premature CHD associated with the Ser-700 polymorphism. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in Western societies with over 50% of the cases due to coronary heart disease (CHD) 1The abbreviations used are: CHD, coronary heart disease; TSP, thrombospondin; COMP, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; PSACH, pseudoachondroplasia; EDM1, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EGF, epidermal growth factor 1The abbreviations used are: CHD, coronary heart disease; TSP, thrombospondin; COMP, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; PSACH, pseudoachondroplasia; EDM1, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EGF, epidermal growth factor (1American Heart Association 2001 Heart and Stroke Statistical Update. Dallas, TX2000: 18Google Scholar). Some patients who develop CHD prematurely (before age 45 in men and before age 50 in women) have a family history of the disease, suggesting genetic bases for premature CHD. A recent case control study (2Topol E.J. McCarthy J. Gabriel S. Moliterno D.J. Rogers W.J. Newby L.K. Freedman M. Metivier J. Cannata R. O'Donnell C.J. Kottke-Marchant K. Murugesan G. Plow E.F. Stenina O. Daley G.Q. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2641-2644Google Scholar) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism in thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) that was strongly associated with familial premature CHD in patients homozygous for the single nucleotide polymorphism. The single nucleotide polymorphism results in the substitution of a serine for an asparagine at residue 700 of TSP-1. TSP-1 is a 450-kDa trimeric extracellular matrix glycoprotein that previously has been observed in atherosclerotic plaques and intimal hyperplasia (reviewed in Ref. 3Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Google Scholar). During arterial injury or upon stimulation with growth factors in vitro, TSP-1 expression in smooth muscle cells is increased (4Majack R.A. Cook S.C.

Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 24-32Google Scholar). Patients having two Ser-700 alleles also had 2-fold lower levels of plasma TSP-1 than control patients (2Topol E.J. McCarthy J. Gabriel S. Moliterno D.J. Rogers W.J. Newby L.K. Freedman M. Metivier J. Cannata R. O'Donnell C.J. Kottke-Marchant K. Murugesan G. Plow E.F. Stenina O. Daley G.Q. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2641-2644Google Scholar). A TSP-1 monomer contains an N-terminal module, an oligomerization sequence, a procollagen module, three properdin (type 1) modules, three EGF-like (type 2) modules, a number of Ca2+-binding (type 3) repeats, and a long C-terminal sequence (Fig. 1 A). The Ca2+-binding and C-terminal sequences are unique to TSPs and are highly conserved. For instance, the alignment of human TSP-1 and Drosophila TSP demonstrates exact spacing of 16 cysteines in the Ca2+-binding repeats. TSP-1 has an additional cysteine in the C-terminal globe that favors the isomerization of disulfides (9Speziale M.V. Detwiler T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17859-17867Google Scholar) and the formation of disulfide-linked complexes with thrombin (10Turk J.L. Detwiler T.C. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1986; 245: 446-454Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, rotary shadowing microscopy has shown that the C terminus of TSP-1 adopts an extended conformation (13Lawler J. Derick L.H. Connolly J.E. Chen J.H. Chao F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3762-3772Google Scholar, 14Galvin N.J. Dixit V.M. O'Rourke K.M. Santoro S.A. Grant G.A. Frazier W.A. J.

Chem. 1982; 257: 12257-12265Google Scholar) that is sensitive to proteolytic degradation. Thus, the structure, stability, and cysteine reactivity of TSP-1 C-terminal sequences are Ca2+-sensitive. The Ser-700 polymorphism localizes to the beginning of the Ca2+-binding repeats (Fig. 1 B). The homologous region in TSP-5 (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP)) is linked to two related autosomal dominant syndromes of skeletal dysplasia, pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (EDM1) (17Hecht J.T.

To elucidate the relationship between the features of the subunit association and the thermal stability of the tryptophan synthase, the subunit association and thermal stability were examined by isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively, in comparison with those of the counterpart from Escherichia coli. The association constants between the α and β subunits in the hyperthermophile protein were of the order of 108m−1, which were higher by two orders of magnitude than those in the mesophile one. The negative values of the heat capacity change and enthalpy change upon the subunit association were much lower in the hyperthermophile protein than in the mesophile one, indicating that the conformational change of the hyperthermophile protein coupled to the subunit association is slight. The denaturation temperature of the α subunit from the hyperthermophile was enhanced by 17 °C due to the formation of the α2β2 complex. This increment in denaturation temperature due to complex formation could be quantitatively estimated by the increase in the association constant compared with that of the counterpart from E. coli.

Hyperthermophilic proteins, which retain the folded conformation and maximally express their function near the boiling point of water, have been the target of extensive studies on protein stabilization, folding, structure, and evolutionary aspects over the past decade. Much work has been done to determine the three-dimensional structures of hyperthermophile proteins and to identify the structural determinants of the enhanced stability. A comparison of the structures of proteins from hyperthermophiles with their mesophilic counterparts has led to a better understanding of several features of the hyperthermophile proteins (1Jaenicke R.

One of these is that several hyperthermophile proteins have structures with a higher degree of oligomerization compared with the mesophilic homologues. Triose phosphate isomerase from hyperthermophiles is found to be tetrameric in contrast to the dimeric form from mesophilic sources (3Kohlhoff M. Dahm A. Hensel R.

On the bases of these observations, a hypothesis has been proposed that the higher order oligomerization of subunits and strong subunit association are potentially important for enhanced stability of hyperthermophile proteins (19Jaenicke R. Schurig H. Beaucamp N. Ostendorp R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 48: 181-269Google Scholar, 20Jaenicke R. Bohm G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-748Google Scholar, 21Backmann J. Schafer G.

However, there are few studies that characterize the strength of the subunit association in the hyperthermophile proteins and quantitatively elucidate the correlation between the subunit association and stability. Elucidating the subunit association feature in hyperthermophile proteins is an important subject for understanding the mechanism of anomalous stability and of protein-protein recognition itself in oligomeric proteins. Isothermal titration calorimetry is a powerful method for thermodynamically assessing protein-protein interactions, which are especially useful for measuring association parameters. There has been little application of isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize subunit association in hyperthermophile proteins. We are now focusing our attention on the subunit association in tryptophan synthase from the hyperthermophile, Pyrococcus furiosus, in connection with thermal stability. Prokaryotic tryptophan synthase (EC 4.2.1.20) with the subunit composition α2β2 is a multifunctional and allosteric enzyme. This α2β2 complex has an αββα arrangement (23Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Google Scholar) and can be isolated as the α monomer and β2. The α and β2 subunits catalyze inherent reactions (for reviews, see Refs. 24Yanofsky C. Crawford I.P. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1972: 1-31Google Scholar, 25Miles E.W.

When the α and β2 subunits associate to form the α2β2 complex, the enzymatic activity of each subunit is enhanced by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude (for reviews, see Refs. 24Yanofsky C. Crawford I.P.

We found that tryptophan synthase (PfTSase) 1The abbreviations used are: TSase, tryptophan synthase; PfTSase, EcTSase andStTSase, tryptophan synthase from P. furiosus,E. coli and S. thyhimurium, respectively; Pfα, Pfβ2, andPfα2β2, α, β2subunits and α2β2 complex ofPfTSase, respectively; Ecα, Ecβ2 andEcα2β2, α, β2subunits and α2β2 complex ofEcTSase, respectively; Stα, Stβ2 andStα2β2, α, β2subunits and α2β2 complex ofStTSase, respectively; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol 1The abbreviations used are: TSase, tryptophan synthase; PfTSase, EcTSase andStTSase, tryptophan synthase from P. furiosus,E. coli and S. thyhimurium, respectively; Pfα, Pfβ2, andPfα2β2, α, β2subunits and α2β2 complex ofPfTSase, respectively; Ecα, Ecβ2 andEcα2β2, α, β2subunits and α2β2 complex ofEcTSase, respectively; Stα, Stβ2 andStα2β2, α, β2subunits and α2β2 complex ofStTSase, respectively; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol fromP. furiosus was also composed of α2β2, and the enzymatic activities of the α and β2 subunits separated in their active forms were stimulated by the formation of the α2β2complexes as well as the reported mesophilic prokaryotic bacterial tryptophan synthases (for reviews, see Refs. 24Yanofsky C.

Nakamura H. Ishida M. Kuramitsu S. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11062-11071Google Scholar). Tryptophan synthase from hyperthermophiles is an attractive model system for seeking correlation between subunit association and stability. In this report, to elucidate the subunit interaction feature inPfTSase in connection with thermal stability and tryptophan synthase from E. coli (EcTSase), the subunit association and thermal stability were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. The results revealed that the binding between the α and β subunits inPfTSase was strong compared with that inEcTSase, leading to the enhanced stability of the protein and the high temperature adaptation of the tryptophan synthase function. The α subunit (Pfα) from P. furiosus was expressed in theE. coli strain JM109/pα1974 (30Ishida M. Oshima T. Yutani K. FEMS Microbiol.

The expressions of trpB and trpBA were induced by isopropyl-β-d(−)-thiogalactopyranoside added at a concentration of 1 mm to the culture medium 1 h after starting the culture. After culturing for 20 h, the cells were harvested and suspended in 100 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.02 mm PLP, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT. After sonication and heat treatment of the homogenized solution for 10 min at 75 °C, cell debris and denatured E. coli proteins were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. For Pfβ2, the precipitate with ammonium sulfate at 60% saturation was dissolved in 50 ml of 25 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.02 mm PLP, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed sample was applied on a column (2.5 × 27 cm) of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 25 to 500 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT. The active fractions of the eluted solutions were concentrated and applied to a gel filtration column (Superdex TM200 26/60, Amersham Biosciences) and separated using 25 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT. The collected active fractions were finally purified by ion exchange chromatography (Q Sepharose 26/10, AmershamBiosciences) with a linear gradient of 25 to 200 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT.

PLP at a concentration of 0.1 mm was added to the solutions of the purifiedPfβ2 andPfα2β2. The α subunit from E. coli was purified as already described (31Yutani K. Ogasahara K. Tsujita T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 526-541Google Scholar) from E. coli was purified as already described (33Ogasahara K. Hiraga K. Ito W. Miles E.W. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5222-5228Google Scholar). All the purified proteins showed a single band on SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations were estimated from the absorbance of the protein solution at pH 7.0 using a cell with a light path length of 1 cm. The values of OD 1cm1% were 6.92 for Pfα, 10.18 forPfβ2 subunit, and 9.94 forPfα2β2. These values were determined based on protein assay by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as the standard protein. The concentrations ofEcα, Ecβ2, andEcα2β2 were determined using OD 1cm1% values 4.4 (34Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Suzuki M. Sugino Y. Nakanishi M. Tsuboi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 1733-1738Google Scholar), 6.5, and 6.0 (35Hathaway G.M. Crawford I.P. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1801-1808Google Scholar), respectively. Ultracentrifugation analysis was carried out in a Beckman Optima model XL-A. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 °C using an An-60 Ti rotor at a speed of 7,000–32,000 × g. Before taking the measurements, the protein solutions were dialyzed overnight against the desired buffer at 4 °C. The experiments at three different protein concentrations between 1.8 and 0.5 mg/ml were run in Beckman 4-sector cells. The partial specific volumes of 0.751 cm3/g for Pfα, 0.743 for Pfβ2, and 0.747 for Pfα2β2 were calculated from the amino acid compositions (36Durchschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1986: 45-128Google Scholar). Analysis of the sedimentation equilibria was performed using the program XLAVEL (Beckman, version 2). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed using an Omega Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Prior to the measurements, the solutions of the α and β2 subunits were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.02 mm PLP. The dialyzed samples were filtered through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane and then degassed in a vacuum. A 10-μl volume of the β2 subunit at a high concentration was injected into the 1.3155-ml sample cell containing the α subunit with a 170-s equilibration period between injections. Integration of the thermogram and the binding isotherm were analyzed using the ITC data analysis module in ORIGIN software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out using differential scanning microcalorimeters, VP-DSC (Microcal) and Nano-DSC II model 6100 (Calorimetry Science Corp.) at a scan rate of 1 °C/min. Prior to the measurements, the protein solution was dialyzed against buffer described in the legend of Fig. 5. The dialyzed sample was filtered through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane and then degassed in a vacuum. The protein concentrations during the measurements were 0.2–1.4 mg/ml. Pfα, which consists of 248 residues and has a molecular weight of 27,500, is found to exist in a monomer form in solution (29Yamagata Y. Ogasahara K. Hioki Y. Lee S.J. Nakagawa A. Nakamura H. Ishida M. Kuramitsu S. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11062-11071Google Scholar). Ultracentrifugation analysis was used to determine the association forms of the proteins translated by thetrpB and trpBA gens from P. furiosus, which were expressed in E. coli. The apparent molecular weights (M r app) at various pHs are shown in Fig. 1. The β chain is comprised of 388 residues and the calculated molecular weight is 42,500 (30Ishida M. Oshima T. Yutani K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 216: 179-183Google Scholar). TheM r app of the recombinant β was 84,000–88,000 in the pH region above 4.7, indicating that the β chain exists in a dimeric form (Pfβ2). TheM r app of the recombinant complex of α with β subunits was almost nearly equal to 2-fold (140,000) the calculated value for αβ around pH 7. These results show that tryptophan synthase from P. furiosus forms a complex of α2β2(Pfα2β2) as observed for prokaryotic tryptophan synthases from mesophiles (24Yanofsky C. Crawford I.P. Boyer P.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8194-8201Google Scholar). The M r app of thePfβ2 decreased with decreasing pH below 4.0, resulting in dissociation to a monomer at pH 3.0. As shown in Fig. 1, the M r app ofPfα2β2 decreased with decreasing pH between pH 5 and 4, although that of Pfβ2did not change. To examine the inherent feature of the interaction between Pfα andPfβ2 in comparison with EcTSase, an isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used in the absence of any substrates or ligands, and the thermodynamic parameters of the binding of Pfα with Pfβ2 were estimated. The titration in this study was performed by injecting the β2 subunit into the α subunit, in the calorimetry cell, at various temperatures and pH 7.0, because the solubility ofPfα was not sufficient for making a solution with a high concentration at pH 7.0. This was contrary to the injection used in our previous studies (33Ogasahara K. Hiraga K. Ito W. Miles E.W. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5222-5228Google Scholar, 39Hiraga K. Yutani K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 63-70Google Scholar). Fig.2 A displays the typical raw data for the calorimetric titration of the α subunit with the β2 subunit at 40 °C. The binding of Pfα with Pfβ2 was exothermic. In Fig.2 B the titration curves are plotted as the sum of the heat released by each injection, normalized by the concentration of the α subunit. The ITC titration curves for both PfTSase andEcTSase fitted well to a model of one set site (α + β ⇄ αβ) (Fig. 2 B) and permitted the extraction of the enthalpy change (ΔH) upon formation of the complex, the association constant (K), and the stoichiometry (n) (40Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Google Scholar). The Gibbs energy change (ΔG) and the entropy change (ΔS) upon the subunit association can be evaluated using the following equation, ΔG=−RT lnK=ΔH−TΔSEquation 1 where T and R are the absolute temperature and the gas constant, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters for the subunit association at various temperatures are listed in Table I.Table IThermodynamic parameters of the association of the α subunit with the β subunit in PfTSase, EcTSase, and hybrid complexes between subunits from PfTSase and EcTSase obtained by ITC measurements at pH 7.0Temperature (°C)n(β/α)KΔHΔGΔSΔCp108m−1kJ/molJ/kmolkJ/kmolPfα/β association351.20.7−9.4−46.3119.6−1.96401.11.6−26.0−49.274.043.11.22.7−27.2−51.075.4451.23.1−33.2−51.758.3471.13.9−38.4−52.644.5501.14.0−43.9−53.228.0551.16.5−53.4−55.45.9601.29.5−58.7−57.3−4.3Ecα/β association211.50.0293−15.4−36.471.7−5.56251.40.0286−33.5−36.911.4301.50.0599−56.1−39.3−55.5351.50.0400−87.4−38.9−157.1371.50.0422−101.4−39.4−200.0371.40.0340−104.4−38.8−211.5381.50.0322−105.4−38.8−213.940.071.40.0356−129.0−39.3−286.3Hybrid α/β associationPfα/Ecβ2401.10.00470−24.0−34.032.0Ecα/Pfβ2400.70.00061−2.9−28.782.0Parameters obtained by ITC are represented per molar concentration of α subunit. Open table in a new tab Parameters obtained by ITC are represented per molar concentration of α subunit. The stoichiometry (molar ratio of β/α) of association betweenPfα and Pfβ was similar to unity and did not depend on temperature. The stoichiometry for EcTSase was 1.5. In a previous study in which Ecα is injected into theEcβ2 solution, the stoichiometry is 1.4 (33Ogasahara K. Hiraga K. Ito W. Miles E.W. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5222-5228Google Scholar,39Hiraga K. Yutani K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 63-70Google Scholar). The deviation from unity may be due to a decrease in the binding ability of the β subunit with PLP, because both Ecα andEcβ2 showed a single band on SDS-PAGE (33Ogasahara K. Hiraga K. Ito W. Miles E.W. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5222-5228Google Scholar). The K values were of the order of 108m−1 in the temperature region of 40–60 °C for PfTSase and of the order of 106m−1 in the temperature region of 20–40 °C for EcTSase (Table I and Fig.3 A). The K values of PfTSase were 2 orders higher than those ofEcTSase. The negative values of ΔH for the interaction between Pfα and Pfβ were smaller that those in EcTSase (Table I and Fig. 3 B). In both cases of PfTSase and EcTSase, the ΔH values linearly correlated with temperature (Fig.3 B). The heat capacity change (ΔCp) obtained from the slope of the linear correlation was estimated to be −1.96 and −5.56. kJ/K per mole of α subunit for PfTSase andEcTSase, respectively. Fig. 4shows the temperature dependences of ΔG and ΔS together with ΔH. In the case ofPfTSase, the summation of small values of −ΔHand −TΔS yielded the Gibbs energy (ΔG) for the subunit binding reaction. In contrast, forEcTSase, the large negative values of ΔH were compensated by using the large values of −TΔS, resulting in a smaller negative ΔG. The subunit association in PfTSase was characterized by a largeK, small negative ΔH, small negative ΔCp, and small ΔS in comparison withEcTSase.Figure 4Temperature dependences of enthalpy change, entropy change, and Gibbs energy change upon association of the α with β subunits at pH 7.0.

The DSC measurement was carried out in the alkaline region, because the proteins became turbid by heating at neutral pH and they do not form a complex in the acidic region (Fig. 1). Fig.5 A shows the DSC curves forPfα, Pfβ2, andPfα2β2 at pH 9.3–9.4. ThePfα exhibited a DSC curve with a single peak at 87.2 °C (curve a in Fig. 5 A). ForPfβ2, a major peak appeared at 112.2 °C accompanied by a minor broad peak at 94.6 °C (curve b in Fig. 5 A). It was confirmed that the major and minor peaks came from the holo-Pfβ2 and apo-Pfβ2 removing cofactor PLP, respectively. In the case of Pfα2β2, separate two peaks appeared at 104.6 and 112.5 °C (curve c in Fig.5 A). The peak on the higher temperature can be assigned to that coming from Pfβ2, because the peak temperature (112.5 °C) was quite similar to that ofPfβ2 alone (112.2 °C). Therefore, the peak temperature at the lower temperature could be considered to arise fromPfα. Table II lists the T d values of individual subunits in the isolated and complex forms, where T d values represent the peak temperature of DSC curves. TheT d value of Pfα alone was lower by 25 °C than that of Pfβ2. However, theT d value of Pfα was enhanced by 17.4 °C due to the complex formation. The T dvalue of Pfβ2 did not change due to the complex formation. On the other hand, the T dvalue of Ecα (53.0 °C) slightly increased by 1.7 °C due to the α2β2 complex formation at pH 8.4 (curves a and c in Fig. 5 B and TableII). The T d value ofEcβ2 (80.3 °C) at pH 8.2 did not change by complex formation (curves b and c in Fig.5 B and Table II). The stabilization of Pfα due to the complex formation might be correlated with a strong subunit association with a higher K value obtained by ITC. Remetaet al. (41Remeta D.P. Miles E.W. Ginsburg A. Pure Appl. Chem. 1995; 67: 1859-1866Google Scholar) have reported that the DSC curve ofStα2β2 at pH 8.0 showed two separate peaks at the denaturation temperatures of isolatedStα and Stβ2. Each of theT d values of Ecα andEcβ2 was similar to those of the reportedStα and Stβ2.T d values of Pfα andPfβ2 were drastically higher by 34.2 and 31.9 °C than those of Ecα andEcβ2, respectively.Table IIDenaturation temperature (Td) of α and β2 subunits in the isolated forms and in the α2β2 complexes for both P. furiosus and E. coli proteinsSubunitsT d(°C)ΔT d2-cThe differences in theT d values of individual subunits in the isolated and homo complex forms.(°C)Isolated form2-aFrom panels A andB in Fig. 5.Homo complex form2-aFrom panels A andB in Fig. 5.Hybrid complex form2-bFrom panel C in Fig. 5for the hybrid complexes between the Pf subunits andEc subunits.Pfα87.2 (pH 9.37)104.6 (pH 9.30)86.4 (pH 9.50)17.4Pfβ2112.2 (pH 9.30)112.5 (pH 9.30)111.6 (pH 9.49)0.3Ecα53.0 (pH 8.40)54.7 (pH 8.40)53.5 (pH 9.49)1.7Ecβ280.3 (pH 8.21)79.9 (pH 8.40)71.5 (pH 9.50)−0.4The T d values represent the peak temperature of the DSC profiles measured at scan rate of 1 °C/min.2-a From panels A andB in Fig. 5.2-b From panel C in Fig. 5for the hybrid complexes between the Pf subunits andEc subunits.2-c The differences in theT d values of individual subunits in the isolated and homo complex forms.

To explore which of the α and (or) β subunits corresponds to the strong association in PfTSase, the interaction between the Pf subunits and Ecsubunits was examined by ITC. The ITC data at 40 °C demonstrated that the K values upon formation of the hetero complex between the Pf subunits and Ec subunits were lower than those of the homo complexes (Table I). The Kvalue strongly decreased by 4 and 3 orders of magnitude for thePfβ2-Ecα andEcβ2-Pfα associations, respectively, compared with that for thePfα-Pfβ2 association. These results suggest that the conformation of the subunit interface inPfTSase differs from that in EcTSase. Fig. 5 C shows the DSC curves of the complexes with hetero subunits. The peak positions for bothPfα2 Ecβ2 andEcα2 Pfβ2 appeared at temperatures corresponding to each of the component subunits (TableII), i"
https://openalex.org/W1989701241,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many genes encoding enzymes involved in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis are expressed preferentially near the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. The relationship between the induction of deoxyribonucleotide-synthesizing genes, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate levels, and replication initiation was investigated using α factor-synchronized wild-type yeast or dbf4 yeast that are temperature-sensitive for replication initiation. Neither the timing nor extent of gene induction was inhibited when α factor-arrested dbf4 cells were released into medium containing the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea, which blocks replication fork progression, or were released at 37 °C, which blocks replication origin firing. Thus, the induction of deoxyribonucleotide-synthesizing genes at G1/S was fully independent of DNA chain elongation or initiation. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate levels increased severalfold at G1/S in wild-type cells and in dbf4 mutants incubated at the non-permissive temperature. Thus, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate accumulation, like the induction of deoxyribonucleotide-synthesizing genes, was not dependent on replication initiation. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate accumulation at G1/S was suppressed in cells lacking Swi6, a transcription factor required for normal cell cycle regulation of deoxyribonucleotide-synthesizing genes. The results suggest that cells use gene induction at G1/S as a mechanism to pre-emptively, rather than reflexively, increase the synthesis of DNA precursors to meet the demand of the replication forks for deoxyribonucleotides. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many genes encoding enzymes involved in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis are expressed preferentially near the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. The relationship between the induction of deoxyribonucleotide-synthesizing genes, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate levels, and replication initiation was investigated using α factor-synchronized wild-type yeast or dbf4 yeast that are temperature-sensitive for replication initiation.

In all eukaryotic cells many of the genes encoding enzymes involved in DNA precursor synthesis are induced as cells reach the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. In budding yeast, this class of genes contains an upstream element termed a Mlu1 cell cycle box (MCB) 1The abbreviations used are: MCB, Mlu1 cell cycle box; dNTP, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate; HU, hydroxyurea; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; YEPD, yeast extract peptone dextrose; START, point at which yeast becomes committed to complete the cell cycle that binds a multimeric complex containing the proteins Swi6 and either Swi4 or Mbp1 (1Lowndes N.F.

Mutation of the MCB elements in the upstream region of the TMP1 (CDC21) gene encoding thymidylate synthase strongly inhibits promoter activity (5McIntosh E.M. Atkinson T. Storms R.D. Smith M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 329-337Google Scholar). Deletion of theSWI6 gene disrupts normal cell cycle-regulated expression of several MCB element-containing genes (1Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Breeden L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1992; 357: 505-508Google Scholar, 2Dirick L. Moll T. Auer H. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1992; 357: 508-513Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, genes preferentially expressed at G1/S also contain an identifiable upstream element, termed an E2F site, that resembles the yeast MCB element and that binds heterodimers of the E2F and DP1 family of proteins (6Merrill G.F. Morgan B.A. Lowndes N.F. Johnston L.H. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 823-830Google Scholar). Experiments described herein address two questions regarding MCB gene induction at G1/S. First, we ask whether MCB gene induction is in part dependent on DNA replication. In a screen for yeast mutations that result in rescued expression of MCB-dependent reporter genes in Δswi6 null yeast, thioredoxin reductase was identified as a negative regulator of MCB element activity (7Machado A.K. Morgan B.A. Merrill G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17045-17054Google Scholar). Because thioredoxin is a donor of electrons in the reaction catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), and increased flux through RNR would be expected to occur as cells entered S phase and began consuming dNTPs, we speculated that a transient episode of RNR-mediated thioredoxin oxidation may contribute to MCB gene induction at G1/S (7Machado A.K. Morgan B.A. Merrill G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17045-17054Google Scholar). Implicit in this model is the prediction that MCB gene induction should be suppressed under conditions in which replication initiation is inhibited. In higher eukaryotes, the timing of replication initiation can be determined accurately by assaying for incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine or radiolabeled thymidine. The absence of a thymidine kinase enzyme precludes similar determination in yeast. The transition from G1 to S in yeast is generally assayed by flow cytometry. However, flow cytometric analysis of bulk DNA content is not a sensitive measure of the time at which cells begin synthesizing DNA. Thus, the relative timing of MCB gene induction with respect to replication origin firing is unclear. Genetic experiments have established that other events that occur at about the time of the G1/S transition occur independently of DNA replication. For example, bud emergence and spindle pole body duplication occur on schedule after START when DNA chain elongation or initiation is inhibited by using the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) or various cdc mutations (8Hartwell L.H. Culotti J. Pringle J.R. Reid B.J. Science. 1974; 183: 46-51Google Scholar). Similar experiments on MCB gene induction have either not been done or yielded equivocal results. In asynchronous yeast, HU has been shown to induce several MCB-containing genes, including RNR1, RNR2, andTMP1 (9Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Google Scholar, 10Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 333-339Google Scholar), suggesting that replication was not necessary for MCB gene induction. However, HU triggers the replication-arrest checkpoint (11Allen J.B. Zhou Z. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2401-2415Google Scholar) and induction of MCB genes due to triggering of this checkpoint may mask whether replication is required for MCB gene induction at G1/S during a normal cell cycle. A more definitive experiment was done by White and colleagues (12White J.H. Green S.R. Barker D.G. Dumas L.B. Johnston L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 171: 223-231Google Scholar), who showed that the induction of three MCB genes (CDC8,CDC9, and TMP1) occurred on schedule in synchronized cdc4 mutants that were incubated at the non-permissive temperature for S phase entry. Although the result implies that DNA replication is not required for the timing of MCB gene induction, the level of MCB gene induction was significantly reduced at the non-permissive temperature. CDC4 encodes a ubiquitin ligase needed for destruction of the Cdc28/Clb inhibitor Sic1. Full induction of MCB gene expression at G1/S may thus require either DNA synthesis or some other process downstream from Cdc28/Clb activation. Analysis of MCB gene induction in a temperature-sensitivedbf4 mutant, in which replication origin firing is specifically inhibited at the non-permissive temperature (13Sclafani R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2111-2117Google Scholar), would address this issue. A second question concerning MCB gene induction at G1/S is whether the increased levels of mRNAs encoding DNA precursor-synthesizing enzymes are associated with changes in dNTP levels. Ribonucleotide reductase, thymidylate synthase, and thymidylate kinase are essential enzymes dedicated to synthesizing DNA precursors. It is generally assumed that a mechanism for inducing these genes at G1/S evolved to meet the demands of the replication forks for DNA precursors. However, this assumption has not been tested. Also untested is whether replication initiation is associated with a decrease in dNTP levels (through their consumption at replication forks), constant dNTP levels (through allosteric regulation of dNTP-synthesizing enzymes), or an increase in dNTP levels (through non-allosteric mechanisms such as MCB gene induction). To address the first of these questions, we measured MCB gene mRNA levels in α factor-synchronized dbf4 yeast that were incubated with HU to block DNA chain elongation or were incubated at the non-permissive temperature to block DNA chain initiation. To address the second question we measured dNTP levels in α factor-synchronized wild-type yeast and dbf4 yeast at the permissive and non-permissive temperature, and in Δswi6yeast that have previously been shown to express MCB genes throughout the cell cycle (1Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Breeden L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1992; 357: 505-508Google Scholar, 2Dirick L. Moll T. Auer H. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1992; 357: 508-513Google Scholar). Our results show that MCB gene induction and dNTP accumulation occur at G1/S in the absence of replication initiation and that Swi6 protein is required for a normal pattern of dNTP accumulation. Cells were grown in YEPD medium (1% bacto-yeast peptone, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% dextrose). Yeast strains are listed in TableI. MY273 and SY2626 are derivatives of W303–1 that carry a bar1 mutation to facilitate α factor synchronization. To derive the dbf4–1 bar1 strain MY317, MY273 was mated to L128–20 (14Chapman J.W. Johnston L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 419-428Google Scholar) and random spores from the resulting diploid were screened for α factor and temperature sensitivity. G1-arrested cells were obtained by treating exponentially growing bar1 cells with 100 ng/ml α factor for 3 h at 25 °C. To achieve synchrony, arrested cells were collected on Whatman #1 filters, washed once with fresh YEPD and once with 100% conditioned medium, resuspended in 25% conditioned medium, and incubated at either 25 °C or 37 °C.

Osley M.A. Ludwig 2nd, T.R. McLaughlin C.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 367-375Google Scholar) into the EcoRV site of pBS-KS(+). The plasmids pBS-H2A and pBS-ADK1 were constructed from pBS-TRT1 by dropping out a 750-bp SacII fragment containing theADK1 gene or a 1143-bp HincII fragment containing the H2A gene, respectively. Plasmid pBS-TMP1 was described previously (7Machado A.K. Morgan B.A. Merrill G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17045-17054Google Scholar). About 5 × 106 cells were collected by centrifugation and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. After microcentrifugation (10,000 rpm, 5 s), the cell pellet was washed with 100 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.0), resuspended in 100 μl of sodium citrate buffer, and sonicated for 6 s. After a 1-h incubation at 55 °C with RNase A (0.25 mg/ml) and a 1-h incubation with proteinase K (1 mg/ml), 100 μl of sodium citrate buffer containing 16 μg/ml propidium iodide was added and samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight in the dark. A Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer was used to analyze the samples. For each histogram, 25,000 cells were analyzed. Total cellular RNA was isolated from yeast by using glass beads and hot phenol (16Aves S.J. Durkacz B.W. Carr A. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 457-463Google Scholar) and quantitated byA 260, assuming 1 OD = 40 μg/ml. Using a NorthernMax kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), 8 μg of RNA from each sample was fractionated by formaldehyde/agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted to a positively charged BrightStar Plus nylon membrane (Ambion Inc.). After UV cross-linking at 1200 J using a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), membranes were prehybridized and hybridized with probes as described by the kit manufacturer. Probes (>2 × 108 cpm/μg) were made using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mm, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and a random priming DNA labeling system kit (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) as described by the manufacturer, except that incorporated radioactivity was isolated by using a QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Hybridization probes were: RNR1, 2.6-kbEcoR1 fragment from pSE738 (S. Elledge, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX); CDC9, 2.7-kb SstI fragment from pR12SeLig2 (L. Johnston, National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK); H2A/ADK1, 2.3-kb SstI fragment from pTRT1 (15Hereford L.M. Osley M.A. Ludwig 2nd, T.R. McLaughlin C.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 367-375Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to PhosphorImager plates for 3 days and analyzed using a PSI486 PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmid pBS-TMP1 was cleaved with EcoR1 and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase to generate a 1314-base TMP1 pseudo-RNA, or cleaved with SalI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate a radiolabeled 269-base riboprobe that was complementary to a 200-base sequence near the 3′-end of the TMP1 mRNA. The plasmid pBS-H2A was cleaved withPvuII and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase to make an 860-base H2A pseudo-RNA, or cleaved with HindIII and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate a 735-base riboprobe that was complementary to a 356-base segment of the H2A mRNA. The plasmid pBS-ADK1 was cleaved with HindIII and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase to make a 311-base ADK1 pseudo-RNA or was cleaved with BglII and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to give a 129-base riboprobe that was complementary to a 48-base segment of the ADK1 mRNA. In vitro transcription and RNase protection protocols were as described by Schmidt and Merrill (17Schmidt E.E. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21247-21256Google Scholar) except that chicken embryo RNA was used as carrier instead of yeast RNA. Approximately 3 × 108 yeast cells were harvested and extracted as described by Muller (18Muller E.G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24466-24471Google Scholar). Each precipitated sample was resuspended in 200 μl of cold deionized H2O and assayed for each of the four dNTPs by the DNA polymerase-based enzymatic method (19North T.W. Bestwick R.K. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6640-6645Google Scholar), which is based on the incorporation of a limiting dNTP by Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of an excess of3H-labeled complementary dNTP with poly(dA-dT) or poly(dI-dC) as template. Raw dNTP pool data (moles per sample) were normalized by dividing by the number of cells per sample (to obtain attomoles/cell) or by the cellular volume per sample (to obtain the molar concentration). Cell number per sample was determined by hemacytometer counting or flow cytometry. Cellular volume per sample was calculated from the A 600 of the culture at the time of harvesting (1 OD = 1.0 μl of cellular volume). The relationship between optical density and cellular volume was spectrophotometer-specific and was established experimentally for our instrument using exponentially growing wild-type yeast (42 femtoliters per haploid cell) as a standard (20Jorgensen P. Nishikawa J.L. Breitkreutz B.J. Tyers M. Science. 2002; 297: 395-400Google Scholar). MCB gene induction occurs at about the same time as replication initiation in yeast synchronized by a variety of methods (1Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Breeden L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1992; 357: 505-508Google Scholar, 5McIntosh E.M. Atkinson T. Storms R.D. Smith M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 329-337Google Scholar, 21Price C. Nasmyth K. Schuster T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 543-556Google Scholar). To determine whether replication contributes to MCB gene induction, the levels of several MCB gene mRNAs were determined in α factor-synchronized dbf4 mutant cells that were incubated at the permissive temperature in the absence or presence of HU, or were incubated at the non-permissive temperature for Dbf4 protein function. We first concentrated on the effect of HU on MCB gene induction. HU inhibits ribonucleotide reductase by destroying a tyrosyl radical essential for catalytic activity (22Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Google Scholar) and has been shown to block replication in a variety of cells. To determine the kinetics with which cells synthesized DNA in the absence of HU and to confirm that cells did not synthesize DNA in the presence of HU, cells were stained with propidium iodide and DNA content was determined by flow cytometry (Fig.1 A). After a 3-h preincubation with α factor, all cells had a 1C DNA content, confirming that the pheromone had arrested all cells at START. When released from α factor in the absence of HU, a shift in DNA content indicative of S phase entry was observed within 40 min. In contrast, when released from α factor in the presence of HU, cells retained a 1C DNA content throughout the course of the experiment. Fig. 1 B shows Northern blot analyses of three representative MCB gene mRNAs (RNR1, RNR2, and CDC9). RNR1 and RNR2 encode the large and small subunits of ribonucleotide reductase, respectively. CDC9 encodes DNA ligase. The constitutive ADK1 mRNA, encoding adenylate kinase, was used as a loading control, and the S phase-specific H2A mRNA was used to assess the fraction of replicating cells in the population (15Hereford L.M. Osley M.A. Ludwig 2nd, T.R. McLaughlin C.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 367-375Google Scholar). As expected, the levels of all three MCB gene mRNAs decreased when asynchronous cells were arrested in G1 by treatment with α factor. Also as expected, all three MCB gene mRNAs transiently increased when cells were released from α factor in the absence of HU. MCB gene mRNA levels began to increase by 20 min after release and reached maximal levels by 40 min. Significantly, all three MCB gene mRNAs also increased on schedule when cells were released from α factor in the presence of HU. In contrast, induction of the S-phase-specificH2A gene was almost completely inhibited in the presence of HU, confirming that replication-dependent H2Agene expression was suppressed in HU-treated cells. Fig. 1 Cshows densitometric quantitation of the Northern blot data. Using the average of both zero time values as the baseline and the 40-min value as the maximally induced level, RNR1 mRNA increased 16-fold in the absence of HU and 18-fold in the presence of HU. Over the same time interval, RNR2 mRNA increased 1.6-fold in the absence of HU and 2.6-fold in the presence of HU, and CDC9 mRNA increased 2.5-fold in the absence of HU and 2.9-fold in the presence of HU. Thus, not only was the timing of MCB gene induction unaffected by the presence of HU, but the magnitude of the induction was unaffected as well. Similar results were obtained when cells were synchronized by release from acdc15-induced mitotic arrest (data not shown). Interestingly, although MCB gene mRNA levels increased on schedule in HU-treated cells, they did not decrease on schedule. High MCB mRNA levels persisted in HU-treated cells, long after non-treated control cells showed a decrease in levels (Fig. 1, B andC, and data not shown). In fact, RNR2 mRNA continued to increase in HU-treated cells throughout the duration of the experiment. Persistence of MCB gene messages at late time points in HU-treated cells suggested either that DNA replication was necessary to repress MCB gene expression in late S phase or G2 or that the HU-induced replication arrest was triggering MCB gene expression by a separate mechanism that camouflaged the normal down-regulation of MCB gene expression late in the cell cycle. Experiments below, in which Dbf4 inactivation was used to block replication, favor the latter explanation. The observation that MCB gene induction in the presence of HU occurred at about the same time and to at least the same extent as in the absence of HU implied that replication per se was not a prerequisite for MCB gene induction. However, as HU blocks only DNA chain elongation and not chain initiation, it remained possible that events closely associated with replication origin firing contributed to MCB gene induction at G1/S. To address the question of whether replication initiation, as opposed to DNA chain elongation, was required for MCB gene induction, we analyzed MCB gene mRNA levels in α factor-synchronizeddbf4 cells incubated at the permissive and non-permissive temperature. Dbf4 protein, together with Cdc7, forms a protein kinase holoenzyme that phosphorylates the origin-associated protein Mcm2 and catalyzes one of the last known steps in the chain of events linking START and origin firing (13Sclafani R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2111-2117Google Scholar). At the non-permissive temperature,dbf4 cells released from α factor are able to bud and accumulate mass but are unable to initiate replication (23Johnston L.H. Thomas A.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 186: 445-448Google Scholar). As shown by the flow cytometry data in Fig.2 A, α factor-synchronizeddbf4 cells began to enter S phase about 40 min after release at the permissive temperature (25 °C) but did not enter S phase when released at the non-permissive temperature (37 °C). Fig.2 B shows a Northern blot analysis of RNR1, RNR2, and CDC9 mRNA, as well as SWI4 mRNA. The SWI4 gene contains MCB elements, is induced in late G1, and encodes a transcription factor that may autostimulate MCB gene expression (24Foster R. Mikesell G.E. Breeden L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 3792-3801Google Scholar). The levels of all four MCB gene mRNAs decreased when asynchronousdbf4 cells were arrested in G1 by treatment with α factor. When α factor was removed and the cells were incubated at the permissive temperature (25 °C), all four MCB gene mRNAs transiently increased, reaching maximal levels in about 20 min. Significantly, when dbf4 cells were released from α factor at the non-permissive temperature (37 °C), RNR1, RNR2, CDC9, and SWI4 mRNA increased to the same extent and with the same kinetics as when cells were released at 25 °C. In contrast, the increase in histone H2A mRNA, which peaked 60 min after α factor release at 25 °C, was strongly inhibited in cells released from α factor at 37 °C, confirming that replication-dependentH2A gene expression was suppressed indbf4-arrested cells. Densitometric quantitation of the Northern blot results is shown in Fig. 2 C. In this experiment, peak RNR1, SWI4, and CDC9 mRNA levels occurred 20 min after pheromone release at both 25 °C and 37 °C. Using the average of both zero-time values as baseline, RNR1 mRNA increased 20-fold at 25 °C and 39-fold at 37 °C, SWI4 mRNA increased 10-fold at 25 °C and 9-fold at 37 °C, and CDC9 mRNA increased 8-fold at 25 °C and 9-fold at 37 °C. Peak RNR2 mRNA occurred 60 min after release at 25 °C and 40 min after release at 37 °C. RNR2 increased 7-fold at both 25 °C and 37 °C. In contrast to MCB gene mRNAs, which increased roughly the same amount at both 25 °C and 37 °C, histone H2A mRNA accumulation was inhibited at 37 °C. H2A mRNA peaked 60 h after pheromone release, by which time it had increased 19-fold at 25 °C and only 2.7-fold at 37 °C.H2A gene transcription is tightly linked to replication (15Hereford L.M. Osley M.A. Ludwig 2nd, T.R. McLaughlin C.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 367-375Google Scholar), and the inhibition of H2A mRNA accumulation observed at 37 °C supports the flow cytometry data showing that very few cells entered S phase in the dbf4 population incubated at 37 °C. To substantiate the conclusion that MCB gene induction was independent of replication initiation, the levels of a fifth MCB gene mRNA were determined in dbf4 cells released from α factor at the permissive and non-permissive temperature. The TMP1 gene (CDC21), which encodes thymidylate synthase, contains two canonical MCB elements in its upstream region, and is the gene in which the cis-acting function of MCB elements is best characterized (5McIntosh E.M. Atkinson T. Storms R.D. Smith M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 329-337Google Scholar). Because TMP1 mRNA is difficult to detect by Northern blot assay, an RNase protection assay was used to quantitate this message. In addition, by analyzing known amounts of synthetic TMP1 pseudo-mRNA, the absolute level of TMP1 mRNA in experimental samples was determined. As shown in Fig. 2 D, asynchronous cultures had an average of eight TMP1 mRNA molecules per cell, and this number decreased to one molecule per cell in α factor-treated cultures. By 30 min after α factor release at the permissive temperature, TMP1 mRNA had increased to 14 molecules per cell. Significantly, a similar increase in TMP1 mRNA, to 19 molecules per cell, occurred by 30 min after α factor release at the non-permissive temperature. In summary, the results in Fig. 2 show that MCB gene induction is wholly independent of replication initiation. MCB gene induction occurred at the same time and to an equal extent in dbf4cells incubated at either the permissive or non-permissive temperature for replication initiation. The results are inconsistent with models in which MCB gene induction is triggered or modulated by signals potentially associated with S phase entry, such as dNTP depletion or RNR-mediated oxidation of thioredoxin to meet the demands of the replication forks for dNTPs (7Machado A.K. Morgan B.A. Merrill G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17045-17054Google Scholar). It should also be noted that S phase entry was not needed for MCB gene repression at later time points, because MCB gene mRNA levels decreased with similar kinetics at 25 °C and 37 °C at later times after α factor release. Thus, the earlier noted persistence of MCB gene messages in HU-treated cells was probably due to the replication-arrest checkpoint mechanism rather than a requirement for DNA replication for MCB repression in late S phase. In summary, the above results indicated that neither DNA chain initiation nor elongation was necessary for MCB gene induction at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. Many MCB genes encode enzymes dedicated to DNA precursor biosynthesis. It was not clear whether induction of these genes at G1/S served to increase dNTP levels or to restore dNTP levels that were depleted by the replication process. To address this question we measured the levels of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates in yeast cells synchronized by α factor block and release. Fig. 3 B shows dNTP pool data represented on a per cell basis. Asynchronous cells contained 1.68 attomoles of dTTP, 1.36 attomoles of dATP, 0.64 attomoles of dCTP, and 0.52 attomoles of dGTP. Thus, asynchronous yeast contained a total of 1.8 × 106 dNTP molecules or about 7.5% of that minimally needed for replication of the genome. The levels of all four dNTPs decreased when asynchronous cells were incubated with α factor. When α factor was removed, the levels of all four dNTPs transiently increased, reaching maximum levels in about 80 min. Parallel flow cytometry measurements of DNA content (Fig. 3 A) confirmed that asynchronously growing cells arrested with a 1C complement of DNA when incubated in α factor and that most cells entered S phase about 40 min after pheromone was removed. Similar results were obtained when dNTP pools were measured in cell synchronized by release from acdc15-induced mitotic block (data not shown). In comparing dNTP pool sizes in synchronized cells, it is important to consider cell volume changes during the cell cycle. Volume changes are also an important consideration when comparing dNTP levels in yeast carrying mutations that affect cell size, or when co"
https://openalex.org/W2069964575,"Several viruses target cellular promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) to induce their disruption, marked morphological changes in these structures or the relocation to PML-NB components to the cytoplasm of infected cells. PML conversely interferes with viral replication. We demonstrate that PML acts as a coactivator for the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax oncoprotein without direct binding. Tax was identified within interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs)/RNA splicing bodies (SBs), not PML-NBs; Tax expression did not affect PML-NB formation. Moreover, PML and CBP/p300 cooperatively activated Tax-mediated HTLV-1-LTR-dependent gene expression. Interestingly, two PML mutants, PML-RAR and PMLDelta216-331, which fail to form PML-NBs, could also coactivate Tax-mediated trans-acting function but had no effect on retinoic acid receptor (RAR)- or p53-dependent gene expression. In contrast, SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors), a nuclear corepressor found within the matrix-associated deacetylase (MAD) nuclear body, relocalized into Tax-associated nuclear bodies upon coexpression with Tax. SMRT coactivated the trans-acting function of Tax through direct binding. Coexpression of SMRT and PML resulted in an additive activation of Tax trans-acting function. Thus, crosstalk between distinct nuclear bodies may control Tax function."

The purposes of this study were to examine the Cys residues of the transmembrane domain of metallocarboxypeptidase D (CPD) that could be a target for palmitoylation and to clarify the function of this modification. CPD is an integral membrane protein that cycles between the trans Golgi network and the plasma membrane. We constructed AtT-20 cells stably expressing various constructs carrying a reporter protein (albumin) fused to a transmembrane domain and the CPD cytoplasmic tail. Some of the constructs contained the three Cys residues present in the CPD transmembrane region, while other constructs contained Ala in place of the Cys. Constructs carrying Cys residues were palmitoylated, while those constructs lacking the Cys residues were not. Because palmitoylation of several proteins affects their association with cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich membrane domains or caveolae, we tested endogenous CPD and several of the reporter constructs for resistance to extraction with Triton X-100. A construct containing the Cys residues of the CPD transmembrane domain was soluble in Triton X-100 as was endogenous palmitoylated CPD, indicating that palmitoylation does not target CPD to detergent-resistant membrane rafts. Interestingly, constructs of CPD that lack palmitoylation sites have an increased half-life, a slightly more diffuse steady-state localization, and a slower rate of exit from the Golgi as compared with constructs containing palmitoylation sites.

Carboxypeptidases perform a wide variety of roles, ranging from digestion of food to the selective biosynthesis of hormones and neuropeptides (1Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Barrett A.J.

Among all members of this N/E subfamily, CPD has a number of unique properties. Unlike the other metallocarboxypeptidases, CPD is broadly distributed among mammalian tissues where it is enriched in the trans Golgi network (TGN) (3Xin X. Varlamov O. Day R. Dong W. Bridgett M.M.

DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 897-909Google Scholar, 4Tan F. Rehli M. Krause S.W. Skidgel R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 81-87Google Scholar, 6Kuroki K. Eng F. Ishikawa T. Turck C. Harada F. Ganem D. J.

In addition, CPD consists of multiple carboxypeptidase domains that are present in the lumen of the TGN; this multiple catalytic domain structure is found in CPD homologs in Drosophila,Aplysia, duck, and all mammalian species investigated (3Xin X.

As a result of its broad distribution, subcellular localization, and specificity for C-terminal Lys and Arg residues, CPD is thought to function following the action of furin, proprotein convertase 7 (PC7, also known as lymphoma proprotein convertase), and related endopeptidases in the processing of proteins that transit the secretory pathway (11Fricker L.D. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 1349-1351Google Scholar, 12Fricker L.D. Dalbey R.E. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes: Co- and Posttranslational Proteolysis of Proteins. 23. Academic Press, San Diego2002: 421-452Google Scholar). Likely substrates include precursors for neuroendocrine peptides, growth factors, and some growth factor receptors (13Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Google Scholar).As with many proteins that are localized to the TGN, the cytosolic tail region of CPD has been found to contain domains that affect the intracellular trafficking of this protein. These domains include two acidic clusters, a casein kinase-2 consensus sequence, a di-Leu motif, and a Phe-Xaa-Xaa-Leu sequence that may function as a Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-like element (14Eng F.J. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Google Scholar, 15Kalinina E. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 101-111Google Scholar). None of the previous studies on CPD has specifically examined sequences within the transmembrane domain, which is highly conserved among species. The 26 hydrophobic residues in this domain are identical in human, rat, and mouse CPD (Fig. 1). Duck CPD has only 4 amino acid differences in this 26-residue region, and all of these differences are conservative substitutions (such as Ser versus Thr or Ala, and Ile versus Val). The Drosophila CPD homolog also contains a hydrophobic segment of the same overall length. Interestingly, CPD from mammals, duck, and Drosophilacontains 3 Cys residues within the hydrophobic region, and except for 1 Cys residue in Drosophila CPD, all of these Cys residues are located within the cytosolic side of the transmembrane segment. This strong conservation of the Cys residues implies an important function.Cys residues located near transmembrane regions are often sites for the reversible attachment of the fatty acid palmitate (16Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Google Scholar, 17Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Google Scholar, 18Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Google Scholar). In many cases palmitoylation has been found to affect the intracellular localization and/or the rate of trafficking between subcellular compartments (16Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Google Scholar, 17Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Google Scholar, 18Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Google Scholar). For example, palmitoylation of the endopeptidase PC7 prolongs the half-life of the protein but not the localization to the TGN (19Van de Loo J.H.P. Teuchert M. Pauli I. Plets E. van de Ven W.J.M. Creemers J.W.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 827-833Google Scholar). In the present study, CPD was found to be palmitoylated in a variety of cell lines, and this palmitoylation required the presence of the 3 Cys residues within the hydrophobic region near the cytosolic domain. Potential functions of this modification were investigated by comparing reporter constructs that differed only in the presence of the 3 Cys residues. The finding that the absence of Cys residues prolongs the half-life of the protein, presumably by decreasing the rate at which the newly synthesized protein exits the Golgi, suggests a role for palmitoylation in the intracellular trafficking of CPD.RESULTSAtT-20 cells expressing construct 1 (the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of duck CPD attached to the C terminus of human albumin) were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid and then extracted and immunoprecipitated with an antiserum to human albumin. Gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography revealed a major band of ∼78 kDa, corresponding to the expected molecular mass of the construct (Fig. 3, left lane). No signal was detected when AtT-20 cells expressing construct 2 were similarly analyzed with an antiserum to albumin (not shown), suggesting that the presence of the CPD transmembrane region is required for this labeling. When wild-type AtT-20 cells were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid and immunoprecipitated with an antiserum that recognizes mammalian CPD, a faint band was detected around 180 kDa, corresponding to the molecular mass of CPD (Fig. 3,lane 2). Similar analysis of BRL3A (a rat liver cell line), NIH3T3 (a mouse fibroblast cell line), C57 (a mouse lymphoblast cell line), and NIT3 (a mouse pancreatic beta cell line) showed detectable signals in the 180-kDa range. The AtT-20, BRL3A, NIH3T3, and NIT3 cell lines are known to contain CPD although at different expression levels (3Xin X. Varlamov O. Day R. Dong W. Bridgett M.M. Leiter E.H. Fricker L.D.

When the various cell lines were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-CPD antiserum, the amount of CPD protein in each line generally correlated with the signal detected for palmitoylated CPD (data not shown), indicating that a comparable fraction of CPD is palmitoylated in each of these cell lines.Figure 3Palmitoylation of CPD in various wild-type cell lines and in AtT-20 cells expressing Alb-CPD tail (construct 1). Cells were incubated with [3H]palmitic acid for 5 h and solubilized, and Alb-tail or CPD proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation using an antiserum to human albumin (lane 1) or to CPD (lanes 2–6) and subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis and fluorography as described under “Materials and Methods.” The position and molecular masses of prestained markers (Invitrogen) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To explore whether the labeling of the albumin/CPD construct with [3H]palmitic acid requires the 3 Cys residues in the CPD region, two additional constructs were created in which 8 additional residues were added to the VSVG transmembrane portion of construct 2. These new constructs either contained the Cys residues as in CPD (construct 3) or had substitutions of Ala for these Cys residues (construct 4). AtT-20 cells expressing these two constructs were labeled with either [3H]palmitic acid or [35S]Met/Cys and immunoprecipitated with an antiserum to albumin. Both the cell line expressing construct 4 (A16) and the cell line expressing construct 3 (C21) showed equal levels of expression of the [35S]Met/Cys-labeled albumin/CPD construct (Fig.4, top). In contrast, only the cell line expressing construct 3 containing the Cys residues showed labeling with [3H]palmitic acid (Fig. 4,bottom left). Treatment of the gel with hydroxylamine reduced the amount of [3H]palmitic acid in the albumin/CPD band (Fig. 4, bottom right). The reduction in the signal with hydroxylamine is consistent with the palmitoylation of Cys residues and not Ser or Thr.Figure 4CPD is palmitoylated on Cys residues.AtT-20 cells stably expressing construct 3 (clone C21) or construct 4 (clone A16) were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys (A) or [3H]palmitic acid (B) and immunoprecipitated with an anti-albumin antiserum as described under “Materials and Methods.” Duplicate samples of the immunoprecipitates were separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. One gel was subsequently soaked overnight in 1 m Tris (pH 7.4) as a control, while the other gel was treated overnight with 1 m hydroxylamine (NH2OH, pH 7.4) followed by fluorography.

Although the overall localization of both constructs was generally similar in all six clonal lines, the Cys-containing construct 3 tended to show a more defined perinuclear localization, whereas the Ala-containing construct 4 showed a more diffuse distribution (Fig. 5). Double labeling of the cell lines with a monoclonal antibody to Syntaxin-6 showed that the major perinuclear staining of both constructs largely overlapped with this TGN marker (data not shown) as previously reported for endogenous CPD and other constructs containing the CPD transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail (14Eng F.J.

To determine whether this was the case for the albumin/CPD tail constructs, the ability of Triton X-100 to solubilize either construct 1 or 2 was examined. Both constructs were predominantly soluble in Triton X-100 (Fig.6), indicating that the presence or absence of the Cys-containing region had no impact on the lipid raft association of the constructs. Because CPD has been found to undergo multimerization (25Urban S. Kruse C. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5707-5715Google Scholar), which is presumably due to the luminal portion of CPD that is not present in the constructs used in the present study, the targeting of endogenous CPD to detergent-resistant membranes was investigated. NIT3 cells were chosen for this analysis based on the higher levels of endogenous palmitoylated CPD in this line compared with the AtT-20 cell line (Fig. 3). When labeled with either [35S]Met/Cys or with [3H]palmitic acid, the endogenous CPD was detected in the Triton X-100-extractable fraction and not in the detergent-resistant fraction (Fig.7, left panels). Caveolin-1, which is present in detergent-resistant membranes (26Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Google Scholar), was detected only in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 7,right panels). Thus, neither the albumin/CPD constructs nor endogenous palmitoylated CPD are detectable in the detergent-resistant fraction of the NIT3 cells.Figure 6Constructs 1 and 2 are not resistant to extraction with Triton X-100. AtT-20 cells stably expressing the palmitoylation-positive CPD transmembrane domain (CPD TM) (construct 1, left panel) or palmitoylation-negative VSVG transmembrane domain (VSVG TM) (construct 2, right panel) were solubilized with Triton X-100 at 4 °C and then separated by centrifugation into Triton X-100-soluble (S) and -insoluble (I) fractions.

Teuchert M. Pauli I. Plets E. van de Ven W.J.M. Creemers J.W.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 827-833Google Scholar). The three clonal cell lines expressing construct 3 and the three clonal cell lines expressing construct 4 were examined by pulse-chase analysis with [35S]Met/Cys. The Cys-containing construct 3 had a half-life of ∼5 h (Fig. 8), consistent with previous studies investigating similar constructs containing reporter proteins with the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of CPD (15Kalinina E. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 101-111Google Scholar). In contrast, the Ala-containing construct 4 was substantially more stable at every time point investigated with a half-life of ∼10 h (Fig. 8). To verify this result, a larger number of replicates was performed at the single time point of 4 h (Fig.8, inset). The Ala-containing construct was significantly more stable than the Cys-containing construct (p < 0.001 using Student's t test).Figure 8Pulse-chase analysis of cell lines expressing constructs 3 and 4. Three independent clones of AtT-20 cells stably expressing construct 3 and three clones expressing construct 4 were labeled for 15 min with [35S]Met/Cys and then chased for the indicated periods of time.

After incubation at 37 °C and centrifugation, the supernatant represents newly packaged material, whereas the pellet represents the material remaining in the Golgi/TGN. There is substantially less of the Ala-containing construct in newly packaged vesicles as compared with the Cys-containing construct (Fig.9). To control for general differences in the packaging efficiency of the two cell lines, we also examined the same samples for endogenous CPE. Although the A16 cell line packaged somewhat less of the CPE than the C21 cell line, this difference was a smaller percentage of the total amount packaged than the difference in the Alb-containing construct (Fig. 9). Taken together, these results indicate that the packaging efficiency of the Ala-containing construct into newly synthesized vesicles is reduced compared with the Cys-containing construct.Figure 9Packaging of constructs 3 and 4 into post-TGN secretory vesicles. The in vitro vesicle budding assay was performed using AtT-20 cells expressing construct 3 (clone C21) or construct 4 (clone A16). Permeabilized cells were incubated in the absence (−) or presence (+) of an energy-generating system. Following incubation, the samples were centrifuged to generate supernatants (containing nascent vesicles) and pellets (containing the TGN) and then subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody to human albumin or CPE (as control).

The length of this transmembrane region (26 residues) is longer than the typical 18 residues in a membrane-spanning α helix, and it is possible that the CPD sequence spans the lipid bilayer and then the extra residues fold back into the bilayer as suggested for other proteins (16Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Google Scholar, 27Hawtin S.R. Tobin A.B. Patel S. Wheatley M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38139-38146Google Scholar). If so, then the Cys-rich region would be contained within this folded-back region and not within the membrane-spanning α helical region. It is interesting that both the length of the hydrophobic segment and the number of Cys residues in this region (three) have been conserved from Drosophila to mammals. Additionally, a Caenorhabditis elegans gene encodes a protein with two carboxypeptidase-like domains followed by a transmembrane segment of 27 residues that contains 3 Cys residues. Although it has not yet been shown whether this C. elegansprotein is a CPD homolog, it is the only transmembrane-bound metallocarboxypeptidase in the genome, and so it is likely to represent the CPD homolog. Taken together, the high conservation of the Cys residues in the transmembrane segment of CPD and the finding that these Cys residues are palmitoylated implies an important function for this modification.The intracellular localization of a reporter construct lacking the CPD palmitoylation site was generally similar to that of the construct with the three Cys residues, although there was a subtle difference; the Cys-containing construct showed a more pronounced perinuclear distribution than the more diffuse localization of the Ala-containing construct. More quantitative analyses, such as the half-life and the rate of exit from the Golgi into vesicles, showed large differences between the two constructs. The findings that the Ala-containing construct has a longer half-life and slower rate of exit from the Golgi compared with the Cys-containing construct are consistent with each other and with previous studies that correlated turnover with Golgi exit (14Eng F.J. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Google Scholar, 15Kalinina E. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 101-111Google Scholar). CPD cycles between the Golgi and the cell surface via the constitutive secretory pathway and various endosomal compartments (5Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 877-885Google Scholar, 14Eng F.J. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Google Scholar, 15Kalinina E. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell.

During this trafficking, a portion of the CPD ends up in the lysosomes where it gets degraded. Deletions of the CPD cytosolic tail that increase the rate of exit from the Golgi and the subsequent amount of CPD in the secretory and endosomal pathways lead to increased degradation of the protein (14Eng F.J. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 35-46Google Scholar, 15Kalinina E. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 101-111Google Scholar). The current hypothesis is that the CPD tail has positive signals that are required for the efficient movement of CPD through this cycling pathway as well as retention signals that serve to anchor the protein within the TGN (15Kalinina E. Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 101-111Google Scholar). The present finding suggests that palmitoylation is one of the positive signals that increase the efficiency of trafficking of CPD throughout the secretory pathway.Because CPD and PC7 are in the same enzymatic pathway, it was anticipated that palmitoylation would affect both proteins in the same manner. Interestingly, the mutation of the palmitoylation site in PC7 reduces the stability of this protein (19Van de Loo J.H.P. Teuchert M. Pauli I. Plets E. van de Ven W.J.M. Creemers J.W.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 827-833Google Scholar), the opposite of the effect on CPD. Similarly, palmitoylation has been found to direct many but not all proteins into detergent-resistant membrane rafts (16Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Google Scholar, 17Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Google Scholar, 18Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Google Scholar, 29Melkonian K.A.

J. 1999; 340: 649-656Google Scholar) but does not appear to affect the Triton X-100 solubility of CPD constructs or of endogenous CPD at neutral pH. Previous studies have found that endogenous bovine pituitary CPD is largely resistant to solubilization with Triton X-100 at pH 5.5 (7Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25007-25013Google Scholar) but not at neutral pH values. 2E. V. Kalinina and L. D. Fricker, unpublished observation. It is possible that multimerization of CPD, which has been proposed to occur (25Urban S. Kruse C. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5707-5715Google Scholar), increases the net amount of palmitoyl groups per protein complex and enables the protein to enter detergent-resistant membrane rafts at low pH. Although pH dependence of the multimerization of CPD has not been tested, the related CPE is known to form aggregates at mildly acidic pH values and at millimolar Ca2+ levels (31Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that palmitoylation of full-length CPD present in multimeric complexes affects the interaction of the protein with lipids under physiological conditions in the secretory pathway. Multimerization is found for other palmitoylated proteins such as influenza hemagglutinin. When each of the subunits has three palmitoyl groups, the trimeric complex has a total of nine palmitoyl groups, and ∼30% enters detergent-resistant membrane rafts (29Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Google Scholar). However, when each subunit has only"

Carbohydrate epimerases are found in all living organisms and play crucial roles in numerous biochemical pathways as recently reviewed (1Allard S.T. Giraud M.F. Naismith J.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1650-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The ability of an organism to invert the stereochemistry at a specific chiral center of a carbohydrate can determine its potential to utilize a particular carbon source, form a functional cell wall, and/or act pathogenically toward a host (2He X.M. Liu H.-w. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 701-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because of the diverse nature of both the chemical composition of carbohydrates and their various metabolic roles, several different epimerization mechanisms have evolved. These mechanisms can be broadly classified into two categories: those that function on activated carbon centers lying adjacent to carbonyl, carboxylic acid, or ester functional groups, and those that epimerize unactivated carbon centers. Perhaps the best characterized member of the latter group, both kinetically and crystallographically, is UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (3Frey P.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 4Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This enzyme plays a key role in the Leloir pathway for galactose metabolism by interconverting UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose. The proposed catalytic mechanism of this epimerase involves several key features: 1) transfer of the hydride from C-4 of the sugar to NAD+ to form NADH and abstraction of the 4′-hydroxyl hydrogen of the sugar by an enzymatic base to yield a 4′-ketopyranose intermediate; 2) rotation of this intermediate by ∼180° about the phosphoryl-oxygen bond connecting the UDP and sugar moieties; and 3) transfer of the hydride from NADH back to the opposite face at C-4 of the keto-sugar intermediate and protonation of the resulting hydroxyl group. The enzymatic base in UDP-galactose 4-epimerase is thought to be a conserved tyrosine residue (4Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). UDP-galactose 4-epimerase belongs to a subclass of NAD(P)-dependent enzymes referred to as the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (5Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Members of this family contain a characteristic Tyr-XXX-Lys motif in which the conserved tyrosine is thought to play a key role in catalysis. Other proteins belonging to this subfamily include dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (6Allard S.T. Giraud M.F. Whitfield C. Graninger M. Messner P. Naismith J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (7Somoza J.R. Menon S. Schmidt H. Joseph-McCarthy D. Dessen A. Stahl M.L. Somers W.S. Sullivan F.X.

Alignments of the amino acid sequences for these enzymes with the Swiss-Prot data bank indicate that they share at least 20 and 40% sequence identity and similarity, respectively. On the basis of such amino acid sequence alignments another member of the superfamily has recently been identified, namely CDP-tyvelose 2-epimerase (10Hallis T.M. Liu H.-w. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 579-588Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CDP-tyvelose 2-epimerase, hereafter referred to simply as tyvelose epimerase, is involved in the synthesis of tyvelose, a 3,6-dideoxyhexose that occurs in the O-antigens of some types of Gram-negative bacteria (11Madigan M.T. Martinko J.M. Parker J. Biology of Microorganisms. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1996Google Scholar). Tyvelose is produced via a complex biochemical pathway that employs CDP-d-glucose as the starting ligand. The last step in the pathway, the conversion of CDP-d-paratose to CDP-d-tyvelose, is catalyzed by tyvelose epimerase as outlined in Scheme 1. Interestingly, tyvelose is found in the O-antigens of some pathogens such as Salmonella typhi and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IVA. In that tyvelose is the major immunological determinant in these bacteria, screening for the tyvelose epimerase gene via PCR amplification is being considered for earlier identification and treatment of S. typhi infections (12Hirose K.

Here we describe the cloning, purification, and high-resolution x-ray crystallographic analysis of tyvelose epimerase from S. typhi. Crystals amenable for a high-resolution x-ray investigation of the enzyme were grown in the presence of CDP. The enzyme is a homotetramer displaying 222 symmetry. Each subunit contains 339 amino acid residues and one tightly bound NAD+ moiety. The subunit is distinctly bilobal with an N-terminal region responsible for dinucleotide binding, a C-terminal motif important for CDP positioning, and an active site wedged between these two lobes. Side chain functional groups directly involved in NAD+ binding include Asp-32, Asp-58, Ser-123, and Lys-169 whereas Ser-194, Asn-126, Lys-127, Gln-235, Arg-237, Arg-299, and Asp-302 function in anchoring the CDP moiety into the active site. The x-ray analysis described here defines both the quaternary structure of tyvelose epimerase and its active site geometry, and confirms that the enzyme belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Cloning of the Tyvelose Epimerase Gene—The sequence of the tyvelose epimerase gene, tyv, from S. typhi has been reported and allowed for the design of primers for gene amplification from genomic DNA. Genomic DNA samples from S. typhi clinical isolates CDC numbers 87-2059 and CDC 88-2009 were generous gifts from Dr. Stanley Maloy at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. The tyvelose epimerase gene was PCR amplified from genomic DNA such that the forward primer 5′-CATGCCATGGCCAAGCTTTTAATTACCGGTGGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGTATAGAACTAGTCCATCATACATTTC-3′ added NcoI and XhoI cloning sites, respectively. To preserve the NcoI recognition sequence of CCATGG, the codon GCC (encoding alanine) was inserted before the second residue of the gene. The gene was PCR amplified with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and standard cycling conditions. The PCR product was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc.), followed by digestion with both NcoI and XhoI at 37 °C overnight. The gene was separated from digestion by-products on a 1.0% agarose gel, excised from the gel, and purified with QIAquick gel purification kit (Qiagen Inc.). The purified tyvelose epimerase gene was then ligated into the expression vector pET-28a (Novagen) that was previously cut with the same restriction enzymes. Escherichia coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and then plated onto LB media supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Individual colonies were selected, cultured overnight, and plasmid DNA was extracted with the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc.). Plasmids were tested for insertion of the tyv gene by digesting with NcoI and XhoI. Positive clones were sequenced with the ABI PrismTM Big Dye Primer Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) to confirm that no mutations were introduced during PCR amplification. Protein Expression—For protein expression, E. coli Rosetta-(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) cells were transformed with the pET28a-tyv plasmid and plated onto LB media supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. After ∼16 h, the plates were scraped and the cells were resuspended in LB media to use for the inoculation of 6× 2-liter baffled flasks containing 500 ml of LB plus 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration to an A600 of ∼0.4, at which time they were transferred to a 30 °C shaker for 30 min before inducing with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 6 h at 30 °C before harvesting by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 8 min. The cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Expression of the Selenomethionine-labeled Protein—E. coli Rosetta-(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) cells were transformed with the pET28a-tyv plasmid and plated onto LB media supplemented with kanamycin. Approximately 24 h later, several large colonies were selected to inoculate 500 ml of M9 minimal media supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol for growth overnight at 37 °C. Subsequently 10 ml of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 3× 2-liter baffled flasks containing 500 ml of M9 minimal media with 5 μg/ml thiamine, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.2. At that point, the temperature of the incubator was adjusted to 30 °C for the remainder of the growth. Cultures were grown to an A600 of ∼0.75, before each flask was supplemented with 50 mg each of l-lysine, l-threonine, and l-phenylalanine, and 25 mg each of l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine, and l-selenomethionine (13Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). After 20 additional minutes of growth, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow for 6 h. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 8 min, and the cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at –80 °C. Protein Purification—All protein purification steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. The cell paste was thawed in 100 ml of cold Ni-NTA 1The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HEPPS, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acid. lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole at pH 8.0. Cells were lysed on ice by four cycles of sonication (30 s) separated by 3 min of cooling. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 25 min at 20,000 × g. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a 10-ml Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen Inc.) column pre-equilibrated with Ni-NTA lysis buffer. After loading, the column was washed with about 60 ml of Ni-NTA wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), followed by gradient elution of the protein from 20 to 300 mm imidazole in Ni-NTA lysis buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE, and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPPS (pH 8.0) with 200 mm NaCl. The dialyzed protein was concentrated to ∼23 mg/ml, based on an extinction coefficient of ∼1.3 ml/(mg cm) as calculated by the program Protean (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI). Molecular Weight Determination—Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed by the University of Wisconsin, Madison Biochemistry Instrumentation Facility. Three samples of the purified native tyvelose epimerase at 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPPS (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl were provided for analysis. The experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-A centrifuge and an An 60-Ti rotor at 20 °C using 12-mm double sector charcoal-filled Epson centerpieces. Rotor speeds of 3,000, 7,600, 11,000, and 13,500 rpm were utilized while monitoring the radial position of the sample by absorption of light at 280 nm. The molecular weight from a global fit of 9 data sets containing 1246 points was 154,000 indicating that the quaternary structure of tyvelose epimerase is tetrameric. Crystallization of Native and Selenomethionine-labeled Tyvelose Epimerase—Prior to crystallization, the protein was diluted to 13 mg/ml with 20 mm HEPPS (pH 8.0), and 200 mm NaCl and CDP were added to a final concentration of 5 mm. Potential crystallization conditions were examined with a sparse matrix screen composed of 144 conditions at both room temperature and 4 °C via the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion. Single crystals were observed at room temperature at pH 5–6 with 10% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000. Refinement of the crystallization conditions led to large single crystals grown at room temperature with precipitant solutions of 4–6% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 250 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, and 100 mm succinate (pH 5.5). Crystals achieved typical dimensions of ∼0.5 × 0.3 × 0.15 mm in 2 to 3 weeks and belonged to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 47.9 Å, b = 167.3 Å, c = 89.4 Å, and β = 105.5°. The solvent content of the crystals was ∼50%, with one homotetramer in the asymmetric unit. High Resolution X-ray Data Collection—Both the native and selenomethionine-substituted protein crystals were flash-frozen in the same manner. Briefly, crystals were harvested from the hanging drop experiments and soaked for several hours to several days in a synthetic mother liquor composed of 10–12% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 200 mm NaCl, 300 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, 5 mm CDP, and 100 mm succinate (pH 5.5). These crystals were then transferred to 4% ethylene glycol, 14% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 325 mm NaCl, 300 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, 5 mm CDP, and 100 mm succinate (pH 5.5) for 30 s, followed by a final transfer to 15% ethylene glycol, 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 400 mm NaCl, 300 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, 5 mm CDP, and 100 mm succinate (pH 5.5). Subsequently, the crystals were flash-cooled to –150 °C in a stream of nitrogen gas. Frozen crystals were stored under liquid nitrogen until synchrotron beam time became available. X-ray data sets from both the native protein and the selenomethionine-substituted enzyme crystals were collected on a 3 × 3 tiled “SBC3” CCD detector at the Structural Biology Center 19-BM beamline (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). The x-ray data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab X-ray Structural Analyses—The structure of tyvelose epimerase was solved via multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing with x-ray data collected from the selenomethionine-substituted protein crystals. The software package SOLVE was utilized to determine and refine the positions of the selenium atoms (15Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Visual inspection of the selenium sites with the graphics program TURBO revealed four clusters of atoms related by non-crystallographic 222 symmetry (16Roussel A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 4: C66-C67Google Scholar). Subsequent non-crystallographic symmetry averaging and solvent flattening with the software package DM resulted in a readily interpretable electron density map calculated to 2.6-Å resolution (17Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The averaged map was used to build an initial model of one subunit of tyvelose epimerase, after which this subunit was rotated back into the unit cell to create the full tetramer. This tetramer served as a search model for molecular replacement with the program AMORE against the native x-ray data (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Alternate cycles of least-squares refinement with the software package tnt (19Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar) and manual model building reduced the R-factor to 17.9% for all measured x-ray data from 30- to 1.5-Å resolution. Relevant least-squares refinement statistics are summarized in Table II. A Ramachandran plot for all nonglycinyl main chain Φ,Ψ values is displayed in Fig. 1a. In each monomer there are two residues that lie outside of the allowed regions: Ser-163 and Thr-269. The electron density for these residues is unambiguous. Ser-163 is located at the beginning of the sixth α-helix in the N-terminal region whereas Thr-269 lies within a Type III turn delineated by Thr-269 to Asn-272. Neither one of these residues is directly involved in ligand binding. The electron density corresponding to the bound ligands, CDP and NAD+ in Subunit I is shown in Fig. 1b.Table IILeast squares refinement statisticsResolution limits (Å)30.0—1.50R-factor (overall) %aR-factor = (Σ|Fo — Fc|/Σ|Fo|) × 100, where Fo is the observed structure-factor amplitude and Fc is the calculated structure-factor amplitude./No. reflections17.9/22,5493R-factor (working) %/No. reflections17.8/20,3000R-factor (free) %/No. reflections22.9/22,493No. protein atomsbThis value includes multiple conformations for His-44, Ser-76, Val-84, Asn-126, Thr-145, Gln-158, Ile-182, Asn-186, Ser-247, Thr-314, Asn-315 in Subunit I; Ser-19, Val-271, Thr-294, Ser-337 in Subunit II; Lys-3, Thr-125, Gln-158, Thr-251, Leu-276, Thr-314 in Subunit III; and Ser-19, Lys-62, Gln-158, Thr-314, Lys-322 in Subunit IV.10,711No. Hetero-atoms1355Average B values (Å2)Protein atoms25.8NAD+17.4CDP31.1Solvents37.4Weighted root mean square deviations from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.012Bond angles (deg)2.23Trigonal planes (Å)0.005General planes (Å)0.010Torsional anglescThe torsional angles were not restrained during the refinement.

Open table in a new tab Quaternary Structure of Tyvelose Epimerase—On the basis of ultracentrifugation experiments and analysis of the crystalline packing arrangement, tyvelose epimerase is a homotetramer as shown in Fig. 2a. The enzyme has overall dimensions of ∼60 × 100 × 110 Å and displays 222 symmetry. It can be envisioned as a dimer of dimers with the A/B and C/D pairs mimicking the quaternary structural interactions observed in UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (20Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In both UDP-galactose 4-epimerase and the A/B or C/D dimers of tyvelose epimerase, there are two parallel α-helices contributed by each monomer that provide the structural framework for the subunit:subunit interface. In tyvelose epimerase, these α-helices are formed by Pro-93 to Gln-113 and Pro-164 to Phe-183. The buried surface area in this subunit: subunit interface is ∼2470 Å2, as calculated according to the method of Lee and Richards (21Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar) with a probe sphere of 1.4 Å. There are two additional regions per subunit (Asn-33 to Thr-40 and Glu-53 to Arg-67) that participate in monomer:monomer interactions along the A/C and B/D pairs. The polypeptide chain lying between Glu-53 to Arg-67 contains the third β-strand and the third α-helix of the Rossmann fold. The interfaces between the A/C and B/D pairs are not as extensive with buried surface areas of ∼ 1330 Å2. In the A/B and C/D subunit pairs, the adenine rings of the dinucleotides are separated by ∼27 Å whereas in the A/C and B/D pairs, these rings are positioned at ∼11 Å. Tertiary Structure of the Individual Subunit—The crystals employed in this investigation contained a complete tetramer in the asymmetric unit. The α-carbon traces for all of the monomers are virtually identical, however, such that they superimpose with root mean square deviations of 0.4 Å or less. For the sake of simplicity the following discussion will only refer to Subunit I of the coordinate file. As depicted in Fig. 2b, the overall molecular architecture of the tyvelose epimerase subunit can be envisioned as two lobes: the N-terminal region formed by Ala-2 to Gln-200 and Ala-242 to Gly-268 and the C-terminal motif delineated by Phe-201 to His-241 and Thr-269 to Ile-339. The N-terminal motif is dominated by a seven stranded parallel β-sheet defined by Ala-2 to Thr-7, Asp-27 to Asp-32, Glu-53 to Gly-57, Ser-76 to Leu-80, Asn-119 to Ser-123, Asn-186 to Tyr-196, and Ala-263 to Ile-266. There are two additional anti-parallel β-strands formed by Lys-136 to Glu-139 and Tyr-144 to Cys-146 and connected by a Type I turn (Thr-140 to Arg-143). These secondary structural elements of the N-terminal region are connected by a total of seven α-helices (Phe-12 to Ala-21, Thr-40 to Leu-49, Lys-62 to Tyr-72, Met-86 to Asp-91, Pro-93 to Gln-113, Pro-164 to Phe-183, and Ala-242 to Ala-254) and numerous reverse turns. The C-terminal motif is less complicated with three strands of mixed β-sheet (Val-236 to Leu-240, Ser-273 to Ser-275, and Arg-304 to Phe-306), two strands of parallel β-sheet (Phe-227 to Gly-231 and Thr-294 to Leu-296), and four major α-helices (Trp-208 to Glu-218, Leu-276 to Tyr-286, Lys-311 to Ala-316, and Ala-325 to Ile-339). The overall dimensions of the subunit are ∼50 × 50 × 50 Å. Binding Sites for NAD+and CDP—Shown in Fig. 3 is a close-up view of the active site for the tyvelose epimerase subunit. There are 15 well ordered water molecules located within 3.2 Å of the CDP or NAD+ moieties. The cytosine ring of CDP is hydrogen bonded to the protein via the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr-204 and the peptidic NH of Ser-230. An ordered water molecule is located at 2.9 Å from the amino group of the pyrimidine ring. A strikingly aromatic patch of residues, composed of Tyr-204, Trp-208, Trp-211, and Phe-212, surrounds one side of the cytosine ring. The CDP ribose adopts the C2′-endo conformation and its 3-hydroxyl group is anchored to the protein via the side chains of Asp-302 and Gln-235. Both Arg-237 and Arg-299, through their side chain guanidinium groups, are involved in electrostatic interactions with the α-phosphoryl oxygens. Additionally, Nϵ of Arg-237 lies within 3 Å of one of the β-phosphoryl oxygens. Asn-126 and Ser-194 form hydrogen bonding interactions with the other two β-phosphoryl oxygens. The β-phosphoryl group of CDP is situated at ∼5 Å from the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. The nicotinamide ring of the dinucleotide adopts the syn-conformation as typically observed for B-side specific dehydrogenases. Both riboses of the dinucleotide adopt C2′-endo conformations. The adenine ring of NAD+ forms hydrogen bonding interactions with the carboxylate group of Asp-58 and the backbone peptidic NH group of Ile-59. Asp-32 bridges the 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups of the adenine ribose. The ribose 2-hydroxyl group also lies within hydrogen bonding distance to the peptidic NH group of Arg-36. There are four water molecules located within 3.2 Å of the phosphoryl oxygens of the NAD+ ligand. Additionally, the peptidic NH groups of Phe-12 and Leu-13 form hydrogen bonds with OP2 and OP5 of the NAD+, respectively. These residues reside in the first α-helix of the Rossmann fold. The 3-hydroxyl group of the nicotinamide ribose lies with 3.2 Å of the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Leu-80, a water molecule, and Nζ of Lys-169. This interaction between Lys-169 and the dinucleotide is conserved among the members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. The 2-hydroxyl group of the nicotinamide ribose is positioned near a water molecule that, in turn, lies within 3 Å of the nicotinamide ring nitrogen. In the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, it has been postulated that Lys-169 activates Tyr-165 that is the ultimate base in the reaction mechanism. The distance between Lys-169 and Tyr-165 in tyvelose epimerase is 4.9 Å, a value that is comparable with that observed in other members of the superfamily. Interestingly, the distance between the nicotinamide ring nitrogen, which carries the positive charge in the oxidized form of the cofactor, and Oη of Tyr-165 is 4.3 Å. It is possible that the chemical role of Lys-169 is in proper dinucleotide positioning and not in activation of the conserved tyrosine residue. Regarding the carboxamide moiety of the nicotinamide ring, there is an intramolecular hydrogen bond between its nitrogen and OP4 of the phosphate backbone (2.9 Å). The carbonyl oxygen of the carboxamide group hydrogen bonds with a water molecule and the backbone peptidic NH group of Met-195. Comparison of Tyvelose Epimerase with UDP-galactose 4-Epimerase—Tyvelose epimerase is highly homologous to both UDP-galactose 4-epimerase from E. coli (27% identity and 43% similarity), and human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (23% identity and 41% similarity). In contrast to tyvelose epimerase, however, both the human and bacterial forms of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase are homodimers. Shown in Fig. 4a is a superposition of the polypeptide chain backbones for the human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase and the tyvelose epimerase subunits. There are only four major differences in conformations between these two enzymes as indicated by the letters A–D in Fig. 4a. For example, there is a 7-residue deletion in tyvelose epimerase, relative to UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, starting at Arg-36 and extending to His-56. This particular region is involved in the A/C and B/D interfaces in tyvelose epimerase and thus may be one factor for the differing quaternary states between these two proteins. There is a 16-residue insertion in tyvelose epimerase, defined by Leu-132 to Tyr-153, which forms two anti-parallel β-strands that are connected by a Type I turn (Thr-140 to Arg-143). Interestingly, this region in not involved in subunit:subunit contacts nor located near the NAD+ binding site. The functional significance of this insertion in tyvelose epimerase is unknown. The third region of difference occurs as a 6-residue deletion in tyvelose epimerase relative to UDP-galactose 4-epimerase from Gly-197 to Arg-199. This area is not located within the immediate vicinity of the NAD+ or CDP ligands. Finally, there is a 6-residue deletion in tyvelose epimerase from Gly-231 to Val-236, which corresponds to the region defined by Gly-227 to Val-238 in UDP galactose 4-epimerase. In both of these enzymes, this area of polypeptide chain is involved in binding the nucleotide portion of the substrate, either CDP or UDP, in tyvelose epimerase or UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, respectively. Indeed, while the positions of the NAD+ ligands in both enzymes are nearly identical, the locations of the CDP versus UDP moieties are somewhat different as can be seen in Fig. 4a. The α- and β-phosphorus atoms of the CDP versus UDP moieties are shifted by ∼2 Å. This shift may be a function of the need for the substrate, CDP-paratose, to position differently in the active site of tyvelose epimerase as compared with UDP-glucose (or UDP-galactose) in the active site of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase. Recall that in the reaction mechanism of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, the inversion of stereochemistry occurs about C-4 of the hexose rather than C-2 as in tyvelose epimerase. Also, paratose is a 3,6-dideoxysugar. Strikingly, in the model of the human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, the 2′-hydroxyl group of UDP-glucose is hydrogen bonded to Asn-207 whereas the 6′-hydroxyl group lies within 2.6 Å of Oδ1 of Asn-187. In tyvelose epimerase, these residues have been replaced by Gly-207 and Ser-194, respectively. Previous detailed mechanistic investigations of tyvelose epimerase from Y. pseudotuberculosis IVA have suggested that its catalytic mechanism may be reminiscent to that proposed for UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (22Hallis T.M. Zhao Z. Liu H.-W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 10493-10503Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by UDP-galactose epimerase is an epimerization about C-4 of UDP-glucose (or UDP-galactose) as indicated in Scheme 1. Extensive structural investigations in this laboratory have concluded that in the human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, Tyr-157 functions to initiate the reaction by abstracting the 4′-hydroxyl hydrogen from UDP-glucose (or UDP-galactose) with the concomitant transfer of the hydride at C-4 to the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. Additionally, Ser-132 in the human epimerase is thought to facilitate proton transfer from the sugar 4′-hydroxyl group to Oη of Tyr-157 possibly via a low barrier hydrogen bond (4Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Tyr-157 in human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase is conserved in tyvelose epimerase as Tyr-165 whereas Ser-132 in the human enzyme has been replaced with Thr-125. Both Tyr-165 and Thr-125 occupy similar positions within the active site of tyvelose epimerase as observed for Tyr-157 and Ser-132 in the UDP-galactose 4-epimerase active site region. Assuming that the reaction mechanisms are similar for these two epimerases as suggested by the mechanistic data, it is possible to speculate on the manner in which CDP-paratose or CDP-tyvelose might bind in the active site of the enzyme. Previous studies on the E. coli UDP-galactose 4-epimerase have demonstrated that the binding of the UDP moiety in the protein·NADH·UDP complex is virtually identical to that observed in the protein·NADH· UDP-glucose complex (20Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 23Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In light of this, a model of CDP-paratose was positioned into the tyvelose epimerase active site as indicated in Fig. 4b. This model was built by following the position of the CDP moiety as experimentally determined in this investigation and rotating the sugar portion to orient its C-2 near C-4 of the nicotinamide ring. In this model, C-2 of paratose is located at ∼3.7 Å of C-4 of NAD+ and its 2′-hydroxyl group is situated within ∼3.6 Å of Oη of Tyr-165. In the model presented in Fig. 4b, the 4′-hydroxyl group of CDP-paratose lies within hydrogen bonding distance to Thr-125 and possibly to Asn-126. For the model depicted in Fig. 4b, Asn-126 had to be rotated in the active site to avoid overlap with the paratose 4′-hydroxyl group. Indeed, in support of this idea of rotation, Asn-126 demonstrates multiple conformations in the high resolution structure of the protein·NAD+·CDP complex determined here. For the model of CDP-tyvelose presented in Fig. 4b, a series of rotations was made about the dihedral angles starting at the β-phosphorus atom. Accordingly, this model places C-2 of the tyvelose moiety within 3.4 Å of C-4 of the nicotinamide ring and its hydroxyl group within 2.8 Å of Oη of Tyr-165. The tyvelose 4′-hydroxyl group is now located within hydrogen bonding distance to Gln-206. In the models presented in Fig. 4b for the two sugar ligands, the positions of their β-phosphorus atoms differ by ∼1.0 Å. Support for this type of rotation in the active site is demonstrated by the high resolution structural analysis of the E. coli UDP-galactose 4-epimerase complexed with either UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose (24Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11469-11477Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In that study, significant changes were observed between the two bound substrates beginning at the β-phosphorus atoms where their positions differed relative to one another by 0.51 Å. The putative binding mode depicted in Fig. 4b can be tested by preparing and crystallizing abortive complexes of tyvelose epimerase with NADH and either CDP-paratose or CDP-tyvelose. These studies are presently underway. Regardless of the outcome of these investigations, it can be concluded that rotation of a 2′-ketopyranose intermediate in the active site of tyvelose epimerase must be different from that proposed for UDP-galactose 4-epimerase because of the difference in its regioselectivity. In UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, the putative 4′-ketopyranose intermediate displays a pseudo-C2 axis, which is not present in a 2-ketose intermediate. As such, a more complicated set of rotations about the phosphoryl backbone of the CDP-2′-ketopyranose intermediate must occur to present the opposite side of the oxidized sugar back to the reduced NADH for subsequent hydride transfer. We thank Professors W. W. Cleland and Frank M. Raushel for carefully reading this manuscript and Dr. James B. Thoden for helpful advice throughout the course of this investigation."

Transcriptional enhancer factor-4 (TEF-4) enhances the transcription of CTα in COS-7 cells by interactions with the basal transcription machinery (Sugimoto, H., Bakovic, M., Yamashita, S., and Vance, D.E. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276,12338–12344). To identify the most important transcription factor involved in basal CTα transcription, we made CTα promoter-deletion and -mutated constructs linked to a luciferase reporter and transfected them into COS-7 cells. The results indicate that an important site regulating basal CTα transcription is -53/-47 (GACTTCC), which is a putative consensus-binding site of Ets transcription factors (GGAA) in the opposite orientation. Gel shift analyses indicated the existence of a binding protein for -53/-47 (GACTTCC) in nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells. When anti-Ets-1 antibody was incubated with the probe in gel shift analyses, the intensity of the binding protein was decreased. The binding of endogenous Ets-1 to the promoter probe was increased when TEF-4 was expressed; however, the amount of Ets-1 detected by immunoblotting was unchanged. When cells were transfected with Ets-1 cDNA, the luciferase activity of CTα promoter constructs was greatly enhanced. Co-transfection experiments with Ets-1 and TEF-4 showed enhanced expression of reporter constructs as well as CTα mRNA. These results suggest that Ets-1 is an important transcriptional activator of the CTα gene and that Ets-1 activity is enhanced by TEF-4.

Zhang et al. (18Zhang D. Tang W. Yao P.M. Yang C. Xie B. Jackowski S. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35368-35376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showed that CTβ2 is induced in macrophages from CTα-deficient mice, and a low level of CTβ2 activity is apparently enough to keep the cells viable. In addition to post-translational regulation, CTα mRNA levels have been reported to be regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Tessner et al. (19Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided the first evidence for increased CT mRNA in colony stimulating factor 1-stimulated macrophages. Houweling et al. (20Houweling M. Tijburg L.B.M. Vaartjes W.J. Batenburg J.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. van Golde L.M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CTα is regulated at the level of its mRNA in rat liver after partial hepatectomy. The maximal increase in the CTα mRNA coincided with maximal DNA synthesis 24 h after partial hepatectomy (21Houweling M. Cui Z. Tessitore L. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CTα is highly expressed during the perinatal period, and the expression of CTα is positively associated with hepatic cell division (22Sesca E. Perletti G.P. Binasco V. Chiara M. Tessitore L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 229: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Cui Z. Shen Y.J. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).

Several reports indicate that CTα can be regulated post-transcriptionally, apparently by reduction in the rate of mRNA degradation (19Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hogan M. Kuliszewski M. Lee W. Post M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms involved in regulating CT mRNA stability still have to be elucidated. Tang et al. (26Tang W. Keesler G.A. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13146-13151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) isolated the murine CTα gene (Ctpct) and showed that the exon/intron organization of the gene closely resembles the functional domains of the enzyme. The gene is transcribed from two transcriptional start sites, lacks a TATA box, but contains GC-rich regions. The 5′-terminal, ∼200 bp of the proximal promoter, appears to contain Sp1, NF-κB, Ets, and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREBP)-binding sites as shown in Fig. 1. Bakovic et al. (27Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) characterized its regulatory elements and associated factors. Three Sp1-binding regions (-31/-9, -88/-50, and -148/-128) have basal, activator, and suppressor promoter activities, respectively. Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 can competitively bind to these regions, and the relative abundance of these factors regulates promoter activity of the CTα gene (28Bakovic M. Waite K. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently we have shown that transcriptional enhancer factor-4 (TEF-4) binds to the promoter region between -97 and -89 as shown in Fig. 1 and stimulates the expression of the CTα gene by association with the basal transcription machinery (29Sugimoto H. Bakovic M. Yamashita S. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12338-12344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TEF-4 is closely related to TEF-1 (30Yasunami M. Suzuki K.

Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Mallampalli et al. (34Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Carroll J.L. Osborne T.F. Thomas C.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 81-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported a functional sterol response element 156 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. Induction of CT mRNA was observed when Chinese hamster ovary cells and alveolar type II epithelial cells were cultured in lipoprotein-deficient serum, respectively. However, the physiological importance of this sterol response site in transcriptional regulation of the CTα gene is not clear (35Lagace T.A. Storey M.K. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14367-14374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that Ets-1 is a major transcription factor involved in the basal transcription of the CTα gene. Ets-1 was first reported as a proto-oncogene for avian erythroblastosis (36Nun M.F. Seeburg P.H. Moscovici C. Duesberg P.H. Nature. 1983; 306: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Materials—The luciferase vector, pGL3-basic, that contains the cDNA for Photinus pyraris luciferase, the control pRL-CMV vector that contains the cDNA for Renilla reniformis luciferase, and the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay system were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). FuGENE 6TM transfection reagents, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose), and fetal bovine serum were from Roche Applied Science, Sigma, and Invitrogen, respectively. COS-7 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of Deleted and Mutated CTα Promoter-Luciferase Reporters—Various 5′-deleted CTα promoter regions, LUC.C7 (-1268/+38), LUC.C8 (-201/+38), LUC.D1 (-90/+38), LUC.D2 (-130/+38), LUC.D3 (-52/+38), LUC.D4 (-10/+38), and LUC.D5 (+10/+38), inserted into the promoter-less luciferase vector pGL3-basic (Promega) were prepared as described previously (27Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). LUC.D3.25 (-43/+38), LUC.D3.5 (-31/+38), and LUC.D1.5 (-71/+38) clones were obtained from LUC.C8 by PCR using the corresponding forward primers, 5′-CAGGTACCCAGTCCGGTCAGATGTTTCCCG-3′, 5′-CAGGTACCCAGATGTTTCCCGGGCGTCTCC-3′, and 5′-CAGGTACCAGGGCGGGCGGGAGGCGGGACT-3′, respectively, and GL Primer 2 (Promega) as a universal reverse primer from the luciferase vector. The amplified fragments were purified, cut with KpnI/HindIII, and cloned into the corresponding site of the pGL3-basic vector. Fig. 1 shows the partial structure of the mouse Ctpct promoter from -212 to +38 and indicates the start positions of the deletion mutants. When we searched the CTα promoter region by TRANSFAC transcription factor data base, several important consensus elements for the binding of transcription factors were identified (Fig. 1). To prepare mutated promoters, GCCC (-139/-136) was mutated to AGCT and named LUC.mSp1 (1)/C7 or D1.5, CGGGCG (-67/-62) was changed to AATTCA and named LUC.mSp1 (2)/C7 or D1.5, GGCGG (-58/-54) was mutated to AACAA and named LUC.mNF-κB/C7 or D1.5, GACTTC (-53/-48) was converted to ACCAAA and named LUC.mEts-a/C7 or D1.5, TCC (-49/-47) was changed to AAA and named LUC.mEts-b/C7 or D1.5, and TGAC (+20/+23) was mutated to AAAA and named LUC.mCREB/C7 or D1.5. These mutations were created from LUC.C7 or LUC.D1.5 by PCR using QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated complementary primers were used for making each mutated construct, and the resulting plasmids were used for transformation of JM109 cells. The amplified plasmids were cut with KpnI/HindIII and cloned into the corresponding site of the pGL3-basic vector. All deleted and mutated constructs were sequenced and correct ones were selected for further experiments. Construction of TEF-4 and Ets-1 Expression Vectors—The mouse TEF-4 expression vector carrying the cDNA of TEF-4 was obtained by the yeast one-hybrid system as reported (29Sugimoto H. Bakovic M. Yamashita S. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12338-12344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The mouse full-length cDNA coding murine Ets-1 was obtained through PCR of a reverse-transcribed product of mRNA from NIH cells using Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with the complementary primers, 5′-GGCACCATGAAGGCGGCCGTCGATC-3′, and 5′-GTCAGCATCCGGCTTTACATCCAGC-3′ with Takara Ex TaqTM DNA polymerase (Takara-Bio. Co., Tokyo, Japan). The 1.4-kb PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5 (Invitrogen) in frame with V5-tag, and the sequence was confirmed. Tissue Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (1 × 105) were plated on 35-mm plates (Falcon-Becton Dickson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and grown overnight. Three μl of FuGENE 6TM was suspended in 100 μl of serum-free medium and mixed with 0.5 μg of the CTα promoter-luciferase constructs (see above), 0.001 μg of pRL-CMV Renilla vector as a transfection control, and 0.5 μg of either pcTEF-4 or pcDNA (Invitrogen). Transfection was initiated by dropwise addition of DNA suspension to the cell culture. Forty-eight hours later cells were harvested, lysed in 200 μl of Passive lysis buffer (Promega), and 10 μl of the cell lysate was used for the dual-luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by using the ratio of the activities obtained with the CTα promoter deletion constructs (see above) and the pRL-CMV construct carrying the cytomegalovirus promoter-luciferase fusion. When we assayed luciferase activities with Ets-1, pcDNA was used so that the plasmid content in each experiment was equal, and luciferase values were normalized against total protein concentrations determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electromobility Gel-shift Assays—Nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells were prepared according to Andrews and Faller (37Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (27Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Five hundred pmol of the opposite strands of pEts (5′-GGCGGGAGGCGGGACTTCCGGTCCGCAGTC-3′), pmEts-a (5′-GGCGGGAGGCGGaccaaaCGGTCCGCAGTC-3′), and pmEts-b (5′-GGCGGGAGGCGGGACTaaaGGTCCGCAGTC-3′) were annealed (70 °C, 10 min) in 100 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm NaCl and then cooled to room temperature. An aliquot (10 pmol) of the double-stranded oligonucleotides was 5′-end-labeled with [32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). A DNA protein-binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature in 40 μlof1× binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), 1 μl of the radiolabeled probe (50,000–80,000 cpm), and nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells. In some cases, unlabeled double-stranded pEts (100-fold molar excess), anti-Ets-1 or anti-Ets-1/Ets-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) was included in the incubation mixture. The labeled probe was separated from DNA-protein complexes by electrophoresis on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate/EDTA buffer (44.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.3, 44.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C until the xylene cyanol dye reached 5 cm from the bottom of the gel. Autoradiography was performed by exposure of the gel to an imaging plate for 15–30 min, and images were analyzed by Fuji BAS-2000 (Fiji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The intensity of the gel-shift band was calculated using the Quantity One software (PDI, Huntington Station, NY). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with 10% (w/v) gels, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences) with a semi-dry electroblotter (Sartorius, Goetingen, Germany). The membrane was treated with 5% (w/v) dried skim milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl at 4 °C overnight, washed, and then treated with anti-Ets-1/Ets-2, anti-Ets-1, or anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antiserum diluted 1:200 for 2 h, followed by washing with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by treatment for 30 min with protein A-peroxidase complex (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA), diluted 1:2,500, and the peroxidase immunostaining kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). RT-PCR—COS-7 cells (2.5 × 105) were transfected with pcDNA (1.25 μg), pcEts-1 (1.25 μg), pcTEF-4 (1.25 μg), or pcEts-1 and pcTEF-4 (1.25 μg each) in 60-mm plates as described above. pcDNA was used so that the plasmid content in each experiment was equal. After cells were cultured for 24 h, total mRNA was obtained with RNA extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed at 50 °C for 30 min, then subjected to 25 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) using the one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). The primers used for CTα were 5′-ATGCACAGTGTTCAGCCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGCTTACTAAAGTCAACTTCAA-3′ (antisense), and they produce an ∼200-bp CTα fragment. Primers for glycero-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (antisense). The intensities of the CTα bands were normalized to those of the G3PDH bands using the Quantity One software. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as means ± S.D. Group means were compared by Student's t test or Cochran-Cox test after analysis of variance to determine the significance of difference between the individual means. Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. Deletion and Mutation Analysis of Chimeric CTα Promoter-Luciferase Reporters and Their Activation by TEF-4 in COS-7 Cells—To examine the promoter region for CTα basal transcription, we prepared various CTα promoter deletion constructs linked to the luciferase reporter and transfected into COS-7 cells. The expression of luciferase activity was determined by dual-luciferase assays and normalized for transfection efficiency after co-transfection with pRL-CMV Renilla vector. The Renilla luciferase activity of the CMV promoter-driven controls was constant and was not affected by TEF-4 throughout the experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A, when cells were transfected with CTα promoter-luciferase constructs, luciferase activity was increased dependent on the length of the promoter region. The deletion analysis clearly demonstrated that constructs D3 (-52/+38) or shorter had minimal luciferase activity compared with D1.5 (-71/+38). These results suggested that important positive regulatory regions for basal CTα transcription in COS-7 cells resided between positions -52 and -71. To substantiate this proposal we made mutated constructs of LUC.C7 and LUC.D1.5 at each putative transcription factor binding site shown in Fig. 1. After transfection, the luciferase activities of the mutated LUC.C7 and LUC.D1.5 constructs were assayed (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). When the Sp1 site at -139 was mutated, the luciferase activity of the LUC.mSp1 (1)/C7 was decreased significantly, but only 25% compared with LUC.C7. When the Sp1 site at -67 was mutated, the luciferase activities of LUC.mSp1 (2)/C7 did not decrease compared with LUC.C7. The luciferase activity of the NF-κB site mutant (LUC.mNF-κB/C7) decreased by 25% compared with LUC.C7 (Fig. 2B). Mutation in the CREBP-binding site at +20 slightly decreased the luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). However, the luciferase activities of mutated constructs in the putative Ets-binding site (EBS), LUC.mEts-a/C7 and LUC.mEts-b/C7, were decreased by ∼80% compared with LUC.C7 activity as shown in Fig. 2B. The expression of the shorter constructs, LUC.mEts-a/D1.5 and LUC.mEts-b/D1.5, were very low, only ∼5% compared with LUC.D1.5 (Fig. 2C). These results strongly suggest that the promoter region between -53 and -47 is an important site for basal CTα transcription. We reported TEF-4 enhanced the luciferase activity of LUC.C7 and LUC.D1.5 about twice (Ref. 29Sugimoto H. Bakovic M. Yamashita S. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12338-12344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). When the mutations in EBS were created, co-transfection with TEF-4 cDNA also stimulated the activity of LUC.mEts-a/C7 or D1.5 and LUC.mEts-b/C7 or D1.5 about 2-fold. However, the TEF-4-enhanced luciferase activities with LUC.mEts-a/C7 or D1.5 and LUC.mEts-b/C7 or D1.5 were much smaller than LUC.C7 or LUC.C1.5. Thus, mutation of the Ets binding of the CTα promoter decreased luciferase activity to a low level (Fig. 2, A–C). DNA Binding Properties of the Nuclear Extracts of COS-7 Cells—To test whether or not there is a protein in the nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells that binds to the putative EBS (-49/-47), we prepared probes with or without a mutation in the EBS. As shown in Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3, DNA-protein complexes with the pEts (-65/-36) probe were clearly identified. When the EBS in pEts was mutated from GACTTC to ACCAAA (-53/-48) (pmEts-a) (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8) or from TCC to AAA (-49/-47) (pmEts-b) (Fig. 3A, lanes 10 and 11), the bands were attenuated or disappeared. These results strongly suggested that there was a protein(s) in the extracts of COS-7 cells that bound to EBS in the pEts probe. After transfection with pcTEF-4, the band intensities of the specific DNA-protein complexes were significantly increased (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3, and Fig. 3B). This result indicated that TEF-4 enhanced the binding of pEts probe and protein complexes to EBS. Identification of Ets-1 as the Protein That Binds to the pEts Probe—To identify the protein(s) binding to pEts, we used an antibody, anti-Ets-1/Ets-2, with specificity for the DNA-binding site in the C terminus of Ets family proteins. Immunoblot analysis indicated the existence of a 54-kDa protein that cross-reacted with anti-Ets-1/Ets-2 antibody in the nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells (Fig. 4A, upper panel). When various amounts of the anti-Ets-1/Ets-2 antibody were added to incubations of nuclear extracts with the pEts probe, the intensity of the immunoreactive band decreased (Fig. 4B, left). This result indicated that the bands revealed by the gel-shift analysis resulted from a complex of Ets-1 or Ets-2 with the pEts probe. To determine which member of the Ets family was binding to pEts, we used an Ets-1-specific antibody. Immunoblot analysis showed a 54-kDa protein that cross-reacted with anti-Ets-1 antibody in the nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells (Fig. 4A, middle panel). When we used the anti-Ets-1 antibody with the probe in gel shift analyses, the decrease in the intensity of the band was similar to anti-Ets-1/-2 (Fig. 4B, right). Thus, it appears that Ets-1 is the protein that binds to the EBS of pEts. When COS-7 cells were stimulated with TEF-4, the basal luciferase activities of LUC.C7 and LUC.D1.5 were increased (Fig. 2), and the binding of endogenous Ets-1 to pEts was significantly enhanced (Fig. 3, lane 3). However, immunoblot analysis showed that the amount of Ets-1, or actin as the internal standard, was not changed by TEF-4 stimulation (Fig. 4A). Thus, TEF-4 might modify the binding of Ets-1 to the promoter, and enhance Ets-1-stimulated CTα transcription. Over-expression of Ets-1 Increases the Binding of Ets to the CTα Promoter—In another approach to confirm that Ets does indeed bind to the CTα promoter, we transfected COS-7 cells with a vector that contained the cDNA encoding Ets-1 (pcEts-1) or the vector alone (pcDNA). Nuclear extracts were prepared after 48 h and i"

https://openalex.org/W1985805370,"The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fes is implicated in myeloid cells differentiation. It has been observed that its localization can be cytoplasmic, perinuclear, or nuclear. To further characterize this point, we studied Fes subcellular localization in myeloid cell lines (HL60 and K562) and in COS1 cells. Fes was observed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of HL60, K562 cells overexpressing Fes and only in the cytoplasm of COS1 cells, suggesting that nuclear localization is cell context dependent. Moreover, in myeloid cells, the treatment with differentiation-inducing agents such as retinoic acid, phorbol esters and vitamin D, is followed by an increase of the oligomeric form of Fes in the nucleus. In fact, oligomerization seems to be necessary for translocation to occur, since Fes mutants missing the coiled-coil domains are not able to form oligomers and fail to localize in the nucleus. The active form of Fes is tyrosine phosphorylated; however, phosphorylation is not required for Fes to localize in the nucleus, since tyrosine kinase inhibitors do not block the translocation process."
https://openalex.org/W2002871079,"Normal human keratinocytes possess a finite replicative lifespan. Most advanced squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), however, are immortal, a phenotype that is associated with p53 and INK4A dysfunction, high levels of telomerase and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at several genetic loci, suggestive of the dysfunction of other mortality genes. We show here that human chromosome 6 specifically reduces the proliferation or viability of a human SCC line, BICR31, possessing LOH across the chromosome. This was determined by an 88% reduction in colony yield (P<0.001), following the reintroduction of an intact normal chromosome 6 by monochromosome transfer. Deletion analysis of immortal segregants using polymorphic markers revealed the loss of a 2.9 Mbp interval, centred on marker D6S1045 at 6q14.3-q15, in 6/19 segregants. Crucially, allelic losses of this region were not identified in control hybrids constructed between chromosome 6 and the BICR6 SCC cell line that is heterozygous for chromosome 6 and which showed no reduction in colony formation relative to the control chromosome transfers. This indicates that the minimally deleted region at D6S1045 is not the result of fragile sites, a recombination hot spot, or a feature of the monochromosome transfer technique. LOH of D6S1045 was found in 2/9 immortal SCC lines and was part of a minimally deleted region of line BICR19. Furthermore, allelic imbalance, consistent with LOH, was detected in 3/17 advanced SCCs of the tongue. These results suggest the existence of a suppressor of SCC immortality and tumour development at chromosome 6q14.3-q15, which is important to a subset of human SCCs."
