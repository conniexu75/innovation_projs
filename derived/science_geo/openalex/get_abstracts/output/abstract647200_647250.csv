https://openalex.org/W3006500278,"Abstract Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this variation at the whole-genome scale 1–3 . Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4–5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter 4 ; identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural variation 5,6 ; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution 7 ; describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and promoter activity 8,9 ; and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of cancer genomes 8,10–18 ."
https://openalex.org/W3004584205,"Abstract A key mutational process in cancer is structural variation, in which rearrangements delete, amplify or reorder genomic segments that range in size from kilobases to whole chromosomes 1–7 . Here we develop methods to group, classify and describe somatic structural variants, using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumour types 8 . Sixteen signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution, assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are enriched in early-replicating regions—as are unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 2–7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and—in liver cancer—frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT . A wide variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which generate complex configurations of the genome upon which selection can act."
https://openalex.org/W3005469082,"Chromothripsis is a mutational phenomenon characterized by massive, clustered genomic rearrangements that occurs in cancer and other diseases. Recent studies in selected cancer types have suggested that chromothripsis may be more common than initially inferred from low-resolution copy-number data. Here, as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we analyze patterns of chromothripsis across 2,658 tumors from 38 cancer types using whole-genome sequencing data. We find that chromothripsis events are pervasive across cancers, with a frequency of more than 50% in several cancer types. Whereas canonical chromothripsis profiles display oscillations between two copy-number states, a considerable fraction of events involve multiple chromosomes and additional structural alterations. In addition to non-homologous end joining, we detect signatures of replication-associated processes and templated insertions. Chromothripsis contributes to oncogene amplification and to inactivation of genes such as mismatch-repair-related genes. These findings show that chromothripsis is a major process that drives genome evolution in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3005218670,"Abstract About half of all cancers have somatic integrations of retrotransposons. Here, to characterize their role in oncogenesis, we analyzed the patterns and mechanisms of somatic retrotransposition in 2,954 cancer genomes from 38 histological cancer subtypes within the framework of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project. We identified 19,166 somatically acquired retrotransposition events, which affected 35% of samples and spanned a range of event types. Long interspersed nuclear element (LINE-1; L1 hereafter) insertions emerged as the first most frequent type of somatic structural variation in esophageal adenocarcinoma, and the second most frequent in head-and-neck and colorectal cancers. Aberrant L1 integrations can delete megabase-scale regions of a chromosome, which sometimes leads to the removal of tumor-suppressor genes, and can induce complex translocations and large-scale duplications. Somatic retrotranspositions can also initiate breakage–fusion–bridge cycles, leading to high-level amplification of oncogenes. These observations illuminate a relevant role of 22 L1 retrotransposition in remodeling the cancer genome, with potential implications for the development of human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3005400930,"Here, as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, for which whole-genome and-for a subset-whole-transcriptome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumor types was aggregated, we systematically investigated potential viral pathogens using a consensus approach that integrated three independent pipelines. Viruses were detected in 382 genome and 68 transcriptome datasets. We found a high prevalence of known tumor-associated viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV; for example, HPV16 or HPV18). The study revealed significant exclusivity of HPV and driver mutations in head-and-neck cancer and the association of HPV with APOBEC mutational signatures, which suggests that impaired antiviral defense is a driving force in cervical, bladder and head-and-neck carcinoma. For HBV, HPV16, HPV18 and adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV2), viral integration was associated with local variations in genomic copy numbers. Integrations at the TERT promoter were associated with high telomerase expression evidently activating this tumor-driving process. High levels of endogenous retrovirus (ERV1) expression were linked to a worse survival outcome in patients with kidney cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3004462687,"Abstract Mitochondria are essential cellular organelles that play critical roles in cancer. Here, as part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium/The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium, which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumor types, we performed a multidimensional, integrated characterization of mitochondrial genomes and related RNA sequencing data. Our analysis presents the most definitive mutational landscape of mitochondrial genomes and identifies several hypermutated cases. Truncating mutations are markedly enriched in kidney, colorectal and thyroid cancers, suggesting oncogenic effects with the activation of signaling pathways. We find frequent somatic nuclear transfers of mitochondrial DNA, some of which disrupt therapeutic target genes. Mitochondrial copy number varies greatly within and across cancers and correlates with clinical variables. Co-expression analysis highlights the function of mitochondrial genes in oxidative phosphorylation, DNA repair and the cell cycle, and shows their connections with clinically actionable genes. Our study lays a foundation for translating mitochondrial biology into clinical applications."

https://openalex.org/W3004613412,"Abstract Chromatin is folded into successive layers to organize linear DNA. Genes within the same topologically associating domains (TADs) demonstrate similar expression and histone-modification profiles, and boundaries separating different domains have important roles in reinforcing the stability of these features. Indeed, domain disruptions in human cancers can lead to misregulation of gene expression. However, the frequency of domain disruptions in human cancers remains unclear. Here, as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumor types, we analyzed 288,457 somatic structural variations (SVs) to understand the distributions and effects of SVs across TADs. Notably, SVs can lead to the fusion of discrete TADs, and complex rearrangements markedly change chromatin folding maps in the cancer genomes. Notably, only 14% of the boundary deletions resulted in a change in expression in nearby genes of more than twofold."
https://openalex.org/W3004839449,"This report describes an R package, called the Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimator (iCARE) tool, that allows researchers to build and evaluate models for absolute risk and apply them to estimate an individual’s risk of developing disease during a specified time interval based on a set of user defined input parameters. An attractive feature of the software is that it gives users flexibility to update models rapidly based on new knowledge on risk factors and tailor models to different populations by specifying three input arguments: a model for relative risk, an age-specific disease incidence rate and the distribution of risk factors for the population of interest. The tool can handle missing information on risk factors for individuals for whom risks are to be predicted using a coherent approach where all estimates are derived from a single model after appropriate model averaging. The software allows single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be incorporated into the model using published odds ratios and allele frequencies. The validation component of the software implements the methods for evaluation of model calibration, discrimination and risk-stratification based on independent validation datasets. We provide an illustration of the utility of iCARE for building, validating and applying absolute risk models using breast cancer as an example."
https://openalex.org/W3005149865,"Successful implementation of the lean concept as a sustainable approach in the construction industry requires the identification of critical drivers in lean construction. Despite this significance, the number of in-depth studies toward understanding the considerable drivers of lean construction implementation is quite limited. There is also a shortage of methodologies for identifying key drivers. To address these challenges, this paper presents a list of all essential drivers within three aspects of sustainability (social, economic, and environmental) and proposes a novel methodology to rank the drivers and identify the key drivers for successful and sustainable lean construction implementation. In this regard, the entropy weighted Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was employed in this research. Subsequently, an empirical study was conducted within the Malaysian construction industry to demonstrate the proposed method. Moreover, sensitivity analysis and comparison with the existing method were engaged to validate the stability and accuracy of the achieved results. The significant results obtained in this study are as follows: presenting, verifying and ranking of 63 important drivers; identifying 22 key drivers; proposing an MCDM model of key drivers. The outcomes show that the proposed method in this study is an effective and accurate tool that could help managers make better decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3004796112,"Urban environments are unique because fragments of natural or semi-natural habitat are embedded within a potentially permeable matrix of human-dominated areas, creating increased landscape and, potentially, habitat heterogeneity. In addition, urban areas can provide diet subsidies for wildlife species in the form of fruiting ornamental plants, trash, and domestic animals. Ecological opportunity in the forms of habitat and food heterogeneity are thought to be important mechanisms in maintaining individual specialization. Identifying which contexts, traits, and mechanisms determine the success or failure of individuals within an urban wildlife population could potentially provide predictions about which populations may succeed in human-dominated landscapes and which may experience local extinction. We used both scat and stable isotope analysis of whiskers to investigate the degree to which coyotes (Canis latrans) utilized anthropogenic subsidies and exhibited individual diet specialization across the urban-rural gradient in southern California. Land use surrounding scat and isotope sample locations was also evaluated to determine the effect of land cover on diet. Human food constituted a significant portion of urban coyote diet (22% of scats, 38% of diet estimated by stable isotope analysis). Domestic cats (Felis catus) and ornamental fruit and seeds were also important items in urban coyote diets. Consumption of anthropogenic items decreased with decreasing urbanization. In suburban areas, seasonality influenced the frequency of occurrence of anthropogenic subsidies with increased consumption in the dry season. The amount of altered open space (areas such as golf courses, cemeteries, and landscaped parks) nearby had a negative effect on the consumption of anthropogenic items in both urban and suburban areas. Contrary to our hypothesis, urban coyotes displayed reduced between-individual variation compared to suburban and rural coyotes. It is possible that the core urban areas of cities are so densely developed and subsidized that wildlife inhabiting these areas actually have reduced ecological opportunity. Suburban animals had the broadest isotopic niches and maintained similar individual specialization to rural coyotes. Wildlife in suburban areas still have access to relatively undisturbed natural areas while being able to take advantage of anthropogenic subsidies in neighboring residential areas. Therefore, areas with intermediate urban development may be associated with increased ecological opportunity and specialization."

Columnar neurons in the fan-shaped body (FB) of the CX exhibit circular dynamics that multiplex information about turning behavior and heading.

Such a sense of heading is thought to be mediated by neurons that are specifically active when the animal is orienting toward the neuron’s preferred direction (Taube, 2007Taube J.S.

As with head direction cells in mammalian brains, columnar neurons encode heading as the identity of active neurons among the population. This heading representation can be updated by visual and self-motion cues via interactions between specific types of columnar neurons (Green et al., 2017Green J. Adachi A. Shah K.K. Hirokawa J.D.

Central complex neurons exhibit behaviorally gated responses to visual motion in Drosophila.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 111: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, the FB is well positioned to receive heading signals from columnar neurons in the EB and integrate them with other types of signals to guide navigation. However, it remains unclear whether and how neurons in the FB encode information about directional heading in behaving animals. Here we performed two-photon calcium imaging in the FB while flies were flying in visual virtual reality as well as in darkness. We found that specific types of columnar neurons in the FB show characteristic population dynamics that are prominent during flight but not in quiescence. These dynamics multiplexed information about ongoing turning behavior and heading direction. Activity of these FB neurons was coordinated with that of columnar neurons in the EB, which also encoded turning behavior and heading direction. Despite these similarities, columnar neurons in the FB and EB showed distinct activity in their branches in the noduli (NO), a subregion of the CX, where FB but not EB neurons flipped turn preference depending on the visual environment. Our results therefore suggest that the heading direction system of Drosophila is composed of columnar neuron networks spanning the EB and the FB, where heading and angular signals from the EB are combined with information about visual context in FB neurons. The FB can be divided into horizontal layers and vertical columns based on anatomy. Different layers and columns are innervated by specific sets of neurons, defining tens of cell types in the FB (Hanesch et al., 1989Hanesch U. Fischbach K.F. Heisenberg M.

To examine the activity of FB neurons in an unbiased manner, we first recorded from flies expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3656) Google Scholar), in all neurons. We performed two-photon calcium imaging in tethered, flying flies while presenting a bar stimulus (Figure 1A) whose location was updated according to the fly’s intended turns, estimated from the difference in the sound levels of the left and right wingbeat (Figures 1A and 1B; Shiozaki and Kazama, 2017Shiozaki H.M. Kazama H. Parallel encoding of recent visual experience and self-motion during navigation in Drosophila.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The FB was imaged at three horizontal planes targeting the dorsal, middle, and ventral layers (Figure 1C). The FB could be clearly delineated and separated from other regions of the brain (Figures 1C, S1A, and S1B). We found that the FB exhibited characteristic calcium dynamics. There was a bump of activity extending along the anterior-posterior extent of the FB that moved laterally over time (Figure 1D; Video S1). To quantify the spatiotemporal structure of this activity, we clustered image pixels using a K-means algorithm and found that the middle but not the dorsal or ventral region of the FB comprises approximately eight clusters (Figures 1E and S1C). Using the boundary of these clusters, we defined eight functional columns (Figure 1E) and examined the time course of mean fluorescent signals in each column (Figure 1F). This analysis revealed that the activity bump had a width of a few columns (Figure S1D) and moved at a timescale of seconds (Figure 1F). As a consequence, the activity of neighboring but not distant columns was correlated (Figures 1G and S1E). However, when the bump was at one of the lateral edges of the FB, the activity at the opposite edge also tended to be high (Figures 1F and 1G), indicating that, although the columns at the edges are physically distant, they exhibit correlated activity as in nearby columns. These results demonstrate that the FB contains columns forming a circular functional structure across which the activity bump moves laterally. Hereafter, we refer to these properties as “circular dynamics.” eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI4ZTI2NTRmN2RlNmYxMzQyNjJmZjg3OTBlZTUxZGQzMyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MzE2OTcyfQ.p7xnfDcoY245ggfvbvXZ4YAGDxjz1M-8M0HUIIqw6l9_lUAGT7D_3EsaRhSUJk936848TEU4SL7ZokOMmjpbGYtjQVB2Bu2wi7SQegBTEhogljF66BrpwF_wgOQogekp54wVb711qER8XV4AWxbcYH28cRYLez5uCzMWgk3zX1_o1Wg7NXbxUeJRRcs_DGGIFRGnli12U2x9c-JDJKYtmNxy8SXSTPvaKLNHRqzCe-Jez7MQpnNBxGqS9RpXTVE1LtOTMDXPo_yhwlXyPEPA0Fiv8ei1NiA342QqPHNLiHDpFTgIeAKx4hJXVMC1O9lJPZhALhTHpi9EQ7EfCvaPfQ Download .mp4 (5.35 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1.

Thus, the circular dynamics observed during the closed-loop flight might be driven by visual input. To examine this, we performed imaging while the fly was flying in darkness (Figure 1H). As in the flight with a bar, a bump of activity extending over several columns moved laterally over time (Figures 1I, 1J, and S1F; Video S2). Moreover, the left- and rightmost columns showed correlated activity (Figures 1J, 1K, and S1G). Thus, circular dynamics in the FB do not originate from visual input. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIxYjMyMzA1Y2UzNmMxZjNmZTM4Zjg5MDBmYjUxNDUxYyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MzE2OTcyfQ.TRk-mSA9fi6uDym_mTavxpyMYNiHILe4DBF_1K-_4e8UOJq19RFQn47_GGUgmoOf1CLL6l4y9gyxVVOiHoyv6WOgBDmwfYSN5Qg2Uc3DqUFn5OoA_NcwYD1CQxMn_8OsmEsGITCycpmymIm155s7l_2NL6Ddhx6MPK_auTUbxO2R9Xdg8gf9FHqRluQ_3CwZPBdO8-Q_lNJSKG62hLB9Xemsxcmp_e8TcKUUWISZOTVrBXDIS9IJpi0TRufYqio1pRnimr04163uvesGXVuAgERsoIPstJr_DhJLvkCKvio6LOEe6P7kLU-UEu5YREG6VDp3p83zgzalYGG9t9AFfQ Download .mp4 (5.36 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S2. Functional Columns in the FB Show Circular Dynamics during Flight in Darkness, Related to Figure 1Same as Video S1 but for the example trial of flight in darkness shown in Figures 1I–1K. These circular dynamics, observed across eight functional columns in pan-neuronal recordings, might originate from population activity of columnar neurons, sets of isomorphic cells that connect the FB, the PB, and another region, because individual columnar neurons have their neurites in one of the eight or 16 columns in the FB and tile the entire horizontal extent of the FB as a population (Hanesch et al., 1989Hanesch U.

Alternatively, other cell types, such as tangential neurons innervating all columns, might generate circular dynamics, with calcium modulation restricted to certain columns. To test these possibilities, we selected driver lines targeting subsets of FB neurons (Figures 2A, 2F, 2K, and S2E), and performed calcium imaging during flight in darkness. This functional screening identified multiple cell types that exhibit circular dynamics. One type was P-F-R neurons (PBG1-8.s-FBℓ3,4,5.s.b-ROB.b, labeled by R27G06 and R33A12; Figures 2A and S2E), which constitute a group of isomorphic neurons called the horizontal fiber system (Hanesch et al., 1989Hanesch U.

As in the case of pan-neuronal imaging, we found that P-F-R neurons showed a bump of activity extending over a few columns that move laterally and jump between edges (Figures 2C–2E, S2A, and S2B). One difference was that columns separated by about half the width of the FB showed negatively correlated rather than uncorrelated activity (Figures 2E and S2B). Another was a type of P-FN neurons (PBG2–9.s-FBℓ3.b-NO2D.b, labeled by R16D01; Figure 2F), which constitute the vertical fiber system (Hanesch et al., 1989Hanesch U. Fischbach K.F. Heisenberg M.

We quantified the strength of circular dynamics in each recording by calculating an index (circular dynamics index [CDI]) that considers two properties of circular dynamics: a positive correlation between the edges and a lower correlation between columns separated by half the width of the FB (Figure 2O). This analysis revealed that the strength of circular dynamics varied across cell types. For example, R27G06-positive P-F-R neurons and R16D01-positive P-FN neurons showed strong circular dynamics, whereas another type of P-FN neurons (PBG2–9.s-FBℓ3.b-NO2V.b, labeled by R37F06) and neurons that morphologically resemble tangential cells promoting sleep (labeled by R84C10) (Donlea et al., 2011Donlea J.M.

Intermediate values were observed for driver lines that label multiple layers of the FB, including the middle ones (R52G12 and R38E07; Figures S2E and S2F), or all neurons (Figure 2O), consistent with the idea that the signals obtained with these lines reflect combined activity of several cell types. These results demonstrate that circular dynamics are present in specific types of columnar neurons in the FB during flight. During the recordings, we noticed that spontaneous cessation of flight accompanied a strong reduction in calcium signals in the FB (Figure S3A), suggesting that the columnar neurons are active specifically during flight. To systematically test this, we imaged P-F-R neurons while controlling the timing of flight initiation and cessation with a puff of air and physical disturbance of wing movement, respectively (Figure 3A). Calcium signals were enhanced just after flight initiation and decreased over several seconds after flight cessation (see flight trials in Figures 3B–3D, S3B, and S3H). The enhancement was disproportional across columns, making the activity between the column housing the bump and distant columns more distinct during flight (Figures 3E, S3B–S3D, and S3H–S3J). The"

By combining early genetic alterations with disease-relevant exposures, we developed an integrative mouse model to study gastric premalignancy. Deletion of Trp53 in gastric cells confers a selective advantage and promotes the development of dysplasia in the setting of dietary carcinogens. Organoid derivation from dysplastic lesions facilitated genomic, transcriptional and functional evaluation of gastric premalignancy. Cell cycle regulators, most notably Cdkn2a, were upregulated by p53 inactivation in gastric premalignancy, serving as a barrier to disease progression. Co-deletion of Cdkn2a and Trp53 in dysplastic gastric organoids promoted cancer phenotypes but also induced replication stress, exposing a susceptibility to DNA damage response inhibitors. These findings demonstrate the utility of mouse models that integrate genomic alterations with relevant exposures and highlight the importance of gene-environment interactions in shaping the premalignant state."
https://openalex.org/W3004540020,"Solar heating of a cometary surface provides the energy necessary to sustain gaseous activity, through which dust is removed1,2. In this dynamical environment, both the coma3,4 and the nucleus5,6 evolve during the orbit, changing their physical and compositional properties. The environment around an active nucleus is populated by dust grains with complex and variegated shapes7, lifted and diffused by gases freed from the sublimation of surface ices8,9. The visible colour of dust particles is highly variable: carbonaceous organic material-rich grains10 appear red while magnesium silicate-rich11,12 and water-ice-rich13,14 grains appear blue, with some dependence on grain size distribution, viewing geometry, activity level and comet family type. We know that local colour changes are associated with grain size variations, such as in the bluer jets made of submicrometre grains on comet Hale–Bopp15 or in the fragmented grains in the coma16 of C/1999 S4 (LINEAR). Apart from grain size, composition also influences the coma’s colour response, because transparent volatiles can introduce a substantial blueing in scattered light, as observed in the dust particles ejected after the collision of the Deep Impact probe with comet 9P/Tempel 117. Here we report observations of two opposite seasonal colour cycles in the coma and on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through its perihelion passage18. Spectral analysis indicates an enrichment of submicrometre grains made of organic material and amorphous carbon in the coma, causing reddening during the passage. At the same time, the progressive removal of dust from the nucleus causes the exposure of more pristine and bluish icy layers on the surface. Far from the Sun, we find that the abundance of water ice on the nucleus is reduced owing to redeposition of dust and dehydration of the surface layer while the coma becomes less red. Spectral analysis of the VIRTIS dataset shows two opposite seasonal colour cycles in the coma and on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, indicating an orbital water-ice cycle."

https://openalex.org/W3004761768,"Abstract We previously demonstrated that loss of Cdk5 in breast cancer cells promotes ROS-mediated cell death by inducing mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening (Oncogene 37, 1788–1804). However, the molecular mechanism by which Cdk5 loss causes mPTP opening remains to be investigated. Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from Cdk5 −/− mouse embryos, we show that absence of Cdk5 causes a significant increase in both mPTP opening and mitochondrial Ca 2+ level. Analysis of subcellular fractions of MEFs demonstrates that Cdk5 localizes in the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (MAM) and Cdk5 loss in MAMs causes increased ER-mitochondria tethering, a process required for Ca 2+ transfer from the ER to the mitochondria. Loss of Cdk5 also causes increased ATP-mediated mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake from the ER. Inhibition of ER Ca 2+ release or mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake in Cdk5 −/− MEFs prevents mPTP opening, indicating that mPTP opening in Cdk5 −/− MEFs is due to increased Ca 2+ transfer from the ER to the mitochondria. Altogether, our findings suggest that Cdk5 in MAMs regulates mitochondrial Ca 2+ homeostasis that is disturbed upon Cdk5 loss, which leads to mPTP opening."

Methods We conducted a single center observational cohort study of 141 patients with severe acquired brain injury, consecutively admitted to an acute neurorehabilitation unit. We divided patients into three groups according to initial neurobehavioral diagnosis at admission using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and the Motor Behavior Tool (MBT): potential clinical CMD, [N = 105]; DOC [N = 19]; non-DOC [N = 17]). Functional and cognitive outcomes were assessed at admission and discharge using the Glasgow Outcome Scale, the Early Rehabilitation Barthel Index, the Disability Rating Scale, the Rancho Los Amigos Levels of Cognitive Functioning, the Functional Ambulation Classification Scale and the modified Rankin Scale. Confirmed recovery of conscious awareness was based on CRS-R criteria. Results CMD patients were significantly associated with better functional outcomes and potential for improvement than DOC. Furthermore, outcomes of CMD patients did not differ significantly from those of non-DOC. Using the CRS-R scale only; approximatively 30% of CMD patients did not recover consciousness at discharge. Interpretation Our findings support the fact that patients presenting with CMD condition constitute a separate category, with different potential for improvement and functional outcomes than patients suffering from DOC. This reinforces the need for CMD to be urgently recognized, as it may directly affect patient care, influencing life-or-death decisions."

Due to its endemicity, co-infection with malaria is common. The diseases cause anaemia and impaired nutritional status among children. We investigated the prevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis and its association with malaria, anaemia and nutritional status among school children. Methods This was a cross sectional survey among 830 children in Nyamikoma village along Lake Victoria in Tanzania. A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data, history of drug use, and clinical data. Two faecal samples were collected on two consecutive days and analyzed using thick smears Kato Katz method. Diagnosis of malaria was done by malaria rapid diagnostic test, and haemoglobin concentration was determined using HemoCue. Nutritional status was assessed by anthropometric measurements. Results The overall prevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis was 90.6% (95% CI = 88.6% - 92.6%). Intensity of infection was light 24.1% (200/830), moderate 38.4% (319/830) and heavy 28.1% (233/830). Pre-adolescents (≤12 years) were more infected with intestinal schistosomiasis (93.2%) than adolescents (>12 years) (84.7%) (p < 0.001). Prevalence of malaria was 1.7% (14/824), and that of intestinal schistosomiasis–malaria co-infection was 1.6% (13/824). The overall prevalence of anaemia was 24.6% (95%CI = 18.7% - 30.5%). Severe anaemia was found in 2.3% (19/824) of study participants. The prevalence of stunting and wasting were 29.0% and 11.3%, respectively. On both univariate and multivariate regression analysis, only lower age was significantly associated intestinal schistosomiasis infection, but not anemia, malaria, stunting or wasting. However among those infected, a negative binomial regression analysis indicated independent significant association of male sex, loose stool consistency, and stunting with high eggs count/gram of stool. Conclusions Despite several rounds of annual mass praziquantel administration, intestinal schistosomiasis is highly prevalent among school children particularly in younger children living in the study area. Biannual targeted mass praziquantel treatments or alternative regimens may be considered in future in the study area to redress the situation."

Understanding the molecular signaling crosstalk among the tumor cells, pDCs and immune cells will identify novel therapeutic approaches to enhance anti-MM immunity. Using oligonucleotide arrays, we found that pDC-MM interactions induce metabolic enzyme Alpha-Enolase (ENO1) in both pDCs and MM cells. Analysis of MM patient gene expression profiling database showed that ENO1 expression inversely correlates with overall survival. Protein expression analysis showed that ENO1 is expressed in pDC and MM cells; and importantly, that pDC-MM coculture further increases ENO1 expression in both MM cells and pDCs. Using our coculture models of patient autologous pDC-T-NK-MM cells, we examined whether targeting ENO1 can enhance anti-MM immunity. Biochemical inhibition of ENO1 with ENO1 inhibitor (ENO1i) activates pDCs, as well as increases pDC-induced MM-specific CD8+ CTL and NK cell activity against autologous tumor cells. Combination of ENO1i and anti-PD-L1 Ab or HDAC6i ACY-241 enhances autologous MM-specific CD8+ CTL activity. Our preclinical data therefore provide the basis for novel immune-based therapeutic approaches targeting ENO1, alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1 Ab or ACY241, to restore anti-MM immunity, enhance MM cytotoxicity, and improve patient outcome."

However, only 2.0% to 14.7% of girls and 9.5% to 34.1% of boys are meeting the current PA guidelines of 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA daily. Schools are targeted as a key setting to improve children’s PA levels. The Daily Mile (TDM), a teacher-led 15 minute PA intervention was established in 2012 and has been widely adopted globally. However, the dynamic school environment generates challenges for school-based interventions to follow a uniform implementation method resulting in sustainability issues and limited evaluation. The aims of this mixed-methods study were to (1) explore whether whole-school experiences of TDM were related to implementation and (2) examine the association between TDM and CRF in children from high and low socio-economic groups. Focus groups with pupils (n = 6) and interviews with teachers (n = 9) and headteachers (n = 2) were conducted to explore factors associated with successful implementation. Pupils (n = 258 imputed) aged 9–11 from six primary schools in south Wales, United Kingdom participated in CRF assessments (20m shuttle run test) at two time-points (baseline, 6 month follow-up). Thematic analyses of qualitative measures and linear regression analyses of quantitative measures were used to assess the research questions. Qualitative findings identified implementation factors associated with a positive experience of TDM; flexible and adaptable, not replacing current play provision but delivered as an additional playtime, incorporate personal goal setting, teacher participation, whole-school delivery with community support. Both groups demonstrated equal increases in shuttles between baseline and follow-up (deprived: 4.7 ± 13.4, non-deprived: 4.8 ± 16.0). There was no significant difference in this increase for deprived compared to non-deprived children adjusted for age and gender. Findings from this study provide a set of recommendations for the future implementation and sustainability of TDM."
https://openalex.org/W3005136163,"Introduction The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) started a routine rotavirus immunization program with ROTARIX in May 2016, with support for vaccine procurement and introduction provided through a global development organization. In 2018, financial responsibility for rotavirus vaccine procurement was transferred to the Palestinian government, which elected to shift to ROTAVAC vaccine because of its lower price per dose. This study aims to assess the cost, impact, and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination, specifically evaluating the economic implications of the change in vaccine product, accounting for the different characteristics of each rotavirus vaccine used. Methods We conducted primary and secondary data collection to assess the introduction, procurement, supply chain, and service delivery costs related to each vaccine. We used the UNIVAC model to project costs and benefits of rotavirus vaccination over a 10-year period comparing the use of ROTARIX versus no vaccination; ROTAVAC versus no vaccination; and ROTAVAC versus ROTARIX. We undertook scenario and probabilistic analyses to capture uncertainty in some of the study parameters. We used a 3% discount rate, and all costs are in 2018 US$. Results The cost to deliver one dose was lower for ROTAVAC than ROTARIX (US$2.36 versus $2.70), but the total cost per course, excluding vaccine cost, favored ROTARIX ($7.09 versus $5.39). Both vaccines had high probability of being cost-effective interventions in Palestine compared to no vaccine. Because of lower vaccination program costs for ROTAVAC, however, switching from ROTARIX to ROTAVAC was cost-saving. Conclusion National decision-makers should consider systematically assessing multiple criteria beyond vaccine price when comparing the health and economic value of several products in order to fully account for all characteristics including product presentation, number of doses per course, cold chain volume, cost of delivery, and wastage."
https://openalex.org/W3005033990,"One of the main challenges in increasing the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutics is the fact that they do not reach cancerous cells at a sufficiently high dosage. In order to remedy this deficiency, nanoparticle-based drugs have evolved as a promising novel approach to more specific tumour targeting. Nevertheless, several biophysical phenomena prevent the sufficient penetration of nanoparticles in order to target the entire tumour. We therefore extend our vascular multiphase tumour growth model, enabling it to investigate the influence of different biophysical factors on the distribution of nanoparticles in the tumour microenvironment. The novel model permits the examination of the interplay between the size of vessel-wall pores, the permeability of the blood-vessel endothelium and the lymphatic drainage on the delivery of particles of different sizes. Solid tumours develop a non-perfused core and increased interstitial pressure. Our model confirms that those two typical features of solid tumours limit nanoparticle delivery. Only in case of small nanoparticles is the transport dominated by diffusion, and particles can reach the entire tumour. The size of the vessel-wall pores and the permeability of the blood-vessel endothelium have a major impact on the amount of delivered nanoparticles. This extended in-silico tumour growth model permits the examination of the characteristics and of the limitations of nanoparticle delivery to solid tumours, which currently complicate the translation of nanoparticle therapy to a clinical stage."
https://openalex.org/W3005514019,"In natural-language processing, the subject-action-object (SAO) structure is used to convert unstructured textual data into structured textual data comprising subjects, actions, and objects. This structure is suitable for analyzing the key elements of technology, as well as the relationships between these elements. However, analysis using the existing SAO structure requires a substantial number of manual processes because this structure does not represent the context of the sentences. Thus, we introduce the concept of SAO2Vec, in which SAO is used to embed the vectors of sentences and documents, for use in text mining in the analysis of technical documents. First, the technical documents of interest are collected, and SAO structures are extracted from them. Then, sentence vectors are extracted through the Doc2Vec algorithm and are updated using word vectors in the SAO structure. Finally, SAO vectors are drawn using an updated sentence vector with the same SAO structure. In addition, document vectors are derived from the document's SAO vectors. The results of an experiment in the Internet of things field indicate that the SAO2Vec method produces 3.1% better accuracy than the Doc2Vec method and 115.0% better accuracy than SAO frequency alone.

In EGFR (HER1) and EGFR2 (HER2) signaling, SHP2 increases the half-life of activated Ras by blocking recruitment of Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) to the plasma membrane through dephosphorylation of docking sites on the receptors. However, it is unclear how SHP2 selectively recognizes RasGAP-binding sites on EGFR and HER2. In this report, we show that SHP2-targeted pTyr residues exist in a specific amino acid context that allows selective binding. More specifically, we show that acidic residues N-terminal to the substrate pTyr in EGFR and HER2 mediate specific binding by the SHP2 active site, leading to blockade of RasGAP binding and optimal signaling by the two receptors. Molecular modeling studies revealed that a peptide derived from the region of pTyr992-EGFR packs well and makes stronger interactions with the SHP2 active site than with the SHP1 active site, suggesting a built-in mechanism that enables selective substrate recognition by SHP2. A phosphorylated form of this peptide inhibits SHP2 activity in vitro and EGFR and HER2 signaling in cells, suggesting inhibition of SHP2 protein tyrosine phosphatase activity by this peptide. Although we do not expect this peptide to be a strong inhibitor by itself, we foresee that the insights into SHP2 selectivity described here will be useful in future development of active-site small molecule-based inhibitors.

To evaluate the impact on patient outcomes before and after the implementation, patients were divided into two groups: before (April 2014 to March 2017; 1988 patients) and after (April 2017 to March 2019; 1664 patients). Patients' demographic data were collected from the ICU database.Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of a CNS as ICU head nurse was associated with lower ICU mortality (odds ratio (OR): 0.52, 95% CI: 0.36-0.73, p < .001) and fewer patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU (OR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.15-0.26, p < .001).CNSs are defined as one type of advanced practice nurses. Having a CNS as a head nurse in the ICU may have helped improve patient outcomes by leveraging these practical skills in nursing management."

However, the epigenetic mechanism regulating the expression of CB1Rs in neuropathic pain is unknown. G9a (encoded by the Ehmt2 gene), a histone 3 at lysine 9 methyltransferase, is a key chromatin regulator responsible for gene silencing. In this study, we determined G9a's role in regulating CB1R expression in the DRG and in CB1R-mediated analgesic effects in an animal model of neuropathic pain. We show that nerve injury profoundly reduced mRNA levels of CB1Rs but increased the expression of CB2 receptors in the rat DRG. ChIP results indicated increased enrichment of histone 3 at lysine 9 dimethylation, a G9a-catalyzed repressive histone mark, at the promoter regions of the CB1R genes. G9a inhibition in nerve-injured rats not only up-regulated the CB1R expression level in the DRG but also potentiated the analgesic effect of a CB1R agonist on nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, in mice lacking Ehmt2 in DRG neurons, nerve injury failed to reduce CB1R expression in the DRG and to decrease the analgesic effect of the CB1R agonist. Moreover, nerve injury diminished the inhibitory effect of the CB1R agonist on synaptic glutamate release from primary afferent nerves to spinal cord dorsal horn neurons in WT mice but not in mice lacking Ehmt2 in DRG neurons.

G9a is present in the nucleus of DRG neurons, and traumatic nerve injury increases the expression level and activity of G9a in the DRG (17Laumet G. Garriga J. Chen S.R. Zhang Y. Li D.P. Smith T.M.

However, it is not known whether G9a plays a role in epigenetic regulation of CB1Rs in DRG neurons in neuropathic pain. In this study, we determined the expression level of CB1Rs in the DRG after nerve injury and the role of G9a in epigenetic silencing of CB1R expression in neuropathic pain. Our study reveals that nerve injury induces a long-lasting reduction in the expression level of CB1Rs in the DRG and that G9a is critically involved in down-regulation of CB1Rs in injured DRGs and in the diminished analgesic effect of CB1R agonists on neuropathic pain. This new information is important for our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms regulating CB1R expression in primary sensory neurons and for the design of better strategies to improve CB1R-mediated cannabinoid analgesic effects on neuropathic pain. Quantitative PCR assay showed that the mRNA level of CB1Rs in the DRG was much lower in spinal nerve ligation (SNL) rats than in sham control rats 5, 10, and 21 days after surgery (p < 0.001, n = 6 rats/group; Fig. 1A). However, SNL had no significant effect on the mRNA level of CB1Rs in the dorsal spinal cord 3 weeks after surgery (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the mRNA level of CB2Rs in the DRG was significantly increased in SNL rats compared with control rats on days 10 and 21, but not on day 5, after surgery (p < 0.001, n = 6 rats/group; Fig. 1C). In addition, SNL significantly increased the mRNA level of CB2Rs in the dorsal spinal cord 3 weeks after surgery (p = 0.0126, n = 6 rats/group; Fig. 1D). These results indicate that peripheral nerve injury induces sustained down-regulation of CB1Rs but increases CB2R expression in the DRG. The persistent silencing of CB1R expression in the DRG after nerve injury suggests involvement of an epigenetic mechanism. We have shown previously that SNL increases the expression and activity of G9a in the DRG (17Laumet G. Garriga J. Chen S.R. Zhang Y. Li D.P. Smith T.M. Dong Y. Jelinek J. Cesaroni M. Issa J.P. Pan H.L. G9a is essential for epigenetic silencing of K+ channel genes in acute-to-chronic pain transition.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 (26551542): 1746-175510.1038/nn.4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The G9a-mediated histone modification H3K9me2 is a major repressive histone mark commonly involved in gene silencing in the DRG (17Laumet G. Garriga J. Chen S.R. Zhang Y. Li D.P. Smith T.M. Dong Y. Jelinek J. Cesaroni M. Issa J.P. Pan H.L. G9a is essential for epigenetic silencing of K+ channel genes in acute-to-chronic pain transition.Nat.

Academic Press, London, United Kingdom2018: 85-98Google Scholar). We next used ChIP-PCR to measure the occupancy of H3K9me2 at the CB1R promoter after SNL. SNL substantially increased the H3K9me2 level at the transcriptional start site (−60/95 bp) of CB1Rs in the DRG 3 weeks after surgery (p = 0.0152, Fig. 2). Furthermore, enrichment of H3K9me2 levels in two other regions, −480/−360 bp (p = 0.0022) and 363/469 bp (p = 0.0043), in the promoter region of CB1Rs in the DRG was also significantly higher in SNL rats than in control rats (Fig. 2). These data suggest that G9a-mediated H3K9me2 is associated with nerve injury–induced CB1R down-regulation in the DRG. We next determined whether increased G9a activity contributes to nerve injury–induced down-regulation of CB1Rs in the DRG. We treated SNL rats with daily intrathecal injections of 10 μg of UNC0638 or DMSO (as the vehicle control) for 7 days. The efficacy of intrathecal UNC0638, a highly specific G9a inhibitor, has been confirmed in our previous study (17Laumet G. Garriga J. Chen S.R. Zhang Y. Li D.P. Smith T.M. Dong Y. Jelinek J. Cesaroni M. Issa J.P. Pan H.L. G9a is essential for epigenetic silencing of K+ channel genes in acute-to-chronic pain transition.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 (26551542): 1746-175510.1038/nn.4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Treatment with UNC0638 largely restored the mRNA level of CB1Rs in the injured L5 and L6 DRGs (n = 8 rats/group, Fig. 3A). However, treatment with UNC0638 had no effect on the mRNA level of CB1Rs in the spinal cord (n = 6 rats/group, Fig. 3B). Also, the mRNA level of CB1Rs in the DRG did not differ significantly between sham rats treated with vehicle and sham rats treated with UNC0638 (n = 8 rats/group, Fig. 3A). We used immunoblotting and DRG tissues from CB1R conditional knockout mice (generated by crossing female Cnr1flox/flox mice with male AdvillinCre/+ mice) as stringent controls to validate three CB1R antibodies commonly used in the literature, including those from Alomone Labs, Cayman Chemical, and Frontier Institute Co. (see supporting information). However, we were unable to validate the specificity of these three antibodies because they detected similar protein bands in the DRG tissues from WT and CB1R conditional knockout mice (supporting information). For this reason, we did not include our immunoblot data for CB1R protein quantification. We then determined whether the analgesic effect of the CB1R agonist was altered in SNL rats and whether such a change was due to augmented G9a activity. We measured the effect of ACEA, a specific CB1R agonist (23Hillard C.J. Manna S. Greenberg M.J. DiCamelli R. Ross R.A. Stevenson L.A. Murphy V. Pertwee R.G. Campbell W.B.

In contrast, the inhibitory effects of ACEA injected intrathecally on allodynia and hyperalgesia were significantly potentiated in UNC0638-treated SNL rats (n = 10 rats/group, Fig. 4). Treatment with UNC0638 also significantly increased the baseline tactile and pressure withdrawal thresholds of SNL rats, as we reported previously (17Laumet G. Garriga J. Chen S.R. Zhang Y. Li D.P.

In WT mice, SNI significantly reduced the mRNA level of CB1Rs in the DRG (p < 0.001, n = 6 mice/group, Fig. 5). In contrast, in Ehmt2-cKO mice, SNI had no significant effect on the mRNA level of CB1Rs in the DRG (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the mRNA level of CB1Rs in the DRG did not differ significantly between sham-treated WT mice and sham-treated Ehmt2-cKO mice (Fig. 5). SNI substantially decreased the withdrawal thresholds of the ipsilateral hind paw in response to application of von Frey filaments and noxious pressure and heat stimuli, indicating pain hypersensitivity, in seven WT control mice 3 weeks after surgery (Fig. 6). The tactile (0.84 ± 0.06 versus 0.82 ± 0.04 g, t = 0.21, p = 0.85) and pressure (78.08 ± 4.25 versus 77.02 ± 5.04 g, t = 1.72, p = 0.13) withdrawal thresholds did not differ significantly between the SNI and sham control mice 3 weeks after surgery (n = 8 mice/group), similar to what we reported previously for Ehmt2-cKO mice (17Laumet G.

In WT mice subjected to SNI, intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg of the CB1R agonist ACEA had no significant effect on the mechanical and thermal withdrawal thresholds (n = 7 mice, Fig. 6). In contrast, intraperitoneal injection of ACEA at both 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg significantly increased the mechanical and thermal withdrawal thresholds in Ehmt2-cKO mice 3 weeks after SNI (n = 8 mice, Fig. 6). These data provide unambiguous evidence that G9a in DRG neurons is indispensable for nerve injury–induced down-regulation of CB1Rs and the diminished analgesic effect of the CB1R agonist on neuropathic pain. CB1Rs are expressed presynaptically at primary afferent nerve terminals, and CB1R activation can reduce nociceptive input to the spinal cord (9Salio C. Fischer J. Franzoni M.F. Conrath M.

In the spinal cord, the mixed CB1R/CB2R agonist WIN55,212-2 reduces synaptic transmission, and this effect is blocked by the CB1R antagonist SR141716A (26Morisset V. Urban L.

We thus used Ehmt2-cKO mice to determine whether G9a in DRG neurons influences the inhibitory effect of the CB1R agonist on glutamatergic input from primary afferent nerves to spinal dorsal horn neurons in neuropathic pain. In WT mice receiving sham surgery, bath application of 50–200 nm but not 10–20 nm ACEA significantly reduced the amplitude of monosynaptically evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) of spinal lamina II neurons (n = 12 neurons, Fig. 7, A and B). SNI markedly increased the baseline amplitude of EPSCs of lamina II neurons monosynaptically evoked from dorsal root stimulation, in agreement with our previous reports (27Chen J. Li L. Chen S.R.

Strikingly, in WT mice subjected to SNI, bath application of up to 200 nm ACEA had no significant inhibitory effect on the amplitude of evoked EPSCs of spinal dorsal horn neurons (n = 11 neurons, Fig. 7, A and B). In contrast, in Ehmt2-cKO mice subjected to SNI and sham surgery, bath application of 50–200 nm ACEA similarly attenuated the amplitude of monosynaptically evoked EPSCs of lamina II neurons (Fig. 7, A and C). The inhibitory effect of ACEA on the amplitude of evoked EPSCs in lamina II neurons did not differ significantly between SNI Ehmt2-cKO mice (n = 12 neurons) and sham-treated Ehmt2-cKO mice (n = 10 neurons). These findings clearly indicate that G9a in DRG neurons is responsible for nerve injury–induced reduction in CB1R-mediated inhibition of primary afferent input to spinal dorsal horn neurons. Our study demonstrates that nerve injury induced long-lasting CB1R down-regulation in the DRG and diminished the analgesic effect of the CB1R agonist on neuropathic pain. We found that, in both rats and mice, nerve injury caused by SNL and SNI, respectively, consistently reduced the expression of CB1Rs in the DRG. Our quantitative PCR results are consistent with unbiased RNA-Seq data showing that CB1R expression is significantly reduced in the DRG after nerve injury (17Laumet G. Garriga J. Chen S.R. Zhang Y. Li D.P. Smith T.M. Dong Y. Jelinek J. Cesaroni M. Issa J.P. Pan H.L. G9a is essential for epigenetic silencing of K+ channel genes in acute-to-chronic pain transition.Nat.

A previous study, using only three rats per group, reported that L5 SNL did not alter the mRNA level of CB1Rs in the injured DRG but did reduce the percentage of CB1R/IB4 and CB1R/CGRP double-labeled DRG neurons (29Mitrirattanakul S.

However, little is known presently about the characteristics of off-prescription cognitive enhancing drug users or their perceived everyday experience with these drugs. As modafinil is the most commonly used off-prescription cognitive enhancing drug, the current study aimed to provide a detailed profile of modafinil users and their experiences and perceptions of this drug. To this end, an online survey, targeting cognitive enhancing drug users and students, was advertised on forum sites. Information was obtained regarding demographic data, illicit drug use, psychiatric diagnosis and experience of modafinil. Of the 404 respondents, 219 reported taking modafinil. Of these the majority were male, American or British, university-educated and currently employed, with a mean age of 27. Overall, modafinil was perceived by users as being safe. Modafinil users reported higher levels of illicit drug use and psychiatric diagnosis than would be expected from population-based data. More frequent reported modafinil use was associated with higher numbers of perceived benefits whilst reported frequency of use was not associated with the number of perceived risks. There was also a tentative link between the reported use of modafinil and the reported presence of psychiatric disorders, largely depression and anxiety. Respondents who had reported a psychiatric diagnosis declared higher subjective benefits of modafinil. This may suggest further beneficial effects of modafinil or it may reflect insufficient medical treatment for psychiatric disorders in some people. Overall, the findings of the current study should be beneficial in informing clinicians and legislative bodies about the modafinil user profile and how modafinil is perceived."

After the training period, the swimmer group showed a significant increase in swimming performance, body weight and length. In scanning electron microscopy of the gills, the average length of centrally located primary filaments appeared significantly longer in the swimmer than in the non-trained control group (+6.1%, 1639 μm vs. 1545 μm, p = 0.00043) and the average number of secondary filaments increased significantly (+7.7%, 49.27 vs. 45.73, p = 9e-09). Micro-computed tomography indicated a significant increase in the gill volume (p = 0.048) by 11.8% from 0.490 mm3 to 0.549 mm3. The space-filling complexity dropped significantly (p = 0.0088) by 8.2% from 38.8% to 35.9%., i.e. making the gills of the swimmers less compact. Respirometry after 5 weeks showed a significantly higher oxygen consumption (+30.4%, p = 0.0081) of trained fish during exercise compared to controls. Scanning electron microscopy revealed different stages of new secondary filament budding, which happened at the tip of the primary lamellae. Using BrdU we could confirm that the growth of the secondary filaments took place mainly in the distal half and the tip and for primary filaments mainly at the tip. We conclude that the zebrafish respiratory organ—unlike the mammalian lung—has a high plasticity, and after endurance training increases its volume and changes its structure in order to facilitate O2 uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3005427724,"Background Migrants from high endemic countries accounted for 18% of newly diagnosed HIV infections in Europe in 2017. Knowledge on the link between HIV risk and post-migration travels and their impact on HIV acquisition is scarce, but critical to inform prevention. This study aims to explore risky sexual behaviour and HIV-acquisition among sub-Saharan African migrants, and to assess post-migration mobility as a determinant of sexual risk behaviour. Methods Data from two cross-sectional bio-behavioural surveys to assess HIV-prevalence conducted in Lisbon and Antwerp were analysed to explore migration-related characteristics, travel patterns, and sexual risk taking in the host country and abroad. Bi- and multivariate associations were estimated through adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals; multivariable logistic regression determined factors associated with condomless sexual intercourse. Results Among N = 1508 participants above 18 years (58% males), 68% travelled post-migration (49.2% reported intercourse abroad). The overall proportion of condomless sex at last sexual intercourse was high (68.1%). The odds of condomless sex in the host country was five times higher when the last sexual intercourse abroad was also condomless [OR:5.32; 95%CI:2.98–9.25]. About half of the travellers reported concurrency, i.e. a regular partner in the host country while having other sexual partners abroad. Almost three percent of the participants reported being HIV+, but 5% had a reactive HIV test-result, with similar proportions among travellers and non-travellers. Also, among the n = 75 participants with reactive HIV test-results, condomless sex occurred (n = 40) and was associated with mobility. Conclusions Sub-Saharan African migrants are mobile and engage in sexual risk behaviours in the countries of residence and while travelling, increasing risk of post-migration HIV-acquisition. A transnational perspective on HIV prevention and sexual health promotion is needed for effectively reducing migrants’ HIV risk related to their mobility."

Nowadays, different types of EDA measuring devices are used in highly versatile fields–from research, health-care and education to entertainment industry. But despite their universal use the quality of their measuring function (their accuracy) is questioned or investigated very seldom. In this paper, we propose a concept of an EDA patient simulator—a device enabling metrological testing of EDA devices by means of a variable resistance. EDA simulator was designed based on a programmable light-controlled resistor with a wide resistance range, capable of simulating skin conductance levels (SCL) and responses (SCR) and was equipped with an artificial hand. The hand included electrically conductive fingers for attachment of EDA device electrodes. A minimal set of tests for evaluating an EDA device was identified, the simulator’s functionality discussed and some testing results presented."
https://openalex.org/W3004661583,"Over the last two decades, private renting has undergone a major revival in the UK, more than doubling its share within the housing system. Young adults increasingly remain in the sector into their 30s, giving rise to the term 'Generation Rent'. Using data from the UK's Family Resources Survey, this article shows how reliance on the sector varies by poverty status, particularly for young adults and children. In 2017/18, 42 per cent of adults under 40 in low-income poverty lived in private renting, compared with just 26 per cent of non-poor. This is almost double the proportion of 20 years earlier. Private renting is now home to more poor adults under 40 than owner occupation and social renting combined. In addition, one in three children in poverty (36 per cent) now lives in private renting, three times the level of 20 years ago. For both adults and children, rates are even higher in London and the South. Although rates of increase have slowed in recent years, this dramatic shift in the housing circumstances of those in poverty has a number of implications for housing and social policy which have not yet been sufficiently recognised."
https://openalex.org/W3004984010,"HIV-1 infection is characterized by generalized deregulation of the immune system, resulting in increased chronic immune activation. However, some individuals called HIV controllers (HICs) present spontaneous control of viral replication and have a more preserved immune system. Among HICs, discordant results have been observed regarding immune activation and the frequency of different T cell subsets, including Treg and Th17 cells. We evaluated T cell immune activation, differentiation and regulatory profiles in two groups of HICs-elite controllers (ECs) and viremic controllers (VCs)-and compared them to those of cART-treated individuals (cART) and HIV-1-negative (HIV-neg) individuals. ECs demonstrated similar levels of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in comparison to HIV-neg, while cART and VCs showed elevated T cell activation. CD4+ T cell subset analyses showed differences only for transitional memory T cell frequency between the EC and HIV-neg groups. However, VC individuals showed higher frequencies of terminally differentiated, naïve, and stem cell memory T cells and lower frequencies of transitional memory and central memory T cells compared to the HIV-neg group. Among CD8+ T cell subsets, ECs presented higher frequencies of stem cell memory T cells, while VCs presented higher frequencies of terminally differentiated T cells compared to the HIV-neg group. HICs showed lower frequencies of total Treg cells compared to the HIV-neg and cART groups. ECs also presented higher frequencies of activated and a lower frequency of resting Treg cells than the HIV-neg and cART groups. Furthermore, we observed a high frequency of Th17 cells in ECs and high Th17/Treg ratios in both HIC groups. Our data showed that ECs had low levels of activated T cells and a high frequency of activated Treg and Th17 cells, which could restrict chronic immune activation and be indicative of a preserved mucosal response in these individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3005236286,"Biofilms are currently considered as a predominant lifestyle of many bacteria in nature. While they promote survival of microbes, biofilms also potentially increase the threats to animal and public health in case of pathogenic species. They not only facilitate bacteria transmission and persistence, but also promote spreading of antibiotic resistance leading to chronic infections. In the case of Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, biofilms have remained largely enigmatic. Here, applying live and static confocal microscopy, we report growth and ultrastructural organization of the biofilms formed in vitro by these microorganisms over the early transition from coccobacillary into coccoid shape during biofilm assembly. Using selective dispersing agents, we provided evidence for extracellular DNA (eDNA) being a major and conserved structural component of mature biofilms formed by both F. subsp. novicida and a human clinical isolate of F. philomiragia. We also observed a higher physical robustness of F. novicida biofilm as compared to F. philomiragia one, a feature likely promoted by specific polysaccharides. Further, F. novicida biofilms resisted significantly better to ciprofloxacin than their planktonic counterparts. Importantly, when grown in biofilms, both Francisella species survived longer in cold water as compared to free-living bacteria, a trait possibly associated with a gain in fitness in the natural aquatic environment. Overall, this study provides information on survival of Francisella when embedded with biofilms that should improve both the future management of biofilm-related infections and the design of effective strategies to tackle down the problematic issue of bacteria persistence in aquatic ecosystems."

Troponin genes emerged 500–700 million years ago during early animal evolution. Troponin T (TnT) is the thin-filament–anchoring subunit of troponin. Vertebrate and invertebrate TnTs have conserved core structures, reflecting conserved functions in regulating muscle contraction, and they also contain significantly diverged structures, reflecting muscle type- and species-specific adaptations. TnT in insects contains a highly-diverged structure consisting of a long glutamic acid–rich C-terminal extension of ˜70 residues with unknown function. We found here that C-terminally truncated Drosophila TnT (TpnT–CD70) retains binding of tropomyosin, troponin I, and troponin C, indicating a preserved core structure of TnT. However, the mutant TpnTCD70 gene residing on the X chromosome resulted in lethality in male flies. We demonstrate that this X-linked mutation produces dominant-negative phenotypes, including decreased flying and climbing abilities, in heterozygous female flies. Immunoblot quantification with a TpnT-specific mAb indicated expression of TpnT–CD70 in vivo and normal stoichiometry of total TnT in myofilaments of heterozygous female flies. Light and EM examinations revealed primarily normal sarcomere structures in female heterozygous animals, whereas Z-band streaming could be observed in the jump muscle of these flies. Although TpnT–CD70-expressing flies exhibited lower resistance to cardiac stress, their hearts were significantly more tolerant to Ca2+ overloading induced by high-frequency electrical pacing.

To study the molecular evolution of troponin by characterizing its conservation and diversity in invertebrate and vertebrate muscles is a powerful approach to understand the structure–function relationship of troponin in determining muscle contractility in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. By interaction with tropomyosin in the thin filament, TnT plays an organizer role in the center of the sarcomeric Ca2+-regulatory system (8Tobacman L.S. Thin filament-mediated regulation of cardiac contraction.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58 (8815803): 447-48110.1146/annurev.ph.58.030196.002311Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Vertebrates have evolved with three homologous genes encoding the cardiac, fast, and slow skeletal muscle-type isoforms of TnT, whereas most invertebrates such as insects have only a single TnT gene (6Cao T. Thongam U. Jin J.P. Invertebrate troponin: insights into the evolution and regulation of striated muscle contraction.Arch. Biochem.

Gene structure and molecular evolution studies identified the fast skeletal muscle TnT as the ancestral form of the three vertebrate muscle-type–specific isoforms (9Chong S.M. Jin J.P.

The phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1A, constructed from protein sequences of representative invertebrate TnT and vertebrate fast TnT, shows their evolutionary lineage and overall divergence. Previous studies have extensively demonstrated the critical role of troponin in the Ca2+ regulation of insect muscle contraction (10Bullard B. Pastore A.

The Drosophila TpnT locus on chromosome X encodes several physiological alternative splicing variants, whereas aberrant splicing or missense mutations cause muscle abnormalities such as the upheld and indented thorax phenotypes (11Fyrberg E.

Linear structural comparison between vertebrate and Drosophila TnT (Fig. 1B) shows a large portion of conserved structures corresponding to their conserved core functions. Vertebrate and invertebrate TnTs both have an alternatively-spliced N-terminal variable region (5Jin J.P. Zhang Z. Bautista J.A.

After several decades of research, the functional significance of these variable structures of TnT remains not fully understood. A diverged structure of invertebrate TnT found in flying insects is a long C-terminal extension with a high content of glutamic acid residues (Fig. 1B) (11Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. Drosophila melanogaster troponin-T mutations engender three distinct syndromes of myofibrillar abnormalities.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216 (2124273): 657-67510.1016/0022-2836(90)90390-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The function of this highly-diverged structure of insect TnT and its fitness value during natural selection are of significant interest. The N-terminal variable region of some vertebrate TnTs also has high Glu contents (5Jin J.P. Zhang Z. Bautista J.A. Isoform diversity, regulation, and functional adaptation of troponin and calponin.Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2008; 18 (18304026): 93-12410.1615/CritRevEukarGeneExpr.v18.i2.10Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This similar trait is most striking in the fast skeletal muscle TnT specifically expressed in adult avian pectoral muscles (17Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.P. Acidic and basic troponin T isoforms in mature fast-twitch skeletal muscle and effect on contractility.Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276 (10329966): C1162-C117010.1152/ajpcell.1999.276.5.C1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This potentially-convergent structural similarity can be clearly seen in the paired dot-plot comparison between eagle pectoral muscle TnT and Drosophila TnT (Fig. 1C). Considering that avian leg muscle TnT has a much shorter N-terminal variable region (18Jin J.P. Samanez R.A. Evolution of a metal-binding cluster in the NH2-terminal variable region of avian fast skeletal muscle troponin T: functional divergence on the basis of tolerance to structural drifting.J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52 (11231890): 103-11610.1007/s002390010139Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and fast TnT of the emu, a flightless bird, has lost this structure (Fig. 1B), we propose that the long Glu-rich segments in insect TnT and avian pectoral muscle TnT may have both evolved from an analogous evolutionary selection for flight abilities. Supporting this hypothesis, a previous study found that the Glu-rich N-terminal segment of avian pectoral muscle TnT has a physiologically relevant Ca2+-binding capacity (19Zhang Z. Jin J.P. Root D.D. Binding of calcium ions to an avian flight muscle troponin T.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (14992602): 2645-265510.1021/bi035067oCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which may play a novel role in the Ca2+ regulation of muscle contraction. In this study, we genetically engineered flies to demonstrate that deletion of the C-terminal 70 amino acids of Drosophila TnT (TpnT–CD70) significantly decreases muscle and heart functions, establishing the biological importance of the Glu-rich C-terminal extension of insect TnT. In the meantime, fly hearts expressing TpnT–CD70 exhibited significantly increased tolerance to Ca2+ overloading during high-frequency electrical pacing, supporting the potential role of the Glu-rich segment in TnT as a myofilament Ca2+ buffer/reservoir. cDNAs encoding three N-terminal alternative splicing variants of Drosophila TpnT were cloned via RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from whole adult flies. The corresponding protein variants are compared in the linear structural maps in Fig. 2. A novel splice form of Drosophila TnT with the exon 5-encoded segment in the N-terminal variable region excluded and exon 10A in the C-terminal mutually-exclusive splicing region was identified among the cloned cDNAs. The sequence has been deposited to GenBankTM with accession number MK227440. The other two cDNA variants cloned encode the high- and low-molecular-weight TnT splice forms that are predominantly expressed in normal adult Drosophila muscles (Fig. 2). Intact Drosophila TnT proteins exhibited significant toxicity to host E. coli cells and did not yield a preparative level of expression (data not shown). In sharp contrast, Drosophila TpnT–CD70 exon 10A and TpnT–CD70 exon 10B proteins with the C-terminal Glu-rich segment removed express in E. coli at high levels (Fig. 3). Both exon 10A and exon 10B variants of TpnT–CD70 proteins were purified using conventional biochemical methods (Fig. 3) for functional characterization. Because the C-terminal Glu-rich extension is an evolutionarily-diverged structure in invertebrates such as insects, we anticipated its deletion would not destroy the core functions of Drosophila TnT. To validate this hypothesis, protein-binding studies showed that both exon 10A and exon 10B variants of Drosophila TpnT–CD70 have high-affinity binding to rabbit α-tropomyosin (Fig. 4A), bovine cardiac TnI (Fig. 4B), and chicken fast skeletal muscle TnC in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 4C) or 0.1 mm EGTA (Fig. 4D), comparable with the control of chicken fast skeletal muscle TnT that is a native binding partner of the vertebrate tropomyosin, TnI, and TnC used in this study to overcome the lack of purified insect myofilament proteins. The biochemical assessment demonstrates that deletion of the C-terminal Glu-rich segment does not abolish the core functions of Drosophila TnT. Within the physiological range, Drosophila TpnT–CD70 proteins showed lower affinity for vertebrate tropomyosin but higher affinity for vertebrate TnI (Fig. 4, A and B). The binding of TpnT–CD70 proteins to TnC is Ca2+-dependent, similar to that of chicken fast TnT (Fig. 4D) and consistent with previous studies of vertebrate troponin (20Wang Z.Y. Sarkar S. Gergely J. Tao T. Ca2+-dependent interactions between the C-helix of troponin-C and troponin-I. Photocross-linking and fluorescence studies using a recombinant troponin-C.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265 (2180953): 4953-4957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preserved biochemical activities of TnT–CD70 proteins indicate their preserved core functions in muscle thin-filament regulation. The presence of the mutually-exclusive alternative exons 10A or 10B produced different binding affinities for tropomyosin and TnC (Fig. 4), indicating functional impacts of this alternatively-spliced segment of TnT, which are under investigation together with the vertebrate counterparts, exon 16 and exon 17, in fast TnT (5Jin J.P. Zhang Z. Bautista J.A. Isoform diversity, regulation, and functional adaptation of troponin and calponin.Crit. Rev. Eukaryot.

With the evidence that deletion of the C-terminal Glu-rich segment does not abolish the core function in Drosophila TpnT–CD70 protein (Fig. 4), TpnT–CD70 mutant flies were developed. Illustrated in Fig. 5, the mutant allele was constructed by inserting a stop codon in exon 11 of the TpnT gene on chromosome X using CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing to truncate the last 70 amino acids of the polypeptide chain and delete the C-terminal Glu-rich segment. The red fluorescence protein (RFP) selection marker was subsequently removed by crossing with a Cre line to establish a line of RFP− TpnTCD70 mutant fly. After confirmation by DNA sequencing of the targeted region, phenotypic studies were performed using both RFP+ and RFP− mutant flies. Although the CD70 truncation of Drosophila TnT does not abolish its biochemical functions (Fig. 4), the TpnTCD70 allele produced embryonic lethality in vivo. Shown in the segregation pattern during breeding (Table 1), the X-linked TpnTCD70 mutation causes 100% death of mutant males before hatching. Therefore, TpnTCD70 homozygous females would be lethal as well, although test breeding could not be done due to the lack of mutant male parents.Table 1Non-Mendelian segregation of the X-linked TpnT-CD70 allele demonstrates embryonic lethalityParentsEmbryosHatching rateWT♀TnTCD70/+♀WT♂TnTCD70♂WT♀/total embryosWT♂/total embryosTnTCD70/+♀/total embryosTnTCD70♂WT♀×WT♂66098.0%311NA336NA48.1%51.9%NANATnTCD70/+♀×WT♂60774.6%153150150025.2%24.7%24.7%0.0% Open table in a new tab With the presence of one WT X chromosome, heterozygous TpnTCD70/+ females are viable and fertile, appearing in the expected Mendelian ratio (Table 1). Therefore, TpnTCD70/+ females were used as subjects for phenotypic characterization. From immunization using Drosophila TpnT–CD70 protein, a mouse hybridoma cell line secreting anti-Drosophila TnT mAb (2C12) was established after multiple rounds of subcloning. Characterization of the hybridoma cell culture supernatant using Western blotting showed that mAb 2C12 specifically recognizes TnT bands in total muscle homogenates of adult fly and total protein extracts of whole larvae without detectable cross-reaction to any other proteins (Fig. 6A). Western blotting showed that mAb 2C12 does not cross-react with cardiac or skeletal muscle TnT in multiple vertebrate species, including the ancestral species hagfish (Fig. 6A), indicating its recognition of a fly TnT-specific epitope. Shown in the high-sensitivity ELISA titration of 2C12 hybridoma culture supernatants in Fig. 6B, mAb 2C12 has equally high affinities against the exon 10A and exon 10B variants of Drosophila TpnT–CD70 with no cross-reaction to chicken breast muscle fast TnT and human cardiac TnT, confirming its specificity to fly TnT under nondenaturing conditions. This new mAb provides a critical tool to examine the expression of TpnT–CD70 proteins in mutant fly muscle and heart and to establish the causal effect on functional phenotypes. The Western blotting data in Fig. 6A further show that there are two major TnT splice forms expressed in adult Drosophila muscles, of which the low-molecular-weight form is predominant in the indirect flight muscle (IFM), whereas the adult jump muscles express both splice forms at similar levels. In contrast, the total protein extracts from Drosophila larvae predominantly express the high-molecular-weight splice form (Fig. 6A). With protein controls expressed in E. coli from cloned cDNAs (Fig. 7), the high- and low-molecular-weight splice forms of TnT predominantly expressed in adult Drosophila muscles correspond to the two previously identified N-terminal alternative splicing variants shown in Fig. 2. An intermediate size TnT splice form was detected in Drosophila larva (Fig. 6A), of which the exon inclusion pattern and developmental and functional significance remain to be investigated. Age-matched (5 and 14 days old as noted for each experiment) female TpnTCD70/+ heterozygote and w1118 control flies were studied for muscle and heart phenotypes. We first examined the expression of the TpnT–CD70 protein in mutant fly muscles in vivo to validate this new experimental model. mAb 2C12 Western blottings on total protein extracted from flight and jump muscles isolated from TpnTCD70/+ heterozygote female flies detected significant amounts of two variants of truncated TnT proteins (Fig. 7). To confirm them as the C-terminal truncated version of the two N-terminal alternative splice forms (Fig. 2) that are predominantly expressed in adult fly muscles (Fig. 6A), we showed their SDS gel mobility identical to that of the corresponding CD-70 protein size controls expressed in E. coli from cloned cDNA (Fig. 7). The levels of TpnT–CD70 proteins relative to their intact counterparts in TpnTCD70/+ heterozygote female fly muscles were calculated from Western blotting densitometry (Fig. 7). Removal of the RFP cassette significantly increased the expression of TpnT–CD70 protein in both in IFM and jump muscle (Fig. 7), indicating a negative effect of the RFP cassette on gene transcription and/or mRNA stability. The ratios of high- and low-molecular-weight splice forms in jump muscles were similar for the intact and CD70 forms (Fig. 7B), indicating that the insertion of stop codon in exon 11 did not affect the alternative splicing pattern of the N-terminal coding exons (Fig. 2). Densitometry quantification of total TnT detected in Western blottings versus the level of actin determined in parallel SDS gels showed similar stoichiometry in WT and transgenic fly muscles (Fig. 7), excluding haploid insufficiency from possibly causing the lethality of TpnTCD70 male embryos or the phenotypes of heterozygote females. Previous studies have determined that the level of troponin protein detected in striated muscle cells reflects the actual amount integrated in the myofilaments (21Feng H.Z. Hossain M.M. Huang X.P. Jin J.P. Myofilament incorporation determines the stoichiometry of troponin I in transgenic expression and the rescue of a null mutation.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 487 (19433057): 36-4110.1016/j.abb.2009.05.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and nonmyofilament-integrated TnT is rapidly degraded in muscle cells (22Wang X. Huang Q.Q. Breckenridge M.T. Chen A. Crawford T.O. Morton D.H. Jin J.P. Cellular fate of truncated slow skeletal muscle troponin T produced by Glu180 nonsense mutation in Amish nemaline myopathy.J. Biol.

Therefore, the protein stoichiometry study demonstrated that TpnT–CD70 is effectively integrated into the myofilaments in Drosophila muscle in vivo. The in vivo protein expression and stoichiometry data established that dominant-negative effects of the C-terminal truncation of Drosophila TnT causes embryonic lethality in males and the phenotypes of heterozygote females, justifying the TpnT–CD70 fly model for use as an informative system to investigate the functional significance of the Glu-rich long C-terminal extension of insect TnT. To investigate the functional effect of deleting the insect-specific C-terminal Glu-rich extension of TnT on muscle functions in vivo, acute flight ability was assessed in heterozygote mutant (TpnTCD70/+, without RFP) and WT (w1118) flies. The results in Fig. 8A show that the average landing height of the mutant flies was decreased, indicating a negative impact of TnT–CD70 on the function of flight muscles. Climbing velocity of the mutant flies is also significantly decreased compared with WT control (Fig. 8B), consistent with decreased muscle functions. Reduced function is also apparent when endurance is tested by repetitive induction of climbing (Fig. 8C), indicating dysfunction in both acute and chronic muscle activities. Assessed for functional capacity by pacing at 6 Hz for 30 s, the hearts of TpnTCD70/+ mutant flies were significantly more sensitive to the stress pacing compared with WT control (Fig. 9A), demonstrating that the C-terminal Glu-rich extension of TnT is required for normal cardiac functional durability. To test the hypothesis that the Glu-rich C-terminal extension of insect TnT functions as a myofilament Ca2+ buffer/reservoir, as suggested previously for the N-terminal Glu-rich segment of avian pectoral muscle TnT (19Zhang Z. Jin J.P. Root D.D. Binding of calcium ions to an avian flight muscle troponin T.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (14992602): 2645-265510.1021/bi035067oCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), mutant flies were tested in short durations of high frequency cardiac pacing. In contrast to the decreased tolerance to overall cardiac stress shown in Fig. 9A, TpnTCD70/+ hearts were more resistant to 5-s episodes of high frequency pacing, with fewer fibrillation (Fig. 9B) and arrest (Fig. 9C) events than WT control. This result suggests that the mutant fly hearts are more resistant to acute Ca2+ overloading produced by the electrical pacing–induced membrane depolarization of cardiomyocytes. This novel finding supports the notion that removal of the long Glu-rich C-terminal extension of Drosophila TnT diminishes a Ca2+ buffer in the myofilaments, resulting in a lower baseline content of Ca2+, which allows cardiomyocytes to better tolerate acute Ca2+ overloading. Whole-mount imaging of heart and muscle tissues of age-matched TpnTCD70/+ and control flies showed similar striation patterns without notable overall or regional myofibril disorganization (Fig. 10A). Quantitative analysis showed that the resting sarcomeres are longer in the heart (Fig. 10B) and jump muscle (Fig. 10C) of TpnTCD70/+ flies than that in the controls. In contrast, it is not different in IFMs of TpnTCD70/+ and control flies (Fig. 10D), indicating a likely phenotypic difference between synchronous and asynchronous muscles. The ultrastructure of TpnTCD70/+ mutant fly muscles was examined using transmission electron microscopy (EM) at 14 days of age. Compared with w1118 controls, primarily normal sarcomeric structures are seen in both IFM and jump muscle (Fig. 11). TpnTCD70"

To date, the experiences and evaluation of psychotherapists regarding collaboration and stepped care have been neglected. In order to improve collaborative mental health care, this qualitative study aimed at identifying psychotherapists’ perspectives and needs within collaboration and stepped care. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 20 German outpatient psychotherapists were conducted and analyzed applying thematic analysis. The analysis was realized in a recursive process to first identify themes and then relate these themes back to the research questions with regard to collaboration and stepped care. Results Collaboration mainly took place in small networks, with general practitioners and psychiatrists as the most important partners and psychotherapists wishing to intensify collaboration. Main barriers for collaboration were seen in deficient resources and remuneration and in a perceived lack of esteem by other medical specialties. Stepped care was appreciated for intensified collaboration and low-threshold access to care. Doubts were cast on its implementation within current health care conditions, worries concerned a primacy of economic principles instead of patient-orientation. Among further needs, psychotherapists demanded increased knowledge about psychotherapy, especially among general practitioners. Conclusion Psychotherapists expressed ambivalent attitudes towards stepped and collaborative care, substantially influenced by health care conditions and the perceived own standing among care providers. Psychotherapists’ needs within stepped care comprise intensified collaboration, sufficient time, personal and financial resources for collaboration and opportunities for a constructive interprofessional dialogue."
https://openalex.org/W3004426967,"Despite the importance of acquiring economic competencies at the secondary level and the worldwide popularity of economics in higher education, there is almost no research on the effects of economic competencies on economics student retention. Based on a longitudinal sample of 538 high school students in Switzerland, this study provides the first results on this topic. The longitudinal study took place from 2011 to 2016 and comprised two points of measurement. Economic competencies were measured multidimensionally and comprised knowledge and skills, as well as attitude, value-oriented dispositions, interest and motivation. Different student retention models were adapted and combined to explain student retention in the field of economics. According to these models, students' academic and social integration are key mediators to predict their retention. Based on these theoretical explanations, structural equation modelling was then used to test the long-term effects of high school students' economic competencies at the end of upper-secondary school on their retention in studying in the field of economics. The results show that economic competencies predict economics students' academic integration (as measured by grade point average) but not their social integration. Additionally, the data confirm that academic and social integration are strong mediators for their retention. In addition to economic competencies, students' cognitive abilities, prior schooling (school grades, school profile, and school type) and perceived family support predict student retention in economics. Overall, economic competencies account for a substantial proportion of the variance in student retention. Against this background, the results indicate that fostering high school students' economic competencies plays a crucial role in their study success in the field of economics."
https://openalex.org/W3005182742,"Objective Research into dietary factors associated with hypertension has focused on the sodium component of salt. However, chloride has distinct physiological effects that may surpass the effect of sodium on blood pressure. This study aims to separate the specific effects of chloride and sodium intake on blood pressure. Methods We studied 5673 participants from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease(PREVEND) study. Urinary chloride(uCl) and sodium(uNa) were measured in two 24-hour collections. We used generalized-linear-regression to evaluate the relation of uCl and uNa with baseline blood pressure and Cox-proportional-hazards-analysis to assess the association with hypertension. Multicollinearity was assessed with Ridge regression. Results Baseline 24-hour uCl was 135±39mmol and uNa was 144±54mmol. The correlation between uCl and uNa was high (Pearson’s r = 0.96). UCl and uNa had similar non-significant positive and linear associations with blood pressure. In 3515 normotensive patients, 1021 patients developed hypertension during a median follow-up of 7.4 years. UCl and uNa had a comparable but non-significant J-shaped effect on the risk of hypertension. Adding both uCl and uNa to the same model produced instability, demonstrated by Ridge coefficients that converged or changed sign. The single index of uNa minus uCl showed a non-significant higher risk of hypertension of 2% per 10mmol/24-hour difference (HR1.02, 95%CI 0.98–1.06). Conclusion UCl and uNa had similar positive but non-significant associations with blood pressure and risk of hypertension and their effects could not be disentangled. Hence, the alleged adverse effects of high salt intake could be due to sodium, chloride or both. This encourages further study into the effect of chloride in order to complement dietary recommendations currently focused on sodium alone."
https://openalex.org/W3005381516,"Aim Current resuscitation guidelines recommend waveform capnography as an indirect indicator of perfusion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Chest compressions (CCs) and ventilations during CPR have opposing effects on the exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, which need to be better characterized. The purpose of this study was to model the impact of ventilations in the exhaled CO2 measured from capnograms collected during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) resuscitation. Methods We retrospectively analyzed OHCA monitor-defibrillator files with concurrent capnogram, compression depth, transthoracic impedance and ECG signals. Segments with CC pauses, two or more ventilations, and with no pulse-generating rhythm were selected. Thus, only ventilations should have caused the decrease in CO2 concentration. The variation in the exhaled CO2 concentration with each ventilation was modeled with an exponential decay function using non-linear-least-squares curve fitting. Results Out of the original 1002 OHCA dataset (one per patient), 377 episodes had the required signals, and 196 segments from 96 patients met the inclusion criteria. Airway type was endotracheal tube in 64.8% of the segments, supraglottic King LT-D™ in 30.1%, and unknown in 5.1%. Median (IQR) decay factor of the exhaled CO2 concentration was 10.0% (7.8 − 12.9) with R2 = 0.98(0.95 − 0.99). Differences in decay factor with airway type were not statistically significant (p = 0.17). From these results, we propose a model for estimating the contribution of CCs to the end-tidal CO2 level between consecutive ventilations and for estimating the end-tidal CO2 variation as a function of ventilation rate. Conclusion We have modeled the decrease in exhaled CO2 concentration with ventilations during chest compression pauses in CPR. This finding allowed us to hypothesize a mathematical model for explaining the effect of chest compressions on ETCO2 compensating for the influence of ventilation rate during CPR. However, further work is required to confirm the validity of this model during ongoing chest compressions."
https://openalex.org/W3005397332,"The effect of age and gender in risk estimates related to long-term residence in areas contaminated by nuclear power plant fallout was evaluated by applying the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) concept to an existing exposure model that was previously used for cumulative effective dose estimates. In this study, we investigated the influence of age distribution on the number of cancer cases by applying five different age distributions from nuclear power–producing countries (India, Japan, South Korea, and the United States), and Egypt because of intentions to develop nuclear power. The model was also used to estimate the effective dose and gender-specific LAR as a function of time after fallout for the offspring of the population living in 137Cs fallout areas. The principal findings of this study are that the LAR of cancer incidence (excluding non-fatal skin cancers) over 70 y is about 4.5 times higher for newborn females (5.4% per MBq m-2 of initial 137Cs ground deposition) than the corresponding values for 30 y old women (1.2% per MBq m-2 137Cs deposition). The cumulative LAR for newborn males is more than 3 times higher (3.2% versus 1.0% per MBq m-2 137Cs deposition). The model predicts a generally higher LAR for women until 50 y of age, after which the gender difference converges. Furthermore, the detriment for newborns in the fallout areas initially decreases rapidly (about threefold during the first decade) and then decreases gradually with an approximate half-time of 10–12 y after the first decade. The age distribution of the exposed cohort has a decisive impact on the average risk estimates, and in our model, these are up to about 65% higher in countries with high birth rates compared to low birth rates. This trend implies larger average lifetime attributable risks in countries with a highly proportional younger population. In conclusion, the large dispersion (up to a factor of 4 between newborns and 30 y olds) in the lifetime detriment per unit ground deposition of 137Cs over gender and age in connection with accidental nuclear releases justifies the effort in developing risk models that account for the higher radiation sensitivity in younger populations."
https://openalex.org/W3004525268,"Prolonged periods of sedentary behavior are linked to cardiometabolic disease independent of exercise and physical activity. This study examined the effects of posture by comparing one day of sitting (14.4 ± 0.3 h) to one day of standing (12.2 ± 0.1 h) on postprandial metabolism the following day. Eighteen subjects (9 men, 9 women; 24 ± 1 y) completed two trials (sit or stand) in a crossover design. The day after prolonged sitting or standing the subjects completed a postprandial high fat/glucose tolerance test, during which blood and expired gas was collected immediately before and hourly for 6 h after the ingestion of the test meal. Indirect calorimetry was used to measure substrate oxidation while plasma samples were analyzed for triglyceride, glucose, and insulin concentrations. Standing resulted in a lower fasting plasma triglyceride concentration (p = 0.021) which was primarily responsible for an 11.3% reduction in total area under the curve (p = 0.022) compared to sitting. However, no difference between trials in incremental area under the curve for plasma triglycerides was detected (p>0.05). There were no differences in substrate oxidation, plasma glucose concentration, or plasma insulin concentration (all p>0.05). These data demonstrate that 12 h of standing compared to 14 h of sitting has a small effect the next day by lowering fasting plasma triglyceride concentration, and this contributed to a 11.3% reduction in postprandial plasma triglyceride total area under the curve (p = 0.022) compared to sitting."
https://openalex.org/W3004580437,"Background Mass administrations of antimalarial drugs (MDA) have reduced the incidence and prevalence of P. falciparum infections in a trial in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Here we assess the impact of the MDA on P. vivax infections. Methods Between May 2013 and July 2017, four villages in each Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia and Lao PDR were selected based on high prevalence of P. falciparum infections. Eight of the 16 villages were randomly assigned to receive MDA consisting of three-monthly rounds of three-day courses of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and, except in Cambodia, a single low-dose of primaquine. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted at quarterly intervals to detect Plasmodium infections using ultrasensitive qPCR. The difference in the cumulative incidence between the groups was assessed through a discrete time survival approach, the difference in prevalence through a difference-in-difference analysis, and the difference in the number of participants with a recurrence of P. vivax infection through a mixed-effect logistic regression. Results 3,790 (86%) residents in the intervention villages participated in at least one MDA round, of whom 2,520 (57%) participated in three rounds. The prevalence of P. vivax infections fell from 9.31% to 0.89% at month 3 but rebounded by six months to 5.81%. There was no evidence that the intervention reduced the cumulative incidence of P.vivax infections (95% confidence interval [CI] Odds ratio (OR): 0.29 to 1.36). Similarly, there was no evidence of MDA related reduction in the number of participants with at least one recurrent infection (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.08 to 1.42). Conclusion MDA with schizontocidal drugs had a lasting effect on P. falciparum infections but only a transient effect on the prevalence of P. vivax infections. Radical cure with an 8-aminoquinoline will be needed for the rapid elimination of vivax malaria."
https://openalex.org/W3005275813,"Natural selection of beneficial genetic variants played a critical role in human adaptation to a wide range of environmental conditions. Northern Eurasia, despite its severe climate, is home to lots of ethnically diverse populations. The genetic variants associated with the survival of these populations have hardly been analyzed. We searched for the genomic signatures of positive selection in (1) the genome-wide microarray data of 432 people from eight different northern Russian populations and (2) the whole-genome sequences of 250 people from Northern Eurasia from a public repository through testing the extended haplotype homozigosity (EHH) and direct comparison of allele frequency, respectively. The 20 loci with the strongest selection signals were characterized in detail. Among the top EHH hits were the NRG3 and NBEA genes, which are involved in the development and functioning of the neural system, the PTPRM gene, which mediates cell-cell interactions and adhesion, and a region on chromosome 4 (chr4:28.7-28.9 Mb) that contained several loci affiliated with different classes of non-coding RNAs (RN7SL101P, MIR4275, MESTP3, and LINC02364). NBEA and the region on chromosome 4 were novel selection targets that were identified for the first time in Western Siberian populations. Cross-population comparisons of EHH profiles suggested a particular role for the chr4:28.7-28.9 Mb region in the local adaptation of Western Siberians. The strongest selection signal identified in Siberian sequenced genomes was formed by six SNPs on chromosome 11 (chr11:124.9-125.2 Mb). This region included well-known genes SLC37A2 and PKNOX2. SLC37A2 is most-highly expressed in the gut. Its expression is regulated by vitamin D, which is often deficient in northern regions. The PKNOX2 gene is a transcription factor of the homeobox family that is expressed in the brain and many other tissues. This gene is associated with alcohol addiction, which is widespread in many Northern Eurasian populations."
https://openalex.org/W3004801790,"NF-κB is a pro-inflammatory transcription factor that critically regulates immune responses and other distinct cellular pathways. However, many NF-κB–mediated pathways for cell survival and apoptosis signaling in cancer remain to be elucidated. Cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory protein 1 (CARP-1 or CCAR1) is a perinuclear phosphoprotein that regulates signaling induced by anticancer chemotherapy and growth factors. Although previous studies have reported that CARP-1 is a part of the NF-κB proteome, regulation of NF-κB signaling by CARP-1 and the molecular mechanism(s) involved are unclear. Here, we report that CARP-1 directly binds the NF-κB–activating kinase IκB kinase subunit γ (NEMO or NF-κB essential modulator) and regulates the chemotherapy-activated canonical NF-κB pathway. Importantly, blockade of NEMO–CARP-1 binding diminished NF-κB activation, indicated by reduced phosphorylation of its subunit p65/RelA by the chemotherapeutic agent adriamycin (ADR), but not NF-κB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1β, or epidermal growth factor. High-throughput screening of a chemical library yielded a small molecule inhibitor of NEMO–CARP-1 binding, termed selective NF-κB inhibitor 1 (SNI)-1). We noted that SNI-1 enhances chemotherapy-dependent growth inhibition of a variety of cancer cells, including human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and patient-derived TNBC cells in vitro, and attenuates chemotherapy-induced secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-8. SNI-1 also enhanced ADR or cisplatin inhibition of murine TNBC tumors in vivo and reduced systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We conclude that inhibition of NEMO–CARP-1 binding enhances responses of cancer cells to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3004566271,"In this study, we introduce a hierarchical and modular computational model to explain how the CNS (Central Nervous System) controls arm reaching movement (ARM) in the frontal plane and under different conditions. The proposed hierarchical organization was established at three levels: 1) motor planning, 2) command production, and 3) motor execution. Since in this work we are not discussing motion learning, no learning procedure was considered in the model. Previous models mainly assume that the motor planning level produces the desired trajectories of the joints and feeds it to the next level to be tracked. In the proposed model, the motion control is described based on a regulatory control policy, that is, the output of the motor planning level is a step function defining the initial and final desired position of the hand. For the command production level, a nonlinear predictive model was developed to explain how the time-invariant muscle synergies (MSs) are recruited. We used the same computational model to explain the arm reaching motion for a combined ARM task. The combined ARM is defined as two successive ARM such that it starts from point A and reaches to point C via point B. To develop the model, kinematic and kinetic data from six subjects were recorded and analyzed during ARM task performance. The subjects used a robotic manipulator while moving their hand in the frontal plane. The EMG data of 15 muscles were also recorded. The MSs used in the model were extracted from the recorded EMG data. The proposed model explains two aspects of the motor control system by a novel computational approach: 1) the CNS reduces the dimension of the control space using the notion of MSs and thereby, avoids immense computational loads; 2) at the level of motor planning, the CNS generates the desired position of the hand at the starting, via and the final points, and this amounts to a regulatory and non-tracking structure."
https://openalex.org/W3005322015,"In this study, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the genus Bruggmanniella Tavares based on morphological features. Cladistic analyses were conducted using 57 characters from 26 species. All species of Bruggmanniella except for B. byrsonimae were selected as ingroup and the genera Asphondylia Loew, Bruggmannia Tavares, Illiciomyia Tokuda, Parazalepidota Maia, Pseudasphondylia Monzen, Schizomyia Kieffer, and Lopesia Rübsaamen as outgroup. We used characters from larvae, pupae, adults, and galls. The results of this study supported Bruggmanniella as the sister group of Pseudasphondylia. Bruggmanniella actinodaphnes Tokuda and Yukawa and B. cinnamomi Tokuda and Yukawa have been moved to genus Pseudasphondylia (Pseudasphondylia actinodaphnes (Tokuda and Yukawa) comb. nov. and Pseudasphondylia cinnamomi (Tokuda and Yukawa) comb. nov.). The new genus Odontokeros gen. nov. has been erected for the single species Odontokeros brevipes (Lin, Yang & Tokuda) comb. nov. In addition, we described a new Brazilian species, Bruggmanniella miconia Garcia, Lamas and Urso-Guimarães sp. nov. Identification keys to the New World species of Bruggmanniella are presented."
https://openalex.org/W3005419455,"Kernel abortion is common phenomenon in vivo haploid induction and closely linked with haploid induction rate, but little information of kernel abortion is available and its genetic basis still unclear. We used two mapping populations including 186 and 263 F2.3 family lines to analyze the different degree of kernel abortion and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for kernel abortion during haploid induction. In total 62 putative QTL, accounting for 3.27–14.70% of the phenotypic variation in kernel abortion traits, were detected across all 10 chromosomes. Ten QTL with over 10% contribution to phenotypic variation were affecting the fifth level of endosperm abortion (EnA5th), endosperm abortion (EnA) and total abortion (TA). Co-localization among kernel abortion traits QTL was observed in both populations and among different kernel abortion types. Five overlaps were indentified in the QTL for kernel abortion traits and HIR traits. Maize chromosome bins 3.01–3.02, 3.04–3.06, 4.05–4.06, 5.03–5.04, 8.06 were QTL hotspots for three or four traits related to the kernel abortion during haploid induction. Total kernel abortion rate (TAR) and HIR showed highly significant positive correlation. These findings may help to reveal haploid induction mechanisms and improve haploid production efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3004598730,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of a 150kV spectral filtration chest imaging protocol (Sn150kVp) combined with advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) on radiation dose and image quality in patients after lung-transplantation. Methods This study included 102 patients who had unenhanced chest-CT examinations available on both, a second-generation dual-source CT (DSCT) using standard protocol (100kVp, filtered-back-projection) and, on a third-generation DSCT using Sn150kVp protocol with ADMIRE. Signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) was measured in 6 standardized regions. A 5-point Likert scale was used to evaluate subjective image quality. Radiation metrics were compared. Results The mean time interval between the two acquisitions was 1.1±0.7 years. Mean-volume-CT-dose-index, dose-length-product and effective dose were significantly lower for Sn150kVp protocol (2.1±0.5mGy;72.6±16.9mGy*cm;1.3±0.3mSv) compared to 100kVp protocol (6.2±1.8mGy;203.6±55.6mGy*cm;3.7±1.0mSv) (p<0.001), equaling a 65% dose reduction. All studies were considered of diagnostic quality. SNR measured in lung tissue, air inside trachea, vertebral body and air outside the body was significantly higher in 100kVp protocol compared to Sn150kVp protocol (12.5±2.7vs.9.6±1.5;17.4±3.6vs.11.8±1.8;0.7±0.3vs.0.4±0.2;25.2±6.9vs.14.9±3.3;p<0.001). SNR measured in muscle tissue was significantly higher in Sn150kVp protocol (3.2±0.9vs.2.6±1.0;p<0.001). For SNR measured in descending aorta there was a trend towards higher values for Sn150kVp protocol (2.8±0.6 vs. 2.7±0.9;p = 0.3). Overall SNR was significantly higher in 100kVp protocol (5.0±4.0vs.4.0±4.0;p<0.001). On subjective analysis both protocols achieved a median Likert rating of 1 (25th-75th-percentile:1–1;p = 0.122). Interobserver agreement was good (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.73). Conclusions Combined use of 150kVp tin-filtered chest CT protocol with ADMIRE allows for significant dose reduction while maintaining highly diagnostic image quality in the follow up after lung transplantation when compared to a standard chest CT protocol using filtered back projection."
https://openalex.org/W3004648912,"More than 10% of the population will suffer from a depressive disorder during their lifetime, which represents a substantial economic and social burden for healthcare systems and societies. Nonetheless, studies suggest that an important percentage of patients receive inadequate treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients with depressive disorder in Spain, the current management of these disorders and the costs of specialised care. A retrospective multicentre study was designed including admission records from patients admitted due to a depressive disorder between 2011 and 2016, extracted from a Spanish claims database. The records obtained corresponded to 306,917 patients attended in primary care centres and 27,963 patients registered in specialised care settings. The number of admissions per patient progressively increased over the study period. A correlation was found with socioeconomic factors as the unemployment rate, increased versus the general population (OR = 1.41; 95%CI = 1.38-1.43). Equally, comorbid conditions as hypertension, disorders of lipoid metabolism, diabetes type II, other mood disorders and thyroid disorders were associated with severe presentations of a depressive disorder. In terms of disease management, patients with a severe disorder were the majority in specialised care settings, and most admissions were urgent and inpatient admissions. The use of both electroconvulsive therapy and drug therapy increased during the study period. In terms of costs, specialised care represented an annual cost of €9,654 per patient, and a total annual cost of €44,839,196. Altogether, improved detection and treatment protocols could contribute in reducing the burden that depressive disorders represent for the Spanish National Healthcare System."
