https://openalex.org/W2077611535,"Decision making in an uncertain environment poses a conflict between the opposing demands of gathering and exploiting information. In a classic illustration of this 'exploration-exploitation' dilemma, a gambler choosing between multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems, on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option, against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide information for improving future decisions). Far from representing idle curiosity, such exploration is often critical for organisms to discover how best to harvest resources such as food and water. In appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned by computational reinforcement learning (RL) theory, indicates that a dopaminergic, striatal and medial prefrontal network mediates learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration has been well studied from both theoretical and ethological perspectives, its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we show, in a gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be characterized by a computationally well-regarded strategy for addressing the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this characterization to classify decisions as exploratory or exploitative, we employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the frontopolar cortex and intraparietal sulcus are preferentially active during exploratory decisions. In contrast, regions of striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit activity characteristic of an involvement in value-based exploitative decision making. The results suggest a model of action selection under uncertainty that involves switching between exploratory and exploitative behavioural modes, and provide a computationally precise characterization of the contribution of key decision-related brain systems to each of these functions."

https://openalex.org/W2005154465,"Although interleukin-2 (IL-2) was initially characterized as the primary T-cell growth factor following in vitro activation1, less is known about its role in shaping T-cell responses to acute infections in vivo. The use of IL-2- or IL-2-receptor-deficient mice is problematic owing to their early development of autoimmunity2,3,4,5, attributable to the central role of IL-2 in the generation, maintenance and function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells6,7,8,9. To bypass these inherent difficulties, we have studied the effect of IL-2 on T-cell responses to acute infections by adopting a mixed chimaera strategy in which T cells lacking the high-affinity IL-2 receptor could be studied in an otherwise healthy mouse containing a full complement of regulatory T cells. Here we show that although IL-2 signalling to pathogen-specific CD8+ T cells affects the number of developing effector and memory cells very little, it is required for the generation of robust secondary responses. This is not due to an altered T-cell-receptor repertoire development or selection, and does not reflect an acute requirement for IL-2 during secondary activation and expansion. Rather, we demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for IL-2 during primary infection in programming the development of CD8+ memory T cells capable of full secondary expansion. These results have important implications for the development of vaccination or immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at boosting memory T-cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1987521590,"Sensory stimuli reach the brain via the thalamocortical projection, a group of axons thought to be among the most powerful in the neocortex. Surprisingly, these axons account for only ∼15% of synapses onto cortical neurons. The thalamocortical pathway might thus achieve its effectiveness via high-efficacy thalamocortical synapses or via amplification within cortical layer 4. In rat somatosensory cortex, we measured in vivo the excitatory postsynaptic potential evoked by a single synaptic connection and found that thalamocortical synapses have low efficacy. Convergent inputs, however, are both numerous and synchronous, and intracortical amplification is not required. Our results suggest a mechanism of cortical activation by which thalamic input alone can drive cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2134786991,"Throughout physics, stable composite objects are usually formed by way of attractive forces, which allow the constituents to lower their energy by binding together. Repulsive forces separate particles in free space. However, in a structured environment such as a periodic potential and in the absence of dissipation, stable composite objects can exist even for repulsive interactions. Here we report the observation of such an exotic bound state, which comprises a pair of ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical lattice. Consistent with our theoretical analysis, these repulsively bound pairs exhibit long lifetimes, even under conditions when they collide with one another. Signatures of the pairs are also recognized in the characteristic momentum distribution and through spectroscopic measurements. There is no analogue in traditional condensed matter systems of such repulsively bound pairs, owing to the presence of strong decay channels. Our results exemplify the strong correspondence between the optical lattice physics of ultracold bosonic atoms and the Bose-Hubbard model-a link that is vital for future applications of these systems to the study of strongly correlated condensed matter and to quantum information."
https://openalex.org/W1976750616,"In contrast to naïve T cells that recognize short antigen-derived peptides displayed by specialized antigen-presenting cells, immunoglobulin receptors of B lymphocytes primarily recognize intact proteins. How and where within a lymph node such unprocessed antigens become available for naïve B cell recognition is not clear. We used two-photon intravital imaging to show that, after exiting high-endothelial venules and before entry into lymph node follicles, B cells survey locally concentrated dendritic cells. Engagement of the B cell receptor by the dendritic cell (DC)–associated antigen leads to lymphocyte calcium signaling, migration arrest, antigen acquisition, and extrafollicular accumulation. These findings suggest a possible role for antigen-specific B-DC interactions in promoting T cell–dependent antibody responses in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2109991720,"Inflammation and trauma lead to enhanced pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia), which is in part due to altered sensory processing in the spinal cord. The synaptic hypothesis of hyperalgesia, which postulates that hyperalgesia is induced by the activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the spinal cord, has been challenged, because in previous studies of pain pathways, LTP was experimentally induced by nerve stimulation at high frequencies (∼100 hertz). This does not, however, resemble the real low-frequency afferent barrage that occurs during inflammation. We identified a synaptic amplifier at the origin of an ascending pain pathway that is switched-on by low-level activity in nociceptive nerve fibers. This model integrates known signal transduction pathways of hyperalgesia without contradiction."

The measurements also reveal that the respective cofragments (imidazolyl, pyrrolyl, and phenoxyl) are formed in very limited subsets of their available vibrational states. Identification of these product states yields uniquely detailed insights into the vibronic couplings involved in the photoinduced evolution from parent molecule to ultimate fragments."

https://openalex.org/W2021527318,"Negative-strand RNA viruses condense their genome into a helical nucleoprotein-RNA complex, the nucleocapsid, which is packed into virions and serves as a template for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex. The crystal structure of a recombinant rabies virus nucleoprotein-RNA complex, organized in an undecameric ring, has been determined at 3.5 angstrom resolution. Polymerization of the nucleoprotein is achieved by domain exchange between protomers, with flexible hinges allowing nucleocapsid formation. The two core domains of the nucleoprotein clamp around the RNA at their interface and shield it from the environment. RNA sequestering by nucleoproteins is likely a common mechanism used by negative-strand RNA viruses to protect their genomes from the innate immune response directed against viral RNA in human host cells at certain stages of an infectious cycle."

The RNA is tightly sequestered in a cavity at the interface between two lobes of the N protein. This serves to protect the RNA in the absence of polynucleotide synthesis. For the RNA to be accessed, some conformational change in the N protein should be necessary."

We report that the presence of Sle1 z / Sle1b z impairs B cell anergy, receptor revision, and deletion. Members of the SLAM costimulatory molecule family constitute prime candidates for Sle1b z , among which the Ly108.1 isoform of the Ly108 gene was most highly expressed in immature B cells from lupus-prone B6. Sle1 z mice. The normal Ly108.2 allele, but not the lupus-associated Ly108.1 allele, was found to sensitize immature B cells to deletion and RAG reexpression. As a potential regulator of tolerance checkpoints, Ly108 may censor self-reactive B cells, hence safeguarding against autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2113753544,"Coordinated control of energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis requires communication between organs and tissues. We identified a neuronal pathway that participates in the cross talk between the liver and adipose tissue. By studying a mouse model, we showed that adenovirus-mediated expression of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR)–g2 in the liver induces acute hepatic steatosis while markedly decreasing peripheral adiposity. These changes were accompanied by increased energy expenditure and improved systemic insulin sensitivity. Hepatic vagotomy and selective afferent blockage of the hepatic vagus revealed that the effects on peripheral tissues involve the afferent vagal nerve. Furthermore, an antidiabetic thiazolidinedione, a PPARg agonist, enhanced this pathway. This neuronal pathway from the liver may function to protect against metabolic perturbation induced by excessive energy storage."

We report here the results of stratigraphic investigations of a 1626-meter-thick sequence with interbedded wind-blown silt from the southern marginal Taklimakan Desert. Because the studied section is located downwind of the desert, the eolian silt accumulation is closely linked to desert formation. Our new evidence indicates that shifting sand dunes prevailed in the Tarim Basin by at least 5.3 million years ago, as they do today. We attribute this event to late Cenozoic climatic deterioration, as well as to changes in atmospheric circulation induced by Tibetan Plateau uplift."

https://openalex.org/W2026352963,"Ferritins play an essential role in iron homeostasis by sequestering iron in a bioavailable and non-toxic form. In plants, ferritin mRNAs are highly and quickly accumulated in response to iron overload. Such accumulation leads to a subsequent ferritin protein synthesis and iron storage, thus avoiding oxidative stress to take place. By combining pharmacological and imaging approaches in an Arabidopsis cell culture system, we have identified several elements in the signal transduction pathway leading to the increase of AtFer1 transcript level after iron treatment. Nitric oxide quickly accumulates in the plastids after iron treatment. This compound acts downstream of iron and upstream of a PP2A-type phosphatase to promote an increase of AtFer1 mRNA level. The AtFer1 gene transcription has been previously shown to be repressed under low iron conditions with the involvement of the cis-acting element iron-dependent regulatory sequence identified within the AtFer1 promoter sequence. We show here that the repressor is unlikely a transcription factor directly bound to the iron-dependent regulatory sequence; such a repressor is ubiquitinated upon iron treatment and subsequently degraded through a 26 S proteasome-dependent pathway.

As the major cofactor of proteins involved in essential processes like photosynthesis, respiration, DNA replication, or nitrogen fixation, iron is an essential element for life. Nonetheless, in the free ionic form, iron is toxic as it can catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species through the Fenton reaction. These reactive oxygen species damage the cell membranes, DNA, and proteins (1Guerinot M.L. Yi Y. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 2Noctor G. Foyer C.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 249-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4513) Google Scholar). Thus, iron homeostasis has to be tightly regulated, to avoid starvation that impairs the metabolism, and to avoid excess that may lead to cell death. Iron homeostasis is strongly dependent on ferritins, which are iron-storage proteins, found in bacteria, animals, and plants. Plant and animal ferritin structures are very similar, and are formed by 24 subunits arranged to form a hollow sphere able to sequester iron in a non-toxic and bioavailable form (3Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). In animals, ferritin synthesis is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level (3Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar, 4Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Ferritin mRNAs contain iron-responsive elements in their 5′-untranslated regions that function as binding sites for two related trans-acting factors, namely iron regulatory proteins IRP1 and IRP2. When bound to the iron-responsive element in the ferritin mRNA, the IRP inhibit translation of the transcript (4Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). IRP1 is a bifunctional protein that when iron is abundant possesses a 4Fe-4S cluster and acts as cytoplasmic aconitase. When iron levels are low, the 4Fe-4S cluster disassembles and the apoprotein acquires IRP 3The abbreviations used are: IRP, iron regulatory protein; cPTIO, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl-oxy-3-oxide; DAF-FM DA, 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate; IDRS, iron-dependent regulatory sequence; l-NMMA, NG-monomethyl-l-arginine; PP2A, protein phosphatase type 2A; OA, okadaic acid; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; NO, nitric oxide; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; NR, nitrate reductase; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; ABA, abscisic acid. activity, thus repressing ferritin translation. High levels of iron lead to the 4Fe-4S cluster reconstitution and therefore the protein aconitase activity. In contrast to IRP1, IRP2 cannot assemble a iron-sulfur cluster and lacks aconitase activity. IRP2 shares about 60% amino acid sequence identity with IRP1, but differs only in having a 73-amino acid insertion in its N-terminal region. This region contains a cysteine-rich sequence responsible for targeting the protein for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway when cellular iron level is high (5Iwai K. Klausner R.D.

Experiments based on serial deletions and site-directed mutagenesis of maize ZmFer1 and Arabidopsis AtFer1 ferritin promoter sequences allowed to identify a 15-bp cis-acting element necessary for the iron-dependent regulation of the transcription of these genes (18Petit J.M. van Wuytswinkel O. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5584-5590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This sequence, named IDRS, for iron-dependent regulatory sequence, has been shown to be involved in the repression of ZmFer1 and AtFer1 gene expression under iron-deficient conditions (18Petit J.M. van Wuytswinkel O. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5584-5590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Tarantino D. Petit J.M. Lobréaux S. Briat J.F. Soave C. Murgia I. Planta. 2003; 217: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, iron addition leads to the de-repression of ZmFer1 and AtFer1 gene expression rather than to their induction. Despite the growing number of physiological conditions reported to date leading to plant ferritin synthesis, little is known about the regulatory molecules acting downstream of iron. By using an Arabidopsis cell culture system, we show in this work that iron excess and oxidative stress, mimicked by exogenous H2O2 application, promote AtFer1 gene expression through two independent and additive pathways. We show also that iron application leads to a rapid NO burst in the plastids of the cell. This NO accumulation, which does not involve NOS1 nor nitrate reductase activities, is leading to AtFer1 de-repression. The factor that represses AtFer1 transcription under iron-deficient conditions is ubiquitinated and degraded by a 26 S proteasome-dependent pathway after iron application. This repressor is not a transcription factor directly bound to the IDRS present in the AtFer1 promoter region. Plant Cell Culture—Arabidopsis thaliana L. (Columbia ecotype) suspension cells were grown at 24 °C under continuous light (100 μEm–2 s–1) on a rotating table (60 rev/min) in a medium containing 20 mm KNO3, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 450 μm MgSO4, 375 μm KH2PO4, 60 μm Na2HPO4, 40 μm NaH2PO4, 40 μm MnSO4, 30 μm H3BO3, 25 μm glycine, 10 μm ZnSO4, 5 μm Fe(III)-EDTA, 4 μm nicotinic acid, 2.5 μm pyridoxine-HCl, 1.5 μm KI, 1.2 μm thiamine-HCl, 300 nm Na2MoO4, 100 nm ANA, 30 nm CoCl2, 30 nm CuSO4, 0.1 g liter–1 casein hydrolysate, 0.1 g liter–1 myo-inositol, 15 g liter–1 sucrose, pH 5.7. Cells were subcultured with a 1/10 dilution factor every 7 days. Experiments were carried out 1 week after subculture. Seeds from A. thaliana L. (Columbia ecotype), atnos1 (29Guo F.Q. Okamoto M.

Seeds were washed three times with ethanol and left to dry in sterile conditions. Seedlings were grown in 100 ml of half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (Sigma), pH 5.7, supplemented with 1% sucrose, 0.5 g liter–1 MES, and 50 μm Fe(III)-EDTA. After 1 week of culture at 24 °C under continuous light (100 μE m–2 s–1) and shaking (60 rpm), medium was discarded and replaced by 100 ml of fresh medium. Plants were grown 4 additional days in these conditions before treatments. Chemicals—One volume of a 100 mm FeSO4 stock solution in 0.06 m HCl was mixed with 1 volume of 200 mm Na3-citrate for a concentration of 50 mm FeSO4, 100 mm Na3-citrate. This mixture was used at final concentration of 300 μm FeSO4, 600 μm Na3-citrate in the culture medium. Except where indicated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Okadaic acid and cycloheximide were dissolved in ethanol and used at final concentrations of 250 nm and 100 μm, respectively. MG132 was dissolved in Me2SO and used at a final concentration of 50 μm. Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), cPTIO, l-NMMA, and SNP were dissolved in sterile water and used at final concentrations of 100 μm, and 1, 5, and 2.5 mm, respectively. After treatments, cells were filtered or plantlets were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Microscopy—NO imaging was performed by using 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM DA, Molecular Probes) dissolved in Me2SO at a stock concentration of 5 mm. For confocal laser-scanning microscopy, cells were loaded with 5 μm DAF-FM DA for 20 min. Then a solution containing 300 μm FeSO4, 600 μm Na3-citrate or 300 μm K2SO4, 600 μm Na3-citrate was added. The cell suspension (30 μl) was transferred on the slide. After overlaying by the glass cover, the slides were placed under the microscope, and the images were taken within 5 min on the same cells for each treatment. Settings and laser of the Zeiss Axiovert 100M inverted microscope were as described previously (31Huang X. Stettmaier K. Michel C. Hutzler P. Mueller M.J. Durner J. Planta. 2004; 218: 938-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Microscope, laser, and photomultiplier settings were held constant during the course of an experiment to obtain comparable data. Images were processed and analyzed using the Zeiss LSM 510 software.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA were loaded in each lane, separated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% (w/v) agarose/formaldehyde gel, and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham Biosciences). Hybridizations with 32P-labeled probes were performed overnight at 42 °C in the presence of 50% formamide (32Rosen K.M. Lamperti E.D. Villa-Komaroff L. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 398-403PubMed Google Scholar). After washes, filters were exposed for a few hours at –80 °C to Fuji Medical X-Ray film Super RX (Fujifilm) with an intensifying screen. AtFer1 mRNA relative abundance was determined by measuring hybridization signal intensities of AtFer1 and EF1α on the same blot. Quantifications were performed with the Imager Reader Bas-5000 software (Fuji). The AtFer1 mRNA relative abundance was defined as the ratio of AtFer1 and EF1α signal intensities. Protein Preparation and Analysis—Total protein extracts were prepared from 1 g of each sample as described (33Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to Schaffner and Weissmann (34Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on a 13% polyacrylamide, 0.1% SDS gel according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). After electro-blotting onto Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences), immunodetection of ferritin was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against purified AtFer1p (24Dellagi A. Rigault M. Segond D. Roux C. Kraepiel Y. Cellier F. Briat J.F. Gaymard F. Expert D. Plant J. 2005; 43: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the Aurora Western blotting kit (ICN) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Frozen cells (50 g) were ground in a Waring Blender in 300 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 25 mm Pipes, 5 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.0). The homogenates were filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem). Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 4,200 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, then were gently resuspended, and washed four times with homogenization buffer with subsequent centrifugations at 2,000 × g for 10 min, then at 1,500 × g for 10, 8, and 6 min. Nuclei were resuspended in a minimum volume of freezing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μgml–1 leupeptin, and 50 μg ml–1 antipain, 50% glycerol, pH 7.6), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Nuclear extracts were prepared by thawing nuclei on ice and lysing by adjusting the NaCl concentration to 0.47 m with lysing buffer (2.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μgml–1 leupeptin, 50 μg ml–1 antipain, 20% glycerol, pH 7.6), and then shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. Chromatin was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant containing nuclear proteins was dialyzed for 4 h against dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 40 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, pH 7.6). Nuclear proteins were concentrated with centrifugal filter devices (Amicon, Ultracel 10k). Protein concentration was determined according to Schaffner and Weissmann (34Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Nuclear extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. DNA Probes and Labeling Reactions—The specific probe used for AtFer1 detection consists in a chimeric fragment containing the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the AtFer1 cDNA. The 5′-untranslated region was amplified with thermostable Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) using primers 5′-GGTACCTATATAAACCCTTCCTCCTTCC-3′ and 5′-GAATTCCATCGGCATGTTGTTTGTGTCC-3′ introducing KpnI and EcoRI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified fragment, respectively. The 3′-untranslated region was amplified using primers 5′-GAACTAGAATTCGACCTCTATAAG-3′ and 5′-TAGAAACTAGTAAAACAAAAACTTCATTG-3′ introducing EcoRI and SpeI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified fragment, respectively. The fragments were cloned at the corresponding sites in pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. The specific probe (469 bp) was obtained by digesting the resulting construct by KpnI and SpeI. The EF1α probe (550 bp) was obtained by amplification with the Pfu DNA polymerase on the EF1α cDNA using the forward 5′-CCACCACTGGTGGTTTTGAGGCTGGTATC-3′ and reverse 5′-CATTGAACCCAACGTTGTCACCTGGAAG-3′ primers. The resulting fragment was cloned at the EcoRV site of pBluescript and sequenced. The probe was obtained after digestion of the plasmid with BamHI and HindIII. The fragments were purified on agarose gel prior to labeling. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with the use of Prime-a-Gene Labeling kit (Promega). For the gel shift experiments, DNA probes were amplified from genomic DNA with Pfu DNA polymerase and different primers introducing a BamHI site at the 5′ end of the amplified fragment and a XhoI site at the 3′ end. Amplified fragments were cloned in pBluescript at the corresponding sites and sequenced. For probes A, B, C, and D (see the location of the amplified fragments on Fig. 6), the primer located at the 5′ end of the amplified fragment is 5′-GGATCCGAGCGAGTAGGAAATA-3′. At the 3′ ends, the primers were 5′-CTCGAGAAAGGCGTGTGGTCACCGTTGG-3′,5′-CTCGAGCCGTTGGATTGAGATCC-3′,5′-CTCGAGTGGATATGAAAGCCAGATGT-3′, and 5′-CTCGAGGATAGTGTGAACTGTGAG-3′ for probes A, B, C, and D, respectively. The probe E was obtained with primers 5′-GGATCCCAGATTTACACGTCTAACTT-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGCATCTCTCCAAATAAAGTTTGTCC-3′. For labeling and competitions, the fragments were obtained by digestion of the corresponding plasmids by BamHI and XhoI and subsequent purification on agarose gel. For labeling, 100 ng of DNA was introduced in a medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg ml–1 bovine serum albumin, dATP, dGTP, dTTP (600 μm each), 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP and 10 units of Klenow fragment. After 30 min at room temperature, DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. After a 15-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, the pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol, dried, and re-suspended in 50 μl of water. Specific activity of the probe was determined by scintillation counting, and the probe was diluted to 20,000 cpm/μl. Mobility Shift Assay—The mobility shift reaction was done in a volume of 30 μl using 1 μl of 32P-labeled DNA fragment, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5 μg of nuclear protein in the fixation buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, 70 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol, pH 7.6). The binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature prior to loading reactions onto 6% polyacrylamide non-denaturing gel in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0. The gel was run at 120 Vin45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, buffer for ∼6 h. After migration, the gel was dried during 2 h under vacuum at 80 °C and exposed for a few hours at –80 °C to Fuji Medical X-Ray film Super RX (Fujifilm). For the binding competition assays, a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled fragments was included in the reaction. Iron and H2O2 Increase AtFer1 mRNA Abundance by Two Independent and Additive Pathways—Both maize ZmFer1 and Arabidopsis AtFer1 ferritin mRNA accumulates in response to iron treatment. This response, dependent of the cis-acting element IDRS (18Petit J.M. van Wuytswinkel O. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5584-5590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), is antagonized by antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine and GSH (20Gaymard F. Boucherez J. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), indicating that an oxidative step is involved in the pathway leading to the iron-dependent ferritin mRNA increase in abundance. Furthermore, it has been previously reported that H2O2 treatment increases maize ZmFer1 and Arabidopsis AtFer1 mRNA abundance (21Petit J.M. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Savino G. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33319-33326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It can therefore be hypothesized that H2O2 could act in the iron/IDRS-dependent pathway, and this is the first point we analyzed. We checked whether H2O2 treatment could mimic the potential oxidative effect of iron overload. Arabidopsis cell cultures were treated either with 300 μm iron-citrate, 5 mm H2O2, or with both inducers. Above 300 μm iron-citrate or 5 mm H2O2, no significant difference in AtFer1 mRNA abundance was observed (data not shown). Cells were harvested at different time points from 1 to 48 h. Total RNA was purified and subjected to Northern analysis for determining AtFer1 mRNA abundance (Fig. 1A). In response to iron treatment, the AtFer1 steady state mRNA level increased 1 h after iron application, reached a maximum after 3 to 6 h of treatment, and decreased. This result is in accordance with those obtained with Arabidopsis plantlets (20Gaymard F. Boucherez J. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Petit J.M. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The AtFer1 mRNA abundance was also increased after H2O2 treatment, but with a different time course; the maximum level of transcript was observed 12 h after H2O2 treatment, and AtFer1 mRNA was barely detectable after 24 h (Fig. 1A). AtFer1 mRNA abundance after cotreatment with both effectors was compared with the effect of iron or H2O2 applied alone. AtFer1 mRNA abundance was normalized relatively to the EF1α mRNA abundance. As shown on Fig. 1B, the addition of both effectors led to a signal intensity quite close to the sum of the values obtained with iron or H2O2 applied alone. This result indicates that iron and H2O2 are acting in two independent and additive pathways leading to AtFer1 mRNA accumulation. However, addition of iron could cause the production of a certain amount of H2O2, potentially leading to a further AtFer1 mRNA accumulation. Such an hypothesis is unlikely because when cells were treated with catalase prior to iron addition, no change in AtFer1 mRNA accumulation was observed compared with catalase untreated cells (Fig. 1C). At the protein level, ferritin was accumulated after 24 h of iron treatment. It was also accumulated at the same time point after H2O2 treatment, but to a lower extend. Co-treatment with iron and H2O2 led to a ferritin protein accumulation to a level close to the one that was observed in response to iron treatment (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we have tested the effect of okadaic acid (OA) on AtFer1 mRNA abundance in response to iron excess or H2O2 treatments. It has to be reminded that OA has been shown to antagonize maize ZmFer1 gene expression both in response to iron excess and H2O2 treatment. When Arabidopsis cells were treated with OA, iron-induced AtFer1 mRNA abundance was decreased, whereas H2O2-induced mRNA abundance was increased (Fig. 1D). This indicates that a PP2A-type phosphatase is a positive regulator of the iron pathway and a negative regulator of the H2O2 pathway. This result enforces the hypothesis of independent pathways. Although we cannot rule out that reactive oxygen species other than H2O2 could be involved in the increase of AtFer1 mRNA abundance, it is more likely that the response is specific to H2O2 because catalase addition prior to H2O2 treatment abolished AtFer1 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 1C). Our main goal being to decipher the iron- and IDRS-dependent pathway, we further investigate only the response of AtFer1 gene to iron treatment. An Iron-induced Plastidial NO Burst Precedes AtFer1 mRNA Accumulation—Several reports have involved nitric oxide in the control of iron homeostasis and in AtFer1 regulation (26Murgia I. de Pinto M.C.

NO was shown to be involved in iron- and IDRS-dependent AtFer1 regulation (26Murgia I. de Pinto M.C. Delledonne M. Soave C. De Gara L. J.

SNP (a NO donor) induced an AtFer1 mRNA abundance increase and cPTIO (a NO scavenger) antagonized iron-induced AtFer1 mRNA accumulation. We have first examined whether iron treatment may lead to a NO production in the cells by using the NO-sensitive fluorescent probe DAF-FM DA. Cells were incubated for 20 min with the probe before the application of treatments. NO production was visualized using a confocal microscope (Fig. 2). The iron-citrate treatment led to a very rapid increase of the fluorescence. A clear signal was detected 5 min"
https://openalex.org/W2146317714,"Autotaxin (ATX, nucleotide pyrophosphate/phosphodiesterase-2) is an autocrine motility factor initially characterized from A2058 melanoma cell-conditioned medium. ATX is known to contribute to cancer cell survival, growth, and invasion. Recently ATX was shown to be responsible for the lysophospholipase D activity that generates lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Production of LPA is sufficient to explain the effects of ATX on tumor cells. Cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) is a naturally occurring analog of LPA in which the <i>sn</i>-2 hydroxy group forms a 5-membered ring with the <i>sn</i>-3 phosphate. Cellular responses to cPA generally oppose those of LPA despite activation of apparently overlapping receptor populations, suggesting that cPA also activates cellular targets distinct from LPA receptors. cPA has previously been shown to inhibit tumor cell invasion <i>in vitro</i> and cancer cell metastasis <i>in vivo</i>. However, the mechanism governing this effect remains unresolved. Here we show that 3-carba analogs of cPA lack significant agonist activity at LPA receptors yet are potent inhibitors of ATX activity, LPA production, and A2058 melanoma cell invasion <i>in vitro</i> and B16F10 melanoma cell metastasis <i>in vivo</i>."

Polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the N terminus of Htt causes the neurodegenerative disorder Huntington disease (HD). The cytotoxicity of mutant Htt is modulated by proteolytic cleavage with caspases and calpains generating N-terminal polyQ-containing fragments. We hypothesized that phosphorylation of Htt may modulate cleavage and cytotoxicity. In the present study, we have mapped the major phosphorylation sites of Htt using cell culture models (293T and PC12 cells) expressing full-length myc-tagged Htt constructs containing 23Q or 148Q repeats. Purified myc-tagged Htt was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and nano-HPLC tandem mass spectrometry, used in conjunction with on-target alkaline phosphatase and protease digestions. We have identified more than six novel serine phosphorylation sites within Htt, one of which lies in the proteolytic susceptibility domain. Three of the sites have the consensus sequence for ERK1 phosphorylation, and addition of ERK1 inhibitor blocks phosphorylation at those sites. Other observed phosphorylation sites are possibly substrates for CDK5/CDC2 kinases. Mutation of amino acid Ser-536, which is located in the proteolytic susceptibility domain, to aspartic acid, inhibited calpain cleavage and reduced mutant Htt toxicity.

Under non-pathological conditions, this stretch of glutamines ranges from 2 to 34 repeats. Repeat lengths of 36 or greater cause HD. The threshold of polyQ length for Htt aggregation is quite similar to the threshold for disease suggesting that a conformational change in Htt triggers the disease. However, it should be pointed out that the aggregates forming inclusions are not likely toxic themselves (2Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Htt is a protein with 3144 amino acids with a molecular mass of ∼350 kDa. Its function and regulation are incompletely understood. Upon polyQ expansion in the N terminus of Htt, a conformationally altered protein is produced. Structural predictions suggest that Htt is composed of four HH-HEAT domains with two unstructured proteolytic susceptibility domains (these areas contain PEST sequence) (Fig. 1). In addition Htt harbors a potential nuclear localization signal at the end of the second HH2 domain and a confirmed nuclear export signal in the third HH3 domain (3Xia J. Lee D.H. Taylor J. Vandelft M. Truant R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Posttranslational modifications, especially phosphorylation and proteolytic cleavage, may facilitate the initial conversion of Htt from a normal to an abnormal conformation, and may be initiating steps in a pathogenic cascade. Thus understanding how Htt is posttranslationally modified in the context of polyQ expansion may give us insight into HD pathogenesis. Some posttranslational modifications of Htt have been described, such as ubiquination (4Kalchman M.A. Graham R.K. Xia G. Koide H.B. Hodgson J.G. Graham K.C. Goldberg Y.P. Gietz R.D. Pickart C.M.

Systematic analysis of phosphorylation or other types of modifications of Htt protein and its consequences for Htt biochemistry and function have not previously been described.

A matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (33 mm) in ACN/methanol (Agilent Technologies) was used for MALDI-MS experiments. For vMALDI-MS/MS, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (LaserBio Labs) in 50% ACN was used as matrix. Cell Culture and Transfection—Full-length Htt constructs with polyQ repeats of either 23Q or 148Q (pTet-c-myc-FL23Q and pTet-c-myc-FL148Q) were generated containing N-terminal c-myc epitopes (pTet-splice vector, Invitrogen) (16Tanaka Y. Igarashi S. Nakamura M. Gafni J. Torcassi C. Schilling G. Crippen D. Wood J.D. Sawa A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Borchelt D.R. Ellerby L.M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 21: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). pTet-c-myc-FL23Q and pTet-c-myc-FL148Q were transfected into 293T cells (10-cm plate, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum with Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions). Cells were harvested 48–72 h after transfection. In addition, a stable inducible PC12 cell model expressing full-length Htt (pTet-c-myc-FL148Q) was established as previously described (18Igarashi S. Morita H. Bennett K.M. Tanaka Y. Engelender S. Peters M.F. Cooper J.K. Wood J.D. Sawa A. Ross C.A. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 100 μg/ml G418, 200 μg/ml hygromycin, 200 ng/ml doxycycline, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Full-length Htt148Q was expressed by removal of doxycycline. Cells used to obtain Htt for mass spectrometric analysis were cultured under conditions of differentiation in the presence of nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml) and low serum (0.5% fetal bovine serum, 1% horse serum) for 8 days in the absence of doxycycline. Cells were cultured in serum-free media for 24 h prior to harvesting to reduce protein contamination for mass spectrometric analysis. Kinase Inhibitor Studies—Kinase inhibitors U0126 (10 and 50 μm, Cell Signaling) and roscovitine (25, 100, and 200 μm, Calbiochem) were solubilized in Me2SO (Sigma) and added to cells 24 h after transfection for 24 h. Cells were treated with Me2SO as a control. Similarly, lithium chloride (5, 25 mm) was added to cells with sodium chloride utilized as a control. Cells were harvested by scraping and centrifugation at 500 × g. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis on cell lysates were carried out as described below. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of Htt constructs was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: serine at amino acid 1201 was converted to an alanine, forward, 5′-CAAGCATCTGTACCGTTGGCTCCCAAGAAAGGCAGTGAGG-3′, reverse, 5′-CCTCACTGCCTTTCTTGGGAGCCAACGGTACAGATGCTTG-3′; serine at amino acid 536 was converted to aspartic acid, forward 5′-GGATATCTTGAGCCACAGCGACAGCCAGGTCAGCGCCGTCC-3′, reverse, 5′-GGACGGCGCTGACCTGGCTGTCGCTGTGGCTCAAGATATCC-3′; serine at amino acid 535 was converted to aspartic acid, forward, 5′GGAGGATATCTTGAGCCACGACTCCAGCCAGGTCAGCGCCG-3′, reverse, 5′-CGGCGCTGACCTGGCTGGAGTCGTGGCTCAAGATATCCTCC-3′; and serine at amino acid 533 was converted to an aspartic acid, forward, 5′-GGATGAGGAGGATATCTTGGACCACAGCTCCAGCCAGGTCAG-3′, reverse, 5′-CTGACCTGGCTGGAGCTGTGGTCCAAGATATCCTCCTCATCC-3′. PCR was performed using 50 ng of DNA, 5 μl of 10× Pfu buffer (Stratagene), 0.2 mm dNTPs (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 125 ng each of forward and reverse primers (Integrated DNA Technologies), 5% Me2SO (Sigma), and 1 μlpf Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) at 96 °C for 1 min, 18 cycles at 96 °C for 50 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 24 or 45 min, and 68 °C for 7 or 10 min. Plasmids were DpnI (Stratagene)-treated, transformed into XL1-Blue Supercompetent cells (Stratagene), and purified using the Qiagen Plasmid Mini Kit. Mutations, CAG repeat length, and construct integrity were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutated constructs of different amino acid length were generated (Htt residues 1–1212 and full-length Htt including a myc tag), and expressed as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Harvested cells were lysed with M-PER (Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent, Pierce) or RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% SDOC, 1% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors (Mini Complete, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were sonicated and then spun to remove debris (16,000 × g, 20 min). Protein concentration was determined with the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Htt was immunoprecipitated overnight from cell lysates (500–2000 μg) using the ProFound Mammalian C-myc Tag IP/Co-IP kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol with a final wash in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, to remove excess salt and elution Protocol 2 with 25 μl of non-reducing sample buffer (0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 50% glycerol, dye). Immunoprecipitated sample (3 μl for Western blot analysis or 22 μl for mass spectrometric analysis) was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) in MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen) for 1.5 h at 200 V. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) or Optitran BA-S nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) typically for 14 h at 20 volts at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) (for serine phospho-specific antibodies) or 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 and probed overnight with polyclonal or monoclonal N-terminal Htt BKP1 (1:500), polyclonal c-myc (Upstate, 1:1000), or monoclonal anti-phospho-Ser-Pro (16B4) and anti-phospho-Ser (1C8) antibody (Chemicon, 1:100). Secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1:3000, Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare) was applied for 1 h at room temperature. ECL (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare) was used for detection. For mass spectrometric analysis, SDS gels were fixed with 10% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 30 min and then stained with Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) followed by destaining in 10% methanol, 7% acetic acid. In-gel Proteolytic Digestion of Proteins—Proteins were digested manually to maximize sensitivity and efficiency. Protein bands were destained and dehydrated with ACN. Subsequently, proteins were reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at 56 °C for 1 h and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at room temperature for 45 min. For chymotrypsin digestion, 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 25 mm NH4HCO3 was used in the reduction step to fully digest Htt in the gel. Samples were incubated overnight with trypsin (125 ng, 37 °C), chymotrypsin (200 ng, 25 °C), or Asp-N (100–200 ng, 37 °C). The resulting proteolytic peptides were subjected to aqueous (100 μl H2O, sonication, 10 min) and hydrophobic extraction (50 μl of 50% ACN, 5% formic acid), and analyzed by mass spectrometry after concentration under vacuum to a 10–15-μl final volume. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra of digested protein gel bands were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Voyager DESTR plus instrument (Applied Biosystems) and proteolytic peptide extracts were analyzed by reverse-phase nano-HPLC-MS/MS with an Ultimate HPLC (Dionex) connected to a QSTAR Pulsar I quadrupole orthogonal TOF mass spectrometer (MDS Sciex) as previously described (19Schilling B.

In addition, peptides obtained from Htt were analyzed by vacuum MALDI-MS, MS/MS, and MS3 on a vMALDI-LTQ™ linear ion trap (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). For these experiments, samples were analyzed first by MS/MS for the neutral loss of phosphoric acid (98 Da) (17Chang E.J. Archambault V. McLachlin D.T. Krutchinsky A.N. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 4472-4483Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Peptides showing this neutral loss were interrogated further by MS3 by selecting the (M + H – 98)+ peak as precursor. For further experimental detail using vMALDI-MSn for phosphopeptide analysis see the supplementary materials and previous reports (17Chang E.J. Archambault V. McLachlin D.T. Krutchinsky A.N.

Chem. 2001; 73: 5066-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Phosphatase Treatment—Proteolyzed Htt samples were subjected to phosphatase treatment. Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (1 μl, New England Biolabs) in 50 mm NH4CO3, pH 8.0, was added on top of the dried analyte/matrix MALDI spot for 1 h at 37 °C as described in Ref. 22Larsen M.R. Sorensen G.L. Fey S.J. Larsen P.M. Roepstorff P. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar. After incubation, 1 μl of matrix was added to recrystallize the sample. Alternatively, aliquots of the Htt digestions were incubated in solution with 1 μl of alkaline phosphatase for 1–2 h in the presence of NE Buffer 3 (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9). Samples were subsequently analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Bioinformatics and Protein Data Base Searches—Mass spectrometric data were analyzed with the bioinformatics data base system RADARS (Genomic Solutions) (23Field H.I. Fenyo D. Beavis R.C. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), Mascot (Matrix Sciences, London) (24Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6819) Google Scholar), and Sequest (25Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5476) Google Scholar). Routinely, MALDI-MS data were analyzed with RADARS using the search engine ProFound for PMF, matching against peptides from known protein sequences as previously described (20Schilling B. Bharath M.M.S. Row R.H. Murray J. Cusack M.P. Capaldi R.A. Freed C.R. Prasad K.N. Andersen J.K. Gibson B.W. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 84-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For ESI-MS/MS data sets, tandem mass spectra were submitted to the in-house licensed data base search engine Mascot (version 2.1) (Matrix Sciences). A custom-designed protein data base for human full-length Htt protein was constructed and incorporated into Mascot that could be searched more exhaustively for extended sequence coverage and identification of a more complete set of posttranslational modifications. To extract and compile peak lists from ESI-MS data generated during an LC-MS/MS run, Mascot Distiller (1.1.1) and Distiller MDRO Software Developer's Package (Matrix Sciences) were used in conjunction with an in-house Java program, “MS-Assign” (20Schilling B. Bharath M.M.S. Row R.H. Murray J. Cusack M.P. Capaldi R.A. Freed C.R. Prasad K.N. Andersen J.K. Gibson B.W. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 84-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore the generated ESI-MS peak lists were submitted to the Mascot search engine for PMF analysis at a mass accuracy of ±50 ppm. MALDI-MSn data were searched using Sequest (for details see Supplement). A Java program was developed in-house, “SeqDisp,” to graphically display the observed protein sequence coverage of peptides obtained from ESI-MS/MS, ESI-MS, and MALDI-MS data. Toxicity Measurements—Caspase activity was measured using the ApoAlert Caspase-3 Fluorescent Assay Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as described in our previous work (15Gafni J. Hermel E. Young J.E. Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Ellerby L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20211-20220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Htt Is Constitutively Phosphorylated—Htt is a challenging protein to analyze for posttranslational modifications with a molecular mass of ∼350 kDa (3144 amino acid residues) and long polyQ stretches that are susceptible to aggregation. Furthermore, human full-length Htt contains 307 serine residues, 170 threonine residues, and 62 tyrosine residues, many of which have predicted kinase consensus sequence motifs (Table 1).TABLE 1Predicted phosphorylation sites in human HttSequencePositionScorePrediction percentileKinaseaKinase sites searched and abbreviations: AKT1, Akt kinase; PRKCA, protein kinase α/β/γ; PRKCM, protein kinase μ; CSNK2B, casein kinase 2; GSK3A, glycogen synthase kinase 3; CDK5, Cdk5 kinase; CDC2, Cdc2 kinase; EPHB2, ERK1 kinase; YWHAZ, 14-3-3 mode; FRG, FGR kinase; ITK, Itk Src homology domain 3; CRK, Crk Src homology domain 3; FYN, Fyn Src homology domain 2; PRKACG, protein kinase A; PRKCE, protein kinase ϵ.Basophilic serine/threonine kinase group (Baso_ST_kin)GGRSRSGSIVELIAGSer-4210.37420.030%AKT1NLKSSSPTIRRTAAGThr-2670.39500.167%PRKCAAHLLKNMSHCRQPSDSer-6360.40760.126%PRKCMLDRFRLSTMQDSLSPThr-20680.44760.104%AKT1TSTTRALTFGCCEALThr-10240.48170.180%AKT1Acidophilic serine/threonine kinase group (Acid_ST_kin)LVMEQEESPPEEDTESer-24890.38430.130%CSNK2BASSPPTSPVNSRKHSer-26570.40470.043%GSK3AKAALPSLTNPPSLSPThr-11750.46330.146%GSK3AMQDSLSPSPPVSSHPSer-20760.47590.184%GSK3AProline-dependent serine/threonine kinase group (Pro_ST-kin)EVVAAPGSPYHRLLTSer-31260.32670.054%CDK5LTNPPSLSPIRRKGKSer-11810.33430.062%CDK5WWAEVQQTPKRHLSLThr-18590.34830.080%CDK5EVVAAPGSPYHRLLTSer-31260.35310.034%CDC2EQASVPLSPKKGSEASer-12010.37180.122%CDK5LTNPPSLSPIRRKGKSer-11810.37660.054%CDC2QPGEQLLSPERRTNTSer-23300.39970.194%CDK5ADAPAPSSPPTSPVNSer-26530.43140.124%EPHB2EQASVPLSPKKGSEASer-12010.44380.195%CDC2STMQDSLSPSPPVSSSer-20740.44860.171%EPHB2Phospho-serine/threonine binding group (sST_bind)ESGGRSRSGSIVELISer-4190.44730.712%YWHAZVTTSKSSSLGSFYHLSer-12280.45440.777%YWHAZEFIYRINTLGWTSRTThr-24570.45750.807%YWHAZPhosphotyrosine binding group (Y_kin)LDGTDNQYLGLQIGOTyr-5920.40560.356%FGRGALHGVLYVLECDLLTyr-27900.44950.972%ITKESFFSKLYKVPLDTTTyr-7370.41600.293%CRKPRLQLELYKEIKKNGTyr-1730.45870.546%FYNProtein kinase A, PKC ϵTRFGRKLSIIRGIVESer-25500.36270.258%PRKACGQQTPKRHSLSSTKLLSer-18640.42730.557%PRKACGAPKSLRSSWASEEEASer-11100.43110.569%PRKCEAALGMLTCMYTGKEThr-29260.44780.366%PRKCMa Kinase sites searched and abbreviations: AKT1, Akt kinase; PRKCA, protein kinase α/β/γ; PRKCM, protein kinase μ; CSNK2B, casein kinase 2; GSK3A, glycogen synthase kinase 3; CDK5, Cdk5 kinase; CDC2, Cdc2 kinase; EPHB2, ERK1 kinase; YWHAZ, 14-3-3 mode; FRG, FGR kinase; ITK, Itk Src homology domain 3; CRK, Crk Src homology domain 3; FYN, Fyn Src homology domain 2; PRKACG, protein kinase A; PRKCE, protein kinase ϵ. Open table in a new tab In the present study, we expressed myc-tagged human full-length Htt constructs containing 23 and 148 polyQ repeats in 293T or PC12 cells. Htt23Q or Htt148Q cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using a myc tag antibody and subsequently subjected to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE or Western blot analysis. Western blots of immunoprecipitated Htt23Q and Htt148Q were probed with different antibodies as shown in Fig. 2. The N-terminal Htt antibody BKP1 revealed immunoreactivity for Htt23Q and Htt148Q migrating at a molecular mass corresponding to the theoretical molecular mass of full-length Htt of ∼350 kDa (Fig. 2A). In addition, an anti-phospho-Ser-Pro antibody (16B4) was used that specifically recognizes phosphorylated serines that are adjacent to a proline residue. Htt23Q and Htt148Q were immunoreactive to this antibody (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3) indicating that Htt was phosphorylated by proline-directed serine kinases. Htt23Q and Htt148Q were immunoreactive to an anti-phospho-Ser (1C8) antibody as well. This is a monoclonal antibody immunoreactive to a broad range of serine-phosphorylated proteins, preferring positively charged amino acids directly neighboring the phosphoserine residues (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3). These results suggest that we were able to isolate full-length human Htt that is endogenously phosphorylated by several different kinases during protein expression and these posttranslational modifications are constitutively present in Htt. Htt Is Constitutively Phosphorylated by MEK1 Kinases—Kinase inhibitor studies were performed to determine which group of kinases might be involved in Htt phosphorylation. 293T cells expressing Htt23Q and Htt148Q were treated with kinase inhibitors U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor), roscovitine (CDK5 inhibitor), and lithium chloride (GSK3 inhibitor). MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, decreased the overall level of Htt phosphorylation as detected by Western blots probed with an anti-phospho-Ser-Pro antibody (Fig. 3). Studies with roscovitine and lithium chloride, also using Western blot analysis and phosphoserine antibodies, were inconclusive. This is most likely due to the presence of several other abundant phosphorylation sites that are not affected by these kinase inhibitors (data not shown). Immunopurification of Htt for Mass Spectrometry—To determine the unique sites of phosphorylation within Htt by mass spectrometry, we optimized the immunopurification of Htt using several different cell lysis buffers (Fig. 3; see “Experimental Procedures”). Htt was immunoprecipitated from relatively large amounts of starting material (500–2000 μg of cell lysate per immunoprecipitation) from either 293T or PC12 cells. After release of Htt from the myc tag antibody, the proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and stained with the fluorescent dye Sypro Ruby (Fig. 4). Microgram quantities of Htt were obtained, sufficient for our analysis of post-translational modifications by mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometric Characterization of Fu"
https://openalex.org/W2133606327,"Three-dimensional specimens of the volant fossil bird Gansus yumenensis from the Early Cretaceous Xiagou Formation of northwestern China demonstrate that this taxon possesses advanced anatomical features previously known only in Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic ornithuran birds. Phylogenetic analysis recovers Gansus within the Ornithurae, making it the oldest known member of the clade. The Xiagou Formation preserves the oldest known ornithuromorph-dominated avian assemblage. The anatomy of Gansus , like that of other non-neornithean (nonmodern) ornithuran birds, indicates specialization for an amphibious life-style, supporting the hypothesis that modern birds originated in aquatic or littoral niches."
https://openalex.org/W2047754014,"The dynamical and physical properties of asteroids offer one of the few constraints on the formation, evolution, and migration of the giant planets. Trojan asteroids share a planet's semimajor axis but lead or follow it by about 60° near the two triangular Lagrangian points of gravitational equilibrium. Here we report the discovery of a high-inclination Neptune Trojan, 2005 TN 53 . This discovery demonstrates that the Neptune Trojan population occupies a thick disk, which is indicative of “freeze-in” capture instead of in situ or collisional formation. The Neptune Trojans appear to have a population that is several times larger than the Jupiter Trojans. Our color measurements show that Neptune Trojans have statistically indistinguishable slightly red colors, which suggests that they had a common formation and evolutionary history and are distinct from the classical Kuiper Belt objects."
https://openalex.org/W2130246821,"Colicin M was earlier demonstrated to provoke Escherichia coli cell lysis via inhibition of cell wall peptidoglycan (murein) biosynthesis. As the formation of the O-antigen moiety of lipopolysaccharides was concomitantly blocked, it was hypothesized that the metabolism of undecaprenyl phosphate, an essential carrier lipid shared by these two pathways, should be the target of this colicin. However, the exact target and mechanism of action of colicin M was unknown. Colicin M was now purified to near homogeneity, and its effects on cell wall peptidoglycan metabolism reinvestigated. It is demonstrated that colicin M exhibits both in vitro and in vivo enzymatic properties of degradation of lipid I and lipid II peptidoglycan intermediates. Free undecaprenol and either 1-pyrophospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide or 1-pyrophospho-MurNAc-(pentapeptide)-Glc-NAc were identified as the lipid I and lipid II degradation products, respectively, showing that the cleavage occurred between the lipid moiety and the pyrophosphoryl group. This is the first time such an activity is described. Neither undecaprenyl pyrophosphate nor the peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors were substrates of colicin M, indicating that both undecaprenyl and sugar moieties were essential for activity. The bacteriolytic effect of colicin M therefore appears to be the consequence of an arrest of peptidoglycan polymerization steps provoked by enzymatic degradation of the undecaprenyl phosphate-linked peptidoglycan precursors.

Colicins are plasmid-encoded toxins, synthesized and released in the growth medium by Escherichia coli, which kill susceptible E. coli strains and closely related bacterial species (1Pugsley A.P.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains are protected against the colicin they produce by concomitant expression of a highly specific immunity protein. The lethal action of colicins can be divided into three steps: binding to a specific outer membrane receptor protein, translocation through the cell envelope, and finally interaction with the target and killing effect. To each of these steps corresponds a specific protein domain, the different colicins showing a similar three-domain structural organization. Depending on the import pathway they parasitize to enter the cells, the Tol system or the TonB system, colicins are classified into two groups A and B, respectively (3Lazdunski C.J. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mode of action of colicins is variable: formation of voltage-gated pores in the cytoplasmic membrane (e.g. colicins A, B, E1, Ia, N), inhibition of protein synthesis (e.g. colicins D and E3), enzymatic degradation of cellular DNA or 16S rRNA (e.g. colicin E2) and inhibition of cell envelope biosynthesis (colicin M, see below). Various bacterial cell envelope polysaccharides (peptidoglycan, O-antigen, teichoic acid, capsular polysaccharide) in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have a lipid-linked intermediary stage in their biosynthesis that is dependent on the essential carrier lipid undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P) 4The abbreviations used are: C55-P, undecaprenyl phosphate; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; C55-PP, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate; C55-OH, undecaprenol; PP, pyrophosphoryl; A2pm, diaminopimelic acid; lipid I, C55-PP-MurNAc-pentapeptide; lipid II, C55-PP-MurNAc-(pentapeptide)-GlcNAc; Ni2+-NTA-agarose, nickel-nitrilotriacetate-agarose; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.

In the peptidoglycan pathway, this lipid is needed for the synthesis and transport of hydrophilic GlcNAc-MurNAc-peptide monomeric motifs across the cytoplasmic membrane to the external sites of polymerization. In other pathways, it can serve as an acceptor for oligosaccharide repeating units or, in some cases, possibly for completed polymers. C55-P is generated from the dephosphorylation of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C55-PP), which itself is the product of eight sequential condensations of isopentenyl pyrophosphate with farnesyl pyrophosphate, a reaction catalyzed by the C55-PP synthase UppS (16Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kato J. Fujisaki S. Nakajima K. Nishimura Y. Sato M. Nakano A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2733-2738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several integral membrane proteins exhibiting a C55-PP phosphatase (UppP) activity were recently identified in E. coli (18El Ghachi M.

Only the inactivation of these multiple genes was lethal and therefore required to completely deplete cells of the latter essential activity (19El Ghachi M. Derbise A. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18689-18695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). C55-P phosphatase and undecaprenol kinase activities that catalyzed the interconversion of C55-P into undecaprenol (C55-OH) were also earlier detected and purified from extracts of some Gram-positive bacteria but their genes have not been identified to date (20Higashi Y.

In the metabolism of C55-P, the dephosphorylation of C55-PP is the target of bacitracin, a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic which acts by sequestration of the C55-PP substrate (24Storm D.R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3940-3945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Siewert G. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was earlier hypothesized that the same step could also be the target of colicin M (27Harkness R.E. Braun V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6177-6182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a class B colicin requiring the outer membrane protein FhuA as a receptor (28Pilsl H. Glaser C. Gross P. Killmann H. Olschlager T. Braun V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Kock J. Olschlager T. Kamp R.M. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3358-3361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Braun V. Schaller K. Wolff H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 323: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Colicin M exhibits a unique mode of action as it is the only colicin known to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis and cause cell lysis (31Schaller K. Höltje J.V. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was shown to also interfere with lipopolysaccharide O-antigen synthesis (32Harkness R.E. Braun V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14716-14722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an inhibition of a common step shared by the two pathways. As the C55-P carrier lipid is required in both processes, Harkness and Braun (32Harkness R.E. Braun V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14716-14722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) earlier hypothesized that the synthesis or recycling of this compound could be the target of colicin M. To identify the step of peptidoglycan synthesis blocked by colicin M, these authors analyzed the distribution of radiolabeled diaminopimelic acid (A2pm) in pulse-labeled colicin-treated cultures of E. coli and they observed an accumulation of the soluble peptidoglycan precursors (mainly UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) and the depletion of the pools of the two lipid intermediates I and II. It was thus concluded that colicin M acted by preventing the regeneration of the lipid carrier but the exact mechanism of action remained unknown and whether this inhibition was direct (e.g. inhibition of C55-PP phosphatase) or indirect was not determined (27Harkness R.E. Braun V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6177-6182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present article, the effects of colicin M on peptidoglycan metabolism were reinvestigated. Colicin M was shown to exhibit both in vitro and in vivo enzymatic properties of degradation of the lipid I and lipid II peptidoglycan intermediates. The depletion of the pools of these precursors results in an inhibition of peptidoglycan polymerization steps and cell lysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such an activity has been described to date. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The E. coli strains DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1 Φ80 dlacZ ΔM15) (Invitrogen) was used as the host for plasmids. The FB8r lysA::KmR strain (33Mengin-Lecreulx D. Siegel E. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3282-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to study the incorporation of radiolabeled meso-A2pm into peptidoglycan. The plasmid vector pTrc99A was from Amersham Biosciences and the construction of pTrcHis30 and pTrcHis60 plasmids has been previously described (34Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pTO4 plasmid carrying the cma gene encoding colicin M and the cmi immunity gene has been previously described (35Olschlager T. Schramm E. Braun V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 196: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The BW25113 strain and the pKD3 and pKD46 plasmids used for gene disruption experiments (36Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by B. Wanner via the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (Yale University, New Haven). 2YT medium or minimal medium M63 (37Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-435Google Scholar) was used for growing cells. Ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol were used at 100, 35, and 25 μg·ml−1, respectively. General DNA Techniques and E. coli Cell Transformation— PCR amplification of genes from the E. coli chromosome were performed in a Thermocycler 60 apparatus (Bio-med) using the Expand-Fidelity polymerase from Roche. The DNA fragments were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification kit (Promega). Standard procedures for endonuclease digestions, ligation and agarose electrophoresis were used (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Small and large scale plasmid isolations were carried out by the alkaline lysis method (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). E. coli cells were made competent for transformation with plasmid DNA by the method of Dagert and Ehrlich (39Dagert M. Ehrlich S.D. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) or by electroporation. Construction of Expression Plasmids—A plasmid allowing overexpression of the colicin M cma gene was constructed as follows: PCR primers Cma1 and Cma2 (see Table 1) were designed to incorporate an NcoI site 5′ to the initiation codon of the gene and a PstI site 3′ to the gene after the stop codon, respectively. The pTO4 plasmid (35Olschlager T. Schramm E. Braun V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 196: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was used as the source of cma gene for the amplification and the resulting DNA fragment was treated with NcoI and PstI and ligated between the same sites of vector pTrc99A. The resulting plasmid, pMLD188, allowed expression of the cma gene under the control of the strong isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible trc promoter.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotidesSequenceaRestriction sites (in bold) introduced in oligonucleotides are indicated in parentheses, and the initiation codon of cma gene is underlinedFhuA-Inact1GTTACCGCTGCACCTGCGCCGCAAGAAAGCGCATGGGGGCCTGCTGCAACGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCFhuA-Inact2CAGTATAACGACCACCGGTGCCCAGCGTCAGACCTGAAAGCGGACCGTCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGFhuA1ATACCCATGGCGCGTTCCAAAACTGCTCAGCC(NcoI)FhuA2AAGAGAGATCTGAAACGGAAGGTTGCGGTTGCAACGACCTG(BglII)Cma1TTATCCATGGAAACCTTAACTGTTCATGCACCATC(NcoI)Cma2CTAACTGCAGGTTATAAAGGCTGCATAAAAAGCCG(PstI)Cma3GGAGGGATCCATGGAAACCTTAACTGTTCATGCAC(BamHI)Cma4CCTTAGATCTTCGCTTACCACTTTCTTTAATGTG(BglII)CmiATTGCTGCAGCCACTTCACAGTATGCTCACATTG(PstI)a Restriction sites (in bold) introduced in oligonucleotides are indicated in parentheses, and the initiation codon of cma gene is underlined Open table in a new tab For expression of N-terminal His6-tagged colicin M, the gene was amplified with primers Cma2 and Cma3 and the resulting fragment was cut with BamHI and PstI and inserted into pTrcHis30, generating plasmid pMLD189. For expression of C-terminal His6-tagged colicin M, the gene was amplified with primers Cma1 and Cma4 and the resulting fragment was cut with NcoI and BglII and inserted into pTrcHis60, generating the plasmid pMLD190. A plasmid carrying both the cma gene and the cmi immunity gene was also constructed: in that case oligonucleotides Cma1 and Cmi were used for PCR amplification from the pTO4 plasmid and the 1.3-kb resulting fragment was cut by NcoI and PstI and inserted between the same sites of the vector pTrc99A, generating pMLD170. In all cases DNA sequencing was performed to determine that the sequence of the cloned fragments was correct. Construction of a Null fhuA Mutant—The E. coli mutant strain BW25113 ΔfhuA::CmR, carrying a deletion of the chromosomal fhuA gene (an internal 1,819-bp fragment of the 2,244-bp gene was deleted and replaced by the chloramphenicol resistance gene), was created by following the method of Datsenko and Wanner (36Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar). The FhuA-Inact1 and FhuA-Inact2 oligonucleotides (Table 1) were used for PCR amplification of the antibiotic resistance gene from pKD3 flanked by sequences designed for specific disruption of the fhuA gene. The 1.1-kb PCR product was transformed by electroporation into BW25113(pKD46) cells that express phage lambda Red recombinase (36Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol-resistant clones were isolated, and the inactivation of the fhuA gene was verified by PCR using the FhuA1 and FhuA2 primers. Preparation of Crude Extracts and Purification of Colicin M— BW25113 ΔfhuA::CmR cells carrying plasmids pMLD189 or pMLD190 were grown at 37 °C in 2YT-ampicillin medium (2-liter cultures). When the optical density of the culture reached 1, IPTG was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for 3 h. Cells were harvested and washed with 40 ml of cold 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 150 mm NaCl (buffer A). The cell pellet (∼8 g wet wt) was suspended in 25 ml of the same buffer, and cells were disrupted by sonication in the cold (Bioblock Vibracell sonicator, model 72412). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 200,000 × g in a TL100 Beckman centrifuge. The supernatant (∼400 mg of proteins) was stored at −20 °C. The His6-tagged colicin M was purified basically following the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). Soluble fractions described above were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with nickel-nitrilotriacetate (Ni2+-NTA)-agarose pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The polymer was then washed extensively with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole and elution of the protein was obtained by increasing step by step the concentration of imidazole, from 40 to 300 mm, in buffer A. Pure protein-containing fractions (100-200 mm imidazole) were concentrated to 8 ml on a Millipore PM10 membrane and then dialyzed overnight against 100 volumes of buffer A. The final preparations were stored at −20 °C after addition of 15% glycerol. Determination of Colicin M Activity—The bacteriolytic activity of the crude soluble extracts prepared from the colicin M-expressing BW25113 fhuA strain and of the purified His6-tagged colicin M was tested both on plates and in liquid medium. 2YT-agar plates were overlaid with 3 ml of soft nutrient agar containing ∼108 indicator bacteria (BW25113 or DH5α). Serial dilutions (×3) of colicin M-containing solutions were made in buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and 2-μl samples were spotted on the overlay. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and the titer of the colicin was expressed as the reciprocal of the final dilution still giving a clear spot. When assayed in liquid medium, dilutions of colicin M were added to exponentially growing cells when the optical density at 600 nm reached the value of 0.6. Preparation of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and Derivatives—Unlabeled and radiolabeled forms of UDP-MurNAc-l-[14C]Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-A2pm-d-Ala-d-Ala were prepared as previously described (40Bouhss A.

The reaction was initiated by the addition of pure colicin M (2.7 μg), and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under shaking with a thermomixer (Eppendorf). In all cases, the reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 1 min, and the mixture was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates LK6D (Whatman) using either 1-propyl alcohol/ammonium hydroxide/water (6:3:1; v/v/v) (solvent system I) or diisobutyl ketone/acetic acid/water (8:5:1, v/v/v) (solvent system II) as a mobile phase. The radioactive spots were located and quantified with a radioactivity scanner (model Multi-Tracemaster LB285; Berthold France). Purification of Lipid I and Lipid II Degradation Products by HPLC—Standard colicin M assays were performed as described above except that lipid I and lipid II (1 nmol) were used in unlabeled form. The reaction mixtures were diluted into 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, and applied to a Nucleosil 100C18 5 μm (4.6 × 250 mm, Alltech) column. Elution was performed with the phosphate buffer for 30 min, followed by a linear gradient of methanol from 0 to 20% during the next 30 min, at a flow rate of 0.6 ml·min−1. Peaks were detected at 215 nm. In these conditions the 1-pyrophospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide and 1-pyrophospho-MurNAc-(pentapeptide)-GlcNAc degradation products were eluted at 18 and 40 min, respectively. In the same conditions, pure 1-phospho-Mur-NAc-pentapeptide and the two α and β anomers of MurNAc-pentapeptide were eluted at 28, 34, and 50 min, respectively.

Our correlation definition provides a chain persistence length of 10 mean droplet diameters, decreasing as load is applied to the pile. We also measured the angles between contacts and showed that the chainlike arrangement arises from the balance of forces. Moreover, we found that piles whose height was comparable to the chain persistence length exhibited substantially greater strain hardening than did tall piles, which we attributed to the force chains. Together, the results establish a connection between the microscopic force network and the elastic response of meso- or macroscopic granular piles. The conclusions drawn here should be relevant in jammed systems generally, including concentrated emulsions and piles of sand or other heavy particles."
https://openalex.org/W1976957132,"Malaria is caused by protozoan erythrocytic parasites of the Plasmodium genus, with Plasmodium falciparum being the most dangerous and widespread disease-causing species. Falcipain-2 (FP-2) of P. falciparum is a papain-family (C1A) cysteine protease that plays an important role in the parasite life cycle by degrading erythrocyte proteins, most notably hemoglobin. Inhibition of FP-2 and its paralogues prevents parasite maturation, suggesting these proteins may be valuable targets for the design of novel antimalarial drugs, but lack of structural knowledge has impeded progress toward the rational discovery of potent, selective, and efficacious inhibitors. As a first step toward this goal, we present here the crystal structure of mature FP-2 at 3.1 A resolution, revealing novel structural features of the FP-2 subfamily proteases including a dynamic β-hairpin hemoglobin binding motif, a flexible N-terminal α-helical extension, and a unique active-site cleft. We also demonstrate by biochemical methods that mature FP-2 can proteolytically process its own precursor in trans at neutral to weakly alkaline pH, that the binding of hemoglobin to FP-2 is strictly pH-dependent, and that FP-2 preferentially binds methemoglobin over hemoglobin. Because the specificity and proteolytic activity of FP-2 toward its multiple targets appears to be pH-dependent, we suggest that environmental pH may play an important role in orchestrating FP-2 function over the different life stages of the parasite. Moreover, it appears that selectivity of FP-2 for methemoglobin may represent an evolutionary adaptation to oxidative stress conditions within the host cell."
https://openalex.org/W2163144293,"We segregated coexisting gabbroic and granitic melts by centrifuging them at high pressures and temperatures and measured the trace element compositions of the melts by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrate that the effect of melt structure contributes about one order of magnitude to crystal/melt partition coefficients. Partitioning of alkali and alkaline earth elements strongly depends on field strength: Amphoteric and lone pair electron elements partition into the polymerized granitic melt; and rare earth, transition, and high field strength elements coordinated by nonbridging oxygens partition remarkably similar into the gabbroic melt. A regular solution model predicts these effects."

https://openalex.org/W2086348715,"The nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) are modular, cofactor-containing enzymes, divided into a heme-containing oxygenase domain and an FMN- and FAD-containing reductase domain. The domains are connected by a calmodulin (CaM)-binding sequence, occupancy of which is required for nitric oxide (NO) production. Two additional CaM-modulated regulatory elements are present in the reductase domains of the constitutive isoforms, the autoregulatory region (AR) and the C-terminal tail region. Deletion of the AR reduces CaM stimulation of electron flow through the reductase domain from 10-fold in wild-type nNOS to 2-fold in the mutant. Deletion of the C terminus yields an enzyme with greatly enhanced reductase activity in the absence of CaM but with activity equivalent to that of wild-type enzyme in its presence. A mutant in which both the AR and C terminus were deleted completely loses CaM modulation through the reductase domain. Thus, transduction of the CaM effect through the reductase domain of nNOS is dependent on these elements. Formation of nitric oxide is, however, still stimulated by CaM in all three mutants. A CaM molecule in which the N-terminal lobe was replaced by the C-terminal lobe (CaM-CC) supported NO synthesis by the deletion mutants but not by wild-type nNOS.

There are three different isoforms encoded by different genes, neuronal (nNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and inducible (iNOS). Nitric oxide has been implicated in hemodynamic control, neurotransmission, and the immune response, depending on the cell type in which it is being expressed (for review see Refs. 1Masters B.S.S.

They can be roughly divided into an oxygenase domain, containing heme, tetrahydrobiopterin, and the arginine-binding site, and a reductase domain, containing the flavins FMN and FAD, as well as the NADPH-binding site. These two domains are connected by a calmodulin (CaM)-binding site, which is always occupied under physiological conditions by CaM in iNOS, whereas CaM binding to nNOS and eNOS requires an increase in intracellular calcium.CaM controls NOS activity by regulating the rate of electron flux, by enhancing electron flow through the flavin domain as well as switching on transfer of electrons from the flavin to the heme domain. The flow of electrons is in the form of a hydride ion from NADPH to FAD, from FAD to FMN, and as an electron from FMN to the final acceptor, i.e. the heme domain of the adjacent monomer in the NOS dimer (9Siddhanta U.

In this state, electrons are passed in a facile manner from FAD to FMN. In order for electrons to be passed from FMN to the final acceptor, according to this model, the FMN domain must be unlocked and must move to another position so that it is accessible to the final electron acceptor. CaM facilitates this release of the FMN domain from the closed to the open position, in part by accelerating the release of NADP+ (12Craig D.H. Chapman S.K. Daff S. J. Biol.

The mechanism behind this control by CaM is unclear; however, the CaM response is encoded by the reductase domain, as the isolated reductase domain retains stimulation by CaM (15McMillan K.

This enzyme has completely lost CaM modulation of electron transfer through the reductase domain, although transfer from the reductase to the oxygenase domain remains almost totally CaM-dependent. We also propose a model in which these elements interact directly with each other and CaM, incorporating the concept of the NADPH “lock” proposed by Daff and co-workers (12Craig D.H. Chapman S.K.

The plasmid encoding calmodulin, CaM ACMIP, was kindly provided by Anthony Persechini of the University of Missouri, Kansas City.Recombinant DNA Manipulations—nNOS-AR and nNOS-AR-tr1 were created as follows; the codons encoding the initial 877 amino acids of recombinant rat nNOS, minus the coding sequence for the autoregulatory insert (residues Pro832-Asn868), were amplified by PCR, using nNOS pCW as template, with the following primers: upstream, tag cta cat atg gct gaa gag aac acg; downstream, att ggc cag ggg tcc agt cga c tc aaa gtg cct cat ctc cat taa agc aca.The forward primer encodes an NdeI site for insertion into the vector. The return primer spans the deleted autoregulatory insert and incorporates a silent mutation generating a SalI site for easy screening. The codons encoding amino acids Cys824-Ser1430 for nNOS-AR or Cys824-Gly1397 for nNOS-AR-tr1, minus the coding sequence for the autoregulatory region (residues Pro832-Asn868), were amplified by PCR, using nNOS pCW as template, with the following primers: upstream, tgt gct tta atg gag atg agg cac ttt gag tcg ac t gga ccc ctg gcc aat; downstream (nNOS-AR), ctg cag gtc gac tct aga; downstream (nNOS-AR-tr1), cta gtc tag a tt atc caa aga tgt cct cgt g.The forward primer spans the deleted autoregulatory region and incorporates a silent mutation generating a SalI site for easy screening. The return primers incorporate XbaI sequences for insertion into the vector. Note that the residue numbers given are those of the recombinant protein, which has an additional alanine residue following the initiator methionine for easier expression in Escherichia coli. A third amplification was performed using 1 μl of each of the products generated in the two amplifications above as template and the upstream primer from the first amplification and the downstream primer from the second amplification. The resultant product is a full-length nNOS coding sequence with the autoregulatory region deleted and, in the case of nNOS-AR-tr1, the C terminus also deleted. The PCR products were restriction-digested with NdeI/XbaI (nNOS) and ligated with NdeI/XbaI-digested pCW vector. This ligation was used to transform XL10-gold cells (Stratagene), and colonies were screened by restriction digest. The correct construct was then used to cotransform E. coli BL21 cells along with the groELS plasmid (27Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Anthony Persechini of the University of Missouri, Kansas City.Analysis of FMN and FAD Content—Flavin content of these proteins was analyzed using a Waters analytical HPLC system, equipped with a 2487 absorbance detector and 515 HPLC pumps. A Nova-Pak C18, 60Å, 4-μm (3.9 × 150 mm) column was fitted with a guard column packed with Nova-Pak C18 Guard-Pak HPLC column inserts. Integration and analysis of the chromatograms were done with the Millennium32 chromatography manager (Waters). The column was equilibrated with the mobile phase buffer (filtered and degassed) consisting of 10 mm (NH4)2HPO4 adjusted to pH 5.5 with H3PO4 and acetonitrile in the ratio of 10:1.2 (v/v) as reported (31Pietta P. Calatroni A. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 229: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 1.00 ml/min, and flavins were monitored at 473 nm. Elution profiles of the flavins were calibrated using 20-μl injections of 10 μm standard solutions of FMN, FAD, and an equimolar mixture of these two, made in HPLC-grade water. The protein solutions at concentrations of 10 μm in water were heated for 10 min in a boiling water bath, chilled for 5 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min using an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge. The supernatant was transferred to another tube, and 20-μl aliquots were analyzed by HPLC. Concentrations of FMN and FAD solutions were determined from their absorbance spectra according the values reported (32Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Methods in Molecular Biology: Flavoprotein Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 1-25Google Scholar) (FMN, ϵ445 = 12,500 M−1 cm−1; FAD, ϵ450 = 11,300 m−1 cm−1). In the standards and proteins, FAD eluted at 1.45 min (relative area 58%) and FMN at 1.90 min (relative area 42%). Injections were done in triplicate and agree with each other. All enzymes had FMN: FAD:heme ratios of 1:1:1, except nNOS-AR, which exhibited a mild FMN depletion (0.9:1:1).Spectrophotometric Methods—CO difference spectra were performed as described. The molar protein concentrations for nNOS and nNOS deletion mutants were determined based on heme content via reduced CO difference spectra, where ϵ = 100 mm−1 cm−1 for ΔA445-470, and thus reflect only active enzyme. All spectral analyses were performed using a Shimadzu model 2401PC UV-visible dual-beam spectrophotometer.Activity Measurements—Nitric oxide formation (hemoglobin capture assay) and cytochrome c reduction were measured at 23 °C as described (33Martásek P.

Rates of NO synthesis and cytochrome c reduction were determined using extinction coefficients of 60 mm−1 cm−1 at 401 nm and 21 mm−1 cm−1 at 550 nm, respectively. Ferricyanide reduction was performed in the same manner as cytochrome c reduction except that the ferricyanide concentration was varied and the extinction coefficient was 1.02 mm−1 cm−1 at 420 nm. The data were fit to a rectangular hyperbola, and Km and kcat values were extracted. The reoxidation of reduced flavins was monitored at 485 nm for all enzymes in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 μm NADPH, and 2 μm enzyme at 23 °C (19Roman L.J.

The nNOS AR is a 37-amino acid insert in the FMN domain, encompassing residues 832-868, which crystal structure data has shown to be relatively unstructured, with only a 9-residue helical region in the middle of the insert being detectable (34Garcin E.D. Bruns C.M. Lloyd S.J. Hosfield D.J. Tiso M. Gachhui R. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37918-37927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The nNOS C-terminal tail is a 33-amino acid extension, encompassing residues 1397-1429, of which residues 1401-1412 form an α-helical region that lies across the FMN/FAD interface (34Garcin E.D. Bruns C.M. Lloyd S.J. Hosfield D.J. Tiso M. Gachhui R. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37918-37927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and residues 1397-1400 interact with FMN and NADPH binding domains; the remaining C-terminal amino acids cannot be seen in the structure. To investigate the roles of these regions in CaM-dependent regulation, we characterized deletion mutants of each of these elements, as well as a double deletion in which both elements are absent (Fig. 1b).Cytochrome c Reduction—The flow of electrons through the nitric-oxide synthase reductase domain is NADPH to FAD to FMN. As in the case with CYPOR, it is the NOS hydroquinone that donates electrons to cytochrome c (35Masters B.S.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); the NOS FMN semiquinone or a NOS in which FMN has been removed cannot reduce cytochrome c (36Matsuda H. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in this process is the transfer of electrons from FAD to FMN (37Miller R.T. Martásek P. Omura T. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, cytochrome c reduction is a measure of electron flux through the entire reductase domain. Cytochrome c reduction by the various deletion mutants determined in the presence and absence of CaM is shown in Fig. 2a.FIGURE 2Catalytic activities of nNOS, nNOS-tr1, nNOS-AR, and nNOS-AR-tr1. Striped bars, activity in the absence of CaM; solid bars, activity in the presence of CaM. a, cytochrome c reduction; b, NO synthesis as measured by the hemoglobin capture assay; c, NADPH oxidation. All assays were performed at least in triplicate and as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Final enzyme concentrations were 1 nm in the cytochrome c reduction assay and 100 nm in the NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As expected, cytochrome c reduction by nNOS-wt is stimulated ∼10-fold by CaM, whereas nNOS-tr1 is inhibited about 60% by CaM. When the autoregulatory region is deleted, CaM modulation of reductase activity is decreased but still evident; nNOS-AR is stimulated only about 2-fold by CaM. When both the autoregulatory region and the C-terminal tail are removed, CaM no longer affects cytochrome c reduction, indicating CaM modulation of electron flow through the reductase domain is implemented entirely by these two regulatory elements. These observations suggest an interaction between these regions in the inhibited enzyme conformation.Ferricyanide Reduction—Ferricyanide receives reducing equivalents in electron transfer from the NOS and CYPOR FAD moieties. Although it cannot be completely discounted that ferricyanide can receive electrons from FMN also, chimeric constructs between CYPOR and nNOS strongly implicate FAD as the primary donor. Unlike CYPOR, which has a Km for ferricyanide of 32 μm, the Km of nNOS for ferricyanide is in the 1-2 mm range in the absence of CaM but is decreased by about 50% (∼750 μm) in its presence (38Roman L.J.

Concentrations of ferricyanide over 2 mm have very high absorbance, making it difficult to assay reduction at large enough concentrations of ferricyanide, so turnover numbers must be extrapolated from plots of initial rate versus substrate concentration, which also will yield apparent Km values.Table 1 shows the data derived for ferricyanide reduction in the presence and absence of CaM for nNOS-wt and the various deletions. Neither nNOS-wt nor any of the deletion mutants exhibit alterations of kcat values in the presence or absence of CaM, indicating that the rate of electron flow from NADPH to FAD to ferricyanide is unaffected by CaM. The Km values, however, are affected differentially by CaM depending on the presence or absence of the C-terminal insert. nNOS-wt and nNOS-AR, both of which have intact C termini, demonstrate CaM regulation of Km values, whereas nNOS-tr1 and nNOS-AR-tr1, both of which are missing their C termini, have the same Km values in both the presence and absence of CaM. These data indicate that in the absence of CaM the C terminus of nNOS may interfere with ferricyanide access; in the presence of CaM the C terminus is realigned to alleviate this interference.TABLE 1Ferricyanide reduction by nNOS and deletion mutantsConstructkcatKmmin−1μMnNOS34,630 ± 41401840 ± 380nNOS + CaM30,530 ± 3500780 ± 210nNOS-tr122,750 ± 230315 ± 130nNOS-tr1 + CaM23,330 ± 300459 ± 145nNOS-AR20,768 ± 11531070 ± 97nNOS-AR + CaM20,071 ± 3439223 ± 126nNOS-AR-tr135,670 ± 4840730 ± 420nNOS-AR-tr1 + CaM31,420 ± 2520620 ± 100 Open table in a new tab Nitric oxide Synthesis—Evidence indicates that nitric oxide synthesis requires electron flow through the reductase domain of one monomer into the heme domain of another (10Siddhanta U.

In the presence of CaM, heme reduction is allowed and NO synthesis occurs. Fig. 2b shows the effect of CaM on NO synthesis in the presence and absence of the AR and/or C-terminal regulatory elements. CaM is required in all cases for maximal NO synthesis activity, and deletion of AR and/or the C terminus has a minimal (∼25%) effect on the rate of NO synthesis. Interestingly, in the absence of the C terminus, a small amount of NO is produced in the absence of CaM, although the rate is stimulated 8-10-fold in its presence. The observation that CaM is required for or greatly stimulates NO production indicates an additional role for CaM other than stimulation of electron flow through the reductase domain and, possibly, the presence of another regulatory element to mediate this process.Mutant CaM Support of NO Synthesis—CaM is a dumbbell-shaped protein with N- and C-terminal globular domains connected by an α-helical linker. The C-terminal lobe binds to the N-terminal region of the nNOS CaM-binding site and the N-terminal lobe binds to the C-terminal region of nNOS CaM-binding site (40Zhang M. Yuan T. Aramini J.M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20901-20907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A CaM molecule in which the N-terminal lobe was replaced by a copy of the C-terminal lobe (CaM-CC (30Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)), such that both globular domains consisted of C-terminal lobes, was examined for its ability to support NO synthesis by nNOS and the deletion mutants. In agreement with previous investigations, the data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that CaM-CC activates wild-type nNOS activity to only 17% of the maximum. It is therefore striking that CaM-CC activates nNOS-AR and nNOS-AR-tr1 synthase activities as well as native CaM and activates nNOS-tr1 synthase activity nearly as well as native CaM.FIGURE 3Support of NO synthesis by CaM and CaM-CC. Solid bars, CaM; hatched bars, CaM-CC. NO synthesis in the presence of CaM was set to 100% for each of the constructs; the activities were 30 ± 2, 32 ± 5, 20 ± 1, and 18 ± 4 min−1 for nNOS, nNOS-tr1, nNOS-AR, and nNOS-AR-tr1, respectively. NO synthesis in the presence of CaM-CC was calculated as the percentage of CaM-supported activity. Assays were performed at least in triplicate and as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Final enzyme concentration was 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NADPH Oxidation—In the absence of substrate, NADPH oxidation by nNOS results in superoxide formation. In the absence of CaM, superoxide formation occurs via the flavins of the reductase domain, because electrons are not passed to the heme. In the presence of CaM, the nNOS heme is reduced, and superoxide formation occurs at this site; the rate is ∼7-fold higher than in the absence of CaM. Fig. 2c shows NADPH oxidation by nNOS and each of the deletion mutants in the presence and absence of CaM. In all cases, NADPH oxidation is stimulated by CaM, although to a lesser extent in the deletion mutants than in wild-type nNOS (7-fold versus 4.3, 4.5, and 3.1-fold for wild-type, nNOS-tr1, nNOS-AR, nNOS-AR-tr1, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W2114435986,"In developing embryos of some extant spiralian animals, polar lobe formation is one of the symmetry-breaking mechanisms for segregation of maternal cytoplasmic substances to certain blastomeres and not others. Polar lobe formation leads to unique early cleavage morphologies that include trilobed, J-shaped, and five-lobed structures. Fossil embryos similar to modern lobeforming embryos are recognized from the Precambrian Doushantuo Formation phosphates, Weng'an, Guizhou Province, China. These embryos are abundant and form a developmental sequence comparable to different developing stages observed in lobe-forming embryos of extant spiralians. These data imply that lobe formation is an evolutionarily ancient process of embryonic specification."

We now demonstrate that the addition of inositol to yeast cells growing in the presence of choline leads to a dramatic reprogramming of cellular lipid synthesis and turnover. The response to inositol includes a 5-6-fold increase in cellular phosphatidylinositol content within a period of 30 min. The increase in phosphatidylinositol content appears to be dependent upon fatty acid synthesis. Phosphatidylcholine turnover increased rapidly following inositol addition, a response that requires the participation of Nte1p, an endoplasmic reticulum-localized phospholipase B. Mass spectrometry revealed that the acyl species composition of phosphatidylinositol is relatively constant regardless of supplementation with inositol or choline, whereas phosphatidylcholine acyl species composition is influenced by both inositol and choline. In medium containing inositol, but lacking choline, high levels of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine were detected. Within 60 min following the addition of inositol, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine levels had decreased from ∼40% of total phosphatidylcholine to a basal level of less than 5%. nte1Δ cells grown in the absence of inositol and in the presence of choline exhibited lower levels of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine than wild type cells grown under these same conditions, but these levels remained largely constant after the addition of inositol.

Recent genome-wide analyses revealed that growth in the presence of inositol also affects the steady-state transcript abundance of over 100 genes (3Santiago T.C. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol.

Many of these genes encode enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and contain the conserved UASINO element in their promoters. INO1, which encodes inositol-3-phosphate synthase, is the most highly regulated of the UASINO-containing genes (5Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). INO1 is repressed some 50-fold if inositol is present and 150-fold if choline, precursor to phosphatidylcholine (PC) (Fig. 1), is present in addition to inositol (4Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Activation of INO1 and other UASINO-containing genes requires the Ino2p and Ino4p transcription factors, which bind as a heterodimer directly to UASINO (6Ambroziak J. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

In certain genetic backgrounds, increased phospholipase D-mediated turnover of PC also results in derepression of the INO1 gene (9Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J.

Likewise, mutations affecting the synthesis of PC via methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Fig. 1) result in abnormal patterns of phospholipid accumulation and misregulation of UASINO-containing genes (11Griac P.

These and related observations led to the hypothesis that a signal or signals generated by ongoing lipid metabolism are involved in the transcriptional regulation of UASINO-containing genes (14Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the mechanism by which a signal from lipid metabolism is sensed and subsequently influences the expression of the INO1 gene was elucidated. The negative regulator, Opi1p, required for repression of the UASINO-containing genes (15Greenberg M.L. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16White M.J. Lopes J.M. Henry S.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1991; 32: 1-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was shown to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a part of a protein complex that also contains the membrane-spanning protein Scs2p (17Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T.

Opi1p interacts with Scs2p via a domain called FFAT, and this interaction is required for retention of Opi1p in the ER (2Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, Opi1p also binds PA, which accumulates as an intermediate in the absence of inositol (2Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and this binding is required in addition to the interaction with Scs2p in order for Opi1p to remain in the ER. Upon the addition of inositol, PA levels in the ER drop as a consequence of increased PI synthesis, resulting in the release of Opi1p from the ER and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where it acts to repress INO1 and co-regulated genes (2Loewen C.J.

Analysis of the kinetics of the transcriptional responses to inositol genome-wide revealed that over 700 genes show a significant change in expression in at least one time point over a 2-h time course following the addition of inositol to medium already containing choline. Many of these changes occur in the first 15-30 min following the addition of inositol. The transcript abundance of many of these genes is affected only transiently, returning to basal levels within 60-120 min after inositol addition. This explains, in part, the fact that larger numbers of genes were detected in the kinetic analysis of the response to inositol (19Jesch S.A. Liu P.Z.X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. June 15, 2006; 10.1074/jbc.M604541200Google Scholar), in comparison with steady-state analysis of transcript abundance (3Santiago T.C. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol.

Whereas many of the genes regulated in response to inositol contain the UASINO element, the majority of the genes that respond to inositol and choline fall into other categories, including those that respond to the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and the low oxygen response element (LORE) (4Jesch S.A.

We now report on an analysis of phospholipid biosynthesis and turnover employing an identical time course and growth conditions that permit direct comparison of changes in potential signaling molecules produced in the course of lipid metabolism with the kinetics of the transcriptional response to inositol reported by Jesch et al.

We report that the addition of inositol to the growth medium induces not only a rapid increase in the rate of synthesis of PI and an almost equally rapid increase in the total cellular content of PI, but also a concurrent decline in PC content brought about by the combined effects of increased turnover and diminished synthesis. We also show that the increased turnover of PC in response to inositol requires Nte1p, a phospholipase B that resides in the ER (20Zaccheo O. Dinsdale D. Meacock P.A. Glynn P. J. Biol.

Cultures were maintained on YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 2% agar) medium plates. All experiments were conducted using cultures grown to midlogarithmic phase at 30 °C on a rotary shaker (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc.) at 200 rpm using chemically defined synthetic media, as described by Jesch et al. (4Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), containing 1 g of potassium phosphate/liter. Cells were grown in 50-ml batches of complete synthetic media with (I+) or without (I−) inositol (75 μm) with (C+) or without (C−) choline (1 mm) as indicated. Materials—All chemicals were reagent grade. Phospholipid standards were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Neutral lipid standards and cerulenin were purchased from Sigma. 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Radiochemicals were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and scintillation-counting supplies were purchased from National Diagnostics. Silica gel-loaded SG81 chromatography paper was purchased from Whatman, Inc., and HPTLC plates were from Merck. Growth medium supplies were purchased from Difco. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Phospholipids—Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis of phospholipid mixtures was carried out utilizing a Bruker Esquire LC Mass Spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard, Inc.) equipped with a standard orthogonal electrospray source and a three-dimensional ion trap. The samples were introduced into the mass spectrometer at a rate of infusion of 120 μl/h. The capillary voltage was set at +3500 or −3500 V for positive or negative modes, respectively. Phospholipid samples for mass spectrometry were isolated from 3-liter cultures (in duplicate) grown to midlogarithmic phase in the specified synthetic media (i.e. no inositol or choline, inositol alone, no inositol with choline, and both choline and inositol) at 30 °C. In general, cells were harvested by rapid filtration through Durapore® membrane filters (0.65-μm polyvinylidene fluoride, Millipore Corp.) and immediately transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask containing a 45 mm aqueous solution of potassium cyanide. The cells were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min, and the cell pellet was washed twice with water and lysed with 10% trichloroacetic acid in an ice bath for 25 min. The cell membranes were spun down, and the supernatant was discarded. The cell membrane phospholipids were extracted with a solvent mixture consisting of ethanol, water, ethyl ether, pyridine, and ammonium hydroxide (45:45: 15:3:0.003, v/v/v/v/v). The extract was centrifuged, and the supernatant was recovered and partitioned twice with 50 ml of a chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) mixture and 5 ml of a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution in a separatory funnel. The lower organic phase was collected, pooled, and taken to dryness with a gentle stream of N2. Phospholipid extracts isolated from S. cerevisiae cells were retaken in a mixture of chloroform and methanol (1:2, v/v). Samples for analysis in the negative mode were added to 2.5% of triethylamine or left untreated for analysis in the positive mode (chemical species were detected as sodiated ions). Mass Spectrometry Determination of PI and PC Species Composition at Steady State and Turnover following Inositol Addition—Wild type cultures were grown overnight under four different growth conditions: no inositol or choline (I−C−), inositol alone (I+C−), no inositol with choline (I−C+), and both choline and inositol (I+C+). For steady-state studies, 3-liter cultures of wild type cells were grown at 30 °C for eight generations and rapidly harvested and processed for phospholipid analysis by mass spectrometry as described above. For turnover studies of PI and PC species following inositol addition, 3-liter cultures of wild type or nte1Δ cells were grown in I−C+ medium to midlogarithmic phase. 21 ml of a 10 mm inositol solution were added, and the cells were allowed to continue their growth for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min before they were harvested and processed for PI and PC species composition analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry as described above. Analysis of Fatty Acid Composition—Total fatty acid analysis was carried out in a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph (splitless mode) coupled to an HP 5970 B Mass Selective Detector (DB-1 capillary column, 30 × 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25-mm film thickness, J & W Scientific, Folsum, CA). The oven temperature was held at 100 °C for 2 min, raised at 10 °C/min to 200 °C, held for 10 min, and raised at 3 °C/min to 300 °C. Fatty acid samples for gas chromatography analysis were isolated from 50-ml yeast cell cultures (in duplicate) grown to midlogarithmic phase in the specified synthetic media (i.e. I−C−, I+C−, I−C+, and I+C+) at 30 °C. The cells were spun down, washed twice with water, and transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and lysed with 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10%) for 25 min in an ice bath. The Eppendorf tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 7500 rpm, and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were washed twice with sterile water and extracted with 1 ml of a solvent mixture consisting of ethanol, water, ethyl ether, pyridine, and ammonium hydroxide (45:45: 15:3:0.003, v/v/v/v/v). The extract was centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a 15-ml glass test tube and partitioned with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and three drops of a saturated solution of sodium chloride. The lower phase was collected and taken to dryness with a gentle stream of nitrogen. The residue was extracted twice with a total of 1 ml of boron trifluoride in methanol (14%; Sigma) and transferred to 1.5-ml glass vials, capped, and heated to 100 °C in a sand bath for 30 min. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature and extracted with 1 ml of hexane. The hexane extract was collected and washed with water and taken to dryness under a nitrogen stream. Three drops of hexane were added to the residue for analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Determination of Steady-state Phospholipid Composition by 32P Labeling—Wild type cultures were grown overnight under the four different growth conditions: I−C−, I+C−, I−C+, and I+C+. Cells were labeled to steady state by the addition of 20 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (specific activity of isotope was 2.7 mCi/mmol phosphate). To analyze the steady-state lipid composition, cells were grown at 30 °C for eight generations in the presence of the label. Labeling for additional generations produced no change in the percentage distribution of the label into lipid classes (data not shown), indicating that a steady-state labeling condition was achieved. 5-ml samples were mixed with 0.5 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to stand on ice for 20 min. The samples were washed twice with distilled water. Labeled lipids were extracted as previously described (24Atkinson K. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

Phospholipid identity was based on the mobility of known standards and quantified on a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Kinetic Analysis of Changes in Phospholipid Composition following Inositol Addition—To determine changes in the composition of the phospholipids over a set time course following the addition of inositol, cells were first grown in I−C+ medium, and phospholipids were labeled with 20 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate to steady state. When the cells reached the midlogarithmic phase of growth (A600 = 0.5), inositol to a final concentration of 75 μm, was added, and aliquots were taken at 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. A control sample (0 min) was taken just prior to the addition of inositol. Cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted and analyzed as described above. Analysis of Phospholipid Turnover following Inositol Addition— To follow the turnover of phospholipids after the addition of inositol, wild type and nte1Δ cells were grown, as described above, to steady state in the presence of 20 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in I−C+ medium. When the cells reached A600 = 0.5, they were quickly collected by filtration, washed with prewarmed I−C+ medium at 30 °C, and placed in unlabeled fresh I+C+ medium prewarmed to 30 °C. Samples were taken at 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min and following filtration and transfer to unlabeled medium, and lipid extraction and analysis was performed as described above. As a control, cells were also transferred to fresh unlabeled I−C+ medium, and samples were taken over the same time course as those in I+C+ medium. Short Term Labeling of Phospholipids—To analyze new synthesis of glycerophospholipids following the addition of inositol, wild type and nte1Δ cells were pregrown to A600 = 0.5 in I−C+ medium, and 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (specific activity of isotope was 13.51 mCi/mmol of phosphate) was added. Samples were taken 10 and 20 min following the addition of [32P]orthophosphate. At 20 min, inositol was added to a final concentration of 75 μm, and cells were sampled at 10-min intervals until 50 min following 32P introduction (i.e. 30, 40, and 50 min following 32P introduction). Lipids were extracted and quantified by two-dimensional chromatography, as described above. The design of this experiment is very similar to that reported previously in Loewen et al. (2Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), with the exception that choline was present in the current experiment, and the cells were labeled in the I−C+ medium for 20 min prior to the addition of inositol (as opposed to 10-min labeling with 32PinI−C− medium prior to the inositol addition in Loewen et al. (2Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar)). Assessment of Neutral Lipid Composition by [1-14C]Acetate Labeling—Wild type cells were grown in four different conditions, as described above (i.e. I−C−, I+C−, I−C+, and I+C+). Cultures were grown at 30 °C in the presence of 1 μCi/ml of [1-14C]acetate (specific activity, 57 mCi/mmol) overnight. The next day, cultures were diluted to A600 = 0.1 maintaining label at 1 μCi/ml [1-14C]acetate and allowed to grow until midlogarithmic phase (A600 = 0.5). The cells were then harvested using the same methods described above for 32P labeling experiments. Total lipids were extracted with a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) (26Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chloroform phase was dried, and the residue was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Steady-state incorporation of label into major neutral lipid classes was determined by thin layer chromatography. Neutral lipids were separated on Whatman Silica Gel 60A HPTLC plates using the solvent system hexane/diethyl ether/formic acid (80:20:2, v/v/v) (27Christie W. Lipid Analysis: Isolation, Separation, Identification, and Structural Analysis of Lipids.in: Christie W. The Oily Press, Bridgwater, UK2003: 105-112Google Scholar). Labeled lipids on the chromatograms were quantified on a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Metabolite identity was determined by comparison with the mobility of known standards. Kinetic Analysis of Changes in Neutral Lipid Composition following Inositol Addition—To follow changes in the relative composition of the neutral lipid classes following the addition of inositol, wild type cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [1-14C]acetate to steady state, as described above, in I−C+ medium. A 5-ml sample, which served as time 0 control, was taken prior to the addition of inositol, and then inositol was added to a final concentration of 75 μm, and 5 ml of cells were harvested at 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Neutral lipids were extracted and analyzed as described above for assessment of steady-state neutral lipid composition. Short Time Course Labeling with [1-14C]Acetate—To analyze new synthesis of both neutral lipids and selective phospholipids in a single experiment following inositol addition, 1 μCi/ml [1-14C]acetate was added to cultures of wild type and nte1Δ cells grown to midlogarithmic phase (A600 = 0.5) in I−C+ medium. Samples were taken 10, 20, and 30 min following the addition of label. At 60 min following the addition of label, inositol was added to a final concentration of 75 μm, and samples were collected at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min following the addition of inositol. Lipid extraction and analysis was performed, as described above, for the 32P and 14C steady-state labeling. Phospholipids were separated on Whatman Silica Gel 60A HPTLC plates using the solvent system chloroform/ethyl acetate/acetone/isopropyl alcohol/ethanol/methanol/water/acetic acid (30:6:6:6:16:28:6:2, v/v/v/v/v/v/v/v) (28Weerheim A.M. Kolb A.M. Sturk A. Nieuwland R. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The neutral lipid classes were analyzed on HPTLC plates using hexane/diethylether/formic acid (80:20:2, v/v/v) (27Christie W. Lipid Analysis: Isolation, Separation, Identification, and Structural Analysis of Lipids.in: Christie W. The Oily Press, Bridgwater, UK2003: 105-112Google Scholar). Metabolite identity was established based on the mobility of known standards. The amounts of labeled lipids on the chromatograms were quantified on a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Short Time Course Labeling in the Presence of Cerulenin—In order to measure the effects of inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis on phospholipid synthesis, wild type cells were grown in I−C+ medium at midlogarithmic phase (A600 = 0.5) and were exposed to different concentrations of cerulenin, an inhibitor of de novo fatty acid synthesis (29Nomura S. Horiuchi T. Omura S. Hata T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 71: 783-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protocols similar to those described above for short term labeling with either 1 μCi/ml [1-14C]acetate or 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate were carried out. For experiments involving short term labeling with [1-14C]acetate, wild type cells were grown at 30 °C to A600 = 0.5 in I−C+ or I+C+ medium and treated with concentrations of cerulenin ranging from 0.625 to 10 μg/ml. Label and cerulenin were added simultaneously, and samples were taken at 15, 30, and 45 min following the addition of inositol. Cells were harvested, and phospholipids and neutral lipid classes were extracted and analyzed as described above for 14C steady-state labeling. For short term labeling with [32P]orthophosphate, the procedure described above for short term labeling of phospholipids with 32P of wild type cells was followed. At zero time, both 32P and 10 μg/ml (4.4 × 10−5 m) cerulenin were added simultaneously. Inositol was added to a final concentration of 75 μm to the cultures 20 min after the addition of the label and cerulenin. Samples were collected at the time points indicated. Quantitation of Transcripts by Northern Blotting—Wild type and nte1Δ cells were grown in liquid I−C+ medium to midlogarithmic growth phase, and inositol was added to a final concentration of 75 μm. Cells were harvested by filtration and immediately frozen on dry ice immediately prior to and 5, 15, 30, and 60 min following the addition of inositol. Total RNA from each time point was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Inc.). 250 ng of total RNA was fractionated on 1.1% glyoxal-agarose gels, transferred to positively charged nylon membrane using Turboblotter (30Burnett W.V. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and probed for INO1, OLE1, KAR2, and ACT1 transcripts using 32P-labeled antisense riboprobes as described (4Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Transcript levels were quantitated by a PhosphorImager. Values were expressed as a ratio of INO1, OLE1, and KAR2 mRNA to ACT1 mRNA levels. To evaluate the expression of the INO1 and OLE1 genes when the de novo synthesis of fatty acids is impaired, wild t"

However, to date little attention has been paid to circadian rhythm in association with expression of clock genes during chondrogenesis in cartilage. In this study, we investigated the functional expression of different clock genes by chondrocytes in the course of cartilage development. The mRNA expression of types I, II, and X collagens exhibited a 24-h rhythm with a peak at zeitgeber time 6, in addition to a 24-h rhythmicity of all the clock genes examined in mouse femurs in vivo. Marked expression of different clock genes was seen in both osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 and chondrogenic ATDC5 cells in vitro, whereas parathyroid hormone (PTH) transiently increased period 1 (per1) mRNA expression at 1 h in both cell lines. Similar increases were seen in the mRNA levels for both per1 and per2 in prehypertrophic chondrocytes in metatarsal organotypic cultures within 2 h of exposure to PTH. PTH significantly activated the mouse per1 (mper1) and mper2 promoters but not the mper3 promoter in a manner sensitive to both a protein kinase A inhibitor and deletion of the cAMP-responsive element sequence (CRE) in ATDC5 cells. In HEK293 cells, introduction of brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (bmal1)/clock enhanced mouse type II collagen first intron reporter activity without affecting promoter activity, with reduction effected by either per1 or per2. These results suggest that PTH directly stimulates mper expression through a protein kinase A-CRE-binding protein signaling pathway for subsequent regulation of bmal1/clock-dependent extracellular matrix expression in cartilage.

Recent studies have revealed that the endogenous circadian rhythmicity generated at the cellular level by circadian core oscillators resides not only in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (1Panda S.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus is not essential for driving peripheral oscillations but rather acts as a synchronizer of peripheral oscillators, whereas the physiological rhythmicity may be under the direct control by their own local clock genes in peripheral tissues (7Yoo S.H.

In mice, the rhythmic transcription of two orthologs of the Drosophila Period (per) gene appears to be essential for circadian rhythms. Expression of mouse per (mper) genes is known to be positively regulated by other clock proteins belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix period/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator/single minded class, which are Clock and brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1), 2The abbreviations used are: Bmal1, brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; Cry, cryptochrome; DIG, digoxigenin; M-CSF, macrophage colony stimulating factor; Per, Period; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PPR, parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptide receptor; PTH, parathyroid hormone; RANKL, receptor activator nuclear factor-κB ligand; Runx2, runt-related transcription factor 2; ZT, zeitgeber time; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RT, reverse transcriptase. respectively. In addition, mPer proteins constitute multimeric complexes with products of the cryptochrome (cry) genes, mcry1 and mcry2, which in turn negatively regulate the gene transcription mediated by Clock/Bmal1 (8Gekakis N.

Nature. 2003; 423: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). During embryogenesis mesenchymal precursor cells differentiate into skeletal elements by forming a cartilaginous model framework, which then induces the bone formation process known as endochondral ossification in the vertebral column and long bone (13Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). This endochondral ossification is responsible for the formation of the cartilaginous rudiment that is a tightly regulated region in both the differentiation and maturation of chondrocytes. Within this cartilaginous rudiment, for example, chondrocytes successively differentiate through a well organized mechanistic procedure with migration from resting cells at the rudiment edge to proliferating, hypertrophic and calcifying cells around the central region, which finally leads to mineralization of the cartilage matrix in the area of the hypertrophic chondrocytes. Shortly after the mineralization process takes place, however, most hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo sustained apoptosis. Upon death of chondrocytes after mineralization, circulating precursors of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and capillaries begin to invade the cartilage matrix to produce new bones, leading to the growth of endochondral bones (12Karsenty G. Nature. 2003; 423: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 13Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Previous reports have demonstrated that expression patterns of two major extracellular matrices in bone, type I collagen and osteocalcin, display circadian rhythms (14Simmons D.J. Nichols G. Am. J. Physiol. 1966; 210: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Gundberg C.M. Markowitz M.E. Mizruchi M. Rpsen J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Karsenty G. Cell. 2005; 122: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), whereas to date no evidence is available for a role of the expression of circadian clock genes in the proliferation and/or differentiation of chondrocytes in the literature. Because parathyroid hormone (PTH) is well known to regulate a variety of cellular functions through PTH/PTH related protein (PTHrP) receptors (PPRs) in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes, it is conceivable that circadian clock genes may be functionally expressed to play a role in the mechanisms associated with PTH-induced modulation of cellular functions in chondrocytes as well as osteoblasts. In the present study, an attempt has been made to demonstrate the expression and functionality of different circadian clock genes in chondrocytes to elucidate circadian oscillation of cartilage development during endochondral ossification. Animals—The protocol employed here meets the guidelines of the Japanese Society for Pharmacology and was approved by the Committee for Ethical Use of Experimental Animals at Kanazawa University. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering, to reduce the number of animals used, and to utilize alternatives to in vivo techniques. Male ddY mice obtained at 4 weeks of age were maintained for 2 weeks under controlled temperature and humidity with a 12-h light (08:00–20:00 h)/12-h dark (20:00–08:00 h) cycle with access to standard laboratory food and water ad libitum. Animals were then decapitated to obtain total RNA from femurs at the following zeitgeber times (ZT): 0, 6, 12, and 18, where ZT 0 is defined as the time of lights on and ZT 12 lights off, respectively. Four animals were usually used for each time point on different days. Cell Cultures—Osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 and chondrogenic ATDC5 cells were purchased from RIKEN Cell Bank. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS. For induction of differentiation, culture media were replaced with medium containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate. ATDC5 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% FBS. For induction of differentiation, culture media were replaced with medium containing 10 μg/ml transferrin, 3 × 10–8 m sodium selenite, and 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma). Primary Osteoclasts—Bone marrow was prepared from tibias and femurs of 4-week-old Std-ddY male mice and cultured for 24 h with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (R&D Systems) at 10 ng/ml in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS. After culturing for 24 h, non-adherent cells in supernatants were collected, followed by lamination on Ficoll gradient, and subsequent centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min. The monocyte/macrophage progenitor fraction was collected and suspended in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS, M-CSF at 20 ng/ml, and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) (R&D Systems) at 20 ng/ml. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2, followed by culturing at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 5 days. Embryonic Metatarsal Rudiment Organ Culture—Metatarsal organ culture was conducted as described previously (17Wang L. Hinoi E. Takemori A. Takarada T. Yoneda Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 146: 732-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The three central metatarsal rudiments were isolated from ddY mouse embryos at 15.5 days post-gestation. Each of three metatarsals was placed in a well of a 24-well plate containing 1 ml of organ culture medium: minimal essential medium supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.25% FBS. These explants were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 5 days. In Situ Hybridization Analysis—In situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (17Wang L. Hinoi E. Takemori A. Takarada T. Yoneda Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 146: 732-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, mounted sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by HCl, proteinase K, and triethanolamine/acetic anhydride treatment. After prehybridization, sections were covered with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cRNA probes at 65 °C for 16 h. The slides were treated with RNase A, blocked with 1.5% blocking buffer, incubated with anti-DIG-AP-Fab fragments (Roche) at 4 °C for 16 h, and treated with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyphosphate for different periods. Moreover, neonatal mice were subcutaneously injected with 400 μg/kg PTH, followed by dissection of tibiae 1 h after administration and subsequent detection of Per1 mRNA expression using a DIG-labeled cRNA probe. Cloning and Constructs—The mper1 (–1803 to +40), mper2 (–1670 to +53), and mper3 (–1594 to +128) promoters and the mutated promoters in terms of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) within the mper1 and mper2 promoters were generous gifts from Dr. Sassone-Corsi (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, France). The 5′-flanking region (–3383 to +41) and first intron regions ((+959 to +1343) and (+959 to +2954)) of the mouse type II collagen were isolated from mouse genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GTTTCTTCCACTCTCAGGATGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGGAGGAGGCAGGAGACCCGG-3′ for the 5′-flanking region, and 5′-GTGTGTAGCCGTGGATGGATATGGG-3′,5′-CCGCCTCCTTCTAAAGCATCTCTGG-3′ (to +1343) and 5′-ACTGCCTAGGACAACCCGAGAAA-3′ (to +2954) for the first intron region. The PCR-amplified DNA products were cloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Mouse clock, per1, per2, and cry1 and hamster bmal1 expression plasmids were kindly donated by Dr. Reppert (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Massachusetts, MA). Luciferase Assay—Reporter vectors were co-transfected with a TK-Renilla luciferase construct into MC3T3-E1, ATDC5, or HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using specific substrates in a luminometer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized by determining the activity of Renilla luciferase. RT-PCR—RT-PCR was conducted as described previously (18Hinoi E. Fujimori S. Yoneda Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA was synthesized with the oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from extracted total RNA. PCR amplification was performed using specific primers (Table 1), and PCR products were subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Promega) for determination of DNA sequences. Although the results obtained by RT-PCR are by definition not quantitative, apparent semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed at cycles below 30 with relatively high linearity using primers for the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for comparative reference. PCR products were quantified by using a densitograph, followed by calculation of the ratios of expression of mRNA for each gene over that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.TABLE 1Primers used for RT-PCRGenesAccession No.Upstream (5′-3′)Downstream (5′-3′)Estimated base pairCol INM_007742GCAATCGGGATCAGTACGAACTTTCACGCCTTTGAAGCCA485Col IINM_031163GGAAAGTCTGGGGAAAGAGGCAGTCCCTGGGTTACCAGAA457Col XNM_009925GCCAGGTCTCAATGGTCCTAAAAAGCAGACACGGGCATAC482OsteocalcinS67455AAGCAGGAGGGCAATAAGGTAGCTGCTGTGACATCCATAC498Runx2NM_009820CCGCACGACAACCGCACCATCGCTCCGGCCCACAAATCTC289OsterixAF184902GGCAGTCACTAAGATCCCACCCAGACTCCATGGCTTTAC563ALPNM_007432GCCCTCTCCAAGACATATACCATGATCACGTCGATATCC373TRAPBC019160ACACAGTGATGCTGTGTGGCAACTCCCAGAGGCTTCCACATATATGATGG465Per1AB002108CCATGGACATGTCTACTAGAGGACCAGGGGACAT982Per2AF036893CTACCTGGTCAAGGTGCAAGAGGGTTTGAATCTTGCCACTGG698Per3AF050182TCCTGATGGTAAGACATTCCAGGCGTGAACAATCACACTCACTT500Brnal1AB015203TCAAGAATGCAAGGGAGGCCAACAGGTAGAGGCGAAGTGCCC599ClockNM_007715CTATGCTTCCTGGTAACGCGGCCTATTATTGGTGGTGCCC718Cry1NM_007771CGTCTGTTTGTGATTCGGGGATTCACGCCACAGGAGTTGC669Cry2NM_009963AGAAGGTGAAGAGGAACAGCACTAGATGTATCGAGAGGGGAAGC515Dec1NM_011498CGTCTGTTTGTGATTCGGGGAACCACTACCGAGACATGCC700Dec2NM_024469ACAGGACAGAAACCTCCAAATCGTCTTTCAGCTGAGCAATGCATTC432DbpNM_016974TCTTTCAGCTGAGCAATGCATTCACGTTCTTCGGGCACCTAGC680 Open table in a new tab Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Gel retardation electrophoresis was conducted as described previously (18Hinoi E.

Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were collected in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.9) containing 10 mm KCl, phosphatase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. Following the addition of 10% Nonidet P-40 to make a final concentration of 0.6%, cells were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. Pellets were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 400 mm KCl and inhibitors for phosphatases and proteases. Suspensions were kept in an ice bath for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants thus obtained were collected as nuclear extracts. Assays were carried out using double-stranded oligonucleotide containing consensus core sequence for the E-box from the Dec1 promoter (5′-CTAGGTCCAACACGTGAGACTCTCGA-3′), type II collagen promoter (5′-ATCCATGGTTGCACGTGGCCCGTGCA-3′), and type II collagen first intron (5′-AATTTTCTTCCACGTGTTTGGGCACG-3′), as a probe labeled by [α-32P]deoxy-ATP for detection of DNA binding activity. After determining protein contents, an aliquot of nuclear extracts was incubated at a fixed amount of 3 μg of protein and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were fixed and dried, followed by exposure to x-ray films for different periods to obtain autoradiograms appropriate for subsequent quantification by a densitograph. Western Blotting—Western blotting was conducted as described previously (18Hinoi E. Fujimori S. Yoneda Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In brief, nuclear extracts prepared from cultured osteoblasts were treated with SDS, and lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, followed by transference to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membranes were then subjected to blocking with skimmed milk, followed by reaction with the anti-phospho-CRE-binding protein (CREB) antibody or the anti-CREB antibody (New England Biolabs). Finally, membranes were reacted with the anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody conjugated with peroxidase and detected with the aid of ECL detection reagents for subsequent exposure to x-ray films. Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was conducted as described previously (18Hinoi E. Fujimori S. Yoneda Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In brief, extracted RNA was resolved on 1% formaldehyde/agarose gel, and transferred onto positively charged nylon transfer membranes. After fixation of RNA to the blot by UV cross-linking, blotted membranes were prehybridized at 68 °C for 1 h, and subsequently hybridized with a denatured DIG-labeled RNA probe of mPer1 at 68 °C for 16 h. Membranes were then washed and incubated with anti-DIG-AP-Fab, followed by incubation with CDP-star and subsequent exposure to x-ray films for appropriate periods to detect chemiluminescence. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP experiments were performed essentially according to the protocol provided with the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) using ATDC5 cells. ATDC5 cells were treated with formaldehyde for cross-linking, followed by sonication in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), followed by extraction of DNA with phenol/chloroform. PCR was performed using sequences found in the 5′-flanking region (–3215 to –2821) and first intron region (+1042 to +1365) of the mouse type II collagen gene, in addition to the mper promoter (–663 to –383), as primers. Data Analysis—Results are all expressed as the mean ± S.E. and statistical significance was determined by two-tailed and unpaired Students' t test or one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni/Dunnett post-hoc test. Rhythmic Expression of Clock Genes and Marker Genes in Bone and Cartilage—To investigate whether mRNA expression for bone and cartilage marker genes exhibit daily rhythms in addition to circadian clock genes, total RNA was obtained from adult ddY mouse femurs every 6 h throughout a single 24-h period, followed by determination of the mRNA levels by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1, all the clock genes (per1, bmal1, dec1, and dbp) examined in this study exhibited 24 h rhythmicity in mouse femurs in vivo. Maximum expression was observed at ZT 12 for Per1, at ZT 16 for dec1 and dbp, and at ZT 18 for bmal1, respectively. The expression of mRNA for type I collagen, type II collagen, and type X collagen similarly exhibited a 24-h rhythm with a peak at ZT 6 and a gradual decrease thereafter up to ZT 18. By contrast, no rhythmic expression was observed in mRNA for the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, or osteocalcin genes in mouse femurs. These genes appear either to be constitutively expressed or to oscillate with amplitudes below statistical significance. Interestingly, mRNA expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) showed a 24-h rhythm with a peak at ZT 12, but no such pattern in osterix mRNA expression. Expression of mRNA for Clock Genes in Bone Cells—To examine whether circadian clock genes are indeed expressed in bone cells, including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes, RT-PCR analysis was conducted using specific primers for each clock gene. For the purpose of preparation of primary osteoclasts devoid of osteoblasts, monocyte/macrophage progenitor cells were cultured for 5 days in the presence of 20 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml RANKL, followed by determination of expression profiles of each clock gene. RT-PCR analysis revealed that expression of mRNA was drastically increased for all the osteoclastic marker genes examined in primary cultured osteoclasts differentiated from hematopoietic progenitors in the presence of both M-CSF and RANKL (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions, bmal1 mRNA was constitutively expressed at each of the differentiation stages, with transient expression of dec1 mRNA 1 day after differentiation induced by RANKL and M-CSF. However, no marked expression was seen for the other molecular clock genes, including clock, per1–3, cry1–2, dbp, and rev-erbα, in cultured osteoclasts throughout the entire range of differentiation stages in primary osteoclasts (Fig. 2B). Moreover, osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 and chondrogenic ATDC5 cells were cultured for 7 days in individual differentiation media, followed by non-quantitative determination of expression of circadian clock genes. Expression of mRNA was seen for all clock genes examined in both MC3T3-E1 and ATDC5 cells cultured for 7 days, in addition to adult mouse hypothalamus used as a positive control (Fig. 2C). Expression Profile of mRNA for Clock Genes in ATDC5 Cells—We next examined the expression profiles of circadian clock genes in ATDC5 cells. ATDC5 cells are chondrogenic cells and gradually display a chondrocytic phenotype in the presence of insulin in proportion to the length of the culture period up to 28 days. Expression of mRNA was markedly increased for type X collagen during culture periods of from 7 to 14 days with a gradual increase thereafter up to 28 days, whereas a relatively steady level of mRNA expression was seen for both type II collagen and Runx2 for a period of up to 28 days (Fig. 3A). Under these conditions, expression of mRNA was drastically decreased for per2, bmal1, and clock from 7 to 14 days with a gradual decline thereafter up to 28 days, whereas mRNA levels were significantly decreased for per1 and cry2 at 28 days. By contrast, expression of dec2 mRNA was markedly increased from 7 to 14 days with a sustained increase up to 28 days. No significant alternation was seen in mRNA for per3, cry1, or dec1 on any day examined. We next examined DNA binding to the E-box sequence in ATDC5 cells cultured for different periods up to 28 days. Consistent with the mRNA expression for both clock and bmal1, DNA binding activity of the E-box was decreased in proportion to the duration of culture from 3 to 28 days (Fig. 3B, a). To verify the nuclear proteins involved in E-box binding, supershift analysis was carried out in nuclear extracts prepared from ATDC5 cells cultured for 14 days using the anti-clock antibody. The anti-clock antibody was effective in inducing an upward shift of the probe-protein complex on gels (Fig. 3B, b). Moreover, E-box binding was completely inhibited by excess unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the E-box sequence, whereas oligonucleotide with mutations of the E-box core sequence did not markedly affect E-box binding even at a molar concentration ratio of 30-fold (Fig. 3B, c). Effect of PTH on Per mRNA Expression in MC3T3-E1 and ATDC5 Cells—To determine whether PTH induces per1 in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 and chondrogenic ATDC5 cells were cultured for 7 days, followed by the addition of 100 nm PTH and subsequent collection of total RNA at different time points after the PTH addition for determination of the mRNA levels by Northern blotting. mPer1 mRNA levels were markedly increased 1 h after the addition of PTH-(1–34), with a recovery to the baseline with in 2 h in both MC3T3-E1 and ATDC5 cells (Fig. 4A), whereas no marked expression was seen at any time point after the addition of PTH-(3–34) (data not shown). The addition of PTH-(1–34) stimulated phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 in ATDC5 cells with maximal phosphorylation at 1 h and a return to the basal level within 4 h, whereas no marked alteration was seen for the expression of CREB at any time point after PTH addition up to 24 h (Fig. 4B). We next determined the effects of different drugs known to affect chondrocytic functions on per expression, in addition to PTH. ATDC5 cells were transfected with a construct of mper promoter regions linked to the luciferase reporter gene, followed by treatment with different drugs for 48 h. Of the drugs tested, the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and PTH induced a significant elevation of mper1 promoter activity, with no significant alternations by other reagents. These included vitamin D3, glutamate, GABA, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, BMP-2, and melatonin (Fig. 4C). In addition, only forskolin significantly elevated mper2 promoter activity in addition to PTH, whereas mper3 promoter activity was not markedly affected by any of the regents examined (data not shown). Effect of PTH on mPer Promoter Activity—ATDC5 cells were transfected with either of the mper promoter constructs and treated with PTH at 10 nm for 48 h. Both mper1 and mper2 promoter activities were significantly increased after exposure to PTH, with no response for the mper3 promoter (Fig. 5A). To examine the possible signaling pathway responsible for mper1 and mper2 transactivation by PTH, cells were transfected with the mper promoter, followed by treatment with the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro31-8220, respectively, 1 h before PTH stimulation. Inhibition of PKA by H89 almost completely blocked transactivation of both the mper1 and mper2 promoters by PTH, whereas the PKC inhibitor slightly but significantly inhibited the promoter activity of mper1 without significantly affecting that of mper2. Moreover, PTH significantly increased the activity of pCRE-luc containing three tandems of CRE. The inhibitor of PKA, but not of PKC, completely inhibited PTH-dependent CRE reporter activity. No marked alternation was found in any promoter activities, including mper1, mper2, and CRE, in the presence of either H89 or Ro31-8220 alone. To determine the element responsive to PTH within the mper promoter region and to identify the ci"

Smad proteins are substrates of the TGF-β type I receptor and are responsible for transducing receptor signals to target genes in the nucleus. The PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) proteins were originally identified as transcriptional co-regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway. Subsequently, cross-talk between the PIAS proteins and other signaling pathways has been shown to be involved in various cellular processes. Importantly, PIAS proteins modulate TGF-β signaling by regulating the transcriptional activity of Smad3. In this study we tested whether hZimp10, a novel PIAS-like protein, acts as other PIAS proteins to regulate Smad3-mediated transcription. We show that expression of exogenous hZimp10 enhances the transcriptional activity of Smad3, which appears to be Smad4-dependent and responsive to TGF-β induction. Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous hZimp10 reduced the transcriptional activity of Smad3. A protein-protein interaction between Smad3 and Smad4 with hZimp10 was identified in glutathione S-transferase-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The Miz domain of hZimp10 and the MH2 domains of Smad3 and Smad4 were mapped as the regions responsible for binding. Results from immunostaining assays further demonstrated that Smad3, Smad4, and hZimp10 co-localize within cell nuclei. Finally, we demonstrated that Smad3/4-mediated transcription is significantly impaired in response to TGF-β induction in Zimp10 null (zimp10-/-) embryonic fibroblasts. Taken together, these results provide the first line of evidence to demonstrate a role for Zimp10 in regulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.

Das P. Krishna S. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TGF-β and related factors activate signaling by binding and bringing together members of two subfamilies of transmembrane protein serine/threonine kinases, the type I (TβR-I) and type II receptors (TβR-II). Smad proteins are the substrates of TGF-β type I receptor and play a central role in transducing receptor signals to target genes in the nucleus (2Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). The Smads can be loosely grouped into three categories. Smad2 and Smad3 are substrates and mediators of the related TGF-β and activin receptors, whereas Smad4 acts as a cofactor for the receptor-regulated Smads. Smad6 and 7, termed anti-Smads, inhibit the signaling function of the other two groups (3Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar).Recent studies have shown that Smad proteins can modulate transcription through interactions with other transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors (4Datto M. Wang X.F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For instance, Smad3 and Smad4 interact with multiple members of the AP1 family (5Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Qing J. Zhang Y. Derynck R.

The interaction between Smads, p300/CBP, and p300/CBP-associated factor may dictate promoter specificity and mediate signal integration (7Itoh S. Itoh F. Goumans M.J. Ten Dijke P. Eur. J.

Smads also associate with other transcription factors including SP1 and leukemia inhibitory factor and allow for a higher level of promoter specificity and transcription activity (9Feng X.H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y.W. Yasui N. Ito K. Huang G. Fujii M. Hanai J. Nogami H. Ochi T. Miyazono K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Shi Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2546-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 can interact with the nuclear oncoproteins SnoN and Ski to repress transcription (12Sun Y. Liu X. Ng-Eaton E. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Smad2/Smad4 complexes can recruit histone deacetylase to promoters through association with the homeodomain protein, 5′ TG 3′ interacting factor, and Sin3A (14Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J.

Recently, several lines of evidence have shown that Smad3 can be regulated directly or indirectly by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and AKT signaling pathways (16Conery A.R. Cao Y. Thompson E.A.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). PIAS1 and PIAS3 have been shown to inhibit the activity of STAT1 and STAT3, respectively (19Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 20Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have suggested that the PIAS proteins may play a more general role in regulating chromatin structure (22Dobreva G. Dambacher J. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3048-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). An increased interest has been focused on the role of PIAS proteins in sumoylation (23Schmidt D. Muller S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2561-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has shown that the SUMO E3 ligase RING domain shares significant homology with the Miz domain of PIAS proteins (24Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Moreover, PIASxα, -xβ, -1, and -3 have been found to interact with SUMO-1 and Ubc9 and mediate the sumoylation of p53 and steroid hormone receptors (25Jackson P.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41311-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Recent studies have shown that PIAS proteins interact with the TGFβ/Smad pathway. PIASy was reported to repress the transcriptional activity of Smad3, and this repressive effect was due to enhanced recruitment of HDAC1 (32Long J. Matsuura I. He D. Wang G. Shuai K. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9791-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, PIAS3 showed an opposite effect, enhancing Smad3-mediated transcription (33Long J. Wang G. Matsuura I. He D. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The RING domain of PIAS3 can interact with the transcriptional co-activator p300/CBP and form a ternary complex with Smad3. Moreover, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and PIAS proteins have been shown to enhance the sumoylation of Smad4 (34Lee P.S. Chang C. Liu D. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27853-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The sumoylation of Smad4 by PIAS proteins is regulated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (35Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50833-50842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).hZimp10 is a novel PIAS-like protein (36Sharma M. Li X. Wang Y. Zarnegar M. Huang C.Y. Palvimo J.J. Lim B. Sun Z. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6101-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It shares a ring finger domain, termed Miz (msx-interacting zinc finger), with other PIAS proteins (37Wu L. Wu H. Ma L. Sangiorgi F. Wu N. Bell J.R. Lyons G.E. Maxson R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which appears to be important for protein-protein interactions. A novel Drosophila gene, termed tonalli (tna), was identified recently and is the ortholog of hZimp10 (38Gutierrez L. Zurita M. Kennison J.A. Vazquez M. Development. 2003; 130: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by tna genetically interacts with the chromatin remodeling complexes SWI2/SNF2 and the Mediator complex, suggesting that it may play a role in transcription. In this study, we tested whether hZimp10 affects Smad3-mediated transcription in a manner similar to that of the PIAS proteins. Using several in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that Zimp10 interacts with Smad3/4 proteins and augments Smad-mediated transcription, which provides the first line of evidence that Zimp10 plays a critical role in the regulation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—The pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad3 and pcMV5-FLAG-Smad4 expression vectors were described previously (39Hayes S.A.

Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged Smad4 expression plasmid was constructed by inserting the full-length Smad4 cDNA into pcDNA3 with an N-terminal HA epitope tag (Invitrogen). Various deletion mutants of Smad3 and Smad4 were cloned into pGEX vectors (Amersham Biosciences). The pGEX4T1-Smad4 and 3TP-Luc were kindly provided by Dr. Joan Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). pSV-β-gal, an SV40 driven β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI), was used in this study as an internal control. The pcDNA3-hZimp10, pcDNA3-FLAG-hZimp10, and pcDNA3-FLAG-hZimp7 were generated as described previously (36Sharma M. Li X. Wang Y. Zarnegar M. Huang C.Y. Palvimo J.J. Lim B. Sun Z.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2915-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The fragments of hZimp10, including the N terminus (amino acids 1-333), Miz domain (amino acids 728-809), and C terminus (amino acids 932-1064), were generated by PCR with appropriate primers and subcloned in-frame to the pGEX4T3 for making GST fusion proteins. The hZimp10 mutants containing double point mutations (C755G/H757A and C760G/H762A) within the Miz domain were generated by a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis approach in the pcDNA3-FLAG vector. The pGEX4T3-PIASxα/ARIP3 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. J Palvimo (Helsinki, Finland).Cell Cultures and Transient Transfections—A monkey kidney cell line, CV-1, a human prostate cancer cell line, PC3, a human colon cancer cell line, SW480.7, and a human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 or 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Denver, CO). Transient transfections were carried out using a LipofectAMINE2000 kit (Invitrogen). Approximately 1.5 × 104 cells were seeded into a 48-well plate 16 h before transfection. 300 ng of total plasmid DNA and 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine2000 per well were used in the transfection. The total amount of plasmid per well was equalized by the addition of pcDNA3 or pBluescript empty vector. Approximately 48 h after transfection, luciferase activity was measured as relative light units in a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The relative light units from individual transfections were normalized by β-galactosidase activity in the same samples. Individual transfection experiments were done in triplicate, and the results are reported as mean relative light units/β-galactosidase (±S.D.) from representative experiments.GST Pulldown Assay—Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed as described previously (42Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Li X. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35200-35208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The full-length Smad3, Smad4, and hZimp10 proteins were generated and labeled in vitro by the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with the radiolabeled proteins at 4 °C for 2 h in a modified binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 180 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% dry nonfat milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Beads were carefully washed 3 times with 500 μl of binding buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The HA-tagged pcDNA3-hZimp10 expression plasmid, alone or with a FLAG-tagged pcDNA3-Smad3 and/or FLAG-tagged pCMV5-Smad4 expression plasmids, was transfected into CV-1 cells. Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h and then harvested in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm NaF. Lysates were clarified by incubation on ice and centrifugation for 5 min. Four hundred μl of clarified lysate from each sample was precleared for 20 min with 10 μl of protein-A-Sepharose beads bound to 1 μg of normal mouse IgG (Pharmacia). Precleared lysates were then incubated with pre-equilibrated protein-A-Sepharose beads with either normal mouse IgG or FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed 3 times in 500 μl of lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) and blocked overnight at 4 °C in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.08% Tween 20) with 5% lowfat milk. Membranes were probed with HA, FLAG, Smad3, Smad4, or the hZimp10 antibody at the appropriate dilutions. Anti-rabbit, mouse, or chicken IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used as secondary antibodies (Promega). Detection was performed with ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol using ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences).Immunostaining—CV-1 or PC3 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3-hZimp10, FLAG-tagged pcDNA3-Smad3, and HA-tagged pcDNA3-Smad4 in the presence or absence of TGF-β 1 growth factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Specific primary antibodies and Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were acquired using a confocal microscope.Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—Mice heterozygous for a neomycin-disrupted allele of the Zimp10 gene were mated, and females were sacrificed at 9.5 days post-coitus. Embryos were isolated in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in 250 μl of trypsin (0.05%) for 10 min at 37 °C with intermittent agitation. Embryos were disrupted by pipetting and then added to at least a 3× volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were directly plated into 6- or 48-well plates, allowed to adhere overnight, and used for assays. To determine the mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) genotype, embryo sacs isolated during the dissection were digested, genomic DNA was extracted, and the wild type or mutant Zimp10 alleles were PCR-amplified using specific primers.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Assay— Mouse embryo fibroblasts were established as described above and serum-starved overnight. TGF-β1 was then added directly to the media to achieve a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. 5.5 h after stimulation, total RNA was isolated using RNABee (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood, TX). The RT-PCR method was carried out as described previously (43Sun Z. Yergeau D.A. Tuypens T. Tavernier J. Paul C.C. Baumann M.A. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1462-1471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from 1-5 μg of total RNA with 9 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) using 0.1 μm oligo-dT primer in a total volume of 20 μl. One μl of cDNA was added to a standard PCR mix containing 1 μm concentrations of each primer. The PCR reaction was performed on a thermal cycler using 26-30 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 58 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 50 s at 72 °C for PAI-1. The final polymerization step was extended an additional 10 min at 72 °C. Primers for PAI-1 (5′-TCATCAATGACTGGGTGGAA-3′;5′-CTGCTCTTGGTCGGAAAGAC-3′) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′; 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′) were synthesized and used in the PCR reactions.RESULTShZimp10 Augments Smad3-mediated Transcription—PIAS proteins have been shown to regulate TGF-β/Smad3 activity. Here, we investigated a possible role for hZimp10 (36Sharma M. Li X. Wang Y. Zarnegar M. Huang C.Y. Palvimo J.J. Lim B. Sun Z. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6101-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and hZimp7 (41Huang C.Y. Beliakoff J. Li X. Lee J. Li X. Sharma M. Lim B. Sun Z. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2915-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), novel PIAS-like proteins, in regulating Smad3-mediated transcription. A plasmid containing the TGF-β-inducible luciferase reporter (3TP-Luc) was co-transfected into CV-1 cells with plasmids expressing Smad3, hZimp7, hZimp10, or PIASxα.An ∼5-fold induction of Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity was observed when cells were transfected with Smad3 (Fig. 1A). Smad3 activity was enhanced ∼2-fold in the presence of 60 ng of hZimp10, and this enhancement was dose-dependent. In contrast, co-transfection of hZimp7 and PIASxα showed no significant effect (Fig. 1A). There was no effect when only hZimp7, hZimp10, or PIASxα was transfected alone with the reporter plasmid (data not shown). These results indicate that hZimp10, but not hZimp7 or PIASxα, augments Smad3-mediated transcription.Previous studies have shown that Smad4 can form a heterodimer with Smad3, which can then translocate into the nucleus to activate the transcriptional response (44Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 45Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). To test whether the enhancement of hZimp10 is mediated through the transcriptionally active Smad3/Smad4 complex, we repeated the transient transfection assays presented in Fig. 1A in the presence of a Smad4 expression vector. As shown in Fig. 1B, Smad4 increases Smad3-mediated transcription by nearly 30%, and hZimp10 further enhances Smad3/4-mediated transcription to ∼0.6-1.2-fold. Again, no enhancement was observed with hZimp7 or PIASxα. To further confirm that hZimp10 enhances the activity of the Smad3/Smad4 transcriptional complex, we repeated the above experiments in the Smad4-negative cell line SW480.7. As expected, overexpression of Smad3 showed no significant transcriptional activity on 3TP-Luc in this human colon cancer cell line (Fig. 1C). There was also no significant effect of hZimp10 on Smad3-mediated transcription. However, expression of exogenous Smad4 resulted in a dosage-dependent enhancement of Smad3-mediated transcription. In the presence of Smad4, hZimp10 further increased the activity of 3TP-luc in a dosage-dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that hZimp10 can enhance the activity of the Smad3/Smad4 transcriptionally active complex.Previous studies have demonstrated that TGF-β signals are transmitted through Smad proteins (2Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar, 46Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). To determine whether enhancement of Smad3/4 by hZimp10 is induced by TGF-β, we repeated the transfection experiments with serum-free medium with or without TGF-β1 in HEK293 cells, which respond to TGF-β induction. As shown in Fig. 1D, there was only a slight increase in luciferase activity in cells transfected with Smad3 and Smad4 expression vectors in the absence of TGF-β1. However, co-transfection of hZimp10 with Smad3 and 4 resulted in 20-50% increased luciferase activity in cells treated with TGF-β1 (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that hZimp10 affects TGF-β-induced Smad3/4-mediated transcription.Next, we investigated the involvement of endogenous hZimp10 in regulating the transcriptional activity of the Smad3/Smad4 complex. We first generated three short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs for hZimp10 (47Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar E. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) and tested their knockdown effects on ectopically expressed hZimp10 in CV-1 cells (Fig. 2A). All three hZimp10 shRNA constructs reduced the expression of FLAG-tagged hZimp10 protein. There was no change in tubulin expression, confirming the specificity of the hZimp10 shRNAs. Particularly, the hZimp10 shRNA construct 2 appeared most effective in this knockdown experiment. In addition, this construct also diminished hZimp10 enhancement of Smad3/Smad4-mediated transcription (Fig. 2C). A t test showed that the hZimp10 shRNA-mediated knockdown effect is significant (p < 0.05). Using this construct, we further tested the role of endogenous hZimp10 on Smad3/4-mediated transcription in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the hZimp10 shRNA2 significantly reduced the expression of the endogenous protein. This knockdown effect resulted in an ∼35 or 50% reduction in Smad3/4-mediated transcription at 15 or 45 ng of the shRNA2 construct, respectively (Fig. 2D). Taken together, the above data indicate an important role for endogenous hZimp10 in augmenting the activity of the Smad3/Smad4 transcriptional complex.FIGURE 2Knockdown of hZimp10 expression reduces Smad3/4-mediated transcription. A, CV-1 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG-hZimp10 (F-hZimp10) and 200 ng of different pBluescript (pBS)/U6-hZimp10-shRNA constructs (Z1, Z2, and Z3) or pBS/U6 vector only in 6-well plates. Whole cell lysates were prepared after 48 h of transfection and analyzed by Western blotting with either FLAG or tubulin antibody. B, different hZimp10 shRNA constructs or pBS/U6 vector were transfected into HEK293 cells. Cells were harvested, and cell lysates were analyzed as described in A. C, CV1 cells were transfected with different amounts of plasmids as indicated in the figure. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured in whole cell lysates as described above. The asterisk indicates that the data are significantly different by t test (p < 0.05). D, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected in 48-well plates with 100 ng of 3TP-Luc, 25 ng of pSV40-β-gal, 8 ng of pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad3, 4 ng of pCMV5-FLAG-Smad4, and 15 or 45 ng of hZimp10 shRNA. The shRNA vector backbone was used as a control. The data showing statistical significance is marked with an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Miz Domain of hZimp10 Is Involved in the Interaction with Smad3 and Smad4 Proteins—Previous reports suggest that the Miz domain plays a role in interacting with target proteins (37Wu L. Wu H. Ma L. Sangiorgi F. Wu N. Bell J.R. Lyons G.E. Maxson R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Particularly, it has been shown that the Miz domain of PIAS3 and PIASy is responsible for interacting with the Smad3 and Smad4 proteins (32Long J. Matsuura I. He D. Wang G. Shuai K. Liu F. Proc.

To directly assess the involvement of the hZimp10 Miz domain in the interaction with Smad3 and Smad4, we performed in vitro GST-pulldown assays. [35S]Methionine-labeled full-length Smad3 or Smad4 bound to different GST-hZimp10 fusion proteins or GST protein alone was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3A, Smad3 and Smad4 proteins bound to GST-PIASxα/ARIP3, which was used as a positive control. Importantly, a weak interaction was observed in samples containing GST-hZimp10-Miz (amino acids 728-809) but not with GST-hZimp10-N′ (amino acids 1-333), GST-hZimp10-C′ (amino acids 932-1064), or GST beads alone. Next, we used two hZimp10 Miz domain mutants that contain double point mutations, Mut1 (C755G/H757A) and Mut2 (C760G/H762A), to further assess the importance of the Miz domai"
https://openalex.org/W2006096630,"The osmotic response element-binding protein (OREBP), also known as tonicity enhancer-binding protein (TonEBP) or NFAT5, regulates the hypertonicity-induced expression of a battery of genes crucial for the adaptation of mammalian cells to extracellular hypertonic stress. The activity of OREBP/TonEBP is regulated at multiple levels, including nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. OREBP/TonEBP protein can be detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus under isotonic conditions, although it accumulates exclusively in the nucleus or cytoplasm when subjected to hypertonic or hypotonic challenges, respectively. Using immunocytochemistry and green fluorescent protein fusions, the protein domains that determine its subcellular localization were identified and characterized. We found that OREBP/TonEBP nuclear import is regulated by a nuclear localization signal. However, under isotonic conditions, nuclear export of OREBP/TonEBP is mediated by a CRM1-dependent, leucine-rich canonical nuclear export sequence (NES) located in the N terminus. Disruption of NES by site-directed mutagenesis yielded a mutant OREBP/TonEBP protein that accumulated in the nucleus under isotonic conditions but remained a target for hypotonicity-induced nuclear export. More importantly, a putative auxiliary export domain distal to the NES was identified. Disruption of the auxiliary export domain alone is sufficient to abolish the nuclear export of OREBP/TonEBP induced by hypotonicity. By using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, we showed that CRM1 interacts with OREBP/TonEBP, but not with a mutant protein deficient in NES. Our findings provide insight into how nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of OREBP/TonEBP is regulated by changes in extracellular tonicity.

Our findings provide insight into how nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of OREBP/TonEBP is regulated by changes in extracellular tonicity. The exposure of mammalian cells to extracellular hypertonicity elicits a genetic program of adaptive cellular responses, which includes the synthesis and accumulation of organic osmolytes such as sorbitol, betaine, and myoinositol (1Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) to replace intracellular electrolytes that are otherwise deleterious to normal cellular function (2Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Hypertonicity also induces the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70) (3Neuhofer W. Beck F.X. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 531-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that acts as a molecular chaperone to protect cells from osmotic stress-induced apoptosis (4Shim E.H. Kim J.I. Bang E.S. Heo J.S.

The accumulation of organic osmolytes is brought about by the induction of a battery of genes, including aldose reductase (AR), betaine/γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (BGT-1), and Na+-dependent myoinositol transporter (SMIT), which is responsible for the synthesis of sorbitol and the uptake of betaine and myoinositol, respectively. The hypertonic induction of these genes, including HSP-70, is controlled at the transcriptional level and is mediated by a common cisacting element known as the osmotic response element or the TonE (tonicity-responsive enhancer) (5Woo S.K.

OREBP/TonEBP was also shown to be identical in sequence to NFAT5, a protein independently identified as a member of the NFAT family of transcription factors (11Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, unlike other members of the NFAT family, such as NFATc1-4 (12Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar), OREBP/TonEBP lacks the calcineurin binding domain and is therefore not regulated by Ca2+ and calcineurin. It also does not form a cooperative complex with Fos and Jun for DNA binding. Therefore, OREBP/TonEBP is regarded as a distant member of the NFAT family (11Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). OREBP/TonEBP is regulated at multiple levels.

In addition, hypertonicity increases the phosphorylation of OREBP/TonEBP as well as the activity of its transactivation domain (14Lee S.D. Colla E. Sheen M.R. Na K.Y. Kwon H.M. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the identification of specific phosphorylation site(s) and the evidence directly showing whether phosphorylation is required for its transcriptional activation activity remain elusive (14Lee S.D.

It appears that the proteasome is involved in the hypertonicity-induced nuclear translocation of OREBP/TonEBP, as the prevention of its nuclear accumulation using a proteasome inhibitor blocked hypertonic induction of SMIT and BGT-1(17Woo S.K.

Apparently the nuclear translocation is bi-directional, because hypotonicity reduces the nuclear staining of OREBP/TonEBP (13Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F1006-F1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we identify and characterize three protein motifs, including a nuclear export sequence (NES), a putative auxiliary export domain (AED), and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), that are responsible for OREBP/TonEBP nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in response to changes in extracellular tonicity. These results provide a better understanding of the mechanism of tonicity-regulated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of OREBP/TonEBP. Plasmid Constructs—Human OREBP/TonEBP cDNA clone KIAA0827 was a gift from Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan). FLAG-OREBPWT, FLAG-OREBP1-581, FLAG-OREBP1-581Δ1-131, and FLAG-OREBP1-581Δ1-156 were derived by in-frame insertion of KIAA0827 cDNA corresponding to amino acid residues 1-1531, 1-581, 132-581, and 157-581 into NotI and BamHI restriction sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 mammalian expression vector (Sigma), respectively. FLAG-OREBP1-581Δ132-156 was derived by in-frame insertion of the cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 1-131 into the NotI restriction site of FLAG-OREBP1-581Δ1-156. FLAG-OREBP1-581L4A, FLAG-OREBP1-581RKR202-204AAA, and FLAG-OREBP1-581KRR213-215AAA were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using FLAG-OREBP1-581 as template. To construct the OREBP-GFP chimeras, OREBP/TonEBP cDNAs corresponding to amino acid residues 1-581 and 157-581 were cloned in-frame into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), respectively. CRM1 cDNA (OriGene Technologies, Inc.) was cloned in-frame into Myc tag expression vector pCMV-Tag-3C (Stratagene). A newly engineered fluorescent protein, Venus (18Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar), was used for the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis. The cDNA encoding N-terminal residues 1-172 (VN173) and C-terminal residues 155-238 (VC155) of Venus were subcloned into pHA-CMV (Clontech) vectors to make BiFC cloning vectors. pHA-CRM1566-720VN was constructed as described (19Liu H. Deng X. Shyu Y.J. Li J.J. Taparowsky E.J. Hu C.D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1058-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). OREBP1-581VC and OREBP1-581L4AVC were derived by in-frame insertion of the OREBP/TonEBP mutants to VC155. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Cultures and Transfection—HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For OREBP/TonEBP subcellular localization studies, cells grown in 6-well plates to 50% confluence were transfected with 0.3-0.5 μg of the plasmids expressing the proteins as indicated in each experiment using GeneJuice (Novagen) or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Transfected cells were incubated for 16-24 h in complete growth medium before switching to medium with different osmolality. Hypotonic (250 mosmol/kg H2O), isotonic (300 mosmol/kg H2O), or hypertonic (450 mosmol/kg H2O) medium was prepared by supplementing NaCl to NaCl-deficient growth medium (5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, 1× minimum Eagle's medium amino acids solution, and 1× vitamin solution (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, pH 7.4) to the desired osmolality. Medium osmolality was measured by the Vapro® vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor). For nuclear export assays, cells were either left untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B (Sigma) for the indicated times and osmolality. For cycloheximide studies, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml cycloheximide for the indicated time. Immunofluorescence, Green Fluorescence Microscopy, and BiFC Analysis—Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% w/v paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were permeabilized with absolute methanol for 2 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), TonEBP (a kind gift from Prof. H. M. Kwon, University of Maryland), or Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. The fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) or TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. To visualize the nuclei, the cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma). Expression of GFP fusion proteins was determined by green fluorescence microscopy. For BiFC analysis, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding VN and VC fusion proteins. HA-ECFP vector was cotransfected as an internal control to measure the BiFC efficiency of fragments derived from Venus. Cells were incubated for 16 h before analysis. Yellow fluorescent protein emission of the VN155 and VC173 complexes was measured at 520 ± 10 nm during excitation at 490 ± 15 nm. CFP fluorescence was measured at 470 ± 15 nm during excitation at 436 ± 5 nm. The fluorescent images were captured using an Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope fitted with a SPOT RT digital camera (Diagnostic Instrument, Inc., Melville, NY). The intensity of fluorescence of the individual cell was quantified using an automated intensity recognition feature of Metamorph II (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). The median of the Venus/CFP ratio was used to calculate the fold increase of BiFC efficiency as a better measure for highly skewed distribution (20Shyu Y.J. Liu H. Deng X. Hu C.D. BioTechniques. 2006; 40: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Western Blotting Analysis—Expression of recombinant proteins was also confirmed by Western blotting analysis of total cell extracts. At 16 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors. After being rotated at 4 °C for 20 min, the cell lysates were cleared by high speed centrifugation at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as total cell extracts. For immunoblotting, the total cell extracts (10 mg/lane) were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), or anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) antibodies as indicated. Anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used as secondary antibodies. TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 was used for washing the membranes. Blots were developed with ECL™ Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). OREBP/TonEBP Undergoes Nucleocytoplasmic Trafficking in Response to Changes in Tonicity, but the C-terminal Transactivation Domain Is Not Required for This Process—OREBP/TonEBP consists of an N-terminal transactivation domain (AD1, amino acids 1-76) (14Lee S.D. Colla E. Sheen M.R. Na K.Y. Kwon H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47571-47577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a putative bipartite NLS (amino acids 199-216), a Rel-homologous DNA binding domain that shares significant homology with the NFAT family of transcription factors (amino acids 264-543) (10Ko B.C. Turck C.W. Lee K.W. Yang Y. Chung S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), followed by an extended glutamine-rich transactivation domain at the C terminus, which can be further divided into multiple modulation and activation domains (AD2, amino acids 618-1476) (Fig. 1A) (14Lee S.D. Colla E. Sheen M.R. Na K.Y. Kwon H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47571-47577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with anti-OREBP/TonEBP antibodies showed that hypertonicity increases the nuclear staining of OREBP/TonEBP (9Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), whereas the staining was reduced substantially when cells were subjected to prolonged hypotonic treatment (18 h) (13Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F1006-F1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that OREBP/TonEBP activity may be regulated by nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. To examine the mechanism of OREBP/TonEBP nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, we sought to identify the protein domains that were responsible for its nuclear import and export. The structural organization of wild type OREBP/TonEBP and that of the deletion mutants created for this study are depicted (Fig. 1A). We transiently expressed FLAG-tagged wild type OREBP/TonEBP (FLAG-OREBPWT) cDNA in HeLa cells, and we determined its subcellular localization under different extracellular tonicity conditions. As shown in Fig. 1B, indirect immunofluorescence analysis using fluorescein-tagged FLAG antibodies showed that under isotonicity, a majority of the transfected cells (∼50%) exhibited cytoplasmic fluorescence, whereas the remaining cells showed either pan-cellular (∼30%) or nucleoplasmic (∼20%) fluorescence. However, the fluorescence signal was found exclusively in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus when cells were challenged with hypotonicity or hypertonicity, respectively. The presence of cycloheximide did not alter the hypotonicity- or hypertonicity-induced subcellular localization of FLAG-OREBPWT, suggesting that the observed translocation of FLAG-OREBPWT was because of bona fide nucleocytoplasmic trafficking rather than de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the transactivation domain AD2 contains protein motif(s) responsible for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, a mutant OREBP/TonEBP lacking AD2 (FLAG-OREBP1-581) was generated (Fig. 1A). Similar to the findings with the FLAG-OREBPWT protein, the majority of FLAG-OREBP1-581 was detected in the cytoplasm when cells were maintained in isotonic medium, whereas hypotonicity or hypertonicity led to cytoplasmic or nuclear localization, respectively (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate that this AD2-deficient OREBP/TonEBP can be subjected to nucleocytoplasmic trafficking similar to the exogenous protein in response to changes in tonicity, OREBP1-581 was fused to GFP (OREBP1-581-GFP), and the localization of the resultant fusion protein was assessed (Fig. 1A). OREBP1-581-GFP was found to undergo nucleocytoplasmic trafficking similar to that of FLAG-OREBPWT in response to the changes in tonicity. On the other hand, GFP alone was found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of transfected cells, and its localization did not alter with changes in tonicity (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis showed that the FLAG-OREBPWT, FLAG-OREBP1-581, and OREBP1-581-GFP proteins were correctly expressed (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these data suggested that the first 581 amino acid residues of OREBP/TonEBP contain essential protein domain(s) required for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. A Nuclear Import Signal Is Responsible for OREBP/TonEBP Nuclear Import—Next we addressed whether the isotonic distribution of OREBP is also actively regulated, i.e. whether the resting localization represents a steady state of continuous import and export. Because the size of OREBP/TonEBP (>180 kDa) precludes a passive nuclear transport mechanism (21Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), we investigated whether it underwent active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling under isotonic conditions. Large proteins shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes by virtue of their NLS and NES, which are recognized by specific import and export receptors, respectively (22Suntharalingam M. Wente S.R. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 775-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). A motif scan of its amino acid sequence revealed that OREBP/TonEBP, similar to many other nuclearly targeted proteins, contains a consensus bipartite NLS (amino acids 199-216) where two clusters of basic amino acids, residues 202-204 (RKR) and residues 213-215 (KRR), were aligned in tandem (Fig. 2A) (23Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). To assess the importance of these two clusters of basic amino acids in the identified NLS sequence, we constructed two mutants of FLAG-OREBP1-581, FLAG-OREBP1-581RKR202-204AAA and FLAG-OREBP1-581KRR213-215AAA, where the first or second clusters of basic amino acids were mutated to alanines, respectively (Fig. 2A). The mutation at the first basic cluster completely abolished nuclear localization of OREBP/TonEBP when cells were treated with hypertonicity (Fig. 2B). In contrast, mutation of the second basic cluster had no effect on subcellular localization of the mutant protein (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that only the first basic cluster contributes to the nuclear import of OREBP/TonEBP, and therefore the identified NLS is a monopartite NLS. A CRM-1-responsive Nuclear Export Signal Is Responsible for OREBP/TonEBP Nuclear Export under Isotonic Conditions—To examine the presence of functional NES in OREBP/TonEBP, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-OREBP1-581 or OREBP1-581-GFP and treated with leptomycin B (LMB) (24Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor exportin-1 (CRM1) (25Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 26Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, under isotonic conditions in the absence of LMB, FLAG-OREBP1-581 and OREBP1-581-GFP proteins were detected in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments within HeLa cells (isotonic, -LMB). The addition of LMB led to the nuclear retention of both proteins (Fig. 3A, isotonic, +LMB), suggesting that OREBP/TonEBP is subjected to active nuclear export in a CRM1-dependent manner. To examine if LMB also blocks hypotonicity-induced OREBP/TonEBP nuclear export, HeLa cells were first subjected to hypertonic conditions in the presence of LMB to induce nuclear translocation of the FLAG and GFP fusion proteins. This was followed by moving the cells to a hypotonic medium to induce nuclear export in the presence or absence of LMB. FLAG-OREBP1-581 and OREBP1-581-GFP were found to localize exclusively in the nucleus when cells were treated with hypertonic medium (data not shown) and localized entirely in the cytoplasm when switched to hypotonic medium in the absence of LMB (Fig. 3A, hypotonic, -LMB). Interestingly, LMB failed to prevent hypotonicity-induced nuclear export of FLAG-OREBP1-581 and OREBP1-581-GFP (Fig. 3A, hypotonic, +LMB). The inhibition of the nuclear export of OREBP/TonEBP by LMB indicated that the protein may contain a NES. Canonical NESs contain a stretch of hydrophobic residues, predominantly leucine and isoleucine, separated by a short spacer of 1-4 amino acids (25Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). We searched for putative nuclear export sequences in OREBP/TonEBP using the NES prediction server, NetNES (27la Cour T. Kiemer L. Molgaard A. Gupta R. Skriver K. Brunak S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Analysis of the human OREBP/TonEBP sequence revealed one core region containing four leucine residues (leucine 8, 9, 13, and 15) with a NES motif score of >0.5. Furthermore, analysis of this leucine-rich sequence revealed the presence of a NES domain (amino acid 8-15) similar to other well characterized NESs, including Rev, p53, c-ABL, and Ran-BP1 (Fig. 3B). To test the functional relevance of this putative NES, we generated an OREBP/TonEBP mutant, in which the four consensus leucine residues in the core NES were substituted with alanines (FLAG-OREBP1-581L4A) (Fig. 3C). Unlike FLAG-OREBP1-581, FLAG-OREBP1-581L4A was localized to the nucleus under isotonic conditions (Fig. 3D, isotonic), suggesting that the putative NES is a functional NES motif. However, similar to FLAG-OREBP1-581, FLAG-OREBP1-581L4A was subjected to hypotonicity-induced nuclear export (Fig. 3D, hypotonic). Nuclear export was not inhibited by the addition of LMB (data not shown). Moreover, cycloheximide did not alter the subcellular localization of FLAG-OREBP1-581L4A under hypotonic conditions (data not shown), and therefore the observed cytoplasmic signal was because of bona fide nuclear export. Collectively, these data suggested that nuclear export of OREBP/TonEBP under isotonic conditions is a NES-dependent process mediated by CRM1, whereas hypotonicity-induced nuclear export is mediated by the NES- and CRM1-independent process. Identification of a Protein Domain That Is Critical for Hypotonicity-induced Nuclear Export—To identify the functional domain responsible for hypotonicity-induced nuclear export, we generated deletion mutants of FLAG-OREBP1-581 (Fig. 4A) and determined the subcellular localization of these mutants under different tonicities. HeLa cells expressing these mutants were transferred to hypotonic, isotonic, or hypertonic medium, respectively, and the subcellular localization of the mutant proteins was recorded and scored quantitatively (Fig. 4B). Representative pictures of the mutant proteins under different culture conditions are shown in Fig. 4C. As expected, FLAG-OREBP1-581 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm (98%) or to the nucleus (95%) under hypotonic or hypertonic conditions, respectively, whereas the majority of the FLAG signal was cytoplasmic (54%) and pan-cellular (28%) under isotonic conditions. However, FLAG-OREBP1-581Δ1-131 (with the first 131 amino acids including the canonical NES deleted) was predominantly localized to the nucleus (79%) under isotonic conditions, whereas its subcellular localization under hypotonic (95% cytoplasmic; 5% nuclear) and hypertonic conditions (3% cytoplasmic, 97% nuclear) was similar to that of FLAG-OREBP1-581. Similar to the FLAG-OREBP1-581L4A, cycloheximide did not alter the subcellular localization of FLAG-OREBP1-581Δ1-131 under hypotonic conditions (data not shown), and therefore the observed cytoplasmic signal was because of bona fide nuclear export. Remarkably, an OREBP/TonEBP mutant with the first 156 amino acids removed (FLAG-OREBP1-581Δ1-156) localized almost exclusively to the nucleus even in hypotonic medium (2% cytoplasmic, 89% nuclear), which suggested that amino acids residues 132-156 contained a protein domain that is necessary for the hypotonicity-induced nuclear export. Similarly, the GFP chimera of this mutant, OREBP1-581Δ1-156-GFP (Fig. 4A), also exhibited constitutive localization to the nucleus (Fig. 4D). To further examine the role of this protein domain in OREBP/TonEBP nuclear export, we generated mutant FLAG-OREBP1-581 Δ132-156 (Fig. 4A). Similar to the FLAG-OREBP1-581Δ1-156, this mutant protein was also constitutively localized to the nucleus under isotonic conditions and remained predominantly nuclear (2% cytoplasmic, 85% nuclear) when the cells were challenged with hypotonic medium (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, deletion of this protein domain alone was sufficient to abrogate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of OREBP/TonEBP, as this mutant was predominantly localized to the nucleus under isotonic conditions. Taken together these data demonstrated the presence of a putative auxiliary export domain (composed of amino acids 1"

ADAM10 substrates have been found at cell-cell contacts and are apparently involved in cell-cell interaction and cell migration. Here we have investigated the cellular mechanism that guides ADAM10 to substrates at cell-cell contacts. We demonstrate that intracellular trafficking of ADAM10 critically requires a novel sorting signal within its cytoplasmic domain.

The release of the extracellular domain of cell adhesion proteins, which contains the homophilic binding sites, disengages cell-cell contact and supports cell migration and proliferation. The inhibition of ectodomain shedding promotes fibroblast adhesion through stabilization of focal adhesion contacts, accompanied by increased cell surface levels of N-cadherin (5Ho A.T. Voura E.B.

Furthermore, for several ADAM substrates not only is the release of the ectodomain functionally relevant but the resulting membrane-bound C-terminal fragments are substrates for regulated intramembrane proteolysis (6Haass C.

In some cases these intracellular fragments are involved in signal transduction as has been shown for Notch1-4, N-cadherin, CD44, ErbB4, and the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase κ (8Kopan R.

Regulation of intramembrane proteolysis is thought to occur at least in part at the level of ectodomain shedding, because shedding is known to be a prerequisite for the subsequent intramembraneous cut (11Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 12Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann C.E. Sudhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Specifically, ADAM10, which represents a major α-secretase activity (13Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R.

A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), plays an important role in shedding of Alzheimer disease β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP). Alzheimer disease is characterized by excessive deposition of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in the brain parenchyma. Aβ is generated from βAPP by proteolytic processing involving β- and γ-secretase (6Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The competitive non-amyloidogenic pathway, where βAPP is initially cleaved by α-secretase within the amyloid domain, prevents Aβ generation (14Hung A.Y. Haass C. Nitsch R.M. Qiu W.Q. Citron M. Wurtman R.J. Growdon J.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22959-22962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of ADAM10 prevents amyloid pathology, whereas expression of a dominant negative variant enhances Aβ deposition in a transgenic mouse model (15Postina R. Schroeder A. Dewachter I.

Thus ADAM10 is not only a major sheddase involved in signaling cascades but also an important therapeutic target in Alzheimer disease. In previous work we have shown that β-secretase and βAPP are differentially sorted in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Whereas β-secretase is targeted to the apical domain (16Capell A. Meyn L. Fluhrer R. Teplow D.B. Walter J. Haass C. J. Biol.

The C-terminal deletions of ADAM10 were created by the insertion of a stop codon after the indicated position using PCR. The HA tag was introduced by the reverse primers, and point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Cell Culture—MDCK cells (strain II) were maintained as described (16Capell A. Meyn L. Fluhrer R. Teplow D.B. Walter J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5637-5643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Stable transfections of MDCK cells were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cell lines expressing ADAM10 were selected with 400 μgml-1 Hygromycin. Cell lines with moderate expression levels were selected for the study. To obtain polarized monolayers for surface biotinylation, cells were plated and grown to confluence on 24-mm polycarbonate Transwell filter (Corning Costar Corp.). To increase expression levels, cells were treated overnight with 10 mm butyrate. Similar results were obtained with untreated and treated cells. Antibodies—The polyclonal antibody H-6908 (Sigma) was used for recognition of HA-tagged ADAM10 C-terminal deletion variants, whereas the monoclonal antibody HA11 (clone 16B12; Covance) was used for detection of HA-tagged ADAM10 WT and amino acid exchange variants. The polyclonal antibody directed to the C terminus of ADAM10 was purchased from Calbiochem. The monoclonal antibodies against β-catenin (clone 14) and the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin (C20820) were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. The anti-ZO-1 (rat monoclonal) was obtained from the Hybridoma Bank. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Imaging—MDCK cells grown on filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2 (PBS+). For ADAM10 staining, cells were fixed in methanol (-20 °C) for 5 min at -20 °C. After extensive washing in PBS+ and blocking with 0.2% bovine serum albumin/PBS+, cells were incubated with the indicated first antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C and then, after additional washing, with the fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa 488, Alexa 555; Invitrogen). After extensive washing, filters were cut out and mounted in Mowiol. Confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope. Surface Biotinylation—Surface biotinylation was performed as described (16Capell A. Meyn L. Fluhrer R. Teplow D.B. Walter J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5637-5643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 1% SDS containing lysis buffer and diluted to 0.1% SDS before precipitation with streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitated, biotinylated proteins were separated on SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For detection the indicated HA antibody was used. Specifically bound antibodies were visualized by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Biosciences). For quantification the chemiluminescence signals of three independent experiments were measured with a CD camera-based imaging system (Alpha Innotech). Wound Healing Assay—Untransfected MDCK cells or cells stably transfected with ADAM10 WT or ADAM10 ΔC were seeded in six-well plates (Sarstedt) and cultured until cells just reached confluence (48 h). Three linear wounds were scratched in each dish of cells with a pipette tip (p200; Sarstedt). To avoid proliferation, cells were treated with 100 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell motility was monitored at 6-h intervals by using an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Zeiss). The width of each wound was measured at three positions for the indicated time points. To investigate the localization of endogenous ADAM10 we used a polarized cell line with distinct cell-cell contacts. MDCK cells form an epithelial-like monolayer when grown on a filter support. Apical and basolateral membrane domains are separated by tight junctions that are located close to the apical surface area of the cells. By immunofluorescence endogenous ADAM10 can be detected at the basolateral plasma membrane, primarily at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 1). Costaining for junction marker proteins revealed that ADAM10 predominantly localizes at adherens junctions (Fig. 1). Double stainings in cross-sections of confocal images show an overlap of ADAM10 with β-catenin but almost none with the tight junction marker ZO-1 (Fig. 1). Next the domain required for basolateral targeting of ADAM10 was determined. Because basolateral sorting motifs are generally located within the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins, an ADAM10 cDNA construct missing the cytoplasmic domain was generated (Fig. 2A, ADAM10 ΔC). ADAM10 wild type (WT) and ADAM10 ΔC were stably expressed in MDCK cells, and single cell clones were analyzed. Surface biotinylation of polarized MDCK cells revealed a predominant basolateral distribution of ADAM10 WT, whereas ADAM10 ΔC was missorted to the apical surface (Fig. 2B). Basolateral sorting of ADAM10 WT and apical missorting of ADAM10 ΔC were confirmed by immunofluorescence. Consistent with apical missorting of ADAM10 ΔC, almost no colocalization with β-catenin was detected (Fig. 2C). To identify the basolateral sorting signal, the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM10 was sequentially truncated (Fig. 3A). The deletion constructs of ADAM10 (Δ13, Δ24, Δ28, Δ33, Δ37) were stably transfected in MDCK cells, and surface biotinylation experiments were performed with single cell clones. Up to 28 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail can be removed without affecting basolateral sorting (Fig. 3B). However, removal of five additional amino acids results in apical missorting of ADAM10 Δ33 (Fig. 3B). Thus, correct sorting of ADAM10 requires at least some amino acids within the LPGTL domain. We first investigated a putative function of the LPGTL sequence in basolateral sorting. Single amino acids of the LPGTL sequence were exchanged to alanine (Fig. 3C). The resulting constructs ADAM10-APGTL, -LAGTL, -LPATL, -LPGAL, and -LPGTA were stably transfected into MDCK cells, and the expressed ADAM10 variants were analyzed for their cell surface distribution. Strikingly, the exchange of the first two amino acids of the analyzed stretch led to missorting of ADAM10 (Fig. 3D), whereas the exchange of other amino acids further C-terminal did not affect sorting of ADAM10 (Fig. 3D, ADAM10-LPGTA data not shown). Therefore, the LP motif is essential for basolateral sorting of ADAM10. This may suggest a di-hydrophobic amino acid sequence motif required for basolateral sorting as described previously for other proteins (21Sheikh H. Isacke C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12185-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, a potential Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding domain is adjacent N-terminal to the amino acid stretch analyzed (residues 708-715) (Fig. 4A). SH3-binding domains are defined by a proline core PXXP motif, accompanied by additional prolines or other hydrophobic residues (23Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the influence of the putative SH3-binding domain on polarized sorting of ADAM10. Single proline residues at the N terminus (P708A), within the center (P712A), and the C terminus (P715A) of the predicted SH3 binding region were exchanged to alanine as indicated in Fig. 4A. In addition, a double mutant (P708/712A) was investigated (Fig. 4A). Surface biotinylation experiments revealed that Pro708 and Pro715 are required for the basolateral sorting of ADAM10, but not Pro712 (Fig. 4B). ADAM10 containing the double substitution of P708/712A is apically missorted to the similar extent as the variant containing the single proline exchange at position 708 (Fig. 4B). Because the first and the last residue of the potential SH3-binding domain is required for basolateral transport of ADAM10, our data suggest a critical function of the SH3-binding domain in basolateral transport of ADAM10.FIGURE 4A putative SH3-binding domain located in the juxtamembrane region is required for basolateral sorting of ADAM10.

Wound healing in epithelia requires coordinated cell migration and proliferation regulated by signaling mechanisms that are poorly understood. Recently it has been shown that ADAM10 regulates cell-cell adhesion and migration in a human keratinocyte cell line (18Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the ADAM10 cytoplasmic domain for cell migration, we applied a classical wound healing assay. For this assay non-transfected MDCK cells and MDCK cells stably expressing ADAM10 WT or ADAM10 ΔC were used. Linear wounds were scratched in confluent monolayers, and wound closing was measured after 6 and 12 h (Fig. 5, A and B). Representative photographs of wound closure were taken (Fig. 5A), and the widths of the open wounds were measured (Fig. 5B). Expression of ADAM10 WT accelerated wound healing (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, the apically missorted variant ADAM10 ΔC did not affect wound healing (Fig. 5, A and B). Because it has been shown that ADAM10 is involved in E-cadherin processing (18Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) and E-cadherin is localized at cell-cell junctions, we next analyzed the effect of the ADAM10 ΔC sorting mutant on E-cadherin processing. Stable overexpression of ADAM10 WT enhances processing of E-cadherin as measured by the increased C-terminal E-cadherin fragments in cell lysates (Fig. 5C), whereas the expression of ADAM10 ΔC does not influence E-cadherin processing (Fig. 5C). Thus, these data support a central role of sorting of ADAM10 for its function in substrate processing and cell migration. We have shown that ADAM10 is basolaterally sorted in polarized epithelial cells. Further, we identified within the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM10 certain proline residues of a putative SH3-binding domain (residues 708-715) that are essential for basolateral sorting. In addition, adjacent leucine and proline residues are critically required for the basolateral transport. ADAM10, like many members of the ADAM family, contains two putative SH3-binding domains (Fig. 4A). Sequential deletion of the cytoplasmic domain revealed that the more C-terminal located SH3-binding domain did not influence the basolateral localization of ADAM10. Site-directed mutation identified that proline residues within the juxtamembrane SH3-binding domain affected basolateral expression of ADAM10. The first (Pro708) and the last (Pro715) prolines of the SH3-binding domain are critically required for correct sorting of ADAM10, whereas Pro712 is not. Proline-rich SH3 binding motifs contain a PXXP core and a positively charged amino acid. The positively charged amino acid could be located at either side of the PXXP core and determines the orientation of the ligand toward the SH3 protein (23Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The two possible orientations of ligands are classified as class I (N terminus to C terminus) and class II (C terminus to N terminus) SH3-binding domains. In the case of the juxtamembrane SH3-binding domain of ADAM10 a lysine is located at the N terminus (Lys709) and the C terminus (Lys714) of the SH3-binding domain (Fig. 4A). Thus, the orientation cannot be predicted. The critical proline residues of the PXXP core are often accompanied by other hydrophobic amino acids (23Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). In the case of the ADAM10 SH3-binding domain, these are additional proline and leucine residues. The exchange of these residues to alanine would probably not affect the binding capacity. This could explain why the exchange of P712A did not significantly affect the basolateral sorting of ADAM10. Interestingly, a proline-rich PXXP motif has been identified for basolateral sorting of the epidermal growth factor receptor (24He C. Hobert M. Friend L. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38284-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the corresponding SH3-like protein and the sorting mechanism are not identified yet (24He C. Hobert M. Friend L. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38284-38293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to the predicted SH3-binding domain, the adjacent Leu716 and Pro717 are required for the basolateral sorting of ADAM10. That these two amino acids act as a discrete sorting signal is unlikely, because this motif differs from previously described di-hydrophobic motifs that lack critical proline residues (21Sheikh H. Isacke C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12185-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Moreover, missorting of ADAM10 is not significantly increased by deletions beyond the LP residues. Because no additive effect of apical sorting by deletion of the SH3-binding domain and the LP residues is observed, the latter is likely to contribute to the structure of the SH3-binding domain. Taken together, the putative extended SH3-binding domain represents a novel sorting motif that is critically important for ADAM10 function at adherens junctions. Our findings are consistent with a role of ADAM10 in cell migration (18Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). ADAM10-induced cell migration might be mediated by enhanced E-cadherin shedding (18Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) as well as by shedding of other ADAM10 substrates that are also important for cell migration, such as CD44 or ephrins (19Nagano O.

Blobel C.P. Himanen J.P. Lackmann M. Nikolov D.B. Cell. 2005; 123: 291-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Strikingly, expression of ADAM10 ΔC (as well as the ADAM10-LAGTL mutation; data not shown) failed to increase cell migration. In addition, we observed increased E-cadherin shedding only upon overexpression of ADAM10 WT but not upon expression of an ADAM10 sorting mutant. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the motif is required for targeting of ADAM10 to adherens junctions and for the interaction with at least one of its substrates. For several ADAMs a role in modulation of cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix interaction has been suggested (2Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 27White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the recent finding that ADAM10 is able to cleave substrates located on the membrane of opposing cells (26Janes P.W. Saha N. Barton W.A. Kolev M.V. Wimmer-Kleikamp S.H. Nievergall E. Blobel C.P. Himanen J.P. Lackmann M. Nikolov D.B. Cell. 2005; 123: 291-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, we find that ADAM10 colocalizes with its basolaterally sorted substrates βAPP, CD44, and E-cadherin (17Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L. Gottardi C.J. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Teasdale R.D. J. Biol.

ADAM10 colocalizes predominantly with proteins associated with adherens junctions but only poorly with the tight junction marker ZO-1. ADAMs participate in signaling pathways through specific ectodomain shedding. In particular, ADAM10 cleaves Notch (28Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lubke T. Lena Illert A. von Figura K. Saftig P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), N-cadherin (29Reiss K. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Tousseyn T. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and the Eph receptor (30Hattori M. Osterfield M. Flanagan J.G. Science. 2000; 289: 1360-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), which are all known to undergo subsequent intramembrane proteolysis followed by nuclear signaling. Furthermore, βAPP, CD44, and E-cadherin all undergo intramembrane proteolysis as well (6Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, sorting and transport of ADAM10 to adherens junctions may be required to initiate signaling pathways dependent on cell-cell contacts. This may also have consequences for Alzheimer disease therapy. Therapeutic strategies aiming to increase α-secretase activity should take enhanced cell migration and reduced cell-cell contacts into consideration. To circumvent problems with cell adhesion one may selectively enhance APP shedding on the plasma membrane without affecting substrates located at adherens junctions. We thank S. Lammich, S. Mitterreiter, S. Lichtenthaler, and P. Kahle for helpful suggestions, R. Schrüfer for initial experiments, and F. Fahrenholz for the bovine ADAM10 cDNA.

A variety of feedback-control systems have been described in animals and fungi that allow cells to monitor and adjust membrane constituents to their proper stoichiometry. For example, the sterol regulatory-element-binding protein-Scap pathway, which senses sterol levels in the ER, regulates the transcription of genes required for sterol biosynthesis (reviewed in Ref. 6Goldstein J.L.

Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), which is localized to the ER through its association with the conserved vesicle-associated-membrane protein-associated protein, Scs2p (15Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and PA (12Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Upon addition of inositol, Opi1p rapidly dissociates from the ER, translocates to the nucleus, and represses the expression of the structural genes required for phospholipid biosynthesis (12Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 16Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The regulated expression of these structural genes requires both Ino2p and Ino4p, which bind as a heterodimer to the UASINO element present in the promoters of Opi1p target genes (17Ambroziak J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15344-15349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Opi1p appears to mediate the repression of UASINO-containing genes through a direct interaction with Ino2p (18Heyken W.T. Repenning A. Kumme J. Schuller H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 696-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Gardenour K.R. Levy J. Lopes J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that the transcription of INO1, the most highly regulated of the Ino2p-Ino4p target genes (16Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), is rapidly repressed by Opi1p when inositol is added to the growth medium (12Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the present study, we profiled the temporal changes in global gene expression after the addition of inositol to the growth medium of dividing yeast cells. The goal of this experiment was to identify both the sequence and timing of every gene whose expression level responds to the rapid and profound changes in phospholipid metabolism that are induced by inositol supplementation (13Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. June 15, 2006; 10.1074/jbc.M603548200PubMed Google Scholar). By comparing the identified patterns of gene expression with the measured ongoing and induced changes in phospholipid metabolism under identical growth conditions in a parallel study (13Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. June 15, 2006; 10.1074/jbc.M603548200PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that we would identify metabolic signaling networks, originating at the site of membrane synthesis, that coordinate phospholipid metabolism with gene expression. Our findings indicate that multiple distinct signals, produced by the rapid changes in phospholipid metabolism induced by inositol supplementation, emanate from the ER and directly control the expression of genes representing at least six distinct transcriptional profiles. These include phospholipid biosynthetic genes regulated by Opi1p, ER luminal protein folding chaperone and oxidoreductase genes regulated by the UPR pathway, and lipid-remodeling genes regulated by Mga2p, an ER-localized transcription factor that is activated by proteolytic cleavage from the membrane. Within a similar time frame following the exposure to inositol, numerous genes involved in ribosome biogenesis are transiently up-regulated. Simultaneously, cytosolic stress response genes are down-regulated, suggesting that growth in the absence of inositol is a stress condition that is alleviated by the addition of inositol. We also report that the UPR pathway is rapidly inactivated by inositol supplementation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the UPR pathway response to inositol is separable from the response mediated by Opi1p. Overall, these results indicate that altering membrane lipid composition has acute effects on global gene expression networks and suggest that the interplay among distinct ER membrane-localized signaling pathways contributes to this response. Strains and Plasmids—The wild-type strain BY4742 (MATα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0) derived from S288C (20Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar) was used in all microarray experiments. The isogenic hac1Δ strain (MATα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, hac1Δ::KanMx) was purchased from Research Genetics (now Invitrogen). Individual strains containing single disruptions in ELO1, MGA2, NTE1, SPT23, PLB2, TIP1, or YOR175C, in which the entire targeted ORF was replaced with the HIS3 marker, were constructed by PCR-mediated gene replacement using the pFA6a-His3MX6 template (kind gift of M. Longtine) as described previously (21Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (3877) Google Scholar) in the wild-type strain BY4742. All strains were maintained on YPD plates (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar). The hac1Δ strain was transformed with the centromeric YCp-HAC1Δintron plasmid (pHAC1i, kind gift of K. Mori) and maintained on leucine dropout medium. The wild-type and isogenic mga2Δ strains were transformed with the pAM6 plasmid (kind gift of C. Martin), containing a tandem repeat LORE-CYC1-lacZ fusion (22Vasconcelles M.J. Jiang Y. McDaid K. Gilooly L. Wretzel S. Porter D.L. Martin C.E. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14374-14384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and maintained on uracil dropout medium. The mga2Δ strain was also co-transformed with the pAM6 plasmid and pAM31 centromeric plasmid (kind gift of C. Martin), containing MGA2 lacking codons for the C-terminal 172 amino acids (23Jiang Y. Vasconcelles M.J. Wretzel S. Light A. Gilooly L. McDaid K. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Goldberg M.A. Eukaryot Cell. 2002; 1: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and maintained on uracil and leucine double dropout medium. Cell Growth—Cells were grown in chemically defined synthetic growth media for at least twelve generations without inositol containing 1 mm choline-Cl at 30 °C to mid-logarithmic growth phase exactly as previously described (16Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). myo-Inositol was then added to the growing culture at a final concentration of 75 μm. Samples were harvested by filtration immediately prior to the addition of inositol and at 5-, 15-, 30-, 60-, and 120-min intervals following the addition of inositol. Harvested cells were flash frozen and stored at -80 °C. RNA Isolation and Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was obtained from cells by the high temperature acid phenol method, and mRNA was isolated using oligo(dT) cellulose as previously described (16Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). mRNA from cells collected immediately prior to the addition of inositol was used as a common reference. Cy5- and Cy3-labeled cDNA probes were synthesized from mRNA collected at each time point, combined with fluorescently labeled cDNA probes from the reference sample, and hybridized to Corning CMT Yeast-S288c Gene Arrays (version 1.32, Corning, Inc.) containing 6,135 unique Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORFs as described previously (16Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hybridized microarray slides were simultaneously scanned with lasers at 532- and 635-nm bandwidths using a GenePix 4000B array scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate. Statistical Analysis—To ensure that dye-specific biases were not introduced, a dye-swap design was performed for each time point/reference pair. Image analysis for each array was processed using the GenePix Pro 4.0 (Axon Instruments, Inc.) software package, which produces fluorescence intensity pairs (R and G) for each gene. After image acquisition, individual data spots on each microarray were visually inspected for size, signal-to-noise ratio, background level, and uniformity. Using these quality control criteria, ∼14% of the spots for each quadruplicate set of experiments were discarded because of poor spot quality, a conventional practice for microarray data analysis (24Wang X. Hessner M.J. Wu Y. Pati N. Ghosh S. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As a result, we obtained 5991 unique ORFs for our subsequent analysis. Normalization for each slide was conducted as follows: let M = log2(R/G), and A = 0.5log2(RG). The log ratio M is dependent upon the overall spot intensity A (25Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This intensity-dependent trend for each replicate was fitted using the PROC LOESS function (26Dudoit S. Yang Y.H. Callow M.J. Speed T.P. Statistica Sinica. 2002; 12: 111-139Google Scholar) in SAS. Next, the log ratio values (M) were normalized by subtracting the trend values. For each ORF, in which at least three high quality replicates were available at each time point, a Student t test was performed on normalized M using the null hypothesis of no change in expression (i.e. normalization to M = 0). The t statistic was computed for each ORF at each time point, and 1455 ORFs were selected with a p value of ≤0.025 for at least one of the five time points. From this set of ORFs, 712 unique genes were selected whose absolute normalized M values exhibited ≥0.5-fold change in at least a single time point. For these genes, a B-spline projection was performed followed by principle component analysis for the projected values, which captures the variance in a dataset (27Yeung K.Y. Ruzzo W.L. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 763-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The principle components were then subjected to hierarchical clustering, a technique for finding gene clusters based on co-expression (28Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (12766) Google Scholar), and 28 clusters were formed. When used sequentially, principle component analysis and hierarchical clustering are a powerful statistical method for identifying regulated patterns in microarray time-course data (29Zhao X. Marron J.S. Wells M.T. Statistica Sinica. 2004; 14: 789-808Google Scholar). Because a common reference sample was used, the absolute abundance for eight representative mRNAs (ACT1, ELO1, FAA4, HAC1, INO1, KAR2, OLE1, and TCM1) over the time course was verified by quantitative Northern blot analysis. These data obtained by Northern blotting agreed with the ratios obtained by the microarray analysis; therefore, changes in the ratios measured by microarray analysis should reliably reflect actual changes in mRNA levels at each time point. Enrichment for specific transcription factor gene associations in our dataset was determined utilizing the yeast genome-wide location analysis dataset of Harbison et al. (30Harbison C.T. Gordon D.B. Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Macisaac K.D. Danford T.W. Hannett N.M. Tagne J.B. Reynolds D.B. Yoo J. Jennings E.G. Zeitlinger J. Pokholok D.K. Kellis M. Rolfe P.A. Takusagawa K.T. Lander E.S. Gifford D.K. Fraenkel E. Young R.A. Nature. 2004; 431: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). The number of promoter regions in the 712 significantly regulated genes that contained a bound transcription factor (X), using a p value threshold of 0.005, was counted. This number was compared with the total gene occupancy across the genome for the same transcription factor (Y). Any specific transcription factor with a ratio X/Y > 1 was considered to be enriched. From this analysis, 58 transcription factors out of a total of 203 yeast transcription factors for which the genomic occupancy was determined (30Harbison C.T. Gordon D.B. Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Macisaac K.D. Danford T.W. Hannett N.M. Tagne J.B. Reynolds D.B. Yoo J. Jennings E.G. Zeitlinger J. Pokholok D.K. Kellis M. Rolfe P.A. Takusagawa K.T. Lander E.S. Gifford D.K. Fraenkel E. Young R.A. Nature. 2004; 431: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar) were enriched in our dataset. Gene ontology term associations for the yeast genome were obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (www.yeastgenome.org) in August, 2005. The list of UPR pathway target genes was obtained from Travers et al. (31Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter analysis was performed using RSA TOOLS (rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/) (32van Helden J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3593-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) using the LORE consensus WCYCAACAA (22Vasconcelles M.J. Jiang Y. McDaid K. Gilooly L. Wretzel S. Porter D.L.

Northern Blot Analysis—2 μg of total RNA or 250 ng of mRNA was fractionated on 1.1% glyoxal agarose gels and transferred to Nytran SuPerCharge nylon membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) using a turboblotter (Schleicher and Schuell) as described (33Burnett W.V. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Strand-specific 32P-labled riboprobes were synthesized from linearized plasmids pJH310-INO1 (34Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol.

Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed by analysis on a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with ImageQuaNT software. pSJ34-OLE1 was constructed by PCR-amplifying the OLE1 ORF and inserting the 798-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment into pGEM1. pSJ35-ACT1 was constructed by PCR-amplifying the ACT1 ORF and inserting the 321-bp BglII fragment into pGEM1. pSJ36-FAA4 was constructed by PCR-amplifying the FAA4 ORF and inserting the 837-bp EcoR1 fragment into pGEM1. pSJ37-lacZ was constructed by PCR-amplifying the Escherichia coli lacZ ORF from pAM6 and inserting the 723-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment into pGEM1. pSJ38-ELO1 was constructed by PCR-amplifying the ELO1 ORF and inserting the 585-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment into pGEM1. Previously, we reported the steady-state genome-wide expression profiles of wild-type yeast cells grown for approximately twelve generations in various combinations of the phospholipid precursors inositol and choline (16Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This earlier study provided a static snapshot of the global differences from gene expression in cells grown under conditions that are known to alter phospholipid metabolism (11Kelley M.J. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18078-18085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P.

June 15, 2006; 10.1074/jbc.M603548200PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the individual effects of inositol and choline on gene expression are distinct but that the combined effects of inositol and choline significantly increase the number of genes that respond to either inositol or choline alone. From this study we concluded that inositol plays the major role in mediating target gene expression due to its dramatic effects on phospholipid metabolism and that choline exaggerates this effect (13Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. June 15, 2006; 10.1074/jbc.M603548200PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a recent study from our laboratory (13Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. June 15, 2006; 10.1074/jbc.M603548200PubMed Google Scholar), we reported that the addition of inositol to cells grown in media lacking inositol, but containing choline, leads to a rapid and dramatic reprogramming of cellular lipid synthesis and turnover within a 30- to 60-min time frame. In the present study, we utilized microarray analysis to profile both the timing and ordering of genome-wide transcriptional changes following the addition of inositol in wild-type yeast cells. The time course and growth conditions were chosen to examine both the immediate and long term changes in gene expression and to allow a direct comparison to the metabolic profile of the changes in lipid metabolism induced by inositol addition (13Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. June 15, 2006; 10.1074/jbc.M603548200PubMed Google Scholar). The complete dataset is available in Supplemental Data. Overview of Gene Expression Profiles following Inositol Supplementation—We selected ORFs for analysis that showed a p value ≤ 0.025 over four replicates following normalization of our microarray data (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Using these criteria, we detected 712 genes that showed ≥0.5-fold change in expression in at least one time point over the course of the experiment. As we observed for specific phospholipids in our metabolic profiling experiments (12Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 13Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. June 15, 2006; 10.1074/jbc.M603548200PubMed Google Scholar), the transcriptional response to the addition of inositol was extremely rapid, with most genes showing a change in expression at early time points. Both transient and sustained changes in the patterns of gene expression were observed, revealing a dynamic transcriptional response following the addition of inositol (Fig. 1). To identify regulated patterns of expression from our kinetic genome-wide analysis, each significantly regulated gene was grouped into 1 of 28 clusters showing a similar pattern of expression using the method of principle component analysis (27Yeung K.Y. Ruzzo W.L. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 763-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by hierarchical clustering (28Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (12766) Google Scholar). Next, each cluster was examined for evidence of co-regulation using the four criteria described below. First, we utilized the comprehensive data set from the genome-wide location analysis study conducted by Harbison et al. (30Harbison C.T. Gordon D.B. Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Macisaac K.D. Danford T.W. Hannett N.M. Tagne J.B. Reynolds D.B. Yoo J. Jennings E.G. Zeitlinger J. Pokholok D.K. Kellis M. Rolfe P.A. Takusagawa K.T. Lander E.S. Gifford D.K. Fraenkel E. Young R.A. Nature. 2004; 431: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar), which identified the genomic binding sites for 203 transcriptional regulators. We compared their data set (30Harbison C.T. Gordon D.B. Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Macisaac K.D. Danford T.W. Hannett N.M. Tagne J.B. Reynolds D.B. Yoo J. Jennings E.G. Zeitlinger J. Pokholok D.K. Kellis M. Rolfe P.A. Takusagawa K.T. Lander E.S. Gifford D.K. Fraenkel E. Young R.A. Nature. 2004; 431: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar) with the set of genes that were identified in our present study and focused our analysis only on those transcription factors whose gene associations were significantly enriched in our dataset (see Supplemental Data for the list of enriched transcription factors). As expected, genes bound by Ino2p, Ino4p, and Opi1p were significantly enriched in our data set. Next, we examined for enrichment of gene ontology terms annotated in the Saccharomyces Genome Database within each cluster. Third, given that a set of UPR pathway target genes were detected in our previous microarray study (16Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we inspected our dataset for enrichment of yeast UPR target genes determined by Travers et al.

In the human brain, tau pre-mRNA splicing is regulated to maintain a delicate balance of exon 10-containing and exon 10-skipping isoforms. Splicing mutations affecting tau exon 10 alternative splicing lead to tauopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders including dementia. Molecular mechanisms regulating tau alternative splicing remain to be elucidated. In this study, we have developed an expression cloning strategy to identify splicing factors that stimulate tau exon 10 inclusion. Using this expression cloning approach, we have identified a previously unknown tau exon 10 splicing regulator, RBM4 (RNA binding motif protein 4). In cells transfected with a tau minigene, RBM4 overexpression leads to an increased inclusion of exon 10, whereas RBM4 down-regulation decreases exon 10 inclusion. The activity of RBM4 in stimulating tau exon 10 inclusion is abolished by mutations in its RNA-binding domain. A putative intronic splicing enhancer located in intron 10 of the tau gene is required for the splicing stimulatory activity of RBM4. Immunohistological analyses reveal that RBM4 is expressed in the human brain regions affected in tauopathy, including the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Our study demonstrates that RBM4 is involved in tau exon 10 alternative splicing. Our work also suggests that down-regulating tau exon 10 splicing activators, such as RBM4, may be of therapeutic potential in tauopathies involving excessive tau exon 10 inclusion.

The expression of the tau gene is under complex regulation at multiple steps, including both post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. In the human brain, six tau isoforms are expressed as a result of alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 (10Goedert M. Wischik C.M. Crowther R.A. Walker J.E. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alternative splicing of exon 10 (Ex10), which encodes for one of the four MT-binding domains, gives rise to tau isoforms containing either four MT-binding repeats (Tau4R, Ex10+) or three MT-binding repeats (Tau3R, Ex10-). In the adult human brain, the regulated splicing of exon10 results in a ratio of Tau4R to Tau3R of approximately 1.Genetic studies have revealed a number of mutations in the human tau gene in patients with tauopathy. More than 30 different mutations have been associated with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome-17 (FTDP-17) (13Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S.

This is an autosomal dominant disorder with clinically heterogeneous manifestations that include behavioral, cognitive, and motor abnormalities.

In vitro experiments suggest that Tau4R and Tau3R proteins bind and stabilize MTs in different manners (16Makrides V. Shen T.E. Bhatia R. Smith B.L. Thimm J. Lal R. Feinstein S.C. J. Biol.

Understanding how these alternative splicing events are regulated is an important issue in functional genomics. In the past 2 decades, a number of alternative splicing regulators have been identified. Many of these trans-acting factors were initially identified using biochemical approaches (reviewed in Refs. 21Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar, 22Faustino N.A. Cooper T.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 419-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 23Wu J.Y.Y. L.

In this study, we have developed an expression cloning approach using a tau exon 10 splicing green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter, Tau4R-GFP, in which GFP expression was dependent on the tau exon 10 inclusion. Using this system to screen a human brain cDNA library, we have identified a previously unknown tau exon 10 splicing activator, RBM4, a protein recently shown to play a role in alternative splicing of α-tropomyosin (24Lin J.C. Tarn W.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10111-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our experiments show that overexpression of RBM4 stimulates tau exon 10 inclusion, and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock-down of RBM4 expression in transfected cells reduces tau exon inclusion. Immunohistochemical staining indicates that RBM4 is expressed in the brain regions involved in tauopathy. Our results support a role of RBM4 in regulating tau exon 10 splicing.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Cloning Using the Tau Reporter Gene—We prepared a human adult brain cDNA library using the adult brain mRNA purchased from Clontech. The quality of this cDNA library was tested using reverse transcription-PCR and small scale screening before the library was subdivided into 400 cDNA pools. It was estimated that each pool contained ∼5000 clones. Each of these 400 primary pools was amplified for 6–8 h at 37 °C after being carefully plated on 20 × 20-cm bacterial plates. cDNAs were prepared from each pool using an optimized medium scale plasmid preparation method combining polyethylene glycol precipitation with the endotoxin-free DNA preparation kit (Qiagen) to ensure the high quality of DNA preparations for transfection. The typical transfection efficiency is ∼50–60%, as assessed by GFP expression in the control cells transfected with a GFP plasmid. For the first round of transfection, 40 combined pools (combined from 10 primary pools in a grid fashion to allow easy identification of individual positive primary pools) of cDNAs were transfected in cells stably expressing the Tau GFP reporter gene. Using this grid design, 400 cDNA pools were screened in 40 primary transfections in 15-cm tissue culture dishes and further screened in subsequent rounds of transfections.Because HEK293 cells had a high efficiency of transfection and a low background GFP expression, we chose this cell line for preparing a stable cell line expressing the Tau reporter gene. Stable HEK293 cells expressing Tau4R-GFP reporter were selected with G418 and used for expression of cDNA clones following transfection with pooled cDNAs from the adult brain cDNA library. During the first two rounds of transfection, it appeared more efficient to visually examine individual transfected culture plates under an inverted fluorescent microscope than using a cell sorter. The primary positive pools that gave significant activation of GFP expression were identified, and cDNAs in these pools were further divided. For each primary positive pool, 20 subpools were prepared and individually transfected into stable cells expressing the Tau4R-GFP reporter gene in 10-cm dishes. The positive subpools were again identified using inverted fluorescent microscopy and subdivided for another round of transfection until individual single cDNA clones were isolated. After seven rounds of retransfection, we were able to isolate single cDNA clones that have significant effects on tau exon 10 splicing.Plasmids and Antibodies—Mammalian expression plasmids for HA-tagged wild type or mutant RBM4 (25Lai M.C. Kuo H.W. Chang W.C. Tarn W.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and for raver were described previously (26Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing RNAi for RBM4 was described (24Lin J.C. Tarn W.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10111-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-HA antibody was purchased from Covance. Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-RBM4 was prepared as described previously (25Lai M.C. Kuo H.W. Chang W.C. Tarn W.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Transfections and RT-PCR—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection was carried out using a previously described calcium phosphate precipitation procedure with 1–3 μg of DNA (27Jiang Z.H. Zhang W.J. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). In RNAi experiments, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Splicing products of the expressed tau minigenes were detected using RT-PCR as previously described (27Jiang Z.H. Zhang W.J. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was also performed to detect the endogenous Bcl-xL and γ-actin genes using the corresponding specific primers. The products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 6% polyacrylamide gels.RNA-Protein Interactions—The RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription in the presence of [32P]UTP using T7 RNA polymerase from linearized DNA templates as described (28Jiang Z. Tang H. Havlioglu N. Zhang X. Stamm S. Yan R. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The RNA probes were gel-purified and used for the UV-cross-linking assay. The recombinant RBM4 protein was expressed as a His6-tagged protein and purified from Escherichia coli as described by Lai et al. (25Lai M.C. Kuo H.W. Chang W.C. Tarn W.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For UV cross-linking, ∼20 fmol of RNA probe was incubated at 30 °C with 1 μg of purified RBM4 or 30 μl of cell lysate in a 40-μl reaction mixture under in vitro splicing conditions (28Jiang Z. Tang H. Havlioglu N. Zhang X. Stamm S. Yan R. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The samples were irradiated on ice under 254-nm light for 10 min. The probes were digested in equal volumes of RNase A (5 mg/ml) (Sigma) at 30 °C for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation, following the RNase treatment, samples were incubated with HA.11 anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance) at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A/G-agarose beads were then added with further incubation and gentle rocking. Following washing, the RNA-bound proteins immunoprecipitated were eluted and resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.Immunohistochemical Staining—Human brain samples from autopsy material were fixed in formalin and paraffin-embedded. 6-μm-thick sections from the frontal and hippocampal regions were used for immunohistochemical staining. The Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) staining kit for rabbit polyclonal antibody was used to perform immunostaining with the affinity-purified rabbit anti-RBM4 antibody. Antigen retrieval was carried out in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, pH 9.0. Primary antibody was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Immunostaining was carried out following the instruction manual, color development was performed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstaining was with hematoxylene.RESULTSEstablishing a GFP Reporter-based Strategy for Cloning Trans-acting Splicing Regulators That Stimulate Exon 10 Inclusion—In our previous studies, a human tau minigene has been established that recapitulates tau exon 10 alternative splicing in the human brain (28Jiang Z. Tang H. Havlioglu N. Zhang X. Stamm S. Yan R. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Jiang Z. Cote J. Kwon J.M. Goate A.M. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4036-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this minigene system, alternative inclusion or exclusion of the exon 10 leads to the formation of Tau4R and Tau3R, respectively. To develop a system for identifying splicing activators that enhance tau exon 10 inclusion, we prepared a tau exon 10-splicing GFP reporter (Tau4R-GFP) by fusing the tau minigene with a cDNA fragment encoding GFP (Fig. 1). This Tau4R-GFP reporter gene was constructed by adding a translation start codon upstream of exon 9 so that the tau minigene construct produced a fusion protein containing tau peptide fragment fused to GFP (Fig. 1A). One base pair was inserted by site-directed mutagenesis in exon 10. This Tau4R-GFP reporter contained the GFP gene in frame with the 94-bp exon 10 so that the GFP gene was expressed as a functional protein product only when exon 10 was included (Fig. 2). The Tau4R-GFP reporter gene enabled us to use GFP expression as an indicator for exon 10 inclusion. When the Tau4R-GFP reporter gene was transfected into HeLa or HEK293 cells, the tau minigene underwent splicing in a similar pattern as the wild type tau gene, producing both Tau3R and Tau4R splicing isoforms. No aberrant splicing, such as activation of cryptic splice sites, was detected (data not shown). The Tau4R-GFP reporter showed a low background of GFP expression in HEK293 cells, facilitating the expression cloning screening as described below.FIGURE 2The expression of Tau-GFP reporter during the cDNA library screening. The stable HEK293 cell line expressing the Tau4R-GFP reporter gene was used for screening cDNA library. A progressive subdividing-retransfecting method was used to identify cDNAs encoding potential regulators of tau alternative splicing, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GFP fluorescence was monitored by fluorescent microscopy following the transfection of pools of cDNAs prepared from the cDNA library. A1–A3, phase-contrast images; B1–B3, corresponding fluorescent microscopic images. These experiments show progressive enrichment of GFP-expressing cells following the primary round (B1), the third round (B2), and the sixth round (B3) of subdivision and retransfection of the positive cDNA pools.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identifying Trans-acting Factors Enhancing Tau Exon 10 Inclusion—We have been interested in identifying protein factors important for regulating tau exon 10 alternative splicing. By examining their biochemical function and molecular mechanisms, we wish to understand how these splicing regulators control the balance of different tau splicing isoforms. To search for splicing factors that stimulate tau exon 10 splicing, we made use of the Tau4R-GFP reporter gene cassette (Fig. 1A). We developed a progressive subdivision and screening protocol (Fig. 1B) to screen a human brain cDNA library (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Following seven rounds of resubdivision and retransfection, seven individual cDNA clones that influence tau exon 10 splicing were isolated. Five cDNA clones are still under characterization. Sequencing analyses of the remaining cDNAs and data bank searches showed that two cDNA clones encode an RNA-binding protein known as RNA-binding motif protein 4, RBM4 (25Lai M.C. Kuo H.W. Chang W.C. Tarn W.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). RBM4 protein will be the focus of this report.Confirming the Activity of RBM4 in Regulating Tau Exon 10 Splicing—To validate the screen and rule out potential indirect effects on the GFP reporter, we examined the effect of RBM4 on tau exon 10 splicing using the original tau exon 9-10-11 splicing substrate (29Jiang Z. Cote J. Kwon J.M. Goate A.M. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4036-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Another RNA recognition motif (RRM)-containing splicing factor, Raver (40), was also tested. The tau minigene was co-transfected with either control vector or RBM4 or Raver expression plasmid (Fig. 3). Following transfection, tau exon 10 alternative splicing pattern was examined by RT-PCR using tau minigene-specific primers (Fig. 3A). RBM4 expression was measured both at the RNA level (by specific RT-PCR with actin as the internal control, Fig. 3, B and C) and at protein level (by Western blotting; Fig. 3D). Overexpression of RBM4 led to an increased inclusion of exon 10 (Fig. 3A, lane 2), whereas transfection of Raver (Fig. 3A, lane 3) or control vector transfection (Fig. 3A, lane 1) did not affect exon 10 splicing (Fig. 3A, compare lane 2 with lane 1 or lane 3). These results confirmed that RBM4 stimulates tau exon 10 inclusion, supporting that the effect of RBM4 detected in expression cloning is due to its activity in stimulating tau exon 10 splicing rather than other effects on GFP expression.FIGURE 3Overexpression of RBM4 protein increases the inclusion of tau exon 10 in transfected cells. The corresponding cDNA plasmids expressing either the vector control (lane 1), RBM4 (lane 2), or Raver (lane 3) were co-transfected with Tau minigene tauEx9-10-11 into HEK293 cells.

We examined whether the interaction of RBM4 with RNA was required for its activity in stimulating tau exon 10 splicing. We made use of an RBM4 mutant containing mutations in the conserved aromatic residues of the RRM domain of RBM4, RBM4-mRRM. This mutant is deficient in RNA binding (25Lai M.C. Kuo H.W. Chang W.C. Tarn W.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression plasmids encoding wild type or mutant (RBM4-mRRM) proteins containing a hemagglutinin (HA) tag were co-transfected into HEK293 cells together with the tau minigene. Tau exon 10 alternative splicing was then measured using RT-PCR. Although the wild-type and mutant RBM4 proteins were expressed at a similar level (Fig. 4, B and D), the stimulation of tau exon 10 splicing was observed only in cells transfected with the wild-type and not mutant RBM4 (Fig. 4A). The quantification of tau splicing isoforms in these co-transfection-coupled RT-PCR experiments indicated that the ratio of exon 10-including to exon 10-skipping tau isoforms (Ex10+/Ex10–) was significantly increased in cells transfected with the wild-type RBM4 as compared with those of the vector control or cells expressing the RRM mutant RBM4 (p < 0.001). On the other hand, overexpression of the RRM mutant RBM4 protein did not affect tau exon 10 splicing, similar to the vector control (Fig. 4E). These experiments demonstrate that the RNA recognition domain of RBM4 is required for its stimulation of exon 10 inclusion, suggesting that RBM4 may regulate tau exon 10 splicing by interacting with tau pre-mRNA.FIGURE 4The RNA recognition domain of RBM4 is essential for its activation of tau exon 10 inclusion.

A UV-cross-linking-coupled immunoprecipitation assay was performed using 32P-labeled tau pre-mRNA and protein extracts prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with HA-tagged RBM4 (HA-RBM4) or the vector control. Following UV cross-linking, immunoprecipitation was carried out using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody, and immunoprecipitation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. A 40-kDa band was detected in the reactions containing HA-RBM4 (Fig. 5A, lane 2) but not in the vector control (Fig. 5A, lane 1), indicating that RBM4 interacts with tau pre-mRNA. To map the site of RBM4 interaction, different regions of tau pre-mRNA were tested. UV-cross-linking experiments using RNA fragments corresponding to different regions of tau pre-mRNA suggest that RBM4 interacts with an intronic region downstream of exon 10 in the tau pre-mRNA (Fig. 5, B and C). In the presence of control RNA, no cross-linking signal was detected with RBM4 (Fig. 5B, lane 1). Specific UV-cross-linking signal was detected when HA-RBM4 protein extract was incubated with tau pre-mRNA transcript containing the exon 10 with the 5′ end of intron 10, and the removal of exon 11 together with the 3′ end of intron 10 did not affect RBM4 binding (Fig. 5B, lane 2). The removal of exon 10 did not affect the UV cross-linking, suggesting that the intronic sequence immediately downstream of the 5′ splice site of exon 10 contained an RBM4 binding site (Fig. 5C). The UV-cross-linking signal was detected when a 260-nucleotide intronic fragment located 100 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ splice site of exon 10 was incubated with the wild-type HA-RBM4 protein extract b"

In the present study, we identified a Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP), TCGAP (Tc10/Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein), as a novel Fyn substrate. TCGAP interacted with Fyn and was phosphorylated by Fyn, with Tyr-406 in the GAP domain as a major Fyn-mediated phosphorylation site. Fyn suppressed the GAP activity of wild-type TCGAP but not the Y406F mutant of TCGAP in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, suggesting that Fyn-mediated Tyr-406 phosphorylation negatively regulated the TCGAP activity. In situ hybridization analyses showed that TCGAP mRNA was expressed prominently in both immature and adult mouse brain, with high levels in cortex, corpus striatum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Overexpression of wild-type TCGAP in PC12 cells suppressed nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth, whereas a GAP-defective mutant of TCGAP enhanced the neurite outgrowth. Nerve growth factor enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of TCGAP through activation of Src family kinases. These results suggest that TCGAP is involved in Fyn-mediated regulation of axon and dendrite outgrowth.

These results suggest that TCGAP is involved in Fyn-mediated regulation of axon and dendrite outgrowth. Fyn, a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, plays important roles in brain development and mature brain functions. Fyn-knock-out mice have various neural defects, including defective long term potentiation, impaired spatial memory, hypomyelination, abnormal dendrite orientation, uncoordinated hippocampal structure, increased fearfulness, and increased ethanol sensitivity (1Grant S.G.

These multiple effects of Fyn deficiency in the brain indicate that Fyn is involved in several neural signaling pathways. Recent studies have identified several Fyn-binding proteins and substrates in the brain that include CNR, mDab1, N-WASP, PSD-95, p190RhoGAP, and NR2B. These molecules are important for neural migration, synaptic plasticity, oligodendrocyte differentiation, and axon growth and guidance (7Senzaki H. Ogawa M. Yagi T.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which Fyn regulates these processes remain elusive. The Rho family of small GTPases (Rho GTPases), such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, play important roles in cytoskeletal remodeling as well as membrane trafficking, transcriptional regulation, and cell growth (14Tapon N.

Rac1 regulates formation of membrane lamellae, and Cdc42 triggers outgrowth of peripheral spike-like protrusions called filopodia (16Ridley A.J. Hall A.

In the central nervous system, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for the migration of neuron, axon guidance, development of dendrites, and morphological differentiation of oligodendrocytes that are involved in brain development (20Luo L.

TCGAP (Tc10/Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein) is a recently identified RhoGAP, and it plays an important role in the regulation of insulin-induced glucose transport in adipocytes (33Chiang S.-H. Hwang J. Legendre M. Zhang M. Kimura A. Saltiel A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2679-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In response to insulin, TCGAP translocates to the plasma membrane in adipocytes. TCGAP contains an N-terminal Phox homology domain, Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, RhoGAP domain, and several proline-rich sequences at the C-terminal region. TCGAP specifically interacts via its GAP domain with Cdc42 and TC10β. The role of TCGAP in the brain has not been studied, although TCGAP is expressed at high levels in brain and testis (33Chiang S.-H. Hwang J. Legendre M. Zhang M. Kimura A. Saltiel A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2679-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the TCGAP is a novel Fyn substrate in vivo. GAP activity of TCGAP was suppressed by Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of the protein. Expression of wild-type TCGAP in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells suppressed NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, whereas a GAP-defective mutant of TCGAP enhanced the neurite outgrowth. NGF enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of TCGAP through activation of Src family kinases in PC12 cells. All these data suggest that TCGAP is involved in Fyn-mediated regulation of axon and dendrite outgrowth. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A cDNA encoding the full-length of human brain-type Fyn was cloned in-frame into pGBT9 vector (Clontech) as a bait plasmid. The reporter yeast strain YJ69-2A harboring the bait plasmid was transformed with a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech). Transformants were selected on synthetic media lacking leucine, tryptophan, adenine, and histidine. DNA sequences of the insert in the selected transformants were analyzed by searching the BLAST data base. DNA Constructs—A cDNA clone for human TCGAP cDNA (GenBank™ AK096338) was a kind gift from S. Sugano (University of Tokyo, Japan) and Helix Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). A GAP-inactive mutant (Arg-350 to Ile-350, R350I) and a YF mutant (Tyr-406 to Phe-406, Y406F) of TCGAP were generated by PCR. The expression plasmids for TCGAP were constructed in the pME18S vector (34Takeuchi M. Kuramochi S. Fusaki N. Nada S. Kawamura-Tsuzuku J. Matsuda S. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Okada M. Yamamoto T. J.

The expression plasmids pME-FynR176K (an SH2-defective mutant) and pME-FynP134L (an SH3-defective mutant) were generated by the methods of Kunkel (35Richard S. Yu D. Blumer K.J. Hausladen D.

The expression plasmids pEFBOS-Myc-RhoA, pEFBOS-Myc-Cdc42, and pEFBOS-Myc-Rac1 were kindly provided by Y. Takai (University of Osaka, Japan). The plasmid for GST-Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain of Pak (GST-CRIB) was kindly provided by C. Sasakawa (University of Tokyo, Japan). The plasmid for GST-Rho binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-RBD) was described previously (36Nakazawa T. Watabe A.M. Tezuka T. Yoshida Y. Yokoyama K. Umemori H. Inoue A. Okabe S. Manabe T. Yamamoto T.

Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Retroviral Infection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and Plat-E cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs by the standard calcium phosphate method. Retroviral infection of PC12 cells was performed as described (37Brodie C. Bogi K. Acs P. Lazarovici P. Petrovics G. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kawa S. Fujimoto J. Tezuka T. Nakazawa T. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PP2 and PP3 (Calbiochem) were added to the final concentration of 10 μm to the medium. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against TCGAP were raised by immunizing rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein fused with a portion of human TCGAP (antibody N: amino acid residues 1–159, antibody M: 760–926, and antibody C: 947–1126) or keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated with a peptide, LHSEGQTRSYC, that corresponds to amino acid residues 1116–1126 of human TCGAP (antibody P). The antibodies were affinity-purified by antigen-coupled columns. Anti-Fyn mAb was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Myc mAb (9E10) and anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr) mAb (4G10) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Preparation of Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Lysates of transfected cells and brain were prepared using TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm Na3VO4 with aprotinin at 50 units/ml). For immunoprecipitation, precleared lysates were incubated sequentially with the appropriate antibodies and Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with TNE buffer. Immunoprecipitates and lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then blocked with TBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin and blotted with primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and Renaissance Plus reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or CDP-Star (TROPIX) were used to visualize the immunoreactive proteins. In Situ Hybridization—A partial mouse cDNA fragment (corresponding to nucleotides 2363–2560 in human TCGAP cDNA) was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene). After verification of the sequence, the cRNA for mouse TCGAP was prepared by in vitro transcription, labeled with [35S]UTP, and used as a probe. Mouse embryo sections at embryonic days 11 (E11), E12, E13, E14, E15, and E16 were purchased from Novagen. Mice at E18 and postnatal 1–4 week of age were prepared as described (36Nakazawa T.

Fresh frozen brain sections (10 μm) in the coronal, parasagittal, and sagittal plane, were mounted on glass slides (Matsunami). Sections were treated at room temperature as follows: fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min, washing with PBS for 5 min twice, acetylation with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine (Tris)–HCl (pH 8.0), for 10 min, washing with PBS for 5 min twice, 70% ethanol for 5 min, 90% ethanol for 3 min, 100% ethanol for 3 min, chloroform for 10 min, 100% ethanol for 3 min, and then drying at room temperature for 1 h. Hybridization was performed at 55 °C for 10 h in a hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 17.3 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% dextran sulfate, supplemented with 1.2 × 106 cpm of 35S-labeled oligonucleotide and 40 μg of yeast tRNA. Slides were washed as follows: washing at 55 °C for 20 min in 5× SSC containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, washed at 65 °C for 30 min in 2× SSC containing 50% formamide and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, treated with 20 μg/ml RNase in RNase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m NaCl), washed at room temperature for 15 min in 2× SSC, 0.1× SSC and then in 70% ethanol, 90% ethanol, and 100% ethanol each for 30 s. Sections were exposed to Hyperfilm-β max (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 week. Preparation of PSD Fraction—Synaptosome and PSD (one Triton X-100 extraction) of adult mouse telencephalons were prepared as described previously (36Nakazawa T. Watabe A.M. Tezuka T. Yoshida Y.

Immunocytochemistry—Hippocampal neurons were fixed with methanol for 10 min at–20 °C, blocked with 5% normal goat serum, and then incubated with appropriate antibodies. PC12 cells were infected with mock, wild-type TCGAP, or TCGAP R350I, stimulated with 50 ng/ml NGF for 48 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS, and blocked with 3% BSA/PBS, then incubated with appropriate antibodies. The primary antibodies were visualized using goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa488 (Molecular Probes) or Cy3 (KPL, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). RhoGAP Assay—The RhoGAP activity of TCGAP in mammalian cells was analyzed by the Rho effector pull-down assay as described previously (36Nakazawa T. Watabe A.M. Tezuka T. Yoshida Y. Yokoyama K.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with the expression plasmids for Myc-tagged RhoA, Cdc42, or Rac1 together with or without wild-type, R350I mutant, or Y406F mutant of TCGAP in the presence or absence of different mutants of Fyn. The cells were lysed for 5 min with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol for Cdc42 and Rac1; 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol for RhoA), and then the lysates were centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatants were incubated with 20 μg of GST-CRIB for 30 min for Cdc42 and Rac1, or 40 μg of GST-RBD for 60 min for RhoA. After washing the beads with lysis buffer, the bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Myc mAb. NGF Stimulation of PC12 Cells—Analysis of neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was performed as described previously (38Kawa S. Fujimoto J. Tezuka T. Nakazawa T. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PC12 cells infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus expressing mock, wild-type, Y406F mutant, and R350I mutant of TCGAP were selected with puromycin (2.0 μg/ml) for 48 h. The selected cells (5 × 104) were plated in 6-well plates and stimulated with NGF (50 ng/ml). The total neurite lengths of the cells were calculated with TI-Workbench software that was kindly provided by T. Inoue (University of Tokyo, Japan). Identification of TCGAP as a Novel Fyn-binding Protein—To identify proteins that interact with Fyn in the brain, we carried out yeast two-hybrid screening with full-length Fyn as bait. We obtained 80 candidate clones from a human fetal brain cDNA library comprising 8.6 × 106 individual clones. One of them encoded a partial sequence of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 894–1126) of TCGAP, a recently identified RhoGAP (33Chiang S.-H. Hwang J. Legendre M. Zhang M. Kimura A. Saltiel A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2679-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether TCGAP interacts with Fyn in mammalian cells, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding TCGAP and full-length Fyn. As shown in Fig. 1A, Fyn was co-immunoprecipitated with TCGAP. To identify the region of Fyn that interacts with TCGAP, wild-type or mutant forms of Fyn were expressed with TCGAP in HEK293T cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TCGAP interacted well with kinase-dead (K299M) and SH2-defective (R176K) mutants of Fyn (Fig. 1B). In contrast, TCGAP did not interact with an SH3-defective mutant (P134K) of Fyn, suggesting that the SH3 domain is required for TCGAP binding (Fig. 1B). Moreover, Fyn was co-immunoprecipitated with TCGAP from brain lysates of wild-type mice (Fig. 1D). Therefore, we concluded that TCGAP interacts with Fyn in vivo. Phosphorylation of TCGAP by Fyn—We next examined whether TCGAP is phosphorylated by Fyn in mammalian cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with combinations of plasmids expressing TCGAP and wild-type or mutant forms of Fyn. Co-expression of FynY531F, SH2-defective (R176K), and SH3-defective mutants (P134K) of Fyn, but not FynK299M, with TCGAP enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of TCGAP (Fig. 1C). To confirm that TCGAP is tyrosine phosphorylated in the brain, TCGAP immunoprecipitates were prepared from brain lysates of wild-type and fyn-knock-out mice and probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Fig. 1D). As shown in Fig. 1D, TCGAP was tyrosine-phosphorylated in both wild-type and fyn-knock-out mouse brain; the level of TCGAP phosphorylation was significantly decreased in fyn-knock-out mice. The ratio of TCGAP tyrosine phosphorylation in fyn-knock-out mice to that in wild-type mice was 0.45 ± 0.08 (p < 0.001, Student's t test). These results strongly suggest that TCGAP is a novel substrate for Fyn in the brain. RhoGAP Activity of TCGAP in Mammalian Cells—TCGAP shows GAP activity for Cdc42 and TC10β in vitro as described previously (33Chiang S.-H. Hwang J. Legendre M. Zhang M. Kimura A. Saltiel A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2679-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether TCGAP exhibits RhoGAP activity in mammalian cells, we applied Rho effector pull-down methods (see “Experimental Procedures”) in HEK293T cells. Wild-type TCGAP reduced the amount of GTP-loaded Cdc42 but had little effect on the GTP-load status of RhoA and Rac1 (Fig. 2A). The GAP activity of TCGAP toward Cdc42 was reduced significantly by R350I mutation of TCGAP. Arginine 350 in the GAP domain of TCGAP is conserved among the RhoGAP family proteins and is known to be required for GAP activity (42Barrett T. Xiao B. Dodson E.J. Doson G. Ludbrook S.B. Nurmahomed K. Gamblin S.J. Masacchio A. Smerdon S.J. Eccleston J.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 43Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We next examined whether Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of TCGAP affects its RhoGAP activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, co-expression of active-Fyn, FynY531F, suppressed the GAP activity of TCGAP. In contrast, a kinase-dead mutant of Fyn, FynK299M, had no effect on the GAP activity of TCGAP (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that TCGAP promotes GTP hydrolysis on Cdc42 in cells, and this GAP activity is suppressed by Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of TCGAP. Fyn-mediated Phosphorylation Site in TCGAP—Because Fyn-mediated phosphorylation suppressed the GAP activity of TCGAP, it was likely that phosphorylation occurred in the GAP domain. Among 6 tyrosine residues present in this region, only Tyr-406 matches the consensus phosphorylation site for Fyn. To examine whether Tyr-406 is phosphorylated by Fyn, HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for wild-type TCGAP or Y406F (conversion of Tyr-406 to Phe-406) mutant of TCGAP together with active-Fyn. As shown in Fig. 3A, Y406F mutation resulted in the significant reduction of the level of TCGAP phosphorylation. This result strongly suggests that Tyr-406 is one of the major Fyn-mediated phosphorylation sites in TCGAP. To examine whether Tyr-406 phosphorylation suppresses the GAP activity of TCGAP, we applied Rho effector pull-down methods. In contrast to the case with wild-type TCGAP, co-expression of active-Fyn did not suppress the GAP activity of Y406F mutant of TCGAP (Fig. 3B). In the absence of Fyn, the GAP activities of WT and Y406F TCGAP were statistically the same (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that Fyn suppresses the GAP activity of TCGAP through Tyr-406 phosphorylation. Developmental Expression of TCGAP in Brain—To examine the distribution of TCGAP mRNA in the brain, we carried out in situ hybridization analysis (Fig. 4, A and B). Prominent expression of TCGAP mRNA was detected as early as embryonic day (E) 11 in the neural epithelia around the neural lumen. In late-stage embryonic development, TCGAP mRNA was detected in the whole brain. TCGAP mRNA was expressed at high levels in olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum until 1 week after birth. At postnatal weeks 2 and 4, TCGAP mRNA was expressed at high levels in olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, and hippocampus. We next examined expression of TCGAP protein during postnatal development by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). TCGAP was expressed at high levels during the early postnatal period but gradually decreased after postnatal week 1. Taken together, these results suggest that TCGAP functions mainly in the immature brain. Subcellular Distribution of TCGAP—To examine the subcellular localization of endogenous TCGAP in neurons, 2- and 20-day-old cultured primary hippocampal neurons were stained with an antibody against TCGAP. In young neurons, TCGAP was localized throughout the cells (Fig. 5A). In mature neurons with mature synapses containing fully differentiated postsynaptic density (PSD), anti-TCGAP antibody labeled punctuate structures arrayed along dendrites, suggesting that TCGAP is localized to dendritic spines (Fig. 5B). Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions from mouse cerebral cortex showed that TCGAP was enriched in the isolated PSD fraction (Fig. 5C). NGF-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of TCGAP in PC12 Cells—To address whether TCGAP is regulated by the NGF signaling in PC12 cells, we examined phosphorylation status of TCGAP. PC12 cells supply a useful system for examining mechanisms of neuronal differentiation and signal transduction (9Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev.

TCGAP immunoprecipitates were prepared from NGF- and mock stimulated cells and probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. As shown in Fig. 6A, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of TCGAP was significantly enhanced by NGF treatment. NGF activates Src family kinases downstream of TrkA (47Wooten M.W. Vandenplas M.L. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. diaz-Meco M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8414-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To examine that the NGF-induced phosphorylation of TCGAP is dependent on Src family kinases, we treated PC12 cells with PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src family kinases or PP3, an inactive analog of PP2 (48Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, PP2 significantly inhibited NGF-induced TCGAP phosphorylation. Together with our observation that the level of TCGAP phosphorylation was reduced in fyn-knock-out mice (Fig. 1D), these data suggest that TCGAP is phosphorylated by Fyn upon NGF stimulation. Suppression of NGF-induced Neurite Outgrowth by TCGAP in PC12 Cells—To analyze the biological significance of TCGAP in neuronal cells, we examined the effect of TCGAP expression on neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Upon NGF stimulation, PC12 cells undergo neuronal differentiation accompanied by neurite outgrowth in a Cdc42-dependent manner (49Aoki K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 713-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We used a retrovirus system to express exogenous wild-type TCGAP, the GAP-defective R350I"
https://openalex.org/W2131401963,"BRCA1 has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including transcription regulation, DNA damage repair, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. We identified poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP) as a novel BRCA1-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed the interaction by in vitro assays and coimmunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. Endogenous interaction between BRCA1 and PABP was also observed. This interaction was abolished by BRCA1 cancer-associated mutations, suggesting that it may be physiologically relevant. Deletion mapping demonstrated that the RNA recognition motifs 1–4 region of PABP is required to mediate the interaction with BRCA1. To understand the biological function of the BRCA1-PABP complex, we sought to determine whether BRCA1 is a modulator of translation. We showed here that inhibition of endogenous BRCA1 using a small interfering RNA-based approach decreased protein synthesis. Conversely, overexpression of BRCA1 activated translation. Using a RNA transfection approach, we clearly showed that BRCA1 modulates translation, independently of any transcriptional activity. The data presented here suggest that BRCA1 modulates protein synthesis via its interaction with PABP, providing a novel mechanism by which BRCA1 may exert its tumor suppressor function.

The breast cancer susceptibility gene breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) acts as a tumor suppressor gene (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M. Ding W et al.Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5211) Google Scholar). Germ-line mutations of BRCA1 are found in about 40% of patients with inherited breast cancer and up to 90% of families with breast and ovarian cancer (2Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The decreased BRCA1 expression found in approximately one-third of sporadic breast tumors may also play a role in these cancers (3Thompson M.E. Jensen R.A. Obermiller P.S. Page D.L. Holt J.T. Nat.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3169-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several lines of approach tend to define the biochemical function of BRCA1 protein. BRCA1 has thus far been involved in regulation of cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, transcription, and ubiquitination (5Venkitaraman A.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Although the implication of BRCA1 in these cellular processes has been demonstrated, the exact mechanism of BRCA1 function remains unclear. The BRCA1 protein contains a RING finger at its N-terminal region (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennett L.M.

Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The majority of cancer-associated BRCA1 mutations affect the BRCT tandem, resulting in truncated products lacking one or two BRCT domains (2Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These findings together with the observation that deletion of the Brca1 BRCT domains is responsible for tumor development in mice (12Ludwig T. Fisher P. Ganesan S. Efstratiadis A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) demonstrate that BRCT domains play a central role in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor function. Several proteins interact with this region and collaborate functionally with BRCA1. For example, BRCA1 interacts with proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation such as RNA polymerase holoenzyme, CtIP (13Scully R. Anderson S.F. Chao D.M. Wei W. Ye L. Young R.A.

In this study we further explored new functions of BRCA1 through its BRCT tandem using the yeast two-hybrid approach. We show that BRCA1 interacts with poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP), 5The abbreviations used are: PABP, poly(A)-binding protein 1; CHX, cycloheximide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RRM, RNA recognition motif; eIF4G, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G; PAIP, PABP-interacting protein. 5The abbreviations used are: PABP, poly(A)-binding protein 1; CHX, cycloheximide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RRM, RNA recognition motif; eIF4G, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G; PAIP, PABP-interacting protein. a highly conserved protein involved in mRNA stabilization and translation (19Gray N.K.

Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We first demonstrated that BRCA1 binds to PABP in vitro as well as in vivo. Notably, this interaction is disrupted by germ line BRCA1 mutations that affect the BRCT repeats. We then provide evidence showing that BRCA1 can stimulate translation, supporting a model in which control of translation would be mediated in part via the BRCA1-PABP interaction. Chemicals—The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows. Mouse monoclonal antibody to human BRCA1 (OP92) was purchased from Oncogene Research Products, mouse monoclonal antibody to actin was from ICN Biochemicals, mouse monoclonal antibody to Myc (anti-Myc) from Roche Applied Science, and the mouse monoclonal antibody against the synthetic V5 epitope was from Invitrogen. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (as ascites fluids) against human PABP (clone 10E10) were gifts from Gideon Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania) (23Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody to P300 (N-15) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary antibodies used were peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences). Cycloheximide (CHX) was purchased from Sigma. Bacterial Expression Constructs—The pGEX-BRCT plasmid and the pGEX-BRCT mutants GST-BRCT-A1709E, GST-BRCT-P1749R, GST-BRCT-R1835X, and GST-BRCT-Y1853X were generated as previously described (18Magnard C. Bachelier R. Vincent A. Jaquinod M. Kieffer S. Lenoir G.M. Venezia N.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6729-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The pGEX-BRCT-N plasmid expressing the N-terminal region of BRCA1 was generated by PCR amplification of nucleotides 1–661 of BRCA1 using the cDNA of BRCA1 cloned in pCDNA3β as the template and the following primers: 5′-GCGAATTCATGGATTTATCTGCTCTTCG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACAGAATCCAAACTGATTTC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Mammalian Expression Constructs—The pCDNA3β plasmid expressing human BRCA1 full-length protein and the N-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged pCDNA3β plasmid expressing the trun-cated mutant Y1853X were previously described (24Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). The pCDNA-PABP plasmid was generated by PCR amplification of PABP cDNA using the pGEM1-PABP construct as a template (25Grange T. de Sa C.M. Oddos J. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4771-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and the primers 5′-GCTCTAGAGAGATGAACCCCAGTGCCCC-3′ and 5′-GAGCGGCCGCAACAGT'TGGAACACCGGTGGC-3′. The resultant product was inserted into the XbaI/NotI sites of pCDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen). To construct plasmids encoding PABP partial sequences, the PABP coding regions (numbers correspond to amino acids) RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) 1 and 2 (1–189), RRM3 and -4 (189–368), RRM1–4 (1–368), C1 (369–494), C2 (494–633), and C1+C2 (369–633) were PCR-amplified using pCDNA-PABP as template and the primers 5′-GCTCTAGAGAGATGAACCCCAGTGCCCC-3′ and 5′-GAGCGGCCGCTTCTTTTGCCCTAGCTCCAAG-3′, 5′-GCTCTAGAAACATGGAATTCACCAATGTTTACATCAAG-3′ and 5′-GAGCGGCCGCTTTGCGCTGAGCTAAAGCTAC-3′, 5′-GCTCTAGAGAGATGAACCCCAGTGCCCC-3′ and 5′-GAGCGGCCGCTTTGCGCTGAGCTAAAGCTAC-3′,5′-GCTCTAGAAACATGGAAGAGCGCCAGGCTCACC-3′ and 5′-GAGCGGCCGCTGCAGCTGCAGGACGTG-3′, 5′-GCTCTAGAAACATGGCAGCCGCTGCAGCTACTC-3′ and 5′-GAGCGGCCGCAACAGTTGGAACACCGGTGGC-3′,5′-GCTCTAGAAACATGGAAGAGCGCCAGGCTCACC-3′ and 5′-GAGCGGCCGCAACAGT'TGGAACACCGGTGGC-3′, respectively. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The PABP-interacting protein 1 (PAIP1) sequence was PCR-amplified from human cDNA library using the primers 5′-GCTCTAGAAGCATGTCGGACGGTTTCG-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCCTGTTTTCGCTTACGCTCTG-3′. The cDNA fragment was subcloned into the XbaI/KpnI sites of pCDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Renilla luciferase cDNA sequence was PCR-amplified from the pRL-CMV vector (Promega) using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCTACTTCGAAAGTTTATGATCCAG-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGGGTTGTTCATTTTTGAGAACTCGC-3′, digested with BamHI and SmaI (PCR added restriction sites), and cloned into the multiple cloning region of the monocistronic plasmid derived from pGEM-2 (Promega), between the T7 promoter and poly(A) stretch. The structure of the resulting DNA construct, named PGEM-Renil, was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. The luciferase sequence is under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter for in vitro transcription. Yeast Expression Constructs—The pGBT9-BRCT bait plasmid was generated by PCR amplification of the region spanning amino acids 1583–1812 of Brca1 using pUHD10.3-Brca1 construct (26Bachelier R. Dalla Venezia N. Mazoyer S. Frappart L. Lenoir G.M. Vincent A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) as a template and the primers 5′-GCGAATTCACATCTTCAGAAGAAAGAGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTTAATCATTGGAGTCTTGTGG-3′. The resultant product was inserted into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pGBT9 (Clontech) and fully sequenced. The L40 strain (Invitrogen) was cotransformed with pGBT9-BRCT and a Gal4 transactivation domain-tagged 11-day-old mouse embryo cDNA library (Clontech). Yeasts were plated on a Leu/Trp/His amino acid-depleted DOB medium containing 1 mm 3-aminotriazol. Transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity using a yeast colony-filter assay. Positive (blue) colonies were isolated, and the β-galactosidase assay was repeated. Plasmids of these colonies were recovered and used to transform an Electromax DH10B bacterial strain. The prey plasmids amplified in bacteria were retransformed with pGBT9 or pGBT9-BRCT into L40 strain and analyzed by DNA sequencing. HBL100 human epithelial mammary cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Bosc human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (or 1 g/liter glucose for metabolic labeling experiments) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin. Bosc cells were plated at 4 × 106 cells per 10-cm-diameter dish 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of BRCA1 expressing vector (pCDNA3β) and 20 μl of ExGen 500 (Euromedex) following the supplier's procedure. Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were processed for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. For metabolic labeling experiments Bosc cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells per plate in a 6-well flask 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCDNA3.1 control plasmid or pCDNA3β plasmid expressing BRCA1 and 10 μl of ExGen 500 (Euromedex). Where pCDNA-PAIP1 plasmid was used, cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid and 20 μl of ExGen. Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were processed for metabolic labeling. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad). When immunoprecipitation was performed on cellular cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, the fractions were separated as follows. Cells were pelleted, washed, and suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) for 15 min at 4 °C. An equal volume of hypotonic buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 was added and incubated an additional 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (3000 rpm, 5 min), the supernatant was collected (cytoplasmic fraction), and the pellet was resuspended in hypertonic buffer (2 mm HEPES, pH 8, 450 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (nuclear fraction) was collected by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 5 min). Lysates containing 2 mg of protein were precleared by stirring with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation immunoprecipitation was performed with the precleared lysate and 2 μg of antibody for 3 h at 4°C. Thirty microliters of protein G-Sepharose were added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer A, and proteins were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS-loading buffer and 100 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk and incubated with primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection of immunoreactive proteins by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer A supplemented with protease inhibitor (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). One mg of protein was incubated for 1 h with 100 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose beads solution to eliminate nonspecific interactions. After a centrifugation of 2 min at 5000 rpm, supernatants were incubated with 5 μg of GST or GST-BRCT proteins and 50 μl glutathione-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4°C. Protein complexes were washed three times with buffer A. Protein complexes were released by heating at 95 °C in SDS-loading buffer and 100 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting assay as described above. The presence of GST fusion proteins was examined by Coomassie Blue staining. Where indicated, lysates were treated with RNase I (0.1 mg/ml) for 1 hat room temperature. When the GST pulldown assay was performed on in vitro translated proteins, 2μg of GST or GST-BRCT proteins were incubated with 10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled protein previously synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Binding assays were carried out as above. Induced bacterial extracts containing GST, GST-BRCT, and GST-BRCA1-N (containing the N-terminal region of BRCA1) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk and incubated for 2 h with 40 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated protein in 3 ml of Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 2% nonfat milk. Membranes were washed four times, dried, and radiographed. The siRNA duplexes were purchased from Proligo (Paris, France) and provided as a purified and annealed duplexes. The sequences of these siRNAs were Si-BRCA1-1 (5′-AAGGAACCUGUCUCCACAAAGUU-3′), Si-BRCA1-2) (5′-AAGGAACCACGAUCCACAAAGUU-3′), and Si-control (5′-AACACGAUGUGACAGUGAUAUUU-3′). The DNA sequences were subjected to a BLAST analysis. For transfection, HBL100 cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells per plate in a 6-well flask 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.125 nmol of siRNA and 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using the protocol of the supplier. 72 h after transfection cells were processed for immunoblotting or metabolic labeling. After transfection of the cells with siRNAs or plasmids, cells were incubated for 1 h with 3 ml of methionine-depleted medium. Then cells were pulse-labeled in 1 ml of methionine-depleted medium supplemented with 20 μCi of [35S] methionine for 1 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested, and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as follows. Cells were first treated in lysis buffer B (10 mm Hepes-KOH pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Complete EDTA free, Roche Applied Science) for 15 min and subsequently incubated with buffer B containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 5 min. Cells were briefly centrifuged, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad). 10–20 μg of protein were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Values were normalized for sample protein contents. When newly synthesized proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, cells were lysed in buffer A and analyzed (50 μg of protein) using 6% SDS-PAGE, and labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For assessing total protein translation after treatment with CHX, cells were pretreated for 2 h with CHX (10 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, then starved, labeled (treatment with CHX continued during the methionine starvation and the radioactive pulse), and harvested as described above. For in vitro transcription DNA was linearized at the EcoRI site. Synthesis of capped transcripts was carried out with the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase as previously described (27Ohlmann T. Rau M. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). GTP concentration was reduced to 0.32 mm, and m7GpppG RNA capping analog (Invitrogen) was added at a concentration of 1.3 mm. The reaction was carried at 37 °C for 2 h. The resulting mRNAs were treated with DNase, purified from nonincorporated nucleotides by gel filtration chromatography with RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and precipitated by ethanol. The integrity of the RNAs was checked by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, and their concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry. Radiolabeled mRNAs were synthesized as described above in the presence of 10 μCi of [32P]UTP. For in vitro synthesis of unadenylated luciferase mRNAs, the plasmid DNA was linearized at the SmaI restriction site. Bosc cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells per plate in a 12-well flask 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCDNA3.1 control plasmid or pCDNA3β plasmid expressing BRCA1, Y1853X, or PAIP1 and 5 μl of ExGen 500 (Euromedex). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were transfected with 1 μg of in vitro synthesized RNA and 4 μl of DMRIE-C (Invitrogen). Cells were exposed to the RNA/DM-RIE-C mixture for 4 h, the medium was changed to fresh, serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubation was continued for an additional 6 h. Cell lysis and the analysis of translational products from transfected mRNA template were done using the Renilla luciferase assay (Promega). Values were normalized for samples protein contents. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of radiolabeled RNAs as described above. 6 h post-transfection, RNAs were isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 5 μg of total RNAs were loaded on a guanidine thiocyanate-denaturing agarose gel as described (28Goda S.K. Minton N.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3357-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and submitted to autoradiography. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed with a two-tailed paired Student's t test. Identification of PABP as a BRCA1 BRCT Tandem Interacting Protein—To identify proteins that interact with the tandem of two BRCT domains of BRCA1, we used the two-hybrid system. The mouse BRCA1 residues 1583–1812 were fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain to generate the bait construct pGBT9-BRCT. The pGBT9-BRCT demonstrated a minimal transactivation activity, which was suppressed by 3-aminotriazol when used at a concentration of 1 mm. A screen of 106 transformants of an 11-day-old mouse embryo cDNA library (29Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) yielded 273 His+ colonies. 115 β-galactosidase-positive clones were isolated. Sequence analysis of the interacting clones showed that one of them encoded amino acids 205–406 of Pabp. The protein sequence of the two BRCT domains of mouse Brca1 share 75 and 58% identity with those of human BRCA1, respectively (10Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and the protein sequence of mouse Pabp is highly conserved with that of human PABP. Therefore, we examined whether the interaction between BRCA1 and PABP was conserved in human cells. To test whether human full-length PABP directly binds to the BRCT domains of human BRCA1, a Far Western analysis was performed. The fusion proteins GST, GST-BRCT, and GST-BRCA1-N (containing the N-terminal region of BRCA1) were probed with [35S]methionine-labeled PABP. A specific hybridization was obtained with GST-BRCT only (Fig. 1A). As another approach, a GST pulldown assay was performed on Bosc cell lysates. The specific retention of PABP was observed with GST-BRCT but not with the control GST (Fig. 1B). Therefore, BRCT repeats of BRCA1 interact with full-length PABP in vitro. Because PABP associates with mRNA, it was possible that BRCA1 binds to PABP via RNA. Treatment of the cell lysates with RNase I before GST pulldown shows that the association is not mediated by RNA (Fig. 1B). To address the functional importance of the BRCT-PABP interaction, we investigated the effect of four germ line BRCA1 mutations located in BRCT domains on in vitro binding with PABP (Fig. 1C). GST pulldown assays were performed on Bosc cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 1D, the two single amino acid substitutions (A1708E and P1749R) and the two truncating mutations (R1835X and Y1853X) abolished the interaction with PABP. These results demonstrate that tumorigenic lesions of the BRCT domains prevent the association of BRCA1 with PABP, suggesting that the BRCA1-PABP interaction may be of physiologic relevance. Interaction of BRCA1 with PABP in Mammalian Cells—To determine whether BRCA1 could interact with PABP in human cells, lysates from Bosc cells transiently expressing BRCA1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-PABP antibody and further analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-BRCA1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, BRCA1 coprecipitated with PABP. The negative control, an unrelated mouse monoclonal antibody anti-V5, was unable to coprecipitate BRCA1. Anti-PABP immunoprecipitation of lysates from Bosc cells transiently expressing the BRCA1 Y1853X mutant failed to coprecipitate BRCA1 (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis confirmed that BRCA1 and the Y1853X mutant were expressed at equivalent levels after transfection (Figs. 2, A and B). This reaffirms the physiologic relevance of the interaction of BRCA1 with PABP via its BRCT tandem. To further examine whether endogenous BRCA1 and PABP form a complex, we performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis in untransfected epithelial mammary HBL100 cells. Immunoprecipitation of PABP resulted in the coprecipitation of BRCA1, whereas no bands were observed in negative control (Fig. 2C). In reciprocal experiments, anti-BRCA1 antibody coprecipitated PABP, but not the negative control (Fig. 2D). Therefore, BRCA1 and PABP form an endogenous complex in vivo. To determine whether BRCA1 and PABP interact in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, Bosc cells overexpressing BRCA1 were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. The fractionation of these cells was checked with antibodies raised against nuclear P300 and cytoplasmic actin. An immunoprecipitation assay using anti-PABP antibody resulted in the coprecipitation of BRCA1 in the cytoplasmic fraction, whereas no band was observed in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2E). An immunoprecipitation assay using an unrelated monoclonal antibody anti-V5 was used as control. Therefore, BRCA1 interacts with PABP in the cytoplasm of cells. PABP Associates with BRCA1 through Its RRM—To map the interaction domain of BRCA1 on PABP, GST pulldown assays were performed on [35S]methionine-labeled fragments of PABP. As shown in Fig. 3, the three N-terminal fragments RRM1 and -2, RRM3 and -4, and RRM1–4 clearly bound to the BRCT domains, whereas the C-terminal fragments C1, C2, and C1+C2 of PABP failed to bind. GST did not bind to any of these fragments, and GST-BRCT strongly bound to full-length PABP. It is noteworthy that the intensity of the signals obtained in Fig. 3C (RRM1–4, RRM1 and -2, and RRM3 and -4) are rather proportional to that of the radiolabeled products shown in Fig. 3B, suggesting that the BRCT domains interact with PABP through RRM1 and -2 and RRM3 and -4 with a nearly comparable efficiency. Therefore, BRCA1 interacts through its BRCT domains with the N-terminal region of PABP encompassing the four RRM motifs. This finding suggests that BRCA1 could participate in regulation of mRNA translation. Indeed, previous studies indicated that the RRM motifs of PABP interact with 3′ mRNA poly(A) tail (30Deo R.C.

Characterization of these viral TNF inhibitors from Tanapox virus, Yaba monkey tumor virus (YMTV) and a closely related version from Swinepox virus revealed dramatically differential TNF binding specificities for different mammalian species. The Tanapox virus 2L protein (TPV-2L) formed inhibitory complexes with human TNF, and interacted with monkey and canine TNF with high affinity but rabbit TNF with low affinity. On the other hand, YMTV-2L bound human and monkey TNF with high affinity but rabbit TNF with only low affinity. The TNF-BP from swinepox virus (SPV003/148) only interacted with porcine TNF with high affinity. The observed TNF binding analysis mirrored the biological activity of these TNF-binding protein to block TNF-induced cellular cytolysis. TPV-2L and YMTV-2L also inhibited the human TNF-mediated signaling in cells but TPV-2L exhibited higher affinity for human TNF (KD, 43 pm) compared with monkey (KD, 120 pm) whereas for YMTV-2L, the affinities were reversed (human TNF KD, 440 pm; monkey TNF KD, 230 pm). The interaction domain of human TNF with TNF-binding proteins is significantly different from that of TNFRs, as determined using human TNF mutants. We conclude that these poxvirus TNF-binding proteins represent a new class of TNF inhibitors and are distinct from the viral TNF receptor homologues characterized to date.

We conclude that these poxvirus TNF-binding proteins represent a new class of TNF inhibitors and are distinct from the viral TNF receptor homologues characterized to date. The complex and ever evolving interactions between host and pathogens has led to an evolutionary interplay between the host immune system and countermeasures by the pathogens. Large DNA viruses such as poxviruses, which replicate exclusively within the cytoplasm of infected cells, encode diverse immunomodulatory proteins to modulate, avoid, or diminish multiple antiviral responses mediated by hosts (1Seet B.T. Johnston J.B. Brunetti C.R. Barrett J.W. Everett H. Cameron C. Sypula J. Nazarian S.H. Lucas A. McFadden G. Annu. Rev.

TNFα, the prototype member of the TNF superfamily, forms trimers and is expressed as both a membrane-bound 26-kDa and a soluble 17-kDa form, both of which are biologically active. The biological effects of TNFα (here called TNF) are mediated by binding to two receptors, TNFR1 (p55/p60) or TNFR2 (p75/80), members of the TNFR superfamily of proteins (6Mocellin S. Rossi C.R. Pilati P. Nitti D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 7Hehlgans T. Pfeffer K. Immunology. 2005; 115: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). TNF is also directly involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, Crohn disease and other syndromes (6Mocellin S. Rossi C.R. Pilati P. Nitti D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The broad inhibitory effects of TNF have forced many viruses to acquire specific strategies to neutralize TNF or TNF-mediated responses. Of particular interest are poxvirus-encoded molecules that bind and sequester extracellular TNF prior to TNFR engagement (8Cunnion K.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 67: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Benedict C.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Rahman M. McFadden G. PLoS Pathogens. 2006; 2: 66-77Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Two classes of viral-encoded anti-TNF proteins have been described: secreted homologues of TNFRs and secreted proteins that bind TNF, termed vTNFRs and vTNF-BP, respectively. Among the poxvirus-encoded vTNFRs, two major categories have been described: the T2-like inhibitors encoded by leporipoxviruses and the cytokine response modifier (Crm)-like orthologs encoded by orthopoxviruses (8Cunnion K.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 67: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The first identified such immunomodifier targeted to TNF was the T2 TNFR homolog in Shope Fibroma virus (SFV), a leporipoxvirus, which causes tumors in rabbits (11Schreiber M. Rajarathnam K. McFadden G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1994; 204: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The function of such a soluble viral receptor mimic is to bind and sequester host-elicited TNF and LTα, thereby preventing activation of cellular TNF receptors and TNF-mediated responses that lead to downstream antiviral effects. The closely related myxoma virus encoded M-T2 is an early glycosylated, dimeric, secreted protein that specifically binds to, and inhibits rabbit TNF (11Schreiber M. Rajarathnam K. McFadden G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1994; 204: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, the M-T2 protein is also able to inhibit apoptosis in virus-infected lymphocytes (13Schreiber M. Sedger L. McFadden G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2171-2181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M-T2 knock-out myxoma virus exhibited significantly reduced infectivity in domestic rabbits susceptible to wild-type virus infection and M-T2 was the first described “viroceptor” (14Upton C. Macen J.L. Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1991; 184: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Orthopoxvirus-encoded vTNFRs, denoted CrmB, CrmC, CrmD, and CrmE, vary in ligand binding specificities and patterns of expression. Cowpox virus encodes all four Crm paralogues (15Hu F.-Q. Smith C.A. Pickup D.J. Virology. 1994; 204: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Smith C.A. Hu F.-Q. Smith T.D. Richards C.L. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Pickup D.J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), Ectromelia virus encodes only CrmD (19Smith V.P. Bryant N.A. Alcamí A. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and variola (VaV) and monkeypox virus, which causes smallpox-like disease in humans, encode CrmB only. Although all of the above vTNFRs possess the conserved TNF binding cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), CrmC and CrmE lack the 150-residue C-terminal domain present in CrmB and CrmD. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the VaV-encoded CrmB also binds to chemokines in addition to TNF (20Alejo A. Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Ho Y. Smith V.P. Saraiva M. Alcami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5995-6000Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The TNF binding CRD-containing domain remains solely in the N-terminal region of CrmB, whereas the C-terminal domain that binds chemokines represents a newly identified family of poxvirus chemokine inhibitors (20Alejo A. Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Ho Y. Smith V.P. Saraiva M. Alcami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5995-6000Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Among the vaccinia virus (VV) strains, Lister, USSR, and Evans encode CrmC and CrmE; however other strains such as Western Reserve, Copenhagen, DryVax (Wyeth), and Tian-Tan encode truncated vTNFRs that are not functional (21Alcamí A. Khanna A. Paul N.L. Smith G.L. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cowpox and mousepox virus also encode an ortholog of another TNFR family member, vCD30 that binds and inhibits CD30L/CD153 (22Panus J.F. Smith C.A. Ray C.A. Smith T.D. Patel D.D. Pickup D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8348-8353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Saraiva M. Smith P. Fallon P.G. Alcami A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel TNF inhibitor vTNF-BP was identified from Tanapox virus (TPV), a member of the Yatapoxvirus genus of poxviruses (24Lee H.-J. Essani K. Smith G.L. Virology. 2001; 281: 170-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Brunetti C.R. Paulose-Murphy M. Singh R. Qin J. Barrett J.W. Tardivel A. Schneider P. Essani K. McFadden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4831-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The vTNF-BP is encoded by ORF 2L, and related 2L ORFs are also present in other members of this genus including Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV) and Yaba monkey tumor virus (YMTV), and 2L-like ORFs are found in swinepox virus (SPV) and deerpox virus (DPV) (24Lee H.-J. Essani K. Smith G.L. Virology. 2001; 281: 170-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Brunetti C.R. Paulose-Murphy M. Singh R. Qin J. Barrett J.W. Tardivel A. Schneider P. Essani K.

Virol. 2005; 79: 966-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The TPV-encoded 2L protein (TPV-2L) binds to human TNF with very high affinity (KD, 43 pm), but failed to interact with other human cytokines or members of TNF superfamily of proteins (25Brunetti C.R. Paulose-Murphy M. Singh R. Qin J. Barrett J.W. Tardivel A. Schneider P. Essani K. McFadden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4831-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, TPV-2L protein exhibits some sequence similarity (25% identity) to the α1, α2, and α3 domains of the cellular MHC class I molecules, and the 2L family of ORFs from what appears to be a family of novel TNF inhibitors. Here, we have characterized the ligand binding and inhibitory properties of the 2L ORFs from TPV, YMTV, and swinepox virus with respect to various mammalian TNF molecules. Our results show that among this class of poxvirus-encoded TNF-binding proteins, TPV-2L exhibits relatively broader affinities for TNF from different species, whereas YMTV-2L has a less broad species range and SPV003 has strict species specificity. The viral-encoded TNF-BPs are also biochemically distinct from cellular TNFRs in terms of binding to TNF, and appear to recognize different ligand domains than the host TNFRs or the known vTNFR homologs. Recombinant human, rhesus monkey, canine, porcine, and murine TNF and human LTα were obtained from R&D biosystems. Soluble human TNFR1 and TNFR2 were obtained from BioSource International. Rabbit TNF was produced, concentrated and quantified using methods described previously (12Schreiber M. McFadden G. Virology. 1994; 204: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Swinepox virus genomic DNA was provided from the laboratory of Dr. Richard Moyer (UF, Gainesville). Human TNF mutants hTNFR32W-S86T and hTNFD143N-A145R were produced as described before (29Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The genes of interest were amplified by PCR with specific oligonucleotides, Pfu and viral DNA as template. Genes were cloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc/His (Invitrogen) or pFastBac1 (Invitrogen), and the proteins were expressed fused to the C-terminal Myc and His6 tag. The correct sequence of all DNA fragments cloned was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cloning of TPV-2L and construction of recombinant baculoviruses expressing TPV-2L has been described previously (25Brunetti C.R. Paulose-Murphy M. Singh R. Qin J. Barrett J.W. Tardivel A. Schneider P. Essani K. McFadden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4831-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cloning of the YMTV-2L Gene—The ORF 2L of the YMTV genome, corresponding to the TPV-2L gene, was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCCGATGAATAAGTTAATTTTATCG-3′ (with the BamHI site underlined) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGTCTTCTTCGTCCTC-3′ (with the XhoI site underlined). The PCR product was cloned into BamHI/XhoI-digested pcDNA3.1/Myc/His to generate plasmid pcDNAYMTV-2LMyc/His. Cloning of the SPV 003/148 Gene—The ORF 003/148 of the SPV genome, corresponding to the TPV-2L gene was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCCGATGATTACTAAAGCGATTG-3′ (with the BamHI site underlined) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGATCCTCCTCATCCTCC-3′ (with the XhoI site underlined). The PCR product was cloned into BamHI/XhoI-digested pcDNA3.1/Myc/His to generate plasmid pcDNASPV 003Myc/His. The genes YMTV-2L and SPV 003/148 from pcDNA-YMTV-2LMyc/His and pcDNA-SPV 003Myc/His, respectively were cloned into pFastBac1 (Invitrogen), and recombinant baculoviruses referred to as AcYMTV-2LMyc/His and AcSPV003Myc/His were produced by using the Bac-to-Bac expression system following the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). Briefly, plasmids were transformed into competent DH10Bac bacteria, where a transposition event generated the corresponding recombinant bacmids. These were purified and transfected into Sf21 insect cells, and the recombinant baculoviruses were harvested from the cell culture supernatants 3–5 days after transfection. These viruses were further amplified in one step to generate a higher titer recombinant virus stock for protein production. Sf21 cells were infected (multiplicity of infection of 5–10 plaque-forming units/cell) with the recombinant baculoviruses. Cell supernatants were harvested at 3–4 days postinfection (pi), clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min and then at high speed at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and then concentrated 10-fold using a 10,000-dalton ultrafiltration disc (Pall). Supernatants were then desalted and buffer-exchanged against phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm imidazole. Protein was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography (Ni2+/Co2+) following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The eluted protein was concentrated using Nanosep 10K omega microconcentrator (Pall) and further purified by applying to a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) fast protein liquid chromatography 60-ml column, and 2-ml fractions were collected. The peak fraction was further checked by Western blot analysis, concentrated, and quantified. Purified protein was analyzed by 12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue R250. The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay or absorbance measurements at 280 nm. Human, monkey, canine, rabbit, and murine TNF-mediated cytotoxicity for mouse L929 cells and porcine TNF-mediated cytotoxicity for porcine PK15 cells was examined by using a crystal violet staining method (16Smith C.A. Hu F.-Q. Smith T.D. Richards C.L. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Pickup D.J. Virology. 1996; 223: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 cells per well were plated in 12-well plates in a total volume of 500 μl of cell growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Spent medium was removed, and fresh medium containing TNF (1 ng/ml for human, monkey, rabbit, and mouse TNF, 10 ng/ml for canine TNF, and 0.075 ng/ml for porcine TNF) with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D in the presence or absence of serial dilutions of inhibitors were added. The constant amount of all these TNFs produced 100% cytolysis in this assay. After 18 h of incubation, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and stained for 10 min with 200 μl of 0.5% crystal violet in water. Plates were washed with distilled water and the indicator was solubilized with 2% sodium deoxycholate and the absorbance (A) at 570 nm was determined. All assays were performed in triplicate. Percentage of cytolysis was quantified by Equation 1.%C=[A(control well)-A(test)]/[A(control well)]×100(Eq. 1) Cytokine binding specificity and affinity constants were estimated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) using a BIAcore X biosensor. Screening of cytokines was done using the NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) sensor chip. The sensor chip surface was activated with 500 μm NiCl2 solution in eluent buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) followed by immobilization of the protein by injection of 50 nm His-tagged protein at a flow rate of 2–5 μl/min until the RU reached >3000. To monitor the binding, various cytokines were injected at a rate of 30 μl/min for 3 min. The sensor chip surface was regenerated by stripping nickel from the surface by injection of regeneration solution containing EDTA (10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.35 m EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 8.3). For kinetic analysis the recombinant proteins were immobilized at low densities of ∼500 RU on CM5 chips using standard amine-coupling chemistry. Different concentrations of the corresponding cytokine were then injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min over a period of 2 min and allowed to dissociate for an additional 5 min by allowing the running buffer HBS-EP to flow. The surface was regenerated after each injection using 10 mm acetate, pH 4.0 or 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 1.5. Bulk refractive index changes were removed by subtracting the reference flow cell responses and the average response of a blank injection was subtracted from all analyte sensograms to remove systematic artifacts. The data were analyzed globally with the BIA-evaluation 3.0 software by using a 1:1 Langmuir model. TNF-mediated IκBα depletion was tested in HeLa cells. 2 ng/ml TNF (the lowest amount that depleted maximum IκBα) was incubated with different concentration of recombinant inhibitors for 2 h at room temperature in cell growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum). The mixture was then added to 5 × 105 cells in 6-well plates with 1 μg/ml actinomycin D for 30 min. Cells were collected and processed for Western blot analyses as described before (25Brunetti C.R. Paulose-Murphy M. Singh R. Qin J. Barrett J.W. Tardivel A. Schneider P. Essani K. McFadden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4831-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Loading of equal amounts of protein from each sample was confirmed by detection of the housekeeping gene actin. Cleavage of the fluorescently labeled caspase substrate DEVD-R110 (Molecular Probes) was used to monitor TNF-induced caspase activation in HeLa cells. To measure TNF-mediated caspase activation, cells were incubated for 6 h with human TNF or LTα (as control) or TNF mixed with increasing concentrations of TPV-2L or YMTV-2L. The cells were harvested and processed according to manufacturer's protocol. Fluorescence was determined using Fluorimeter (Thermo Labsystems) and further calibrated against a standard curve generated with free R110. Expression of TPV-2L Homologues—TPV-2L encodes a high affinity human TNF-binding protein (25Brunetti C.R. Paulose-Murphy M. Singh R. Qin J. Barrett J.W. Tardivel A. Schneider P. Essani K. McFadden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4831-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The closest relatives of this protein are present in other members of the Yatapox viruses, the single member of the Suipoxvirus (swinepox) and the recently sequenced but, still unclassified, deerpox virus (27Afonso C.L. Delhon G. Tulman E.R. Lu Z. Zsak A. Becerra V.M. Zsak L. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 966-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment showed considerable divergence (∼31% identity) among these newly identified class of poxvirus-encoded MHC class I-like TNF-binding proteins. TPV-2L is most similar to YLDV-2L (97%) and YMTV-2L (73%) and 37% identical to SPV003 and DPV008. SPV003 and DPV008 share 57% identity between them (Table 1 and supplementary Fig. S2). To characterize the 2L family of vTNF-BPs, we have cloned and expressed TPV-2L, YMTV-2L, and SPV003 as Myc-His-tagged recombinant proteins using the baculovirus expression system (BES). All the recombinant proteins were secreted from baculovirus-infected cells and have similar molecular mass of about 47 kDa (Fig. 1).TABLE 1Identity/similarity matrix (percent identity (above diagonal) and percent similarity (below diagonal)) of poxvirus MHC class I-like vTNF-BPsTPV-2LYLDV-2LYMTV-2LSPV003DPV008TPV-2L97733737YLDV-2L97713737YMTV-2L81803437SPV00350494857DPV00851515172 Open table in a new tab Analysis of vTNF-BPs Using SPR—Although the evolutionary host of the Yatapox viruses is unknown, based on the pathogenicity to primates and the presence of 2L-related genes in multiple poxviruses that infect other mammalian species, we speculated that the 2L family of proteins might bind to TNF from other species. Previous studies using SPR have demonstrated that recombinant TPV-2L expressed using BES, bound to human TNF with high affinity (KD, 43 pm); however it did not bind to rat or mouse TNF and other members of TNF superfamily of proteins (25Brunetti C.R. Paulose-Murphy M. Singh R. Qin J. Barrett J.W. Tardivel A. Schneider P. Essani K. McFadden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4831-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To screen for potential interacting TNF from different species and other cytokines, we immobilized recombinant TPV-2L, YMTV-2L, and SPV003 at high density (∼2000–3000 RU) on NTA sensor chip. Various TNF ligands and cytokines were injected over the control (flow cell 1) and recombinant protein surface (flow cell 2). The interacting ligands that were positive on NTA sensor chips were further confirmed using CM5 chips. TPV-2L, in addition to human TNF, also bound to rhesus monkey, canine, and rabbit TNF (Fig. 2A). The recombinant YMTV-2L bound to human, rhesus monkey, and rabbit TNF but not to canine, porcine, murine, or rat TNF (Fig. 2B). Neither one could interact with other cytokines tested including LTα, IL-2, IL-5, or IFNγ. The recombinant SPV003, on the other hand bound to only porcine TNF with high affinity (Fig. 2C). Kinetic and Affinity Analysis of the TPV-2L Family Members with TNF—To more accurately assess the affinity of the recombinant TPV-2L family of proteins with TNF, we performed individual kinetic binding analysis of various species of TNF. The recombinant proteins were immobilized at low densities of ∼500 RU on CM5 chips and varying concentrations of TNF applied on them. Following an association period of 120 s, running buffer HBS-EP was injected to monitor the dissociation phase of binding. Table 2 summarizes the kinetic binding parameters of TPV-2L, YMTV-2L, and SPV003 to various species of TNF. TPV-2L bound with high affinity to TNF from rhesus monkey (KD, 120 pm) and dogs (canine; KD, 250 pm) and with moderate affinity to rabbit TNF (KD, 4 nm) (Fig. 3A). Although we observed some TPV-2L bound to porcine TNF at high concentration on NTA sensor chip surface, the interaction was kinetically insignificant (data not shown). Kinetic analysis demonstrated that human TNF exhibits a more rapid association rate (on-rate) than TNF from other species, while the dissociation rate (off-rate) of human, monkey, and canine TNF are all very slow. The KD of human TNF was also 3- and 6-fold lower than monkey and canine TNF, respectively. In contrast, rabbit TNF demonstrated slower association and relatively fast dissociation rate resulting lower affinity with a KD of 4 nm.TABLE 2Kinetic binding parameters and affinity constants of vTNF-BPs to various TNFTNF-BPTNFKaKdKDχ21/ms1/snmTPV-2LHuman TNF5.26e6 ± 0.25e62.25e−4 ± 0.31e−40.0431.6Monkey TNF1.70e6 ± 0.13e62.14e−4 ± 0.12e−40.1201.9Canine TNF2.26e6 ± 0.21e65.76e−4 ± 0.62e−40.2502.0Rabbit TNF2.38e5 ± 0.10e59.47e−4 ± 0.21e−44.000.8YMTV-2LHuman TNF2.71e6 ± 0.32e61.20e−3 ± 0.10e−30.4402.0Monkey TNF4.00e6 ± 0.41e69.36e−4 ± 0.64e−40.2301.9Rabbit TNF2.59e5 ± 0.12e51.03e−3 ± 0.20e−34.001.2SPV003Porcine TNF1.01e6 ± 0.48e62.38e−4 ± 0.29e−40.2402.0 Open table in a new tab SPR analysis using a CM5 chip demonstrated that YMTV-2L bound with high affinity to both human (KD, 440 pm) and monkey TNF (KD, 230 pm) but the affinity for monkey TNF was about 2-fold higher than for human TNF (Fig. 3B). This difference is explained because monkey TNF has a relatively rapid association and slower dissociation rate than human TNF. However, compared with TPV-2L, YMTV-2L has a 10-fold faster dissociation rate with human TNF that resulted in about a 10-fold higher KD. Rabbit TNF also bound to YMTV-2L with moderate affinity (KD of 4 nm). Canine TNF bound to YMTV-2L at high density on NTA sensor chip surface, but the interaction was kinetically insignificant (data not shown). To determine the affinity of porcine TNF with SPV003, the recombinant protein was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip and varying concentrations of porcine TNF were applied. Porcine TNF bound with high affinity to SPV003 with a KD of 240 pm (Fig. 3C). Porcine TNF bound with a relatively fast association rate and a very slow dissociation rate, which is similar to binding of human and monkey TNF with TPV-2L. Inhibition of TNF-mediated Cytotoxicity by TPV-2L Family Members—The inhibition of TNF-mediated biological activity by TPV-2L, YMTV-2L, and SPV003 was tested by cytotoxicity assay using murine L929 (for human, monkey, canine, and rabbit TNF) cells and porcine PK15 cells (for porcine TNF). In addition to human TNF, TPV-2L was also able to inhibit the cytolysis caused by rhesus monkey and canine TNF but not by rabbit or porcine TNF (Fig. 4A). The IC50 of TPV-2L to neutralize human and monkey TNF was less than 1 nm, whereas for canine TNF it was somewhat higher (24 nm). To quantitatively neutralize human and monkey TNF (60 pm), about 18-fold molar excess of TPV-2L was required, whereas in the case of canine TNF (600 pm) about 40-fold molar excess of the recombinant protein was required. The inhibition of TNF-mediated cytotoxicity by TPV-2L family members closely matched their interaction kinetics. YMTV-2L was able to inhibit the cytolysis caused by human and monkey TNF but not by rabbit or canine TNF (Fig. 4B). The IC50 of YMTV-2L to neutralize human TNF (19 nm) was slightly higher than the monkey TNF (11 nm), reflecting the better affinity for monkey TNF, as observed with kinetic analysis. To neutralize human TNF (60 pm), about 300-fold molar excess of YMTV-2L was required while for monkey TNF (60 pm) it was about 200-fold molar excess of the protein. However, YMTV-2L has about 10-fold lower inhibitory activity than TPV-2L with human and monkey TNF. To determine whether SPV003 could inhibit the biological activity of porcine TNF, the cytotoxicity assay was carried out using porcine PK15 cells (Fig. 4C). SPV003 was able to inhibit the cytolysis caused by porcine TNF but not by TNF from other species. The IC50 of SPV003 to neutralize porcine TNF was 6 nm, which is about 1300-fold molar excess to porcine TNF (4.5 pm) used.

TIMP-4 is similar in structure to TIMP-2 but is unable to support the activation of the proenzyme. Several reports have highlighted the importance of the TIMP-2 C-terminal domain in the pro-MMP-2 activation complex; however, very little is known about the role of the extended AB loop of TIMP-2 in this mechanism even though it has been shown to interact with MT1-MMP. In this study we show by mutagenesis and kinetic analysis that it is possible to transfer the MT1-MMP binding affinity of the TIMP-2 AB loop to TIMP-4 but that its transplantation into TIMP-4 does not endow the inhibitor with pro-MMP-2 activating activity. However, transfer of both the AB loop and C-terminal domain of TIMP-2 to TIMP-4 generates a mutant that can activate pro-MMP-2 and so demonstrates that both these regions of TIMP-2 are important for the activation process.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3172) Google Scholar). MMP activity is associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and neovascularization. The activities of various MMPs are controlled at the protein level via inhibition and activation by the following four homologous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs): TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4, the most recent member of the family. TIMPs inhibit the MMPs in a 1:1 stoichiometry by tightly binding to the active site of the enzyme primarily through their N-terminal domain (4Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, TIMP binding and inhibition are improved by contacts with sites on the C-terminal domain of both the enzyme and the inhibitor (5Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Blocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). All four TIMPs inhibit active forms of most MMPs, but some differences in their inhibitory properties have been reported. For example, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4 are effective inhibitors of the membrane-bound MMPs, whereas TIMP-1 is a very poor inhibitor of these enzymes (6English W.R. Puente X.S. Freije J.M. Knauper V.

TIMPs have no inhibitory activity against astacins, but TIMP-3 and to some extent TIMP-1 have been shown to be active against the ADAMs. TIMP-3 inhibits ADAM-10, -12, and -17 and the aggrecan-degrading enzymes ADAM-TS4 and ADAM-TS5, whereas TIMP-1 inhibits ADAM-10 (7Amour A.

The association of TIMPs with pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 is also specific. TIMP-2 binds to pro-MMP-2 through the hemopexin-like domain of the enzyme and facilitates enzyme activation, an action that is unique to TIMP-2; TIMP-1 binds to pro-MMP-9, whereas TIMP-3 binds to both proenzymes (10Murphy G.

Recent mutagenesis studies by several groups have identified residues Glu192 and Asp193 of the C-terminal “tail” of TIMP-2 as the key residues for binding to pro-MMP-2 (15Kai H.S. Butler G.S.

Soloway P. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. Knauper V. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The lack of these residues in the TIMP-4 C-terminal tail probably reduces the stability of complex formation with the hemopexin-like domain of pro-MMP-2 leading to the inability of TIMP-4 to promote activation of pro-MMP-2. These findings were substantiated by the structural study of the pro-MMP-2-TIMP-2 complex by Morgunova et al. (17Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Another common feature of TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 is the extended hairpin between strands A and B. We had shown previously that Tyr36 at the tip of the hairpin in TIMP-2 makes unique and specific interactions with MT1-MMP at a site away from the catalytic site of the enzyme (18Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. Schade van Westrum S. Crabbe T. Clements J. d'Ortho M.-P. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Our aim in this paper was to investigate the importance of this region in TIMP-4 for MT1-MMP inhibition and whether the extended AB loop region of TIMP-2 is required for the pro-MMP-2 activation complex. First, we created a number of N-TIMP-4 constructs, one without the AB loop and others where the AB loop of TIMP-4 had been replaced with elements of the TIMP-2 loop. Kinetic analyses of the mutants showed that they were superior inhibitors of MT1-MMP compared with N-TIMP-2 and N-TIMP-4. Second, we then fused these N-TIMP-4 mutants to the C-terminal domain of either TIMP-2 or TIMP-4 and investigated whether they potentiate activation of pro-MMP-2 in a dose-dependent manner. For this study we used an in vitro cell membrane-based assay derived from TIMP-2–/– cells. Materials—All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Restriction enzymes and Pwo DNA polymerase were obtained from Roche Applied Science. For the kinetic experiments the fluorometric substrate QF24 (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2) was used (33Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Kinetic assays were performed at 27 °C in fluorescence assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, 1% Me2SO, 0.02% NaN3) with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorimeter equipped with thermostatically controlled cuvette holders. Preparation of N-terminal and Full-length TIMPs—Construction of point and deletion/insertion mutants into either N-TIMP-2 or N-TIMP-4 sequences was carried out by a two-step PCR protocol. In step 1, the desired construct was amplified by PCR in two parts by using oligonucleotides coding for the mutation at their translated C and/or N termini. The PCR primers coding for the sequence where the two parts of the construct were to be joined were 5′-phosphorylated in order to allow subsequent ligation. The PCR fragments were gel-purified and ligated using T4 ligase. In step 2, nonmutagenic primers were used to amplify the final construct using as template the ligation mixture from step 1. Full-length TIMP-2 constructs were generated by ligation of the appropriately engineered N-terminal domain with the C-terminal domain of wild-type TIMP-2 using the available BamHI site at position 125 in the coding sequence. Full-length TIMP-4 constructs were generated in a similar way using the XcmI site at position 376 in the coding sequence. This restriction site was also used to generate the chimeric T2AB-NT4#CT2 and IYG-NT4#CT2 mutants by taking the wild-type C-terminal domain from the previously described NT4#CT2 construct (16Worley J.R. Thompkins P.B. Hutton M. Soloway P. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. Knauper V. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All constructs were inserted into pET23a (Novagen) and sequenced to confirm their identity. The sequences for human TIMP-2 and murine TIMP-4 were used in this study. Protein Production—Active TIMP proteins were prepared from inclusion bodies after expression in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and refolded as described previously (20Butler G.S. Apte S.S.

In some cases it was found that addition of 0.5 m l-arginine to the refolding buffer was necessary for efficient renaturation of the protein. All proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography, and their activities were determined by titration against MMP-2 and MMP-3 (22Lee M.H. Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Pro-MMP-2 as well as the catalytic (Δ269–559; MT1-MMPcat) and soluble ectodomain (Δ501-509; MT1-MMPsoluble) forms of MT1-MMP were purified from mammalian cells as described previously (23Will H.

Samples analyzed by zymography were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions on 7% polyacrylamide gels copolymerized with 0.5 mg/ml gelatin.

Active MT1-MMPcat was then added at 2-fold molar excess, and the mixture was incubated for a further 4 h at 4 °Cto allow trimolecular complex formation. The mixtures were then applied to gelatin-agarose mini columns (50 μl), and the columns were washed with TCAB buffer containing 1 m NaCl (wash buffer). Pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-2-bound proteins were eluted with 10% Me2SO in wash buffer, and the elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were developed using polyclonal antibodies to MT1-MMP, TIMP-4, TIMP-2, pro-MMP-2, and a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Antibody staining was visualized by ECL. Inhibition Constant Measurement (Kiapp)—MMP-2 (0.05 nm) and MT1-MMP (0.15 nm) were preincubated with increasing concentrations of the N-terminal or the full-length TIMP mutants. Incubation was performed at room temperature for 3 h before steady-state measurement (Vs). Reactions were initiated by addition of the quenched fluorescent substrate QF24 to a final concentration of 1 μm. The Kappi was determined from the steady-state rates plotted against TIMP concentration. All data were fitted into the tight binding equation using the computer program Grafit to obtain an estimation of Kappi values using Equation 1 (27Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 201-301Google Scholar). Vs=Vo/2Et×Et-It-Kiapp+Kiapp+It-Et2+4EtKiapp1/2(Eq. 1) where Vo is the rate in the absence of inhibitor; Et is the total enzyme concentration, and It is the total inhibitor concentration. Association Rate Constant Measurement (kon)—Association rate measurements (kon) were performed by adding different concentrations of the TIMP mutants to MMP-2 (0.015 nm) or MT1-MMP (0.05 nm). The rate of inhibition was followed using a continuous fluorometric assay at 27 °C until steady state had been reached. The progress curves were analyzed using the program Grafit and Equation 2 (27Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T.

When 80% confluent, the cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 9.0, to remove MT1-MMP-associated BB94, scraped from the flasks, and pelleted by centrifugation (1200 × g). Lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane, and incubated on ice before homogenization through a narrow gauge needle (26-gauge) as described by Worley et al.

Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at low speed (28,000 × g), and the crude plasma membranes were isolated by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,0000 × g for 1 h. Membrane pellets were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Brij-35, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. For subsequent experiments, the membranes were diluted into the same buffer but containing only 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. Design of AB Loop Mutants—In our previous kinetic study (19Williamson R.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32966-32970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we showed that the side chain of Tyr36 in the AB loop of N-TIMP-2 was responsible for a specific interaction with the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP, increasing the rate of inhibition (kon) by 180-fold and the affinity (Ki) by 110-fold when compared with the Y36G N-TIMP-2 mutant. N-TIMP-4 inhibits MT1-MMPcat with an affinity comparable with that of N-TIMP-2 but associates with the proteinase at a 20-fold slower rate (Table 1). To determine whether the extended AB loop of TIMP-4 is similarly important for MT1-MMP interaction and to further investigate the properties of the TIMP-2 AB loop, we constructed a series of mutations where the extended AB loop of N-TIMP-4 was either deleted or replaced with the corresponding region of TIMP-2 (Fig. 1). Four N-TIMP-4 mutants were constructed and expressed as follows: (i) the deletion of the entire extended AB loop of TIMP-4 (residues Lys33–Gln39); (ii) the exchange of the entire AB loop of TIMP-4 (Pro30–Lys40) with that from TIMP-2 (Asp30–Lys41); (iii) the exchange of the tip of the AB loop of TIMP-4 (Pro35–Ala36) with that of TIMP-2 (Ile35–Gly37); and (iv) the exchange of aspartic acid for asparagine at position 37. These four N-TIMP-4 mutants are referred to as ΔAB-NT4, T2AB-NT4, IYG-NT4, and D37N-NT4 respectively.TABLE 1Association rate constants (kon) and apparent inhibition constants (Kiapp) for the interaction of the AB loop mutants of N-TIMP-4 with the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (MT1-MMPcat) and MMP-2N-TIMPMT1-MMPcat, konMMP-2, konMT1-MMPcat, KiappMMP-2, Kiapp×10-6 m-1 s-1nmN-TIMP23.68 ± 0.030.169 ± 0.0051.2 ± 0.40.042 ± 0.014N-TIMP40.1635 ± 0.010.043 ± 0.011.07 ± 0.060.3 ± 0.002ΔAB-NT40.0532 ± 0.10.023 ± 0.025.0 ± 0.30.86 ± 0.09T2AB-NT44.73 ± 0.090.05 ± 0.01<0.050.088 ± 0.01IYG-NT41.72 ± 0.440.028 ± 0.001<0.050.4 ± 0.005D37N-NT40.56 ± 0.070.02 ± 0.0080.57 ± 0.030.137 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab To investigate the role of the AB loop of TIMP-2 in pro-MMP-2 activation, full-length TIMP-2 mutants and TIMP-4/TIMP-2 chimeras were constructed and expressed. These mutants include the following: (i) deletion of the extended AB loop from full-length TIMP-2 (residues Asp34–Ile41); (ii) the exchange of the tip of the AB loop of full-length TIMP-4 (Pro35–Ala36) with IYG from the tip of the TIMP-2 AB loop; (iii) the same AB loop exchange as ii above but with the C-terminal subdomain of TIMP-4 replaced with that from TIMP-2, and (iv) the same N-TIMP-4/C-TIMP-2 construct as in iii above but with the entire AB loop of TIMP-4 (Pro30–Lys40) exchanged with that of TIMP-2 (Asp30–Lys41). These mutants are referred to as ΔAB-T2, IYG-T4, IYG-NT4#CT2, and T2AB-NT4#CT2, respectively. The boundaries of the N- and C-terminal domain are shown in Fig. 2, and the mutations made in the AB loop regions are shown in Fig. 1. Expression and Refolding of N-TIMP and Full-length TIMP Constructs—All proteins were expressed in E. coli and refolded from inclusion bodies according to the procedure developed for N-TIMP-2 (21Williamson R.A. Natalia D. Gee C.K. Murphy G. Carr M.D. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ΔAB mutants of N-TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 required the addition of 0.5 m l-arginine in the refolding buffer to achieve appreciable yields of renatured protein. The mutant TIMPs were purified by ion exchange chromatography and analyzed on reducing and nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. No evidence of band smearing was seen on nonreducing gels, which is taken to be a good indicator of correct disulfide bond formation (data not shown). The structural authenticity of the constructs was confirmed by electrospray mass-spectrometry, and the constructs were found to be between 70 and 80% active by active site titration against MMP-2 (data not shown). Previous structural work has shown that the AB loop of TIMP is highly solvent-exposed and can accommodate changes to its sequence without any perturbation of the rest of the protein structure (19Williamson R.A. Hutton M. Vogt G. Rapti M. Knauper V. Carr M.D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32966-32970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Kinetic Analysis of N-TIMP-4 Mutants with Structural Features from the AB Loop of TIMP-2—Each of the N-TIMP-4 mutants was assessed for its rate of association (kon) and the final equilibrium constant (Kappi) with MMP-2 and the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (Table 1). Deletion of the entire tip of the AB loop of the molecule (ΔAB-NT4) resulted in a 3-fold decrease in the association rate and a 5-fold increase in the apparent inhibition constant with MT1-MMP (Fig. 3A). These values were not as dramatic as the values obtained when the AB loop of N-TIMP-2 was deleted (200-fold decrease in kon and 100-fold increase in Kappi (18Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. Schade van Westrum S. Crabbe T. Clements J. d'Ortho M.-P. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar)). It therefore appears that the extended AB loop region in N-TIMP-4 is not as important for the MT1-MMP interaction as the corresponding region in N-TIMP-2. This finding was supported by analysis of the loop replacement mutant (T2AB-NT4). The association rate for MT1-MMP binding for this mutant was increased 30-fold, and the binding affinity for MT1-MMP was 22-fold lower than that of wild-type N-TIMP-4 (Fig. 3B). Clearly it is possible to transfer the MT1-MMP binding functionality of the N-TIMP-2 AB loop to N-TIMP-4. Previous work with N-TIMP-2 has shown that this interaction is largely because of residue Tyr36 at the tip of the AB hairpin (18Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. Schade van Westrum S. Crabbe T. Clements J. d'Ortho M.-P. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), and the results from the IYG-NT4 mutant, where only the residues at the tip of the hairpin were exchanged, confirm this finding. The association rate of this mutant for MT1-MMP was increased 10-fold and the binding affinity (Kappi) reduced by over 20-fold (Fig. 3B). The N-TIMP-4 mutants showed no appreciable difference in their inhibition constant or rate of binding to MMP-2. This result is similar to that seen for N-TIMP-2 (19Williamson R.A. Hutton M. Vogt G. Rapti M. Knauper V. Carr M.D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32966-32970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and demonstrates that no significant inhibitory interactions are made by the extended AB loop of N-TIMP-2 and N-TIMP-4 with MMP-2. Exchanging Asn38 in N-TIMP-2 with Asp (the corresponding residue in N-TIMP-4) resulted in a 50-fold increase in binding affinity (19Williamson R.A. Hutton M. Vogt G. Rapti M. Knauper V. Carr M.D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32966-32970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was speculated that Asp37 might compensate for the lack of Tyr36 in N-TIMP-4, allowing the two inhibitors to have similar overall binding constants for MT1-MMP (19Williamson R.A. Hutton M. Vogt G. Rapti M. Knauper V. Carr M.D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32966-32970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Deletion of Asp37 as part of the extended AB hairpin from N-TIMP-4 (ΔAB-NT4, where only a modest 5-fold increase on Kappi was seen) and exchange of Asp37 for Asn (the corresponding TIMP-2 residue) has disproved this hypothesis. The D37N-NT4 mutant showed only a small change in the association rate (3-fold increase) and binding affinity (2-fold decrease) for MT1-MMP. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that Asp37 of N-TIMP-4 is responsible for any binding interactions with MT1-MMP, and the effect of the Asn to Asp change in N-TIMP-2 appears to be unique to this inhibitor. Kinetic Analysis of the Full-length TIMP-2 Mutants and TIMP-4#TIMP-2 Chimeras—The association rate constant (kon) for TIMP-4 binding to MT1-MMP was smaller and the inhibition constant (Kappi) value obtained slightly larger than that for TIMP-2 (Table 2). Comparison of the full-length and C-terminally truncated constructs showed that the C-terminal subdomains of both TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 make significant interactions with the MT1-MMP catalytic domain. The binding constant for the interaction of full-length TIMP-2 with MT1-MMPcat was 46-fold lower than the N-terminal domain, and a similar comparison for TIMP-4 revealed a 6.7-fold decrease. In contrast, the presence of the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain of MT1-MMP had no effect on the inhibitory binding of TIMP-2 and only a small effect on TIMP-4 (Table 2).TABLE 2Association rates (kon) and apparent inhibition constants (Kiapp) determined for the full-length TIMP constructs against the catalytic and soluble form of MT1-MMPConstructMT1-MMPsoluble, konMT1-MMPcat, konMT1-MMPsoluble, KiappMT1-MMPcat, Kiapp× 10-6 m-1 s-1nmTIMP22.44 ± 0.362.0 ± 0.010.0240.026ΔAB-T20.2 ± 0.070.14 ± 0.076.5 ± 0.75.5 ± 0.4TIMP40.543 ± 0.0050.88 ± 0.09<0.050.16 ± 0.01IYG-T41.37 ± 0.331.86 ± 0.05<0.05<0.05IYG-NT4#CT20.4 ± 0.0091.12 ± 0.01<0.050.08 ± 0.001T2AB-NT4#CT23.95 ± 0.40.9 ± 0.02<0.050.09 ± 0.002 Open table in a new tab The MT1-MMP binding constants obtained for the loopless TIMP-2 (ΔAB-T2) help to confirm our previous findings with N-TIMP-2 (19Williamson R.A.

Deletion of the AB loop reduces the affinity of TIMP-2 for MT1-MMP (both catalytic and soluble constructs) by over 200-fold. However, the effect of the AB loop mutations on the rate of association was less marked for full-length TIMP-2 than the N-TIMP-2. The change in kon for ΔAB-NT2 binding to MT1-MMPcat was 200-fold lower than the wild-type compared with only 14-fold lower for ΔAB-T2. This difference must be because of the presence of the C-terminal domain, but it is interesting to note that no elevation of kon is seen for the full-length wild-type inhibitor compared with its N-terminal domain. Kinetic analysis of the full-length TIMP-4 mutant (IYG-T4) and the TIMP-4/TIMP-2 chimeras showed that the binding constants and association rates for MT1-MMP were decreased and increased, respectively, by incorporating either the entire AB loop of TIMP-2 or just its tip (IYG). However, as seen for the full-length TIMP-2 mutants, these changes were more modest than seen for the same mutations in the isolated TIMP-4 N-terminal domain (Table 1). The transfer of the C-terminal domain of TIMP-2 to the IYG-T4 mutant (IYG-NT4#CT2) had only a small effect on kon and Kiapp values. Binding of TIMP-2, TIMP-4, and Mutant Constructs to Pro-MMP-2 and MT1-MMP—It has been well documented that TIMP-4 does not support the activation of pro-MMP-2 by MT1-MMP on the cell surface (14Hernandez-Barrantes S.

The formation of a stable trimolecular complex between TIMP-2, pro-MMP-2, and MT1-MMP is believed to be a key step in the process of pro-MMP-2 activation.
