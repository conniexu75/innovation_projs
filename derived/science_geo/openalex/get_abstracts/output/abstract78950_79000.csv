https://openalex.org/W2082937553,"A PROCEDURE has been developed for the visualization of the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglucose isomerase, after electrophoresis in a starch gel. The staining mixture applied to the sliced gel surface consists of fructose-6-phosphate (free of glucose-6-phosphate), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP, phenazine methosulphate and the tetrazolium salt MTT. The formation of glucose-6-phosphate by the isomerase is coupled to the reduction of the tetrazolium dye, which turns blue."
https://openalex.org/W2076915589,"Neurons have generally been thought to produce only one synaptic action on any particular cell which they innervate. An identified interneuron in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia mediates both direct excitation and inhibition to an identified follower cell. At low firing rates the interneuron produces excitatory postsynaptic potentials; however at higher firing rates these gradually diminish in size and eventually invert to inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence indicates that the connection between these cells is monosynaptic, and that a single transmitter, acetylcholine, mediates both actions. These opposite synaptic responses appear to result from the transmitter's acting on two types of postsynaptic receptors having different thresholds for activation and different susceptibilities for desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2023024605,"Since the discovery of the first potent mutagens over 20 years ago, progress in mutation research has been rapid. Many new mutagens, belonging to a variety of chemical classes, have been discovered, and for some of them the reaction with DNA in vitro has been established. It seems that the findings of these chemical investigations usually also apply to viruses which are treated outside the cell. This has made chemical mutagens into an important tool for the analysis of the genetic code. When DNA is treated inside the cell, its reactions would not be expected to be always identical with those observed in vitro; in one case they have, indeed, been found to be different."
https://openalex.org/W2082386745,"PRODUCTION of ultrasound by baby rodents has been reported by Zippelius and Schleidt1 in Apodemus f. flavicollis Melchior, Mus musculus domesticus Rutty, and Mictrotus a. arvalis Pallas, and by Noirot2,3 in baby mice, Clethrionomys glareolus Schr., Mesocricetus auratus Waterhouse and albino rats. I have now confirmed this phenomenon for the young of Clethrionomys, Mesocricetus and laboratory rats and mice, and extended it to the young of Acomys caharinus (Desmarest), Meriones shawi Rozet, M. unguiculatus Milne-Edwards, a species of Gerbillus, Apodemus sylvaticus (L.), Mus minutoides and a species of Thamnomys."

https://openalex.org/W2068495153,"A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that continues to generate electrical power as long as reactants are supplied and products are removed at properly controlled rates. An assembly of cells is required within which the conversion of chemical to electrical energy occurs; also required is a set of auxiliary components to supply the reactants and remove the products (including waste heat) under controlled steady-state conditions. In addition to the desired energy-conversion reactions, there are deleterious side reactions that can impair fuel economy. From knowledge of these factors influencing the possible reactions, and guided by principles of elementary chemical thermodynamics, the electrochemist can select optimum conditions for cell performance. It is then the job of the engineer to design auxiliary components and controlling devices to provide the electrochemical cells with the best possible approach to these optimum conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1976810943,The radiocarbon content of contemporary pre-bomb marine shells from the region of upwelling of the Pacific coast of South America has been determined and found to be somewhat similar to the content of shells from the coast of California and the west coast of Mexico. Deviations of up to -8.5 percent with reference to the contemporary biospheric carbon-14 standard have been observed for the Peruvian coast. Values of from -0.35 to -4.04 percent have been obtained for marine shells from the Galopagos group. Problems associated with radiocarbon dates based on shells are discussed.

Where the races are sympatric they populate different habitats. Such intensive local ecological sorting of morphologically similar individuals accumulating different, highly specialized metabolic end products appears to be unknown in other plants."

https://openalex.org/W2021105383,"Since many of the problems that beset readers, authors, and publishers of scientific journals are caused by the growth of science or by the frailties of human nature, we cannot hope for complete solutions. In an effort to make progress, within the framework of the possible, we propose that journals stop binding papers into issues and, instead, distribute to each subscriber a personalized stream of papers, abstracts, and titles. This type of distribution, which has been made possible by the advent of high-speed computers, would not affect the traditional roles of editors, referees, and libraries. We also propose that journals recognize the need for very rapid communication in certain fields, and meet the threat of public preprint-exchange systems in these fields by themselves publishing preprints in an appropriately limited manner."

In most species the products of apical secretion from the SCO may pass, as does Reissner's fibre, through the ventricles of the brain and the central canal to the posterior end of the spinal cord1,2. The function of the SCO is not yet known."
https://openalex.org/W2141996091,"Coleonyx v. variegatus is adapted to feed voraciously after deprivation of food and to withstand long periods without food. In 4 days specimens converted enough food into reserves to increase their weight by about 50 percent. Total deprivation of food resulted in very gradual loss of weight, which, if maintained, would result in 4 days of feeding being sufficient to sustain the animal for periods of 6 to 9 months."

At 4 weeks of age, these chickens and control chickens received lyophilized bovine spinal cord emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. Agammaglobulinemic chickens developed the lesions of allergic encephalomyelitis with the same frequency and intensity as the controls. Our findings support the contention that antibodies are not necessary for the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis."

Under comparable conditions. Chlorella 1-9-30 has the same temperature range for growth as has Chlorella 7-11-05, but it generally has a higher growth rate. It also differs from Chlorella 7-11-05 morphologically. Because of its high capacity for organic synthesis, Chlorella 1-9-30 may be useful in biochemical, biophysical, and physiological research."

https://openalex.org/W1975811259,"Electrical heat sources implanted in the abdominal cavities of sheep were heated to give initial temperatures of 42 degrees and 45 degrees C at the surfaces of the heaters. During 18 days of constant heating, a vascularized connective-tissue envelope encapsulated the heat sources, and the temperatures at the surfaces of the heaters declined 0.8 degrees and 1.8 degrees C, respectively. The degree of vascularization and the magnitude of the decrease in the surface temperature appeared to be related to the proximity of the tissue's initial temperature to 45 degrees C, a temperature ordinarily considered detrimental to cell structure. The vascularization thus appears to be adaptive."

https://openalex.org/W2057686089,"MICROBIOLOGISTS call yeast cells and bacteria devoid of their cell wall “protoplasts”1. According to a 100 yr old definition the protoplast represents the totality of the living cell constituents quite independent of whether the cell is coated by a wall or not. The general cytological term has therefore unfortunately been narrowed by considering the “protoplast” as the result of the removal of the cell wall. In seminars and symposia on “protoplasts”, the term is used for a cytological speciality which covers only a small sector of the wide classical concept, as represented by the publications in the journal Protoplasma and the monographs of Plasmatologia which are concerned with all aspects of living matter, and not only with the problem of whether and how the lost cell wall can be regenerated."

https://openalex.org/W1975174939,Undersea observations from various submersibles reveal penetration by ambient light to depths as great as 700 meters. The range of horizontal viewing under ambient light in offshore tropic and subtropic areas varies from 5 to 6 meters (estimated) at 300-meter depth to more than 60 meters at 183-meter depth. Such observations indicate that ambient light may be usable for undersea tasks to greater depths than was anticipated.
https://openalex.org/W2015729506,"IN experiments of short duration, the respiration of many micro-organisms is diminished only a little, if at all, by cyanide or by fluoride at concentrations which inhibit the main respiratory system of higher animals. I have used a strain of Chlorella vulgaris in which the respiration is insensitive to fluoride, cyanide and (in aerobic conditions) copper ions, but when suitable amounts of copper sulphate and sodium fluoride are added simultaneously to a cell suspension, oxygen uptake almost ceases. No similar effect has been seen when other metals are substituted for copper, or when most other anions are substituted for fluoride. Cyanide and iodide are exceptions, but both of these interact with cupric copper. The addition of citrate, to avoid possible precipitation of sparingly soluble basic copper fluoride, does not make copper sulphate or sodium fluoride more toxic when these are added to cells singly, nor does it reduce the inhibition of respiration which occurs when they are applied simultaneously (Fig. 1)."

I wish to point out that, in circumstances such as these, a choice can be made between alternative structures or details of structures by a method based on a statistical matching of a given sequence of amino-acids with the sequences of proteins of known tertiary structure3. This method has been refined (my unpublished work) so that for every amino-acid position along the chain which is analysed the probability of that amino-acid belonging to an α-helical segment can be calculated."
