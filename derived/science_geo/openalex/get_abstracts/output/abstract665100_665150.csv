https://openalex.org/W3111564425,"Governments are attempting to control the COVID-19 pandemic with nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). However, the effectiveness of different NPIs at reducing transmission is poorly understood. We gathered chronological data on the implementation of NPIs for several European and non-European countries between January and the end of May 2020. We estimated the effectiveness of these NPIs, which range from limiting gathering sizes and closing businesses or educational institutions to stay-at-home orders. To do so, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model that links NPI implementation dates to national case and death counts and supported the results with extensive empirical validation. Closing all educational institutions, limiting gatherings to 10 people or less, and closing face-to-face businesses each reduced transmission considerably. The additional effect of stay-at-home orders was comparatively small."

https://openalex.org/W3111302247,"Metastatic melanoma is hallmarked by its ability of phenotype switching to more slowly proliferating, but highly invasive cells. Here, we tested the impact of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) on melanoma progression in association with melanocyte inducing transcription factor (MITF) expression levels. We established a mouse melanoma model for deleting Stat3 in melanocytes with specific expression of human hyperactive NRASQ61K in an Ink4a-deficient background, two frequent driver mutations in human melanoma. Mice devoid of Stat3 showed early disease onset with higher proliferation in primary tumors, but displayed significantly diminished lung, brain, and liver metastases. Whole-genome expression profiling of tumor-derived cells also showed a reduced invasion phenotype, which was further corroborated by 3D melanoma model analysis. Notably, loss or knockdown of STAT3 in mouse or human cells resulted in the upregulation of MITF and induction of cell proliferation. Mechanistically we show that STAT3-induced CAAT Box Enhancer Binding Protein (CEBP) expression was sufficient to suppress MITF transcription. Epigenetic analysis by ATAC-seq confirmed that CEBPa/b binding to the MITF enhancer region silenced the MITF locus. Finally, by classification of patient-derived melanoma samples, we show that STAT3 and MITF act antagonistically and hence contribute differentially to melanoma progression. We conclude that STAT3 is a driver of the metastatic process in melanoma and able to antagonize MITF via direct induction of CEBP family member transcription."
https://openalex.org/W3110742776,"Dog training methods range broadly from those using mostly positive punishment and negative reinforcement (aversive-based) to those using primarily positive reinforcement (reward-based). Although aversive-based training has been strongly criticized for negatively affecting dog welfare, there is no comprehensive research focusing on companion dogs and mainstream techniques, and most studies rely on owner-reported assessment of training methods and dog behavior. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of aversive- and reward-based training methods on companion dog welfare within and outside the training context. Ninety-two companion dogs were recruited from three reward-based schools (Group Reward, n = 42), and from four aversive-based schools, two using low proportions of aversive-based methods (Group Mixed, n = 22) and two using high proportions of aversive-based methods (Group Aversive, n = 28). For evaluating welfare during training, dogs were video recorded for three sessions and six saliva samples were collected, three at home (baseline levels) and three after training (post-training levels). Video recordings were used to examine the frequency of stress-related behaviors (e.g., lip lick, yawn) and the overall behavioral state of the dog (e.g., tense, relaxed), and saliva samples were analyzed for cortisol concentration. For evaluating welfare outside the training context, dogs participated in a cognitive bias task. Results showed that dogs from Group Aversive displayed more stress-related behaviors, were more frequently in tense and low behavioral states and panted more during training, and exhibited higher post-training increases in cortisol levels than dogs from Group Reward. Additionally, dogs from Group Aversive were more ‘pessimistic’ in the cognitive bias task than dogs from Group Reward. Dogs from Group Mixed displayed more stress-related behaviors, were more frequently in tense states and panted more during training than dogs from Group Reward. Finally, although Groups Mixed and Aversive did not differ in their performance in the cognitive bias task nor in cortisol levels, the former displayed more stress-related behaviors and was more frequently in tense and low behavioral states. These findings indicate that aversive-based training methods, especially if used in high proportions, compromise the welfare of companion dogs both within and outside the training context."
https://openalex.org/W3113070411,"Expression of the androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) is frequently detected in castrate resistant prostate cancer and associated with resistance to AR-targeted therapies. While we have previously noted that homodimerization is required for the transcriptional activity of AR-V7 and that AR-V7 can also form heterodimers with the full-length AR (AR-FL), there are still many gaps of knowledge in AR-V7 stepwise activation. In the present study, we show that neither AR-V7 homodimerization nor AR-V7/AR-FL heterodimerization requires cofactors or DNA binding. AR-V7 can enter the nucleus as a monomer and drive a transcriptional program and DNA-damage repair as a homodimer. While forming a heterodimer with AR-FL to induce nuclear localization of unliganded AR-FL, AR-V7 does not need to interact with AR-FL to drive gene transcription or DNA-damage repair in prostate cancer cells that co-express AR-V7 and AR-FL. These data indicate that AR-V7 can function independently of its interaction with AR-FL in the true castrate state or “absence of ligand”, providing support for the utility of targeting AR-V7 in improving outcomes of patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3110733162,"Estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) mutations occur frequently in ER-positive metastatic breast cancer, and confer clinical resistance to aromatase inhibitors. Expression of the ESR1 Y537S mutation induced an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) with cells exhibiting enhanced migration and invasion potential in vitro. When small subpopulations of Y537S ESR1 mutant cells were injected along with WT parental cells, tumor growth was enhanced with mutant cells becoming the predominant population in distant metastases. Y537S mutant primary xenograft tumors were resistant to the antiestrogen tamoxifen (Tam) as well as to estradiol (E2) withdrawal. Y537S ESR1 mutant primary tumors metastasized efficiently in the absence of E2; however, Tam treatment significantly inhibited metastasis to distant sites. We identified a nine-gene expression signature, which predicted clinical outcomes of ER-positive breast cancer patients, as well as breast cancer metastasis to the lung. Androgen receptor (AR) protein levels were increased in mutant models, and the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone significantly inhibited estrogen-regulated gene expression, EMT, and distant metastasis in vivo, suggesting that AR may play a role in distant metastatic progression of ESR1 mutant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3112489438,"As older adults in an early stage (prefrailty) of frailty may return to a healthy state, it is necessary to examine the prevention of prefrailty. In this context, the number and types of social participation activities associated with physical prefrailty in community-dwelling older adults have remained relatively unexplored. This cross-sectional study investigates this issue by analyzing 616 participants living in Okinoshima, Shimane, a rural area of Japan, in 2019. Frailty was assessed using the 5-item frailty phenotype (unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity). Data on social participation were obtained using a questionnaire based on participants’ level of involvement with volunteer groups, sports clubs/groups, neighborhood associations, religious organizations/groups, and community elderly salons; their answers were categorized as “yes” if they answered “several times per year or more” and “no” if they answered “never.” Binominal logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of prefrailty by the number or types of social participation activities, adjusted for gender, age, body mass index, smoking, medication-taking, educational attainment, working status, and living arrangement. Of the 616 participants, 273 (44.3%) and 28 (4.5%) had prefrailty and frailty, respectively. The analysis showed that the number of social participation activities was significantly associated with lower odds of prefrailty (OR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.94). Regarding the types of social participation, sports clubs/groups were associated with lower odds of prefrailty (OR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31–0.73). Participation in neighborhood associations was associated with prefrailty/frailty (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37–0.86). These results suggest that increasing the number of social participation activities or involvement in sports clubs/groups and neighborhood associations may be important to prevent physical prefrailty in the older population."
https://openalex.org/W3115484227,"The mutagenic APOBEC3B (A3B) cytosine deaminase is frequently over-expressed in cancer and promotes tumour heterogeneity and therapy resistance. Hence, understanding the mechanisms that underlie A3B over-expression is important, especially for developing therapeutic approaches to reducing A3B levels, and consequently limiting cancer mutagenesis. We previously demonstrated that A3B is repressed by p53 and p53 mutation increases A3B expression. Here, we investigate A3B expression upon treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs that activate p53, including 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and cisplatin. Contrary to expectation, these drugs induced A3B expression and concomitant cellular cytosine deaminase activity. A3B induction was p53-independent, as chemotherapy drugs stimulated A3B expression in p53 mutant cells. These drugs commonly activate ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs. Using specific inhibitors and gene knockdowns, we show that activation of DNA-PKcs and ATM by chemotherapeutic drugs promotes NF-κB activity, with consequent recruitment of NF-κB to the A3B gene promoter to drive A3B expression. Further, we find that A3B knockdown re-sensitises resistant cells to cisplatin, and A3B knockout enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. Our data highlight a role for A3B in resistance to chemotherapy and indicate that stimulation of A3B expression by activation of DNA repair and NF-κB pathways could promote cancer mutations and expedite chemoresistance."
https://openalex.org/W3116797741,"Abstract Colorectal tumors are hierarchically organized and governed by populations of self-renewing cancer stem cells, representing one of the deadliest types of cancers worldwide. Emergence of cancer stemness phenotype depends on epigenetic reprogramming, associated with profound transcriptional changes. As described for pluripotent reprogramming, epigenetic modifiers play a key role in cancer stem cells by establishing embryonic stem-like transcriptional programs, thus impacting the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. We identified overexpression of histone methyltransferase G9a as a risk factor for colorectal cancer, associated with shorter relapse-free survival. Moreover, using human transformed pluripotent cells as a surrogate model for cancer stem cells, we observed that G9a activity is essential for the maintenance of embryonic-like transcriptional signature promoting self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and undifferentiated state. Such a role was also applicable to colorectal cancer, where inhibitors of G9a histone methyltransferase function induced intestinal differentiation while restricting tumor-initiating activity in patient-derived colorectal tumor samples. Finally, by integrating transcriptome profiling with G9a/H3K9me2 loci co-occupancy, we identified the canonical Wnt pathway, epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition, and extracellular matrix organization as potential targets of such a chromatin regulation mechanism in colorectal cancer stem cells. Overall, our findings provide novel insights on the role of G9a as a driver of cancer stem cell phenotype, promoting self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and undifferentiated state."
https://openalex.org/W3111302765,"Background The optimal treatment for patients with severe coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) and hyper-inflammation remains debated. Material and methods A cohort study was designed to evaluate whether a therapeutic algorithm using steroids with or without interleukin-1 antagonist (anakinra) could prevent death/invasive ventilation. Patients with a ≥5-day evolution since symptoms onset, with hyper-inflammation (CRP≥50mg/L), requiring 3–5 L/min oxygen, received methylprednisolone alone. Patients needing ≥6 L/min received methylprednisolone + subcutaneous anakinra daily either frontline or in case clinical deterioration upon corticosteroids alone. Death rate and death or intensive care unit (ICU) invasive ventilation rate at Day 15, with Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% CIs, were determined according to logistic regression and propensity scores. A Bayesian analysis estimated the treatment effects. Results Of 108 consecutive patients, 70 patients received glucocorticoids alone. The control group comprised 63 patients receiving standard of care. In the corticosteroid±stanakinra group (n = 108), death rate was 20.4%, versus 30.2% in the controls, indicating a 30% relative decrease in death risk and a number of 10 patients to treat to avoid a death (p = 0.15). Using propensity scores a per-protocol analysis showed an OR for COVID-19-related death of 0.9 (95%CI [0.80–1.01], p = 0.067). On Bayesian analysis, the posterior probability of any mortality benefit with corticosteroids+/-anakinra was 87.5%, with a 7.8% probability of treatment-related harm. Pre-existing diabetes exacerbation occurred in 29 of 108 patients (26.9%). Conclusion In COVID-19 non-ICU inpatients at the cytokine release phase, corticosteroids with or without anakinra were associated with a 30% decrease of death risk on Day 15."
https://openalex.org/W3112543662,"Introduction There is emerging evidence that food industry involvement in nutrition research may bias research findings and/or research agendas. However, the extent of food industry involvement in nutrition research has not been systematically explored. This study aimed to identify the extent of food industry involvement in peer-reviewed articles from a sample of leading nutrition-related journals, and to examine the extent to which findings from research involving the food industry support industry interests. Methods All original research articles published in 2018 in the top 10 most-cited nutrition- and dietetics-related journals were analysed. We evaluated the proportion of articles that disclosed involvement from the food industry, including through author affiliations, funding sources, declarations of interest or other acknowledgments. Principal research findings from articles with food industry involvement, and a random sample of articles without food industry involvement, were categorised according to the extent to which they supported relevant food industry interests. Results 196/1,461 (13.4%) articles reported food industry involvement. The extent of food industry involvement varied by journal, with The Journal of Nutrition (28.3%) having the highest and Paediatric Obesity (3.8%) having the lowest proportion of industry involvement. Processed food manufacturers were involved in the most articles (77/196, 39.3%). Of articles with food industry involvement, 55.6% reported findings favourable to relevant food industry interests, compared to 9.7% of articles without food industry involvement. Conclusion Food industry involvement in peer-reviewed research in leading nutrition-related journals is commonplace. In line with previous literature, this study has shown that a greater proportion of peer-reviewed studies involving the food industry have results that favour relevant food industry interests than peer-reviewed studies without food industry involvement. Given the potential competing interests of the food industry, it is important to explore mechanisms that can safeguard the integrity and public relevance of nutrition research."
https://openalex.org/W3112565449,"Because more than 80% of species of gamete-spawning corals, including most Acroporidae species, do not inherit Symbiodiniaceae from their parents, they must acquire symbiont cells from sources in their environment. To determine whether photosynthetically competent Symbiodiniaceae expelled as fecal pellets from giant clams are capable of colonizing corals, we conducted laboratory experiments in which planula larvae of Acropora tenuis were inoculated with the cells in fecal pellets obtained from Tridacna crocea . T . crocea fecal pellets were administered once a day, and three days later, cells of Symbiodiniaceae from the fecal pellets had been taken up by the coral larvae. T . crocea fecal pellets were not supplied from the 4 th day until the 8 th day, and the cell densities in the larvae increased until the 8 th day, which indicated the successful colonization by Symbiodiniaceae. The control group exhibited the highest mean percentage of larvae (100%) that were successfully colonized by culture strains of Symbiodiniaceae, and larvae inoculated with fecal pellets reached a colonization percentage of 66.7 ~ 96.7% on the 8 th day. The highest colonization rate was achieved with the fecal pellets containing cells with high photosynthetic competency ( Fv/Fm ). Interestingly, the genetic composition of Symbiodiniaceae in the larvae retrieved on the 8 th day differed from that in the fecal pellets and showed exclusive domination of the genus Symbiodinium . A minor but significant population of the genus Cladocopium in the fecal pellets was not inherited by the larvae. These experiments provided the first demonstration that the Symbiodiniaceae from tridacnine clams provided via fecal pellets can colonize and even proliferate in coral larvae."

In this paper, we elaborate on our traffic prediction application, which is based on traffic data collected through Google Map API. Our application is a desktop-based application that predicts traffic congestion state using Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). In addition to ETA, the prediction system takes into account various features such as weather, time period, special conditions, holidays, etc. The label of the classifier is identified as one of the five traffic states i.e. smooth, slightly congested, congested, highly congested or blockage. The results demonstrate that the random forest classification algorithm has the highest prediction accuracy of 92 percent followed by XGBoost and KNN respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3115105912,"Cancer cell expression of PD-L1 leads to T cells exhaustion by transducing co-inhibitory signal, and further understanding the regulation of PD-L1 in cancer cells may provide additional therapeutic strategies. Here by drug repurposing screen, we identified amlodipine as a potent inhibitor of PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. Further survey of calcium-associated pathways revealed calpain-dependent stabilization of the PD-L1 protein. Intracellular calcium delivered an operational signal to calpain-dependent Beclin-1 cleavage, blocking autophagic degradation of PD-L1 accumulated on recycling endosome (RE). Blocking calcium flux by amlodipine depleted PD-L1 expression and increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration in tumor tissues but not in myocardium, causing dose-dependent tumor suppression in vivo. Rescuing PD-L1 expression eliminated the effects of amlodipine, suggesting the PD-L1-dependent effect of amlodipine. These results reveal a calcium-dependent mechanism controlling PD-L1 degradation, and highlight calcium flux blockade as a potential strategy for combinatorial immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3112925726,"Previous analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from human naive pluripotent stem cells reported multiple point “mutations” in cancer-related genes and implicated selective culture conditions. We observed, however, that those mutations were only present in co-cultures with mouse feeder cells.

After we filtered reads to remove sequences of mouse origin, the actual incidence of oncogenic polymorphisms arising in naive pluripotent stem cells is close to zero."
https://openalex.org/W3111762152,"The widespread accessibility and use of the internet provides numerous opportunities for women to independently seek out pregnancy-related information and social and emotional support during the antenatal period. Given the heightened psychological vulnerability of the pregnancy period there is a critical need to examine digital media use within the context of the feelings that women have about themselves and towards their fetus. The current study examined the relationship between digital media use during pregnancy, psychological wellbeing and their maternal-fetal attachment using an online survey. Forty-eight pregnant women completed a self-report questionnaire on their reasons for using digital media, and standardised measures of self-criticism, negative affect, social quality of life (QOL), and maternal-fetal attachment. The mean age of participants was 29.4 years ( SD = 5.26), with a mean of 24.3 weeks gestation ( SD = 9.95). Information seeking, emotional support and social support were highly endorsed reasons for digital media use (85.42%, 66.67%, 62.5% respectively). However, digital media use was positively correlated with negative affect ( p = .003) and self-criticism ( p &lt; .001). Digital media use was also negatively correlated with QOL ( p = .007). There was no evidence of a relationship between digital media use and maternal-fetal attachment ( p = .330). Digital environments may be an important social context within which a pregnant woman develops her own maternal identity and knowledge. There are a number of benefits and limitations of this medium for providing information and support for women during pregnancy. Enhancing the opportunities to promote pregnant women’s wellbeing in this context is an important avenue for further research and practice."
https://openalex.org/W3116103776,"Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality in men. The major cause of death in prostate cancer patients can be attributed to metastatic spread of disease or tumor recurrence after initial treatment. Prostate tumors are known to remain undetected or dormant for a long period of time before they progress locoregionally or at distant sites as overt tumors. However, the molecular mechanism of dormancy is yet poorly understood. In this study, we performed a differential gene expression analysis and identified a gene, Regucalcin (RGN), which promotes dormancy of prostate cancer. We found that cancer patients expressing higher level of RGN showed significantly longer recurrence-free and overall- survival. Using a doxycycline-inducible RGN expression system, we showed that ectopic expression of RGN in prostate tumor cells induced dormancy in vivo, while following suppression of RGN triggered recurrence of tumor growth. On the other hand, silencing RGN in LNCap cells promoted its outgrowth in the tibia of mice. Importantly, RGN promoted multiple known hallmarks of tumor dormancy including activation of p38 MAPK, decrease in Erk signaling and inhibition of FOXM1 expression. Furthermore, we found that RGN significantly suppressed angiogenesis by increasing secretory miR-23c level in the exosomes. Intriguingly, FOXM1 was found to negatively regulate miR-23c expression in prostate cancer. In addition, we identified 11 RGN downstream target genes that independently predicted longer recurrence-free survival in patients. We found that expression of these genes was regulated by FOXM1 and/or p38 MAPK. These findings suggest a critical role of RGN in prostate cancer dormancy, and the utility of RGN signaling and exosomal miR-23c as biomarkers for predicting recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W3108465772,"The huge power for social influence of digital media may come with the risk of intensifying common societal biases, such as gender and age stereotypes. Speaker’s gender and age also behaviorally manifest in language use, and language may be a powerful tool to shape impact. The present study took the example of TED, a highly successful knowledge dissemination platform, to study online influence. Our goal was to investigate how gender- and age-linked language styles–beyond chronological age and identified gender–link to talk impact and whether this reflects gender and age stereotypes. In a pre-registered study, we collected transcripts of TED Talks along with their impact measures, i.e., views and ratios of positive and negative talk ratings, from the TED website. We scored TED Speakers’ ( N = 1,095) language with gender- and age-morphed language metrics to obtain measures of female versus male, and younger versus more senior language styles. Contrary to our expectations and to the literature on gender stereotypes, more female language was linked to higher impact in terms of quantity, i.e., more talk views, and this was particularly the case among talks with a lot of views. Regarding quality of impact, language signatures of gender and age predicted different types of positive and negative ratings above and beyond main effects of speaker’s gender and age. The differences in ratings seem to reflect common stereotype contents of warmth (e.g., “beautiful” for female, “courageous” for female and senior language) versus competence (e.g., “ingenious”, “informative” for male language). The results shed light on how verbal behavior may contribute to stereotypical evaluations. They also illuminate how, within new digital social contexts, female language might be uniquely rewarded and, thereby, an underappreciated but highly effective tool for social influence.

Dual PPAR α/δ agonist, such as GFT505 (also known as elafibranor), demonstrated potential therapeutic effect for NASH in clinical trials. To profile the regulatory network of PPAR α/δ agonist in NASH, the choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) induced NASH model was used to test the pharmacodynamics and transcriptome regulation of GFT505 in this study. The results showed that GFT505 ameliorated hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in CDAHFD mice model. RNA-sequencing yielded 3995 up-regulated and 3576 down-regulated genes with GFT505 treatment. And the most significant differentialy expressed genes involved in glucolipid metabolism ( Pparα , Acox1 , Cpt1b , Fabp4 , Ehhadh , Fabp3 ), inflammation ( Ccl6 , Ccl9 , Cxcl14 ) and fibrosis ( Timp1 , Lamc3 , Timp2 , Col3a1 , Col1a2 , Col1a1 , Hapln4 , Timp3 , Pik3r5 , Pdgfα , Pdgfβ , Tgfβ1 , Tgfβ2 ) were confirmed by RT-qPCR. The down-regulated genes were enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathway, while the up-regulated genes were enriched in PPAR signaling pathway and fatty acid degradation pathway. This study provides clues and basis for further understanding on the mechanism of PPAR α/δ agonist on NASH."
https://openalex.org/W3113024575,"Background The risk of death from complications relating to pregnancy and childbirth for women’s lifetime is higher in developing countries. Improving maternal and child health through a well-organized institutional delivery service is central to achieving reduced maternal and child mortality. Despite the efforts that have been made to improve maternal health outcomes in Ethiopia, institutional delivery is still unacceptably low. Objective This study was conducted to assess institutional delivery service utilization and associated factors in the study area. Methods A Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to employ a total of 546 women. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and entered into EpiData version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS version 23.0. for analysis. Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with the outcome variable. Adjusted Odds ratios with 95% CI were computed to measure the strength of association and statistical significance was declared at p-value &lt;0.05. Results The Prevalence of institutional delivery in the study area was 38% (34%-42%). Factors significantly associated with institutional delivery were ANC visit 1.80 (1.12–2.91), knowledge of danger sign during pregnancy 3.60 (2.25–5.76), urban residency 2.09 (1.15–3.81), Parity 0.49 (0.25–0.95) accessibility of health facility 4.60 (2.01–10.89), husbands educational level: primary 2.50 (1.27–4.91), secondary and above 2.36 (1.24–4.48), mothers occupation: governmental employee 2.05 (1.00–4.18), and Private employee 2.42 (1.09–5.35). Conclusions The prevalence of institutional delivery in the District was low. Antenatal visits, residency, knowledge of pregnancy danger signs, parity, and accessibility of health facilities, maternal occupation, and husband education were factors significantly associated with institutional delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3112296368,"Clinical studies using a range of omega-3 supplements have yielded conflicting results on their efficacy to control inflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids are substrate for the formation of potent immune-protective mediators, termed as specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM). Herein, we investigated whether observed differences in the potencies of distinct omega-3 supplements were linked with their ability to upregulate SPM formation. Using lipid mediator profiling we found that four commercially available supplements conferred a unique SPM signature profile to human macrophages, with the overall increases in SPM concentrations being different between the four supplements. These increases in SPM concentrations were linked with an upregulation of macrophage phagocytosis and a decreased uptake of oxidized low-density lipoproteins. Pharmacological inhibition of two key SPM biosynthetic enzymes 5-Lipoxygenase or 15-Lipoxygenase reversed the macrophage-directed actions of each of the omega-3 supplements. Furthermore, administration of the two supplements that most potently upregulated macrophage SPM formation and reprogrammed their responses in vitro , to APOE -/- mice fed a western diet, increased plasma SPM concentrations and reduced vascular inflammation. Together these findings support the utility of SPM as potential prognostic markers in determining the utility of a given supplement to regulate macrophage responses and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3112761598,"Current facemask research focuses on material characterization and efficiency; however, facemasks are often not tested such that aerosol distributions are evaluated from the gaps in the sides, bottom, and nose areas. Poor evaluation methods could lead to misinformation on optimal facemasks use; a high-throughput, reproducible method which illuminates the issue of fit influencing aerosol transmission is needed. To this end, we have created an in vitro model to quantify particle transmission by mimicking exhalation aerosols in a 3D printed face-nose-mouth replica via a nebulizer and quantifying particle counts using a hand-held particle counter. A sewn, sewn with pipe cleaner nose piece, and sewn with a coffee filter facemask were used to evaluate current common homemade sewn facemask designs, benchmarked against industry standard surgical, N95 respirator tightly fit, and N95 respirator loosely fit facemasks. All facemasks have significantly reduced particle counts in front of the facemask, but the side and top of the facemask showed increases in particle counts over the no facemask condition at that same position, suggesting that some proportion of aerosols are being redirected to these gaps. An altered size distribution of aerosols that escape at the vulnerable positions was observed; escaped particles have larger count median diameters, with a decreased ratio of smaller to larger particles, possibly due to hygroscopic growth or aggregation. Of the homemade sewn facemasks, the facemask with a coffee filter insert performed the best at reducing escaped aerosols, with increased efficiency also observed for sewn masks with a pipe cleaner nose piece. Importantly, there were minimal differences between facemasks at increasing distances, which supports that social distance is a critical element in reducing aerosol transmission. This work brings to light the importance of quantifying particle count in positions other than directly in front of the facemask and identifies areas of research to be explored."

https://openalex.org/W3110752039,"Automated quantification of behavior is increasingly prevalent in neuroscience research. Human judgments can influence machine-learning-based behavior classification at multiple steps in the process, for both supervised and unsupervised approaches. Such steps include the design of the algorithm for machine learning, the methods used for animal tracking, the choice of training images, and the benchmarking of classification outcomes. However, how these design choices contribute to the interpretation of automated behavioral classifications has not been extensively characterized. Here, we quantify the effects of experimenter choices on the outputs of automated classifiers of Drosophila social behaviors. Drosophila behaviors contain a considerable degree of variability, which was reflected in the confidence levels associated with both human and computer classifications. We found that a diversity of sex combinations and tracking features was important for robust performance of the automated classifiers. In particular, features concerning the relative position of flies contained useful information for training a machine-learning algorithm. These observations shed light on the importance of human influence on tracking algorithms, the selection of training images, and the quality of annotated sample images used to benchmark the performance of a classifier (the ‘ground truth’). Evaluation of these factors is necessary for researchers to accurately interpret behavioral data quantified by a machine-learning algorithm and to further improve automated classifications."

The aim of this study was to characterize the αβ and γδ T cell subsets in peripheral blood of patients with CC matched with healthy volunteers. In this prospective case-control study, blood samples were obtained from 96 patients with newly diagnosed treatment-naïve infiltrating colonic adenocarcinoma and 48 healthy volunteers. Pathological report at surgery was obtained from all CC patients. A significant decrease in CD3+ γδ T cells and CD3+CD8+ γδ T cells (p&lt;0.001) were observed in CC patients. Apoptosis was significantly increased in all conventional and both αβ and γδ T cell subsets in patients with CC vs healthy subjects. γδ T cells were decreased in peripheral blood of patients with microscopic infiltration in tissues, history of cancer and synchronous colon cancer (p &lt; 0.05). IFN-γ was significantly reduced in CC patients compared to controls. Cytotoxic effector γδ T cells TEMRA (CD8 and CD56) are the proportionally most abundant T cells in peripheral blood of CC patients. Patients with CC present a deep downregulation in the systemic T-cell immunity. These variations are evident through all tumor stages and suggest that a deficiency in γδ T cell populations could be preventing control of tumor progression. This fact prove the role of immunomodulation on CC carcinogenesis."

The current study was designed as an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify transgenerational sperm disease associated differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) and differential histone retention regions (DHRs). Gestating female F0 generation rats were transiently exposed to atrazine during the period of embryonic gonadal sex determination, and then subsequent F1, F2, and F3 generations obtained in the absence of any continued exposure. The transgenerational F3 generation males were assessed for disease and sperm collected for epigenetic analysis. Pathology was observed in pubertal onset and for testis disease, prostate disease, kidney disease, lean pathology, and multiple disease. For these pathologies, sufficient numbers of individual males with only a single specific disease were identified. The sperm DNA and chromatin were isolated from adult one-year animals with the specific diseases and analyzed for DMRs with methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) sequencing and DHRs with histone chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing. Transgenerational F3 generation males with or without disease were compared to identify the disease specific epimutation biomarkers. All pathologies were found to have disease specific DMRs and DHRs which were found to predominantly be distinct for each disease. No common DMRs or DHRs were found among all the pathologies. Epimutation gene associations were identified and found to correlate to previously known disease linked genes. This is one of the first observations of potential sperm disease biomarkers for histone retention sites. Although further studies with expanded animal numbers are required, the current study provides evidence the EWAS analysis is effective for the identification of potential pathology epimutation biomarkers for disease susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W3112106534,"Aim This study explores the association between Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) scores and dental pathology such as missing teeth, the (peri-apical) health status and restoration grade of the teeth, and the grade of alveolar bone loss seen on a dental panoramic radiograph (Orthopantomograph–OPG). Materials and methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, data was collected from three hospitals spread in the Netherlands. Patients were included when a CAC score and an OPG were available, both recorded within a maximum period of 365 days from 2009–2017. The CAC score was measured on a CT scan, using the Agatston method. To assess dental pathology, the number of missing teeth, the number of dental implants, alveolar bone loss, caries, endodontic treatments, peri-apical radiolucencies, bone loss at implants, impacted teeth and dental cysts, were determined on the OPG. All observers were calibrated. The electronic health records provided information about: gender, age, smoking, Diabetes Mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and Body Mass Index (BMI). Results 212 patients were included. We found a statistically significant association between the number of missing teeth and the CAC score. When modeling age, sex, and other well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the significant correlation was no longer present after multivariate correction. Furthermore, the results showed a trend for more teeth with peri-apical lesions and a higher percentage of mean alveolar bone loss in the group with the highest CAC scores. Conclusion This study showed that being edentulous or missing teeth is correlated to higher CAC scores however failed to be an independent predictor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. The number of (missing) teeth is an easily accessible marker and could be used as a marker for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) risk by almost any healthcare worker. The current study needs to be considered as an explorative pilot study and could contribute to the design of further (prospective) studies on the relationship between dental pathology and coronary artery calcification by adding clinical information and extra cardiovascular biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W3112702786,"Chronic inflammation promotes prostate cancer (PCa) initiation and progression. We previously reported that acute intereluekin-1 (IL-1) exposure represses androgen receptor (AR) accumulation and activity, providing a possible mechanism for IL-1-mediated development of androgen- and AR-independent PCa. Given that acute inflammation is quickly resolved, and chronic inflammation is, instead, co-opted by cancer cells to promote tumorigenicity, we set out to determine if chronic IL-1 exposure leads to similar repression of AR and AR activity observed for acute IL-1 exposure and to determine if chronic IL-1 exposure selects for androgen- and AR-independent PCa cells. We generated isogenic sublines from LNCaP cells chronically exposed to IL-1α or IL-1β. Cells were treated with IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα or HS-5 bone marrow stromal cells conditioned medium to assess cell viability in the presence of cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines. Cell viability was also assessed following serum starvation, AR siRNA silencing and enzalutamide treatment. Finally, RNA sequencing was performed for the IL-1 sublines. MTT, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis show that the sublines evolved resistance to inflammation-induced cytotoxicity and intracellular signaling and evolved reduced sensitivity to siRNA-mediated loss of AR , serum deprivation and enzalutamide. Differential gene expression reveals that canonical AR signaling is aberrant in the IL-1 sublines, where the cells show constitutive PSA repression and basally high KLK2 and NKX3 . 1 mRNA levels and bioinformatics analysis predicts that pro-survival and pro-tumorigenic pathways are activated in the sublines. Our data provide evidence that chronic IL-1 exposure promotes PCa cell androgen and AR independence and, thus, supports CRPCa development."
https://openalex.org/W3110716131,"Inactivation of Pten gene through deletions and mutations leading to excessive pro-growth signaling pathway activations frequently occurs in cancers. Here, we report a Pten derived pro-cancer growth gene fusion Pten-NOLC1 originated from a chr10 genome rearrangement and identified through a transcriptome sequencing analysis of human cancers. Pten-NOLC1 fusion is present in primary human cancer samples and cancer cell lines from different organs. The product of Pten-NOLC1 is a nuclear protein that interacts and activates promoters of EGFR, c-MET, and their signaling molecules. Pten-NOLC1 promotes cancer proliferation, growth, invasion, and metastasis, and reduces the survival of animals xenografted with Pten-NOLC1-expressing cancer cells. Genomic disruption of Pten-NOLC1 induces cancer cell death, while genomic integration of this fusion gene into the liver coupled with somatic Pten deletion produces spontaneous liver cancers in mice. Our studies indicate that Pten-NOLC1 gene fusion is a driver for human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3111813526,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic disease that involves long-term inflammation of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Bacterial biofilms present on the sinus mucosa of certain patients reportedly exhibit resistance against traditional antibiotics, as evidenced by relapse, resulting in severe disease. The aim of this study was to determine the killing activity of human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides (LL-37, LL-31) and their D-enantiomers (D-LL-37, D-LL-31), alone and in combination with conventional antibiotics (amoxicillin; AMX and tobramycin; TOB), against bacteria grown as biofilm, and to investigate the biological activities of the peptides on human lung epithelial cells. D-LL-31 was the most effective peptide against bacteria under biofilm-stimulating conditions based on IC 50 values. The synergistic effect of D-LL-31 with AMX and TOB decreased the IC 50 values of antibiotics by 16-fold and could eliminate the biofilm matrix in all tested bacterial strains. D-LL-31 did not cause cytotoxic effects in A549 cells at 25 μM after 24 h of incubation. Moreover, a cytokine array indicated that there was no significant induction of the cytokines involving in immunopathogenesis of CRS in the presence of D-LL-31. However, a tissue-remodeling-associated protein was observed that may prevent the progression of nasal polyposis in CRS patients. Therefore, a combination of D-LL-31 with AMX or TOB may improve the efficacy of currently used antibiotics to kill biofilm-embedded bacteria and eliminate the biofilm matrix. This combination might be clinically applicable for treatment of patients with biofilm-associated CRS."

However, little research has been conducted to investigate their integration, namely, game-based self-regulated language learning (GBSRLL). This study aims to conceptualise GBSRLL based on the combination of theoretical analysis, thematic evolution analysis, and social network analysis on the research articles in the fields of game-based language learning and self-regulated language learning. The results show that GBSRLL is a new interdisciplinary field emerging since the period from 2018 to 2019. Self-regulated learning strategies that can be performed in GBSRLL, the effects of GBSRLL on learners’ affective states, and the features in GBSRLL were the prominent research topics in this field. Its theoretical foundation centres on the positive correlations between learner motivation, self-efficacy, and autonomy and the implementation of game-based learning and self-regulated learning. It is feasible to conduct GBSRLL due to the strong supportiveness of game mechanics for various phases and strategies of self-regulated learning. More contributions to this new interdisciplinary field are called for, especially from the aspects of the long-term effects of GBSRLL on academic performance and the useful tools and technologies for implementing GBSRLL."
https://openalex.org/W3112963212,"Thailand has the highest road traffic fatality rate in Southeast Asia, making road safety a critical public health concern. A 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) Report showed that speeding behavior was the most important determinant for road traffic crashes in Thailand. Here, we aimed to examine associations of socio-demographic factors (gender, age, socioeconomic status) with self-reported motorcycle speeding behavior. Additionally, we examined a potential role of time discounting and risk preference as mediators in the association of socio-demographic factors with speeding. We used data obtained from the Mahasarakham University Social Network Survey 2018 (MSUSSS) (N = 150). We ran linear network autocorrelation models (lnam) to account for the data's social network structure. We found that males are more likely than females to engage in speeding behavior (β = 0.140, p = 0.001) and to discount the future (β = 5.175, p = 0.017). However, further causal mediation analysis showed that time discounting does not mediate the gender-speeding association (p for mediation = 0.540). Although socioeconomic status (subjective social class) was not associated with speeding (β = 0.039, p = 0.177), age was marginally associated with speeding (β = 0.005, p = 0.093). Future studies may consider using a larger sample."
https://openalex.org/W3111470194,"Low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) concentrations are a standard of care in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and are influenced by different factors. This study compared the LDL-C concentrations estimated by two different equations and determined their associations with inflammatory status, oxidative stress, anthropometric variables, food intake and DNA methylation levels in the LPL , ADRB3 and MTHFR genes. A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted with 236 adults (median age 37.5 years) of both sexes from the municipality of João Pessoa, Paraíba, Brazil. The LDL-C concentrations were estimated according to the Friedewald and Martin equations. LPL , ADRB3 and MTHFR gene methylation levels; malondialdehyde levels; total antioxidant capacity; ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, homocysteine, cobalamin, and folic acid levels; usual dietary intake; and epidemiological variables were also determined. For each unit increase in malondialdehyde concentration there was an increase in the LDL-C concentration from 6.25 to 10.29 mg/dL (p &lt;0.000). Based on the Martin equation (≥70 mg/dL), there was a decrease in the DNA methylation levels in the ADRB3 gene and an increase in the DNA methylation levels in the MTHFR gene (p &lt;0.05). There was a positive relation of homocysteine and cholesterol intake on LDL-C concentrations estimated according to the Friedewald equation and of waist circumference and age based on the two estimates. It is concluded the LDL-C concentrations estimated by the Friedewald and Martin equations were different, and the Friedewald equation values were significantly lower than those obtained by the Martin equation. MDA was the variable that was most positively associated with the estimated LDL-C levels in all multivariate models. Significant relationships were observed based on the two estimates and occurred for most variables. The methylation levels of the ADRB3 and MTHFR genes were different according to the Martin equation at low LDL-C concentrations (70 mg/dL)."
https://openalex.org/W3112537900,"Background The Guarani-Kaiowá are Brazil's second-largest indigenous group. Average annual tuberculosis (TB) incidence rates among the Guarani-Kaiowá are nearly 400/100,000 in Mato Grosso do Sul state, ten times the national average. Although stigma is considered crucial for TB control in indigenous communities, few studies have investigated TB stigma among indigenous populations. This study sought to understand the role of TB-related stigma and perceptions of TB in maintaining hyperendemic TB transmission in the Guarani-Kaiowá communities. Methods Various forms of stigma were explored through semi-structured interviews with 19 patients, 11 relatives, and 23 community members. Patients were identified from the registry of the healthcare service. Community members, selected by snowball sampling, were matched by gender and village of residence. Interviews were conducted in Guarani and Portuguese and later translated into English. Framework analysis was performed using NVivo. Results Traditional beliefs of a weakening of the body allowing the disease to enter were common, but the exact mechanism of transmission was unknown. Strong community/public stigma associated TB with uncleanliness, abuse, and irresponsibility. Anticipated stigma led to significant treatment delays for fear of exclusion and losing employment. While most patients felt supported by their families, nearly all patients related experienced/enacted stigma in the community such as gossip, avoidance, and social exclusion, leading to long-lasting internalized/self-stigma. Secondary stigmatization of relatives was widespread, and blanket latent TB infection (LTBI) treatment of patients’ households was a contributing factor in treatment delay. The healthcare service unnecessarily added to stigmatization by enforcing separate utensils and sleeping arrangements for patients. Conclusions Our findings suggest that stigma is a driver for treatment delay and continued transmission of TB in the community. The stigmatization of TB was rooted in a poor understanding of TB transmission, partly because of incorrect orientation by the healthcare service. Interventions to reduce TB-associated stigma are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W3112969224,"It has been widely accepted that moral violations that involve impurity (such as spitting in public) induce the emotion of disgust, but there has been a debate about whether moral violations that do not involve impurity (such as swearing in public) also induce the same emotion. The answer to this question may have implication for understanding where morality comes from and how people make moral judgments. This study aimed to compared the neural mechanisms underlying two kinds of moral violation by using an affective priming task to test the effect of sentences depicting moral violation behaviors with and without physical impurity on subsequent detection of disgusted faces in a visual search task. After reading each sentence, participants completed the face search task. Behavioral and electrophysiological (event-related potential, or ERP) indices of affective priming (P2, N400, LPP) and attention allocation (N2pc) were analyzed. Results of behavioral data and ERP data showed that moral violations both with and without impurity promoted the detection of disgusted faces (RT, N2pc); moral violations without impurity impeded the detection of neutral faces (N400). No priming effect was found on P2 and LPP. The results suggest both types of moral violation influenced the processing of disgusted faces and neutral faces, but the neural activity with temporal characteristics was different."

We discuss the mean-income population share ( MPS ), the population percentage of earners below mean income, whose evolution can capture how representative rising mean values are for middle income households. Tracking MPS and its associated income share MIS over time indicates to what extent economic growth is inclusive of both the middle and the bottom of the income distribution. We characterize MPS and MIS analytically under different growth scenarios and compare their parametric estimation using micro-level and grouped income data. Our empirical application with panel data of 16 high- and middle-income countries shows that in the last decades rising mean incomes have mostly not favored middle income households in relative perspective, while the overall welfare effects of the changes in MPS and the correlation structure with the Gini coefficient are mixed."
https://openalex.org/W3111532655,"Excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor associated with colorectal cancer; however, some epidemiological studies have reported that moderate alcohol consumption may not contribute additional risk or may provide a protective effect reducing colorectal cancer risk. Prior research highlights the importance of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis as parameters to consider when evaluating colonic cell growth and tumorigenesis. The present study investigated whether chronic low-to-moderate ethanol consumption altered these parameters of colonic cell growth and expression of related genes. Twenty-four nondeprived young adult (109 days old) and 24 nondeprived middle-aged (420 days old) Wistar rats were randomly assigned to an ethanol-exposed or a water control group ( n = 12/group). The ethanol group was provided voluntary access to a 20% v/v ethanol solution on alternate days for 13 weeks. Colon tissues were collected for quantitative immunohistochemical analyses of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis using Ki-67, goblet cell and TUNEL, respectively. Gene expression of cyclin D1 ( Ccnd1 ), Cdk2 , Cdk4 , p21 waf1/cip1 ( Cdkn1a ), E-cadherin ( Cdh1 ) and p53 were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in colonic scraped mucosa. Ethanol treatment resulted in a lower cell proliferation index and proliferative zone, and lower Cdk2 expression in both age groups, as well as trends toward lower Ccnd1 and higher Cdkn1a expression. Cell differentiation was modestly but significantly reduced by ethanol treatment only in older animals. Overall, older rats showed decreases in apoptosis and gene expression of Cdk4 , Cdh1 , and p53 compared to younger rats, but there was no observed effect of ethanol exposure on these measures. These findings suggest that low-to-moderate ethanol consumption improves at least one notable parameter in colonic tumorigenesis (cell proliferation) and associated gene expression regardless of age, however, selectively decreased cell differentiation among older subjects."
https://openalex.org/W3113256884,"Body-worn video is increasingly relied upon in the criminal justice system, however it is unclear how viewing chest-mounted video may affect a police officer’s statement about an event. In the present study, we asked whether reviewing footage from an experienced event could shape an individual’s statement, and if so, whether reporting before reviewing may preserve an officer’s original experience. Student participants ( n = 97) were equipped with chest-mounted cameras as they viewed a simulated theft in virtual reality. One week later, half of the participants recalled the event in an initial statement while the other half did not. Participants then viewed either their body-worn video or a control video. Finally, participants provided their statement (no initial statement condition) or were given the opportunity to amend their original account (initial statement condition). Results revealed that viewing body-worn video enhanced the completeness and accuracy of individuals’ free recall statements. However, whilst reviewing footage enabled individuals to exclude errors they had written in their initial statements, they also excluded true details that were uncorroborated by the camera footage (i.e., details which individuals experienced, but that their camera did not record). Such camera conformity is discussed in light of the debate on when an officer should access their body-worn video during an investigation and the influence of post-event information on memory."

This study was aimed to catalogue LIPC variants by resequencing the entire LIPC gene in 95 non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) and 95 African blacks (ABs) with extreme HDL-C levels followed by in silico functional analyses. A total of 412 variants, including 43 novel variants were identified; 56 were unique to NHWs and 234 were unique to ABs. Seventy-eight variants in NHWs and 89 variants in ABs were present either in high HDL-C group or low HDL-C group. Two non-synonymous variants (p.S289F, p.T405M), found in NHWs with high HDL-C group were predicted to have damaging effect on LIPC protein by SIFT, MT2 and PP2. We also found several non-coding variants that possibly reside in the circRNA and lncRNA binding sites and may have regulatory potential, as identified in rSNPbase and RegulomeDB databases. Our results shed light on the regulatory nature of rare and non-coding LIPC variants as well as suggest their important contributions in affecting the extreme HDL-C phenotypes."

End-effector gait robots (EEGRs) can blend these effects with stereotyped movement-induced neuroplasticity. The authors aimed to evaluate the usefulness of EEGRs as a postoperative neuro-muscular rehabilitation tool. This prospective randomized controlled trial included patients who had undergone unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: one using a 200-step rehabilitation program in an EEGR or the other using a walker on a floor (WF) three times a day for five weekdays. The two groups were compared by electrophysiological and biomechanical methods. Since there were no more enrollments due to funding issues, interim analysis was performed. Twelve patients were assigned to the EEGR group and eight patients were assigned to the WF group. Although the muscle volume of the quadriceps and hamstring did not differ between the two groups, the normalized peak torque of the operated knee flexors (11.28 ± 16.04 Nm/kg) was improved in the EEGR group compared to that of the operated knee flexors in the WF group (4.25 ± 14.26 Nm/kg) ( p = 0.04). The normalized compound motor action potentials of the vastus medialis (VM) and biceps femoris (BF) were improved in the EEGR group ( p &lt; 0.05). However, the normalized real-time peak amplitude and total, mean area under the curve of VM were decreased during rehabilitation in the EEGR group ( p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were found between operated and non-operated knees in the EEGR group. Five-day EEGR-assisted rehabilitation induced strengthening in the knee flexors and the muscular reactivation of the BF and VM after TKA, while reducing the real-time use of the VM. This observation may suggest the feasibility of this technique: EEGR modulated the neuronal system of the patients rather than training their muscles. However, because the study was underpowered, all of the findings should be interpreted with the utmost caution."
https://openalex.org/W3111820488,"Introduction Few studies have focused on enhancing causality and yielding unbiased estimates on the effectiveness of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR) on the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in a real-world setting. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of BCPR on the outcomes of OHCA and its differences according to the characteristics of OHCA. Methods This study enrolled all patients with OHCA of cardiac etiology treated by emergency medical services (EMS) in Korea from 2012 to 2015. The endpoints were survival and neurological recovery at discharge, and the main exposure was BCPR conducted by a layperson. The effect of BCPR was analyzed after adjusting for confounders, determined using a directed acyclic graph, by inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and model-based standardization (STR). Moreover, differences in subgroups and time trends were evaluated. Results Among 10,505 eligible patients after excluding those with missing data on BCPR, 7,721 patients received BCPR, accounting for 74.3% of EMS-treated OHCA patients. BCPR increased the odds of survival and good neurological recovery at discharge by 1.67- (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.44–1.93) and 1.93- (95% CI: 1.56–2.39) fold, respectively, in the IPTW analysis. These findings were comparable to those obtained with STR. The odds ratios were 2.39 (95% CI: 1.91–2.94) and 2.70 (95% CI: 1.94–3.41), respectively, in the sensitivity analysis of the missing BCPR information considering confounders and the outcome variable. However, the effect of qualified BCPR was not evenly distributed, and it did not increase with time. BCPR was likely to be more effective in male patients aged &lt;65 years, those who experienced an OHCA in a private place or non-capital region, and those with shockable rhythm at the scene. Conclusion Based on data from a nationwide registry, the estimated effect of BCPR on survival and neurological recovery was moderate and did not improve from 2012 to 2015."
https://openalex.org/W3111943743,"During most part of Western classical music history, tempo , the speed of music, was not specified, for it was considered obvious from musical context. Only in 1815, Maelzel patented the metronome. Beethoven immediately embraced it, so much as to add tempo marks to his already published eight symphonies. However, these marks are still under dispute, as many musicians consider them too quick to be played and even unmusical, whereas others claim them as Bethoven’s supposedly written will. In this work, we develop a methodology to extract and analyze the performed tempi from 36 complete symphonic recordings by different conductors. Our results show that conductor tempo choices reveal a systematic deviation from Beethoven’s marks, which highlights the salience of “correct tempo ” as a perceptive phenomenon shaped by cultural context. The hasty nature of these marks could be explained by the metronome’s ambiguous scale reading point, which Beethoven probably misinterpreted."

However, little is known about Kac in Solenopsis invicta , which is among the 100 most dangerous invasive species in the world. Kac in S . invicta was evaluated for the first time in this study. Altogether, 2387 Kac sites were tested in 992 proteins. The prediction of subcellular localization indicated that most identified proteins were located in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus. Venom allergen Sol i 2, Sol i 3, and Sol i 4 were found to be located in the extracellular. The enriched Kac site motifs included Kac H, Kac Y, Kac G, Kac F, Kac T, and Kac W. H, Y, F, and W frequently occurred at the +1 position, whereas G, Y, and T frequently occurred at the –1 position. In the cellular component, acetylated proteins were enriched in the cytoplasmic part, mitochondrial matrix, and cytosolic ribosome. Furthermore, 25 pathways were detected to have significant enrichment. Interestingly, arginine and proline metabolism, as well as phagosome, which are related to immunity, involved several Kac proteins. Sequence alignment analyses demonstrated that V-type proton ATPase subunit G, tubulin alpha chain, and arginine kinase, the acetylated lysine residues, were evolutionarily conserved among different ant species. In the investigation of the interaction network, diverse interactions were adjusted by Kac. The results indicated that Kac may play an important role in the sensitization, cellular energy metabolism, immune response, nerve signal transduction, and response to biotic and abiotic stress of S . invicta . It may be useful to confirm the functions of Kac target proteins for the design of specific and effective drugs to prevent and control this dangerous invasive species."
https://openalex.org/W3113284737,"Paper wasps ( Polistes dominula ), parasitized by the strepsipteran Xenos vesparum , are castrated and desert the colony to gather on plants where the parasite mates and releases primary larvae, thus completing its lifecycle. One of these plants is the trumpet creeper Campsis radicans : in a previous study the majority of all wasps collected from this plant were parasitized and focused their foraging activity on C . radicans buds. The unexpected prevalence and unusual feeding strategy prompted us to investigate the influence of this plant on wasp behavior and physiology through a multidisciplinary approach. First, in a series of laboratory bioassays, we observed that parasitized wasps spent more time than non-parasitized ones on fresh C . radicans buds, rich of extra-floral nectaries (EFNs), while the same wasps ignored treated buds that lacked nectar drops. Then, we described the structure and ultra-structure of EFNs secreting cells, compatible with the synthesis of phenolic compounds. Subsequently, we analysed extracts from different bud tissues by HPLC-DAD-MS and found that verbascoside was the most abundant bioactive molecule in those tissues rich in EFNs. Finally, we tested the immune-stimulant properties of verbascoside, as the biochemical nature of this compound indicates it might function as an antibacterial and antioxidant. We measured bacterial clearance in wasps, as a proxy for overall immune competence, and observed that it was enhanced after administration of verbascoside—even more so if the wasp was parasitized. We hypothesize that the parasite manipulates wasp behavior to preferentially feed on C . radicans EFNs, since the bioactive properties of verbascoside likely increase host survival and thus the parasite own fitness."
https://openalex.org/W3111562430,"Researchers in the social sciences have increasingly studied how emotions influence decision-making. We argue that research on emotions arising naturally in real-world environments is critical for the generalizability of insights in this domain, and therefore to the development of this field. Given this, we argue for the increased use of the “quasi-field experiment” methodology, in which participants make decisions or complete tasks after as-if-random real-world events determine their emotional state. We begin by providing the first critical review of this emerging literature, which shows that real-world events provide emotional shocks that are at least as strong as what can ethically be induced under laboratory conditions. However, we also find that most previous quasi-field experiment studies use statistical techniques that may result in biased estimates. We propose a more statistically-robust approach, and illustrate it using an experiment on negative emotion and risk-taking, in which sports fans completed risk-elicitation tasks immediately after watching a series of NFL games. Overall, we argue that when appropriate statistical methods are used, the quasi-field experiment methodology represents a powerful approach for studying the impact of emotion on decision-making."

This study was premised on the null hypothesis that an artificially induced E d or negative pressure does not impact MTI discharge. Moistube tubing was enclosed in a 1 m long PVC conduit. A 20 l water reservoir placed on an electronic balance provided a continuous supply of water whilst a three-speed hot air blower facilitated the radiative factor and advection process. The procedure was conducted under varied climatic conditions with three air velocity ( u a ) treatments namely; 1.2 m.s -1 , 2.5 m.s -1 , and 3.0 m.s -1 and the experiment run times were 159 h, 134 h and 10 h, respectively. The average temperature ( T ave ) and relative humidity (RH) data for u a = 1.2 m.s -1 were 53°C and 7.31%, whilst for u a = 2.5 m.s -1 , T ave was 56°C and RH = 7.19%, and for u a = 3.0 m.s -1 , T ave was 63°C and RH = 6.16%. The experimental data was input into the four variable Penman-Monteith method to compute the evaporative demand ( E d ). For each E d , the instantaneous mass flow rate ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:mover accent=""true""><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math> ) was recorded using an electronic balance and subsequently converted to volumetric flow rates. For each of the air velocities, the respective E d values obtained were 0.16, 0.31 and 0.36 mm.d -1 . The Bowen ratios ( r ) were well below 1 ( r &lt; 1), which suggested a sufficient supply of moisture to evaporate. For E d = 0.16 mm.d -1 the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was 113.08 mbars, whilst for E d = 0.31 mm.d -1 and for E d = 0.36 mm.d -1 the VPD were 129.93 mbars and 150.14 mbars, respectively. The recorded discharges ( q ) at normalised time ( t *) = 1 h for E d = 0.16 mm.d -1 was 7.67*10 −3 l.hr -1 .m -1 length, whilst for E d = 0.31 mm.d -1 q = 14.5*10 −3 l.hr -1 .m -1 length, and for E d = 0.36 mm.d -1 q = 20.8*10 −3 l.hr -1 .m -1 length. The imposed negative pressure causes an exponential increase in Moistube™ discharge, thus disproving the null hypothesis. The higher the evaporative demand the higher the discharge. This phenomenon allows MTI to be used for deficit irrigation purposes and allows irrigators to capitalize on realistic soil matric potential irrigation scheduling approach."
