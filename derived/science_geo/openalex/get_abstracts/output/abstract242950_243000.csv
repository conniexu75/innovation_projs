https://openalex.org/W1964982019,"The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic of 2003 caused almost 800 deaths, many of them due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a complication. There are no effective drugs available for treating ARDS, but new work in mice suggests that ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) might be an option. ACE2 can protect mice from lung injury in an ARDS-like syndrome, whereas other components of the renin–angiotensin system for controlling blood pressure and salt balance actually make the condition worse. ACE2 is expressed in the healthy lung but downregulated by lung injury and it was shown recently (Nature 426, 450–454; 2003) to be a receptor for the SARS coronavirus. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of acute lung injury, is a devastating clinical syndrome with a high mortality rate (30–60%) (refs 1–3). Predisposing factors for ARDS are diverse1,3 and include sepsis, aspiration, pneumonias and infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus4,5. At present, there are no effective drugs for improving the clinical outcome of ARDS1,2,3. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are homologues with different key functions in the renin–angiotensin system6,7,8. ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II and is a negative regulator of the system. ACE2 has also recently been identified as a potential SARS virus receptor and is expressed in lungs9,10. Here we report that ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2) protect mice from severe acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration or sepsis. However, other components of the renin–angiotensin system, including ACE, angiotensin II and the angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT1a), promote disease pathogenesis, induce lung oedemas and impair lung function. We show that mice deficient for Ace show markedly improved disease, and also that recombinant ACE2 can protect mice from severe acute lung injury. Our data identify a critical function for ACE2 in acute lung injury, pointing to a possible therapy for a syndrome affecting millions of people worldwide every year."

https://openalex.org/W1968044382,"The tumour microenvironment can be a potent carcinogen, not only by facilitating cancer progression and activating dormant cancer cells, but also by stimulating tumour formation. We have previously investigated stromelysin-1/matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), a stromal enzyme upregulated in many breast tumours, and found that MMP-3 can cause epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant transformation in cultured cells, and genomically unstable mammary carcinomas in transgenic mice. Here we explain the molecular pathways by which MMP-3 exerts these effects: exposure of mouse mammary epithelial cells to MMP-3 induces the expression of an alternatively spliced form of Rac1, which causes an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS stimulate the expression of the transcription factor Snail and EMT, and cause oxidative damage to DNA and genomic instability. These findings identify a previously undescribed pathway in which a component of the breast tumour microenvironment alters cellular structure in culture and tissue structure in vivo, leading to malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2140322314,"At low temperatures, sufficiently small metallic and semiconductor devices exhibit the 'Coulomb blockade' effect, in which charge transport through the device occurs on an electron-by-electron basis. For example, a single electron on a metallic island can block the flow of another electron if the charging energy of the island greatly exceeds the thermal energy. The analogous effect of 'photon blockade' has been proposed for the transport of light through an optical system; this involves photon-photon interactions in a nonlinear optical cavity. Here we report observations of photon blockade for the light transmitted by an optical cavity containing one trapped atom, in the regime of strong atom-cavity coupling. Excitation of the atom-cavity system by a first photon blocks the transmission of a second photon, thereby converting an incident poissonian stream of photons into a sub-poissonian, anti-bunched stream. This is confirmed by measurements of the photon statistics of the transmitted field. Our observations of photon blockade represent an advance over traditional nonlinear optics and laser physics, into a regime with dynamical processes involving atoms and photons taken one-by-one."

https://openalex.org/W2146175559,"H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) has emerged as a pathogenic entity for a variety of species, including humans, in recent years. Here we report an outbreak among migratory birds on Lake Qinghaihu, China, in May and June 2005, in which more than a thousand birds were affected. Pancreatic necrosis and abnormal neurological symptoms were the major clinical features. Sequencing of the complete genomes of four H5N1 AIV strains revealed them to be reassortants related to a peregrine falcon isolate from Hong Kong and to have known highly pathogenic characteristics. Experimental animal infections reproduced typical highly pathogenic AIV infection symptoms and pathology."

An increase in nuclear EGFR is also observed after treatment with H2O2, heat, or cisplatin. During, this process, the proteins Ku70/80 and the protein phosphatase 1 are transported into the nucleus. As a consequence, an increase in the nuclear kinase activity of DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) and increased formation of the DNA end-binding protein complexes containing DNA-PK, essential for repair of DNA-strand breaks, occurred. Blockade of EGFR import by the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody C225 abolished EGFR import into the nucleus and radiation-induced activation of DNA-PK, inhibited DNA repair, and increased radiosensitivity of treated cells.

Our data implicate a novel function of the EGFR during DNA repair processes. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; Gy, gray; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SF2, surviving fraction at 2 Gy. is essential for mediation of both proliferative and survival signals to cells (1Citri A. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). At least five mitogenic growth factors bind to and activate EGFR. In addition to EGF these factors include transforming growth factor-α, amphiregulin, heparin binding EGF (2Khazaie K. Schirrmacher V. Lichtner R.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 255-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and epiregulin (3Komurasaki T. Toyoda H. Uchida D. Nemoto N. Growth Factors. 2002; 20: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, in recent years it became apparent that in addition to ligand binding-induced activation of the EGFR, ligand-independent receptor activating processes also exist (4Boerner J.L. Danielsen A. Maihle N.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Activation of the EGFR signaling pathway by ligands has been linked with increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis and decreased apoptosis (5Ritter C.A. Arteaga C.L. Semin. Oncol. 2003; 30: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As a consequence it is assumed that increased EGFR signaling plays an important role in tumorigenesis (6Baselga J. Oncologist. 2002; 7: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 7Gupta A.K. McKenna W.G. Weber C.N. Feldman M.D. Goldsmith J.D. Mick R. Machtay M. Rosenthal D.I. Bakanauskas V.J. Cerniglia G.J. Bernhard E.J. Weber R.S. Muschel R.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 885-892PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms of ligand-independent EGFR activation and also the importance for the cell fate are not understood so far. But it is noteworthy that the ligand-independent activation always is linked to exposure to genotoxic stress (4Boerner J.L. Danielsen A. Maihle N.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Simeonova P.P. Wang S. Hulderman T. Luster M.I. J. Biol.

Photobiol. 2000; 72: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the differences of the observed cell response after ligand-induced EGFR activation, e.g. cell proliferation, and ligand-independent activation, e.g. cell cycle arrest, argue rather for a link to DNA repair processes for ligand-independent activation. This idea was strengthened by the observation that many tumor cells show an increased radiosensitivity after inhibition of EGFR signaling (10Harari P.M. Huang S.M. Semin. Radiat. Oncol. 2001; 11: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The most detrimental DNA damages after treatment with ionizing radiation are double-strand strands (11Gatei M. Zhou B.B. Hobson K. Scott S. Young D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17276-17280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which are preferentially repaired in mammalians by nonhomologous end-joining (12Rothkamm K. Kuhne M. Jeggo P.A. Lobrich M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3886-3893PubMed Google Scholar). Looking for a connection between radiation-induced EGFR activation and DNA repair, we found a report stating that there is a physical interaction of EGFR and DNA-dependent kinase (DNA-PK) (13Bandyopadhyay D. Mandal M. Adam L. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1568-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) after cell treatment with the EGFR blocking antibody C225. As a consequence, the nuclear DNA-PK protein and activity was reduced, providing an explanation for the radiosensitizing effect of the EGFR blockage. However, this paper did not answer the question of the functional role of the physical interaction between EGFR and DNA-PK. Therefore, we addressed herein the question of the role of the complex formation between EGFR and DNA-PK and the importance for cell survival after exposure to ionizing radiation. We could show that EGFR import to the nucleus proceeds the complex formation in the nucleus. The EGFR import and the linked transport of accessory proteins leads to an increase in DNA-PK activity, which correlates to an increased formation of the DNA end-binding protein complex. Thus, these data directly link the ionizing-induced activation of the EGFR with DNA repair processes and give an explanation for the success of combination of radiation treatment and EGFR blockage during tumor treatment. There is increasing evidence that overexpression or mutation of EGFR is associated with aggressive tumor growth as well as with poor treatment outcome of common cancers in man (14Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 2787-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). This association is likely related to the EGFR essential role in mediating both proliferative and survival signals in cells (1Citri A. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Exposure to genotoxic stress results in ligand-independent phosphorylation and activation of the EGFR (4Boerner J.L. Danielsen A. Maihle N.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is speculated that this process is linked with regulation of DNA repair processes (10Harari P.M. Huang S.M. Semin. Radiat. Oncol. 2001; 11: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Milas L. Mason K.A. Liao Z. Ang K.K. Head Neck. 2003; 25: 152-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Two recent observations encouraged us to focus our interest on a possible link between EGFR and DNA repair. First, Bandyopadhyay et al. (13Bandyopadhyay D. Mandal M. Adam L. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1568-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) showed a physical interaction between EGFR and the DNA repair relevant enzyme (DNA-PK) (11Gatei M. Zhou B.B. Hobson K. Scott S. Young D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17276-17280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) after incubation with the EGFR-blocking antibody C225. Second, Lin et al. (16Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) demonstrated nuclear localization of EGFR which would bring the EGFR in physical contact with sites of DNA damage. Thus, we analyzed the location of EGFR and its molecular interactions after radiation exposure. Cell Culture and Irradiation—Human bronchial carcinoma cells, designated A549 (17Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), were used in all experiments. Additionally, cells of the human squamous carcinoma cell line FaDu (ATCC, origin head and neck cancer, passage 124) and of the transformed human fibroblast cell line HH4dd (derived from human skin, passage 65-70) were used. The HH4dd cell line arose spontaneously from the normal cell strain HH4 and is characterized by growth in soft agar, aneuploidy, and tumor growth in nude mice (18Dittmann K.H. Gueven N. Mayer C. Ohneseit P. Zell R. Begg A.C. Rodemann H.P. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures were irradiated with 225-kV photons (Gulmay R S225) at a dose rate of 3 Gy/min at 37 °C. Trypsinized cells were seeded for colony formation assay in 78-cm2 plates. 24 h after plating cells were irradiated, and after 10 days colonies were fixed, stained, and counted. EGFR antibody C225 (Cetuximab) was purchased from Oncogene (Boston, MA) and used in a concentration of 30 nm for 1 h before irradiation. Confocal Microscopy—A549 cells were cultivated on CultureSlides (BD Biosciences), irradiated with 4 Gy, and after 5 min fixed with periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were incubated with anti-EGFR (BD Biosciences, clone 13) (1:20) overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were visualized by incubation with a 1:500 dilution of a Cy3-donkey anti-mouse serum (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with YO-PRO (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). The nuclei were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP, Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany). Detection of EGFR-specific Immune Complexes—Confluent cell cultures were irradiated as described above, and immune precipitation was performed according to standard procedures with the anti-EGFR antibody (clone R19/48, BIOSOURCE)(1:200) over night at 4 °C. Western blotting was performed according to standard procedures. The primary antibodies were diluted as follows: anti-DNA-PK (Pharmingen, clone 4F10C5) 1:500, phospho-specific T2609 anti-DNA-PK and phospho-specific S2056 anti-DNA-PK (both generous gifts of Benjamin Chen), anti-EGFR (BD Transduction Laboratories, clone 13) 1:1000, anti-P-EGFR (Calbiochem, clone 9H2) 1:1000, anti-Ku 70 (BD Transduction Laboratories, clone 15) 1:500, anti-Ku 80 (BD Transduction Laboratories, clone 111) 1:500, anti-protein phosphatase 1-phosphatase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, clone FL-18) 1:1000, anti-phosphotyrosine (Oncogene, clone PY20) 1:250, and calnexin (BD Transduction Laboratories, clone 37) 1:500. Quantification was achieved by incubation with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody with the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). EGFR Autophosphorylation—Confluent cells were treated with ionizing radiation and cells were then lysed, and the EGFR was immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoprecipitates were buffered with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 μm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The EGFR kinase reaction was started by the addition of 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer. Proteins were electrophoretically separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EGFR autophosphorylation was visualized by fluorography. Subcellular Fractionation—Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the instructions of the NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce). Isolation of DNA-associated Proteins—The nuclei of 40 × 106 cells were isolated as described above. Nuclei were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min on ice, washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and disrupted by ultrasonic treatment. DNA was precipitated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol overnight at 4 °C. DNA was washed two times with ethanol and dried. Bound proteins were resolved by the addition of SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detected with specific antibodies. Quantification of DNA-PK Activity—DNA-PK was immunoprecipitated from 2 mg of cell lysate with a monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen, clone 4F10C5). The immuno-complexes were washed and buffered with kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 μm ATP). Kinase activity was quantified in the presence of 1 μg of GST-TP531-50 peptide (19Gueven N. Keating K.E. Chen P. Fukao T. Khanna K.K. Watters D. Rodemann P.H. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8884-8891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. After SDS-PAGE separation, phosphorylated GST-TP53 peptide was visualized by fluorography. GST-TP531-50 fusion protein was produced by the help of the glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system (Amersham Biosciences). The specificity of the kinase reaction was determined by use of the kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Calbiochem, 20 μm) and cell lysates derived from DNA-PK-deficient SCID cells. Specificity of the assay was proven by detection of phosphorylated DNA-PK in the fraction of nuclear proteins after Western blotting by help of specific antibodies (anti-DNA-PK (P-S2056 and P-T2609) (20Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), anti-ATM (P-S1981) (Rockland 1:600)). DNA End Binding Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with the 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide GGGCCAAGAATCTTAGCAGTTTCGGG (21Apte U.M. Limaye P.B. Ramaiah S.K. Vaidya V.S. Bucci T.J. Warbritton A. Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 69: 448-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The gel shift assay was performed according to procedures described in technical bulletin no. 110 (Promega, Madison, WI). The binding reaction was performed in AP1 binding buffer (Promega) for 20 min at room temperature. For the supershift reaction 10 μg of nuclear extract was preincubated with 5 μg of DNA-PK antibody (RB-DPK10, GeneTex, San Antonio, TX) for 2 h at room temperature before the DNA end binding reaction. Quantification of γ-H2AX Foci Formation—Cells were cultivated on CultureSlides (BD Biosciences), incubated with C225 (30 nm) for 1 h, irradiated, and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol after 24 h. For immunefluorescence analysis cells were incubated with γ-H2AX antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, clone JBW301) (1:500) for 2 h at room temperature. Positive foci were visualized by incubation with a 1:500 dilution of Alexa-488-labeled goat anti-mouse serum (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield/4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). For each data point from 300 to 500 nuclei were evaluated. To elucidate the subcellular localization of EGFR after irradiation, we performed confocal microscopy. We failed to detect EGFR in the nucleus of unirradiated proliferating cells of the bronchial carcinoma line A549 in a noteworthy amount (Fig. 1, A and C). But there was a strong signal for EGFR in the perinuclear cell compartment. Irradiation, however, resulted in a clear translocation of the perinuclear EGFR to the nucleus (Fig. 1, B and D), and EGFR was detectable predominantly within regions characterized by sparse chromatin condensation (Fig. 1, D and E). Nuclear fluorescence intensity profiles integration indicated that irradiation increased Cy3 intensity (EGFR staining) within the nuclear region up to 24 times (data not shown). To confirm the nuclear localization of the EGFR, we separated cell cytoplasm and nuclei after irradiation. DNA-bound proteins in the nuclear fraction were cross-linked to DNA by incubation with formaldehyde, and subsequently DNA was precipitated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol. Within this preparation of DNA-bound proteins, we detected EGFR in increasing amounts with time after irradiation (Fig. 2A), whereas lamin B1 protein did not change. To exclude the possibility that ER-protein contaminants produced artifacts, we tested for the presence of calnexin, an ER-marker protein, in this preparation. We failed to detect calnexin within the fraction of DNA-bound proteins but did detect it within the fraction of cytoplasmic proteins, where it was abundant (Fig. 2A). To determine whether nuclear EGFR import also occurs after ligand-dependent EGFR activation, we treated cells with EGF. In contrast to the situation after irradiation, only a small amount of EGFR was detectable in the fraction of DNA-bound proteins both before and after treatment with EGF (Fig. 2B). We concluded from these results that nuclear import of EGFR occurs mainly after ligand-independent activation of EGFR by irradiation. The EGFR is phosphorylated both in a ligand-dependent and -independent manner. Thus, we asked the question of whether this phosphorylation can be linked with the observed nuclear transport. In A549 carcinoma cells, we detected a rapid increase in cytoplasmic EGFR phosphorylation within 5 min after irradiation (Fig. 3A). A rapid induction of EGFR phosphorylation was also observed after EGF treatment (Fig. 3A). With a short delay, EGFR phosphorylation increased in the nucleus as well, exclusively when cells were exposed to ionizing radiation. With increasing time after irradiation (from 5 to 20 min), EGFR phosphorylation in the cytoplasm decreased, but it increased in the nucleus, reaching a maximum at 20 min. At this time point cytoplasmic EGFR phosphorylation had returned to basal level. To further elucidate the function of nuclear EGFR, A549 cells were treated with several cellular stressors, and time-dependent nuclear EGFR import was quantified (Fig. 3B). Incubation with either H2O2 or cisplatin as well as treatment with heat (42 °C) induced EGFR transport into the nucleus within 5 min with similar time kinetics, whereas the amount of nuclear lamin B1 protein remained constant. The used stressors belong to the group of DNA-damaging agents, which suggests that the nuclear transport of the EGFR may be related to DNA repair processes. To determine the role of nuclear EGFR import, the physical interaction between EGFR and DNA-PK was investigated. Cells were exposed to a single dose of 4 Gy of ionizing radiation. Subsequently immune precipitation of EGFR and identification of EGFR-associated DNA-PK were performed. In all three cell lines tested (A459, HH4dd, and FaDu), we detected increased complex formation within 5 min after radiation exposure (Fig. 3C). To further elucidate the role of EGFR/DNA-PK complex formation we tested for an effect upon DNA-PK activity. Therefore, we irradiated cells and then assayed them for DNA-PK activity in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The major activity was detected within the nucleus. This activity significantly increased within 5 min after irradiation, as quantified by phosphorylation of a synthetic TP53-derived peptide (Fig. 3D). Using several cell lines and strains, we could show that radiation-induced EGFR nuclear transport can be correlated with DNA-PK activity (Fig. 3E). This is not only true for cells presenting an average radiosensitivity profile, as determined by clonogenic assays, e.g. the bronchial carcinoma cell line A549 (SF2 = 0.59) and normal skin fibroblasts (SF2 = 0.55), but also for FaDu cells, which are classified as radio-resistant (SF2 = 0.7). In contrast, in HL60 cells (SF2 = 0.34), which are EGFR-deficient, radiation failed to induce an EGFR transport into the nucleus, and the basal activity of DNA-PK is rather decreased after irradiation. Whereas in highly radiosensitive SCID cells (SF2 = 0.1), deficient in DNA-PK function, the radiation-induced EGFR transport to the nucleus was functional, but no DNA-PK activity was induced (Fig. 3E). We performed additional experiments to address a possible role for the import of EGFR and associated proteins to the nucleus in regulation of DNA-PK. First we determined the levels of EGFR protein in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus after irradiation (Fig. 4A). Shortly after irradiation, the EGFR levels in the nucleus increased (Fig. 4A). After the nuclear import of the EGFR increased, complex formation between DNA-PK and EGFR was observed (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the import of EGFR to the nucleus was accompanied by increased appearance of Ku 70 and Ku 80 proteins in the nucleus (Fig. 4, C and D), involved in regulation of DNA-PK activity. As known so far, DNA-PK activity is regulated by phosphorylation (20Chan D.W. Chen B.P. Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and dephosphorylation (22Douglas P. Sapkota G.P. Morrice N. Yu Y. Goodarzi A.A. Merkle D. Meek K. Alessi D.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) events. Phosphorylation at specific sites results in inactivation of enzyme activity; however, activity can be restored by protein phosphatase 1 or protein phosphatase 2A enzymes (23Douglas P. Moorhead G.B. Ye R. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18992-18998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We found that an increase in protein phosphatase 1 in the nucleus after irradiation was associated with the transport of the EGFR protein complex to the nucleus (Fig. 4E). To prove purity of nuclear protein preparation, we tested for contaminations with aldolase, a cytoplasmic marker protein. We could show that within the nuclear protein preparation no detectable contamination with aldolase was apparent (Fig. 4F), whereas the nuclear marker histone H1 is abundantly detectable. To answer the question of whether nuclear EGFR is linked to cytoplasmic EGFR, we incubated cells with β-methyl-cyclodextrin, which blocks the formation of the coated pits essential for EGFR internalization and quantified radiation-induced nuclear transport of the EGFR. Blockage of coated pit-mediated EGFR internalization had no effect on EGFR nuclear transport (Fig. 5A). Because it is described (24Miyamoto Y. Saiwaki T. Yamashita J. Yasuda Y. Kotera I. Shibata S. Shigeta M. Hiraoka Y. Haraguchi T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) that cellular stress can result in increased nuclear import by radical dependent processes, we incubated cells with the radical scavenger acetylcysteine and tested for radiation-induced nuclear EGFR import. We observed in the presence of acetylcysteine a complete inhibition of radiation-induced EGFR nuclear import (Fig. 5B). To elucidate the mechanism responsible for the nuclear transport of the EGFR, we incubated cells with leptomycin B, a nuclear export inhibitor, and with wheat germ agglutinin, an import inhibitor through the nuclear pore. Wheat germ agglutinin treatment completely blocked the radiation-induced increase of EGFR in the nucleus, whereas leptomycin B incubation resulted in an increased amount of EGFR in the nucleus which cannot be further increased by irradiation (Fig. 5C). The transport of proteins through the nuclear pore is typically mediated by karypherins and the protein RAN. Immune precipitation of nuclear EGFR after irradiation revealed a complex formation with both with karypherin α and with RAN. With increasing amounts of EGFR in the nucleus, complex formation with karyopherin α and Ran also increased (Fig. 5D). To confirm the importance of radiation-induced EGFR transport into nucleus for regulation of DNA-PK activity, we treated cells with the anti-EGFR antibody, C225, shown to block EGFR function (25Prewett M. Rockwell P. Rockwell R.F. Giorgio N.A. Mendelsohn J. Scher H.I. Goldstein N.I. J. Immunother. 1996; 19: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Our results presented in Fig. 6A clearly show that radiation strongly increased DNA-PK activity, which was nearly completely abolished by adding C225 antibody to cells 1 h before irradiation. To further characterize the effect of a C225 pretreatment, we incubated cells with C225 and quantified the amount of nuclear EGFR. We could show that radiation-induced nuclear EGFR transport was blocked (Fig. 6B). To further prove an effect of EGFR on regulation of DNA-PK activity, we quantified DNA-PK autophosphorylation with the help of phospho-specific DNA-PK antibodies. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with C225 did not effect autophosphorylation of DNA-PK at Ser-2065 (Fig. 6C); however, C225 pretreatment inhibited autophosphorylation at Thr-2609 (Fig. 6D). The observed modulations of DNA-PK activity were not due to an increase in DNA-PK protein amounts (Fig. 6, A, C, and D). To estimate the relevance of DNA-PK activity and the functional consequences of the C225-induced inhibition of nuclear EGFR transport and DNA-PK complex formation, we assessed the formation of the DNA end binding complex (Fig. 7). Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we identified two protein complexes whose expression was increased by irradiation. Treatment with C225 antibody inhibited formation of these complexes. Both complexes contained DNA-PK, as determined by supershift experiments using DNA-PK antibodies. To find out whether inhibition of radiation-induced DNA-PK activity can be correlated with decreased DNA repair after irradiation, we quantified γH2AX foci formation, which marks DNA strand breaks (26Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 27Rothkamm K. Lobrich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5057-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar) in the presence of C225 antibody (Fig. 8). Simultaneously we determined clonogenic survival by colony formation assays. We observed a slowed kinetic of γH2AX-foci removal, which corresponds to a slowed DNA-damage repair (Fig. 8A). Most noteworthy, residual damage 24 h after irradiation with different radiation doses was significantly increased after pretreatment with C225 compared with cells irradiated only (Fig. 8B). An increased residual damage was also observed in clonogenic assays 10 days after irradiation (data not shown), when the surviving fraction was clearly reduced after preincubation with C225 (Fig. 8C). Recently the EGFR has been detected in the nucleus of various tissues and cell lines (16Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Based on these data the authors suggest a role of EGFR as transcription factor. Moreover, based on data reporting a physical interaction between the EGFR and DNA-PK in mammalian cells (13Bandyopadhyay D. Mandal M. Adam L. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1568-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we addressed the potential role during cellular stress response, i.e. regulation of DNA repair after DNA damage. Consequently, as a major point we had to show that the EGFR is responsive upon irradiation and cellular stress. Indeed, it has been reported for some time that EGFR is phosphorylated after cellular stress responses, i.e. irradiation (28Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, the biological role of this process and the linked stress-associated intracellular signaling has to be elucidated. We could clearly show that after irradiation the EGFR enters the nucleus. This was shown by help of confocal microscopy, immune detection in nuclear preparations, and after DNA precipitation experiments. Thus, we are convinced that the EGFR is localized in the nucleus under certain circumstances, although we are awake to the possibility of a contamination, since the EGFR is ER-associated and the ER membrane is contiguous with the nuclear membrane, which means that protein localized to the ER could easily be misinterpreted as nuclear localization (30Oksvold M. Huitfeldt H. Stang E. Madshus I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E22-E23Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we could clearly show that the EGFR was detectable mainly in regions with low DNA density (Fig. 1, D and E). This observation fits perfectly with the idea that EGFR either interacts with DNA repair processes, since DNA repair preferentially occurs in regions of sparse chromatin condensation, where the access to DNA damage is eased, or acts as a stress-induced transcription factor (16Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). As already mentioned the EGFR import is accompanied by a phosphorylation of the EGFR"

These obligate intracellular parasites comprise some of the most important parasites of humans and animals, including the causative agents of malaria (Plasmodium spp.) and chicken coccidiosis (Eimeria spp.). The contents of the rhoptries are released into the nascent parasitophorous vacuole during invasion into the host cell, and the resulting proteins often represent the literal interface between host and pathogen. We have developed a method for highly efficient purification of rhoptries from one of the best studied Apicomplexa, Toxoplasma gondii, and we carried out a detailed proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry that has identified 38 novel proteins. To confirm their rhoptry origin, antibodies were raised to synthetic peptides and/or recombinant protein. Eleven of 12 of these yielded antibody that showed strong rhoptry staining by immunofluorescence within the rhoptry necks and/or their bulbous base. Hemagglutinin epitope tagging confirmed one additional novel protein as from the rhoptry bulb. Previously identified rhoptry proteins from Toxoplasma and Plasmodium were unique to one or the other organism, but our elucidation of the Toxoplasma rhoptry proteome revealed homologues that are common to both. This study also identified the first Toxoplasma genes encoding rhoptry neck proteins, which we named RONs, demonstrated that toxofilin and Rab11 are rhoptry proteins, and identified novel kinases, phosphatases, and proteases that are likely to play a key role in the ability of the parasite to invade and co-opt the host cell for its own survival and growth.

Apicomplexan parasites are protozoan parasites defined by the presence of a complex of specialized organelles at their apical end (1Dubremetz J.F. Garcia-Reguet N. Conseil V. Fourmaux M.N. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 2Kim K. Weiss L.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The phylum Apicomplexa contains many important pathogens of humans and animals, including the causative agents of malaria (Plasmodium spp.) and chicken coccidiosis (Eimeria spp.), as well as some of the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS patients such as Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum (3Levine N.D. J. Protozool. 1988; 35: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Most Apicomplexa have the capacity to invade and replicate within cells of their vertebrate hosts (1Dubremetz J.F. Garcia-Reguet N. Conseil V. Fourmaux M.N. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These host cells range from red blood cells in the case of Plasmodium spp. to virtually any nucleated cells in the case of Toxoplasma. Indeed, T. gondii is capable of infecting almost any warm-blooded animal and is arguably one of the most successful protozoan parasites, being of worldwide distribution with a seroprevalence that exceeds 50% for many of its host species (4Dubey J.P. Kreier J.P. Parasitic Protozoa. III. Academic Press, New York1977: 101-237Google Scholar). The apical complex that defines these protozoa has been implicated in attachment, invasion, formation of the parasitophorous vacuole, and subsequent growth of the parasites within the various cell types that are invaded (1Dubremetz J.F. Garcia-Reguet N. Conseil V. Fourmaux M.N. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 5Carruthers V.B. Parasitol. Int. 1999; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The complex consists of a microtubular spiral (the conoid) and two sets of apical secretory organelles called the micronemes and rhoptries (6Blackman M.J. Bannister L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7de Souza W. Souto-Padron T. Z. Parasitenkd. 1978; 56: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The micronemes are small, tubular-shaped (∼40 × 100 nm) organelles that contain adhesins that appear to facilitate attachment and invasion (5Carruthers V.B. Parasitol. Int. 1999; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These organelles release their contents upon contact with a host cell and include several molecules that span the plasma membrane of the parasite and provide a connection between the host cell and the actin/myosin-based motor of the parasite (8Opitz C. Soldati D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The rhoptries are perhaps the most unusual organelles found in the Apicomplexa (9Nichols B.A. Chiappino M.L. O'Connor G.R. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1983; 83: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Sam-Yellowe T.Y. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 308-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). They are large, club-shaped organelles that consist of a bulbous body and a narrow electron-dense neck that extends through the conoid at the apical tip of the parasite. The rhoptry necks serve as ducts through which the contents of the rhoptries are secreted during invasion. The neck portion of the rhoptry may also fuse with the micronemes to facilitate release of these organelles (11Bannister L.H. Hopkins J.M. Dluzewski A.R. Margos G. Williams I.T. Blackman M.J. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Mitchell G.H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3825-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The rhoptries release their contents after attachment has been completed and at the commencement of invasion (12Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). The secreted contents of the rhoptries include proteins and lipids that are packaged into a crystalline array in the organelle. The currently known components of the rhoptries of Toxoplasma have been designated ROP proteins (ROP1, ROP2, ROP4, ROP8, and ROP9) (13Sadak A. Taghy Z. Fortier B. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Reichmann G. Dlugonska H. Fischer H.G. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1992; 50: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, there are two rhoptry proteases (a subtilisin-like protein TgSUB2 and a cathepsin B-like protein, Toxopain-1) and a sodium-hydrogen exchanger TgNHE2 (17Karasov A.O. Boothroyd J.C. Arrizabalaga G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2005; 35: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Miller S.A. Thathy V. Ajioka J.W. Blackman M.J. Kim K. Mol.

Based on cDNA and genomic sequencing, the predicted amino acid sequence for all eight known rhoptry components includes a typical signal peptide characteristic of eukaryotic secreted proteins. In many cases, rhoptry proteins are initially synthesized as “pre-pro-proteins” (13Sadak A. Taghy Z. Fortier B. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Removal of the pro-domain occurs late during the process of transport to the rhoptries, probably within the rhoptries themselves (20Soldati D. Lassen A. Dubremetz J.F. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Bradley P.J. Hsieh C.L. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem.

In the case of the ROP1 protein, the pro-domain includes information sufficient for targeting artificial fusion constructs to the rhoptries (23Striepen B. Soldati D. Garcia-Reguet N. Dubremetz J.F. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Bradley P.J. Boothroyd J.C. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Each of the proteins known so far to be associated with the rhoptries has been localized within the bulbous body of the rhoptry rather than in the constricted necks (15Beckers C.J. Dubremetz J.F.

Parasitol. 1997; 89: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Only a single monoclonal antibody has been found specifically to stain the rhoptry neck region, but the identity of the target of this antibody is unknown (26Morrissette N.S. Bedian V. Webster P. Roos D.S. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 445-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ROP1 and ROP9 are soluble rhoptry proteins whose function is as yet unknown (14Reichmann G. Dlugonska H. Fischer H.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Ossorio P.N. Schwartzman J.D. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). ROP2, ROP4, and ROP8 are members of a family of membrane-associated proteins at least one of which (ROP2) has been implicated in recruitment of host cell mitochondria to the exterior face of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) 3The abbreviations used are: PVM, parasitophorous vacuole membrane; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IFA, immunofluorescence analysis; HFFs, human foreskin fibroblasts; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; R/DG, rhoptry/dense granule; PV, parasitophorous vacuole; ESA, excreted/secreted; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol.3The abbreviations used are: PVM, parasitophorous vacuole membrane; HA, hemagglutinin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IFA, immunofluorescence analysis; HFFs, human foreskin fibroblasts; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; R/DG, rhoptry/dense granule; PV, parasitophorous vacuole; ESA, excreted/secreted; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol.

This is apparently accomplished by the protein having its processed N terminus exposed to the host cell cytosol where it is “mistakenly” recognized as a mitochondrial import signal (27Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Host mitochondria recognize this sequence and in trying to import the ROP2 protein, which is firmly anchored in the PVM, are brought into close proximity to the PVM. The TgSUB2 and Toxopain-1 proteases have been implicated in processing of rhoptry proteins, whereas TgNHE2 is suggested to function in organellar osmotolerance (17Karasov A.O. Boothroyd J.C. Arrizabalaga G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2005; 35: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Miller S.A. Thathy V. Ajioka J.W. Blackman M.J. Kim K. Mol.

To understand the contribution of rhoptries to the processes of invasion and establishment of the parasitophorous vacuole for intracellular replication, we have undertaken a comprehensive proteomic analysis of their major protein constituents. We report here 38 novel proteins identified by mass spectrometry of a purified rhoptry fraction from T. gondii. HA epitope tagging and/or immunofluorescence using antibodies to peptides and recombinant proteins corresponding to 12 of these molecules confirms their rhoptry origin. Four antibodies react with the duct-like neck portion of the organelle and establish the first genes identified that encode rhoptry neck proteins in Toxoplasma. Parasite and Host Cell Culture—Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2 mm glutamine. T. gondii tachyzoites (RH strain) were maintained in confluent monolayers of HFFs. Purification of Rhoptries—Purified rhoptries were isolated using a Percoll gradient centrifugation protocol (modified from Refs. 28Leriche M.A. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar and 29Hehl A.B. Lekutis C. Grigg M.E. Bradley P.J. Dubremetz J.F. Ortega-Barria E. Boothroyd J.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7078-7086Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) followed by a sucrose floatation gradient as follows. 1.3 × 1010 tachyzoites (freshly lysed out of host cells) were collected by centrifugation at 1300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. The parasites were washed once in PBS and once in R buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The washed parasites were resuspended in R buffer at a concentration of 5 × 108 parasites/ml and then disrupted by passage through the French press as described (28Leriche M.A. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)). Intact parasites and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 1300 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 25 min to obtain a high speed organellar pellet. The pellet was resuspended in R buffer and Percoll added to 30% and centrifuged for 25 min at 61,500 × g. The brownish band (containing a mixed fraction of rhoptries, dense granules, mitochondria, and apicoplasts) near the bottom of the gradient was collected, diluted in R buffer, and pelleted again at 100,000 × g for 90 min to pellet the organelles and remove the Percoll. For the sucrose floatation gradient, the organelles were gently resuspended in 300 μl of R buffer and mixed with 2 ml of 60%(w/v) sucrose in S buffer (10 mm MOPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, Complete protease inhibitor mixture). This mixture was overlaid with steps of sucrose (48, 45, 42, 39, and 36%) in S buffer and centrifuged in the SW41 rotor at 150,000 × g for 18 h. Fractions were collected, and peak fractions containing rhoptry proteins were pooled, diluted in R buffer, and pelleted at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The purified rhoptry fraction was stored in R buffer at -80 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Rhoptry/dense granule (R/DG) fraction and purified rhoptries were separated by SDS-PAGE (11%), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies directed against proteins residing in various parasite compartments. The antibodies used were anti-ROP1 TG-49 (1:2000) (30Schwartzman J.D. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 760-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-ROP2/3/4 4A7 (1:2000) (13Sadak A. Taghy Z. Fortier B. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), anti-HSP-60 (Stress-Gen, 1:1000), anti-GRA3 T6 2H11 (1:2000) (28Leriche M.A. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and anti-AMA1 CL22 (1:2000) (29Hehl A.B. Lekutis C. Grigg M.E. Bradley P.J. Dubremetz J.F. Ortega-Barria E. Boothroyd J.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7078-7086Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Kirkegaard Laboratories) (1:2000) were used as secondary antibodies, and detection was performed using ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Carbonate Analysis of Membrane-bound Versus Soluble Proteins—Membrane and soluble fractions from the rhoptry/dense granule fraction were isolated using sodium carbonate extraction as described (31Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). A freshly prepared organellar R/DG fraction (200 μg) was pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.5. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min, and the membrane fraction was pelleted at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C, resuspended in R buffer, and stored at -80 °C. The soluble fraction was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, washed in ether, resuspended in 2% SDS, and stored at -80 °C. Equivalent fractions of the soluble and membrane fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Coomassie Blue), and analyzed by Western blot. Western blots were probed with antibodies directed against known soluble (GRA3) (28Leriche M.A. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and membrane-associated (ROP 2/3/4) (13Sadak A. Taghy Z. Fortier B. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) proteins to confirm the effectiveness of the fractionation. Mass Spectrometry of Rhoptry Proteins Resolved by SDS-PAGE—Rhoptry proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The entire protein gel profile was cut into 51 contiguous gel slices (Fig. 3). Gel slices were cut to include prominent protein bands, but slices were also taken from regions of the gel where there was no visible staining. Each slice was placed into a separate tube and processed for mass spectrometry independently. Gel slices were washed in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (1 h) followed by 50% acetonitrile, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (30 min), and finally 100% acetonitrile (10 min) before drying in a vacuum centrifuge. In gel digestion of proteins was then performed by incubation of the gel slice in a trypsin solution overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The resulting peptides were desalted and concentrated using ZipTip™ pipette tips containing C18 reverse phase media. The resulting concentrated desalted sample was then analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in an AB Q-star Pulsar. Tandem mass spectra were acquired in the following way, The time-of-flight-MS scan was run for 10 s to detect charged ions with a mass to charge ratio between 400 and 1000. Mass spectra were then acquired using a data-dependent acquisition mode in which each time-of-flight-ms full scan mass spectrum was followed by collision-induced dissociation of the eight most intense parent ions. Fragmentation was performed in positive polarity, and mass spectra were acquired for 15 s in the range of 50-2,000 m/z. Data Base Searching and Bioinformatics Analysis—The resulting MS/MS spectra were interpreted using the MASCOT® software by querying locally installed versions of the 10× Toxoplasma data base (ToxoDB, www.toxodb.org/). Partial carboxymethylation and oxidation of methionine residues were considered in the search. Our local data base containing a total of 881,411 T. gondii sequences was made up of the following: 790,769 genomic open reading frames >50 amino acids long; 69,764 EST open reading frame >50 amino acids; 4,954 Glimmer HMM protein predictions; 8,336 TigrScan protein predictions; 7,588 TwinScan protein predictions. For each identified protein, the exact position of each peptide was checked manually against alignments of genome contigs, EST positions, and protein prediction models using a generic gene model organism data base construction set (GBrowse www.gmod.org/) available for T. gondii at www.toxodb.org/. Where possible, each protein was assigned a TwinScan number. In cases where a matching TwinScan was either not available or ambiguous, contig coordinates were assigned for future identification of the protein. Generation of Anti-peptide Antibodies—Antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides deduced from sequences ROP10 (TgTwinscan_5042) (CEVDVFNPPLATKSD) and TgTwinscan_2001 (CVKLVLYDDKDTALR) that contain an N-terminal cysteine to aid in coupling to carrier proteins. The peptides were coupled to Imject-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates were then dialyzed against PBS, and 100 μg was injected into BALB/c mice in RIBI adjuvant (Corixa). Identical boosts were given at 21-day intervals. Polyclonal antisera was collected after the second boost and screened for reactivity by immunofluorescence analysis (IFA). Generation of Antibodies to Recombinant Protein—For expression in bacteria, portions of the genes encoding predicted rhoptry proteins were PCR-amplified and subcloned into either the pET28a (Novagen) vector or the pET161GW-D-TOPO (Invitrogen) vector that encode additional N- and/or C-terminal (His)6 tags for rapid purification. Plasmids were sequenced to verify the junctions of the vector and insert and then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21DE3 cells for expression. Bacteria containing the expression constructs were grown to an A600 of 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. His-tagged proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions and eluted using low pH according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted proteins were dialyzed against PBS and 10-50 μg injected per immunization into BALB/c mice. Polyclonal antiserum was collected after the second boost and screened by IFA and Western blot analysis. The protein name, region expressed (in amino acids), and oligonucleotide primers used for amplification are indicated in TABLE ONE.TABLE ONEOligonucleotide primers used for amplifying sequences encoding regions of proteins for bacterial expression Localization of RON4 to the Rhoptry Necks by Immunoelectron Microscopy—Lung and peritoneal exudate from T. gondii acutely infected mice containing tachyzoites and brain from chronically infected mice containing bradyzoites were processed for immunoelectron microscopy as described previously (32Ferguson D.J. Cesbron-Delauw M.F. Dubremetz J.F. Sibley L.D. Joiner K.A. Wright S. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 91: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thin sections were cut and mounted on Formvar-coated nickel grids. The grids were floated on drops of 1% BSA in PBS to reduce nonspecific staining. Sections were then floated on drops of rabbit anti-RON4, and after washing the antibodies were localized using goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to 10-nm gold particles. The rabbit anti-RON4 serum used for immunoelectron microscopy was raised to the bacterially expressed RON4. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate prior to examination in the electron microscope. Determination and Analysis of Coding Sequences of Verified Rhoptry Proteins—For proteins verified to be rhoptry proteins by antibody colocalization, the complete coding sequence was determined using EST analysis and direct sequencing of PCR-amplified cDNA. The amino acid sequences were analyzed for predicted signal peptides using Signal P 3.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) (33Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol.

Fluorescence Microscopy and Co-localization Studies—For IFA, HFFs on glass coverslips were infected with RH strain parasites for 30 h before fixation in either 2.5-3.5% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min or 100% ice-cold methanol for 3 min. The formaldehyde fixative was quenched in PBS, 100 mm glycine for 5 min, and then the coverslips were washed in PBS and blocked in PBS, 3% BSA. The samples were permeabilized in PBT (PBS, 3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 min and incubated in primary antibodies diluted in PBT for 1 h. The primary antibodies used were mouse polyclonal antisera generated against peptides for ROP10 (diluted 1:500) and TgTwinscan_2001 (1:200) and against His6-tagged proteins for ROP5,11-15 (1:200), RON1-4 (1:200), toxofilin (1:500), and Rab11 (1:300). Rabbit anti-ROP2 antiserum diluted 1:1000 (a gift from Jean-Francois Dubremetz (15Beckers C.J. Dubremetz J.F. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Joiner K.A. J.

The samples were then washed in PBS and incubated in secondary antibodies (Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit; Molecular Probes) diluted 1:2000 in PBT for 1 h. Following washing in PBS, the samples were mounted in Vectashield and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. The microscopes used were an Olympus BX60 (100× oil immersion objective) with images collected with a Hamamtsu Orca digital CCD camera using Image Pro Plus 4.0 software and a Zeiss Axioskop (100× oil immersion objective) with images collected with Zeiss Axiovision software. HA Epitope Tagging—ROP16 was PCR-amplified from RH genomic DNA using the forward primer TGCCTCAACTGTAAACGTCTT and reverse primer TTACGCGTAGTCCGGGACGTCGTACGGGTACATCCGATGTGAAGAAAGTTC. The forward primer was designed to anneal ∼2 kbp upstream of the ATG start codon as predicted by EST sequences; the resulting region should include all of the 5′-untranslated region and most or all of the ROP16 promoter. The reverse primer contains the sequence for a single HA tag at the C-terminal end of the protein. The amplified PCR product was cloned into the pHEX2 plasmid containing the hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HXGPRT) gene for use in selecting transformants (37Donald R.G.

The resulting vector was transfected into RH parasites lacking HXGPRT expression, and stable clones were derived using mycophenolic acid selection (37Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J.

https://openalex.org/W2008344420,"Nrf2 regulates the expression of genes encoding antioxidant proteins involved in cellular redox homeostasis. Previous studies have suggested that activation of Nrf2 is mediated by mechanisms promoting its dissociation from Keap1, a cytosolic repressor that acts to sequester the transcription factor in the cytoplasm. As a short-lived protein, Nrf2 is also activated by mechanisms leading to its stabilization in cells under stress, and recent evidence indicates that Keap1 has an active role in the control of its stability. In this report, using immunocytochemistry, cell fractionation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, we found that Nrf2 is primarily a nuclear protein and that it is expressed and recruited to the chromatin constitutively to drive basal gene expression. Furthermore, we found evidence indicating that Keap1 may repress Nrf2 activity by transiently shuttling into the nucleus to promote its ubiquitylation. The data suggested that the steady-state level of Nrf2 is maintained by a dynamic pathway that balances its constitutive expression with a Keap1-regulated degradation process downstream of its role as a transcriptional activator. We suggest that the stabilization of Nrf2 in cells under stress represents the central regulatory response mediated by mechanisms that interfere with its interaction with Keap1, leading to the induction of antioxidant enzymes important to maintain cellular redox homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2107043674,"Genetic studies place the transcription factor Osterix (Osx) downstream of Runx2, but limited information is available about Osx regulation during osteoblastic differentiation. An important role for bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) on Osx expression and the requirement for p38 for the BMP-2-mediated effect was reported previously by our group. In this study, we continued to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which BMP-2 and IGF-1 regulate Osx expression during osteoblast lineage progression. IGF-I-mediated Osx expression required all three MAPK components (Erk, p38, and JNK), whereas BMP-2 required p38 and JNK signaling. As a common mediator of growth factor signaling, we also investigated the involvement of protein kinase C/D (PKC/D) signaling. BMP-2- and IGF-I-mediated Osx expression was blocked in response to a PKD inhibitor. A selective inhibitor of conventional PKCs had no effect on the BMP-2-mediated Osx expression. BMP-2 and IGF-I induced a selective phosphorylation of PKD, and PKD was required for mineralization. PKC/D and MAPK signaling also mediate Runx2 activity. Therefore, to document the implication for Runx2 in Osx regulation, we blocked Runx2 activity using a dominant negative Runx2 construct and an ubiquitination mediator for Runx2 degradation. We showed that blocking Runx2 activity inhibited the BMP-2-mediated induction of Osx. These studies implicated that multiple signaling pathways mediate Osx, a critical gene for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. In addition to Runx2, other signaling components may be necessary to regulate Osx during osteoblast lineage progression."

All Ras isoforms are farnesylated and carboxyl-methylated at the terminal cysteine; H-Ras and N-Ras are further modified by palmitoylation. Yeast Ras is palmitoylated by the DHHC cysteine-rich domain-containing protein Erf2 in a complex with Erf4.

An essential motif for localizing Ras is the C-terminal -CaaX motif where “C” represents cysteine, “a” residues are typically aliphatic, and the “X” residue is methionine in N- and K-Ras and serine in H-Ras. The -CaaX motif of Ras is prenylated at the cysteine with a C15 farnesyl group by a cytoplasmic farnesyltransferase. This is followed by -aaX proteolysis and carboxylmethylation of the farnesylated cysteine catalyzed by enzymes localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. N-Ras and H-Ras have, respectively, one and two additional cysteine residues immediately upstream of the prenylated cysteine that are palmitoylated, whereas K-Ras has a polybasic domain. Ras signals from endomembranes as well as from the PM (7Chiu V. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson R. Cox A. Phillips M. Nat. Cell.

Nonprenylated forms of Ras proteins are cytoplasmic, fail to signal, and cannot transform cells (9Willumsen B.M. Christensen A. Hubbert N.L. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Nature. 1984; 310: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of Ras increases the affinity of farnesylated Ras for membranes and contributes to its biological activity (10Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that a complex of Erf2 (effect on Ras function 2) and Erf4 palmitoylates Ras2 (16Lobo S. Greentree W. Linder M. Deschenes R. J.

Chen L. Davis N. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Erf2 and Akr1 share a common domain, the Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC), within a cysteine-rich domain (CRD). In Akr1, the DHHC motif is replaced with DHYC. The CRD domain is essential for PAT activity. In both enzymes, mutations in the first His and the Cys of the DHHC motif abolish activity (16Lobo S.

The finding that these two otherwise unrelated proteins share a common protein domain that is essential for PAT activity has lead to the hypothesis that the DHHC-CRD is a protein fatty acyltransferase domain (15Linder M.

We sought to identify a human counterpart of the yeast Erf2·Erf4 complex that would palmitoylate mammalian Ras proteins. Here we describe a protein complex composed of DHHC9 and a Golgi-localized protein designated GCP16 (25Ohta E. Misumi Y. Sohda M. Fujiwara T. Yano A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol.

Construction of Expression Plasmids—Standard molecular biological techniques were used to manipulate DNA. All constructs derived from PCR were cloned directly into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and verified by DNA sequencing. The pCDNA3.1-Myc-His vectors are from Invitrogen. The pEGFP-N and -C vectors that fuse the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding region to the 3′ or 5′ ends, respectively, of the insert were purchased from Clontech. All of the point mutations were created using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. DHHC9 (accession number BC006200) and GCP16 (accession number BC001227) were obtained from the Image consortium (Image numbers 2964425 and 3456384, respectively). The GCP16 cDNA was PCR-amplified from the Image clone and subcloned from the TOPO vector into the XhoI/EcoRI sites of pEGFPC3, resulting in GFP-GCP16. For FLAG-GCP16, PCR primers were designed to add a FLAG tag to the N terminus and maintain the stop codon at the C terminus of GCP16 prior to subcloning as a NotI/EcoRI fragment into pCDNA3.1C(-). The same FLAG-GCP16 fragment was subcloned into the NotI/EcoRI sites of pBlueBac4.5 to generate high titer FLAG-GCP16 baculovirus using the Bac-N-Blue transfection kit (Invitrogen). The DHHC9 cDNA was PCR-amplified from the Image clone and subcloned from pCR2.1TOPO into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of either pCDNA3.1C(-) (DHHC9-Myc-His) or pEGFPN1 (DHHC9-GFP). The stop codon was mutated to alanine to prevent termination of translation prior to the C-terminal tags. The DHHC9-Myc-His cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pVL1393. High titer DHHC9-Myc-His baculovirus was generated using the Bac-N-Blue transfection kit. Antibodies—Myc-peptide fusion proteins were detected using monoclonal (mouse ascites) or polyclonal (Alexis) antibodies to the human Myc peptide. FLAG-tagged peptides were detected by probing with ANTI-FLAG® M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Rabbit polyclonal GFP antibodies were generated and affinity-purified as described (26Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy, rabbit polyclonal antibodies to giantin (Covance) and TRAP-α (translocon associated protein-α) (27Fons R.D. Bogert B.A. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were used to detect the Golgi apparatus and ER, respectively, both at a 1:1000 dilution. The TRAP-α antibody was a kind gift of Dr. Ramanujan Hegde (NICHD, National Institutes of Health). Secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were Alexa 546-conjugated (red) goat anti-mouse, Alexa 488-conjugated (green) goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes), and Cy3 (red) (Novus) antibodies, all at a dilution of 1:1000. Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was carried out using a human multiple tissue Northern blot (BD Bioscience Clontech) containing poly(A) mRNA (1 μg/lane). The membranes were prehybridized using ExpressHyb solution (BD Bioscience Clontech) with continuous shaking for 30 min at 60 °C. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 2 h with a [α-32P]dCTP labeled DNA fragment in ExpressHyb solution. The probes used were a 1.0-kb EcoRI/BamHI cDNA fragment corresponding to the open reading frame of DHHC9, a 0.5-kb NotI/EcoRI cDNA fragment corresponding to the open reading frame of GCP16, and the human β-actin cDNA control probe (BD Bioscience Clontech). The probes were prepared using the Prime-a-Gene kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK-293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 150 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. The cells were seeded at ∼3 × 105 cells/well of a six-well plate or 1 × 106 cells/plate for 100-mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The next day, the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM® medium (Invitrogen) without serum according to the manufacturer's protocol. For confocal microscopy, the cells were seeded into six-well plates containing coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine, transfected, and analyzed 24-48 h later. Coimmunoprecipitation—The cells were washed and collected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The pelleted cells were solubilized in TNE (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 2 mm EDTA) containing 1% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (Dojindo Laboratories) and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml lima bean protease inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a 25-gauge needle syringe and Dounce homogenizer. The lysates were incubated at 4 °C using end-over-end rotation and cleared at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor (30 min at 4 °C). The cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies conjugated to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Microscopy—For immunofluorescence, the cells (48 h post-transfection) were washed with PBS and fixed in a freshly prepared solution of 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 5% (w/v) sucrose for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin w/v, 1% normal goat serum v/v in PBS) for 10 min, and washed once in blocking buffer. Nonspecific staining was blocked by incubating cells for 45 min at room temperature in blocking buffer. For analysis of ER localization, the cells were washed in blocking buffer containing 0.1% saponin and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer containing 0.1% saponin and 50 μg/ml RNase A. All of the antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. The cells were incubated in the appropriate primary antibody for 1 h, washed three times in blocking buffer, and incubated for 1 h with appropriate secondary antibodies. After incubation in secondary antibody, the cells were washed three times in PBS, mounted onto slides with a drop of Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and immediately visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective. The confocal images were assembled as montages using Adobe PhotoShop 7.0 and adjusted only for brightness and contrast. Expression and Purification of Protein Substrates—Recombinant baculoviruses expressing human H-Ras or N-Ras as N-terminal His6-tagged fusions were generated using the Bac-N-Blue Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The N-Ras/pVL1393 transfer vector was a kind gift of Dr. Andrew Chan (Genentech). The transfer vector encoding H-Ras was prepared as follows. A BamHI-XhoI fragment encoding H-Ras was excised from H-Ras/pcDNA3.1+ (Guthrie Institute) and subcloned into pBlueBacHis2A digested with the same enzymes. H-Ras was purified from detergent extracts of Sf9 membranes using nickel chelate affinity chromatography (28Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of palmitate on the purified H-Ras has not been determined, but a significant fraction is probably lost during purification because of the action of thioesterases and the presence of reducing agents in the buffers. N-Ras was purified from the soluble fraction of Sf9 cells using nickel chelate affinity chromatography. Myristoylated Gαi1 was purified from bacteria expressing N-myristoyl transferase (29Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To form heterotrimeric Gi, Gαi1 was reconstituted with nonprenylated GβγC68S subunits purified from Sf9 cells (30Dunphy J. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43300-43304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recombinant GAP-43 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography (31Andreasen T.J. Luetje C.W. Heideman W. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4615-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The GAP-43 expression vector (32Schuh S.M. Spencer S. Willard M.B. Brain Res. 1991; 565: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Willard (Washington University). Synthesis of [3H]Palmitoyl-CoA and Ras PAT Assay—[3H]palmitate-CoA was prepared using [3H]palmitate (60 Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Coenzyme A (Sigma), and acyl CoA synthase (Sigma). The resulting [3H]palmitate-CoA was purified as described (33Dunphy J. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The PAT assay (final volume, 50 μl) was performed by mixing DHHC9·GCP16 in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside with 10 μl of Ras substrate in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of reaction mix (167 mm Mes, pH 6.4, 1 mm DTT, 1.7 mm [3H]palmitate-CoA). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 12.5 μl of a 5× solution of SDS gel loading buffer with DTT (final concentration, 5 mm), and boiled for 1 min before resolution on 13% SDS-PAGE. The gels were soaked for 20 min in a solution containing 1 m sodium salicylate and 15% methanol, dried, and subjected to fluorography. Alternatively, Ras protein bands were excised from the gel, solubilized in Soluene S-350 (Packard) for 3 h at 50 °C, and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Preparation of DHHC9·GCP16 Protein Complex—All of the buffers contain the protease inhibitors 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml lima bean, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and all of the steps were performed at 4 °C unless indicated. Sf9 cells were coinoculated with baculovirus expressing DHHC9 or GCP16 and incubated for 72 h at 27 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in 200 ml of cavitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 30 min under pressure at 500 psi. The lysate was centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min generating P100 and S100 fractions. P100 membranes were suspended in 100 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1% dodecyl-maltoside), subjected to Dounce homogenization, and incubated for 1 h with end-over-end rotation. The extract was cleared at 100,000 × g for 30 min, diluted 2-fold in extraction buffer without dodecyl-maltoside, and loaded onto 5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with extraction buffer containing 0.1% dodecyl-maltoside. The resin was washed in 20 volumes of wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% dodecyl-maltoside, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4), and the complex was batch-eluted (3 × 5 ml) in wash buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The first two elutions were pooled and diluted 2-fold in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% dodecyl-maltoside resulting in a final concentration of 12.5 mm NaCl and 100 mm imidazole and were further purified on a Mono Q HR 5.5 ion exchange column using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with five volumes of Mono Q buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.1% dodecyl-maltoside) and eluted with a 30-ml gradient of NaCl (0-1 m) in Mono Q buffer. Fractions containing DHHC9·GCP16 were identified by Western blot, pooled, and diluted 2-fold in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.1% dodecyl-maltoside, resulting in a final DTT concentration of 0.5 mm. The MonoQ pool was incubated with 150 μl of ANTI-FLAG® affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h by end-over-end rotation. The resin was transferred to a column, washed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.1% dodecyl-maltoside, and eluted in the same buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The purity of the enzyme preparation was determined by silver stain as described (34Morrissey J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2939) Google Scholar). The concentration of enzyme was determined by extrapolation from a linear curve with known concentrations of bovine serum albumin using Sypro Ruby protein gel stain (Molecular Probes) and quantitation with a Storm™ 860 (Amersham Biosciences). Identification of a Candidate Mammalian Ras PAT—A search of mammalian genomic data bases with the DHHC-CRD sequence of yeast Erf2 uncovered approximately 20 DHHC proteins. Of these, DHHC9 was chosen as the best candidate based on expect value (2 e-31), percent identity, and predicted structural similarities to Erf2. DHHC9 is a 364-amino acid protein (Fig. 1A) that shares 70% sequence identity with Erf2 in the DHHC-CRD (Fig. 1B) and 31% identity overall. Like Erf2, the sequence predicts a protein with four transmembrane spans and a DHHC domain in the cytoplasmic loop between the predicted second and third transmembrane spans (Fig. 1A). In yeast, Erf2 requires a second subunit, Erf4, for Ras PAT activity (16Lobo S. Greentree W. Linder M. Deschenes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41268-41273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Initial attempts to identify a mammalian homolog of S. cerevisiae Erf4 were unsuccessful. However, by aligning Erf4 sequences from S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans, it was possible to identify a putative Aspergillus homolog (tigrblast.tigr.org/er-blast/index.cgi?project=afu1). A BLAST search with the Aspergillus sequence yielded a candidate Erf4 sequence in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The S. pombe sequence was used as a query in iterative searches with PSI-BLAST (35Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar) to identify candidate mouse and human Erf4 homologs. A sequence alignment of the fungal, mouse, and human sequences is shown in Fig. 1C. The mammalian candidate for an Erf4 homolog is identical to GCP16 (Golgi-complex associated protein of 16 kDa), a palmitoylated protein that interacts with the Golgi-associated protein GCP170 (25Ohta E. Misumi Y. Sohda M. Fujiwara T. Yano A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51957-51967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We obtained full-length cDNAs for DHHC9 and GCP16 to investigate whether they encoded functional orthologs of Erf2 and Erf4. Tissue Distribution of DHHC9 and GCP16 —To determine whether the DHHC9 cDNA represents an authentic transcript, a Northern blot of poly(A) mRNA from various human tissues was hybridized with a probe derived from the DHHC9 cDNA. An abundant transcript (2.3 kb) was identified in kidney, skeletal muscle, brain, lung, and liver and to a lesser extent in placenta, heart, colon, and small intestine (Fig. 2A). The DHHC9 transcript was absent from thymus, spleen, and peripheral blood leukocytes. A previous study reported that GCP16 mRNA is also expressed ubiquitously (25Ohta E. Misumi Y. Sohda M. Fujiwara T. Yano A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51957-51967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We detected a transcript of similar size (1.9 kb) in all tissues except colon and thymus (Fig. 2B). There is a high degree of overlap in the expression of transcripts for DHHC9 and GCP16 (Fig. 2C). A notable exception is in peripheral blood cells where GC16 is found but DHHC9 is not. Subcellular Distribution of DHHC9 and GCP16 in HEK-293 Cells—Both yeast Erf2 and Erf4 behave as integral membrane proteins (36Bartels D. Mitchell D. Dong X. Deschenes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6775-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Zhao L. Lobo S. Dong X. Ault A.D. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49352-49359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether DHHC9 and GCP16 have similar properties, the nature of their membrane association was assessed. When expressed in HEK-293 cells, DHHC9 and GCP16 were resistant to extraction from membranes with salt or high pH but were extracted with the detergent dodecyl maltoside (data not shown). This behavior is characteristic of integral membrane proteins and similar to that of yeast Erf2·Erf4 (36Bartels D. Mitchell D. Dong X. Deschenes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6775-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Zhao L. Lobo S. Dong X. Ault A.D. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49352-49359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To address whether DHHC9 and GCP16 were associated with the same membrane compartment, we performed subcellular localization experiments using confocal microscopy and GFP and Myc-tagged proteins. GFP-GCP16 and DHHC9-Myc codistributed on internal membranes in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3A). Endogenous GCP16 has been previously shown to localize to the Golgi (25Ohta E. Misumi Y. Sohda M. Fujiwara T. Yano A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51957-51967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), consistent with our findings with the transfected protein (data not shown). DHHC9-Myc codistributed with the Golgi-specific marker giantin in HEK-293 cells expressing DHHC9 and GCP16 (Fig. 3B). Thus, both GCP16 and DHHC9 are localized at the Golgi. Studies of Ras palmitoylation, and trafficking in tissue culture cells indicates that mammalian Ras is palmitoylated on the Golgi (12Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). DHHC9·GCP16 therefore fulfills the requirement for a Golgilocalized Ras PAT. DHHC9-Myc immunofluorescence was also observed on internal membranes that extended to the periphery of the cell and coincided with that of an ER marker, TRAP-α (27Fons R.D. Bogert B.A. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). Thus, DHHC9 may also be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Coimmunoprecipitation of DHHC9 and GCP16 —If DHHC9 and GCP16 represent functional homologs of yeast Erf2·Erf4, then they are expected to form a stable protein complex.

TOR exists in two functionally and structurally distinct complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2). TORC1 controls cell growth via a rapamycin-sensitive signaling branch regulating translation, transcription, nutrient uptake, ribosome biogenesis, and autophagy. TORC2 controls the organization of the actin cytoskeleton through a rapamycin-insensitive signaling branch and in yeast consists of the six proteins AVO1, AVO2, AVO3, BIT61, LST8, and TOR2. Here we have focused on the characterization of TORC2. Our studies suggest that TORC2 is oligomeric, likely a TORC2-TORC2 dimer. AVO1 and AVO3 bind cooperatively to the N-terminal HEAT repeat region in TOR2 and are required for TORC2 integrity. AVO2 is a nonessential peripheral protein associated with AVO1 and AVO3. LST8 binds separately to the C-terminal kinase domain region in TOR2 and appears to modulate both the integrity and kinase activity of TORC2. TORC2 autophosphorylates sites in AVO1 and AVO3, but TORC2 kinase activity is not required for TORC2 integrity. We have demonstrated that mammalian TOR is also oligomeric. The architecture of TORC2 is discussed in the context of TORC2 assembly and regulation.

Target of rapamycin (TOR) 1The abbreviations used are: TOR, target of rapamycin; mTOR, mammalian TOR; HA, hemagglutinin. is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that controls cell growth in response to nutrients. TOR controls its various growth-related readouts via two distinct signaling branches, a rapamycin-sensitive and a rapamycin-insensitive branch (1Loewith R. Hall N.M. Hall M.N. Raff M. Thomas G. Cell Growth: Control of Cell Size, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 139-166Google Scholar, 2Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The TOR protein consists of several distinct domains. The N-terminal half of TOR comprises ∼20 tandemly repeated HEAT repeats (named for Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and TOR1) (3Perry J. Kleckner N. Cell. 2003; 112: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). HEAT repeats mediate protein-protein interactions and are required for localization of TOR to the plasma membrane (4Kunz J. Schneider U. Howald I. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37011-37020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The HEAT repeats are accompanied by a so-called FAT domain that possibly serves as a scaffold or protein interaction domain (5Alarcon C.M. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2531-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Bosotti R. Isacchi A. Sonnhammer E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 225-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Following the FAT domain are the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain, the kinase catalytic domain, and a C-terminal FATC domain. Because TOR contains a number of domains that may mediate protein-protein interactions, TOR has been proposed to exist in a multiprotein complex. Indeed, TOR is found in two complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2), both of which are at least partly conserved (7Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L.

These two complexes, which contain both common and distinct proteins, account for the specificity of TOR signaling. TORC1 mediates the rapamycin-sensitive signaling branch that positively regulates anabolic processes such as translation and ribosome biogenesis and negatively regulates catabolic processes such as RNA degradation, autophagy, and other degradative pathways (13Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : re15Google Scholar, 14Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 15Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3461) Google Scholar). TORC2 signaling is rapamycin-insensitive and is required for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TORC2 signals to the actin cytoskeleton by activating the RHO1 GTPase switch (16Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17Helliwell S.B. Schmidt A. Ohya Y. Hall M.N. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1211-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon activation via the exchange factor ROM2, RHO1 interacts with and activates PKC1. Activated PKC1 subsequently regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade consisting of BCK1, MKK1/2, and MPK1 (18Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). TORC2 also signals to the actin cytoskeleton via the two recently described substrates SLM1 and SLM2 (19Audhya A. Loewith R. Parsons A.B. Gao L. Tabuchi M. Zhou H. Boone C. Hall M.N. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3747-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). TORC1 in yeast consists of KOG1, TCO89, LST8, and either TOR1 (TORC1-A) or TOR2 (TORC1-B). TORC2 is composed of the proteins AVO1, AVO2, AVO3, LST8, TOR2, and the recently described BIT61 (7Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P.

Analysis of avo1 mutant cells revealed that AVO1 acts positively in TORC2. Similar to tor2 mutant cells, AVO1-depleted cells exhibit a defect in polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, hyperactivation of the RHO1 GTPase or the PKC1-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway suppresses an avo1 mutation (7Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L.

LST8, a highly conserved and essential protein (known as mLST8 or GβL in mammals), is composed almost entirely of seven WD40 domains. As LST8 associates with both TORC1 and TORC2, lst8 mutant cells resemble mutants defective in TORC1 or TORC2 (7Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W.

The specific molecular functions of the individual proteins within the two TOR complexes are largely unknown. We took a biochemical approach to study the role of the different proteins that form TORC2. We provide evidence that AVO1 and AVO3, but not AVO2, act as scaffold proteins important for the integrity of TORC2. LST8, which binds to the C-terminal half of TOR2, appears to be involved in modulating both the integrity of TORC2 and the kinase activity of TOR2.

Gel filtration was performed using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (7Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W.

Elution profiles of tagged TOR2 were analyzed by immunoprecipitation/Western analysis and compared with the elution profile of known standards. Mammalian Tissue Culture, Transfections, Immunoprecipitation— Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using jetPEI transfection reagent (Qbiogene) following the manufacturer's instructions and harvested after 24 h. Lysate preparation and immunoprecipitation were performed as previously described (12Jacinto E. Loewith R. Schmidt A. Lin S. Ruegg M.A. Hall A. Hall M.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and TAP Pulldowns—A 200-ml culture was grown in YPGal/Gly or YPD at 30 °C for 15 h to an A600 of 0.8, harvested by centrifugation, and washed with ice-cold water. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 20, plus inhibitors 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 × Roche complete inhibitor mixture). Cells were lysed by vortexing 5 × 30 s with glass beads using a FastPrep machine (Savant Instruments). Extracts were cleared with a 5-min, 2900 × g spin. An aliquot of extract containing 3 mg of protein was adjusted to 1 ml with lysis buffer plus inhibitors. To immunoprecipitate an epitope-tagged protein, 1 μl of either concentrated 12CA5 (anti-HA) or 9E10 (anti-Myc) tissue culture supernatant was added and the tubes were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Afterward, 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose slurry (Sigma) was added, and the tubes were rotated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. For TAP pulldowns, 20 μl of IgG-Sepharose 6 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and tubes were rotated for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For coimmunoprecipitations, the sample was split in half and each aliquot was subjected to SDS-PAGE; one aliquot was used for expression control and the other half to detect the coimmunoprecipitated protein. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, blocked in 5% milk in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with primary antibody (12CA5 or 9E10 1:10000 in blocking buffer or anti-Protein A 1:5000 in blocking buffer) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the corresponding horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The tagged proteins were detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Kinase Assays—Cells expressing HA-TOR2 in different mutant backgrounds maintained on YPD or YPGal/Gly medium were inoculated into YPGal/Gly liquid media and cultured overnight. Per strain (three assays), 3 liters of YPD was inoculated and grown at 30 °C for 15 h to an A600 of 0.8 and then chilled on ice for 30 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once in ice-cold water, and lysed with a Bead Beater (Biospec Products) in ∼20 ml of lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 20 plus inhibitors 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Roche complete inhibitor mixture). The lysate was cleared with a 5-min, 2900 × g spin. Lysates were normalized to ∼20 ml and ∼250 mg of protein per strain (three kinase reactions) and passed over 250 μl of Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma):Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (3:1) that had been previously equilibrated in lysis buffer. To the flowthrough was added 150 μl of anti-HA cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose beads. This mixture was rotated for 3 h at 4 °C, after which the beads were collected in a column and washed with 30 ml of lysis buffer. Antibody beads were split equally among three tubes. To each aliquot, 1.5 μg of 4E-BP1 (Stratagene) in 50 μl of kinase buffer (lysis buffer with 20% glycerol) and 6 μl of 10× buffer (40 mm MnCl2, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10× Roche complete inhibitor mixture-EDTA, 100 mm NaN3, 100 mm NaF, 100 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 100 mm β-glycerophosphate) were added. The kinase reaction was started with the addition of 4 μl of ATP mix (1.2 mm ATP, 2.5 μCi/μl γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in kinase buffer). Tubes were mixed (1200 rpm) at 30 °C for 10 min. The reactions were terminated with the addition of 15 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (5–20%). The top of the gel containing TOR2 was cut and subjected to immunoblotting, while the lower part was Coomassie Blue stained. Radioactivity was quantified using GeneSnap software (SynGene). Kinase reactions using the kinase-dead version of TOR2 were performed as described (19Audhya A. Loewith R. Parsons A.B. Gao L. Tabuchi M. Zhou H. Boone C. Hall M.N. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3747-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The activity of immunopurified TORC2 was compared with the activity of mock purified TORC2. TORC2 Is an Oligomer—Gel filtration of yeast extracts reveals that TORC2 exists as two species, one of 1.5–2 MDa and a second of 0.7–0.8 MDa (7Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The combined molecular masses of TOR2 and its TORC2 partner proteins yield a mass of 0.78 MDa. These findings suggest that TORC2 may exist in a multimeric state. To determine whether the components of TORC2 indeed interact with themselves, pairwise coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed with strains expressing heterologously tagged versions of TOR2, AVO1, AVO2, AVO3, or LST8. As shown in Fig. 1B, each of the examined components of TORC2 coimmunoprecipitated with its differently tagged copy, suggesting that TORC2 exists in an oligomeric state. Considering the molecular masses of the two species observed by gel filtration, TORC2 most likely forms a dimer. Nutrient limitation does not affect the integrity of TORC2 as measured by coimmunoprecipitation of different subunits (7Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). However, this assay would not detect whether TORC2 is regulated by association of TORC2 monomers, as different subunits would remain associated within a monomer. To investigate a possible role of TORC2-TORC2 oligomerization in TORC2 regulation, we examined whether heterologously tagged TOR2 or LST8 coimmunoprecipitated in cells that were starved for nitrogen (60 min). The interaction of Myc-TOR2 with HA-TOR2 or of LST8-Myc with LST8-HA was unaffected by nitrogen starvation (data not shown). Likewise, the molecular mass of TORC2 as determined by gel filtration was not affected by nutrient conditions (data not shown). Thus, TORC2 appears to exist in a dimeric or higher order state that is unaffected by nutrient limitation. However, the signaling cues that regulate TORC2 are unknown. Although ample evidence has been presented that TORC1 is regulated by nutrient cues, TORC2 is only assumed to be regulated in response to nutrient conditions. The significance of TORC2 oligomerization remains to be determined. To investigate whether mammalian TOR (mTOR) also oligomerizes, we examined whether Myc-mTOR coimmunoprecipitates with HA-mTOR in an extract prepared from human embryonic kidney 293 cells coexpressing the two differently tagged versions of mTOR. Myc- and HA-mTOR efficiently coimmunoprecipitated, indicating that, similar to TOR2 in yeast, mTOR oligomerizes in mammalian cells (Fig. 1C). It remains to be determined whether mTOR oligomerizes in mTORC1, mTORC2, or both. Pretreatment of cells with rapamycin (200 nm, 30 min) did not affect the mTOR-mTOR interaction (data not shown). AVO1 and AVO3 Are Important for the Structural Integrity of TORC2—To study the contribution of TORC2 components to TORC2 architecture, we depleted cells of individual TORC2 components and assayed, by coimmunoprecipitation, the interactions of the remaining subunits. Because most components of TORC2 are essential, we conditionally depleted cells of an essential partner by placing the corresponding gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter, which is active in galactose- and inactive in glucose-containing media. After growing cells in glucose medium for 15 h, the protein under control of the GAL1 promoter was no longer detectable by immunoblotting (data not shown). Cells depleted for a protein are referred to as mutant cells. The expression levels of the analyzed, remaining proteins did not vary upon depletion of any single TORC2 component. To investigate the role of AVO1 in the architecture of TORC2, interactions between the remaining TORC2 proteins were analyzed in an avo1 mutant. As shown in Fig. 2, upon depletion of AVO1, AVO2 and AVO3 no longer interacted with TOR2 (Fig. 2, A and B), LST8 (Fig. 2, C and D), or with each other (Fig. 2E). Conversely, TOR2 and LST8 still interacted in the absence of AVO1 (Fig. 2F). Because TOR2 and LST8 are also components of TORC1-B, coimmunoprecipitation of these two proteins could reflect an interaction within TORC1-B and could thus be misleading. To determine whether the interaction between TOR2 and LST8 in avo1 cells was due to contamination by TORC1-B, cell extracts were depleted of TORC1 by precipitating the TORC1-specific component KOG1. TAP-tagged KOG1 was precipitated by incubating the cell extracts with IgG-Sepharose prior to the coimmunoprecipitation experiment. When TORC1 was depleted, TOR2 still associated with LST8 in the absence of AVO1 (data not shown), indicating that this interaction was indeed TORC1-B-independent. Furthermore, TOR2 was found primarily in TORC2 (7Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, AVO1 is required for the binding of AVO2 and AVO3 to TOR2, LST8, and to each other but is not required for the interaction between TOR2 and LST8. Cells depleted of AVO3 showed similar defects in TORC2 integrity as described above. In avo3 mutant cells, AVO1 and AVO2 no longer associated with TOR2 (Fig. 3, A and B), LST8 (Fig. 3, C and D), or with each other (Fig. 3E). TOR2 still interacted with LST8 in the absence of AVO3 (Fig. 3F). The above observations combined with the fact that AVO2 is nonessential suggest that AVO2 is a peripheral protein that binds TOR2 via AVO1 and AVO3, although we cannot exclude the possibility that AVO1 and AVO3 cause a conformational change in TOR2 that allows AVO2 to bind directly to TOR2. Consistent with these models, AVO3 still interacted with TOR2 in an avo2 mutant (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, deletion of AVO2 did not affect the interaction between TOR2 and LST8 (Fig. 4B). Removal of LST8 destabilized but did not abolish the TOR2-AVO3 or the TOR2-AVO2 interaction (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, AVO1 and AVO3 bind TOR2 cooperatively and are particularly important for the integrity of TORC2.Fig. 4Role of AVO2, LST8, and TOR2 in the integrity of TORC2. A and B,"
https://openalex.org/W2085907524,"The role of ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation was recently described using ATF4-deficient mice (Yang, X., Matsuda, K., Bialek, P., Jacquot, S., Masuoka, H. C., Schinke, T., Li, L., Brancorsini, S., Sassone-Corsi, P., Townes, T. M., Hanauer, A., and Karsenty, G. (2004) Cell 117, 387–398). However, the mechanisms of ATF4 in bone cells are still not clear. In this study, we determined the molecular mechanisms through which ATF4 activates the mouse osteocalcin (Ocn) gene 2 (mOG2) expression and mOG2 promoter activity. ATF4 increased the levels of Ocn mRNA and mOG2 promoter activity in Runx2-containing osteoblasts but not in non-osteoblastic cells that lack detectable Runx2 protein. However, ATF4 increased Ocn mRNA and mOG2 promoter activity in non-osteoblastic cells when Runx2 was co-expressed. Mutational analysis of the OSE1 (ATF4-binding site) and the two OSE2s (Runx2-binding sites) in the 657-bp mOG2 promoter demonstrated that ATF4 and Runx2 activate Ocn via cooperative interactions with these sites. Pull-down assays using nuclear extracts from osteoblasts or COS-7 cells overexpressing ATF4 and Runx2 showed that both factors are present in either anti-ATF4 and anti-Runx2 immunoprecipitates. In contrast, pull-down assays using purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were unable to demonstrate a direct physical interaction between ATF4 and Runx2. Thus, accessory factors are likely involved in stabilizing interactions between these two molecules. Regions within Runx2 required for ATF4 complex formation and activation were identified. Deletion analysis showed that the leucine zipper domain of ATF4 is critical for Runx2 activation. This study is the first demonstration that cooperative interactions between ATF4 and Runx2/Cbfa1 stimulate osteoblast-specific Ocn expression and suggests that this regulation may represent a novel intramolecular mechanism regulating Runx2 activity and, thereby, osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. The role of ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation was recently described using ATF4-deficient mice (Yang, X., Matsuda, K., Bialek, P., Jacquot, S., Masuoka, H.

Runx2, the bone-specific product of the Cbfa1 gene, is a runt domain-containing transcription factor that is essential for osteoblast and hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and bone formation during embryogenesis and postnatal life.

Runx2 is expressed in mesenchymal condensations during early development at embryonic day 11.5 and acts as an osteoblast differentiation factor (3Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

Although the importance of Runx2 in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation is well established, relatively less is known about how Runx2 is regulated.

An in vivo role for ATF4 in bone development was recently described using Atf4-deficient mice (31Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Skeletal preparations of Atf4–/– animals showed a marked reduction or delay in mineralization of bones including frontal and parietal bones, clavicles, and long bones. At birth, the delay of mineralization in the skull was still present as shown by widening of the fontanelles. Postnatally, Atf4-deficient mice have a severe reduction in bone volume and in the number and thickness of trabeculae that persists throughout life. Furthermore, Atf4-deficient mice have normal levels of Runx2 and Osterix, both required factors for osteoblast differentiation. However, the expression of both bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin, markers for terminally differentiated osteoblasts, was markedly reduced in Atf4-deficient osteoblasts. Although Atf4 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, ATF4 protein is present only in osteoblasts. This tissue specificity is explained by proteasome-mediated degradation of ATF4 in non-osteoblastic cells (32Yang X. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47109-47114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, its transcriptional effects on the bone-specific Ocn gene are mediated by binding to a specific cis-acting element known as OSE1. This element was previously shown to be of equal importance to OSE2, the binding site for Runx2, in stimulating Ocn expression. These observations clearly demonstrate that ATF4 is required for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation during development as well as postnatal life. However, the mechanism of action for ATF4 in bone remains poorly understood. This study determined the functional relationship between ATF4 and Runx2 by examination of their independent and mutual effects on osteoblast-specific Ocn expression and mOG2 promoter activity. As will be shown, ATF4 enhanced Runx2-dependent Ocn mRNA expression and mOG2 promoter activity. ATF4 and Runx2 cooperatively regulated Ocn transcription through interactions with OSE1 and OSE2 sites in the promoter. Furthermore, pull-down assays suggested that ATF4 and Runx2 form a functional complex. Deletion analysis of Runx2 identified two separate regions required for ATF4 binding and activation. Reagents—Tissue culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Rabbit anti-mouse ATF4 antibody (for Western blot analysis) was described previously (31Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Other reagents were obtained from the following sources. Rabbit anti-mouse ATF4 antibody (for immunoprecipitation) and rabbit anti-mouse Runx2 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), M2 antibody was from Sigma, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG were from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Cell Cultures—MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 (MC-4) cells contain high levels of Runx2 protein. These cells express osteoblast phenotypic marker genes and mineralize only after growth in ascorbic acid-containing medium (10Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This cell line was maintained in ascorbic acid-free α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and was not used beyond passage 15. C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts and COS-7 cells (from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Mouse Bone Marrow Stromal Cell (BMSC) Cultures—Isolation of mouse BMSCs was described previously (33Krebsbach P.H. Kuznetsov S.A. Satomura K. Emmons R.V. Rowe D.W. Robey P.G. Transplantation. 1997; 63: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Tibiae and femurs were isolated and the epiphyses were cut. Marrow was flushed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10–8 m dexamethasone into a 60-mm dish, and the cell suspension was aspirated up and down with a 20-gauge needle to break clumps of marrow. The cell suspension (marrow from 2 mice/flask) was then cultured in a T75 flask in the same media. After 10 days, the cells reached confluency and were ready for experiments. DNA Constructs—p657mOG2-luc, p6OSE2-luc, and p4OSE1-luc were previously described (34Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 35Jiang D. Franceschi R.T. Boules H. Xiao G. J. Biol.

Franceschi R.T. Boules H. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5329-5337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). p657mOG2OSE2mt-luc, which contains 2-bp substitution mutations in the two OSE2 sites at positions –135/–134 and –606/–605 (CCAAGAACA), respectively, was generated from p657mOG2-luc by PCR amplification using a QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. p657mOG2(OSE1 + 2)mt-luc, in which both the OSE1 site and the two OSE2 sites were mutated, was generated from p657mOG2OSE2mt-luc by PCR using the OSE1 mutation primers. pCMV/ATF4 was described previously (31Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G.

To generate pCMV/ATF4 expression plasmids expressing truncated forms of ATF4 (aa 1–333, aa 1–302, aa 1–276), a stop code (TAA, TAG, or TGA) that results in a premature stop of ATF4 protein at the indicated amino acid residues was introduced into ATF4 cDNA by PCR, as described above, using pCMV/ATF4 as a template. pCMV/Runx2 expression plasmids (wild type, aa 1–410, aa 1–330, aa 1–286, and aa 1–258) containing cDNAs encoding either wild type Runx2 or deletions under CMV promoter control were constructed by ligating the full-length or deletion Runx2 cDNAs into pCMV5. AdCMV/β-gal was previously described (5Yang S. Wei D. Wang D. Phimphilai M. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Full-length GST-Runx2 fusion protein expression vector was described previously (3Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Full-length GST-ATF4 fusion protein expression plasmid was constructed by subcloning the full-length ATF4 cDNA into the GST gene fusion vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) in correct reading frame. Adenovirus expressing ATF4 under the control of a CMV promoter (AdCMV/ATF4) was constructed by subcloning full-length ATF4 cDNA into pAdlox plasmid followed by cAMP-response element-mediated recombination, as previously described (36Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All sequences were verified by automatic DNA sequencing. Expression of ATF4 protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Transfections—Cells were plated on 35-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection contained 0.25 μg of the indicated reporter plasmids plus 0.01 μg of pRL-SV40, containing a cDNA for Renilla reniformis luciferase to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested and assayed using the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (BD Biosciences). Adenovirus Infection of Osteoblasts—MC3T3-E1 cells or primary mouse BMSCs were transduced with AdCMV/β-gal or AdCMV/ATF4. The indicated titer of virus was added to the cells in 1% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The dishes were rotated every 5 min for the first 15 min to ensure that all of the cells were exposed to the virus. After 1 h, the medium was aspirated and cultures were rinsed twice with serum-free medium, and then fresh medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the dishes. RNA Analysis—RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Aliquots were fractionated on 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper, as described by Thomas (37Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). The mouse Ocn cDNA probe used for hybridization was obtained from Dr. John Wozney (38Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Bueker J.L. Kriz R. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) (Genetics Institute, Boston, MA). The cDNA inserts were excised from plasmid DNA with the appropriate restriction enzymes and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis before labeling with α-[32P]dCTP using a random primer kit (Roche Applied Science). Hybridizations were performed as previously described using a Bellco Autoblot hybridization oven (39Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The blots were then reprobed for loading using cDNA probe to 18 S rRNA. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts or nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (40Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuel, Keene, NH). Primary antibody (ATF4 antibody, Runx2 antibody, or M2 antibody) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG) was used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Blocking and reaction with antibodies was conducted as previously described (6Xiao G. Jiang D. Gopalakrishnan R. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36181-36187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity was determined using the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts were precleaned twice with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 30 min followed by pelleting of the beads. 5–10 μg of respective antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The immune complexes were collected by the addition of 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. Precipitates were washed five times with 1× washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the immunoprecipitated complexes were suspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using the indicated antibodies. ATF4 Stimulates Ocn Expression and Promoter Activity in Osteoblasts—Atf4-null mice exhibit markedly reduced expression of osteoblast marker genes, such as those encoding osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein, indicating that ATF4 is critical for osteoblast-specific gene expression (31Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). However, the direct effects of ATF4 over expression have not been previously examined. To test this, we studied the effect of ATF4 on mouse Ocn expression in MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 (MC-4) cells. MC-4 cells were infected with AdCMV/β-gal and/or AdCMV/ATF4 vectors. After 48 h, the cells were harvested for RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis using Ocn cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 1, overexpression of ATF4 increased Ocn mRNA in MC-4 cells in a dose-dependent manner. To determine the effect of ATF4 on mOG2 promoter activity, MC-4 cells were transiently transfected with p657mOG2-luc (reporter) and pRL-SV40 (for normalization) in the presence or absence of ATF4 expression plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were harvested for dual luciferase assay. Firefly luciferase was normalized to R. reniformis luciferase to control the transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 2A, ATF4 stimulated the 647-bp mOG2 promoter activity in MC-4 cells. However, introduction of a mutation of the OSE1 core sequence TTACATTA to TTAGTACA in the context of either 657-bp mOG2 promoter completely abolished ATF4 stimulation. Furthermore, an artificial promoter containing four copies of OSE1 fused to a –34 to +13 minimal mOG2 promoter (p4OSE1-luc) was also stimulated by ATF4, whereas the same construct containing mutated OSE1 was not in MC-4 cells (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained in primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Gel mobility shift assay revealed that nuclear extracts from MC-4 cells and COS-7 cells overexpressing ATF4 formed a complex with intact OSE1 DNA that was supershifted with an anti-ATF4 antibody but not by control IgG. This complex was not formed with mutant OSE1 DNA (data not shown).Fig. 2ATF4 increases mOG2 promoter activity in osteoblasts. MC-4 cells were transiently transfected with p657mOG2-luc (A) or p4OSE1-luc (B) and pRL-SV40 in the presence or absence of the pCMV/ATF4 expression plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were harvested for dual luciferase assay. BMSCs were first transfected with p657mOG2-luc (C) or p4OSE1-luc (D) and pRL-SV40. After 12 h, the cells were infected with 200 plaque-forming units/cell AdCMV/β-gal or AdCMV/ATF4. After 48 h, the cells were harvested for dual luciferase assay. Firefly luciferase was normalized to R. reniformis luciferase to control the transfection efficiency. wt, wild type; mt, mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATF4 Stimulation of Mouse Ocn Expression Is Runx2-dependent—Studies with Atf4 knock-out mice clearly demonstrated that ATF4 is required for osteoblast-specific Ocn and Bsp expression (31Yang X. Matsuda K. Bialek P. Jacquot S. Masuoka H.C. Schinke T. Li L. Brancorsini S. Sassone-Corsi P. Townes T.M. Hanauer A. Karsenty G. Cell. 2004; 117: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as shown above, overexpression of ATF4 in both MC-4 cells and BMSCs stimulated endogenous Ocn mRNA expression and mOG2 promoter activity. Both cell types are in the osteoblast lineage and are known to contain the osteoblast-related transcription factor Runx2, a master regulator for osteoblast and hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and bone formation. One important question to ask is: can ATF4 also stimulate endogenous Ocn expression in cells that do not contain Runx2 protein? To address this question, we determined the functional relationship between ATF4 and Runx2 by examination of their independent and mutual effects on Ocn expression and promoter activity in non-osteoblastic cells that lack a significant amount of Runx2 protein. As shown in Fig. 3A, C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with β-gal expression plasmid exhibited a very low basal level of Ocn mRNA. As previously demonstrated (3Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 5Yang S. Wei D. Wang D. Phimphilai M. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), Runx2 alone increased endogenous Ocn expression, consistent with its role as a master gene of osteoblast differentiation. Surprisingly and in contrast to the results from osteoblasts and BMSCs, ATF4 alone did not significantly stimulate Ocn mRNA in 10T1/2 cells. However, ATF4 dramatically increased the Ocn message level when Runx2 protein was co-expressed. Similarly, ATF4 stimulation of the 657-bp mOG2 promoter in COS-7 cells was also Runx2-dependent (Fig. 3B). Importantly, co-expression of ATF4 did not increase the protein levels of Runx2 (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that ATF4 stimulation of Ocn is dependent on the presence of Runx2 protein. ATF4 and Runx2 Cooperatively Regulate mOG2 Promoter Activity—The 657-bp mOG2 promoter contains a single ATF4-binding site (OSE1) at –48/–55 and two Runx2-binding sites (OSE2) at –131/–137 and –602/–608 (see schematic in Fig. 4A). Previous studies show that both the OSE1 and the two OSE2 sites in the mOG2 promoter are required for osteobl"

PLCζ is the smallest known mammalian PLC isozyme, comprising two EF hand domains, a C2 domain, and the catalytic X and Y core domains. To gain insight into PLCζ structure-function, we assessed the ability of PLCζ and a series of domain-deletion constructs to cause phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis in vitro and also to generate cytoplasmic Ca2+ changes in intact mouse eggs. PLCζ and the closely related PLCδ1 had similar Km values for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, but PLCζ was around 100 times more sensitive to Ca2+ than was PLCδ1. Notably, specific phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis activity was retained in PLCζ constructs that had either EF hand domains or the C2 domain removed, or both. In contrast, Ca2+ sensitivity was greatly reduced when either one, or both, of the EF hand domains were absent, and the Hill coefficient was reduced upon deletion of the C2 domain. Microinjection into intact mouse eggs revealed that all domain-deletion constructs were ineffective at initiating Ca2+ oscillations.

These data suggest that the exquisite Ca2+-dependent features of PLCζ regulation are essential for it to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca2+ oscillations in intact mouse eggs. A series of pre-programmed biochemical events are triggered during fertilization. The earliest signaling event in the activation of an egg by a sperm is a large, transient increase in intracellular free calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) (1Stricker S.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 2Runft L.L. Jaffe L.A. Mehlmann L.M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 245: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In many nonmammalian species, such as sea urchin, the observed Ca2+ increase in the egg comprises a single transient, but in mammals and some marine invertebrates there is a series of repetitive Ca2+ oscillations (3Miyazaki S. Shirakawa H. Nakada K. Honda Y. Dev. Biol. 1993; 58: 62-78Crossref Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 4Swann K. Ozil J.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 152: 183-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The frequency and duration of these Ca2+ oscillations vary between species (1Stricker S.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In response to this Ca2+ signal, the fertilized egg completes meiosis and initiates the process of embryonic development (5Lawrence Y. Ozil J.P. Swann K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C; PI-PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PH, pleckstrin homology. 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C; PI-PLC, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PH, pleckstrin homology. signaling pathway (6Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar) as the origin of the Ca2+ signals in mammalian eggs. IP3 is produced by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in a reaction that is catalyzed by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase (PI-PLC) (6Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar). Liberated IP3 then causes Ca2+ release by binding to IP3 receptors located on the endoplasmic reticulum of eggs and oocytes (7Rice A. Parrington J. Jones K. Swann K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Wu H. Smyth J. Luzzi V. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Black S. Allbritton N. Fissore R. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1338-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The essential role of IP3 and the IP3 receptor in fertilization is illustrated by studies in mouse and hamster eggs, where Ca2+ oscillations at fertilization can be inhibited by microinjection of antibodies that inhibit the IP3 receptor (9Miyazaki S. Yuzaki M. Nakada K. Shirakawa H. Nakanishi S. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1992; 257: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) or by down-regulation of IP3 receptors (10Parrington J.

Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that sustained injection of IP3, the repeated photorelease of caged IP3, or the microinjection of the IP3 analogue adenophostin can all lead to a series of Ca2+ oscillations in eggs (8Wu H. Smyth J. Luzzi V. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Black S. Allbritton N. Fissore R. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1338-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Swann K.

Hence, in mammalian eggs, IP3 is both necessary and potentially sufficient to explain the Ca2+ oscillations observed at fertilization. However, the precise mechanism employed by a sperm to generate an IP3 increase in the egg is not established. In mammalian eggs there is evidence for the existence of different types of PI-PLCs. The stimulation of egg-derived PLC isoforms of the β or γ class by receptor tyrosine kinases (14Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schelssinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) or by guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) (15Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) can lead to Ca2+ release in different species of eggs. However, there is evidence that neither the tyrosine kinase nor the G-protein pathways are necessary for Ca2+ release at fertilization in mouse eggs (2Runft L.L. Jaffe L.A. Mehlmann L.M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 245: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In contrast to classical transmembrane receptor signaling, there is evidence that mammalian eggs can be activated by a sperm protein component that is introduced into the egg after gamete membrane fusion (1Stricker S.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 4Swann K. Ozil J.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 152: 183-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Egg microinjection of sperm extracts, or whole sperm, triggers Ca2+ oscillations similar to fertilization in a range of different species (17Swann K.

Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The injection of such a sperm factor also activates the development of eggs and hence could represent the physiological agent that triggers egg activation and embryo development at fertilization (24Fujimoto S. Yoshida N. Fukui T. Amanai M. Isobe T. Itagaki C. Izumi T. Perry A.F.C. Dev. Biol. 2004; 274: 370-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the ability of soluble mammalian sperm extracts to cause Ca2+ oscillations can be explained by the presence of a sperm-specific PLC activity (25Jones K.T. Matsuda M. Parrington J. Katan M. Swann K. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Parrington J. Jones M.L. Tunwell R. Davader C. Katan M. Swann K. Reproduction. 2002; 123: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This activity was shown to be due to a novel mammalian PI-PLC, phospholipase Cζ (PLCζ), that we isolated from a spermatid cDNA library (27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection of cRNA encoding the mouse (27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), human, and cynomolgus monkey PLCζ (28Cox L.J. Larman M.G. Saunders C.M. Hashimoto K. Swann K. Lai F.A. Reproduction. 2002; 124: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) into mouse eggs triggered Ca2+ oscillations similar to those observed at fertilization. Furthermore, Ca2+ oscillations are abolished when PLCζ is immunodepleted from native sperm extracts (27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study showed that microinjection of recombinant PLCζ, synthesized using a baculovirus expression system, could also trigger Ca2+ oscillations in mouse eggs (29Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). One unusual feature of PLCζ is that it is effective at causing Ca2+ oscillations in eggs at very low concentrations (e.g. 10 fg/egg) (24Fujimoto S. Yoshida N. Fukui T. Amanai M. Isobe T. Itagaki C. Izumi T. Perry A.F.C. Dev. Biol. 2004; 274: 370-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies have shown that PLC isoforms of the β, γ, or δ class are either ineffective (25Jones K.T. Matsuda M. Parrington J. Katan M. Swann K. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or at least much less effective than PLCζ at causing Ca2+ release when microinjected into eggs (2Runft L.L. Jaffe L.A. Mehlmann L.M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 245: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 29Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 236: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The specific reasons why sperm PLCζ is much more effective than other PLC isoforms at causing Ca2+ oscillations in eggs are currently unknown. The unique functional features of PLCζ may be attributable to its distinct domain structure. There are five subfamilies of PI-PLCs (β, γ, δ, ϵ, and ζ) classified on the basis of their sequence homology (27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rhee S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). The regions of greatest sequence identity are the X and Y domains, which form the active site for enzymatic cleavage of PIP2 in all PI-PLCs. In addition, all isoforms have in common a C2 domain, which binds to lipids such as phosphatidylserine. In studies with PI-PLCδ1, the C2 domain has been suggested to orientate the enzyme to the membrane containing PIP2, and this association is Ca2+-dependent (31Rhee S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). PI-PLCs also contain EF hands, but the role of these Ca2+ binding domains in PLC isozymes is not clear. These domains usually bind one Ca2+ ion each, although variants that do not bind Ca2+ ions have been identified (31Rhee S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 32Katan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PLCζ is most closely related to PLCδ but is distinct in that it lacks a PH domain (Fig. 1A), a common feature present in most PI-PLCs (27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PH domain characteristically targets the PLC to phosphoinositides or other regulatory proteins such as G-protein βγ subunits in the plasma membrane (31Rhee S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 32Katan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 33Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The aim of this study is to examine the importance of the EF hand and C2 domains with respect to PLCζ enzymatic activity in vitro and their involvement in initiating Ca2+ oscillations in eggs. A series of recombinant PLCζ domain-deletion constructs were prepared, together with the well characterized PLCδ1 (34Katan M. Williams R.L. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Williams R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) for comparison, and were tested by using an in vitro PLC activity assay (hydrolysis of PIP2) and also an in situ assay by microinjection into eggs of the corresponding cRNA constructs (Ca2+ oscillations). Our studies show that although the XY catalytic domain is minimally sufficient for in vitro enzymatic hydrolysis of PIP2, all of the disparate domains, i.e. EF hands and C2 domains, are required for PLCζ to initiate the trademark Ca2+ oscillations observed in mammalian eggs upon fertilization by sperm. Cloning of PLCζ, PLCδ1, and Deletion Constructs—Mouse PLCζ and a series of domain-deletion constructs were amplified by PCR from the original cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession number AF435950), using Pfu polymerase and the appropriate primers to incorporate a 5′-EcoRI site and a 3′-SalI site. PCR products were cloned into pGEX-5X2 (Amersham Biosciences). The following primers were used for each construct: for full-length PLCζ, 5′-AATCGAATTCTCATGGAAAGCCAACTTCATGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATGGTCGACATGCGTCACTCTCTGAAGTA-3′ (reverse); for ζΔEF1, 5′-ACCGGAATTCATATTTTTAAGGAAAATGAC-3′ (forward) and for ζΔEF1,2, 5′-ACCGGATTCGATACATGTTTTCATCAGAATGT-3′(forward). For the latter two constructs, the reverse primer was the same as that of full-length PLCζ stated above. For ζΔC2, the forward primer was the same as for full-length PLCζ and 5′-GATGGTCGACATATTCTGGTTAATTGGGGT-3′ (reverse); and for ζXY, the primers were ACCGGATTCGATACATGTTTTCATCAGAATGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATGGTCGACATATTCTGGTTAATTGGGGT-3′ (reverse). The rat PLCδ1 clone (GenBank™ accession number M20637) was kindly provided by M. Katan (Cancer Research UK, Centre for Cell and Molecular Biology, London, UK). Appropriate primers were designed to incorporate a 5′-SalI site and a 3′-NotI site at the ends of PLCδ1. PLCδ1 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-5X2 by using these restriction sites. The following primers were used for PLCδ1: 5′-CTTCGTCGACCATGGACTCGGGTAGGGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACCGCGGCCGCTTAGTCCTGGATGGAGATCTTC-3′ (reverse); for ΔPHδ1 the forward primer was 5′-TTCGTCGACTGGGCTCCATGGACCAGCGGCAGAAGC-3′(forward) and reverse primer was the same as for full-length PLCδ1. For ΔPH-PLCδ1 the primers incorporated a 5′-EcoRI site, TTCAGAATTCCCATGGACTCGGGTAGGGACTT-3′ (forward), and a 3′-SalI site, 5′-TGTCGACCAGCCTTTCGCAAGCAGGAGTGAAT-3′ (reverse). Each of the above expression vector constructs was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Prism Big Dye kit; ABI Prism® 3100 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). For quantitation of expression of microinjected cRNAs in mouse oocytes, PLCδ1, PLCζ, and various deletion constructs were tagged via their C termini with firefly luciferase. PCR amplification of the PLCs was performed with the original templates, described above, using Pfu polymerase. PLCζ constructs were amplified using a 5′ primer incorporating an EcoRI site and a 3′ primer that ablated the stop codon and created a NotI site. PLCδ1 was amplified using a 5′ primer containing a SalI site and a 3′ primer that removed the stop codon and incorporated a NotI site. PCR products were cloned into pCR3 (Invitrogen) via the appropriate restriction sites. The luciferase open reading frame was amplified from pGL2 (Promega) with primers incorporating NotI sites, and the product was cloned into the NotI site of the pCR3-PLC vector. Each construct was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing, as described above. cRNA was generated as described below, using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion) and polyadenylated using the poly(A) tailing kit (Ambion), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Protein Expression and Purification—For bacterial expression of GST fusion proteins, Escherichia coli (BL21 or Rosetta cells, Novagen) was transformed with the appropriate pGEX-5X-2 construct and cultured at 30 °C until the A600 reached 0.5, and then protein expression was induced for 4 h at 25°C with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Promega). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and then sonicated three times for 20 s on ice. After 15 min of centrifugation at 15,000 × g, 4 °C, soluble GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (GS4B) beads following standard procedures (Amersham Biosciences). Eluted proteins were dialyzed overnight (Pierce; SnakeSkin 10,000 molecular weight cut-off) at 4 °C against 4 liters of PBS, then concentrated with centrifugal concentrators, and stored at -80 °C in buffer containing 40% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Assay of PLC Activity—PIP2 hydrolytic activity of recombinant PLCδ1, PLCζ, and their deletion constructs was assayed as described previously (36Katan M. Parker J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The final volume of the assay mixture was 50 μl containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.4% sodium cholate (w/v), 2 mm CaCl2, 4 mm EGTA, 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. The final concentration of PIP2 in the reaction mixture was 220 μm, containing 0.05 μCi of [3H]PIP2. The assay conditions were optimized for linearity, requiring a 10-min incubation of 20 pmol of PLC protein sample at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 0.25 ml of chloroform/methanol/concentrated HCl (100:100:0.6 v/v) followed by 0.075 ml of concentrated HCl. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min, and then 0.2 ml of the upper aqueous phase was removed and added to 10 ml of Optiphase “Hisafe 3” scintillation mixture (Wallac), and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrofluorimetry (Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR). In assays to determine dependence on PIP2 concentration, 0.05 μCi of [3H]PIP2 was mixed with cold PIP2 to give the appropriate final concentration. In assays examining the Ca2+ sensitivity, Ca2+ buffers were prepared by EGTA/CaCl2 admixture, as described previously (37Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 457-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In the assays to monitor pH dependence of the PLCs, Tris-HCl buffers were prepared over the range of pH 5.2-8.6. cRNA Synthesis and in Vitro Translation—Full-length mouse PLCζ and the domain-deletion constructs used for RNA synthesis were amplified by PCR from the original clone cDNA using appropriate primers and Pfu polymerase, as described above. PCR products were cloned into pCR-Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen), sequence-verified, and then subcloned into the pTarget vector (Promega). cRNAs encoding the wild type PLC and deletion constructs were produced from the linearized pTarget constructs using the Ribomax RNA synthesis kit (Promega) in the presence of 3 mm m7G(5′ppp(5′)G (37 °C, 2 h). Synthesized cRNA products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, isopropyl alcohol-precipitated, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water containing 4 units of RNasin μl-1 (Promega). Integrity of complementary RNAs were assayed by in vitro expression of proteins (Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, as described previously (27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation and Handling of Gametes—Experiments were carried out with mouse eggs in Hepes-buffered saline (H-KSOM) as described previously (38Summers M.C. McGinnis L.K.M. Lawitts J.A. Raffin M. Biggers J.D. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 15: 1791-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All compounds were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Female mice were superovulated by injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin (Intervet). Eggs were collected 13.5-14.5 h later (5Lawrence Y. Ozil J.P. Swann K. Biochem.

Microinjection of the eggs was carried out 14.5-15.5 h after human chorionic gonadotrophin injection (27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection and Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ and Luciferase Expression—Mouse eggs were washed in H-KSOM and microinjected as described previously (27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with cRNA diluted in injection buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The volume injected was estimated from the diameter of cytoplasmic displacement caused by the bolus injection. All injections were 3-5% of the egg volume. In experiments with untagged PLCζ, Ca2+ changes were monitored with a CCD-based imaging system using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope, with illumination from a monochromator (Photonics) controlled by MetaFluor version 4.0 (Universal Imaging Corp.). Eggs were loaded for 10 min with 4 μm Fura Red-AM (Molecular Probes) and dissolved in Me2SO + 5% (w/v) pluronic acid, and the loading medium was supplemented with sulfinpyrazone, which helps prevent compartmentalization and extrusion of the dye (5Lawrence Y. Ozil J.P. Swann K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For experiments with luciferase-tagged PLCζ, eggs were microinjected with the appropriate cRNA mixed with an equal volume of 1 mm Oregon Green BAPTA dextran (Molecular Probes) in KCl Hepes buffer. Eggs were then maintained in H-KSOM with 100 μm luciferin and imaged on a Nikon TE2000 or Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope equipped with a cooled intensified CCD camera (Photek Ltd., UK). Ca2+ was monitored in these eggs for 4 h after injection by measuring the Oregon Green BAPTA dextran fluorescence with low level excitation light from a halogen lamp. At the end of Ca2+ measurements, the same set of eggs was then monitored for luminescence by integrating light emission (in the absence of fluorescence excitation) for 20 min using the same intensified CCD camera. The fluorescence signals were typically 10-100 times greater than the luminescence signals. Ca2+ measurements for an egg were considered valid only if the same egg was also luminescent. Groups of eggs verified as being luminous were then collected and placed in a test tube containing PBS with 1 mm MgATP + 100 μm luciferin, which was held in a custom-made luminometer equipped with a cooled S20 photomultiplier tube (Electron Tubes Ltd., UK). The eggs were then lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100, and the steady state light was compared with that emitted from calibrated amounts of recombinant firefly luciferase (Sigma). The amount of luciferase activity measured for each group of eggs was then divided by the number of luminous eggs to obtain the mean value for protein expression of each type of luc-PLCζ. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Recombinant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, incubated overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% nonfat milk powder, and probed with anti-GST polyclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution). Detection of horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody was achieved using Super Signal West Dura (Pierce) and a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc gel documentation system for image capture. Expression and Enzymatic Characterization of Recombinant PLCζ—PLCδ1 and PLCζ were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified by GST affinity chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Empirically determined, optimal protein production required maintaining bacterial cultures at 37 °C until A600 of 0.5-0.6, followed by induction of protein expression upon addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 4 h of vigorous shaking at 25 °C. Fig. 1A schematically depicts the distinct domains of PLCδ1 and PLCζ and illustrates their close similarity because of common structural features, specifically the two EF hands, catalytic X and Y domains, and C2 domain, with the notable exception of an N-terminal PH domain absent from PLCζ (27Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the GST affinity-purified recombinant proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and immunoblot detection using an anti-GST antibody. The predicted molecular mass, including the GST tag (26 kDa), for GST-PLCδ1 and GST-PLCζ was 111 and 100 kDa, respectively. The corresponding proteins with appropriate molecular mass were observed as the top band in both Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and on the immunoblot (Fig. 1B). The lowest band of 26 kDa is consistent with cleaved GST, which along with the much fainter intermediate molecular mass bands detected by the anti-GST antibody are probably the result of protein degradation occurring through the bacterial expression and purification processes.

This study was conducted to examine the role of the JAK/STAT pathway in neurons in response to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which play a major role during neurodegeneration, and to study their effect on expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3), belonging to the novel family of feedback regulators of cytokine and growth factor activities. In this report, we showed that TNFα is inhibitory to the survival of primary cortical neurons at higher doses and that IGF-1 can rescue TNFα-stimulated cell death. We showed that the JAK/STAT pathway is involved in this rescue as tyrphostin AG490, a specific inhibitor of JAK/STAT, completely inhibits cell survival in response to IGF-1. STAT3 gets tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in response to IGF-1. Northern blot, semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and real time PCR experiments demonstrated that the JAK/STAT pathway also up-regulated SOCS-3 mainly in response to IGF-1. SOCS-3 associated with the IGF receptor and blocked further STAT3 activation. To our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrated the importance of the JAK/STAT pathway and the role of SOCS-3 in the survival of neurons in response to IGF-1. We have subsequently shown that SOCS-3 overexpression, on one hand, leads to neuroblastoma cell death and on the other hand leads to primary cell differentiation, indicating the involvement of SOCS-3 in cell survival and differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2118013877,"Host cell invasion is an essential step during infection by Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular protozoan that causes the severe opportunistic disease toxoplasmosis in humans. Recent evidence strongly suggests that proteins discharged from Toxoplasma apical secretory organelles (micronemes, dense granules, and rhoptries) play key roles in host cell invasion and survival during infection. However, to date, only a limited number of secretory proteins have been discovered, and the full spectrum of effector molecules involved in parasite invasion and survival remains unknown. To address these issues, we analyzed a large cohort of freely released Toxoplasma secretory proteins by using two complementary methodologies, two-dimensional electrophoresis/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MudPIT, shotgun proteomics). Visualization of Toxoplasma secretory products by two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed ∼100 spots, most of which were successfully identified by protein microsequencing or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. Many proteins were present in multiple species suggesting they are subjected to substantial post-translational modification. Shotgun proteomic analysis of the secretory fraction revealed several additional products, including novel putative adhesive proteins, proteases, and hypothetical secretory proteins similar to products expressed by other related parasites including Plasmodium, the etiologic agent of malaria. A subset of novel proteins were re-expressed as fusions to yellow fluorescent protein, and this initial screen revealed shared and distinct localizations within secretory compartments of T. gondii tachyzoites.

These findings provided a uniquely broad view of Toxoplasma secretory proteins that participate in parasite survival and pathogenesis during infection. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is a human pathogen that causes severe opportunistic disease (toxoplasmosis) in congenitally infected babies and immunocompromised individuals (e.g. AIDS) (1Dubey J.P. J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 1994; 205: 1593-1598PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dubey J.P. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although foodborne transmission via ingestion of infected meat products contributes to the steady rise in age-dependent seroprevalence, waterborne transmission of the highly infectious, feline-derived oocyst stage has led to recent outbreaks (3Aramini J.J.

Alves C.C. Orefice F. Addiss D.G. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2003; 9: 55-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of waterborne transmission and the availability of drug-resistant strains have raised awareness of toxoplasmosis as a threat to public health from natural outbreaks or the potential malicious contamination of public water sources. Because effective control of outbreak situations will be enhanced by having multiple options for the diagnosis and treatment, the identification and exploitation of novel parasite targets is of acute importance. T. gondii belongs to phylum Apicomplexa, which also includes several other notable pathogens such as Plasmodium (the agents of malaria), Cryptosporidium (the cause of cryptosporidiosis), and Eimeria (the cause of coccidiosis). For several aspects of apicomplexan biology, Toxoplasma is emerging as a important model organism (5Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 415-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) because it exhibits many of the features and capabilities that define the phylum, yet it is more amenable to experimental manipulation than many of its kin. Toxoplasma is an obligate intracellular parasite and must invade a vertebrate host cell for survival and replication. Invasion initiates the lytic cycle leading to the cell and tissue destruction that is a hallmark feature of Toxoplasma pathology. Toxoplasma invasion is a rapid (<30 s), dynamic, and complex process that relies on the secretion of numerous secretory proteins from specialized secretory organelles, including micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules (6Carruthers V.B. Acta Trop. 2002; 81: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that sequential secretions of these secretory proteins are critical events in parasite invasion and establishment of infection (7Leriche M.A. Dubremetz J.F. Parasitol. Res. 1990; 76: 359-362Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar).

Soldati D.S. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 81-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Next, the contents of rhoptries are discharged and are thought to be critical for biogenesis of the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that envelops the parasite during invasion and its interaction with host cellular organelles (10Sinai A. Webster J.P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nakaar V. Ngo H.M. Aaronson E.P. Coppens I. Stedman T.T. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2311-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Finally, dense granules proteins (DGs) are exocytosed both during and after invasion and are thought to function in intracellular survival and replication (12Carey K.L. Donahue C.G. Ward G.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Mercier C. Dubremetz J.F. Rauscher B. Lecordier L. Sibley L.D. Cesbron-Delauw M.F. Mol. Biol.

Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also suggested that the parasite releases products capable of manipulating the host immune response (15Blader I.J. Manger I.D. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24223-24231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 16Aliberti J. Valenzuela J.G. Carruthers V.B. Hieny S. Andersen J. Charest H. Reis e Sousa C. Fairlamb A. Ribeiro J.M. Sher A. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 485-490Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Also, secretory products and surface antigens (SAGs) have received scrutiny as promising diagnostic markers (17Suzuki Y. Ramirez R. Press C. Li S. Parmley S. Thulliez P. Remington J.S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 3967-3970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jacobs D. Vercammen M. Saman E. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1999; 6: 24-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this progress, only a limited number of secretory proteins have been discovered to date. This point is underscored by the recent bioinformatic identification of >800 genes encoding proteins with a putative secretory signal peptide (www.toxodb.org), yet fewer than 30 Toxoplasma secretory proteins have been described to date. Although many of the putative secretory proteins may be retained in internal compartments such as the ER/Golgi or apicoplast (a plastid like organelle), a significant fraction is probably exported to external sites for interaction with the host. The recent coupling of high resolution protein separation techniques (two-dimensional electrophoresis or multichromatography) with high throughput identification strategies has permitted the wide scale analysis of protein identity, expression, modification, localization, and interactions within whole cells or subcellular fractions (19Graves P.R. Haystead T.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 39-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 20Aebersold R. Mann M. Nature. 2003; 422: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). With these tools, it is possible to analyze a multitude of cellular proteins from a more global perspective. The recent completion of parasite genome projects (21Ersfeld K. Curr. Issues Mol.

Proteomics. 2003; 2: 146-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The Toxoplasma genome is nearing completion, and two studies have described preliminary mapping and partial identification of the tachyzoite (a rapidly dividing form of the parasite) proteins, either by two-dimensional electrophoresis immunoblotting (29Dlugonska H. Dytnerska K. Reichmann G. Stachelhaus S. Fischer H.G. Parasitol. Res. 2001; 87: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or by two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-MS (30Cohen A.M. Rumpel K. Coombs G.H. Wastling J.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although these studies provided a valuable initial view of the protein complement for the parasite, a relatively small subset of the Toxoplasma proteome was examined. Here we use complementary approaches to examine a cohort of excreted/secreted antigens (ESA) freely released by Toxoplasma tachyzoites, the life stage responsible for the tissue pathology observed in toxoplasmosis. Our findings reveal that Toxoplasma mobilizes a rich assortment of putative effector molecules that may interact with the host during infection. These include adhesins that presumably contribute to attachment and penetration, proteases that may facilitate invasion or migration into host tissues, metabolic enzymes potentially involved in nutrient acquisition, and a series of hypothetical proteins of unknown function. These findings significantly widen the viewing aperture of the molecular players contributing to Toxoplasma survival and pathogenesis during infection. Reagents and Chemicals—Porcine trypsin (sequencing grade) was from Promega (Madison, WI). MS calibration mixture II (peptide mass standard kit) was from Applied Biosystems (Framingham, MA). One-dimensional electrophoresis and two-dimensional electrophoresis reagents and immobilized IEF strips were from Bio-Rad or Amersham Biosciences. The MALDI matrix, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, was purchased from Sigma. All the organic solvents are HPLC grade. All other reagents and chemicals were obtained from either Fisher or Sigma and were of the highest purity available. Cell Culture and Large Scale ESA Preparation—Parasite culture and ESA preparation were performed according to Ref. 31Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar. Briefly, T. gondii strain 2F was propagated in human foreskin fibroblast cells. Freshly egressed tachyzoites were harvested by passage twice through a 20-gauge needle followed by filtration through a 3-μm pore size membrane to remove host cell debris. Parasites were washed twice by centrifugation in D0 medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES). Large scale preparation of ESA proteins was performed by incubating ∼4 × 109 filter-purified tachyzoites in 15 ml of D0 plus 1% (v/v) ethanol at 37 °C for 20 min followed by cooling on ice for 5 min. Parasites were removed by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant, which was supplemented with a mixture of proteinase inhibitors, was concentrated to ∼400 μl using C-20 concentrators according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Billerica, MA). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—ESA proteins were separated in the first dimension on 11- or 18-cm immobilized dry strips (pH 3-10, pH 4-7) using an isoelectric focusing system (Amersham Biosciences or Bio-Rad). 120 μg of ESA protein was mixed with rehydration buffer containing 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% carrier ampholytes buffer, and 65 mm dithiothreitol. Rehydration and isoelectric focusing were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following isoelectric focusing, proteins were reduced and alkylated by successive 15-min treatments with equilibration buffer containing 2% dithiothreitol followed by 2.5% iodoacetamide. Proteins were then resolved in the second dimension on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12.5% homogenous gel for the Amersham Biosciences system, 10-20% gradient gel for Bio-Rad). Resolved proteins were either transferred directly to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N-terminal sequencing or stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue stain (32Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for MALDI-MS analysis. N-terminal Sequencing—Proteins on a two-dimensional electrophoresis gel were transferred to Immobilon® PSQ membranes (Millipore) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Bands were excised and subjected to Edman degradation on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 477A gas-phase protein sequencer. In-gel Digestion, Peptide Extraction, MALDI-MS Analysis, and Data Base Searching—Protein spots from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels were excised, in-gel digested with trypsin (12.5 ng μl-1 in 50 mm NH4HCO3), and solvent-extracted as described previously (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7487) Google Scholar). After extraction, peptide mixtures were dried down and re-dissolved in 2 μl of 50% acetonitrile and 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, mixed with saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (matrix) solution, and deposited on the MALDI-MS target plate according to a general two-layer method (34Onnerfjord P. Ekstrom S. Bergquist J. Nilsson J. Laurell T. Marko-Varga G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The MS analysis of digested peptides was performed with a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The spectra were acquired in the reflection-positive mode with delayed extraction, and external peptides or proteins adjacent to the sample spots were used for MS calibration. Internal calibration was refined using selected trypsin autolysis ions. Peptide monoisotopic masses were used to search against Toxoplasma NCBI data base via the MS-Fit algorithm (prospector.ucsf.edu) or to search Toxoplasma protein/EST/genome data bases via an in-house installed Mascot program (35Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, a mass tolerance of ±50 ppm was allowed in the data base searches. Generally, a minimum number of four peptide matches, sequence coverage of at least 15%, and a match to a T. gondii entry were required for true positive match when using MS-fit algorithm, whereas a score higher than the Mascot significant score was regarded as positive match in Mascot data base searches. MudPIT Analysis and Protein Identification—Lyophilized ESA proteins were reconstituted in 1 ml of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate solution. The proteins were reduced by adding 10 μl of dithiothreitol (1 m) and incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. Cysteines were alkylated by adding 10 μl of iodoacetic acid (1 m in 1 n NaOH) and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. The sample was spun through a Microcon YM-3 concentrator until dry and resuspended in 1 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer for trypsin digestion. The digested ESA peptide mixtures were buffer-exchanged into 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid prior to analysis. The MudPIT experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on a ProteomeX work station (Thermo-Finnigan, San Jose, CA), which is composed of an autosampler, two HPLC pumps, a 10-port column-switching valve, and a Deca-XP ion trap mass spectrometer with a micro-ESI interface. For one-dimensional MudPIT, HPLC separation of peptide mixtures was conducted through reverse phase chromatography only, whereas for two-dimensional MudPIT, the HPLC separation was performed through ion exchange chromatography in the first dimension and then reverse phase chromatography in the second dimension. Specifically, in the case of two-dimensional MudPIT, peptides were bound to a strong cation exchanger (BioBasic SCX, 0.32 mm × 10 cm, Thermo Hypersil) and eluted stepwise with five NH4Cl concentrations (10, 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm, respectively). Peptides eluted from each salt step were further separated on a reverse phase capillary column (BioBasic C18, 300Å, 5 μm silica, 180 μm × 10 cm) using an acetonitrile gradient (0-60% solvent B in solvent A, A = 0.1% formic acid; B = 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid). The mass/charge (m/z) ratios of eluted peptides and fragmented ions were analyzed by an LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer. Following each full scan mass spectrum, two MS/MS spectra of the top two most intense peaks were acquired. The dynamic exclusion feature was enabled to obtain MS/MS spectra of co-eluted peptides. Protein identification was performed by searching the T. gondii protein subset of NCBI “nr,” the amino acid TgTwinScan gene predictions, and the clustered EST data bases using the TurboSequest algorithm (36Eng J.K. Mccormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (4999) Google Scholar) in the Bioworks 3.1 software package (Thermo Finnigan). The identified peptides were further evaluated using charge-state versus cross-correlation number (Xcorr). The criteria for positive identification of peptides were Xcorr >1.5 for singly charged ions, Xcorr >2.0 for doubly charged ions, and Xcorr >2.5 for triply charged ions (37Ducret A. Van Oostveen I. Eng J.K. Yates III, J.R. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 706-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low scoring peptide matches (Xcorr <1.9/2.2/3.1 for +1/+2/+3, respectively) were verified by manual inspection of MS/MS spectra. Additionally, only proteins with at least two peptides of distinct sequence identified were accepted. In Silico Analysis of Identified Proteins—All proteins identified by any of the three proteomic approaches were subjected to multiple in silico analyses. Predicted localization of proteins was assigned primarily through previously published localization and subsequently by several algorithms as follows: signal peptide (SignalP 3.0) (38Bendtsen J.D.

EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Proteins with predicted signal peptides were also analyzed for the presence of transmembrane domains (TMHMM) (42Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar) and GPI anchor sites (129.194.185.165/dgpi/index_en.html). Protein function was assigned based on published results. Novel proteins were assigned putative function if strong homology over long stretches of the protein (based on BLASTP with default settings against NCBI nonredundant data base) was found to a protein of known function. Ortholog Identification—To identify orthologs to ESA proteins, we followed the approach used to generate the TIGR orthologous gene alignments (TOGA) (43Lee Y. Sultana R. Pertea G. Cho J. Karamycheva S. Tsai J. Parvizi B. Cheung F. Antonescu V. White J. Holt I. Liang F. Quackenbush J. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ESA amino acid sequences were BLASTed against available apicomplexan TIGR gene indices (44Quackenbush J. Cho J. Lee D. Liang F. Holt I. Karamycheva S. Parvizi B. Pertea G. Sultana R. White J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 159-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using WUBLAST tblastn, and for sequence matches with E values of <10-5, the percent conservation of the best high scoring pair was recorded. Putative orthology was assigned if the reciprocal BLAST (blastx) using identical stringency against the Toxoplasma TgTwinScan amino acid gene predictions identified the original query as the top hit. As an alternative approach, we identified the protozoan OrthoMCL (45Li L. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Roos D.S. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2178-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar) ortholog clusters containing identified ESA proteins and retransformed the relative similarity scores among proteins into the original BLAST E values. Expression and Analysis of YFP Fusion Proteins—Several novel ESAs predicted to be in the secretory pathway were cloned using primers designed against the TgTwinScan gene predictions and C-terminally fused to YFP (in destYFP/sagCAT (46Gubbels M.J. Wieffer M. Striepen B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). Both extracellular and intracellular wild-type parasites were transiently transfected and grown in human foreskin fibroblast cells. Extracellular parasites were isolated by membrane filtration. Parasites were fixed in solution for 15 min with 2.5% formaldehyde, 0.02% glutaraldehyde and washed three times with PBS for 5 min, and extracellular parasites were permitted to settle on polylysine-coated chamber slides for 30 min. Slides were blocked with PBS, 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. For mitochondrial staining, isolated extracellular tachyzoites were incubated for 15 min in media containing Mitotracker Red (1:10,000, Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) before fixation. For immunofluorescence, slides were incubated with primary antibody in PBS, 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% normal goat serum for 60 min, washed, and stained with the appropriate Alexa-594-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (5 μgml-1, Sigma), washed again, and mounted using Mowiol. The following primary antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions: mouse monoclonal anti-GRA2 (Tg17-179; 1:400), rabbit anti-GRA7 (kind gift of Isabelle Coppens; 1:400), rabbit anti-ROP2 (kind gift of Con Beckers; 1:2000) for extracellular parasites, mouse monoclonal anti-ROP2,3,4 (T34A71C8; 1:1000), and mouse monoclonal anti-AMA1 antibody (B3.90; 1:1000). Images were captured under ×600 or ×1000 magnification using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a Spot RT CCD camera. Images were deconvoluted using SimplePCI (C-Imaging Systems, Cranberry Township, PA). Toxoplasma secretory products have been implicated in parasite entry, intracellular survival, and interaction with the host (reviewed in Ref. 47Carruthers V.B. Parasitol. Int. 1999; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Regardless of whether they are initially secreted in a soluble or membrane-associated form, many of these products ultimately accumulate in ESA as a result of proteolytic shedding from the parasite surface (48Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 49Garcia-Réguet N. Lebrun M. Fourmaux M.-N. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Mann T. Beckers C.J.M. Samyn B.

ESA proteins were recovered from the medium after stimulating parasite secretion with 1% ethanol treatment (51Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N.J. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To maximize ESA product discovery, we employed several strategies that are outlined in Fig. 1. The first approach was to separate proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with identification either by N-terminal sequencing (Fig. 1A), which was primarily used for alkaline proteins, or by MALDI-MS and peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) (Fig. 1B). The second approach was to use multidimensional liquid chromatography to separate tryptic peptides in line with ESI-MS/MS to acquire tandem MS data (Fig. 1C). ESA proteins were identified by matching the acquired N-terminal sequence, MALDI/PMF, or ESI-MS/MS data with sequences in the T. gondii subset of the NCBI nonredundant data base, T. gondii EST, or gene prediction (TgTwinScan) data bases using several search algorithms including BLAST, ProteinProspector (51Carruthers V.B.

A subset of the novel putative secretory proteins identified in these screens was then expressed in a YFP fusion construct to test for localization within the parasite secretory pathway. To view a wide profile of extracellular products, ESA proteins were initially resolved on broad pH range IEF strips (pH 3-10). Because only a minority of species occupied the alkaline"
https://openalex.org/W2112047426,"Comprehensive analyses of remote sensing data during the three-year effort to select the Mars Exploration Rover landing sites at Gusev crater and at Meridiani Planum correctly predicted the atmospheric density profile during entry and descent and the safe and trafficable surfaces explored by the two rovers. The Gusev crater site was correctly predicted to be a low-relief surface that was less rocky than the Viking landing sites but comparably dusty. A dark, low-albedo, flat plain composed of basaltic sand and haematite with very few rocks was expected and found at Meridiani Planum. These results argue that future efforts to select safe landing sites based on existing and acquired remote sensing data will be successful. In contrast, geological interpretations of the sites based on remote sensing data were less certain and less successful, which emphasizes the inherent ambiguities in understanding surface geology from remotely sensed data and the uncertainty in predicting exactly what materials will be available for study at a landing site. The cover shows part of the Larry's Lookout panorama, seen from the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Spirit during its drive up Husband Hill: the summit is about 200 metres from the rover. Six papers this week report in detail on the MER mission. An Analysis compares predictions used to select a landing site with the conditions actually encountered. This ‘ground truth’ will be invaluable for interpreting future remote-sensing data. Surface chemistry suggests that the upper layer of soil may contain 1% meteoritic material. MER provides a unique glimpse of solar transits of the moons Phobos and Deimos. Rover Opportunity examined wind-related processes, and spectroscopy indicates a dry origin for atmospheric dust. Features from within the Gusev crater give more information on the role of liquid water in Mars's past. An accompanying News and Views puts the MER data in context."
https://openalex.org/W1990750207,"The endoplasmic reticulum is the site of synthesis and folding of secretory proteins and is sensitive to changes in the internal and external environment of the cell. Both physiological and pathological conditions may perturb the function of the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress. The chondrocyte is the only resident cell found in cartilage and is responsible for synthesis and turnover of the abundant extracellular matrix and may be sensitive to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here we report that glucose withdrawal, tunicamycin, and thapsigargin induce up-regulation of GADD153 and caspase-12, two markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, in both primary chondrocytes and a chondrocyte cell line. Other agents such as interleukin-1β or tumor necrosis factor α induced a minimal or no induction of GADD153, respectively. The endoplasmic reticulum stress resulted in decreased chondrocyte growth based on cell counts, up-regulation of p21, and decreased PCNA expression. In addition, perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum function resulted in decreased accumulation of an Alcian Blue positive matrix by chondrocytes and decreased expression of type II collagen at the protein level. Further, quantitative real-time PCR was used to demonstrate a down-regulation of steady state mRNA levels coding for aggrecan, collagen II, and link protein in chondrocytes exposed to endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing conditions. Ultimately, endoplasmic reticulum stress resulted in chondrocyte apoptosis, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and annexin V staining. These findings have potentially important implications regarding consequences of endoplasmic reticulum stress in cartilage biology.

Ultimately, endoplasmic reticulum stress resulted in chondrocyte apoptosis, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and annexin V staining. These findings have potentially important implications regarding consequences of endoplasmic reticulum stress in cartilage biology. Cartilage is a connective tissue that serves multiple functions in the developing embryo and in postnatal life. The chondrocyte is the only resident cell found in cartilage and is responsible for both synthesis and turnover of the abundant extracellular matrix (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IL, interleukin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TN, tunicamycin; TG, thapsigargin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; PI, propidium iodide; fmk, fluoromethylketone; IRC, immortalized rat chondrocytes; SNP, sodium nitroprusside. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IL, interleukin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TN, tunicamycin; TG, thapsigargin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; PI, propidium iodide; fmk, fluoromethylketone; IRC, immortalized rat chondrocytes; SNP, sodium nitroprusside. During development, chondrocytes proliferate and secrete ECM forming the cartilage template of the skeleton (1Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). In the adult, the chondrocytes secrete and maintain ECM that plays a role in growth, mechanical support, and the function of diarthrodial joints between bones (2Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 3Archer C.W. Francis-West P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The chondrocytes reside in an ECM that is neither vascularized nor innervated, therefore nutrient and waste exchange occurs through diffusion under both normal and pathological conditions. The cartilage ECM is composed of collagenous proteins, mainly type II in hyaline cartilage, glycoproteins such as link protein, proteoglycans such as aggrecan, and glycosaminoglycans including chondroitin sulfate, heparin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid (4Eyre D.R. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1991; 21: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The precursors of these macromolecules are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), modified and matured in the Golgi, and secreted and assembled into the ECM (5Vertel B.M. Velasco A. LaFrance S. Walters L. Kaczman-Daniel K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Luo W. Kuwada T.S. Chandrasekaran L. Zheng J. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A malfunction in this process because of internal or external problems may harm the chondrocyte and/or result in the production of a defective ECM that causes skeletal abnormalities (8Vertel B.M. Walters L.M. Grier B. Maine N. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 939-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, pseudoachondroplasia (PASCH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias resulting from mutations in the gene coding for cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP), a glycoprotein found in the ECM (9Briggs M.D. Hoffman S.M. King L.M. Olsen A.S. Mohrenweiser H. Leroy J.G. Mortier G.R. Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Gaines E.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 10Hecht J.T. Nelson L.D.

PSACH and MED patients are characterized by short stature, joint pain, and early onset of osteoarthritis (11Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C.

At the ultrastructural level there are enlarged ER vesicles containing accumulated COMP along with type IX collagen and aggrecan (12Delot E. Brodie S.G. King L.M. Wilcox W.R. Cohn D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26692-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Vranka J. Mokashi A. Keene D.R. Tufa S. Corson G. Sussman M. Horton W.A. Maddox K. Sakai L. Bachinger H.P. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another example is Nanomelia, a lethal autosomal recessive defect in chickens resulting from production of defective aggrecan which accumulates in the ER and disrupts normal chondrocyte metabolism (6Luo W. Kuwada T.S. Chandrasekaran L. Zheng J. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16447-16450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Vertel B.M. Walters L.M. Grier B. Maine N. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 939-948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies highlight the importance of the ER-Golgi system for the normal function of chondrocytes. In eukaryotic cells, the ER is a major storage organelle for calcium and site of synthesis and folding of secretory proteins, cell membrane proteins, and lysosomal proteins, prior to their transport to the Golgi for further modification (14Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Under physiological and pathological conditions, such as nutrient deprivation and oxidative stress, the function of the ER is impaired resulting in “ER stress” (15Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). During ER stress, cells may undergo metabolic arrest and activate specific pathways to survive (16Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). If the functions of the ER are severely impaired, apoptosis may occur to eliminate the cells from the organism (16Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 17Breckenridge D.G. Germain M. Mathai J.P. Nguyen M. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). ER stress likely plays an important role in cartilage biology. Chondrocytes experience a variety of stresses such as osmotic stress (18Erickson G.R. Northrup D.L. Guilak F. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2003; 11: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), oxidative stress (19Loeser Jr., R.F. Sci. Aging Knowledge. Environ. 2004; 29: e31Google Scholar), and mechanical stress (20Lee R.B. Wilkins R.J. Razaq S. Urban J.P. Biorheology. 2002; 39: 133-143PubMed Google Scholar), which may act on matrix synthesis (21Pelletier J.P. Jovanovic D.V. Lascau-Coman V. Fernandes J.C. Manning P.T. Connor J.R. Currie M.G. Martel-Pelletier J. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 22Smith R.L. Carter D.R. Schurman D.J. Smith R.L. Clin. Orthop. 2004; 427: 89-95PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the avascular condition of cartilage renders the chondrocytes sensitive to potential depletion of nutrients, such as glucose and oxygen. Despite its obvious importance, little is known about the ER stress response in chondrocytes or the effects of ER stress on chondrocyte proliferation and matrix gene expression. A recent report suggests that multiple outcomes may exist following induction of ER stress in chondrocytes (23Oliver B.L. Cronin C.G. Zhang-Benoit Y. Goldring M.B. Tanzer M.L. J. Cell Physiol. 2004; 204: 45-50Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, this study used a single immortalized chondrocyte cell line and did not report a clear consensus regarding the potential of different agents to induce ER stress in this cell model. Additional studies are needed to fully understand the action of various inducers of ER stress on chondrocytes and the consequences of ER stress. Here we show that a variety of agents, including glucose deprivation, induce ER stress markers in primary and immortalized chondrocytes. Further, we demonstrate that ER stress inhibits chondrocyte growth, causes down-regulation of cartilage matrix expression at both the protein and mRNA level, and ultimately induces chondrocyte apoptosis. Cell Culture and Treatments—Immortalized rat chondrocytes (IRC) were maintained in culture as previously described (24Horton Jr., W.E. Cleveland J. Rapp U. Nemuth G. Bolander M. Doege K. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These cells have a well characterized phenotype that is similar to articular chondrocytes (24Horton Jr., W.E. Cleveland J. Rapp U. Nemuth G. Bolander M. Doege K. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed with cells seeded in monolayer culture at a density of 0.6 × 106 cells/well of 6-well plates. Articular chondrocytes were isolated from femoral heads of 6-day old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles Rivers). Articular cartilage was aseptically dissected and minced and digested with gentle stirring for 2 h at 37 °C in HBSS containing 0.4% (w/v) collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ). Cells were then washed and seeded in T-75 culture flasks. Experiments were performed with second passage cultures at a density of 0.6 × 106 cells/well of 6-well plates. The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) +10% fetal bovine serum, with or without glucose. The following treatments were used where indicated: 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (TN, Sigma), 0.5 μm thapsigargin (TG, Sigma), 3 μg/ml retinoic acid (Sigma), 10 ng/ml TNF-α (Genzyme, Ann Arbor, MI), 1 ng/ml IL-1β (Genzyme), 100 μm sodium nitroprusside (SNP, Sigma), 10 nm STP (stauroporine, Sigma), and 50 μm zVAD-fmk (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). Cell Proliferation Assay—A CellTiter96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega) was used to determine the viability of the cells, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, 1 × 104 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates, and at 24, 48, or 72 h, 20 μl of the aqueous solution were added into each well of control and experimental cultures and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cell viability was measured using a colorimetric 96-well plate reader. Western Blot Assay—Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitors as previously described (25Kinkel M.D. Yagi R. McBurney D. Nugent A. Horton Jr., W.E. Anat. Rec. A. Discov. Mol. Cell Evol. Biol. 2004; 279: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After vortexing, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and supernatants were collected. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay reagent kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. 30 μg of total protein was denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in 2% SDS sample buffer with NuPage reducing agent (Invitrogen). Equivalent amounts of cell protein were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride (Pierce), using the Invitrogen X cell electrophoresis and blotting system (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk 0.1% Tween TBS buffer for 2 h, and were then incubated with the primary antibody overnight. Mouse monoclonal anti-GADD153 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:500 dilution; rat monoclonal anti-caspase-12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:1000 dilution; mouse monoclonal anti-p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:500; goat anti-collagen II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:1000 dilution; goat monoclonal anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:1000 dilution; rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) were used at 1:1000 dilution. After four washes with 0.1% Tween TBS buffer, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse, anti-rat, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat secondary antibody at 1:10,000 dilutions. Following four washes with 0.1% Tween TBS buffer, immunoreactivity was visualized using an ECL system (Pierce). Quantitative RT-PCR—RNA isolation and reverse transcription were carried out as previously described (26Kinkel M.D. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was removed by treating with DNase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed at 37 °C for 60 min. Primers for quantitative real-time PCR were designed as previously described (26Kinkel M.D. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and synthesized by Fisher Scientific. The primer sequences are as follows: Collagen IIα1 forward primer 5′-GAGTGGAAGAGCGGAGACTACTG-3′, Collagen IIα1 reverse primer 5′-CTCCATGTTGCAGAAGACTTTCA-3′; Aggrecan forward primer 5′-CTAGCTGCTTAGCAGGGATAACG-3′, Aggrecan reverse primer 5′-TGACCCGCAGAGTCACAAAG-3′; Link protein forward primer 5′-GCTGGA TTGGTGCAATGCT-3′, Link protein reverse primer 5′-AGGGCTCACGTGGTTTGG-3′; PCNA forward primer 5′-CCAGGGCTCC ATCCTGAA-3′, PCNA reverse primer 5′-CCCAGCAGGCCTCATTGAT-3′; 18S forward primer 5′-AGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA-3′, 18S reverse primer 5′-GATCCGAGGGCCTC ACTAAAC-3′. 18S primers were used at 50 nm, other primers were used at 100 nm, and 18S was used as the normalizer. All primers were verified to have a similar efficiency of amplification according to the manufacturer. The quantitative PCR was performed as previously described (26Kinkel M.D. Horton Jr., W.E. J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reactions were carried out using SYBR Green PCR core reagents (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocol. The ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) was used to run the PCR and collect fluorescence data. Results were analyzed using Sequence Detector v1.7 software (Applied Biosystems), and relative expression levels were calculated using the mathematical formulas recommended by Applied Biosystems (Applied Biosystems User Bulletin 2Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). According to accepted standards, relative differences of 2-fold or greater are considered significant (Applied Biosystems). Alcian Blue Staining—The Alcian Blue staining was performed as previously described (27Horton Jr., W.E. Balakir R. Precht P. Liang C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24804-24808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was removed, the cell layer was rinsed with PBS, and the cultures were fixed in 10% formalin for 15 min, and then stained overnight at 4 °C with Alcian Blue 8-GX (Sigma, 1.0% in 3% acetic acid, pH 1.0). After two rinses with 3% acetic acid and two rinses with PBS, the stained proteoglycan was then extracted overnight with 8 m guanidine HCl supplemented with 0.68 g of sodium acetate/100 ml, and the absorbance was determined at 600 nm. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—IRC cells cultured in 12-well plates in standard conditions as described above were transfected with Col2α1-luciferase construct (generous gift from Dr. V.

Transfected cells were cultured in complete medium for 24 h, then treated with glucose withdrawal, 1 μg/ml tunicamycin, and 0.5 μm thapsigargin for 24 h, and collected for analysis. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were detected with Promega Reporter assay system. Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. of three experiments carried out in duplicate. DNA Ladder—Apoptosis was demonstrated by DNA fragmentation. Adherent cells were collected with a scraper and pooled with the floating cells. Cytosolic DNA was prepared and analyzed on a 1.8% agarose gel by electrophoresis as previously (28Wildey G.M. Patil S. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18069-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Chondrocytes were cultured in 4-well chamber slides at 0.2 × 106 cells/well, and annexin V-PI staining was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit, CalbioChem). For detection of collagen II, IRC chondrocytes grown on chamber slides were washed with PBS and fixed with 5% formalin for 20 min followed by with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. The fixed and permeabilized cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with an anti-collagen II antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature. Collagen type II blocking peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as negative control after incubated with anti-collagen type II antibody for 2 h at room temperature at 10:1 dilution. The stained cells were examined under a confocal laser microscope (Olympus, Fluoview FV300). Nitric Oxide Assay—Analysis of nitric oxide (NO) levels was performed as previously described (29Horton Jr., W.E. Udo I. Precht P. Balakir R. Hasty K. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 100 μl of medium was removed from control and experimental cultures, followed by mixing with 50 μl of Griess Reagent A and 50 μl of Griess Reagent B (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI). The NO level was detected by using a colorimetric 96-well plate reader at 546 nm. The OD of the samples was compared with a standard curve generated by diluting a 20 nm stock of NaNO2 in Ham's F-12 medium. Statistical Analysis—Where necessary, one-way analysis of variance was performed, with p < 0.01 indicating a significant change. Induction of ER Stress in Chondrocytes—The initial hypothesis under study was that disruption of ER function in chondrocytes by multiple signals would result in a typical ER stress response. This hypothesis was tested using the well-known ER stress marker, growth arrest, and DNA-damage inducible protein 153 (GADD153) (30Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). IRC cells maintained in medium containing glucose did not express GADD153 for up to 48 h in culture (Fig. 1A). However, glucose deprivation resulted in a strong induction of GADD153 at 24 h, which remained elevated at 48 h (Fig. 1A). We extended this study to test other potential ER stress-inducing agents. Tunicamycin is a pharmacological inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation that causes defects in glycoprotein trafficking between the ER and Golgi, producing ER stress and inducing apoptosis in some cell types (31Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin is a selective inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) of the ER, which potentially induces ER stress by disturbing ER calcium (32Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar). Both tunicamycin and thapsigargin resulted in induction of GADD153 in chondrocytes to a greater extent than that with glucose withdrawal at 72 h (Fig. 1B). Select immortalized chondrocyte lines may be good models for studying ER stress; however, it is critical to first establish that an identical response can be observed in primary chondrocytes. Primary rat chondrocytes were subjected to the same treatments and an identical pattern of induction of GADD153 was observed as compared with the IRC chondrocytes (Fig. 1C). Caspase-12 is a murine caspase, which is specifically activated in the cells subjected to ER stress (16Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In order to confirm the induction of ER stress in chondrocytes, we examined caspase-12 expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, glucose deprivation up-regulated both procaspase-12 and activated caspase-12 in chondrocytes. Compared with 24 h, there was more procaspase-12 cleaved into activated caspase-12 at 48 h. In addition to glucose withdrawal, TN and TG also up-regulated both pro- and active caspase-12 in chondrocytes (Fig. 2B). Cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β have a wide range of effects on chondrocytes including suppression of cartilage matrix synthesis and stimulation of matrix metalloproteinase expression, perhaps through the production of nitric oxide (21Pelletier J.P. Jovanovic D.V. Lascau-Coman V. Fernandes J.C. Manning P.T. Connor J.R. Currie M.G. Martel-Pelletier J. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this context, we compared the ability of nitric oxide to induce ER stress, as measured by GADD153, to agents that directly perturb ER function. Treatment of chondrocytes with TNF-α, IL-1β, or SNP stimulated nitric oxide production 10-30-fold over control cells, whereas there was no induction of NO in cells treated with the three ER stress inducers (data not shown). No induction of GADD153 was observed with TNF-α or SNP, and only a minimal response was observed with IL-1β (Fig. 3). ER Stress Results in Decreased Matrix Expression in Chondrocytes—The ER is a principle site of protein synthesis and folding, as well as a site of biosynthesis for cartilage matrix by chondrocytes. Therefore we postulated that ER stress might be accompanied by effects on extracellular matrix synthesis. IRC cells were exposed to glucose withdrawal, TN and TG as described previously. At 24, 48, and 72 h, the cell monolayer was stained with Alcian Blue, and the cell-associated proteoglycan was extracted and quantified. Under control conditions, there was a progressive increase in cell-associated proteoglycan (Fig. 4A). In contrast, there was no accumulation of proteoglycan under ER stress-inducing conditions (Fig. 4A). Along with the decreased matrix accumulation, the chondrocytes exposed to ER stress-inducing conditions also showed morphological changes and accumulated less pericellular matrix than control cells (Fig. 4, B-E). Identical results were obtained with primary rat chondrocytes (data not shown). The results using Alcian Blue staining could be due, in part, to a reduction in total cell number. Therefore, we carried out studies to look at matrix gene and protein expression normalized to individual chondrocytes. First, total RNA from IRC chondrocytes and primary rat chondrocytes was isolated, and used to carry out quantitative real-time PCR with primers for collagen II, link protein and aggrecan. By 48 h we began to see decreased matrix gene expression (Fig. 5A), and by 72 h the mRNA coding for all three proteins was greatly decreased (Fig. 5B). At both time points, the expression of collagen II mRNA was preferentially inhibited compared with aggrecan and link protein mRNA. Most significantly, the primary rat chondrocytes showed a similar response with regard to down-regulation of matrix gene expression including the preferential effect on collagen II (Fig. 5C). The expression level of 18 S mRNA showed no significant change with the different treatments at either time point (Fig. 5D).Fig. 5ER stress results in down-regulation of cartilage matrix gene expression in both IRC and primary rat chondrocytes. A and B, IRC chondrocytes were cultured under control conditions or exposed to the ER stress-inducing treatments of glucose withdrawal (-Glu) or TN or TG for 48 h (A) or 72 h (B). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on reverse-transcribed RNA isolated from each condition (see text for details). The results are presented as relative expression of mRNA coding for type II collagen, aggrecan, or link protein (LP) in treated versus control chondrocytes. At 48 h there is a >90% decrease in mRNA coding for collagen II with all three treatments compared with control cells. The level of mRNA coding for aggrecan and LP is also suppressed at this time point, but to a lesser degree than collagen II. By 72 h, the steady state level of mRNA coding for all three matrix proteins is down-regulated by 85% or greater compared with control chondrocytes. Data shown are relative expression levels of mRNA calculated relative to the expression level in control cells for each mRNA transcript (see text for details and controls). C, inhibition of steady state mRNAs coding for collagen II, aggrecan, and LP was also observed with all three ER stress-inducing agents in primary rat chondrocytes. D, there was no significant change in the expression level of the gene coding for 18 S ribosomal subunit with any treatment compared with control cells. Data shown are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. E, ER stress results in decreased Sox9-dependent collagen type II promoter activity. IRC chondrocyte were grown in 12-well plates in normal medium for 24 h, then transfected with 1.5 μg/well Col2α1-luciferase construct and 0.5 μg/well pSV-β-galactosidase control vectors. After 24 h, the transfected cells were treated with glucose withdrawal (-Glu), TN or TG for 24 h. Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. The data are shown as the relative luciferase activity of treated cells compared with control which is set at 1.0. All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. of three experiments carried out in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because all the three treatments exerted a greater effect on collagen type II mRNA expression compared with aggrecan and link protein, we further examined the transcriptional activity of collagen type II under ER stress condition.

CMT4B is caused by recessively inherited mutations in either myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2) or MTMR13 (also called SET-binding factor 2). MTMR2 encodes a member of the myotubularin family of phosphoinositide-3-phosphatases, which dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and bisphosphate PI(3,5)P2. MTMR13 encodes a large, uncharacterized member of the myotubularin family. The MTMR13 phosphatase domain is catalytically inactive because the essential Cys and Arg residues are absent. Given the genetic association of both MTMR2 and MTMR13 with CMT4B, we investigated the biochemical relationship between these two proteins. We found that the endogenous MTMR2 and MTMR13 proteins are associated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. MTMR2-MTMR13 association is mediated by coiled-coil sequences present in each protein. We also examined the cellular localization of MTMR2 and MTMR13 using fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. We found that (i) MTMR13 is a predominantly membrane-associated protein; (ii) MTMR2 and MTMR13 cofractionate in both a light membrane fraction and a cytosolic fraction; and (iii) MTMR13 membrane association is mediated by the segment of the protein which contains the pseudophosphatase domain. This work, which describes the first cellular or biochemical investigation of the MTMR13 pseudophosphatase protein, suggests that MTMR13 functions in association with MTMR2. Loss of MTMR13 function in CMT4B2 patients may lead to alterations in MTMR2 function and subsequent alterations in 3-phosphoinositide signaling. Such a mechanism would explain the strikingly similar phenotypes of patients with recessive mutations in either MTMR2 or MTMR13.

The disease is a heterogeneous group of peripheral neuropathies that lead to progressive degeneration of the muscles of the extremities and loss of sensory function (1Benstead T.J. Grant I.A. Can. J.

Nerve conduction velocity tests are used to differentiate between the demyelinating forms of CMT (types 1, 3, and 4) and the axonal form (type 2). CMT-causing mutations have been identified in 20 distinct human genes, and the cellular mechanisms by which these mutations lead to disease are under active investigation (2Suter U. Scherer S.S. Nat.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which mutations in MTMR2 or MTMR13 lead to CMT4B remain unclear.The myotubularin proteins comprise a large family of protein-tyrosine or dual specificity phosphatase-like phosphatases; 14 members have been identified in the human genome (12Wishart M.J.

In addition to MTMR2 and MTMR13, other myotubularin family members have been shown to play essential roles in mammalian physiology. Mutations in myotubularin (MTM1) cause X-linked myotubular myopathy, a severe disorder in which skeletal muscle cells fail to maintain a properly differentiated state (15Laporte J. Hu L.J. Kretz C.

Specific subclasses of MTMR proteins contain additional protein domains, such as the DENN and PH domains found in MTMR13 and MTMR5 (Fig. 1A). Intriguingly, 6 of the 14 human MTMR phosphatases appear to be catalytically inactive. MTMR5 and MTMRs 9-13 all lack the catalytically essential cysteine and arginine residues found in the CX5R motif, which is the hallmark of the protein-tyrosine or dual specificity phosphatase-like phosphatase superfamily (Fig. 1B).

The specificity of MTMRs for PI(3)P and/or PI(3,5)P2 suggests that these enzymes may regulate endosomal trafficking, and several recent studies have described vesicular trafficking defects resulting from altered MTMR function (30Parrish W.R.

PI(3)P is generated primarily by class III PI 3-kinase (PI3K-III) or its yeast homolog Vps34p (35Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C.

In mammalian cells, PI(3)P is found on early endosomes and on the internal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes, and an analogous distribution of PI(3)P is observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (37Gillooly D.J.

PI(3)P plays an essential role in the endosomal trafficking of both biosynthetic and endocytosed cargos and is thought to function primarily by recruiting membrane proteins that contain PI(3)P-binding FYVE or phagocyte NADPH oxidase domains (39Roth M.G.

In yeast, loss of PI(3,5)P2 results in a defect in vacuolar membrane homeostasis and impairs the trafficking of some biosynthetic cargo to the vacuole (44Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J.

Consistent with studies of Fab1p, the expression of an inactive form of PIKfyve disrupts late endosome homeostasis in mammalian cells (49Ikonomov O.C. Sbrissa D. Shisheva A. J. Biol.

For example, the cellular locations at which MTMRs regulate PI(3)P and/or PI(3,5)P2 are unknown. In addition, the functions of the inactive, but highly conserved, MTMR pseudophosphatases are unknown. The multidomain, noncatalytic nature of large proteins such as MTMR13 and MTMR5 suggests that these molecules might function as molecular scaffolds (Fig. 1). Consistent with this hypothesis, hetero-oligomerization of active and inactive MTMR proteins is emerging as a mechanism by which the active MTMR enzymes may be regulated. MTM1 has been shown to associate with the inactive MTMR12 (also called 3-phosphatase adapter protein) (52Nandurkar H.H. Layton M. Laporte J. Selan C. Corcoran L. Caldwell K.K. Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. Mitchell C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8660-8665Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, MTMR7 (active) has been shown to interact with MTMR9 (inactive) (26Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9768-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Dang H. Li Z. Skolnik E.Y. Fares H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Finally, MTMR2 has been shown to associate with MTMR5 (53Kim S.A. Vacratsis P.O. Firestein R. Cleary M.L. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4492-4497Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Inactive MTMR proteins have thus been proposed to regulate the localization or enzymatic activity of active MTMR PI 3-phosphatases (26Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9768-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 52Nandurkar H.H. Layton M. Laporte J. Selan C. Corcoran L. Caldwell K.K. Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. Mitchell C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Our results indicate that MTMR2 and MTMR13 form a stable complex in cultured mammalian cells. Subcellular fractionation experiments indicate that MTMR13 and MTMR2 are associated both in a particulate light membrane fraction and as a soluble complex. Thus, MTMR2 and MTMR13 may function together as a membrane-associated complex to regulate PI(3)P and/or PI(3,5)P2 levels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPhylogenetic Analysis of Myotubularins—GenBank accession numbers for sequences used for alignments were as follows: human MTM1 (Q13496), MTMR1 (NP_003819), MTMR2 (Q13614), MTMR3 (NP_066576), MTMR4 (NP_004678), MTMR6 (NP_004676), MTMR7 (XP_044727), MTMR8 (NP_060147), MTMR5 (NP_002963), MTMR13 (NP_112224), MTMR9 (NP_056273), MTMR10 (NP_060232), MTMR11 (13Laporte J.

To generate this construct, the KIAA-1766 cDNA clone was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). A PCR product corresponding to bases 1-630 of the MTMR13 ORF was amplified from a human brain cDNA library using oligonucleotides FRO-243b (GCTCGGGTACCACCATGGCCCGGCTGGCTGACTACTTCATCG) and FRO-208 (GCTGGAACAGGAGAGCCACACTAGTGCCCG). This DNA fragment was digested with KpnI and SpeI and ligated to KIAA1766 plasmid that had been digested with KpnI and SpeI, yielding a construct named MTMR13-1-1150. A PCR product corresponding to bases 3275-5550 of the MTMR13 ORF was amplified from a human brain cDNA library using oligonucleotides FRO-209 (GATGAGAGTGAGCTCCCCACAAGTACC) and FRO-280 (GTCAGTCGGAGCTCCGTCTAGACTCAGGCATCAGAGATACAACTCTGGATCTTGTCC). This DNA fragment was digested with SacI and ligated to MTMR13-1-1150, which was digested with SacI. The resulting construct, MTMR13-5KpnI-3XbaI, contained the full-length MTMR13 ORF, flanked by 5′-KpnI and 3′-XbaI sites, between the KpnI and SacI sites of the pBluescript II SK(+) vector (Stratagene). To generate Myc-MTMR13 (N-terminal tag), MTMR13-5KpnI-3XbaI was digested with KpnI and XbaI, and the MTMR13 ORF was ligated to KpnI-XbaI-digested N-Myc-CMV5-1. EGFP-MTMR13 was made by digesting MTMR13-5KpnI-3XbaI with KpnI and XbaI and ligating the MTMR13 ORF to KpnI-XbaI-digested pEGFP-C1 (Clontech).

To make GST-CCMTMR13, MTMR13 bases 4840-5040 were PCR amplified using oligonucleotides FRO-297 (CGTGCGAATTCGAAGCTGGGCCACGGAGCCAGAGG) and FRO-298 (CGTGCCTCGAGTCAGGAGCGATCTGTTCTTGGTTCTTCTTTAAGGTCCACG), and the resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated to EcoRI-SalI-digested pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting bacterial expression plasmid encodes MTMR13 residues 1614-1680 fused to the C terminus of GST.Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—HEK293 and HEK293A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin and were ∼80% confluent at the time of transfection. A 150-mm dish of cells was transfected with 30 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were vortexed and cleared by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Roche Applied Science) and protein A-agarose (Invitrogen). FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel (Sigma). MTMR2 was immunoprecipitated using immune or preimmune serum from rabbit 119 and protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitations were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and subsequently washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer, three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and once more with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were suspended in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). All immunoprecipitates and lysates were resolved in 4-12% or 10% NuPAGE BisTris gels in MOPS buffer (Invitrogen), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting.Subcellular Fractionation—HEK293 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer.

The resulting postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to yield a heavy membrane pellet (P14) and a supernatant (S14). The S14 fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °Ctoa yield light membrane/vesicular pellet (P100) and a soluble fraction (S100).

Although the RUNX2 transcription factor directly regulates many osteoblast-related genes, its function in Bsp expression remains uncertain. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in MC3T3-E1 (clone MC-4) preosteoblast cells, RUNX2 was shown to bind a chromatin fragment containing the proximal Bsp promoter. Two putative RUNX2-binding sites (R1 and R2) were identified within this region of the mouse, rat, and human genes and were shown to bind RUNX2 in vitro and in vivo (by ChIP assay). Site-specific mutagenesis established that both sites act as osteoblast-specific transcriptional enhancers and together account for nearly two-thirds of the total promoter activity. In addition, functional cooperativity was observed between the R2 site and an adjacent homeodomain protein-binding site previously characterized by this laboratory (the C site). All three sites (R1, R2, and C) are necessary for maximal promoter activity in osteoblasts. DLX5 in MC-4 cell nuclear extracts binds to the C site in vitro. Furthermore, ChIP assays revealed that DLX5 is selectively associated with chromatin in the vicinity of the C site only when Bsp is transcriptionally active. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation assays detected a physical complex containing DLX5 and RUNX2. Taken together, our data show that RUNX2 is a direct regulator of Bsp in osteoblasts and that it functions in cooperation with DLX5 or a related factor to activate osteoblast-specific gene expression.

Osteoblast differentiation is a crucial event for skeletal tissue formation, repair, and maintenance. Osteoblasts secrete a complex extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSP, bone sialoprotein; AA, ascorbic acid; EMSA; electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s); IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. containing collagenous and noncollagenous proteins. This ECM interacts with cells by binding to β1 subunit-containing integrins that signal to the cell nucleus to regulate gene expression (1Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J.

Biol. 2000; 220: 2-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is one of the major noncollagenous components of the bone ECM, and its expression is primarily restricted to hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts (4Cowles E.A. DeRome M.E. Pastizzo G. Brailey L.L. Gronowicz G.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1998; 62: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). During osteoblast differentiation, BSP is up-regulated as the ECM mineralizes (5Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Thus, BSP is one of the primary markers of the differentiated osteoblast, and knowledge concerning the mechanisms controlling its expression will be of critical importance to understand the regulation of bone formation and osteoblast differentiation. Regulatory regions of all eukaryotic genes contain general and tissue-specific enhancer sequences that, on interaction with the appropriate nuclear proteins, specify the overall pattern of gene expression. Viewing transcription factors as functioning in complexes and interacting with each other provides a model that can explain how a cell lineage is defined during differentiation (6Franceschi R.T. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 72: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the case of osteoblast differentiation, gene deletion studies have so far definitively identified three transcription factors as being required for development of this cell type. The first factor, RUNX2, the bone-related product of the Cbfa1 gene, is first expressed at embryonic day 12.5 in mice and is required for early commitment of mesenchymal cells to chondro/osteoblastic lineages (7Ducy P.

Cbfa1–/– mice fail to form hypertrophic chondrocytes or osteoblasts and produce a cartilaginous skeleton that is completely devoid of mineralized matrix. The other two factors, OSX and ATF4, function downstream to further restrict chondro/osteogenic precursors to the osteoblast phenotype. Osx–/– mice are able to form hypertrophic chondrocytes but fail to form osteoblasts (10Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B.

Paleari L. Zerega B. Postiglione M.P. Mantero S. Bober E. Barbieri O. Simeone A. Levi G. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3795-3809PubMed Google Scholar), whereas combined deletion of Dlx5 and Dlx6 leads to defects in the transition from prehypertrophic to hypertrophic chondrocytes, severe disruptions in osteoblast gene expression, and delayed mineralization (17Acampora D. Merlo G.R. Paleari L. Zerega B. Postiglione M.P. Mantero S. Bober E. Barbieri O. Simeone A. Levi G. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3795-3809PubMed Google Scholar). Our group has been interested in defining mechanisms controlling bone-specific gene expression by using Bsp as a model. Previous studies identified a 2.5-kb promoter region of the murine gene that exhibits osteoblast-selective activity in vitro and in vivo (18Benson M.D. Aubin J.E. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Gopalakrishnan R. Thomas P.E. Benson M.D. Wang D. Franceschi R.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This promoter contains two putative RUNX2-binding sites having the consensus sequence, RCCRC(A/T), that is known to bind members of the Runt family of transcription factors (20Kamachi Y. Ogawa E. Asano M. Ishida S. Murakami Y. Satake M. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4808-4819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sites are located –61 and –1335 bp from the transcription start site. Most surprisingly, neither site was found to contribute to the osteoblast-specific activity of this promoter (18Benson M.D. Aubin J.E. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, a homeodomain factor-binding site designated site C or osteoblast-specific homeodomain element 1 (OSHE1) was identified in the proximal Bsp promoter and shown to partially explain the tissue-specific activity of this gene in vitro and in transgenic mice (19Gopalakrishnan R. Thomas P.E. Benson M.D. Wang D. Franceschi R.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 21Benson M.D. Bargeon J.L. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Kim A. Cui Y. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13907-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We also discovered that DLX5 could bind to the C site in vitro and regulate its enhancer activity (21Benson M.D. Bargeon J.L. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Kim A. Cui Y. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13907-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast to our early negative results regarding the involvement of RUNX2 in Bsp expression, considerable evidence exists suggesting direct or indirect involvement of this transcription factor in the bone-specific expression of Bsp. Thus, BSP is greatly reduced in the bones of Cbfa1–/– animals (22Hoshi K. Komori T. Ozawa H. Bone (San Diego). 1999; 25: 639-651Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative RUNX2 can block Bsp transcription in vivo (23Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). More recent studies with breast cancer cells also showed that RUNX2, normally expressed only in bone-derived cells, is ectopically overexpressed in these cells and can act as a positive regulator of Bsp promoter activity (24Barnes G.L. Javed A. Waller S.M. Kamal M.H. Hebert K.E. Hassan M.Q. Bellahcene A. Van Wijnen A.J. Young M.F. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2631-2637PubMed Google Scholar). In view of these findings, we considered it important to examine further the possible involvement of RUNX2 in Bsp expression by conducting a detailed analysis of the promoter structure for cryptic RUNX2-responsive regions. As will be shown, the proximal Bsp promoter contains two such sites (R1 and R2) having a sequence that slightly diverges from the consensus runt domain protein-binding site. These elements together with the C site account for most of the osteoblast-specific activity of the proximal Bsp promoter. We will also show that one of these sites (R2) functionally interacts with the C site and, furthermore, that part of this functionality can be explained by physical interactions between DLX5 bound to the C site and RUNX2 bound to R2. Cell Culture—The isolation of preosteoblastic clone 4 cells (MC-4) from the parent MC3T3-E1 line was described previously (5Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 25Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in ascorbic acid-free α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. MC-4 differentiation was induced by the addition of 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (AA) to the medium for 5–6 days (26Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The murine pluripotent mesenchymal cell line, C3H10T1/2, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). C3H10T1/2 cells were grown under the same conditions as MC-4 cells. C2C12 mouse myoblasts (27Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. Daniel Goldman (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor), and COS7 monkey kidney cells (from American Type Culture Collection) (28Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. C2C12 cells were induced to differentiate into myotubes by switching to 2% horse serum for 6 days. DNA Constructs—Construction of recombinant adenovirus expressing RUNX2 (AdCMV-Runx2) was described previously (29Yang S. Wei D. Wang D. Phimphilai M. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Control adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (AdCMV-LacZ) was purchased from the University of Michigan Vector Core Laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI). Construction of plasmid p2472 containing the region of the murine Bsp gene from –2472 to +41 and 5′ deletion constructs p705, p338, p178, and p49 were described previously (18Benson M.D. Aubin J.E.

Mutations in the Bsp promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were generated from the plasmid p2472 by PCR using the QuickChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the mutant constructs were verified by sequencing (University of Michigan Sequencing Core, Ann Arbor). The following plasmid constructs were generated from p2472. 1) pMR1– contains a 2-bp mutation in the R1 site of the Bsp promoter at positions –86 and –87 (AACGAACA). 2) pMR2– contains a 2-bp mutation in the R2 site of the Bsp promoter at positions –187 and –188 (ATCGAACA). 3) pMR12– contains the mutations in both the R1 and R2 sites described for the pMR1 and pMR2 constructs. pMC– was described previously as p2472mut3 (21Benson M.D. Bargeon J.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13907-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and contains a 2-bp mutation in the core sequence of the homeodomain-binding site (C site) of the Bsp promoter at positions –196 and –197 (CCCTTAAA). 4) pMR1C– contains the mutations in both the R1 and C sites described for pMR1 and pMC. 5) pMR2C– contains the mutations in both the R2 and C sites described for pMR2 and pMC. 6) pMR12C– contains the mutations in the R1, R2, and C sites described for pMR1, pMR2, and pMC. The underlined boldface letters indicate the mutated nucleotides that differ from the wild type Bsp promoter sequence. The RUNX2 expression plasmid pCMV5-Runx2 (pCMV5-Cbfa1) and control plasmid pCMV5-LacZ (pCMV5-β-gal) were described previously (21Benson M.D. Bargeon J.L. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Kim A. Cui Y.

The DLX5 expression plasmid pcDNA3-Dlx5 (named pDlx5), which encodes DLX5 with an N-terminal FLAG tag, was the generous gift of Dr. Dwight Towler (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) (12Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transfections—All adherent cell lines were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes at a density of 2.5 × 105 cell/cm2, grown for 12 h, and transfected with 600 ng of Bsp-luciferase reporter construct plus 60 ng of pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase vector (Promega) for normalization. After transfection, cells were switched to the appropriate differentiation media and grown for 6 days. In the case of C3H10T1/2 or COS7 cells, they were also transfected using 400 ng of Bsp-luciferase reporter construct and 400 ng of RUNX2 expression (pCMV5-Runx2) or control (pCMV5-LacZ) vector plus 40 ng of Renilla luciferase vector. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Luciferase expression in cell lysates was assayed using the dual luciferase reporter kit (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Pharmingen). All transfection experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. When the transfections were performed in MC-4 cells for ChIP analysis, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at the same density described above and transfected with 4 μg of each reporter vector following AA treatment for 6 days. For the co-immunoprecipitation studies, COS7 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 2.5 μg of DLX5 (pDlx5) and RUNX2 (pCMV5-Runx2) expression plasmids and were harvested after 48 h for the preparation of nuclear extracts. Transductions and Real-time PCR—C3H10T1/2 cells were infected with an adenovirus containing Runx2 cDNA (AdCMV-Runx2) or lacZ (AdCMV-LacZ) at 100 plaque-forming units/cell. The infected cells were treated with ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) every other day and harvested in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) on day 6. Total RNA was prepared as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) and then cleaned with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, catalog number 74104). RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using Taqman reverse transcription reagents for first-strand cDNA synthesis (Applied Biosystem, catalog number N808-0234). Real-time PCRs were performed with the first-strand cDNA corresponding to 20 ng of total RNA and the Taqman universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as well as one of the following Taqman predeveloped assay reagents for mouse: 1) Bsp (FAM/MGB probe; Applied Biosystems, catalog number Mm00492555_m1); 2) Runx2 (FAM/MGB probe; Applied Biosystems, catalog number Mm00501578_m1); 3) Dlx5 (FAM/MGB probe; Applied Biosystems, catalog number Mm00438430-m1); and 4) Gapdh (Applied Biosystems, catalog number Mm99999915_g1). Universal mouse reference RNA (Stratagene, catalog number 740100-41) was used to generate a relative standard curve. Real-time detection of PCR products was performed on an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) in the School of Dentistry Molecular Biology Core. Levels of mRNA were normalized with Gapdh. All real-time PCR results were calculated from triplicate RNA samples. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclei from 5-day AA-treated MC-4 cells were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (25Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and were used for preparation of nuclear extracts according to the method of Dignam et al. (32Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (see Table I) were end-labeled by filling with Klenow (Invitrogen) in a reaction containing 2 pmol of oligonucleotide, cold G, A, and T nucleotides, and 80 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. The labeled oligonucleotide (probe) was then purified using ProbeQuant™ G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For supershift experiments, 2 μg of nuclear extract were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 200 ng of the indicated antibodies in binding buffer containing 12% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% v/v protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Nuclear extract-antibody complexes were mixed with ∼10 fmol of the labeled probe in a 15-μl reaction, following 10 min of incubation at room temperature. Reactions were then electrophoresed on 5% acrylamide gels in 1× TBE (Invitrogen) for 120 min at 180 V at 4 °C, and gels were dried and autoradiographed. The following antibodies were used: RUNX2 (M 70), DLX5 (Y20), DLX6 (G20), or rabbit IgG purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyOligo nameSequenceP1GCCTCAGTTGAATAAACATGAAAP2TCCTCACCCTTCAATTAAATCCCACAAP3GAACCACAAAAGAGAAGTTGAATAAGCP4AACACTTTGGTTTGGTAGAGAACTGAPBL1TACCAACAGTACCGGAATGCCPBL2ATCCGTGCCACTCACTCGAoR1GGATTCTCTGGTGAGAACCCACAGCCTGTAAGAGACCACTCTTGGGTGTCGGACGGomR1GGATTCTCTGGTGAGAACGAACAGCCTGTAAGAGACCACTCTTGCTTGTCGGACGGoR2GGTAAATCCCACAATGCAAGCCTCTTGGATTTAGGGTGTTACGTTCGGAGAACCGGomR2GGTAAATCGAACAATGCAAGCCTCTTGGATTTAGCTTGTTACGTTCGGAGAACCGGoCR2GGACCCTTCAATTAAATCCCACAATGCATGGGAAGTTAATTTAGGGTGTTACGTGGoCmR2GGACCCTTCAATTAAATCGAACAATGCATGGGAAGTTAATTTAGCTTGTTACGTGG Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitation—Approximately 500 μg of nuclear extract was prepared from MC-4 or COS7 cells transfected with DLX5 and RUNX2 expression plasmids. Extracts were diluted to 800 μl in co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 60 μl of protein A/G-plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies were added to the precleared nuclear extracts following incubation at 4 °C overnight. To precipitate immunocomplexes, 50 μl of protein A/G plus agarose beads were added and further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with co-IP buffer, one time with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), suspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting with RUNX2 (M70) antibody (1:1000 dilution) or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed using a protocol kindly provided by Dr. Dwight Towler (Washington University) (33Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After sonication, the amount of chromatin was quantified using the PicoGreen double-stranded DNA Quantitation Assay (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The equivalent of 10 μg of DNA was used as starting material (input) in each ChIP reaction with 2 μg of the appropriate antibody (RUNX2 (M70), DLX5 (Y20), or control rabbit or goat IgG). Fractions of the purified ChIP DNA (5%) or inputs (0.02–0.05%) were used for PCR analysis. The reaction was performed with AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) for 30 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C. PCR primer pairs were generated to detect DNA segments located near the putative RUNX2-binding site at –1335 (primers P3 and P4) or in the proximal promoter region (primers P1 and P2; see Fig. 2A and Table I). The PCR products were separated on 3% agarose gels and visualized with ultraviolet light. All ChIP assays were repeated at least two times and with duplicate samples for each antibody used in the immunoprecipitation reactions. When the ChIP assay was performed in MC-4 cells transfected with Bsp promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, PCR primers were designed to amplify a 62-bp fragment of the Bsp promoter-luciferase chimeric gene. One primer (PBL1) was selected from the last 19 bp of Bsp promoter fragment (–2472 to +41) cloned in pGL3Basic, and the second primer (PBL2) includes 21 bp of the specific plasmid sequence located just 8 bp before the start of luciferase coding region (see Fig. 5A and Table I). In this case the PCR proceeded for 23 cycles of amplification. Quantitative PCR analysis was also performed before immunoprecipitation to ensure equal transfection efficiencies. Statistical Analysis—Unless stated otherwise, all results are expressed as means ± S.D. of triplicate independent measurements with all experiments being repeated at least three times. Statistical significance was assessed using a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test with an Instat 4.0 software package. RUNX2-responsive Regions in the Bsp Promoter—Gene deletion and dominant-negative approaches clearly demonstrated that RUNX2 is necessary for expression of Bsp in osteoblasts (23Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the effects of this transcription factor are direct (e.g. involve binding of RUNX2 to enhancer sequences in the Bsp promoter) or require induction of secondary factors. To begin exploring the mechanism used by RUNX2 to regulate Bsp, the activity of this gene was examined in the murine C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cell line. We showed previously (29Yang S. Wei D. Wang D. Phimphilai M. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) that these cells undergo osteoblast differentiation and form a bone-like mineralized matrix after transduction with an adenovirus expressing RUNX2 in vitro and in vivo. Fig. 1A shows that RUNX2 overexpression also stimulates Bsp mRNA. For this experiment, cells were transduced with recombinant adenovirus expressing RUNX2 (AdCMV-Runx2) or control adenovirus (AdCMV-LacZ). Fig. 1A, upper panel, shows that C3H10T1/2 cells express minimal RUNX2 protein when transduced with control virus and high levels after AdCMV-Runx2 transduction. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that RUNX2 stimulated Bsp mRNA levels by more than 20-fold (Fig. 1A, lower panel). To examine effects of RUNX2 on Bsp gene transcription, we next examined a series of previously developed 5′ deletions in the 2.5-kb murine Bsp promoter that were fused to a luciferase reporter (Fig. 1B). This promoter region contains sufficient information to direct osteoblast-selective expression of luciferase and lacZ reporter genes in vitro and in vivo (19Gopalakrishnan R. Thomas P.E. Benson M.D. Wang D. Franceschi R.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 21Benson M.D. Bargeon J.L. Xiao G. Thomas P.E. Kim A. Cui Y. Franceschi R.T. J.

The indicated promoter constructs (p2472, p705, p338, p178, and p49) were transfected into C3H10T1/2 cells together with a Renilla luciferase normalization vector and either a control (pCMV-LacZ) or RUNX2 expression plasmid (pCMV-Runx2). As shown in Fig. 1B, RUNX2 induced a 5-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells transfected with full-length promoter (p2472), and this stimulation was retained in all deletion constructs except p49, which contains only a minimal Bsp promoter. Most interestingly, p178 was stimulated to nearly the same degree as the full-length promoter even though this construct lacks a previously characterized homeodomain protein-binding site (C site between –192 and –200 bp from the transcription start site) known to be required for osteoblast-specific activity of this gene (21Benson M.D. Bargeon J.L.

These results suggest that RUNX2-responsive elements are in the proximal promoter region between –49 and –178. Bsp Promoter Occupancy in Vivo; Evidence for Association of RUNX2 with a Promoter Region Near the C Site—We next examined whether RUNX2 is able to interact directly with Bsp."
https://openalex.org/W2026972111,"Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an unusual aspartyl protease that mediates clearance of signal peptides by proteolysis within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Like presenilins, which provide the proteolytically active subunit of the γ-secretase complex, SPP contains a critical GXGD motif in its C-terminal catalytic center. Although SPP is known to be an aspartyl protease of the GXGD type, several presenilin homologues/SPP-like proteins (PSHs/SPPL) of unknown function have been identified by data base searches. We now investigated the subcellular localization and a putative proteolytic activity of PSHs/SPPLs in cultured cells and in an in vivo model. We demonstrate that SPPL2b is targeted through the secretory pathway to endosomes/lysosomes, whereas SPP and SPPL3 are restricted to the ER. As suggested by the differential subcellular localization of SPPL2b compared with SPP and SPPL3, we found distinct phenotypes upon antisense gripNA-mediated knockdown in zebrafish. spp and sppl3 knockdowns in zebrafish result in cell death within the central nervous system, whereas reduction of sppl2b expression causes erythrocyte accumulation in an enlarged caudal vein. Moreover, expression of D/A mutations of the putative C-terminal active sites of spp, sppl2, and sppl3 produced phenocopies of the respective knockdown phenotypes. Thus, our data suggest that all investigated PSHs/SPPLs are members of the novel family of GXGD aspartyl proteases.

Although the site-two protease and rhomboids belong to the class of metallo- and serine proteases, respectively, γ-secretase and SPP are aspartyl proteases (2Weihofen A. Martoglio B.

Intramembrane-cleaving cysteine proteases have so far not been identified. It should, however, be noted that the precise cleavage sites of the site-two protease, rhomboids, and SPPs have not yet been directly determined; thus, it remains possible that cleavage could also occur at or close to the membrane. signal peptide peptidase SPP-like proteins presenilin β-amyloid precursor protein The catalytic core of γ-secretase is provided by either of the two homologous presenilins (PS1 or PS2). Co-factors including anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH-1), presenilin enhancer (PEN)-1, PEN-2, and Nicastrin are absolutely required to generate a functional γ-secretase complex (10Haass C.

Moreover, several distinct species of APH-1 also appear to be functionally redundant at least with respect to γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein fragments (19Shirotani K.

In addition, differential activities of individual complexes within different subcellular compartments can also not be excluded. The C-terminal critical aspartate of PSs is located within a conserved GXGD motif (22Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal aspartate is embedded within a YD sequence segment. The GXGD signature motif is highly conserved in SPP, an unrelated polytopic aspartyl protease (2Weihofen A. Martoglio B.

Moreover, mutagenesis of the corresponding aspartate residue blocks the proteolytic activity of SPP (7Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B.

Taylor R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1502-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the aspartate within the GXGD motif comprises the C-terminal active site of these proteases. Furthermore, SPP can also be targeted with highly specific γ-secretase inhibitors, demonstrating the similarity of the catalytic centers of SPP and γ-secretase (27Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K.

Further similarities are observed between PSs, SPP, and type four prepilin peptidases, which also include a PXL motif within the C-terminal domain. SPP is required for the removal of signal peptides (2Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, SPP is also involved in immune surveillance and processing of the hepatitis C viral core protein (7Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), suggesting a more general role of SPP in the liberation of bioactive peptides (2Weihofen A. Martoglio B.

Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Besides SPP, a family of homologous proteins was identified by data base searches (2Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B.

Biochemistry (Mosc). 2002; 67: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These proteins were named SPPL (SPP-like) 2 (a, b, c) and 3 (in yeast an additional SPPL, SPPL4, exists) (7Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) or PS homologues 1-5 (30Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For clarity, we will use the term SPPL throughout this manuscript. Although SPPLs share some homology with SPPs, it is not known if they exhibit any proteolytic activity (24Wolfe M.S. Kopan R. Science. 2004; 305: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We now investigated the subcellular distribution and catalytic function of SPP and SPPLs in human cells and in zebrafish and suggest that SPPLs are novel members of the family of aspartyl proteases of the GXGD type. Moreover, by demonstrating an endosomal/lysosomal localization of SPPL2b, we provide first evidence that the function of these proteases may not be necessarily restricted to the ER and the removal of signal peptides within the early secretory pathway. Cell Culture, cDNAs, and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). SPP, SPPL2b, and SPPL3 cDNAs were amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA library using the following primers: SPP, 5′-CGCGAATTCGCCACCATGGACTCGGCCCTCAGC-3′ and 5′-CGCCTCGAGTTTCTCTTTCTTCTCCAGCC-3′; SPPL2b, 5′-CGCGAATTCGCCACCATGGCGGCAGCGGTGGCGGCTG-3′ and 5′-CGCCTCGAGCTAGGCCGAGGCGCCAGGCTGG-3′; SPPL3, 5′-CGCGAATTCGCCACCATGGCGGAGCAGACCTACTCGT-3′ and 5′-CGCCTCGAGTACTTCCAGGAATCGGGAGCTG-3′. SPP and SPPL3 were subcloned into the pcDNA4/TO/Myc-His vector and transfected into HEK293 TR cells (Invitrogen). SPPL2b was subcloned into pcDNA4/Myc-His (Invitrogen) and transfected into a HEK293 cell line stably overexpressing APP 695 containing the Swedish mutation (32Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C.

Transfection of cells was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions, and single cell clones were generated by selection in 200 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). To induce expression of SPP and SPPL3, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline added to the cell culture medium for 48 h. Antibodies, Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—The polyclonal anti-SPP antibody 2812 (against amino acids 201-377 of human SPP) and polyclonal anti-SPPL3 antibody 4a (against amino acids 370-384 of human SPPL3) were obtained from Memorec Biotech GmbH (Cologne). The polyclonal anti-SPPL2b antibody N159 was generated by immunization of rabbits with a synthetic peptide representing the amino acids 213-227 of human SPPL2b coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). The monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 and the monoclonal anti-LAMP2 antibody were obtained from the hybridoma bank, the monoclonal anti-BiP antibody was from Stressgen, and the polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody was from Calbiochem. Pulse-chase experiments, cell lysis, and immunodetection were carried out as described before (34Fluhrer R. Capell A. Westmeyer G. Willem M. Hartung B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Walter J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation Experiments—For the deglycosylation experiments cell lysates were denatured with 1% SDS for 10 min at 65 °C, diluted 1:10 in assay buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 12 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet-P40) to a protein concentration of ∼ 1 μg/μl, and treated overnight at 37 °C with 50 milliunits/ml N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) or 0.25 milliunits/μl endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on polylysinecoated coverslips, fixed for 20 min with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 20 min with PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. Antibody incubations were performed for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation with Alexa 488- and Alexa 594-coupled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), and mounted samples were analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent microscope. Fish Maintenance and Breeding—Zebrafish were maintained, mated, and raised as described (35Mullins M.C. Hammerschmidt M. Haffter P. Nusslein-Volhard C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 189-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Embryos were kept at 28 °C and staged as described (36Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8771) Google Scholar). The wild type line AB was used for all experiments. In Situ Hybridization and Acridine Orange Staining—In situ hybridizations were carried out as described elsewhere (37Schulte-Merker S. Ho R.K. Herrmann B.G. Nusslein-Volhard C. Development. 1992; 116: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The single-stranded RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Applied Science). The second antibody was preincubated overnight with zebrafish embryos. All washing steps were carried out at 65 °C. Washes were as follows: 2× 30 min in 50% formamide, 2× SSCT (standard saline critrate + 0.1% Tween); 1× 15 min in 2× SSCT; 2× 30 min in 0.2× SSCT. To reduce endogenous phosphatase activity, 0.25 mg/ml levamisole was added to the staining buffer. Dechorionated embryos were incubated alive in 2 mg/ml acridine orange in E3 medium for 30 min at room temperature. Stained embryos were analyzed after 3 wash steps of 5 min with E3 medium. Antisense gripNAs and Microinjection of Zebrafish Embryos—Antisense gripNAs of 18 nucleotides in length were obtained from Active Motif. For spp and the sppl genes we used a grip designed against the ATG-start codon (ATG-grip) to block translational start (the ATG site is in bold) and an independent gripNA hybridizing to an exon-intron junction, resulting in a nonsense splicing product (GT-grip). As controls, three bases of the ATG-grip were modified (underlined below). In the case of spp the ATG control grip is shifted five nucleotides further upstream in addition to the two modified nucleotides: spp ATG-grip, 5′-CTGCTCCACATCCGCCAT-3′; spp GT-grip, 5′-CGTACCTCATTGTGTGAG-3′; spp ATG-control grip, 5′-CTACATTCGCCATGCTTC-3′; sppl2 ATG-grip, 5′-TGTGATCTCCCCATCCG-3′; sppl2 GT-grip, 5′-CTTACTTTTTCCTGTCCC-3′; sppl2 ATG-control grip, 5′-TATGATCTCGCCATACG-3′; sppl3 ATG-grip, 5′-CTCTGCTCCGCCATGTCA-3′; sppl3 GT-grip, 5′-CGCACCGTCCATGAGCAG-3′; sppl3 ATG-control grip, 5′-CTCGGCTCCGCAATGCCA-3′. Embryos were microinjected with a Femto Jet Microinjector (Eppendorf) at the one-cell stage with gripNA concentrations varying from 0.12 to 1.0 mm depending on the severity of the observed phenotype. The injected volume was 2-4 pl. After injection the embryos were maintained in embryo medium at 28 °C. Zebrafish cDNA Constructs, mRNA Synthesis, and Generation of Mutant mRNA—cDNA clones encoding spp (MPMGp637A0723Q2), sppl2 (MPMGp609O0125Q8), and sppl3 (MPMGp637N1021Q2) were obtained from the German Resource Centre for Genome Research (RZPD) (www.rzpd.de). Sequences were submitted to GenBank™ (accession numbers are AY926458 for spp, AY926457 for sppl2 and AY926459 for sppl3). Full-length spp, sppl2, and sppl3 were subcloned into the pCS2+ (sitemaker.umich.edu/dlturner.vectors) expression vector. mRNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE MACHINE kit (Ambion) and polyadenylated using a polyadenylation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The codon encoding the critical aspartate was mutagenized to an alanine codon after the QuikChange (Stratagene) protocol. Successful mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing. Differential Subcellular Localization of SPPLs—Besides SPP itself, the SPP family comprises four additional members of unknown function in mammals, two of which, SPPL2b and SPPL3, are conserved in all vertebrates ((7Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 30Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); see also Fig. 3). They were, therefore, chosen for a functional analysis in cultured cells and in zebrafish as a model system. As a first step we examined expression and maturation of Myc-tagged human SPPL2b (the only SPPL2 present in the zebrafish genome; see Fig. 3) and SPPL3 in comparison to SPP in HEK293 cells. Clones stably expressing SPP/SPPLs were generated, and expression levels were analyzed (Fig. 1A). As shown previously, two major SPP bands were detected, which may represent monomeric and dimeric variants (28Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15153-15160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Friedmann E. Lemberg M.K. Weihofen A. Dev K.K. Dengler U. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50790-50798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). SPPL2b was expressed as two bands of 90 and 110 kDa (Fig. 1A), molecular masses considerably higher than predicted (64.7 kDa). In addition, a higher molecular mass band was also observed, again suggesting oligomerization to a variable degree (Fig. 1A (38Friedmann E. Lemberg M.K. Weihofen A. Dev K.K. Dengler U. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50790-50798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)). SPPL3 was observed as an ∼40-kDa protein (Fig. 1A). As for SPP and SPPL2b, dimers and higher molecular mass oligomers of SPPL3 were sometimes observed (see also Fig. 1B; lower panel).FIGURE 1Expression and maturation of SPP and SPPLs.A, lysates of HEK293 cells stably transfected with Myc-tagged SPPL2b (lane 1), SPP (lane 2), or SPPL3 (lane 3) were immunoprecipitated with antibodies N159, 2812, or 4a, respectively. Immunoprecipitated SPP or SPPLs were identified with the anti-Myc antibody 9E10. Mature and immature forms of SPPL2b are indicated by arrows. Bands marked with an asterisk (*) represent the putative dimeric forms of the respective protein. Note that tags do not affect expression and membrane orientation of SPP/SPPL (38Friedmann E. Lemberg M.K. Weihofen A. Dev K.K. Dengler U. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50790-50798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). B, HEK293 cells stably expressing SPP and SPPL3 were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min and chased for the time points indicated. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using the 9E10 antibody and detected by autoradiography. Note that neither SPP nor SPPL3 undergoes a molecular weight shift during the chase period. C, HEK293 cells stably expressing SPPL2b were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min and chased for the time points indicated. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using the 9E10 antibody and detected by autoradiography. Note that SPPL2b undergoes a molecular weight shift during the chase period.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether the two immunoreactive bands of SPPL2b result from posttranslational modification, pulse-chase experiments were performed. Whereas SPP and SPPL3 showed no posttranslational maturation (as monitored by the absence of a molecular mass shift during the chase period; Fig. 1B), SPPL2b is expressed at time point 0 min as a single band, which during the chase period is reduced at the expense of a higher molecular mass protein (Fig. 1C). This may suggest that SPPL2b posttranslationally maturates by glycosylation during its targeting through the secretory pathway. Putative glycosylation of SPPL2b was, therefore, further investigated by selective removal of N-linked sugar side chains (Fig. 2A). N-Glycosidase F treatment of cell lysates from SPPL2b-expressing cells resulted in the detection of a single band of ∼70 kDa, which roughly corresponds to the calculated molecular mass of SPPL2b (64.7 kDa). In contrast, endoglycosidase H treatment caused only a minor shift of the upper band to a lower molecular mass (Fig. 2A), whereas the lower molecular weight variant of SPPL2b was fully endoglycosidase H-sensitive (Fig. 2A). This demonstrates that the upper band of SPPL2b becomes partially endoglycosidase H-resistant (as observed for example for nicastrin (39Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 40Herreman A. Van Gassen G. Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Craessaerts K. Mueller U. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J.

This is somewhat surprising since proteins of the SPP family may have been expected to be located within early secretory compartments, namely the ER, where signal peptide cleavage occurs (7Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 42Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Accordingly, SPP even appears to be actively retained within the ER by a KKXX ER retrieval signal (7Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). To further substantiate trafficking of SPPL2b through the secretory pathway, an indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed. As expected (7Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) SPP co-localized with the ER marker BiP (Fig. 2B). In cells overexpressing SPPL3, a similar staining pattern was observed that again overlapped with an ER marker (Fig. 2B), suggesting that SPPL3 also localizes to the ER. In contrast, SPPL2b was found predominantly in vesicular structures, which were positive for LAMP-2 (Fig. 2B), a marker for late endosomes/lysosomes (43Chen J.W. Murphy T.L. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. August J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Co-staining with the ER marker BiP showed little co-localization, demonstrating that SPPL2b does not accumulate within the ER (Fig. 2B). The small amounts of SPPL2b found in the ER may be due to immature SPPL2b transported through the early secretory pathway. Thus, the data from indirect immunofluorescence are consistent with our observation from the pulse-chase and deglycosylation experiments (Figs. 1, B and C and 2A) and demonstrate that SPPL2b, in contrast to SPP and SPPL3, is targeted through the entire secretory pathway to endosomes/lysosomes. These data demonstrate that not all proteins of the SPP family are restricted to the early secretory compartment, indicating functional diversity. Identification and Developmental Expression of Zebrafish SPPLs—To investigate putative individual proteolytic functions of SPPLs in vivo, we turned to zebrafish as a model system. We have used this system previously to study γ-secretase function in vivo and to elucidate the function of the Nicastrin-like protein Nicalin (44Leimer U. Lun K. Romig H. Walter J. Grunberg J.

We show here that catechol estrogens directly inhibit soluble adenylyl cyclases and the abundant trans-membrane adenylyl cyclases. Catechol estrogen inhibition is non-competitive with respect to the substrate ATP, and we solved the crystal structure of a catechol estrogen bound to a soluble adenylyl cyclase from Spirulina platensis in complex with a substrate analog. The catechol estrogen is bound to a newly identified, conserved hydrophobic patch near the active center but distinct from the ATP-binding cleft. Inhibitor binding leads to a chelating interaction between the catechol estrogen hydroxyl groups and the catalytic magnesium ion, distorting the active site and trapping the enzyme substrate complex in a non-productive conformation. This novel inhibition mechanism likely applies to other adenylyl cyclase inhibitors, and the identified ligand-binding site has important implications for the development of specific adenylyl cyclase inhibitors.

Oxidative hydroxylation of the steroid hormone estrogen, which results in the formation of catechol estrogens (CEs 1The abbreviations used are: CE, catechol estrogen; AC, adenylyl cyclase; sAC, soluble AC; tmAC, trans-membrane AC; 2-CE, 2-hydroxyestradiol; 4-CE, 4-hydroxyestradiol; CyaC, cyanobacterial sAC; α,β-Me-ATP, α,β-methylene-adenosine-5′-triphosphate.; Fig. 1), is the first step in estrogen catabolism. CEs, however, are not only catabolites; they are involved in a multitude of physiological processes and may contribute to many human diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular conditions (1Zhu B.T. Conney A.H. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 2Dubey R.K. Tofovic S.P. Jackson E.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 308: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). High concentrations of CEs are found in a number of tissues such as the brain, endocrine glands (3Paul S.M. Axelrod J. Science. 1977; 197: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and mammary tumors (4Liehr J.G. Ricci M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3294-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Although CEs elicit some physiological responses via the classical estrogen receptor, other biological CE effects are not associated with activation of this receptor (5Das S.K. Taylor J.A.

Ganjam V.K. Rottinghaus G.E. Welshons W.V. Lubahn D.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6698-6708Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the latter regard, it has long been known that CEs exert effects in the cAMP signaling system, as shown by their inhibition of cAMP accumulation in the hypothalamus (7Paul S.M. Skolnick P. Nature. 1977; 266: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The conversion of ATP to cAMP in mammals is mediated by members of the class III adenylyl cyclase family (AC; E.C. 4.6.1.1), which in humans comprises nine trans-membrane AC enzymes (tmACs) and one soluble AC (sAC) (8Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). tmACs are regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins in response to the stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors and therefore play a key role in the cellular response to extracellular signals (10Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). sAC, in contrast, is insensitive to G proteins and the additional tmAC regulator calmodulin as well as to the non-physiological diterpenic activator forskolin (11Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 12Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Instead, sAC is directly activated by calcium and the metabolite bicarbonate, rendering the enzyme an intracellular metabolic sensor (12Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 13Zippin J.H. Levin L.R. Buck J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 366-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Together, tmACs and sAC regulate a diverse set of essential biological processes such as differentiation and gene transcription. All mammalian ACs comprise two catalytic domains, and the crystal structure of a tmAC enzyme revealed that these domains, C1 and C2, are structurally similar (14Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The C1C2 heterodimer therefore resembles a homodimer, and the shared active site at the dimer interface has a pseudo-symmetric site that is catalytically inactive due to the lack of several catalytic residues. This pseudo-active site is partially exploited by the non-physiological tmAC activator forskolin. By solving crystal structures of the cyanobacterial sAC homolog CyaC, we recently showed that sAC enzymes, despite their unique regulation, have the same overall structure as tmACs and employ the same two-metal ion mechanism for catalysis (15Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Steegborn C. Litvin T.N. Levin L.R. Buck J. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The biological importance of AC enzymes calls for AC inhibitors, but there are currently no potent specific inhibitors known. The best characterized AC inhibitors are the so-called P-site inhibitors that occupy the binding site for the substrate ATP, show low AC isoform specificity, and bear the potential to bind to a large number of cellular nucleotide-binding proteins (17Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 205-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A second class of AC inhibitors, which contain an adenine linked to ion chelators, suffers from the same predicament (18Levy D.E. Bao M. Cherbavaz D.B. Tomlinson J.E. Sedlock D.M. Homcy C.J. Scarborough R.M. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There are currently no efficient AC inhibitors that bind to a site other than the ATP-binding pocket and which would therefore promise a higher specificity for AC enzymes and among AC isoforms. Given that CEs inhibited cAMP production in cell extracts rich in sAC (19Braun T. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 194: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanism of CE action. We found that CEs directly bind to and inhibit the catalytic domains of class III AC enzymes non-competitively with respect to ATP. The crystal structure of the trimeric complex between the catalytic domain of CyaC, an ATP analog, and a CE identifies a hydrophobic patch at the dimer center as the first AC inhibitor-binding site outside the active site. The adjacent hydroxyls of the CE inhibitor capture the catalytic magnesium ion via a pincer-like interaction and displace it from its “catalytic” position. This novel inhibitor-binding site shows variations between different AC isoforms, indicating its potential use for the development of highly specific AC inhibitors. Protein Purification and Activity Assay—[α-32P]ATP and [3H]cAMP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, estrogen and derivatives were from Steraloids, and all other chemicals came from Sigma. A glutathione S-transferase fusion of human sAC (20Litvin T.N. Kamenetsky M. Zarifyan A. Buck J. Levin L.R. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were expressed and purified as described previously. Residues 998–1202 and 1005–1202, respectively, of CyaC from Spirulina platensis were expressed and purified with an N-terminal His tag as described (16Steegborn C. Litvin T.N. Levin L.R. Buck J. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The protein was stored at -80 °C for later crystallization trials, and protein for activity assays was supplemented with 50% (v/v) glycerol and stored at -20 °C. Individual mammalian adenylyl cyclase isoforms 1 (bovine), 2 (rat), and 5 (dog) were recombinantly expressed in Sf9 cells, and the adenylyl cyclase-containing membranes were prepared as described (22Taussig R. Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cyclase assays were performed in 100 μl of total volume in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with [α-32P]ATP as substrate and 10 mm MgCl2. Assays for sAC activity were supplemented with 50 mm bicarbonate, and those for CyaC were also supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2; reactions with tmAC VII were supplemented with purified Gsα protein (kind gift of Shengyu Yang), 10 mm NaF, and 30 μm AlF3. Indicated amounts of catechol estrogen were added using 100 mm stock solutions in methanol. Assays were started by adding purified tmAC VII C1 plus C2, human GST-sAC, and CyaC-(998–1202), respectively. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding 200 μl of 2% SDS. [α-32P]cAMP was recovered using a two-column method described previously (23Salomon Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 35-55PubMed Google Scholar). Mixtures of equal amounts of sample and scintillation fluid were counted for 1 min in a Beckman scintillation counter. Initial velocity measurements were made under conditions where the conversion of [α-32P]ATP did not exceed 10%. Activity values are the averages of at least three independent determinations. Adenylyl cyclase activity of Sf9 membrane preparations was measured using the procedure described by Smigel (24Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were performed for 12 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 μg of membrane protein, 100 μm forskolin, 10 mm MgCl2, and the indicated concentration of the inhibitor. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—CyaC-(1005–1202) was crystallized in complex with the ATP analog α,β-methylene-adenosine-5′-triphosphate (α,β-Me-ATP) by mixing 1 μl of protein solution (6 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm α,β-Me-ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm CaCl2) with 1 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrating against a 0.4-ml reservoir (100 mm cacodylate/NaOH, pH 6.7, 6% (v/v) isopropanol, and 11% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000). Crystal plates of ∼150 × 100 × 10 μm3 were soaked with 5 mm 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-CE) for 10 min. Soaked crystals were frozen 60 s after the addition of two drop volumes of cryoprotectant solution (25% (v/v) isopropanol in reservoir solution supplemented with 5 mm 2-CE). A complete data set was collected at 100 K at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's beamline X4A (Table I). Diffraction data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. DENZO: A Film Processing Program for Macromolecular Crystallography. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). Soaking with 2-CE changed the initial space group of the α,β-Me-ATP complex from P212121 with two monomers in the asymmetric unit to P21 with four monomers in the asymmetric unit.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsCyaC + α,β-ATP + 2-CESpace groupP21Unit cell constantsa = 53.4 Å; b = 70.2 Å; c = 106.7 Å; β = 96.0°Resolution (Å)38.2–2.3Unique reflections35,639〈I/σ〉8.7Completeness (outermost shell)98.5% (97.5%)RmergeaRmerge = Σ(I – 〈I〉)/ΣI; I is the intensity of an individual measurement, and 〈I〉 is the corresponding mean value (outermost shell)6.3% (35.2%)Resolution range for refinement (Å)15.0–2.3Total reflections used28,605Number of atoms in asymmetric unitProtein6013Ligands174Water139Root mean square deviationsBond length (Å)0.01Bond angles (°)1.2Bonded B-factors (Å2)1.8Average B-factor (Å2)35.9Final R/RfreebR-factor = Σ||Fobs| – k|Fcalc||/Σ|Fobs|; |Fobs| is the observed and |Fcalc| the calculated structure factor amplitude,cRfree was calculated from 7% of the measured reflections omitted from refinement (%)20.7/25.7a Rmerge = Σ(I – 〈I〉)/ΣI; I is the intensity of an individual measurement, and 〈I〉 is the corresponding mean valueb R-factor = Σ||Fobs| – k|Fcalc||/Σ|Fobs|; |Fobs| is the observed and |Fcalc| the calculated structure factor amplitudec Rfree was calculated from 7% of the measured reflections omitted from refinement Open table in a new tab Structure Solution and Analysis—The structure was solved by using Patterson search techniques with the program MOLREP (26Vagin A.

The model was refined by simulated annealing and conjugate gradient minimization with CNS (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden1991Google Scholar). An overall anisotropic B-factor and bulk solvent correction were applied to the data. In a later stage of refinement, individual isotropic Debye-Waller factors were refined. The final refined model of the CyaC·α,β-Me-ATP/2-CE complex comprises residues 1002–1199 (monomer A), 1004–1108 and 1112–1199 (monomer B), 1004–1199 (monomer C), and 1005–1107 and 1110–1199 (monomer D) with 89.6% of the residues in the most favored Ramachandran plot regions and no residues in disallowed regions. The model further contains one α,β-Me-ATP molecule and two metal ions per monomer, a total of 139 solvent atoms, and one 2-CE molecule in monomer A and B, respectively. For analysis and comparison of the structure, O, CNS, and LSQMAN (29Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. ESF/CCP4 Newsletter. 1994; 31: 9-14Google Scholar) were used.

CEs such as 2-CE, 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-CE), and 2-hydroxyestrone inhibited recombinant human sAC in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In contrast the parent compounds estrone and estrogen did not influence the enzymatic activity. The inhibition was reversible (data not shown), and the IC50 values are in the low micromolar range. The cyanobacterial sAC enzyme CyaC was inhibited by 2-CE (the major form of CE) and 4-CE with similar efficacy (Fig. 2B and Supplemental Fig. 3, available in the on-line version of this article). To reveal whether CEs can also act on tmACs, we first used membrane preparations of insect cells overexpressing human full-length tmACs I, II, and V, respectively. The adenylyl cyclase activity assays showed that CE inhibited the generation of cAMP by these membrane preparations in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2C and Supplemental Fig. 1, available in the on-line version of this article). We then performed the enzymatic assay with purified soluble catalytic domains of human tmAC VII (21Yan S.Z. Tang W.J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which showed that 2-CE inhibited the enzyme with an IC50 value of ∼2 μm (Fig. 2D). These results show that CEs are general inhibitors of class III AC activity and that they act directly on the AC enzymes. The increased IC50 values in our experiments with membrane preparations are likely artifacts due to insertion of the hydrophobic inhibitor into the membrane, which lowers the effective concentration of the compound. 2-CE Is Not Competitive with Respect to ATP and Binds to a Novel Hydrophobic Patch Next to the Active Site—To determine the mode of inhibition of CEs, we assayed adenylyl cyclase activity of CyaC as a function of ATP and 2-CE concentrations, which indicated that 2-CE inhibits the enzyme non-competitively with respect to the substrate ATP (Fig. 3A). This suggests that CEs do not bind to the hydrophobic adenosine recognition pocket of the active site. In addition, CEs do not appear to utilize the known forskolin-binding pocket, the degenerate site pseudo-symmetrically related to the active site in C1C2 heterodimeric ACs. This conclusion is drawn from the observation that CEs are equally potent at inhibiting homodimeric CyaC, which does not have the degenerate site. Therefore, we hypothesized that CEs may interact with an unknown binding site on AC enzymes. To identify the CE-binding site and determine the molecular mechanism of CE inhibition, we solved the crystal structure of CyaC in complex with 2-CE and the ATP analog α,β-Me-ATP (Table I). Two inhibitor molecules, one per active site, interact symmetrically with a hydrophobic patch at the central depression of the dimer, adjacent to the active sites (Fig. 3B). The two molecules of the ATP analog α,β-Me-ATP still occupy the two active sites located at the dimer interface (16Steegborn C. Litvin T.N. Levin L.R. Buck J. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 34Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), as they do in the absence of 2-CE. Although the depression at the dimer center is a prominent feature of the wreath-like structure of class III cyclases, it has not been shown previously to interact with any regulators. The identification of this site as the CE-binding site qualifies it as a novel inhibitor-binding site. There are two dimers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, one with both of these binding sites occupied by 2-CE molecules and one without any bound inhibitor. No obvious reasons could be identified for this difference, such as lack of accessibility due to crystal lattice interactions. The central helix α4 (Asn-1146, Ala-1149, Arg-1150, Gln1152, and Glu1153), the active site strands β2 and β3 (Val-1059, Ala-1062, and Val-1059*; where the asterisk (*) indicates the partner monomer within the dimer), and the neighboring strand β1 (Phe-1015 and Asp-1017) accommodate the non-polar ring system of 2-CE by interacting with its flat surface and edges (Fig. 3C). The other flat side of the inhibitor shows limited interaction with the protein; instead, in the CyaC complex this side faces the 2-CE molecule bound to the partner monomer and possibly forms weak hydrophobic interactions. However, we did not observe pronounced cooperativity in 2-CE inhibition of CyaC, suggesting that this interaction does not contribute significantly to 2-CE binding and inhibition. The potential cooperative behavior seen against soluble tmAC domains was not confirmed by our experiments with tmAC-containing membranes. This lack of cooperativity is also more consistent with the assumption that only one CE molecule can bind to a catalytic heterodimer (see below). In the CyaC·2-CE complex, the end of 2-CE distal to the catechol moiety also interacts with the adenine ring and the sugar from the symmetric active site; the interaction is fairly localized, centering at C16 of 2-CE. 2-CE Captures the Catalytic Ion to Inactivate the Enzyme— Comparison of the CyaC·α,β-Me-ATP complex structures with and without 2-CE reveals that this compound exploits a general feature of class III AC enzymes for inhibition. The active site of these enzymes comprises two divalent metal ions in the so-called ion A and ion B sites. The ion A site harbors a catalytic magnesium ion that acidifies the ribose 3′ hydroxyl and stabilizes the transition state, whereas the ion B serves as an anchoring point for ATP by coordinating and stabilizing its β and γ phosphates (15Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Steegborn C. Litvin T.N. Levin L.R. Buck J. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The two adjacent hydroxyl groups of 2-CE coordinate the magnesium ion at the A site (distances 2.2 and 2.5 Å, respectively) like a pair of pincers (Fig. 3D), stabilizing this ion at 3 Å away from its original position and preventing its participation in catalysis. In contrast, the position of ion B did not change significantly. The two adjacent inhibitor hydroxyls are also part of a hydrogen bond network involving Glu-1153, Asp-1017, and a γ-phosphate oxygen of the substrate analog (Fig. 3D). In addition, the 17-hydroxyl group of 2-CE is in H-bond distance to Asn-1146. In the 2-CE-inhibited structure, the α-phosphate of the ATP analog exhibits a non-productive conformation not suitable for in-line attack, likely as a result of the coordination of its β- and γ-phosphate oxygen atoms to the shifted ion A. This change in phosphate conformation is also accompanied by active site closure (Fig. 4A), reflected in the movement of helix α1 by ∼4 Å and the movement of the small sheet β7/β8 by 2 Å toward the dimer center (16Steegborn C. Litvin T.N. Levin L.R. Buck J. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 34Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Although active site closure is also a prominent feature of productive catalysis, the conformation of the phosphates and the ion positions renders the enzyme inactive rather than active. The importance of the observed inhibitor-ion interaction suggests that only one CE molecule binds to heterodimeric mammalian ACs (all known tmACs and sAC). Although the pocket analog to the CE binding site exists on both C1 and C2, the inhibitor likely occupies only the pocket on the surface of C1 that connects to the active site rather than the degenerate site, which lacks the ion-binding aspartates. Without the metal ion interactions, the affinity of the inhibitor to the C2 site will be predictably much lower. In addition, placing 2-CE to the C2 pocket of tmACs would create steric hindrance to the bound forskolin, which interacts with tmACs at nanomolar affinity (35Dessauer C.W. Scully T.T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22272-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The addition of 100 μm forskolin, however, has no effect on the inhibition by 2-CE (Supplemental Fig. 2, available in the on-line version of this article). The importance of the 2-CE-ion interaction also suggests that 4-CE binds 180° rotated along its long axis, which would keep its hydrophobic part in the non-polar binding cleft and position its hydroxyl groups similarly to those of 2-CE for ion binding. The CE Binding Site Contains Both Conserved and Variable Elements—The CE-binding site is largely formed by a surface depression at the center of the dimeric class III AC enzymes that is present in all known crystal structures of this enzyme family (14Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 16Steegborn C. Litvin T.N. Levin L.R. Buck J. Wu H. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Essen L.O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the existence of the patch is conserved, a sequence comparison between CyaC and the mammalian heterodimeric ACs (Supplemental Fig. 4, available in the on-line version of this paper) shows that among residues directly in contact with 2-CE, only one is strictly conserved in the analogous C1 patch (residue Asp-1017), five are mostly conserved (Phe-1015, Val-1059, Ala-1062, Gln-1152, and Ala-1149), and the remaining three (Asn-1146, Arg-1150, and Glu-1153) are highly variable (Fig. 4B). Almost all contacts between the protein and the mainly hydrophobic inhibitor are apolar, with the exception of polar interactions with the 2-, 3-, and 17-hydroxyls in 2-CE. The dominance of hydrophobic contacts in CE binding rationalizes the observed promiscuity of CEs for the different AC isoforms. However, the inhibitor-binding pocket is formed and flanked by several variable polar residues (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the CE-binding site bears the potential for a more specific inhibition that has not been fully exploited by CEs. In addition, the observed CE/enzyme interaction shows a non-ideal shape complementarity, indicating another factor that could be exploited to yield more effective and specific AC inhibitors. The CE Inhibition Mechanism Predicts the Binding Mode for Other AC Inhibitors—The mode of AC inhibition by 2-CE predicts that, as in a catechol moiety, two adjacent hydroxyl groups coupled to a hydrophobic scaffold are required for efficient AC binding and inhibition. This insight on the structural requirement of this class of AC inhibitors explains previous observations on a series of catechol estrogens and related physiological compounds on cAMP production from sAC-containing extracts (19Braun T. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 194: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Those that contain a catechol moiety (2-CE, 4-CE, 2-hydroxyestrone, apomorphine, catechol, dopamine, l-dopa, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol) inhibited sAC activity, although with varying efficacies depending on the hydrophobicity of the compound parts linked to the catechol ring system (Supplemental Fig. 5, available in the on-line version of this paper). In contrast, similar compounds that do not have two adjacent hydroxyl groups (tyrosine, phenylephrine, estradiol, and 6α-hydroxyestradiol) are much less effective (∼100 x). More recently two other AC inhibitors, tyrphostins (38Jaleel M. Shenoy A.R. Visweswariah S.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8247-8255Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and calmidazolium (39Haunso A. Simpson J. Antoni F.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), were identified as being non-competitive with ATP. Tyrphostins are a family of aromatic tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The tyrphostins effective in AC inhibition also possess a catechol moiety and likely use similar molecular mechanisms for AC inhibition as those observed here for CEs. A model of the most effective tyrphostin A25 bound to CyaC may be generated without creating steric clash by superposition of the tyrphostin on the CE of the CyaC·2-CE complex (Fig. 4C). Calmidazolium is a largely hydrophobic calcium chelator, suggesting it might also exploit the same binding site and inhibition mechanism, although the details of this interaction are more difficult to predict from the CE-bound CyaC structure. Therefore, it appears that the binding site identified from the CyaC·2-CE complex structure may be a common site utilized by an emerging family of non-competitive AC inhibitors. The 10 mammalian AC subclasses control diverse sets of essential physiological processes, rendering them interesting targets for therapeutic intervention. Successful drug development based on this target has to date been limited, however, as most known AC inhibitors bind to the enzyme's ATP binding site (10Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 17Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 205-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These nucleotide mimics tend to bind to a wide range of nucleotide-binding proteins, potentially causing many unwanted side effects (e.g. the potent P-site inhibitor 3′-dATP also inhibits DNA polymerase) (40Englund P.T. Huberman J.A. Jovin T.M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3038-3044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This binding mode thus promises little opportunity for specific inhibition of ACs or AC subclasses. In contrast, inhibitors binding outside the active site (allosteric inhibitors) tend to exploit more specific features of a target protein and have been described, e.g. for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (41Wiesmann C. Barr K.J. Kung J. Zhu J. Erlanson D.A. Shen W. Fahr B.J. Zhong M. Taylor L. Randal M. McDowell R.S. Hansen S.K. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Today. 2004; 9: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Examples of the successful application of this principle to drug development are the non-nucleoside inhibitors (nevirapine, delavirdine, and efavirenz) of reverse transcriptase (43Esnouf R. Ren J. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and the inhibition of chemokine receptors by Repertaxin (44Bertini R. Allegretti M. Bizzarri C. Moriconi A. Locati M. Zampella G. Cervellera M.N. Di Cioccio V. Cesta M.C. Galliera E. Martinez F.O. Di Bitondo R. Troiani G. Sabbatini V. D'Anniballe G. Anacardio R.

A. 2004; 101: 11791-11796Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The CE-binding pocket described here constitutes a novel ligand-binding site in AC enzymes specific to this protein family. Sequence variations in this binding pocket indicate that it constitutes a promising starting point for the development of inhibitors specific to ACs and even to AC subclasses. Adding a hydroxymethyl group at 2-CE position 1, for example, would yield a compound compatible with the tmAC V-binding site but incompatible with CyaC and sAC (Fig. 4D). In addition, the non-ideal complementarity between 2-CE and its binding site suggests that modifications may be made to the estrogen scaffold to increase both specificity and affinity. Consistently, compound classes completely different from the steroids seem to be able to exploit the CE-binding site and inhibition mechanism. Tyrphostins (38Jaleel M. Shenoy A.R. Visweswariah S.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8247-8255Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as epinephrine and related compounds inhibiting ACs (19Braun T. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Kamenetsky, T. E. McGraw, J. Buck, and L. R. Levin, submitted for publication. finally, are AC inhibitors that lack any structural similarity to CEs. This structural diversity indicates that a large set of compounds and modifications should be considered in order to identify inhibitors that further exploit the subclass-specific features of this binding site and can potentially serve as highly specific AC-targeted drugs. Are CEs physiological regulators of ACs? The affinity of the compounds we tested indicates that AC inhibition can contribute to their physiological effects in tissues with elevated CE levels. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other unknown physiological compounds with a hydrophobic scaffold might exploit the CE-binding site and constitute physiological AC regulators of higher efficacy and specificity. This situation resembles the findings for the tmAC-activating diterpene forskolin isolated from plant extracts (46Tang W.J. Hurley J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Its hydrophobic binding cleft is conserved in eight of the nine human tmAC subclasses, but a physiological ligand, probably displaying higher specificity, has not yet been identified. In summary, we described here CEs as novel, non-competitive inhibitors of AC enzymes. The crystal structure of a sAC·CE complex reveals that the inhibitor binds to a pocket near to the active site and “hijacks” the catalytic magnesium ion, a mechanism that likely also applies to the CE inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase (47Lloyd T. Weisz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4841-4843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 5-lipoxygenase (48Alanko J. Sievi E. Lahteenmaki T. Mucha I. Vapaatalo H. Parantainen J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Variations in the inhibitor-binding pockets of the various AC isoforms suggest that exploiting this pocket might enable the development of highly specific AC-targeted drugs. We thank R.

https://openalex.org/W2024230991,"Vaccinia virus (VV) has many mechanisms to suppress and modulate the host immune response. The VV protein A52R was previously shown to act as an intracellular inhibitor of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) signaling by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that A52R interacted with both tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (IRAK2). The effect of A52R on signals other than NFκB was not determined. Here, we show that A52R does not inhibit TLR-induced p38 or c-Jun amino N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen activating protein (MAP) kinase activation. Rather, A52R could drive activation of these kinases. Two lines of evidence suggested that the A52R/TRAF6 interaction was critical for these effects. First, A52R-induced p38 MAP kinase activation was inhibited by overexpression of the TRAF domain of TRAF6, which sequestered A52R and inhibited its interaction with endogenous TRAF6. Second, a truncated version of A52R, which interacted with IRAK2 and not TRAF6, was unable to activate p38. Because interleukin 10 (IL-10) production is strongly p38-dependent, we examined the effect of A52R on IL-10 gene induction. A52R was found to be capable of inducing the IL-10 promoter through a TRAF6-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, A52R enhanced lipopolysaccharide/TLR4-induced IL-10 production, while inhibiting the TLR-induced NFκB-dependent genes IL-8 and RANTES. These results show that although A52R inhibits NFκB activation by multiple TLRs it can simultaneously activate MAP kinases. A52R-mediated enhancement of TLR-induced IL-10 may be important to virulence, given the role of IL-10 in immunoregulation.

To date, 13 members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. The TLRs belong to a superfamily that includes the interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptors. This family share significant homology in their cytoplasmic regions, which is defined by the presence of a Toll-IL-1 receptor-resistance domain (TIR) (1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). Similar to the IL-1R, engagement of the TLRs with their ligands leads to activation of several intracellular signal transduction pathways, culminating in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), of chemokines such as IL-8 and RANTES (2Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 (3Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R. Coffman R.L. O'Garra A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 683-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (5364) Google Scholar). Among the most prominent and best characterized of these intracellular signaling pathways are those leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the transcription factor NFκB. Triggering of the IL-1R or of TLRs causes TIR adaptor molecules to be recruited to the receptor complex such as MyD88 (4Janssens S. Beyaert R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 474-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and TIR domain containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF) (5Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K.

Crozat K. Sovath S. Han J. Beutler B. Nature. 2003; 424: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) such as IRAK1, IRAK2, and IRAK4 are activated, which then engage with TRAF6, ultimately activating the IκB kinase complex. This complex phosphorylates the inhibitory molecule IκB, which leads to NFκB entering the nucleus and inducing target gene expression (7Akira S. Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Activation of TRAF6 also results in the activation of TAK1 and subsequent activation of MAP kinases (p42/p44, p38, and JNK). The TLR family is now known to be important in sensing and responding to viruses. Double-stranded RNA is a molecular pattern associated with viral infection, and TLR3 has been shown to sensitize cells to activation by poly(I:C) a synthetic double-stranded RNA analogue (8Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). Other TLRs involved in sensing viral infection include TLR7 and TLR8, which detect single-stranded RNA from influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (9Diebold S.S.

Further evidence for a role for TLRs in responding to viruses comes from the fact that proteins from VV have been identified that can block TLR function (13Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J.A.

The VV genome contains numerous genes encoding proteins involved in immunomodulation and immunoevasion. For example, the virus encodes proteins that act as decoy receptors for IL-1, IL-18, and TNF (17Tortorella D. Gewurz B.E. Furman M.H. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 861-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). VV is a member of the Poxviridae, a family of complex DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of vertebrate and invertebrate cells. The most notorious member, variola virus, causes smallpox. This disease was eradicated using prophylactic inoculations with the antigenically related VV (18Moss B. Knipe D.M. Griffin D.E. Chanock R.M. Lamb R.A. Lamb M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. 2. Lippincott-Raven, New York2001: 2849-2883Google Scholar). One VV protein implicated in the evasion of the host TLR response is A52R. A role for A52R in VV virulence has been clearly established in that deletion of a52r from VV led to an attenuated virus in a murine intranasal infection (15Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A52R was shown to be capable of interacting with IRAK2 and TRAF6 and to block every IL-1R-TLR pathway to NFκB activation tested (13Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J.A. Smith G.L. Dower S.K. O'Neill L.A.

J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, the effect of A52R on signals other than NFκB has not been determined. Given that many viral proteins have multiple activities and that other intracellular effects of A52R might contribute to its role in virulence, we tested the effect of A52R on signals other than NFκB. Here we show that A52R can activate the MAP kinases p38 and JNK in a TRAF6-dependent manner. In addition, A52R leads to enhancement of the TLR-induced p38-dependent gene IL-10. In contrast, inhibition of the TLR-induced NFκB-dependent genes IL-8 and RANTES is observed. These results highlight the ability of A52R to differentially modulate TLR signaling. This ability of A52R to activate p38 and potentiate TLR-induced IL-10 may be important to its role in virulence. Expression and Reporter Plasmids—CD4-TLR4 was a kind gift from R.

Data are expressed as mean -fold induction ± S.D. relative to control levels, for a representative experiment from a minimum of three separate experiments, each preformed in triplicate. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HEK 293T cells (1.5 × 106) were seeded into 10-cm dishes 24 h prior to transfection. Transfections were carried out using GeneJuice™. For coimmunoprecipitations, 4 μg of each construct were transfected. Where only one construct was transfected the total amount of DNA (8 μg) was kept constant by supplementation with pcDNA3.1. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 850 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% (v/v) aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). For immunoprecipitation, the indicated antibodies were precoupled to either protein A-Sepharose (polyclonal and FLAG monoclonal antibodies) or protein G-Sepharose beads (all other monoclonal antibodies) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice in lysis buffer and incubated with the cell lysates overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed, boiled with 30 μl of 3× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and analyzed using standard SDS-PAGE and Western blotting techniques. For analysis of p38 MAP kinase activation by Western blot, a specific antibody raised against phosphorylated p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) was employed. Total levels of p38 MAP kinase protein were also analyzed using anti-p38 MAP kinase antibody. HEK 293 cells (1 × 105 cells per well) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected 24 h later with ΔTRAF6 or A52R encoding plasmids as indicated, using GeneJuice™. The total amount of DNA (2.3 μg) was kept constant by supplementation with pcDNA3.1. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes, and probed with the indicated antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. Determination of Cytokine Concentrations—HEK 293 clonal cell lines stably expressing either TLR4/MD-2 (HEK-TLR4) or TLR3 (HEK-TLR3) (21Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R. Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B. Pitha P.M. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) or the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 were used for determination of cytokine production. Cells (2 × 104 cell per well) were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected 24 h later with an expression plasmid encoding A52R, TRAF6, or ΔTRAF6 using GeneJuice™ where indicated. 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS or 25 μg/ml poly(I:C). 2 h prior to stimulation the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 was added were indicated. After 24 h supernatants were harvested, and IL-8, RANTES, or IL-10 concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Biosystems). Experiments were performed three times in triplicate, and data are expressed as mean ± S.D. from one representative experiment. A52R Drives p38 MAP Kinase Activation—We previously showed that deletion of the vaccinia virus a52r gene reduced virus virulence in a murine intranasal infection model, that A52R acts as a potent inhibitor of NFκB activation induced by IL-1 and various TLRs, and that it was capable of interacting with both TRAF6 and IRAK2 (15Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, the effect of A52R on signals other than NFκB was not determined and thus there might be other functions of A52R that also contribute to virulence. Therefore, here we examined the effect of A52R on p38 MAP kinase activation. For this we used the Stratagene Path-Detect™ System that is based on the ability of p38 MAP kinase to phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor CHOP. This is assayed by an increase in the ability of the Gal4-CHOP fusion protein to transactivate the pFR luciferase reporter, which contains Gal4 binding sites in its promoter. Fig. 1A shows that treatment of cells with IL-1, ectopic expression of CD4-TLR4, or ectopic expression of TLR3 together with poly(I:C) stimulation led to activation of p38 MAP kinase. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of increasing amounts of a plasmid encoding A52R enhanced IL-1-, CD4-TLR4-, and TLR3-mediated p38 MAP kinase activation (Fig. 1A). This was in contrast to the inhibitory effect of A52R on IL-1/TLR-induced NFκB activation (Fig. 1B and Refs. 13Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J.A. Smith G.L. Dower S.K. O'Neill L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10162-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar and 15Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In fact, expression of A52R alone in unstimulated cells led to both p38 MAP kinase and JNK activation (Fig. 1C), whereas A52R alone had no effect on basal levels of NFκB activity (not shown). Thus, A52R has opposite effects on IL-1/TLR-induced NFκB and MAP kinase activation and can in fact activate MAP kinases in the absence of any other stimulus. Activation of p38 by A52R Requires Interaction with TRAF6— Activation of p38 by A52R could conceivably be because of its ability to interact with either IRAK2 or TRAF6 (15Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was the case, we began to generate truncated versions of A52R to map the sites of interaction between A52R and TRAF6 and IRAK2. A truncated version of A52R lacking 46 amino acids at the C-terminal was constructed (Fig. 2A). This truncated A52R protein, here termed ΔA52R, was detectable by the anti-A52R antibody and was expressed at similar levels to A52R (Fig. 2, B and C). To determine whether ΔA52R was still capable of interacting with TRAF6 and/or IRAK2, co-immunoprecipitations were carried out. ΔA52R was unable to form a complex with TRAF6 but retained its ability to interact with IRAK2. A co-immunoprecipitation with anti-TRAF6 antibody pulled down A52R with both endogenous TRAF6 (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 1) and overexpressed TRAF6 (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 3). In contrast, under the same conditions ΔA52R was not detected in complex with either endogenous or overexpressed TRAF6 (Fig. 2B, top panel, lanes 4 and 6). However, a clear interaction between ΔA52R and IRAK2 was observed (Fig. 2C). The ability of ΔA52R and A52R to form a complex with IRAK2 appeared equal (Fig. 2C, top panels, compare lanes 3 and 6). Next, the ability of ΔA52R to induce MAP kinase activation was tested. Fig. 2D shows that in contrast to A52R, ΔA52R failed to drive p38 and JNK activation. Thus, the failure of ΔA52R to activate p38 and JNK correlated with its inability to interact with TRAF6, suggesting a role for TRAF6 in the stimulatory effect of A52R on MAP kinases. A52R Activates p38 via the TRAF Domain of TRAF6 —We next sought to examine more closely how the interaction between A52R and TRAF6 was responsible for the p38 MAP kinase activation. Fig. 3A shows that consistent with previous work (15Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), A52R interacted with the TRAF domain of TRAF6 (amino acids 289–522). The TRAF domain of TRAF6, here termed ΔTRAF6, has been reported to act as a dominant negative, inhibiting IL-1-induced p38 and JNK activation (22Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that if the A52R-TRAF domain interaction was important for A52R-induced p38 activation, overexpression of ΔTRAF6 would sequester A52R and prevent p38 MAP kinase activation. To test this we examined p38 activation by Western blot analysis in HEK 293 cells using a phospho-specific p38 antibody. Fig. 3B shows that transfection of cells with ΔTRAF6 alone had no effect on levels of phospho-p38 (upper panel, lane 2). Consistent with the reporter gene based assay (Fig. 1), overexpression of A52R led to an increase in phospho-p38 (Fig. 3B, upper panel, compare lane 3 to lane 1), whereas ΔA52R expression had no effect on phospho-p38 (not shown). Co-expression of ΔTRAF6 with A52R completely inhibited A52R-mediated p38 activation (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 4). As a control, A52R was shown to have no effect on IκBα protein levels (Fig. 3B, third panel), and similarly did not lead to an increase in IκBα phosphorylation (not shown). Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activation by overexpression of ΔTRAF6 was likely because of ΔTRAF6 sequestering A52R and preventing its interaction with endogenous TRAF6. Fig. 3C shows this to be the case because the presence of overexpressed ΔTRAF6 inhibited the interaction of A52R with endogenous TRAF6 (compare lanes 4 and 2). Thus A52R activates p38 by engaging the TRAF domain of TRAF6. A52R Enhances TLR-induced IL-10 Induction While Inhibiting NFκB-dependent Genes—Previous studies have shown that LPS-induced IL-10 production is p38 dependent (23Foey A.D. Parry S.L. Williams L.M. Feldmann M. Foxwell B.M. Brennan F.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 920-928PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ma W. Lim W. Gee K. Aucoin S. Nandan D. Kozlowski M. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13664-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered whether A52R would have an effect on IL-10 induction. We first examined the effect of A52R on the IL-10 promoter using a reporter gene assay. Interestingly, A52R was capable of driving the IL-10 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In contrast, A52R expression did not affect the basal activity of a range of NFκB-dependent promoters, including IL-8, RANTES, and interferon-β (not shown). To examine whether the induction of the IL-10 promoter was TRAF6-dependent, we next assessed the ability of ΔTRAF6 to inhibit A52R-mediated IL-10 induction. Fig. 4B shows that a single dose of ΔTRAF6 was capable of negating the stimulatory effect of A52R on the IL-10 promoter. In addition, A52R failed to activate the IL-10 reporter in TRAF6–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In the absence of TRAF6, the ability of A52R to drive the IL-10 promoter was abolished compared with a 3-fold induction in normal MEFs (Fig. 4C), thus implicating TRAF6 in the activation of the IL-10 promoter by A52R. We next used the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 to analyze the effect of A52R-induced IL-10 protein production. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 has previously been shown to inhibit LPS/TLR4-induced IL-10 production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (23Foey A.D. Parry S.L. Williams L.M. Feldmann M. Foxwell B.M. Brennan F.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 920-928PubMed Google Scholar) and in the human monocyte cell line THP-1 (24Ma W. Lim W. Gee K. Aucoin S. Nandan D. Kozlowski M. Diaz-Mitoma F. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13664-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, here SB203580 inhibited LPS-induced IL-10 production (Fig. 5A, right panel). Expression of A52R alone did not lead to IL-10 production in unstimulated cells (Fig. 5A, left panel). However, expression of A52R strongly enhanced LPS-induced IL-10 production (Fig. 5A, left panel). This is suggestive of a potent effect on TLR-induced IL-10 production given that only a small fraction (3% on average, not shown) of the RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by LPS to release IL-10 would be expected to be expressing A52R in this transient transfection system. The fact that A52R failed to drive the IL-10 promoter in TRAF6–/– MEFs suggested that the TRAF6-A52R interaction was critical for the effect of A52R on IL-10 production. This conclusion prompted us to examine the role of TRAF6 on LPS-induced IL-10 production. Consistent with the effect of A52R on LPS-induced IL-10, ectopic expression of TRAF6 enhanced (Fig. 5B, left panel), whereas ΔTRAF6 inhibited (Fig. 5B, right panel), LPS-induced IL-10 production. Next we sought to compare the effect of A52R on IL-10 induction to its effects on two NFκB-dependent genes, the chemokines IL-8 (25Jung Y.D. Fan F. McConkey D.J. Jean M.E. Liu W. Reinmuth N. Stoeltzing O. Ahmad S.A. Parikh A.A. Mukaida N. Ellis L.M. Cytokine. 2002; 18: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and RANTES (26Genin P. Algarte M. Roof P. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5352-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Stimulation of HEK-TLR4 cells with LPS led to IL-8 production, whereas stimulation of HEK-TLR3 cells with poly(I:C) led to RANTES production (Fig. 5C). In both cases transient transfection with A52R inhibited chemokine production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Thus A52R differentially modulates TLR-induced gene expression, by potentiating the p38-dependent gene IL-10, while inhibiting the NFκB-dependent genes IL-8 and RANTES.Fig. 5Differential effects of A52R on TLR-dependent gene induction. A, murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with 180 ng of plasmid encoding A52R, 24 h prior to stimulation with 1 μg/ml LPS (left panel).

Twenty-four hours after stimulation supernatants were harvested and assayed for IL-10 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Mutations in PRG4 cause the autosomal recessive, human disorder camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome. We developed rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human lubricin to determine the consequence of disease-causing mutations at the protein level and to study the protein's normal post-translational processing. Antiserum generated against an epitope in the amino-terminal portion of lubricin detected protein in wild-type synovial fluid and in conditioned media from wild-type cultured synoviocytes. However, the antiserum did not detect lubricin in synovial fluid or cultured synoviocytes from several patients with frameshift or nonsense mutations in PRG4. Antiserum generated against an epitope in the protein's carboxyl-terminal, hemopexin-like domain identified a post-translational cleavage event in wild-type lubricin, mediated by a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase (SPC). Interestingly, in contrast to wild-type lubricin, one disease-causing mutation that removes the last 8 amino acids of the protein, including a conserved cysteine residue, was not cleaved within the hemopexin-like domain when expressed in COS-7 cells.

Produced and secreted by synoviocytes and superficial zone chondrocytes, lubricin is present in synovial fluid and at the cartilage surface (3Schumacher B.L. Block J.A. Schmid T.M. Aydelotte M.B.

Functions attributed to lubricin within articulating joints include protection of cartilage surfaces from protein deposition and cell adhesion, inhibition of synovial cell overgrowth, and boundary lubrication at the articular cartilage surface (8Rhee D.K.

Analysis of the amino acid sequence of lubricin reveals that it is a paralog of vitronectin. Both proteins contain somatomedin B (SMB) 1The abbreviations used are: SMB, somatomedin B-like; PEX, hemopexin-like; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; SPC, subtilisin-like proprotein convertase; CACP, camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome; HA, hemagglutinin; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; SZP, superficial zone protein; OA, osteoarthritis. and hemopexin-like (PEX) domains (6Merberg D. Fitz L. Temple P. Preissner K. Rosenblattt S. Kost C. Wegerhoff J. Mosher D. Biology of Vitronectins and Their Receptors. Elsevier Science Publishers BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1993: 45-54Google Scholar). In the case of vitronectin, the SMB domain was shown to regulate protein binding to the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and to plasminogen activator inhibitor (9Schroeck F. Arroyo de Prada N. Sperl S. Schmitt M. Viktor M. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1143-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Sidenius N. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The binding of vitronectin to the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor is postulated to regulate cell surface plasminogen activation and cell adhesion (11Deng G. Curriden S.A. Hu G. Czekay R.P. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition to being present in vitronectin, PEX domains are also found in members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, where they mediate attachment to extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin (12Murphy G. Knauper V. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Cleavage by subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (SPCs) has been described for the PEX domains of vitronectin and MMPs, but the biological consequences of this processing event are unknown (13Seger D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36350-36357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Lubricin differs from vitronectin by also containing a large, central, extensively O-linked glycosylated, mucin-like domain (2Swann D.A. Silver F.H. Slayter H.S. Stafford W. Shore E. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Jay G.D. Tantravahi U. Britt D.E. Barrach H.J. Cha C.J. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The abundance of negatively charged sugars within this domain creates strong repulsive hydration forces that enable the protein to act as a boundary lubricant (16Jay G.D. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 28: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Mutations in PRG4 cause the rare, autosomal recessive disease camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome (CACP) (17Marcelino J. Carpten J.D. Suwairi W.M. Gutierrez O.M. Schwartz S.

Bahabri S.A. Trent J.M. Warman M.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Individuals with CACP have normal appearing joints at birth but with advancing age develop joint failure associated with noninflammatory synoviocyte hyperplasia and subintimal fibrosis of the synovial capsule (18Bahabri S.A.

Prg4 knock-out mice exhibit phenotypic features similar to patients with CACP and have severe joint pathology, including articular cartilage destruction and marked synovial cell overgrowth (8Rhee D.K.

Therefore, it appears that lubricin plays an essential role in maintaining healthy joint function and that CACP disease-causing mutations alter the ability of lubricin to perform this role. An allelic series of mutations within PRG4 have been identified in individuals with CACP (17Marcelino J. Carpten J.D. Suwairi W.M. Gutierrez O.M. Schwartz S. Robbins C. Sood R. Makalowska I.

These disease-causing mutations can be used to identify regions and/or protein processing events that are important for proper function. We developed polyclonal antibodies against two conserved domains within the amino and carboxyl-terminal regions of lubricin and utilized these antisera on patient-derived synovial fluid and cultured synoviocytes to identify the consequences of disease-causing mutations at the protein level. For one disease-causing mutation, in which affected tissue was unavailable, we expressed recombinant forms of wild-type and mutant protein in COS-7 cells and identified a specific cleavage event within the protein's PEX domain that appears essential to the protein's function. Collection of Synovial Fluid Aspirates and Cultured Synoviocytes from Patients with Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and CACP—CACP samples were obtained as discarded material at the time of diagnostic joint aspiration, synovial biopsy, or joint replacement surgery. All patients gave their informed consent. The Institutional Review Board of University Hospitals of Cleveland approved this project. Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis samples were obtained as discarded material at the time of diagnostic or therapeutic joint aspiration or joint replacement. Synovial fluid samples that were nonbloody in appearance were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and then stored frozen at -20 °C. Synoviocytes were recovered from synovial tissue by identifying the intimal surface of the tissue, dissecting it free of adjacent adventitial tissue, and then culturing the cells in the presence of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.4% collagenase (w/v) (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator. Nonadherent cells in these digested samples were centrifuged and washed three times in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B, all from Life Technologies). Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to ∼80% confluence and then split 1:3. Cells were then maintained in growth medium that contained 20% fetal bovine serum. Generation of Lubricin Expression Constructs—A pME18S vector, which expresses a common splice variant of mouse lubricin (Prg4) that lacks exons 2, 4, and 5 (19Ikegawa S. Sano M. Koshizuka Y. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 90: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), was generously provided by Dr. Shiro Ikegawa. To perform site-directed mutagenesis that will alter the carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) domain, we shuttled an ApaI and SpeI restriction fragment encoding this domain into pBluescript II SK (+) (Stratagene). All site-directed mutagenesis reactions were performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by utilizing the pBluescript construct as template unless otherwise noted. Clones confirmed to have site-directed changes by sequence analysis were then shuttled back into the pME18S vector. The following mutant constructs were generated: the disease-causing mutation that removes the final eight amino acid residues of lubricin (p.S1397X; using nomenclature for the human protein (17Marcelino J. Carpten J.D. Suwairi W.M. Gutierrez O.M. Schwartz S. Robbins C. Sood R. Makalowska I. Baxevanis A. Johnstone B. Laxer R.M. Zemel L. Kim C.A. Herd J.K. Ihle J. Williams C. Johnson M. Raman V. Alonso L.G. Brunoni D. Gerstein A. Papadopoulos N. Bahabri S.A. Trent J.M. Warman M.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar)) was created by mutating a CC dinucleotide to an AG dinucleotide at nucleotide residues 3139-3140 in the mouse cDNA. The disease-causing mutation that if translated would truncate the polypeptide in the middle of the 400-amino acid residue PEX domain (p.K1230fs; using nomenclature for the human protein) was created by deleting five nucleotides 2647-2651 in the mouse cDNA. To examine post-translational processing of the PEX domain, we added a single Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLGG) to the C terminus of lubricin (Lub-Myc construct). Additionally, constructs with amino acid residues Arg949 and Arg951 mutated to alanine residues (LubR949/951AMyc construct) or amino acids Arg949, Arg951, and Arg955 mutated to alanine residues (LubR949/951/955AMyc construct) were generated (using nomenclature for the mouse protein (19Ikegawa S. Sano M. Koshizuka Y. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 90: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). To determine which cysteine residues in the PEX domain were responsible for mediating intrachain disulfide bonding, the last cysteine (Lub-C1053A-Myc), the fourth cysteine (Lub-C930A-Myc), or the third cysteine (Lub-C853A-Myc) were changed to alanines in the Lub-Myc construct (using nomenclature for the mouse protein (19Ikegawa S. Sano M. Koshizuka Y. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 90: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). We also separately subcloned the PEX domain into a pcDNA3.1 expression vector that utilizes an immunoglobulin signal peptide with an amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope immediately following the signal peptide's cleavage site. Primers PEXF (5′-ACCGAATTCCTAGAAGTCATGCTGCCAA-3′) and PEXR (5′-GTCCTCGAGTTCAAGGACAGTTGTACCA-3′) were used to amplify the PEX domain from pME18S and subclone it into pcDNA3.1 using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites to create the HA-PEX construct. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on this construct to change the final cysteine (HA-C1053A), the second cysteine (HA-C851A), the second and third cysteines (HA-C851/853A), the first cysteine (HA-C795A), or the first and final cysteines (HA-C795/1053A) within the PEX domain to alanines (using nomenclature for the mouse protein (19Ikegawa S. Sano M. Koshizuka Y. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 90: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)). Generation of Rabbit Polyclonal Anti-lubricin Antisera—The polypeptide epitope (FESFERGRECDCDAQCKKYDK) representing amino acid residues 75-95 (within the second SMB domain of human lubricin), which is encoded by exon 3 of PRG4, was synthesized with a N-terminal cysteine residue (Princeton Biomolecules) and covalently linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This epitope is amino-terminal of the mucin-like domain, and the exon encoding this epitope is present in all lubricin mRNA splice forms identified by reverse transcription-PCR (15Jay G.D. Tantravahi U. Britt D.E. Barrach H.J. Cha C.J. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A rabbit was inoculated with the antigen, given booster inoculations, and then terminally bled (Covance). The resultant antiserum was termed J108N. A second polypeptide epitope (FERAIGPSQTHTIRIQYSPA) representing amino acid residues 1304-1323 (within the PEX domain of human lubricin), which is encoded by exon 10 of PRG4 was also synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine residue and covalently linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This epitope is C-terminal of the mucin-like domain and the SPC cleavage site within the PEX domain. Antiserum was generated as described above and termed J109C. Immunodection of Lubricin in Synovial Fluid or Cultured Synoviocytes—For analysis of lubricin in aspirated synovial fluid, 1 μl of synovial fluid was mixed with 19 μl of 2× Laemmli (sample loading) buffer and boiled for 5 min in the presence (i.e. reducing conditions) or absence (i.e. nonreducing conditions) of 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were electrophoresed on a 4-20% gradient Tris acetate SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then transferred onto Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.). For analysis of lubricin in cultured synoviocytes, synoviocytes were cultured to confluence in 100-mm plates in growth medium with 20% fetal bovine serum. Synovial cells were then trypsinized and plated in 6-well cell culture plates (Costar 3506) and allowed to grow to confluence. After the cells had reached confluence, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh growth medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Three days later, the medium was collected and cleared of debris by centrifugation at 1,800 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Ten μl of conditioned medium was mixed with 10 μl of 2× loading buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE as described above. Cell lysate was also collected by adding 350 μl of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8), scraping the cells, and centrifuging the lysate at 12,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Ten μl of the cell lysate supernatant and 10 μl of 2× sample loading buffer were mixed, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Lubricin was immunodetected using either J108N or J109C antiserum. Immunoblots were blocked for 1 h with 10% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and then incubated with either a 1:500 dilution of J108N or a 1:250 dilution of J109C in antibody buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 1 h. After three 5-min washes with RIPA buffer, blots were incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) in antibody buffer for 1 h and then washed again three times with RIPA buffer. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL Plus chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and Immunodetection of Recombinant Lubricin and Lubricin Subdomains—COS-7 cells were cultured in growth medium. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to ∼80% confluence and transfected with 40 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 5 μg of plasmid DNA in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. SPC4 was co-expressed with lubricin by including 1 μg of the SPC4 expression plasmid (20Constam D.B. Robertson E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) during the transfection. Transfected COS-7 cells were maintained in growth medium for 24 h and then switched to 10 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/plate. After 24 h, conditioned medium and cell lysates were harvested, and aliquots were analyzed for the presence of protein by Western blot. To determine whether inhibiting SPC enzymes affected cleavage of lubricin, at 24 h following transfection, cells were switched from growth medium to serum-free medium containing the SPC inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (50 μm) (Bachem). Medium and cell lysate were then harvested 24 h later. Medium was cleared of cell debris. Cell lysate was recovered following the addition of 1 ml of RIPA buffer with cell scraping. Equal aliquots of medium or cell lysate were mixed with 2× sample loading buffer and boiled for 5 min; 20 μl was loaded per lane. Tagged lubricin or lubricin subdomains were detected using either a 1:250 dilution of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a 1:2500 dilution of anti-HA antibody (MMS-101R) (Covance), in antibody buffer for 1 h. After three washes with TBST (TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5), blots were incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in antibody buffer for 1 h and washed three more times with TBST. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL Plus system as described above. Immunoprecipitation of C-terminal Fragments of Lubricin—To immunoprecipitate the C-terminal cleavage product of lubricin, 956 μl of serum-free conditioned medium from COS-7 cells that had been transiently transfected with the Lub-Myc expression construct was mixed with 4 μl of J109C (1:250 dilution), 40 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), 10 μl of Tween 20, for 16 h at 4 °C. Following brief centrifugation, the beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, dissolved in 40 μl of 2× sample loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, briefly vortexed, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature; 20 μl of sample was loaded per lane. Immunodetection of recovered lubricin was performed using the anti-Myc antibody 9E10 as previously described. Antisera Generated against Epitopes within the Amino and Carboxyl Domains of Lubricin Recognize Endogenous and Recombinant Lubricin with High Specificity—We generated two polyclonal antisera against epitopes within human lubricin (Fig. 1). The epitopes were chosen to recognize the N-terminal or C-terminal regions of the protein. The N-terminal antiserum (J108N) was generated against a peptide motif within the second SMB domain, whereas the C-terminal antiserum (J109C) was generated against a peptide motif within the PEX domain. The J108N antiserum could detect a >200-kDa band on SDS-PAGE Western blots, consistent with the size of full-length lubricin, in synovial fluid samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (Fig. 2A and data not shown). In addition to full-length lubricin, multiple smaller polypeptide species (<39 kDa) were also detected by this antiserum in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which probably represent degradation products (Fig. 2A). Importantly, neither full-length lubricin nor any smaller polypeptides were present in synovial fluid samples from several patients with CACP, although equal amounts of synovial fluid protein were evaluated (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that J108N antiserum is specific to lubricin in synovial fluid. Further support for the specificity of the antibody derives from studies using recombinantly expressed protein (Fig. 2B). The J109C antiserum was also tested for its ability to recognize lubricin. Synovial fluid samples from an osteoarthritis patient and from a CACP patient were analyzed by Western blot under reducing conditions (Fig. 3A). Additionally, synovial fluid specimens recovered from healthy cow and pig joints were also evaluated using this antibody (Fig. 3B). In the osteoarthritis sample, the antibody detected full-length protein and also a single 14-kDa species, whereas neither band was detected in the CACP sample (Fig. 3A). The specificity of this antiserum for lubricin was further confirmed using cultured synoviocytes and recombinantly expressed protein (data not shown). Intriguingly, antiserum J109C only detected the 14-kDa fragment in synovial fluid from a healthy pig and cow (Fig. 3B), suggesting that this fragment results from a normal post-translational processing event. However, an alternative explanation for this finding is that J109C cannot detect full-length pig or cow lubricin because their epitopes are obscured when the protein is not cleaved. Absence of Lubricin Synthesis or Secretion Is a Common Mechanism of Mutational Effect for CACP Disease-causing Mutations—Synovial fluid aspirates were available from four patients with disease-causing mutations in PRG4 (Fig. 1). In contrast to synovial fluid recovered from patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, in which lubricin and/or lubricin degradation products were readily detectable by immunoblotting, no immunodetectable lubricin or lubricin fragments were present in the CACP samples (Figs. 2 and 3). This implies that disease-causing frameshift and nonsense mutations commonly affect PRG4 mRNA stability or lead to the production of an unstable, truncated lubricin polypeptide. To distinguish between these two possibilities, lubricin protein was assessed in conditioned media and cell lysates from cultured wild-type and CACP patient synoviocytes with defined mutations (Figs. 1 and 2C). Each of these mutations occurs downstream of the SMB epitope detected by J108N, so that this antiserum should detect truncated forms of lubricin, were they to be expressed. Lubricin was not detected in conditioned medium or cell lysate from either cultured CACP patient synoviocytes, although it was present in conditioned medium and cell lysate from wild-type (i.e. osteoarthritis (OA)) synoviocytes (Fig. 2C). Therefore, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (21Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 307-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) seems to be the most likely mechanism leading to absent lubricin synthesis in patients with nonsense and frameshift mutations that involve exons upstream of the final coding exon. Post-translational Processing of the Lubricin PEX Domain Is Functionally Important—Two siblings with CACP were found to be homozygous for a mutation in the final coding exon of PRG4 (17Marcelino J. Carpten J.D. Suwairi W.M. Gutierrez O.M. Schwartz S. Robbins C. Sood R. Makalowska I. Baxevanis A. Johnstone B. Laxer R.M. Zemel L. Kim C.A. Herd J.K. Ihle J. Williams C. Johnson M. Raman V. Alonso L.G. Brunoni D. Gerstein A. Papadopoulos N. Bahabri S.A. Trent J.M. Warman M.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This mutation creates a premature termination codon 23 nucleotides upstream of the proper termination codon. The effect of this mutation is not predicted to cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay but is instead predicted to produce a polypeptide that lacks the final 8 amino acid residues of the protein. Because synovial fluid and synoviocytes were not available from these siblings, we expressed this mutant protein (p.S1397X) using COS-7 cells. Truncating the final 8 amino acid residues of the protein did not affect the secretion of the protein (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the mutant protein is likely to be present in synovial fluid but be nonfunctional. Because a highly conserved cysteine residue is among the 8 deleted residues, we hypothesized that this mutation alters the tertiary structure of the PEX domain, thereby interfering with its biologic function. The function of the PEX domain in lubricin remains unknown. However, this 8-residue deletion mutation, coupled with the presence of a C-terminal cleavage fragment in healthy bovine and porcine synovial fluid, led us to determine the site of PEX domain cleavage and assess the effect of the cysteine deletion on this process. We expressed a mouse Prg4 construct, to which we added a C-terminal Myc epitope (Lub-Myc). When we expressed this construct in COS-7 cells, we detected a 14-kDa polypeptide following SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 3C). This size is consistent with the polypeptide being the C-terminal fragment previously observed in human, cow, and pig synovial fluid (Fig. 3B). Under nonreducing conditions, this fragment migrated as a >200-kDa polypeptide, suggesting that it is disulfide-linked to a larger polypeptide (Fig. 6B). To confirm the identity of this fragment, we used the J109C antiserum and were able to immunoprecipitate the fragment from conditioned medium (Fig. 3D). Post-translational processing by subtilisin-like proprotein convertases has been observed within the PEX domains of other proteins (14Matsuda A. Itoh Y. Koshikawa N. Akizawa T. Yana I. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36350-36357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Schvartz I. Seger D. Shaltiel S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We tested whether the PEX domain of lubricin was also cleaved by SPCs. Whereas endogenous cleavage of recombinant lubricin occurred in COS-7 cells, the amount of cleavage was increased when SPC4 was co-expressed (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone, a peptide inhibitor of SPCs, reduced cleavage in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4B). Several potential SPC consensus cleavage sites are present within the PEX domain of lubricin. The likely cleavage site that would yield a 14-kDa C-terminal fragment is in an arginine-rich region between amino acid residues 947 and 954 of the mou"

The overall reaction yields hyperbolic plots of rate versus AGT concentration for O6-MeG but linear plots for the O6-BzG reaction, which is ∼100-fold faster. The binding of AGT and DNA (double-stranded 30-mer/36-mer complex) appears to be diffusion-limited.

The fluorescent dC-analog 6-methylpyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2(3H) one deoxyribonucleoside (pyrrolo dC), which pairs with G, was positioned opposite G, O6-MeG, or O6-BzG and used as a probe of the rate of base flipping. A rapid increase of fluorescence (k ∼200 s–1) was observed with O6-MeG and O6-BzG and AGT but not with a Gly mutation at Arg128, which has been implicated in base flipping with crystal structures. Only weak and slower fluorescence changes were observed with G:pyrrolo dC or T:2-aminopurine pairs. These rate estimates were used in a kinetic model in which AGT binds and scans DNA rapidly, flips O6-alkylG residues, transfers the alkyl group in a chemical step that is rate-limiting in the case of O6-MeG but not O6-BzG, and releases the dealkylated DNA. The results explain the overall patterns of rates of alkyl group removal versus AGT concentration and the effects of the mutations, as well as the greater affinity of AGT for DNA with O6-alkylG lesions.

DNA is subject to damage by endogenous and exogenous chemicals, which generate DNA adducts or otherwise altered DNA bases. The DNA repair process is essential to protect genome integrity (1Friedberg E. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D.

AGT also repairs O4-methylthymine, but the rate of this repair is species-specific, and human AGT repairs this adduct very poorly (3Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). AGT represents an important protective mechanism for protecting DNA from environmental alkylating agents but its presence can have some adverse effects. The presence of AGT in tumor cells is a major factor in resistance to certain therapeutic alkylating agents such as temozolomide and 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)nitrososurea. Also, AGT enhances the toxicity of 1,2-dibromoethane and some related bifunctional electrophiles (4Liu L. Hachey D.L. Valadez J.G. Williams K.M. Guengerich F.P. Loktionova N.A. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4250-4259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mechanistic details of how AGT repairs O6-alkylguanine adducts have been of great interest (3Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of an AGT mutant (C145S) bound to an O6-MeG-containing oligonucleotide provided valuable structural insights for the reaction mechanism (5Daniels D.S. Woo T.T. Luu K.X. Noll D.M. Clarke N.D. Pegg A.E. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1-8Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The alkylated guanine must be flipped out of the DNA double helix for the subsequent transfer of the alkyl residue. In the case of another DNA repair enzyme, UDG, this base flipping or damaged base recognition process may depend on both the binding properties of the protein and the intrinsic DNA strand flexibility (6Krosky D.J. Schwarz F.P. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4188-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). AGT is able to repair O6-MeG in any sequence context. Some reports have suggested that AGT is not sequence-dependent in its activity (7Bender K. Federwisch M. Loggen U. Nehls P. Rajewsky M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2087-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but other work shows that is clearly not the case and that some sequences are repaired more efficiently than others (8Dolan M.E.

Escherichia coli AGT (AdaC), which has a smaller substrate binding pocket, prefers an O6-MeG adduct over a bulky O6-BzG adduct (11Dolan M.E. Pegg A.E. Dumenco L.L. Moschel R.C. Gerson S.L. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The larger adduct O6-pyridyloxobutyl G was repaired by human AGT, although not very efficiently, compared with a O6-BzG adduct (12Mijal R.S. Thomson N.M. Fleischer N.L. Pauly G.T. Moschel R.C.

However, the rates of base flipping and any scanning processes are unknown. In this report, we studied the rates of alkyl transfer, dissociation, and base flipping for O6-MeG and O6-BzG adducts in a double-stranded oligonucleotide with AGT. Several mutants involving the site-directed mutations in the AGT active site were examined. The measured kinetic parameters were evaluated in a more complex reaction model, which involves the four steps of DNA-AGT association, base flipping, alkyl transfer, and DNA-AGT dissociation (Scheme 1). The implications of this kinetic model are discussed. Chemicals—UDG, piperidine, and O6-BzG were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All oligonucleotides (Table I) were purchased from Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX) or Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA), except the O6-BzG-containing oligonucleotide, which was synthesized in the Vanderbilt facility using general phosphoramidite technology (Scheme 2) (21Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were purified by either HPLC or denaturing gel electrophoresis before use (21Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the measurement of reaction rates, the 32P-labeled strand contained a U instead of a T to allow for UDG/piperidine cleavage to generate shorter products that could be readily separated and analyzed (Scheme 2).Table IOligonucleotide sequencesFor koff measurement:5′-GCCTCGAGCCAGCCGCAGACGCAGCGAGGA-3′3′-CGGAGCTCGGTCGGCGTCTGCGTCGCTCCTGCGGC-5′aG = dG, O6Me-dG, or O6Bz-dG.For reaction rate measurement:5′-GCCTCGAGCCAGCCGCAGACGCAGCGAGGA-3′3′-CGGAGCTCGGTCGGCGTCTGCGUCGCTCCTGCGGCT-32PbG = dG, O6Me-dG, or O6Bz-dG. 5′For base flipping measurements:5′-GCCTCGAGCCAGCCGCAGACGCAGCGAGGA-3′cC = pyrrolo dC.3′-CGGAGCTCGGTCGGCGTCTGCGUCGCTCCTGCGGCT-5′dG = dG, O6Me-dG, or O6Bz-dG.a G = dG, O6Me-dG, or O6Bz-dG.b G = dG, O6Me-dG, or O6Bz-dG.c C = pyrrolo dC.d G = dG, O6Me-dG, or O6Bz-dG.

E. coli thioredoxin was expressed and purified as described previously (26Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Presteady-state Rapid-quench Measurements of Reaction Rates— Rapid-quench experiments were carried out in a KinTek Quench-Flow Apparatus (Model RQF-3, KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Reactions were started by rapid mixing of AGT (12.5 μl) with DNA substrate (10.9 μl) (Scheme 2). Final concentrations were 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 25 nm DNA, and varying concentrations of AGT proteins. The sample drive syringes contained deionized H2O. The reactions were quenched with 0.3 m HCl or 0.3 m NaOH added from the middle drive syringe, followed by neutralization with 1 m NaOH or 1 m HCl. Because of the acid sensitivity of O6-BzG, 0.3 m NaOH was used as the quenching reagent instead of 0.3 m HCl in these assays. The samples (120 μl) were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and UDG (1 unit), Tris (pH 7.8), and DTT were added to yield final concentrations of the latter two reagents of 50 and 1 mm respectively. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by piperidine treatment (0.2 m piperidine, 95 °C, 30 min, followed by lyophilization for 2 h). The DNA samples were redissolved in a mixture of 50 μl of water and 150 μl of formamide, and 2 μl of the mixture was analyzed by gel electrophoresis (16% polyacrylamide (w/v), 80 watts, 3.0 h). Radioactivity in the resolved bands was quantitated using a phosphorimaging system (Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad). Plots of product versus time were fit to a single exponential equation y = a + b (1 – e–kt), where y is the product concentration, a is the initial value at t0, b is the amplitude, k is the reaction rate, and t is time with the program GraphPad Prism (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). Presteady-state Rapid-quench Measurement of Dissociation Rates— Rapid-quench experiments were carried out in a KinTek Quench-Flow RQF-3 apparatus. Sample syringe A (12.5 μl) included a preincubated solution of AGT protein in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.8) containing 1 mm DTT, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin ml–1, and 32P-labeled target DNA; either 0.05 μm O6-BzG DNA, 0.2 μm O6-MeG DNA, or 1.0 μm unmodified DNA, with AGT to DNA ratios indicated in the tables. Samples from syringe A were mixed with pol T7– from sample syringe B (10.9 μl) containing Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.8), 5% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm DTT, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin ml–1, and 5 mm MgCl2. The concentration of pol T7– was 450 nm in the case of O6-MeG and O6-BzG DNA and was 2 μm in the case of unmodified DNA (plus a 20-fold molar excess of thioredoxin over pol T7– in all cases). After the samples were mixed and incubated for times varying from 0.05 to 30 s at 25 °C, polymerization was initiated by the addition of dNTP (200 μm) and MgCl2 (5 mm) from the central drive syringe, with a constant reaction time of 0.25 s. After the sample was expelled from the rapid quench apparatus into a test tube containing 500 μlof0.3 m EDTA (in 50% formamide, v/v), the reaction was mixed rapidly using a vortex device to stop the reaction. DNA samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (16% polyacrylamide (w/v), 80 watts, 3.0 h) and radioactivity in the resolved bands was quantitated using a Molecular Imager FX phosphorimaging system. Plots of product versus time were fit to a single-exponential equation in GraphPad Prism using the equation y = Df + D0 (1 – e–k(off)t) where y is the concentration of product, Df is the free DNA concentration, D0 is the AGT-bound DNA concentration, koff is the dissociation rate of DNA from AGT, and t is time. Modification of AGT by O6-Bz Guanine—AGTs were incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of O6-Bz guanine (dissolved in CH3OH) in 200 ml of solution, with a final concentration of 100–140 mm AGT (27Pegg A.E. Boosalis M. Samson L. Moschel R.C. Byers T.L. Swenn K. Dolan M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11998-12006Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (1.5% final concentration of CH3OH in reaction). The reaction was gently shaken at room temperature using a model E-36 micromixer (TAITEC Co., Saitama, Japan) for 2 min. Excess O6-Bz guanine was extracted using a Sephadex G-10 filtration column (200 ml) packed in an Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The final AGT concentration was measured by UV absorbance. Steady-state Fluorescence Experiments—Fluorescence assays were done using an OLIS DM45 spectrofluorometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). An excitation wavelength of 360 nm was used in assays measuring pyrrolo dC fluorescence. Emission spectra were recorded over the range of 400–500 nm. The bandpass was 5 nm for both the emission and the excitation slits. Stopped-flow Fluorescence Experiments—Fluorescence assays were done using an Applied Photophysics SX-17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Leatherhead, UK). An excitation wavelength of 370 nm was used in assays monitoring pyrrolo dC fluorescence quenching. Emission was monitored by use of a >400-nm cutoff filter. Data were collected and analyzed using the Applied Photophysics software. Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of equal volumes of primer/template complex (400 nm in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8) with AGT proteins (1.6 μm in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8, containing 2 mm DTT). All reactions were done at 25 °C. Traces are presented as averages of several individual reactions (4–5 reactions), and data were fit to single-exponential and biexponential equations. Kinetic Simulations—Fitting and simulation were done using the program DynaFit (BioKin, Ltd., Pullman, WA) (28Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar), used with a Macintosh G5 computer (Apple Computer, Cuppertino, CA), with x,y files (see Supplementary Data). Measurement of Reaction Rates—Relatively long nucleotide pairs (Table I) were synthesized and used to ensure coverage of the protein active site, and the rates for AGT and some mutants were compared. One issue with these longer substrates was the small difference in mobility between alkylated and the non-alkylated (product) DNA in analytical gel electrophoresis. A dT residue was replaced by a uracil residue in the DNA strand two bases 3′ of the alkylated dG, and (after the reactions were quenched) the DNA samples were treated with UDG/piperidine to generate the 5′-32P-labeled 13-mer fragments, which were readily resolved (Scheme 1 and Fig. 1). The rates of alkyl transfer from O6-MeG and O6-BzG to AGT were measured using rapid quench conditions, because of the rapid reaction rates. O6-MeG oligonucleotides (25 nm) were incubated with varying concentrations of AGT (Fig. 2). Reaction rates (kobs) were estimated by fits to a single-exponential equation, and the kobs values were plotted against AGT concentration to generate the kreaction (kr) and Kd values (Table II). Mutations at Arg128 and Tyr114, two residues implicated from site-directed mutagenesis and crystallography work (5Daniels D.S. Woo T.T. Luu K.X. Noll D.M. Clarke N.D. Pegg A.E. Tainer J.A. Nat.

The repair rates were much higher for the O6-BzG substrate, and the reactions were complete in <200 ms with the range of different AGT concentrations used (Fig. 3A). The kobs versus [AGT] traces produced linear fits for both WT AGT and the mutants (Fig. 3B), and the slope (kcat/[AGT]) was used as the parameter reflecting the overall DNA repair efficiency (Table II). Estimation of AGT-DNA Dissociation Rates Using Presteady-state Rapid-quench Experiments—AGT-DNA dissociation rates were measured using the design shown in Scheme 3. (Attempts to directly observe binding and dissociation rates by fluorescence measurements were unsuccessful.) 32P-labeled DNA was premixed with AGT to form a complex and then rapidly mixed with pol T7–/thioredoxin. After the AGT-DNA complex dissociation, free DNA is trapped by the excess pol T7– to form a complex (Kd ∼15 nm (26Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). With the addition of dNTPs, the pol T7– reactions proceeded for 0.25 s before quenching and, thus, the new pol T7–-DNA complexes are detected as one-base incorporation products, monitored by gel electrophoresis. The pol T7–-DNA complex only accounts for a portion of the total DNA; the amplitude does not affect the estimates of the dissociation rates. Dissociation rates for different AGT-DNA combinations are listed in Tables III and IV, based on single exponential fits of the data (Fig. 4). The rates of dissociation with the O6-alkyl-modified DNA could not be measured with catalytically active AGT, and therefore either the C145A and C145S mutants (Table III) or the alkylated AGT (Table IV) was used. The results with unmodified DNA (Table IV) indicate that mutation or alkylation of Cys145 did not alter the rates of dissociation. In general, all AGTs quickly dissociate from unmodified DNAs (koff = 15–39 s–1) but dissociate more slowly from the alkylated DNAs (0.6–1.4 s–1). The koff rates were measured for two benzylated AGTs, the WT, and the R128L mutant (47 s–1). 2After the benzylation treatment, some modified AGT was lost during Sephadex G-10 column filtration because of inherent instability (29Guengerich F.P. Fang Q. Liu L. Hachey D.L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10965-10970Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Rasimas J.J. Dalessio P.A. Ropson I.J. Pegg A.E. Fried M.G. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Freshly benzylated AGTs were used in these assays. Benzylation of the C145 residue of AGT is readily done with O6-Bz guanine (27Pegg A.E. Boosalis M. Samson L. Moschel R.C. Byers T.L. Swenn K. Dolan M.E.

If the modified dG is flipped out, the fluorescence signal of pyrrolo dC should increase, because the quenching effect from base pairing is diminished, as in the case of 2-aminopurine work done with UDG (31Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 32Krosky D.J. Song F. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5949-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). AGT-C145A, mutant totally devoid of activity, was added to a pyrrolo dC DNA duplex, and the fluorescence changes were recorded (using buffer for background subtraction) (Fig. 5). The fluorescence change because of the AGT itself was non-detectable. With O6-BzG-containing DNA, the fluorescence signal was increased >2-fold upon the addition of AGT. The amplitude of the fluorescence change was smaller for the O6-MeG adducts, in part because of the higher fluorescence background from the DNA alone. Unmodified DNA showed a weak fluorescence change, probably due in part to the looser binding of the unmodified guanine by AGTs (Table IV). These titration experiments were also done with the AGT-C145S mutant, which generated similar results (not shown).Fig. 5Fluorescence changes of duplex DNA (pyrrolo dC) upon addition of AGT-C145A.

The lower amplitude and slower flipping rate for the unmodified DNA reflects the weak interactions of AGT with non-alkylated DNA. The base pairing between pyrrolo dC and an unmodified G is stronger than with an O6-alkylG, and AGT should be less likely to flip the G than an O6-alkyl G, based on work with UDG mechanisms (6Krosky D.J. Schwarz F.P. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4188-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Unmodified G may not fit the AGT binding pocket as well as G O6-alkyl if the guanine residue is flipped out, although this possibility does not find support in the analysis of the crystal structure (5Daniels D.S. Woo T.T. Luu K.X. Noll D.M. Clarke N.D. Pegg A.E. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1-8Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Overall, the low fluorescence amplitude and slow rate of change suggest only weak and nonspecific interactions between the unmodified DNA and the AGT. The reactions with O6-BzG substrates were further investigated using AGT mutants (Fig. 6B). Arg128 is a key residue thought to be involved in base flipping (5Daniels D.S. Woo T.T. Luu K.X. Noll D.M. Clarke N.D. Pegg A.E. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1-8Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and intrudes the DNA duplex, based on the x-ray crystal structures. With WT AGT, two reaction phases were observed, with the faster having a rate of 240 s–1. There was also a slow phase (14 s–1), which may be attributed to the DNA-AGT dissociation step (Table IV). One interpretation of this result is that pyrrolo dC can pair with the repaired G only after the total release by the AGT. Consistently, when Arg128 was replaced by Gly to abolish the base flipping “arm” (5Daniels D.S. Woo T.T. Luu K.X. Noll D.M. Clarke N.D. Pegg A.E. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2076747420,"Pharmacologic approaches to activate K<sup>+</sup> channels represent an emerging strategy to regulate membrane excitability. Here we report the identification and characterization of a lipid soluble toxin, mallotoxin (rottlerin), which potently activates the large conductance voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel (BK) expressed in a heterologous expression system and human vascular smooth muscle cells, shifting the conductance/voltage relationship by >100 mV. Probing the mechanism of action, we discover that the BK channel can be activated in the absence of divalent cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>), suggesting that the mallotoxin mechanism of action involves the voltage-dependent gating of the channel. Mallotoxin-activated channels remain incrementally sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and β subunits. In comparison to other small hydrophobic poisons, anesthetic agents, and protein toxins that inhibit ion channel activity, mallotoxin potently activates channel activity. In certain respects, mallotoxin acts as a BK channel β1 subunit mimetic, preserving BK channel Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity yet adjusting the set-point for BK channel activation to a more hyperpolarized membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W2159394259,"The blind subterranean mole rat superspecies Spalax ehrenbergi has evolved adaptations that allow it to survive and carry out intensive activities in its highly hypoxic underground sealed burrows. A key component of this adaptation is a higher capillary density in some Spalax tissues, primarily in muscles used in digging and in other energetic activities, resulting in a shorter diffusion distance for oxygen. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic factor that is critical for angiogenesis during development and is found in response to tissue ischemia. We demonstrate here that due to physiological differences, the Spalax muscle regulatory mechanism for VEGF is different than in Rattus muscle. In vivo, the constitutive level of the VEGF mRNA and the mRNA levels of its transcriptional regulator HIF-1alpha and its mRNA stabilizer HuR are significantly higher in Spalax muscle than in Rattus muscle. Furthermore, as opposed to Rattus, the mRNA levels of HIF-1alpha, HuR, VEGF, as well as that of LDH-A, the enzyme that catalyzes the production of lactate, an accepted marker of anaerobic metabolism, are not increased in Spalax after hypoxia. However, ex vivo, when oxygenation by blood vessels is no longer relevant, the expression pattern of all these genes is similar in the two rodents under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our studies provide evidence that the highly vascularized muscle in Spalax, the most energy consuming tissue during digging, is resistant to the effects of oxygen deprivation. The significance of these results with respect to ischemic vascular disease is abundantly clear."
https://openalex.org/W1970989418,"The dietary cis-polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid, stimulates adhesion of metastatic human breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-435) to the extracellular matrix, but the molecular mechanisms by which fatty acids modify the behavior of these cells are unclear. Exposure to arachidonic acid activates multiple signaling pathways. Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) is required for increased cell adhesion to type IV collagen, and this activation is sensitive to inhibitors of lipoxygenases, suggesting a requirement for arachidonic acid metabolism. The goals of the current study were to identify the one or more key metabolites of arachidonic acid that are responsible for activation of p38 MAPK and to elucidate the upstream kinases that lead to p38 MAPK activation. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis revealed that MDA-MB-435 cells metabolize exogenous arachidonic acid predominantly to 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE). Immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific to 15(S)-lipoxygenase-1 (LOX-1) and 15(S)-lipoxygenase-2 (LOX-2) demonstrated the expression of 15-LOX-2, but not 15-LOX-1, in these tumor cells. A LOX inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, attenuated production of 15(S)-HETE and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK following exposure to arachidonic acid. In contrast, overexpression of LOX-2 sensitized the cells to the addition of arachidonic acid, leading to increased activation of p38 MAPK. Addition of exogenous 15(S)-HETE to MDA-MB-435 cells stimulated cell adhesion to type IV collagen and activated the p38 MAPK pathway, including the upstream kinases transforming growth factor-β1-activated protein kinase-1 (TAK1) and MAPK kinase 6. Transfection of these cells with a dominant negative form of TAK1 blocked arachidonic acid-stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that 15(S)-LOX-2 generation of 15(S)-HETE activates specific growth factor receptor-related signaling pathways, thereby initiating signal transduction events leading to increased cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. The dietary cis-polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid, stimulates adhesion of metastatic human breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-435) to the extracellular matrix, but the molecular mechanisms by which fatty acids modify the behavior of these cells are unclear. Exposure to arachidonic acid activates multiple signaling pathways. Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) is required for increased cell adhesion to type IV collagen, and this activation is sensitive to inhibitors of lipoxygenases, suggesting a requirement for arachidonic acid metabolism. The goals of the current study were to identify the one or more key metabolites of arachidonic acid that are responsible for activation of p38 MAPK and to elucidate the upstream kinases that lead to p38 MAPK activation. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis revealed that MDA-MB-435 cells metabolize exogenous arachidonic acid predominantly to 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE). Immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific to 15(S)-lipoxygenase-1 (LOX-1) and 15(S)-lipoxygenase-2 (LOX-2) demonstrated the expression of 15-LOX-2, but not 15-LOX-1, in these tumor cells. A LOX inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, attenuated production of 15(S)-HETE and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK following exposure to arachidonic acid. In contrast, overexpression of LOX-2 sensitized the cells to the addition of arachidonic acid, leading to increased activation of p38 MAPK. Addition of exogenous 15(S)-HETE to MDA-MB-435 cells stimulated cell adhesion to type IV collagen and activated the p38 MAPK pathway, including the upstream kinases transforming growth factor-β1-activated protein kinase-1 (TAK1) and MAPK kinase 6. Transfection of these cells with a dominant negative form of TAK1 blocked arachidonic acid-stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that 15(S)-LOX-2 generation of 15(S)-HETE activates specific growth factor receptor-related signaling pathways, thereby initiating signal transduction events leading to increased cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. The cis-polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid and its many metabolites are important mediators of cell signaling with roles in inflammation, platelet aggregation, tissue development, and carcinogenesis (1Piomelli D.

The cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids have been implicated in a number of in vivo and in vitro rodent studies that link fat intake and cellular fatty acid levels with carcinogenesis, tumor development, and metastasis (6Rose D.P.

However, the specific pathways by which arachidonic acid and its metabolites alter the development and behavior of certain cancers are unclear (9Monjazeb A.M. Clay C.E. High K.P. Chilton F.H.

Lipoxygenases (LOXs) 1The abbreviations used are: LOX, lipoxygenase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TAK, transforming growth factor β1-activated kinase; MKK, MAPK kinase; HETE, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; MKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; NDGA, norhydroguaiaretic acid; MEM, minimal essential medium; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography. are a class of fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes that are responsible for numerous cell responses to cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids. These enzymes convert arachidonic acid to hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which is further metabolized to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE). 12(S)-Lipoxygenase has been identified in platelets, leukocytes, and epidermis of numerous species and converts arachidonic acid predominantly to 12(S)-HETE (11Fan X.T. Huang X.P. Da Silva C. Castagna M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); leukocyte 12(S)-LOX additionally produces 15(S)-HETE (12Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). 15(S)-LOX is thought to play important roles in several physiological processes, including cell differentiation, inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and carcinogenesis (13Kuhn H. Walther M. Kuban R.J. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 263-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). 15(S)-LOX-1 has wide tissue distribution and preferentially metabolizes linoleic acid to 13(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13Kuhn H. Walther M. Kuban R.J. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 263-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid is a less-preferred 15(S)-LOX-1 substrate from which 15(S)-HETE and 12(S)-HETE are produced (14Brash A.R.

Chem. 1982; 257: 6050-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 15(S)-LOX-2, on the other hand, has a more limited tissue distribution (prostate, lung, skin, and cornea) and exclusively metabolizes arachidonic acid to 15(S)-HETE (14Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 16Kilty I. Logan A. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, these two isozymes display important functional differences in their metabolism of arachidonic acid. The regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion plays a key role in the migratory and invasive potential of tumor cells (17Cavallaro U. Christofori G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1552: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The fate of these cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions depends largely on the cellular profile of adhesion molecules and matrix metalloproteases and on the signaling mechanisms that regulate adhesive behavior and cellular responses to environmental stimuli (18Chambers A.R. Groom A.C. MacDonald I.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar, 19Engers R. Gabbert H.E. J. Cancer Res. Clin.

Thus, elucidating the effects of environmental components, such as fatty acids, on tumor cell adhesion is important for the understanding of metastasis. Our laboratory has used the metastatic human breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB-435, to examine the cell-matrix adhesion-related effects of fatty acids on metastatic tumor cells. We first demonstrated that exogenous arachidonic acid rapidly stimulates an increase in the adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells to the prevalent basement membrane protein, type IV collagen, in vitro (21Palmantier R. Roberts J.D. Glasgow W.C. Eling T. Olden K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2206-2212PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of LOX activity blocks the ability of arachidonic acid to promote cell adhesion. These results suggested that arachidonic acid or its metabolites could affect metastasis through alteration of the adhesive properties of tumor cells and encouraged us to investigate the lipid-induced signaling pathways involved in this process. Our investigations showed that arachidonic acid activates both p38 MAPK and protein kinase C isozymes, leading to enhanced cell adhesion (22Palmantier R. George M.D. Akiyama S.K. Wolber F.M. Olden K. Roberts J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2445-2452PubMed Google Scholar, 23Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Roberts J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11284-11290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This work demonstrated that both pathways are required for the fatty acid-induced adhesion. Our model has been previously described in detail (24Kennett S.B. Roberts J.D. Olden K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3300-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have not yet determined the metabolites generated by the lipoxygenases, nor the isoforms of the LOX involved in this process. Nor is it clear which upstream kinases are responsible for the activation of the p38 MAPK in this system. In this study, we examined how MDA-MB-435 human carcinoma cells metabolize arachidonic acid and how the resulting lipid signals lead to activation of p38 MAPK. We show for the first time the presence of 15(S)-LOX-2 in breast carcinoma cells and demonstrate the involvement of upstream kinases TAK1 and MKK6 in the activation of p38 MAPK by the arachidonic acid metabolite, 15(S)-HETE.

Cell Culture—MDA-MB-435 cells were obtained from Dr. Janet Price (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with MEM vitamin solution, sodium pyruvate, l-glutamine, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. For most experiments, cells were harvested by incubation with Versene and resuspended in serum-free MEM. HPLC Analysis of Arachidonic Acid Metabolites—MDA-MB-435 cells suspended in serum-free MEM (3.5 × 105 cells/ml) were equilibrated at 37 °C and treated with [3H]arachidonic acid (15 μCi) plus unlabeled arachidonic acid (30 μm), A23187 (5 μm), or ethanol vehicle. Some groups were pretreated with NDGA (10 μm) for 15 min prior to addition of the radiolabel. At 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after arachidonic acid exposure, an equal volume of methanol was added to quench enzymatic reactions. Radiolabeled fatty acids were isolated from the incubation mixture by a C18-PrepSep solid-phase extraction column (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) after acidification to pH 3.5 with acetic acid. The column was washed with acidified water, and the metabolites were eluted with methanol, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted with HPLC solvent. Reverse phase-HPLC analysis was conducted with an Ultrasphere ODS column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Beckman) equipped with a Waters model 6000A pump and a Waters WISP 710B automatic injector. The mobile phase consisted of a methanol/water/acetic acid mixture (70/30/0.01, v/v/v) with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Eluted radioactivity was monitored with a Flo-One Beta detector using Ecolume (ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) as the liquid scintillate. Cell Adhesion Assay—MDA-MB-435 cells suspended in serum-free MEM (3.5 × 105 cells/ml) were equilibrated at 37 °C and exposed to fatty acids, inhibitors, or ethanol vehicle, transferred in triplicate to 48-well plates coated with either heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (negative control), type IV collagen, or poly-d-lysine (positive control) and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were washed away; adherent cells were fixed in 6% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, washed, and quantified spectrophotometrically after staining with crystal violet. Cell adhesion to type IV collagen was calculated as a percentage of adhesion to poly-d-lysine after subtracting nonspecific cell adhesion in bovine serum albumin-coated wells. Immunoblotting—MDA-MB-435 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 6 mm sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, with 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors: aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) for 30 min on ice. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation and assayed for protein content. Equal protein amounts were boiled in LDS sample buffer with 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blocking and antibody incubations were carried out at recommended dilutions in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin or 5% (w/v) nonfat milk. Primary antibody complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, SuperSignal horseradish peroxidase substrate, and exposure to Hyperfilm. For detection of phosphorylated proteins, blots were probed and analyzed initially with antibodies specific to phosphorylated proteins, then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in stripping buffer (tris-buffered saline, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS) to remove activation-specific antibodies, blocked in 5% nonfat milk, and reprobed with non-activation specific antibodies. Immunoblots were digitized and analyzed using Scion Image analysis software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Uptake of Radiolabeled Fatty Acids—MDA-MB-435 cells were grown as described and resuspended in serum-free MEM at 3.5 × 105 cells/ml. [3H]arachidonic acid (15 μCi) or [3H]15(S)-HETE (15 μCi) was added to 5 ml of cells, and the mixture was allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 45 min. Cells were centrifuged and washed with media twice. Aliquots of each fraction (media, wash, and cells) were transferred to liquid scintillation vials containing scintillation fluid, vortexed, and analyzed for radioactive content in a Beckman LS 6000LL liquid scintillation counter. Radioimmunoprecipitation and Autoradiography—MDA-MB-435 cells were suspended in serum-free MEM (3.5 × 105 cells/ml), equilibrated at 37 °C, incubated for 30 min with [32P]orthophosphate (2.0 mCi) and treated with 15(S)-HETE (0, 10, or 20 μm), arachidonic acid (30 μm), or transforming growth factor-β1 (0.1 ng/ml) for 10 min. Cells were centrifuged, washed, and lysed in lysis buffer as stated previously. Lysates were pre-cleared with protein A-agarose beads and assayed for total protein. Equal amounts of protein were added to overnight reactions with 4 μg of TAK1 polyclonal antibody. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose beads, washed, boiled in LDS sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for autoradiography. Bands corresponding to phosphorylated TAK1 were digitized and quantitated using Scion Image analysis software. The amount of 32P incorporated into TAK1 was such that short exposures of TAK1-containing nitrocellulose membranes to Hyperfilm (up to 24 h) did not produce visible bands. Therefore, we performed immunoblot analysis to detect total TAK1 on the same membranes using rabbit anti-TAK1 and donkey anti-rabbit IgG and exposures of <1 h. Transient Transfections—MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected with pFLAG-TAK1K63W (2 μg/60-mm dish) using FuGENE per the manufacturer's instructions. After 12 h, cells were treated and lysed as stated previously. Transfections with the pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-LOX2 were also done with FuGENE, but the cells were allowed to express the LOX-2 for 48 h prior to treatment with arachidonic acid. Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze data from three to five separate experiments. Significant differences were determined with a p value set at <0.05. HPLC Analysis of Lipoxygenase Metabolites of Arachidonic Acid in MDA-MB-435 Cells—Arachidonic acid stimulates a number of changes in the behavior of MDA-MB-435 human breast tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner (22Palmantier R. George M.D. Akiyama S.K. Wolber F.M. Olden K. Roberts J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2445-2452PubMed Google Scholar, 23Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Roberts J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11284-11290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but the metabolite responsible for these effects has not yet been identified. Thus, we identified lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid in cells treated with a stimulatory dose of arachidonic acid (30 μm) plus [3H]arachidonic acid (15 μCi). Reverse-phase HPLC revealed a single major peak of radiolabeled material in cell extracts prepared 5, 10, and 15 min after arachidonic acid exposure (Fig. 1A). The same peak was evident following exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187 (5 μm), which also stimulates arachidonic acid release and metabolism in these cells. The radiolabeled material co-eluted with standard 15(S)-HETE, which is an arachidonic acid metabolite produced by 15(S)-LOX (data not shown). 15(S)-HETE production following arachidonic acid exposure was abolished by the LOX inhibitor NDGA in a dose-dependent manner, providing evidence that 15(S)-HETE production in MDA-MB-435 cells results from LOX-mediated metabolism of arachidonic acid (Fig. 1B and Table I).Table IInhibition of 15(S)-HETE production by NDGA in MDA-MB-435 cellsNDGA concentration15-(S)-HETE peak integrationInhibitionμmcounts / min%0155,26000.1154,900<10.5154,900<11.0118,000255.048,1307010.01,450>99 Open table in a new tab Under the conditions of our experiments, there are two possible pathways by which arachidonic acid may become accessible to cellular lipoxygenases: the exogenously added arachidonic acid may be metabolized directly as it is taken up, or it may first be incorporated into membrane phospholipids and consequently released by phospholipase activity. To determine whether phospholipase-dependent release of arachidonic acid is critical for the generation of this 15-(S)-HETE, we pretreated cells with the phospholipase A2 inhibitor arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone and measured the production of LOX metabolites following addition of exogenous [3H]arachidonic acid. Arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone did not alter the production of [3H]15(S)-HETE, nor did it block arachidonic acid-stimulated adhesion to type IV collagen (data not shown), suggesting that the arachidonic acid metabolized under these conditions was taken up from the exogenous pool and not released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Characterization of 15-Lipoxygenase Enzymes in MDA-MB-435 Cells—Two 15-LOX isoforms have been identified in human cells to date (13Kuhn H. Walther M. Kuban R.J. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 263-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To identify the 15-lipoxygenase isoform responsible for 15(S)-HETE production in MDA-MB-435 cells following arachidonic acid exposure, cell extracts from appropriate reference tissues and from MDA-MB-435 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with specific antibodies directed against 15-LOX-1 or 15-LOX-2. Chemiluminescent detection of immune complexes showed that MDA-MB-435 cells did not express 15-LOX-1 at detectable levels as compared with an extract of normal human tracheobronchial epithelial cells, an abundant source of 15-LOX-1 (Fig. 2A). In comparison, MDA-MB-435 cells express a 78-kDa protein corresponding to 15-LOX-2 (Fig. 2B). This conclusion was supported by immunodetection of a protein of similar size in an extract of normal human prostate epithelium, the tissue from which 15-LOX-2 was originally cloned (14Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These results suggest that 15-LOX-2 is the isozyme responsible for the metabolism of arachidonic acid to 15(S)-HETE in MDA-MB-435 cells. Cell Adhesion following Addition of Exogenous 15(S)-HETE—To verify the role of 15(S)-HETE as the key lipid mediator of the observed effects of arachidonic acid, we added 15(S)-HETE directly to MDA-MB-435 cell suspensions and measured its effect on cell adhesion to type IV collagen. 15(S)-HETE stimulated a dose-dependent increase in MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion to type IV collagen, with the highest dose of 15(S)-HETE (20 μm) producing a 3-fold increase in cell adhesion to type IV collagen compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3). 15(R)-HETE did not increase cell adhesion to type IV collagen (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that the 15(S)-LOX metabolism of arachidonic acid is required to stimulate adhesion. The stimulation of cell adhesion by exogenous 15(S)-HETE was slightly less than that observed with exogenous arachidonic acid (Fig. 3). One possibility for this difference is that the polarity of 15(S)-HETE hinders its uptake into MDA-MB-435 cells compared with the uptake of arachidonic acid. To address this issue, we measured the uptake of exogenous [3H]15(S)-HETE and exogenous [3H]arachidonic acid by MDA-MB-435 cells in suspension. Cells exposed to [3H]arachidonic acid for 2 min incorporated >60% of the available lipid; whereas <5% of [3H]15(S)-HETE became cell-associated (Fig. 4A). When the incubation time was extended to 45 min as in the adhesion assay (Fig. 3), >33% of the available 15(S)-HETE was incorporated into the cells (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that the diminished effect of exogenous 15(S)-HETE on cell adhesion to type IV collagen is due to decreased intracellular uptake of 15(S)-HETE compared with arachidonic acid. p38 MAPK Activation following Lipoxygenase Inhibition— Our previous studies have shown that arachidonic acid treatment leads to activation of p38 MAPK and several proteins downstream of this kinase (22Palmantier R. George M.D. Akiyama S.K. Wolber F.M. Olden K. Roberts J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2445-2452PubMed Google Scholar, 23Paine E. Palmantier R. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Roberts J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11284-11290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This work showed that there was a dose response of p38 activation to arachidonic acid and that the inhibition of p38 activation completely blocked cell adhesion to collagen IV. To determine whether lipoxygenase metabolism is critical for the arachidonic acid-stimulated activation of p38 MAPK, immunoblot analysis was performed on extracts from MDA-MB-435 cell pretreated with NDGA then exposed to arachidonic acid. The amount of p38 MAPK activated after stimulation with arachidonic acid (Fig. 5, upper panels) was normalized to total p38 MAPK expression (Fig. 5, lower panels). At 1 and 5 min post treatment, arachidonic acid stimulated a 4- and 7-fold increase, respectively, in the activation of p38 MAPK in MDA-MB-435 cells compared with vehicle-treated cells. In the presence of NDGA, however, p38 MAPK activation by arachidonic acid at 1 and 5 min was inhibited by 65 and 55%, respectively, suggesting that lipoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid is required for the activation of p38 MAPK. The lipoxygenase inhibitor, NDGA, is not specific for a single isoform of the enzyme. Thus, we used a vector that carries the 15(S)-LOX-2 gene to test whether increased expression of this isoform in the MDA-MB-435 cells would lead to increased activation of the p38 MAPK pathway following addition of arachidonic acid. Cells that were transfected with this vector expressed high levels of the 15(S)-LOX-2, as shown by immunoblots of cell extracts (Fig. 6). (Although not visible in this figure, the 15(S)-LOX-2 protein was detectable in untransfected cells upon longer exposures (data not shown).) Upon addition of arachidonic acid, these cells displayed a significantly higher level of p38 MAPK activation than in cells carrying the empty vector control. A quantitative analysis by densitometry indicated that the cells overexpressing the 15(S)-LOX-2 showed at least twice as much p38 MAPK activation when normalized to the amount of total p38 in the cells. We also observed increased activation of p38 at lower concentrations of arachidonic acid (10 μm) in the 15(S)-LOX-2-overexpressing cells (data not shown), indicating that these cells are more sensitive to the fatty acid. Activation of the p38 MAPK Pathway following 15(S)-HETE Exposure—We next sought to determine the effect of exogenous 15(S)-HETE on the activation of p38 MAPK and its upstream activators in MDA-MB-435 cells. Multiple kinases present in MDA-MB-435 cells, including MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6, are capable of activating p38 MAPK (26Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 27Alonso G. Ambrosino C. Jones M. Nebreda A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40641-40648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We measured kinase activation at 45 min to allow significant uptake of 15(S)-HETE into the cells. Immunoblots of active and total p38 MAPK, MKK6, and MKK3 revealed that 15(S)-HETE stimulated a dose-dependent activation of p38 MAPK that was similar to the stimulation of p38 MAPK by arachidonic acid (Fig. 7A). Neither 15(S)-HETE nor arachidonic acid activated the MAPK kinase MKK3 (Fig. 7B); furthermore, treatment with doses (30 μm) of arachidonic acid that activated p38 did not activate MKK4 (data not shown). However, 15(S)-HETE stimulated a dose-dependent increase in the activation of MKK6 (Fig. 7B) similar to that produced by arachidonic acid, suggesting that MKK6 is activated in response to arachidonic acid exposure and metabolism to 15(S)-HETE.

The testis-specific kinesin KIF17b was shown to directly regulate cAMP-response element modulator (CREM)-dependent transcription by determining the subcellular localization of the activator of CREM in testis (ACT), the testis-specific coactivator of CREM in postmeiotic male germ cells. CREM is a crucial transcriptional regulator of many important genes required for spermatid maturation, as demonstrated by the complete block of sperm development at the first steps of spermiogenesis in crem-null mice. To better understand the complex regulation of postmeiotic germ cell differentiation, we further characterized the ACT-KIF17b interaction, the function of KIF17b, and the signaling pathways governing its action. In this study, we demonstrated that the abilities of KIF17b to shuttle between the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartments and to transport ACT are neither dependent on its motor domain nor on microtubules, thus revealing a novel microtubule-independent function for kinesins. We also showed that the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A mediates the phosphorylation of KIF17b, and this modification is important for its subcellular localization. These results indicate that cyclic AMP signaling controls CREM-mediated transcription in male germ cells through modification of KIF17b function.

The complex differentiation of spermatogenic stem cells into mature sperm is governed by a highly specialized and strictly controlled program of gene expression. In spermatogonia and spermatocytes, the genes required for accurate mitotic and meiotic functions, respectively, are transcribed. Transcription ceases during the homologous chromosome pairing and meiotic recombination, but is again activated in postmeiotic germ cells. In the course of the differentiation of haploid spermatids into mature sperm, the genes required for development of acrosome, tail formation, removal of cytoplasm, and compaction of DNA are expressed (1Oakberg E.F.

Upon compaction of chromatin by replacement of histones with transition proteins and protamines, the transcriptional activity ceases, and the mature sperm is transcriptionally inactive (4Sassone-Corsi P.

Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), indicating the crucial role of CREM in postmeiotic germ cell differentiation. CREM-dependent transcription in testis is regulated by the testis-specific LIM-only protein activator of CREM in testis (ACT) that functions as a coactivator for CREM (11Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The phenotype of act-null mice indicates that ACT is involved in the control of a specific subset of CREM target genes (12Kotaja N. De Cesare D. Macho B. Monaco L. Brancorsini S. Goossens E. Tournaye H. Gansmuller A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10620-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The study of act-null mice demonstrated that ACT is required for the normal development of sperm head and tail. ACT is expressed at specific stages of germ cell development, the highest level of expression occurring in postmeiotic haploid round spermatids (11Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of ACT is regulated by a kinesin motor protein, KIF17b, which colocalizes with ACT in haploid spermatids and mediates the transport of ACT from the nucleus to the cytoplasm at specific stages of spermatid maturation (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The expression of ACT in testis remarkably overlaps with CREM expression, and relocalization of ACT to the cytoplasm by the action of KIF17b correlates with the termination of transcription of the CREM-regulated genes (11Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Spermatogenesis is controlled by a complex network of endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine signals. In response to the hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone, the pituitary gland secretes two hormones, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), that are involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis. Luteinizing hormone regulates the testosterone secretion by somatic Leydig cells located in the interstitium between seminiferous tubules. FSH acts on Sertoli cells, the only somatic cells inside the seminiferous tubule, by stimulating signaling, gene expression, and secretion of peptides and other signaling molecules (14Griswold M.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Germ cells lack the receptors for pituitary hormones and are embedded in cytoplasmic pockets of Sertoli cells, which control spermatogenesis through strict paracrine regulation. To respond to external stimuli, germ cells utilize various transduction pathways that together form a complex signaling network governing germ cell development. The signaling mechanisms transferring information between Sertoli cells and germ cells remain so far largely unknown (15Weinbauer G.F. Wessels J. Andrologia. 1999; 31: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). KIF17b is shuttling between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and is able to transport ACT from the nucleus to the cytoplasm at a specific stage of spermatid differentiation (stage VIII/IX). The signals in haploid germ cells that induce KIF17b to relocate with ACT to the cytoplasm after the onset of spermatid elongation are yet unknown. In this study, we have clarified the function of KIF17b and the regulation of CREM-dependent transcription by studying the mechanisms that modulate KIF17b localization. Strikingly, movement of KIF17b between nucleus and cytoplasm and its ability to transport ACT were shown to be independent of microtubules and the motor domain of the kinesin. These results indicate a novel, microtubule-independent mechanism for the function of kinesins. We also demonstrated that KIF17b movement is modulated by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) dependent on phosphorylation, suggesting a role of cyclic AMP signaling in the regulation of CREM-dependent transcription in male germ cells. Plasmid Construction—pGAD-ACT, pSG5-ACT, and pCS2-MTK-ACT, containing the N-terminal Myc tag, have been described previously (11Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). pSG5-KIF17b has been described previously (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). KIF17b fragments were generated by PCR using the primers containing specific restriction sites. They were cloned either in pGBT9 yeast expression vector (Clontech), containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (EcoRI and SalI), or in pTL1 vector, which is the pSG5 vector with a modified multiple cloning site (EcoRI and HindIII). KIF17b fragments were also transferred from pTL1 vector to pCS2-MTK vector (16Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), containing the N-terminal Myc tag, using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. The full-length Myc-tagged KIF17b was generated by digesting the N terminus of KIF17b from the pSG5 vector by EcoRI and BstEII (there is an internal BstEII site in the KIF17b sequence) and ligating it to the pCS2-MTK-KIF17b-C terminus digested with the same enzyme. The serine residues within the putative PKA consensus sites were mutated to alanines using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pCS2-MTK-KIF17b as a template. Yeast Interaction Assay—Yeast transformation and the β-galactosidase assays were performed in yeast strain Y190, as described in the Clontech Matchmaker two-hybrid system protocol. Yeast cells were cotransformed with the pGBT-KIF17b constructs pGAD-ACT and β-galactosidase reporter. β-Galactosidase activities were calculated in Miller units. The results reported are the means of three independent experiments. Immunofluorescence and Treatments—COS-1 cells grown on 3-cm culture dishes were transfected by FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) with the indicated plasmid, the total amount of DNA being 1 μg. 32 h after transfection, the cells were treated for either 6 h with 25 μm colchicine (Sigma) or 1 h with signaling pathway inhibitors (10 μm H-89, 20 μm PD98059, 20 μm SB203580, 5 μm Ro-31-8220, 200 μm SQ22536, or 10 ng/ml Toxin B (Calbiochem)). After the treatments, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The immunofluorescence analysis was performed using polyclonal K3638 anti-KIF17 antibody (1:500) (Sigma), monoclonal anti-ACT antibody (1:1000) (11Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), affinity-purified polyclonal anti-ACT antibody (1:1000), monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10 antibody (1:1000), or monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (1:1000) (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). AlexaFluor goat anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). In Vivo Phosphorylation—COS-1 cells grown on 6-cm culture dishes were transfected with 2 μg of Myc-tagged KIF17b constructs. 24 h later, the medium was changed, and the cells were grown in the phosphate-deprived medium overnight. Next morning, the cells were incubated with 32P-labeled orthophosphate (250 μCi/ml, MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) for 4 h in the absence or presence of the inhibitors. Cells were lysed in the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 100 μm NaVO3, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture. After clearing of the lysate, immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-Myc 9E10 antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), the beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated proteins were released in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were run into a polyacrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie Blue stain to confirm equal amounts of protein in each lane, and phosphorylation of proteins was detected by autoradiography. The rest of the samples were run into a polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with anti-Myc 9E10 antibody to confirm equal loading of KIF17b in each lane. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used as a secondary antibody. Immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). In Vitro Phosphorylation—Overexpressed Myc-tagged KIF17b was immunoprecipitated from COS-1 cells using the anti-Myc 9E10 antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro phosphorylation was performed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm cold ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.05 units/μl catalytic subunit of PKA (Sigma) in a volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 20 min. In some cases, mouse testis protein extract was used instead of PKA. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were run into a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue dye to confirm equal loading of PKA and substrates. The gel was dried and autoradiography was performed to detect phosphorylation. A small part of the sample was run into an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with anti-Myc 9E10 antibody to confirm equal amounts of KIF17b in each lane. Preparation of Testis Extracts—To prepare testis extracts, the testes were decapsulated, and the seminiferous tubules were homogenized in a buffer containing 170 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1:1000 protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 revolutions/min for 15 min. The protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent and adjusted to 5 μg/μl. The Integrity of LIM Domains of ACT Is Required for the Interaction with KIF17b—KIF17b was originally found as an interaction partner of ACT in a yeast two-hybrid screening using full-length ACT as a bait (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have performed deletion analyses and yeast two-hybrid interaction assays to characterize the regions of ACT and KIF17b involved in the interaction. ACT is a LIM-only protein containing four and a half LIM domains, each consisting of the two sequential zinc fingers (11Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of ACT demonstrated that none of the LIM domains alone mediates the interaction with KIF17b, but it is rather the integrity in the organization of the domains that is required for the association (Fig. 1A). Deletion of the half-LIM domain at the N terminus of ACT or the first full LIM domain reduced the interaction to 40 or 70%, respectively. All other deletions disrupted the interaction almost completely. These results indicated that the general three-dimensional ACT structure, rather than a specific domain, was responsible for the interaction with KIF17b. The Central Region of KIF17b Interacts with ACT—KIF17b has an N-terminal motor domain that is very well conserved between all kinesin family members (18Woehlke G. Schliwa M. Nature. 2000; 1: 50-58Google Scholar). Located in the C terminus is a highly variable domain that confers a cargo-binding function to many kinesins (19Kamal A. Goldstein L.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the central region of KIF17b, there is a long stalk region containing two coiled-coil domains. This region is known to be a regulatory region controlling, for example, kinesin dimerization (18Woehlke G. Schliwa M. Nature. 2000; 1: 50-58Google Scholar). Interestingly, the original KIF17b clone found in the two-hybrid screen spanned this region, covering amino acids 320-720 of the KIF17b sequence (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The role of this region in the interaction with ACT was confirmed in the yeast interaction assays using full-length ACT and KIF17b deletion mutants. In this assay, the C-terminal region (residues 720-1038 of KIF17b) that corresponds to the classical cargo binding region does not bind to ACT (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the interaction is mediated by the central stalk region of KIF17b (Fig. 1B). Detailed deletion analysis demonstrated that residues 520-620 are essential for the binding of KIF17b to ACT (Fig. 1, B and C). The Ability of KIF17b to Transport ACT Is Independent of the Motor Function—Because the traditional function of kinesins is to carry cargos along microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner, we wanted to investigate whether microtubules and the motor function of KIF17b are needed for its ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and thereby to transport ACT across the nuclear membrane. First, we studied the subcellular localization of full-length KIF17b and of a deletion lacking the N-terminal motor domain (KIF17b-(320-1038)). KIF17b constructs were cotransfected with ACT into COS-1 cells, and immunofluorescence was performed using specific antibodies. As reported previously, KIF17b is able to shuttle between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and to transport ACT from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Wild type KIF17b is mainly cytoplasmic, but a small percentage of the protein is either predominantly in the nucleus or equally distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). When coexpressed in the same cell, ACT follows the localization pattern of KIF17b, as confirmed by labeling cells with the antibody raised against ACT (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (data not shown). As KIF17b-(320-1038) is found both in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, it is evident that deletion of the motor domain does not change the ability of KIF17b to shuttle (Fig. 2, B and C). Nuclei were stained by DAPI to highlight the different localization patterns of KIF17b. A mutant of KIF17b lacking the motor domain still colocalizes with ACT and transports ACT through the nuclear envelope (Fig. 2, B and C). These results indicate that the motor function is not required for KIF17b shuttling or for its ability to determine subcellular localization of ACT. The microtubule independency of KIF17b shuttling was further confirmed by treating cells with a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, colchicine, before immunofluorescence. After the treatment, all microtubules were disrupted, as shown by immunostaining with anti-tubulin antibody. However, KIF17b was still able to shuttle (Fig. 2, D and E) and colocalize with ACT in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2F). PKA Regulates the Subcellular Localization of KIF17b—To identify the signaling pathways involved in regulating KIF17b function, cultured cells overexpressing KIF17b and ACT were treated with various inhibitors to block specific signaling pathways. The percentages of cells expressing KIF17b in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus or diffusely in both compartments were calculated. Normally, 70% of cells express KIF17b predominantly in the cytoplasm. The rest of the cells express KIF17b either mainly in the nucleus or diffusely in both compartments (Fig. 3A, column 1). The protein kinase C inhibitor (Ro-31-8220), mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor (PD 98059), p38 kinase inhibitor (SB 203580), or the inhibitor of small Rho GTPases (Toxin B) had no effect on the localization of KIF17b (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 drastically changed KIF17b localization, decreasing the cytoplasmic fraction of KIF17b and increasing the number of cells expressing KIF17b diffusely in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 3A). The ability of KIF17b to interact and colocalize with ACT was not affected by H-89, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments (data not shown and Fig. 3B). These results strongly suggest that PKA is regulating either the cytoplasmic retention of KIF17b or the transport of KIF17b through the nuclear envelope. The adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 had a similar effect, further confirming the involvement of cyclic AMP and PKA in the regulation of KIF17b movements (Fig. 3C). KIF17b Is Phosphorylated in Cells—Next we wanted to know whether the effect of H-89 on KIF17b localization is mediated by its phosphorylation. Many kinesin family members have been reported to be phosphorylated by various kinases, but whether KIF17b is a phosphoprotein remained unknown. In vivo phosphorylation experiments were performed to investigate whether KIF17b becomes phosphorylated in cultured cells. 36 h after transfection, cells were incubated in a phosphate-free medium with 32P orthophosphate. After immunoprecipitation, phosphorylation of KIF17b was readily detected by autoradiography (Fig. 4A). KIF17b seems to be heavily phosphorylated; both the C terminus and the central region of KIF17b are independently phosphorylated in cells, suggesting the presence of several independent phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4, B and C). KIF17b lacking the N-terminal motor domain seems to be a better substrate for phosphorylation than the full-length protein, indicating a possible role for the motor domain in the control of kinesin phosphorylation. PKA Is Required for KIF17b Phosphorylation in Cells—To study the involvement of various signaling pathways in the phosphorylation of KIF17b, cultured cells overexpressing KIF17b were treated with signaling inhibitors during the incubation with 32P orthophosphate. Interestingly, treatment of the cells with H-89 (but not with the other inhibitors) blocked the phosphorylation of KIF17b (Fig. 5A). This correlates with the effect of H-89 on KIF17b localization and strongly suggests that PKA mediates the phosphorylation of KIF17b in cells. KIF17b is predominantly expressed in testis (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To investigate whether KIF17b can also be phosphorylated in testis, we performed the kinase assay using KIF17b immunoprecipitated from cultured cells as a substrate, and testis extract as a source of kinases. KIF17b was shown to be phosphorylated after incubation with testis extract in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, thus demonstrating that there are active kinases capable of phosphorylating KIF17b in male germ cells (Fig. 5B). Importantly, the KIF17b phosphorylation activity present in testis extracts was also blocked when H-89 was added to the reaction, stressing the importance of the PKA pathway in the phosphorylation of KIF17b in vivo (Fig. 5B). PKA Phosphorylates KIF17b in Vitro—The down-regulation of KIF17b phosphorylation by the PKA inhibitor H-89 suggests that PKA can directly phosphorylate KIF17b. Another possibility is that PKA is a part of a phosphorylation cascade finally leading to modification of KIF17b. PKA was shown to be able to phosphorylate KIF17b, as demonstrated by in vitro phosphorylation assays using the purified catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig. 6A). Software-supported analysis of the KIF17b sequence predicts three potential PKA phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region (serines 729, 893, and 931), and phosphorylation of the region, including these residues (KIF17b-(720-1038)) was also abolished by treatment with H-89 in cultured cells (Fig. 6B). However, a KIF17b mutant protein, with serines 729, 893, and 931 mutated to alanines, was still phosphorylatable in cultured cells to an extent comparable with wild type KIF17b, indicating that these residues are not the unique targets for modification of KIF17b (Fig. 6C). Although the KIF17b/S729A,S893A,S931A mutant is still phosphorylatable, these serine residues were shown to play a role in the localization of KIF17b in cultured cells. Indeed, the Ser→Ala mutation of these sites had a similar effect on the localization of the protein as the treatment of cells expressing the wild type KIF17b with H-89 (Fig. 7). In other words, the solely cytoplasmic localization of the KIF17b/S729A,S893A,S931A mutant was decreased and the diffuse localization increased, as compared with the localization of wild type KIF17b (Fig. 7). Importantly, treatment with H-89 did not influence the localization pattern of the KIF17b/S729A,S893A,S931A mutant (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Mutation of the potential PKA sites in the C terminus of KIF17b affects the subcellular localization of KIF17b. COS-1 cells transfected with wild type KIF17b or mutant KIF17b with serines 729, 893, and 931 mutated to alanines (KIF17b/S729A,S893A,S931A) and ACT were incubated with 10 μm H-89 as indicated; immunofluorescence was performed using the anti-KIF17b antibody. Cells expressing KIF17b in the nucleus, cytoplasm, or in both compartments were counted. The values represent means ± S.D. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinesins are classically known for their motor function and ability to transport cargos along the intracellular microtubule network in an ATP-dependent manner (18Woehlke G.

Kinesins move toward the plus end of the microtubules in contrast to another group of motor proteins, the dyneins, which are minus-end-directed microtubule motors. The discovery of KIF17b as a novel interaction partner for a transcriptional coactivator (ACT) and the ability of this kinesin to transport ACT from the active site of transcription into the cytoplasm has expanded the array of possible functions of kinesins by demonstrating that KIF17b can be directly involved in the regulation of transcription (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here we show that this function is neither dependent on the binding of KIF17b to microtubules nor the ATP-dependent motor function, thus demonstrating a novel microtubule-independent mechanism for KIF17b. Even though the transport of ACT by KIF17b is not dependent on microtubules, KIF17b might have other functions in male germ cells, those mediated through microtubule binding. Indeed, KIF17b expression in male germ cells is not restricted to the stages involving ACT function, but it is also present later in elongating spermatids and mature sperm at a time when the expression of ACT has already disappeared. At these stages of sperm development, KIF17b is associated with the manchette, 2N. Kotaja, and P. Sassone-Corsi, unpublished observations. a structure consisting of microtubules and thought to be involved in the shaping of sperm nucleus (21Kierszenbaum A.L. Tres L.L. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2004; 67: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and in the principal piece of the sperm tail (12Kotaja N. De Cesare D. Macho B. Monaco L. Brancorsini S. Goossens E. Tournaye H. Gansmuller A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10620-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that, after functioning in a microtubule-independent manner in transporting ACT from nucleus to cytoplasm, KIF17b might switch to the microtubule-dependent mode and continue by functioning as a more “traditional” kinesin. This is very likely, because both the manchette and the sperm tail consist of highly organized microtubular arrays. The cargos associated with KIF17b during these stages have not been identified yet. We further characterized the interaction between KIF17b and ACT and demonstrated that it is not a specific LIM domain in ACT but instead the integrity of the LIM domains that is needed for the interaction with KIF17b. This suggests that the general three-dimensional structure of ACT generates the interaction surface. The binding of KIF17b to ACT is not mediated by the C-terminal highly variable region of KIF17b that would correspond to the classical cargo-binding region in many different kinesins (19Kamal A. Goldstein L.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the contrary, ACT binds to the central stalk region of KIF17b, a domain generally thought to be a regulatory region, controlling processes such as kinesin oligomerization (18Woehlke G. Schliwa M. Nature. 2000; 1: 50-58Google Scholar). The binding of ACT to the central stalk region, rather than the C-terminal region, suggests a regulatory role of ACT on KIF17b function. Because the structure of ACT consists only of the LIM domains, known to function as protein-protein interaction surfaces (17Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that ACT might function as a mediator of interactions between the kinesin and some other proteins. Thus, it is possible that ACT is not only transported by KIF17b to the cytoplasm but could also have a more active role in the KIF17b function. Further possible members of this KIF17b-ACT complex remain to be characterized in the future. Both ACT and KIF17b are expressed in round spermatids, where ACT is always nuclear and KIF17b is shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Only in stage IX spermatids, when CREM-dependent transcription ceases and the spermatid nucleus starts to elongate, does ACT relocate to the cytoplasm together with KIF17b (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This movement has to be strictly regulated to avoid premature relocalization of ACT. In this study, we have clarified the signals regulating KIF17b localization by showing that cyclic AMP-dependent PKA controls the subcellular localization and phosphorylation of KIF17b. KIF17b is expressed also in other stages of germ cell development, but the only developmental phase where KIF17b is shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm is in round spermatids, when it transports ACT from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Because the inhibition of PKA signaling disturbs the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of KIF17b, it is likely that the regulation of KIF17 by PKA pathway occurs at this stage of germ cell development. We have found that KIF17b is a phosphoprotein (Fig. 4). It is likely that various protein kinases can phosphorylate KIF17b at many separate sites, but among all the tested signaling pathway inhibitors, PKA inhibitor H-89 was the only drug able to block the phosphorylation in cultured cells. This suggests that PKA is an important regulator of KIF17b phosphorylation. As shown by in vitro phosphorylation assay using the PKA catalytic subunit, KIF17b is a substrate of PKA. However, it is unclear whether KIF17b is phosphorylated directly by PKA in vivo or whether the phosphorylation is mediated by other kinases as a result of signal transduction cascades. KIF17b is heavily phosphorylated, which makes the study of specific phosphorylation sites more difficult. KIF17b contains three consensus PKA sites in its C-terminal region, but mutation of these sites does not abolish its phosphorylation levels in cultured cells. This indicates that other yet unidentified sites can be targets for phosphorylation. The role of PKA in KIF17b regulation may include nuclear import, export, and cytoplasmic retention. The main nuclear localization signals are located in the C terminus of KIF17b, because the fragment of KIF17b containing only the C terminus is localized predominantly in the nucleus, and the KIF17b deletion lacking the C terminus is exclusively cytoplasmic.2 The inhibition of PKA activity changes the localization of KIF17b from only cytoplasmic to nucleocytoplasmic. Therefore, it is likely that the nuclear import is regulated by phosphorylation, and the lack of phosphorylation induces the transport of KIF17b into the nucleus. Another possibility is that the PKA pathway controls the cytoplasmic retention of KIF17b (for example, the binding of KIF17b to specific cytoplasmic structures). When the pathway is blocked, KIF17b starts leaking to the nucleus, thus causing the diffuse localization pattern. The export of KIF17b from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is known to be controlled by the chromosomal region maintenance 1 nuclear export pathway (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, a third possibility is that PKA-mediated phosphorylation stimulates the nuclear export, and in the absence of PKA signaling, the newly synthesized KIF17b is imported into the nucleus but cannot be efficiently exported anymore to the cytoplasm. The PKA holoenzyme consists of two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits. The three different isoforms of somatic catalytic subunits are Cα, Cβ, and Cγ. Cα and Cβ are ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, whereas Cγ is a transcribed transposon that is expressed only in primate testis (22Skålhegg B.S. Taskén K. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cα generates a sperm-specific isoform, Cs, a product of an alternative transcript of the Cα gene (23San Agustin J.T. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3031-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Ullas K.S. Rao M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52673-52680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both Cα and Cs are expressed during spermatogenesis, but their expression is mutually exclusive (24San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cα is expressed in somatic cells, spermatogonia, and preleptotene spermatocytes, whereas Cs is germ cell-specific; it first appears in mid-pachytene spermatocytes, and the expression continues in round and elongating spermatids and finally in the tail of mature sperm (24San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of KIF17b and the Cs catalytic subunit of PKA overlaps in round and elongating spermatids when KIF17b is active in shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, indicating that the Cs catalytic subunit is involved in the phosphorylation of KIF17b at this stage of spermatogenesis. PKA is activated by cyclic AMP produced by adenylate cyclase (AC). In testis, at least two categories of ACs have been described, the membrane-associated ACs that are regulated by G protein-associated receptors and the soluble ACs that are modulated by bicarbonate (26Chen Y. Cann M.J. Litvin T.N. Iourgenko V. Sinclair M.L. Levin L.R. Buck J. Science. 2000; 289: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Both the membrane-bound and -soluble AC isoforms are expressed in postmeiotic round spermatids (27Xie F. Conti M. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), where KIF17b and ACT are active. FSH is a pituitary hormone regulating sperm development through its adenylate cyclase-coupled receptors located at the cell surface of somatic Sertoli cells in the seminiferous epithelium. Sertoli cells are in close contact with germ cells and constantly communicate with these cells and regulate their functions through paracrine signaling and junctions between the Sertoli and germ cells (14Griswold M.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The communication between Sertoli cells and germ cells is not well characterized. Although no adenylate cyclase-coupled FSH receptors have been found on germ cells, PKA activity changes during germ cell differentiation, to reach a maximum level in spermatids (28Lönnerberg P. Parvinen M. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. Persson H. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). cAMP is thought to play an important role in governing the timing of postmeiotic gene activation in response to FSH signaling (29Kangasniemi M. Kaipia A. Mali P. Toppari J. Huhtaniemi I. Parvinen M. Anat. Rec. 1990; 227: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). FSH-stimulated cAMP production is stage-dependent and is particularly significant at stages I-V (30Parvinen M. Endocr. Rev. 1982; 3: 404-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). During these same stages, KIF17b shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (13Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting that this increase in cAMP production could be involved in the regulation of KIF17b movements. Together these results demonstrate a novel, microtubule-independent function for a kinesin motor protein that is regulated by PKA and cAMP, thus linking PKA signaling to the control of CREM-dependent transcription in postmeiotic germ cells. Because ACT is able to enhance CREM transcription in a phosphorylation-independent manner (11Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), it appears that KIF17b and its regulation by PKA offer a new model for cAMP responsiveness of germ cells without the direct phosphorylation of CREM.

SOCS3 is a key negative regulator of interleuking-6 (IL-6) signal transduction. Furthermore, SOCS3 was shown to be phosphorylated upon treatment of cells with IL-2, and this has been reported to regulate its function and half-life. We set out to investigate whether SOCS3 phosphorylation may play a role in IL-6 signaling. Tyrosine-phosphorylated SOCS3 was detected upon treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with IL-6. Interestingly, the observed SOCS3 phosphorylation does not require SOCS3 recruitment to phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) 759 of gp130, and the kinetics of SOCS3 phosphorylation do not match the activation kinetics of the Janus kinases. This suggests that other kinases may be involved in SOCS3 phosphorylation. Using Src and Janus kinase inhibitors as well as Src kinase-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we provide evidence that Src kinases, which we found to be constitutively active in these cells, are involved in the phosphorylation of IL-6-induced SOCS3. In addition, we found that receptor-tyrosine kinases such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor or epidermal growth factor receptor can very potently phosphorylate IL-6-induced SOCS3. Taken together, these results suggest that SOCS3 phosphorylation is not a JAK-mediated phenomenon but is dependent on the activity of other kinases such as Src kinases or receptor-tyrosine kinases, which can either be constitutively active or activated by an additional stimulus.

Activation of the Janus kinases upon IL-6 stimulation induces receptor phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of signaling proteins.

In previous studies it has been demonstrated that overexpression of Janus kinases or the Src kinase Lck leads to SOCS3 phosphorylation (40Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A.

However, the kinase that triggers SOCS3 phosphorylation upon cytokine stimulation has not been identified so far. We set out to investigate SOCS3 phosphorylation in the context of IL-6 signal transduction. We found IL-6-induced SOCS3 to be phosphorylated in MEF cells but that Janus kinases are not responsible for the observed phosphorylation. We provide evidence that IL-6-induced SOCS3 can be phosphorylated by other kinases such as Src kinases or receptor-tyrosine kinases (e.g. EGF receptor or PDGF receptor) in cells where these kinases are either constitutively active or have been activated by an additional stimulus.

Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The preparation of cDNAs encoding different variants of the chimeric receptors EpoR/gp130 was described previously (15Schmitz J. Dahmen H. Grimm C. Gendo C. Müller-Newen G. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These constructs contain the extracellular part of the EpoR and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts of gp130. Chimeric receptor constructs EpoR/gp130 (YF4Y) and EpoR/gp130 (YY4F) contain tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions within the cytoplasmic part of the receptor as indicated. The receptors were subcloned into the pM5 retroviral vector based on the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus containing the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from the negative regulatory factor (NRF) followed by cDNA encoding a green fluorescent protein-Neo fusion protein. Antibodies—For immunoprecipitations a SOCS3 rabbit antibody FA1017 (Fusion Antibodies, Belfast, UK), a SOCS3 rabbit polyclonal antibody C005 (IBL, Hamburg, Germany), and a JAK1-HR785 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) were used. For immunodetection, the following primary antibodies were used unless otherwise noted: SOCS3-M20 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), JAK1-HR785 rabbit polyclonal antibodies JAK2-C20 and JAK3-C21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), TYK2-T20220 (BD Biosciences), Lck-FA1072 antibody (Fusion Antibodies), phosphotyrosine-specific STAT3 (pY705STAT3) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, Frankfurt, Germany), STAT3 mouse antibody (BD Biosciences), green fluorescent protein mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phosphotyrosine-specific Src (pY-418) rabbit polyclonal antibody, and a mixture of the phosphotyrosine mouse antibodies 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Hamburg, Germany) and pY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from DAKO (Hamburg, Germany). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells, Yes/Fyn-deficient cells (Src++), Src/Yes/Fyn-deficient MEF cells (SYF), SYF cells reconstituted with c-Src (SYF+c-Src), MEF cells, A431 (epidermoid cancer cell), and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were purchased from ATCC. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing wild type SOCS3 or mutant SOCS3 (SOCS3-FF) were described previously (41Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The cell lines were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed, Wien, Austria) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Stable MEF cells were cultivated additionally in 1% neomycin (Sigma). COS-7 cells were transfected by the diethylaminoethyldextran method as described previously (49Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar). For stimulation, the cells were starved in medium without fetal calf serum and treated with 20 ng/ml IL-6 and 1 μg/ml sIL-6R, 20 ng/ml OSM, 7 units/ml Epo, 50 ng/ml EGF, or 50 ng/ml PDGF-AB. The inhibitor MG132 was dissolved in Me2SO and used at a concentration of 10 μm. Retroviral Infection of Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts—Retroviral vectors pM5-EpoR/gp130 (6Y), pM5-EpoR/gp130 (YF4Y), and pM5-EpoR/gp130 (YY4F) were introduced into murine embryonic fibroblasts. Briefly, retroviral vectors were transfected together with Ecopack packaging vector and gag-pol vector into Hek293T cells, and after 48 h supernatants were collected and used in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml) for infection of target cells. After 48 h transduced cells were subjected for G418 selection. The expression of the chimeric receptors was verified using Western blotting. A pool of positive cells was used for the experiments. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, about 3 × 107 cells were lysed in 500–800 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μm MG132) for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and cell lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. After removal of the Sepharose, the lysates (1–3 mg of protein) were incubated overnight with specific antibodies at 4 °C. The immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation the beads were washed 3 times with washing buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). The precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Peptide Precipitation Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-hSOCS3 (2 μg) and pEF-YFP-JAK2-JH1 or pEF-YFP-JAK2-JH1 (3 μg). Approximately 3 nm concentrations of biotinylated peptides were immobilized by incubation with 5 mg of NeutrAvidin-coupled Sepharose (Pierce) in 100 μl of lysis buffer PP (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (pH 8.0) per sample. For SOCS3 precipitation, transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer PP supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μm MG132, and the total cell lysates were incubated with the immobilized peptides at 4 °C overnight. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer PP. The precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting and Immunodetection—The electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) by semidry Western-blotting method. Antigens were detected by incubation with specific primary antibodies and horseradish-peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (DAKO). The membranes were developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of Western blot signals was performed using the Quantity one software (Bio-Rad). SOCS3 Phosphorylation Is Observed upon Treatment of MEF Cells with IL-6 or OSM—To investigate whether endogenous SOCS3 can be phosphorylated upon IL-6 stimulation, we treated 2fTGH, 2C4, HepG2, 293T, and MEF cells with IL-6. In 2fTGH, 2C4, HepG2, and 293T cells, IL-6 potently induces the expression of SOCS3 (data not shown). However, we found detectable SOCS3 phosphorylation to occur only in MEF cells treated with IL-6 (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1A, upper panels, shows the kinetics of SOCS3 phosphorylation in MEF cells treated with IL-6 and sIL-6R. Because we found that phosphorylation of SOCS3 destabilizes the protein (43Haan S. Ferguson P. Sommer U. Hiremath M. McVicar D.W. Heinrich P.C. Johnston J.A. Cacalano N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31972-31979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added to facilitate the detection of phosphorylated SOCS3 (pY-SOCS3). SOCS3 phosphorylation was seen after 60 min and persisted up to 180 min. The kinetics of phosphorylation exactly match those of SOCS3 protein expression. A control for which the cells were only treated with MG132 for 180 min (Fig. 1A, lane 7) shows that the inhibition of proteasomal degradation does not by itself lead to the accumulation of SOCS3 protein. To ascertain that the antibody FA1017 (Fusion Antibodies) precipitates the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of SOCS3 equally well, we compared this antibody with a SOCS3 antibody directed against the 18 N-terminal amino acids of SOCS3 (C005; IBL) (Fig. 1A, lower panels). As can be seen in Fig. 1A, lower panels; lanes 4 and 5, both antibodies FA1017 and C005 precipitate equal amounts of pY-SOCS3. The antibody C005 does not recognize the shorter SOCS3 isoform, which lacks the 11 N-terminal amino acids (51Sasaki A. Inagaki-Ohara K. Yoshida T. Yamanaka A. Sasaki M. Yasukawa H. Koromilas A.E. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2432-2436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We next checked whether SOCS3 phosphorylation could also be observed after stimulation of MEF cells with other IL-6-type cytokines. Because these cells express the OSM receptor on their cell surface, we compared IL-6 and OSM in their capacity to induce SOCS3 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1B, pY-SOCS3 was also detected aft"

Prior to secretion, some of these effectors are accompanied by specific type III secretion chaperones. The Yersinia enterocolitica TTSS chaperone SycT escorts the effector YopT, a cysteine protease that inactivates the small GTPase RhoA of targeted host cells. We solved the crystal structure of SycT at 2.5 Å resolution. Despite limited sequence similarity among TTSS chaperones, the SycT structure revealed a global fold similar to that exhibited by other structurally solved TTSS chaperones. The dimerization domain of SycT, however, differed from that of all other known TTSS chaperone structures. Thus, the dimerization domain of TTSS chaperones does not likely serve as a general recognition pattern for downstream processing of effector/chaperone complexes. Yersinia Yop effectors are bound to their specific Syc chaperones close to the Yop N termini, distinct from their catalytic domains. Here, we showed that the catalytically inactive YopTC139S is reduced in its ability to bind SycT, suggesting an ancillary interaction between YopT and SycT. This interaction could maintain the protease inactive prior to secretion or could influence the secretion competence and folding of YopT.

Type three secretion systems (TTSSs) 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type three secretion system; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, DL-dithiothreitol; Bis-Tris propane, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxylmethyl)methylamino]propane. are utilized by various Gram-negative bacteria, pathogens of animals and plants, to inject effector proteins into host cells, where they manipulate cellular functions (1Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cornelis G.R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TTSSs of pathogens share a common ancestor with the most widespread TTSS, the bacterial flagellum (3Gophna U. Ron E.Z. Graur D. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 312: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The core components of TTSS transport machineries are highly conserved, and some are functionally exchangeable among TTSSs (4Ginocchio C.C. Galan J.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 729-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rosqvist R. Hakansson S. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4187-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, TTSS effectors, some of them accompanied by dedicated chaperones, are relatively species-specific because of the particularities of every host-pathogen relationship. TTSS chaperones are characterized as small, acidic proteins that lack ATPase activity and associate with one or several TTSS secretion substrates within bacterial cells (6Page A.L. Parsot C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Feldman M.F. Cornelis G.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 219: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 8Parsot C. Hamiaux C. Page A.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Several functions have been attributed to TTSS chaperones. Phenotypically, these chaperones are required for efficient translocation of their assisted effectors. However, their mode of action remains elusive. Some effectors are poorly soluble in the absence of their chaperones and are apparently stabilized upon their binding. Further, the prevention of unproductive interactions and the maintenance of secretion-competent folding states are discussed. In addition, it was proposed that effector/chaperone complexes could constitute three-dimensional secretion signals (9Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and that chaperones could govern a hierarchical order of effector secretion (9Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6747-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). TTSS chaperones were recently categorized into three classes (8Parsot C. Hamiaux C. Page A.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The class I chaperones specific to a single effector belong to the subgroup IA. Class IB comprises the promiscuous chaperones assisting more than one effector. Chaperones of class II assist the TTSS translocators, and the flagellar TTSS chaperones constitute class III according to this classification.

The fold of the class IB chaperone Spa15 is very similar to that of class IA chaperones; dimer formation, however, is different, with the subunits rotated relative to each other (19Van Eerde A. Hamiaux C. Perez J. Parsot C. Dijkstra B.W. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the flagellar secretion chaperone FliS (class III) reveals a fold distinct from that of pathogenicity-related TTSS secretion chaperones (20Evdokimov A.G. Phan J. Tropea J.E. Routzahn K.M. Peters H.K. Pokross M. Waugh D.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggests that in contrast to the conserved transport machineries of flagella and the TTSSs of pathogens, their accessory chaperones have different evolutionary origins. Structures of class II chaperones have not been solved so far, but the identification of a tetratricopeptide-like repeat motif in Yersinia SycD/LcrH (22Pallen M.J. Francis M.S. Futterer K. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2003; 223: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) supports the view of a fold different from that of class I representatives. Recently, another distinct class of TTSS-related chaperones was disclosed with the crystallization of the EspA filament protein complexed to its antipolymerization chaperone CesA of enteropathogenic E. coli (23Yip C.K. Finlay B.B. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CesA exhibits a highly extended three-helix hairpin forming extensive coiled-coil interactions with EspA. The effector domains bound by class I chaperones typically encompass about 50-100 amino acid residues that are localized at the N terminus directly following the putative secretion signal. Co-crystallization of TTSS chaperones together with effector fragments shed light on the binding mode of these chaperones (9Birtalan S.C. Phillips R.M. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 971-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Stebbins C.E. Galan J.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 16Phan J. Tropea J.E. Waugh D.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1591-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The effector domain is wrapped around the chaperone dimer in an expanded form retaining secondary structure elements. Work from several groups further suggests that the C-terminally located effector domains are folded and catalytically active in the presence of their respective chaperones (9Birtalan S.C.

BMC Microbiol. 2004; 4: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Only recently, the structure of the secretable regulatory TTSS component YopN from Yersinia in complex with the heterodimeric chaperone SycN/YscB was presented (17Schubot F.D. Jackson M.W. Penrose K.J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Plano G.V. Waugh D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This structure unambiguously confirms that the influence of chaperone binding on folding of the secretion substrate is confined to the chaperone-binding site and does not extend globally. The TTSS of pathogenic Yersinia species is used to paralyze host cells such as macrophages by injection of effectors, called Yops (2Cornelis G.R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 291: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One of these effectors, YopT, is the representative of a novel family of cysteine proteases with a catalytic triad formed by residues Cys-139, His-258, and Asp-274 (25Shao F. Merritt P.M. Bao Z. Innes R.W. Dixon J.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 26Zhu M. Shao F. Innes R.W. Dixon J.E. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the Yersinia cytosol, YopT is accompanied by the specific Yop chaperone SycT (27Iriarte M. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Here, we report on the Yersinia enterocolitica SycT structure, a representative of the class IA TTSS chaperones. The only close homologue of SycT (56% identity) is found in the entomopathogenic Photorhabdus luminescens (28Duchaud E. Rusniok C. Frangeul L. Buchrieser C. Givaudan A. Taourit S. Bocs S. Boursaux-Eude C. Chandler M. Charles J.F. Dassa E. Derose R. Derzelle S. Freyssinet G. Gaudriault S. Medigue C. Lanois A. Powell K. Siguier P. Vincent R. Wingate V. Zouine M. Glaser P. Boemare N. Danchin A. Kunst F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). SycT is 20% identical to Yersinia SycE, which has been structurally solved (15Birtalan S. Ghosh P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The SycT-binding site of YopT was located within the first 124 amino acid residues (27Iriarte M. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that a C139S mutation of YopT reduces its SycT binding efficiency, suggesting an accessory interaction between SycT and the catalytic domain of YopT. Recombinant DNA Techniques—The cloning of sycT was as follows. The SycT coding sequence was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CATATGCAGACAACCTTCACAGAACTTATGCA-3′ and 5′-GTCGACTCAGATGAATAATATAGGTGATGTCG-3′, thereby introducing flanking NdeI and SalI restriction sites (underlined). Bacterial lysate from Y. enterocolitica strain WA-314 served as template. The PCR product was subcloned into TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), and the sycT fragment was cut out with NdeI and SalI and inserted into NdeI-SalI-cleaved pWS. pWS is a derivative of pMS470Δ8 (32Balzer D. Ziegelin G. Pansegrau W. Kruft V. Lanka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) generated by cleavage with NdeI and HindIII and insertion of a linker hybridized from 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5′-TATGAAGCTTAGATCTGTCGACGGATC-3′ and 5′-AGCTGATCCGTCGACAGATCTAAGCTTCA-3′. The plasmid pGST-YopT/SycT for simultaneous expression of GST-YopT and SycT was generated as follows. The yopT/sycT region of the Y. enterocolitica strain WA-314 was amplified by PCR using 5′-GGATCCGACAGTATTCACGGACACTACCATAT-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGTCAGATGAATAATATAGGTGATGTCG-3′ primers, thereby introducing restriction sites for BamHI and SmaI as underlined. Corresponding fragments were inserted into glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX-6P3 (Amersham Biosciences). Analogously, pGST-YopTΔ1-22/SycT was generated using the forward primer 5′-GGATCCTCAGCTACACTCACCGAAGGGGTGAT-3′. Generation of pGST-YopTC139S/SycT was performed by overlap PCR (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using primers 5′-CTAGGGGGGCCAGCGAGGCTTTATGTGCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGCACATAAAGCCTCGCTGGCCCCCCTAG-3′. Expression and Purification—SycT was expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Stratagene). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:20 in LB medium and grown at 37 °C. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 nm of ∼0.8 and grown for another 5 h. Cultures were centrifuged (6,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and pellets were frozen. Pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and cell suspensions were passed through a French press (1,000 p.s.i.) twice. Supernatant after centrifugation (20,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C) was adjusted to 32.5% final concentration of (NH4)2SO4 and gently stirred at 4 °C for 2.5 h. Precipitate was collected by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 25% (NH4)2SO4. Precipitate was then solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT overnight at 4 °C. After dialysis, the cleared preparation was loaded on a MonoQ column (HiTrap Q FF, Amersham Biosciences, 5 ml) equilibrated to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. The column was subsequently washed with 10 ml of the equilibration buffer, and then proteins were eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0-100% elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT). SycT eluted at ∼250 mm NaCl. Proper fractions were pooled and concentrated with Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience, polyethersulfone membrane, 30-kDa cut-off). The use of these concentrators was crucial. Concentration devices with regenerated cellulose membranes (Amicon) proved inapplicable to concentrate SycT. The concentrated eluate was finally subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 26/60 column equilibrated to 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl (flow rate 2 ml/min). All chromatographic steps were conducted on an Äkta Explorer system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of GST-fused proteins in E. coli (BL21) was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h in cells growing at 37 °C when A600 nm reached 0.5-0.7. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysozyme (200 μg/ml final concentration). The GST-fused proteins were purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant proteins were eluted off the glutathione beads with 20 mm glutathione in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 50 mm NaCl. Analysis of SycT Binding to GST-YopT Fusion Variants—Glutathione-Sepharose resin was loaded with equal amounts of GST-YopT/SycT, GST-YopTC139S/SycT, or GST-YopTΔ1-22/SycT. Loaded beads were incubated overnight (gently rotating) in 1 or 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Supernatant was removed, and beads were eluted in SDS sample buffer. The eluted samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies raised against YopT and SycT. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals of SycT were grown at 20 °C within 4 days to their final size of 500 × 100 × 50 μm3 by using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The drops contained equal volumes of protein (40 mg/ml) and reservoir solution (1.2 m dl-malic acid, pH 7.0, and 100 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0). Before exposure to X-rays, crystals were soaked in a solution of 1.2 m dl-malic acid, pH 7.0, and 100 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0, 25% glycerol for 30 s and subsequently frozen in a stream of cold nitrogen gas at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems). Multiple anomalous dispersion methods were performed using synchrotron radiation at the BW6 beamline at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron Center (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany. However, crystals severely suffered during their exposure with synchrotron radiation, which resulted in increasing Rmerge values upon their exposure time. Furthermore, SycT crystals showed high anisotropy, in particular at high resolution, which caused tremendous difficulties in obtaining suitable data sets. Molecular replacement using the structure of the monomer or the dimer of SycE (Protein Data Bank ID: 1JYA) as a poly-Ala-model failed, most likely because: 1) the SycT crystals have high anisotropy; 2) the structure of SycT shows significant differences in its dimerization domain, as compared with other Syc proteins; and 3) the primary sequences of both molecules show only 20% sequence identity. Testing a broad variety of SycT crystals, incubated with various heavy metal atom solutions, it turned out that crystals treated with K2PtCl6 for 6 h were most suitable for structure elucidation. After a successful wavelength scan for the platinum absorption edge, data sets were collected on a MAR CCD detector for peak (1.0719 Å), inflection point (1.0723 Å), and remote (0.98 Å) wavelength. Images in frames of 1° were recorded over a range of 360°, resulting in complete anomalous data sets. The space group of ScyT crystals was C2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 91 Å, b = 46 Å, c = 34 Å, and β = 105°. The images were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar) and scaled further with TRUNCATE, CAD, and SCALEIT of the CCP4 software package (35Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The Pt4+ position in the asymmetric unit cell was localized by a combination of direct and difference Patterson search methods using ShelXD (36Schneider T. Sheldrick G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Initial phase angles were calculated with MLPHARE, and the electron density was calculated by Fourier transformation and improved by solvent flattening (35Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Hereby, the hand ambiguity could be solved. However, the quality of the multiple anomalous dispersion-electron density was rather poor, which most likely found its reason in the radiation damage of the crystals during their exposure. Calculating phase angles at the single Pt4+ peak wavelength (single wavelength anomalous dispersion) and using the program SHARP (37Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) resulted in an electron density that allowed interpreting the secondary structure elements of SycT. Conceivable β-strands and helices were traced as polyalanine residues. Subsequent phase combination using the preliminary model and the experimental Pt4+ phase angles was performed with SHARP (37Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Using these improved phase angles, we looked for further derivatives of our measured data sets. We were able to identify a second derivative by difference Fourier analysis and could locate two Pb+ heavy metal atom-binding sites in a data set, in which crystals were soaked for 6 h with Pb(CH3)3Cl. However, the quality of the single wavelength anomalous dispersion peak-Pb+ data set was rather weak as compared with the Pt4+ data set, revealing a figure of merit of 0.62/0.5 (centric/acentric) and a phasing power of 1.4; the Pt4+ data set data showed a figure of merit of 0.77/0.68 and a phasing power of 3.4 (Table I). Although the phasing power of the Pb+ derivative was quite low (mainly caused by the low occupancy of the heavy metal atoms), it could successfully be used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by averaging the Pt4+ and Pb+ electron densities, which allowed us to interpret and to complete the SycT model (both data sets, Pt4+ and Pb+, showed an acceptable estimation in their isomorphous differences). The calculated electron density allowed identifying characteristic side chain residues, thus completing the structure. Continuous model building and refinement was performed with the interactive three-dimensional graphics program MAIN (38Turk D.

https://openalex.org/W1989312964,"The Australian didgeridoo (or yidaki in the Yolngu language of northern Australia) is a simple musical instrument that, at the lips of an experienced player, is capable of a spectacular variety of timbres--considerably greater than those that can be coaxed from orchestral instruments, for example. To understand this phenomenon, we simultaneously measured the sound produced by the didgeridoo and the acoustic impedance of the player's vocal tract. We find that the maxima in the envelope of the sound spectrum are associated with minima in the impedance of the vocal tract, as measured just inside the lips. This acoustic effect is similar to the production of vowel sounds made during human speech or singing, although the mechanism is different, and leads to the surprising conclusion that experienced players are subconsciously using their glottis to accentuate the instrument's tonal variation."
https://openalex.org/W2086390276,"The energetic contributions of individual DNA-contacting side chains to specific DNA recognition in the human papillomavirus 16 E2C-DNA complex is small (less than 1.0 kcal mol-1), independent of the physical and chemical nature of the interaction, and is strictly additive. The sum of the individual contributions differs 1.0 kcal mol-1 from the binding energy of the wild-type protein. This difference corresponds to the contribution from the deformability of the DNA, known as “indirect readout.” Thus, we can dissect the energetic contribution to DNA binding into 90% direct and 10% indirect readout components. The lack of high energy interactions indicates the absence of “hot spots,” such as those found in protein-protein interfaces. These results are compatible with a highly dynamic and “wet” protein-DNA interface, yet highly specific and tight, where individual interactions are constantly being formed and broken.

These results are compatible with a highly dynamic and “wet” protein-DNA interface, yet highly specific and tight, where individual interactions are constantly being formed and broken. A most fundamental issue in protein-DNA recognition is how a protein achieves a high degree of selectivity among different DNA sites of very similar overall structure, containing exquisitely fine differences in their chemical properties (1von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1608-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The specific DNA site location must be kinetically accessible within biologically relevant time scales, given that the specific DNA binding site is immersed in a vast excess of potential nonspecific binding sites. The energetic contributions to the binding of proteins to specific DNA sequences is the result of the formation of an intricate network of contacts between the binding partners, often coupled to conformational rearrangements in either or both macromolecules (2Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Integrated structural and energetic analysis of protein-DNA interaction systems reveals that specific recognition involves direct contacts between the amino acid side chains and DNA bases, a mechanism known as “direct readout” of the DNA sequence (3Gromiha M. Siebers J.G. Selvaraj S. Kono H. Sarai A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The lack of a simple correspondence between amino acid residues and specific DNA bases precludes the identification of a simple code for predicting the observed binding energetics (4Matthews B.W. Nature. 1988; 335: 294-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, the fact that mutations on DNA bases that are not directly contacted by the protein often affect the interaction energetics (5Sarai A. Mazur J. Nussinov R. Jernigan R.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7842-7849Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) implies that local or distant sequence-dependent conformational transitions of the DNA molecule also affect protein-DNA binding, a mechanism termed indirect readout (6Harrington R.E. Winicov I. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 195-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Precisely how these two mechanisms contribute to the overall binding energetics is not known, and statistically based potentials predict that their relative contributions are not the same for all protein-DNA pairs (3Gromiha M. Siebers J.G. Selvaraj S. Kono H. Sarai A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Experimental determination of the energetic contributions of direct and indirect readout requires modification of amino acid side chains and/or DNA bases, perturbations that would normally affect the structural and energetic properties of distant, non-targeted contacts (7Engler L.E.

These mutually dependent effects preclude a straightforward assignment of the energetic contributions to DNA binding in most protein-DNA systems. The DNA binding domain of the papillomavirus E2 transcriptional regulator (E2C) is emerging as a remarkable model system to analyze these effects. E2 proteins bind at multiple sites on the viral and host genomes, regulate the expression of all viral genes, and participate in viral DNA replication (9McBride A.A. Romanczuk H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18411-18414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ham J. Dostatni N. Gauthier J.M. Yaniv M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The E2 binding sites of all viral strains consist of a highly conserved dodecameric sequence, ACCGNNNNCGGT, where N is any base separating the palindromic half-sites. Each half-site is symmetrically contacted by one DNA binding helix of each monomer, forming a discontinuous protein-DNA interface responsible for DNA binding specificity (11Hegde R.S. Annu. Rev.

Meghoo C. Shetty S. Biburger M. Brenowitz M. Hegde R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and recent studies propose a partial structural code for specific site recognition (14Rozenberg H. Rabinovich D. Frolow F. Hegde R.S. Shakked Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15194-15199Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The E2C-DNA system is of particular interest because the interaction involves components of both direct and indirect readouts of the DNA sequence and, in contrast to many other protein-DNA systems, there is an established decoupling between the energetic contributions from both mechanisms (15Zhang Y. Xi Z. Hegde R.S. Shakked Z. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the present study, we experimentally traced the origins of the direct readout energetics by means of a systematic rational perturbation approach of the DNA binding interface and determined that most of the binding energy comes from this recognition mode in this model system. Proteins—Wild-type HPV16 E2C mutants were produced, expressed, and purified as described previously (25Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M. Nadra A.D. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. de Prat-Gay G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14692-14701Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—Samples containing 10 μm E2C proteins were extensively dialyzed against 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6, in 1 mm dithiothreitol, and far UV CD spectra were recorded using the Jasco J810 equipment. Thermal denaturation was followed by the change in molar ellipticity at 225 nm. The data were fitted to a standard concentration-dependent temperature denaturation equation (41Ruiz-Sanz J. de Prat Gay G. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1695-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Determination of the Equilibrium Dissociation Constants—Equilibrium binding of E2C protein to a specific E2 DNA site was carried out by fluorescence spectroscopy as described previously (25Ferreiro D.U.

Briefly, 0.5–50 nm solutions of a fluorescein-labeled DNA oligonucleotide containing a specific HPV16 E2 site in a buffer containing 20 mm bis-Tris 4The abbreviation used is: bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol./HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 m NaCl at 25 ± 0.1 °C were titrated with increasing amounts of the corresponding protein. The data were fitted to a simple quadratic binding equation, and the KD and ΔG were calculated (25Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M. Nadra A.D. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. de Prat-Gay G.

Experimental Design and Characterization of the E2C Mutants—The E2C domain is formed by the homodimerization of two identical polypeptide chains that cooperatively fold (16Mok Y.K. de Prat Gay G.

The structures of E2C-DNA complexes show that the two chains interdigitate at the β-barrel and expose four α-helices, two of which insert into successive major grooves of B-DNA, contacting the ACCG half-sites (12Kim S.S.

Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The macromolecular interface formed by E2C and the DNA site is an intricate network of contacts with electrostatic interactions between the basic side chains of E2C and the DNA phosphate backbone being predominant and direct or water-mediated H-bonds between the side chains and the bases. The central non-contacted spacer sequence is bent toward the minor groove and is responsible for most of the indirect readout contribution observed in this system (15Zhang Y. Xi Z. Hegde R.S. Shakked Z. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To assess the energetic contributions of the nucleotide base to side-chain interactions, we tackled an energetic dissection of the interface contacts by modifying each of the protein side chains by a rational site-directed mutagenesis approach (21Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman & Company, New York1999: 129-131Google Scholar). The E2C domain of the HPV16 viral strain was chosen for this study because it is well characterized biophysically (16Mok Y.K. de Prat Gay G. Butler P.J. Bycroft M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47968-47974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding affinity of HPV16 E2C has a stronger dependence on the spacer sequence of its DNA site when compared with its homologues, which suggests that it displays a maximal decoupling between direct and indirect readout effects (15Zhang Y. Xi Z. Hegde R.S. Shakked Z. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We mutated each contact residue of the DNA binding helix, from Asn-294 to Lys-305, covering the complete binding interface identified in the structure of the HPV18 DNA homologue (Fig. 1c). In addition, we probed the loop connecting β3 and β4, which was shown to contact the DNA backbone in the DNA-E2C (BPV1) homologue (20Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) but appears flexible in HPV strains (11Hegde R.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 343-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), by carrying out five single mutations. Direct Readout Energetics—For a mutagenesis perturbation approach to be interpretable it is essential to carefully test the integrity of the protein in terms of its overall structure and stability. We found that the designed mutations disrupt neither the overall structure of the E2C dimer nor the folding properties described for the wild-type protein, as judged by far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy (Fig. 2, inset B). Moreover, all mutations analyzed were stable and cooperatively folded (Fig. 2, inset A). DNA binding activity of the wild type and each of the mutants was monitored by a fluorescence spectroscopy assay in solution. This allowed us to keep a minimal buffer composition in a well defined chemical environment and detect nanomolar binding affinities accurately (25Ferreiro D.U. Lima L.M. Nadra A.D. Alonso L.G. Goldbaum F.A. de Prat-Gay G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14692-14701Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because the mutant proteins bind to the same target oligonucleotide, the energetic differences can be attributed to the substitutions on the protein side chains, canceling out other effects. The change in binding free energy upon mutation (ΔΔGmut) is defined as ΔΔGmut=ΔGmut-ΔGwt=-RTln(KDmut/KDwt)(Eq. 1) where KDmut and KDwt are the dissociation constants between the oligonucleotide Fl site 35 and the mutant or wild-type protein, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and TABLE ONE.TABLE ONEEnergetics of single side chain substitutions on binding of E2C to its specific DNA targetMutationKDΔΔGaObtained by subtracting the ΔG of the mutants from that of the wild type (WT), 12.1 ± 0.08 kcal mol-1.

A negative sign indicates weaker bindingb The sum of the most conserved substitutions for each side chain contacting the DNA; these substitutions are highlighted in bold Open table in a new tab In general, the energetic perturbation caused by the conservative mutations is small, between 0 and 2.0 kcal mol-1, which means less than 1.0 kcal mol-1 assuming a symmetric energetic contribution by each mutated residue per monomer. In addition, all but one of the mutants show a decrease in binding free energy in the range of the values assigned for similar substitutions in other protein-DNA systems, in line with single side-chain deletion effects (30Oobatake M. Kono H. Wang Y. Sarai A. Proteins. 2003; 53: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 31Jen-Jacobson L. Biopolymers. 1997; 44: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Because our mutational strategy covers more than 95% of the interaction surface and in the absence of any single high energy interaction, we can confidently state that there is no hot spot in this protein-DNA binding interface, such as those described in protein-protein and other protein-DNA interfaces (32Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 33Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 34Anderson E.M. Halsey W.A. Wuttke D.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3751-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, it is safe to assume that the effects of the mutations are local, i.e. the overall structure and stability of the protein-DNA complex is not affected beyond the mutation site. Analysis of Individual Side-chain Interactions—To assign energetic contributions to specific functional groups and validate the mutational strategy at the structural level, particular amino acid side chains were replaced with more than one substitution. Crystallographic data suggested that the -OH motif of Tyr-301 is not involved in direct interactions (12Kim S.S. Tam J.K. Wang A.F. Hegde R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31245-31254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue to Phe has minimal effect in the binding free energy, in agreement with the structural data. The replacement of the same residue with Ala allows us to estimate a contribution of ∼1.0 kcal mol-1 to the interaction with the phenyl group, which is involved in stacking interactions with DNA bases (11Hegde R.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 343-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Kim S.S. Tam J.K. Wang A.F. Hegde R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31245-31254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Replacement of Cys-298 with either Ser, Ala, or Gly causes the same decrease in binding energy, indicating that the interactions that this residue makes cannot be replaced by its structural homologue Ser and that the conformational restrictions around the Cys-298 ϕ-Ψ backbone angles do not play a significant role in DNA recognition. It is not clear whether the loop connecting strands 2 and 3 (β2–β3 loop) participates in DNA binding, because it faces the “non-contacting spacer” region of the E2 site (12Kim S.S. Tam J.K. Wang A.F. Hegde R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31245-31254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and it is apparently too flexible to be observed in the crystal structures of the different HPV E2C variants obtained so far (18Liang H. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Yoon H.S. Egan D.A. Walter K. Holzman T.F. Robins T. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Nadra A.D. Eliseo T. Mok Y.K. Almeida C.L. Bycroft M. Paci M. de Prat-Gay G. Cicero D.O. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis approach allows us to conclude that the positively charged Lys-325 and Lys-327 residues in the β2–β3 loop do participate in coulombic interactions, presumably with the DNA phosphate backbone, because replacement of both with Ala causes a decrease in binding free energy of ∼0.5 to ∼1.0 kcal mol-1. This decrease is completely restored if the residues are replaced by Arg, suggesting that these residues participate in a nonspecific contact with the DNA backbone, which lacks strong geometrical constraints. Conversely, this compensatory effect is not observed in the Lys to Arg substitution made at the center of the binding helix, where the mutation K297R severely affects the binding affinity, indicating a strong steric hindrance (TABLE ONE). Residue Val-324 of the β2–β3 loop does not contribute to the binding energy. Lys-304 interacts with phosphate groups, contributing 1.4 kcal mol-1 to binding energy. Two other residues that contact the phosphate backbone are Thr-295 and Arg-300 (12Kim S.S. Tam J.K. Wang A.F. Hegde R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31245-31254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). T205A is the only replacement that showed a mild albeit significant increase in affinity (0.8 kcal mol-1, 0.4 kcal mol-1 per symmetric single interaction) that could be explained by less favorable interactions made by the Thr -OH group in the wild-type protein, but a double mutation or fine structural data would be required to confirm it. Replacement of Arg-300 by Met causes a decrease in binding energy of 1.3 kcal mol-1, most likely resulting from the contribution of an electrostatic interaction with a DNA backbone phosphate. The energetic values measured for each group are small, in the order of the thermal energy at room temperature (∼0.6 kcal mol-1). This suggests that the protein-DNA interface presents a highly dynamic character at physiological temperatures. For some protein-protein interaction systems, the energetic effect on point substitutions correlates with structural parameters, such as the change in solvent-accessible surface area (33Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). We found a poor correlation between the observed ΔΔG and the change in solvent-accessible surface area, molecular surface, or the number of contacts deleted by mutation (not shown). The Energetic Contribution of Side Chains Is Strictly Additive—For the analysis of the DNA binding interface, we interpreted the effects of mutation on a strictly local basis, and as such, the observed energetic differences are likely to be additive (8Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Jacobson L.A. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 32Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This is also an assumption of most of the theoretical models of protein-DNA interaction developed to date (35Selvaraj S. Kono H. Sarai A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Luscombe N.M. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 991-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To confirm our experimental results, we engineered E2C proteins carrying two substitutions and measured the change in binding affinity compared with the individual single mutations, thus constructing a double mutant cycle (21Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman & Company, New York1999: 129-131Google Scholar). If the effects of deletion of side chains are independent, the observed change in free energy for the double mutant i+j should be equal to the sum of the independent mutations, ΔΔGi+j=ΔGi+j-ΔGwt(Eq. 2) ΔΔGi+j=ΔΔGi+ΔΔGj(Eq. 3) where ΔΔGi, j are the difference in free energy changes associated with the corresponding single amino acid substitutions. The results for five double mutants are shown in TABLE TWO. The additive nature of side-chain contributions to DNA binding is evident in all cases, which include the combination of polar, charged, or hydrophobic interactions, even for residues that are close in sequence. These results validate the underlying assumption and allow us to extend and analyze the overall energetic contributions of site-specific recognition by E2C.TABLE TWOEffects of double side-chain substitutions on E2C-DNA bindingMutationPredicted ΔΔGi+jaAs predicted by the sum of the effects of the individual substitutions, shown in TABLE ONEMeasured ΔΔGi+jbMeasured relative to the wild-type proteinkcal mol-1kcal mol-1C298A + R300M–2.55 ± 0.16–2.52 ± 0.50C298A + N294A–2.97 ± 0.34–2.93 ± 0.19Y301A + N294A–2.75 ± 0.32–2.76 ± 0.41C298A + K297A–3.11 ± 0.16–3.18 ± 0.15Y301A + K297A–2.89 ± 0.16–3.26 ± 0.49a As predicted by the sum of the effects of the individual substitutions, shown in TABLE ONEb Measured relative to the wild-type protein Open table in a new tab If the effects of direct and indirect readout mechanisms are independent, the net free energy change on binding (ΔGb) can be decomposed into ΔGb∼ΔGdir+ΔGind(Eq. 4) where ΔGdir and ΔGind are the free energies attributed to each mechanism. Moreover, if the direct readout contributions are additive, ΔGdir can be estimated by the sum of all individual contacting mutations. Therefore, we can estimate that the overall contribution from the direct readout mechanism will be -11.1 ± 0.5 kcal mol-1 (TABLE ONE). The free overall binding energy, obtained from the measured association constant of wild-type E2C, is -12.1 ± 0.08 kcal mol-1. Thus the binding process is 90% direct readout, and we assign the 1.0 kcal mol-1 difference to indirect readout, where the “bendability” of the spacer sequence and adaptation to the irregular binding surface are reported to facilitate DNA binding by E2 proteins (11Hegde R.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 343-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Kim S.S. Tam J.K. Wang A.F. Hegde R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31245-31254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, using a combined theoretical and experimental approach using cyclic DNA molecules and gel-shift binding assays, Zhang et al. (15Zhang Y. Xi Z. Hegde R.S. Shakked Z. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8337-8341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) determined recently that the indirect readout contribution in this system lies between 1.0 and 3.0 kcal mol-1. The E2C-DNA complex is an excellent protein-DNA interaction model where a priori chosen mechanistic modes of interaction, indirect and direct readout, can be dissected. Mutations of the DNA bases “read” by the protein often lead to non-local conformational changes in the DNA structure that ultimately affect the binding affinity (37Kurpiewski M.R. Engler L.E. Wozniak L.A. Kobylanska A. Koziolkiewicz M. Stec W.J. Jen-Jacobson L. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1775-1788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To avoid this problem, we perturbed the protein-DNA interface by changing the protein side chains that build up this interface. By carrying out direct and accurate experimental measurements in solution, we were able to quantify the contribution of individual groups to binding free energy. The contribution is small, irrespective of the nature of the interfacial bond, i.e. coulombic, hydrogen bond, or Van der Waals. We determined that at least 90% of the binding energy in this system comes from the direct readout of the DNA sequence and the rest from indirect readout. We showed that the local energetic perturbations behave in an additive manner and confirmed it by a series of double mutant cycles, without any single side-chain interface interaction accounting for drastic changes in binding energy as found in protein-protein interface hot spots (32Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The absolute free energy change assigned to each contact is small, near the reference value of the kinetic energy available at physiological temperatures. We interpret the observed effects as small perturbations in a complex interaction network that is robust and flexible enough to tolerate point modifications of its constitutive elements. The emerging picture for this system is of a highly solvated and dynamic interface. Water-mediated interactions appear to be as important as direct hydrogen bonds for the establishment of stability and specificity in molecular recognition; however, this is not a straightforward rationale (38Janin J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R277-R279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The number of interface waters from crystallographic and solvent perturbation studies is probably underestimated (29Lima L.M. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47968-47974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Janin J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R277-R279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The complex between the E2C domain and DNA is a paradigmatic example for a wet protein-DNA interface as opposed to a “dry” interface represented by the TATA box-binding protein (38Janin J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R277-R279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The BPV1 E2C-DNA complex was shown to have 42 water molecules mediating protein-DNA interactions (20Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B.

Although the exclusion of bulk solvent is a late but essential step in the kinetic binding mechanism of E2C to specific DNA and to a lesser extent for nonspecific DNA (26Ferreiro D.U. de Prat-Gay G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a substantial number of water molecules remain at this model interface, and this appears to be essential for its recognition mechanism. It remains to be established how different categories of water molecules playing different roles in specificity, stability, and dynamics participate at the protein-DNA interface. It appears plausible that water molecules are constantly filling gaps in this interface, where the different bonds are constantly being formed and broken. Water itself could help rearrange spaces left by absent interacting groups with a minimum energetic penalty, something that is not easy to picture in a dry interface, whether it is a protein-protein or protein-DNA interface. DNA recognition by the E2C domain in papillomaviruses is at the center of transcription control and the initiation of viral DNA replication. Related to this particular system, we were able to establish that a flexible loop participates in nonspecific electrostatic interactions with the DNA backbone, something so far not observed because of the lack of crystallographic densities around this region. In addition, a conserved Cys residue, unusual at DNA binding interfaces (20Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), appears not to be taking place in hydrogen bonding; rather, the hydrophobic nature of the sulfur atom appears to be participating in a key interaction. NMR studies of the E2C-DNA complex will be essential for integrating structural, mutagenesis, thermodynamic, kinetic, and dynamic studies. Finally, the binding energy values measured for side chains of different chemical properties and the interpretation of multiple replacements at a single residue will hopefully contribute to the understanding of the role of non-covalent interactions in protein-DNA recognition (40Pabo C.O. Nekludova L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 597-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and provide absolute energetic parameters that may be used in theoretical approaches.

We reported here the role of angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), which is a prosurvival factor in endothelial cells, during endothelial cell damage induced by oxidative stress. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) increased apoptosis of endothelial cells through JNK activation, whereas Ang1 inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis and concomitant JNK phosphorylation. The inhibition of H2O2-induced JNK phosphorylation was reversed by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and dominant-negative Akt, and constitutively active-Akt attenuated JNK phosphorylation without Ang1. These data suggested that Ang1-dependent Akt phosphorylation through PI 3-kinase leads to the inhibition of JNK phosphorylation. H2O2-induced phosphorylation of SAPK/Erk kinase (SEK1) at Thr261, which is an upstream regulator of JNK, was also attenuated by Ang1-dependent activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. In addition, Ang1 induced SEK1 phosphorylation at Ser80, suggesting the existence of an additional signal transduction pathway through which Ang1 attenuates JNK phosphorylation. These results demonstrated that Ang1 attenuates H2O2-induced SEK1/JNK phosphorylation through the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway and inhibits the apoptosis of endothelial cells to oxidative stress."

A direct interaction of the CD2BP2-GYF domain with the novel protein interaction partners PI31 and NPWBP was verified by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The CD2BP2 protein is a cellular adapter protein that was originally identified as a binding partner of the T cell adhesion protein CD2 in the context of T cell signaling (1Nishizawa K. Freund C. Li J. Wagner G. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14897-14902Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a nuclear role for CD2BP2 was suggested, based on reports that identified CD2BP2 as a protein associated with spliceosomal complexes and proteins involved in splicing (2Hartmuth K. Urlaub H. Vornlocher H.P. Will C.L. Gentzel M. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16719-16724Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 3Kofler M. Heuer K. Zech T.

CD2 and SmB/B′ share the presence of (R/K/G)XXP-PGX(R/K) motifs that were shown to bind to CD2BP2 in vitro and in vivo (1Nishizawa K. Freund C. Li J. Wagner G. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biol. 1999; 6: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CD2BP2 contains a C-terminal fragment of ∼60 amino acids that confers binding to these proline-rich sequences. Structurally, this so-called GYF domain represents a small α/β protein that displays a set of aromatic residues from a unique bulge-helix-bulge motif creating a hydrophobic pocket accommodating the PPG core of the binding peptide (1Nishizawa K.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5985-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition to this core sequence, the positively charged arginine residues in the vicinity of the PPG motif contribute to binding of the CD2 and SmB/B′ ligand. Interestingly, the PPPPGHR motifs in CD2 can also be bound by the SH3 domain of the Fyn tyrosine kinase and show that proline-rich sequence recognition has ultimately to be viewed across domain borders (5Freund C. Kuhne R. Yang H. Park S. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5985-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Functionally the protein-protein interactions mediated by the PPPPGHR motifs are associated with a modulation in CD2-mediated signaling events, as for example interleukin-2 production (6Chang H.C. Moingeon P. Pedersen R. Lucich J. Stebbins C. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Hahn W.C. Bierer B.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1831-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the case of the CD2BP2-SmB/B′ interaction, it was shown that both proteins colocalize to the nucleus of Jurkat and HeLa cells and that the GYF domain of CD2BP2 can coprecipitate SmB/B′ from cellular lysates (3Kofler M. Heuer K. Zech T. Freund C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28292-28297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, CD2BP2 has not been detected in the active spliceosome (8Makarova O.V. Makarov E.M. Urlaub H. Will C.L. Gentzel M. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2381-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and its role in splicing or splicing-associated processes is still poorly understood. Because proline-rich sequence recognition is characterized by high off-rates and limited specificity (9Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), additional intracellular proteins are likely to interact with CD2BP2-GYF. Therefore, we attempted to find new binding partners for CD2BP2 based on the recognition code of its GYF domain. Our results show that in addition to CD2 and SmB/B′ several human proteins contain high affinity target sites for the CD2BP2-GYF domain. Yeast two-hybrid analyses confirm that two of these novel interactions, namely with NPWBP and PI31, can take place under cellular conditions. Constructs and Protein Expression—The recombinant expression of the GYF domain and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) 2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein.-GYF fusion protein used in this study was performed according to published protocols (3Kofler M. Heuer K. Zech T. Freund C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28292-28297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For yeast two-hybrid analysis, full-length CD2BP2 or a fragment comprising residues 256–342 was cloned into pGADT7 (Clontech) via the NcoI-BamHI and the EcoRI-BamHI restriction sites, respectively. Fragments of the proteins AKNA-(795–894), MAGD1-(357–514), NEDD4-(267–328), NPWBP-(388–551), PI31-(214–271), SmB-(148–231), SWAN-(700–869), and WWP2-(293–491) were amplified from the following cDNA clones obtained from the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH: DKFZp667H017Q2 (AKNA), IRALp962H0828Q2 (MAGD1), IRAK-p961C1479Q2 (NED-D4), IRALp962P0114Q2 (NPWBP), IRAKp961G1751Q2 (PI31), IMA-Gp998D118415Q3 (SmB), IRAL-p962K1725Q2 (SWAN), and IRAK-p961B0119Q2 (WWP2). These fragments, comprising the proline-rich regions of the respective proteins, were inserted into pGBKT7 vector via NcoI-NotI restriction sites. The fragment coding for the cytoplasmic tail of CD2-(245–351) was inserted into the pGBKT7 via the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. Cloning of the focused library RKRSHRXXPPPXXXVQ into PC89 was similar to the procedure described elsewhere (10Felici F. Castagnoli L. Musacchio A. Jappelli R. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). PC89 and the PC89-nonapeptide-library (X9) were a gift from Gianni Cesareni (Dipartimento di Biologia, Universita di Roma). Phage Display—Phage displaying the nonapeptide (X9) or the focused peptide library fused to the major capsid protein was produced by transforming Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells with PC89 constructs followed by superinfection with the VCS-M13 helper phage (Stratagene). After overnight incubation in 2xYT medium in the presence of ampicillin and kanamycin (30 °C, 270 rpm), phage particles were purified by three polyethylene glycol/NaCl precipitations (11Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Benzinger R. Lawhorne L. Treiber G. Virology. 1970; 40: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Library screening was performed as follows: 30–50 μl of GST-GYF-loaded glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with 5 × 109–5 × 1011 infectious particles at 4 °C overnight in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, bound phages were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.2. For phage amplification, E. coli XL-1 Blue cells were infected with eluted phage followed by superinfection with helper phage and subsequent incubation as described above. After three or six rounds of panning, the inserts of selected phage were sequenced to identify their displayed peptide. SPOT Analysis—Peptides were synthesized on Whatman 50 paper using an Auto-Spot Robot (ASP 222; Invartis AG, Köln, Germany). Peptide synthesis using Fmoc chemistry on β-alanine-functionalized cellulose membranes was performed according to standard protocols (12Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 25-39PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with GST-GYF protein as described elsewhere (13Heuer K. Kofler M. Langdon G. Thiemke K. Freund C. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 603-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes were incubated with GST-GYF (40 μg/ml) overnight. After washing, bound GST fusion protein was detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibodies (Z-5; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Rockland). An enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal West Pico; Pierce) was used for detection by a Lumi-Imager™ (Roche Applied Science). Preparation of Peptides—Peptides were synthesized automatically (ABI 433A) by the solid phase method using standard Fmoc chemistry in a batch-wise mode as described previously for the synthesis of CRF analogs (14Beyermann M. Fechner K. Furkert J. Krause E. Bienert M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3324-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After final cleavage/deprotection using trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (9/1), crude peptides were purified by preparative HPLC to give final products of 95% purity according to HPLC analysis. The expected masses of peptides were verified by mass spectrometry. NMR Titration Experiments—All NMR experiments were performed at 297 K using either Bruker DRX600 or DMX750 instruments equipped with standard triple resonance probes. Data processing and analysis were carried out with the XWINNMR (Bruker) and SPARKY (version 3.1, T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco) software packages. In the NMR titration experiments, increasing amounts of synthetic peptides were added to a 0.2-mm sample of the 15N-labeled CD2BP2-GYF domain. The gradual change of chemical shifts in the HSQC spectra allowed the resonances of the ligand-bound GYF domain to be unambiguously assigned. The sum of the chemical shift changes for 15N and 1H atoms in a sample with peptide was determined as [(Δ1H)2 + (Δ15N)2]1/2, where Δ1H is in units of 0.1 ppm, and Δ15N is in units of 0.5 ppm. Data were analyzed with the Microcal™ Origin™ program, assuming a simple two-state binding model. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed with the MATCHMAKER GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 according to the manufacturer's manual (Clontech). The yeast strain AH109 was cotransformed with the pGBKT7 bait constructs encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to the proline-rich regions of selected candidates and full-length CD2BP2 or its GYF domain in pGADT7. Colonies were grown on low, medium, or high stringency (synthetic drop-out) media without the amino acids Leu and Trp, or His, Leu, and Trp, or Ala, His, Leu, and Trp, respectively). Phage Display and Peptide Substitution Analysis—The sequence requirements for the binding of peptides to the CD2BP2-GYF domain were analyzed by screening either a focused library of the format X2PPPX3, or of a randomized X9 phage display library. For both libraries, similar results were obtained (TABLE ONE). Almost all sequences contain the PPG motif, in agreement with the previously defined recognition signature (R/K/G)XXPPGX(R/K) (3Kofler M. Heuer K. Zech T. Freund C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28292-28297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and SPOT analysis confirmed that only peptides comprising the PPG motif conferred binding to the CD2BP2-GYF domain (TABLE ONE). A third, N-terminal proline is often present in peptides selected from the X9 library, but other amino acids are also found at this position, indicating that an extended stretch of PPII helix is not required for binding. Tryptophan is preferably selected as the amino acid C-terminal adjacent to glycine. Other hydrophobic amino acids like phenylalanine, tyrosine, methionine, and leucine were also observed at this position, whereas the β-branched valine and isoleucine side chains were not found. Of 62 sequences analyzed only one sequence contained the CD2 motif PPPGHR. Interestingly, for peptides containing the PPGW motif, no requirement for the presence of a positively charged amino acid was observed. This is in contrast to the recognition signature PPGX(R/K) of peptides derived from previous studies on CD2 and SmB/B′ and termed the CD2 class of peptides in this study (1Nishizawa K. Freund C. Li J. Wagner G. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14897-14902Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Kofler M. Heuer K. Zech T. Freund C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28292-28297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, based on the phage display results, we suggest a second class of ligands for the CD2BP2-GYF domain, the PPGW class, which does not depend on positively charged amino acids, flanking the motif. In the case of the CD2 class, the non-conserved residue neighboring glycine within the PPGX(R/K) motif points away from the GYF domain surface, whereas the arginine or lysine side chain at position i+2 (relative to glycine at position i) contributes van der Waals interactions via its aliphatic CH2 groups, thereby placing its charged head group relatively close in space to the negatively charged side chains of Glu-9, Glu-15, and Asp-36 of the GYF domain (5Freund C. Kuhne R. Yang H. Park S. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5985-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In contrast, for the PPG(W/F/Y/M/L)-containing peptides, a hydrophobic interaction between the peptide residue following glycine (W/F/Y/M/L) and residue Trp-8 of the domain is likely to take place.TABLE ONEPhage display results after 3 and 6 rounds of panning with the X9 and the X2PPPX3 libraries The CD2BP2 GST-GYF fusion construct was used for screening. The consensus is derived from results of both library screens, except of the number of prolines, which was deduced exclusively from the screen with the X library. The relaxed consensus is defined to include all binding peptides. The triple-proline stretch in the focused library as well as prolines of the binding motif are depicted in white letters with gray background. Other residues with significant presence in both screens are shown in white with black background. Motifs of selected sequences after 6 rounds of panning and the CD2-derived control peptide SHRPPPPGHR were subject to SPOT analysis, performed as described in Fig 2.FIGURE 1Suggested model of the binding mode of the PPGX(R/K) (left panel) and PPGW (right panel)-containing peptides. Side chains of the GYF domain that create the “walls” of the pocket are shown as rhombic structures, with the conserved Phe-20, Trp-28, and Tyr-33 residues marked in black and the CD2BP2-GYF-specific residues Trp-8, Glu-15, and Tyr-17 depicted as white letters on gray background. The respective peptides are shown in ball and stick representation. The charge complementarity between the peptide arginine of the CD2 class peptides and the negatively charged surface of the GYF domains is indicated by an arrow (left panel). In the case of the PPGW class the Trp-8 of the domain and the tryptophan of the peptide are suggested to form hydrophobic interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further corroborate the conclusions drawn from the phage display analysis, the peptide of the melanoma-associated antigen D1 (MAGD1) containing the central PPGW motif was subjected to SPOT analysis. Fig. 2A shows the result for a cellulose membrane, where each position of the binding peptide was individually exchanged by all other naturally occurring amino acids. The motif PPG is indispensable for binding and a preference for Trp, Phe, Tyr, and Leu at the position adjacent to the PPG core could be observed. The Trp → Arg/Lys mutants also show strong spot intensity, and according to our model (Fig. 1) a partial switch from the PPGW class binding mode to the CD2 class binding mode for the resulting PPG+ motif would account for the binding. In accordance with the results from phage display, we do not observe a modulation of binding affinities for positions flanking the PPGW motif. This implies that charge complementarity, as was observed for the CD2 peptide, does not play a significant role for the MAGD1 peptide. To better understand this difference between the two classes of peptides, we performed analysis of peptides, where two positions were mutated. In Fig. 2B the results of a double substitution analysis for peptides of the sequence SHX1PPPPG(H/A/F/L/W)X2V are shown. Although the excess of a single negative charge in the PPG(H/A/L)-containing peptides abolishes binding, the PPG(F/W)-containing peptides tolerate a negative net charge of -1. The H9W and H9F substitutions obviously override, to a certain degree, the influence of the arginine residues flanking the core motif. This suggests that the aromatic residues interacting with the domain, presumably with Trp-8, substitute for the interactions mediated by arginine in the CD2 class of ligands (Fig. 1). Selection of Putative Interaction Peptides by Data Bank Analysis— The phage display results define the relaxed consensus PPG(A/E/F/H/I/L/M/S/T/W/Y) as the signature that should comprise all high affinity binding motifs for the CD2BP2-GYF domain. In addition, the presence of two such motifs that are close in sequence will enhance avidity and represent more likely interaction sites, as has been shown for the repetitive PPPPGHR motif in the CD2 cytoplasmic tail (5Freund C. Kuhne R. Yang H. Park S. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5985-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The SwissProt and TREMBL databanks were searched for proteins that contain at least two of the relaxed consensus sites or a single strict consensus motif PPGW. Subsequently the individual peptides from the respective proteins were synthesized on a cellulose membrane and tested for binding to a GST-GYF fusion protein. The results are presented in Fig. 3 and show that many of the natural sequences are bound by CD2BP2-GYF. We observed that the domain bound preferentially to neutral or positively charged peptides, including CD2 class ligands (data not shown). In the few cases of efficient binding to a negatively charged peptide, tryptophan or phenylalanine following the PPG motif was found, in agreement with our results from the double substitution analysis (Fig. 2B). Based on the intensities of the spots, the peptides were sorted and a set of candidates containing several binding sites, of which at least one fits to the strict consensus PPG(W/F/Y/M/L), were selected for further analysis (TABLE TWO).TABLE TWOSelected candidates for yeast two-hybrid analysis from the human proteome analysis Candidates were selected according to binding strength and number of motifs present in the target protein.

Analysis of Selected Peptides in Vitro—To independently confirm the binding of the CD2BP2-GYF domain to peptides identified as binders by phage display and SPOT analysis, NMR titration experiments were performed (Fig. 4). Because GYF domain and peptide are in fast exchange with respect to the NMR time scale, the change of individual NH resonances in dependence of ligand concentration could be followed and a dissociation constant (KD) could be determined when a simple two-state binding mechanism was assumed. All of the putative target peptides bound to the GYF domain, and the KD varied between 13 μm for the phage display-derived peptide (PD1 peptide) EFGPPPGWLGR and 159 μm for the CD2 control peptide SHRPPPPGHRV. This result shows that the phage display method indeed selected for a high affinity ligand. The NMR experiments also enabled the binding epitope for the different peptides to be determined. The differences in chemical shift between unligated and bound GYF domain for individual residues are shown in Fig. 4B and clearly indicate that the major interaction surface is comprised by the bulge-helix-bulge motif of the domain, as was previously shown in detail for the GYF-CD2 peptide complex. The number of NH groups of the GYF domain that display significant chemical shift changes is similar for all peptides, showing that an extension of the GYF domain interaction epitope is not required for binding of the different peptide classes (Fig. 4B). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—To obtain evidence that the GYF-peptide interactions can take place in the context of the corresponding proteins within a cellular environment, full-length CD2BP2 or its GYF domain alone were cloned into the prey vector and fragments of putative interaction partners were cloned into the corresponding bait vector of the Clontech yeast two-hybrid system. Possible interaction partners selected for the analysis were AKNA, MAGD1, NEDD4, NPWBP, SWAN, and WWP2, comprising PPGW class interaction sites, the two known interaction partners CD2 and SmB, belonging to the CD2 class, and PI31, which contains a binding site of each class (TABLE TWO). In Fig. 5, the results of this interaction trap analysis are shown. Some of the putative binding partners, namely MAGD1, NEDD4, and WWP2, show autoactivation when transformed as bait construct into yeast; therefore, potential interactions cannot be analyzed by this method. AKNA fails to interact with any of the CD2BP2 constructs. SWAN seems to promote only weak or even unspecific interactions with the CD2BP2-GYF construct under growth conditions repressing its intrinsic autoactivity. In these two cases, folding of the fragments might render the binding motifs inaccessible. Alternatively, these fragments may not be stably expressed in yeast in order to promote interactions with the CD2BP2-GYF domain. However, NPWBP and PI31, in addition to CD2 and SmB, clearly result in selective colony growth, indicative of protein-protein-mediated activation of the reporter genes. This interaction occurred for the full-length CD2BP2 and the GYF domain-only constructs, verifying that these interactions are mediated by the GYF domain. In this study we have used phage display and peptide substitution analysis to derive the recognition code for the CD2BP2-GYF domain. Furthermore, the experimental data were used to highlight binding motifs within natural proteins by profile-based data base searches. Peptides derived from these proteins comprising the suggested binding motif were validated for binding on cellulose membranes, and subsequently proteins of interest were subjected to a yeast two-hybrid analysis. Interestingly, the CD2 motif SHRPPPPGHRV is a suboptimal ligand that binds with a 10-fold lower affinity when compared with the optimal phage display motif EFGPPPGWLGR. However, the presence of two such suboptimal motifs enhances the interaction and results in yeast two-hybrid interactions that lead to growth on selective media (Fig. 5). The same argument holds true for the SmB/B′ C-terminal tail, but in this case 3–4 partially intercalated GYF binding motifs are displayed by the protein. According to the results presented here, a second class of ligands was defined, the PPGW class, in addition to the previously described CD2 class (3Kofler M. Heuer K. Zech T. Freund C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28292-28297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The first class of ligands is characterized by the motif PPG(W/F/Y/M/L) and shows reduced charge dependence. Especially aromatic residues render the interaction tolerant to negative charges. The second class requires a positive charge two positions C-terminal to the PPG core sequence and is defined in this study as PPGX(R/K). For this class, it was shown that avidity effects due to the presence of repetitive motifs compensate the low affinity of individual binding sites and constitute relevant in vivo interaction sites (3Kofler M. Heuer K. Zech T. Freund C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28292-28297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Freund C. Kuhne R. Yang H. Park S. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5985-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The occurrence of a defined set of GYF domain-containing proteins in most, if not all, eukaryotic species raises the question whether the function of GYF domain-containing proteins has been conserved. In humans CD2BP2 has been identified as an interaction partner of SmB/B′, and other proteins associated with spliceosomal complexes also comprise potential GYF domain binding sites (3Kofler M. Heuer K. Zech T. Freund C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28292-28297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The yeast homolog of CD2BP2, LIN1, was identified as an interaction partner of the essential splicing protein PRP8 (15Bialkowska A. Kurlandzka A. Yeast. 2002; 19: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The authors of this study suggest two proline-rich sequences at the N terminus of PRP8 to be responsible for binding to the GYF domain of LIN1. One of these motifs, PPGF, is also found at the C terminus of the yeast homolog of SmB. Therefore, the interaction between GYF domains of CD2BP2-like proteins and splicing-associated proteins, notably SmB, might be conserved across species. The PI31 protein was characterized recently as a protein that inhibits the proteasome in vitro (16McCutchen-Maloney S.L. Matsuda K. Shimbara N. Binns D.D. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18557-18565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Later the protein was shown to be a regulator of the immunoproteasome, thereby modulating the presentation of peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (17Zaiss D.M. Standera S. Kloetzel P.M. Sijts A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14344-14349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our analysis clearly shows the PI31 protein to contain favorable interaction sites for the CD2BP2-GYF domain in vitro. However, the critical questions are whether the interaction will take place in living cells and whether the two proteins compartmentalize to the same locale in vivo. Confocal microscopy of GFP and YFP variants of the two proteins shall reveal whether colocalization can be observed under certain cellular conditions. A further interesting candidate that matched the selection criteria of our protocol is the nuclear protein NPWBP (alternatively named WBP11, SNP70, or SIPP1). This protein was initially described as a nuclear protein with RNA binding capability that associates with the protein Npw38 (18Komuro A. Saeki M. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36513-36519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A subsequent study that more extensively investigated the localization of NPWBP showed a cytoplasmic localization in dividing cells, while partial colocalization with perinuclear intermediate filaments in human embryonic kidney 293 cells could be observed (19Craggs G.

Recently, NPWBP has been described as a component of the spliceosome (20Zhou Z. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 419: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) and was specifically identified as a protein of the U4/U6 snRNP (8Makarova O.V. Makarov E.M. Urlaub H. Will C.L. Gentzel M. Wilm M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2381-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The proline-rich sequences of NPWBP that interact with CD2BP2-GYF were also shown to interact with the WW domain of Npw38 (18Komuro A. Saeki M. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36513-36519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both Npw38 and the GYF domain of CD2BP2 were found to interact with U5–15K (21Laggerbauer B. Liu S. Makarov E. Vornlocher H.P. Makarova O. Ingelfinger D. Achsel T. Luhrmann R.

Gene. 2000; 257: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although CD2BP2 is not a component of the active spliceosome, it is suggested to be important for the assembly and/or stability of the U5 snRNP prior to the formation of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP (21Laggerbauer B. Liu S. Makarov E. Vornlocher H.P. Makarova O. Ingelfinger D. Achsel T. Luhrmann R. RNA. 2005; 11: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, a possible interaction between NPWBP and CD2BP2 fits well to the functional context of splicing. Future experiments have to define the exact role of CD2BP2 and associated proteins in the maturation of the snRNPs during the spliceosomal assembly process.

The efficacy by which AChE controls neurotransmitter lifetime in the synaptic cleft depends not only on its enzymatic activity but also on its density and location relative to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Although progress has been made in elucidating the cellular and molecular events regulating AChR dynamics at the postsynaptic membrane (3Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 4Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), our knowledge concerning the cellular basis of AChE dynamics is relatively limited. In particular it is unclear how this molecule is inserted and maintained at the synapse in vivo. At the neuromuscular junction, AChE is organized in a tetramer by collagen Q (ColQ) and is tethered in the extracellular matrix via ColQ and a complex of associated proteins, including perlecan, dystroglycan, and a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (5Deprez P.

The availability of fasciculin2, a snake toxin purified from the green mamba (Dendroaspis angusticeps), and the presence of the large number of AChEs at the neuromuscular junction have enabled us to study directly the dynamics of AChE. Fasciculin2 belongs to the three-finger toxin family along with the well known acetylcholine receptor blocker, α-bungarotoxin (11Karlsson E. Mbugua P.M. Rodriguez-Ithurralde D. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1984; 79: 232-240PubMed Google Scholar), and has a high affinity for AChE (12Harel M. Kleywegt G.J. Ravelli R.B. Silman I. Sussman J.L.

Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When fasciculin2 binds AChE, 94% of enzyme activity is inhibited, allowing only residual detectable AChE activity (15Eastman J. Wilson E.J. Cervenansky C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19694-19701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Rosenberry T.L. Rabl C.R. Neumann E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previously, fasciculin2 has been used to characterize AChEs biochemically (11Karlsson E. Mbugua P.M. Rodriguez-Ithurralde D. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1984; 79: 232-240PubMed Google Scholar) as a probe to quantify AChE density in the mouse sternomastoid muscle (17Anglister L. Eichler J. Szabo M. Haesaert B. Salpeter M.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 81: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and fluorescently labeled fasciculin2 has been used to label AChEs on cultured cells, muscle cross-sections, and whole mounted muscle (18Peng H.B. Xie H. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the present work, by saturating all pre-existing AChEs with unlabeled fasciculin2, we were able to monitor the subsequent insertion of new AChEs with fluorescently labeled fasciculin2. We found that AChEs were rapidly inserted into NMJs and that postsynaptic activity is necessary to enable normal AChE insertion through a mechanism mediated by intracellular calcium. Unless stated otherwise, compounds used in this study were obtained from Sigma. Unlabeled fasciculin2 (Latoxan, Valence France) and Alexa 594 fasciculin2 (conjugated by Molecular Probes Eugene, OR) were used to label AChE. Unlabeled and Alexa 488-conjugated bungarotoxin were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). To chelate cytosolic calcium, we used BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a membrane-permeant substance that generates the high affinity calcium chelator BAPTA by the hydrolysis of ester bonds. As a control for any nonspecific effects of the hydrolysis products, we used Mag-Fura2-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which has a much lower affinity for calcium but generates the same by-products. In Vivo Imaging of Neuromuscular Junctions—Non-Swiss Albino adult female mice (6–10 weeks old, 25–30 g) were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley. The mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (17.38 mg/ml). Sternomastoid muscle exposure and neuromuscular junction imaging were done as described in detail previously (19van Mier P. Lichtman J.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lichtman J.W. Magrassi L. Purves D. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Akaaboune M. Culican S.M. Turney S.G. Lichtman J.W. Science. 1999; 286: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, the anesthetized mouse was placed on its back on the stage of a customized epifluorescence microscope, and neuromuscular junctions were viewed under a coverslip with a water immersion objective (×20 UAPO 0.7 NA Olympus BW51, Optical Analysis Corp., Nashua, NH) and digital CCD camera (Retiga EXi, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). All animal usage followed methods approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals. Mice were intubated and ventilated for the duration of the imaging sessions. For experiments in which the junction was to be re-imaged within 8 h, the animal was continuously ventilated and maintained under anesthesia by intraperitoneal doses of ketamine and xylazine every 2 h. To minimize evaporation, the muscle was bathed with lactated Ringer's containing whatever drugs were appropriate to the experiment, and a coverslip was placed over the exposed muscle. A fresh dose of drug solution was added every 2 h. For multiple time points beyond 8 h, the mouse was sutured and allowed to fully recover before the next imaging session. In some experiments, the sternomastoid muscle was stimulated by a Grass SD5 stimulator connected to two platinum wires at either side of the muscle. The stimulus pulses (3-ms bipolar pulses of 6–9 V at 10 Hz for a 1-s duration every 2 s) elicited maximal twitching and therefore action potentials in all muscle fibers. Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging—The fluorescence intensity of labeled AChE at neuromuscular junctions was assayed by using a quantitative fluorescence imaging technique, as described by Turney and colleagues (22Turney S.G. Culican S.M. Lichtman J.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 64: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with minor modification. This technique incorporates compensation for image variation that may be caused by spatial and temporal changes in the light source and camera between imaging sessions by calibrating the images with a nonfading reference standard. Image analysis was performed by using either a procedure written for IPLAB (Scanalytic, VI) or Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA). Background fluorescence was approximated by selecting a boundary region around the junction and subtracting it from the original image, and the mean of the total fluorescence intensity (which corresponds to density) was measured. After saturating all pre-existing AChEs with unlabeled fasciculin2 and re-saturating newly inserted AChEs with fluorescent fasciculin2 at a later time, the mean of the total fluorescence of newly labeled AChE was expressed as the percentage of the mean of fluorescence of AChEs saturated with only Alexa 594 fasciculin2 at time 0. When average intensity is presented, it is ± S.D. The Rate of Fasciculin2 Unbinding from Synapses Is Extremely Slow—The interpretation of the experiments described in this study depends on the rate of unbinding of unlabeled fasciculin2 from AChE. Based on two lines of evidence, we conclude that the rate of unbinding of unlabeled fasciculin2 is slow enough to be considered negligible over the 7-day time span we made the measurements reported in the rest of this study. The first group of experiments was conducted on muscles dissected free of the animal, fixed, and then washed and maintained in 0.5 m glycine PBS (Fig. 1). The advantage of studying fixed tissue is that new synthesis and insertion of AChE are eliminated, so determining the rate of unbinding of fasciculin2 under these conditions is simple. We first demonstrated that neither the ability of Alexa 594-labeled fasciculin2 to interact with AChE nor the ability of Alexa 488-labeled α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX) to interact with AChR was inhibited by four different fixation conditions. In Fig. 1, muscles fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS are shown, but similar results were obtained with 4% PFA, 8% PFA, or 2% PFA and 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS (although in the latter case autofluorescence was extremely high). Muscles fixed, washed, and labeled immediately with Alexa 594-conjugated fasciculin2 (Fig. 1, A and B) and muscles fixed, washed, and then maintained in PBS for as long as 2 months before being exposed to Alexa 594-conjugated fasciculin2 (Fig. 1, C and D) labeled with approximately equal intensity, indicating that fixation does not affect the toxin-binding sites of AChE or AChR. The AChE staining was specific, because it could be prevented by adding saturating levels of unlabeled fasciculin2 or BW284C51 (an inhibitor of AChE that competes with fasciculin2) just prior to adding Alexa 594-conjugated fasciculin2. Binding of Alexa 488 α-BTX was not affected by fasciculin2 (Fig. 1, E–H). The key experiment was to add unlabeled fasciculin2 shortly after washing off the fixative and then probing with Alexa 594-labeled fasciculin2 at a later time. All sites from which the unlabeled fasciculin2 had unbound and washed away should be stained with Alexa 594 fasciculin2. However, even when 2 weeks were allowed for unbinding, there was little or no detectable labeling (Fig. 1J). The dissociation rate we observed for fasciculin2 from AChE at synapses in fixed tissue is far slower than the published unbinding rate of fasciculin2 from solubilized AChE in a test tube, which yields half-lives in the range of a few hours (12Harel M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23265-23277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A potential explanation for the slow apparent rate of unbinding from intact synapses would be that the actual rate of unbinding is much more rapid, but that most of the time the fasciculin2 is rebound rather than diffusing away. To test this possibility, muscles were fixed with 2% PFA, washed, saturated with unlabeled fasciculin2, washed again, and then incubated continuously with a high concentration of Alexa 594 fasciculin2. Under these conditions, it is expected that any fasciculin2 that unbinds will be replaced by Alexa 594 fasciculin2, so the rate of appearance of fluorescence will provide an estimate of the rate of dissociation of unlabeled toxin uncontaminated by rebinding. When we imaged synapses that were continuously incubated in Alexa 594 fasciculin2 for 4 days, we saw little or no evidence for AChEs staining with fluorescent fasciculin2 (Fig. 1L). The second group of experiments tested whether the extremely slow rate of loss of fasciculin2 was a peculiarity of fixed muscle. We placed living mouse diaphragm muscles into organ culture. Synapses were saturated with unlabeled fasciculin2, washed, and then continuously exposed for 24 h to Alexa 488-labeled fasciculin2 in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 2). The rationale for these experiments is that in the absence of cycloheximide, the gain of fluorescence over 24 h might result from three processes as follows: 1) the loss of unlabeled fasciculin2 from pre-existing AChEs followed by rebinding of labeled fasciculin2; 2) the transfer of already synthesized AChEs that were in an intracellular compartment to the cell surface; and 3) the accumulation of newly synthesized AChEs on the surface. Cycloheximide will eliminate or dramatically affect this third possible pathway. In the absence of cycloheximide (Fig. 2, A–C), there was intensive synaptic labeling with Alexa 488-labeled fasciculin2. On average, the intensity was 18% that of control labeled with only Alexa 488-fasciculin2 (that had not been exposed to unlabeled fasciculin2). After 24 h in the presence of cycloheximide, the Alexa 488 fluorescence was barely detectable (Fig. 2, D–I). The average intensity of the Alexa 488 fasciculin2-labeled synapses from cycloheximide-treated muscles was 1–3% of noncycloheximide-treated muscle. If this entire signal was because of fasciculin2 dissociation that followed an exponential time course, this would correspond to a half-life of about 35 days. Because the transfer of pre-existing AChEs to the surface also contributes to this signal, the actual half-life for dissociation is even longer than this. Thus, these experiments were sufficient to conclude that the loss of unlabeled fasciculin2 from AChE in living muscle must be very slow, just as was the case for fixed muscle. AChE Insertion at the Neuromuscular Junction in Living Mice following a Single Saturating Dose of Fasciculin2—To determine the number of new AChEs inserted into the neuromuscular junctions of living animals over time, the sternomastoid muscle of six mice at each data point was bathed with unlabeled fasciculin2 (7 μg/ml, 2.5 h) to saturate all pre-existing AChEs. We confirmed that all AChEs were saturated by adding a fluorescently conjugated Alexa 594 fasciculin2 (7 μg/ml, 10 min) and demonstrating an absence of red fluorescence. Because the rate of unbinding of unlabeled fasciculin2 is undetectably slow (see above), any red fluorescence detected after re-labeling the muscle with Alexa 594 fasciculin2 at a later time must come from the binding of fasciculin2 to newly inserted AChE. The new AChE will include both newly synthesized molecules and AChE that was already present but not on the surface. The number of AChEs inserted after initial saturation of the NMJ with unlabeled fasciculin2 was expressed as a percentage of the fluorescence present when control neuromuscular junctions were saturated with Alexa 594 fasciculin2 and immediately imaged (Fig. 3, A and B). After saturating all pre-existing AChEs with unlabeled fasciculin2 and re-saturating newly inserted AChEs with Alexa 594 fasciculin2 4 h later, we found that the recovery of fluorescence was ∼6 ± 3% (n = 50) of the total fluorescence of AChEs saturated with only Alexa 594 fasciculin2 (Fig. 3, A and B). At 8 and 24 h and 3 and 7 days after saturating all pre-existing AChEs with unlabeled fasciculin2, the recovery of fluorescence intensity was, respectively, 11 ± 3% (n = 40), 20 ± 3% (n = 15), 35 ± 5% (n = 30), and 65 ± 9% (n = 25) of total fluorescence at synapses saturated only with Alexa 594 fasciculin2 (Fig. 3, A and B). This AChE recovery corresponds to an initial rate of about 2% per h (t½ ∼46 h), which slowed by 7 days to 0.7% per h (t½ ∼7 days). Our results showing that AChE insertion is initially rapid differ dramatically from previous reports claiming that the insertion of AChE does not occur until 3–7 days after initial blockade with DFP, an organophosphate esterase inhibitor, and that the rate of insertion is very slow at all times (27Rogers A.W. Darzynkiewicz Z. Salpeter M.M. Ostrowski K. Barnard E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 665-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). AChE Insertion into the Neuromuscular Junction Depends on Muscle Postsynaptic Activity—Because many processes in skeletal muscle are regulated by synaptic activity, we carried out three types of experiments to test the role of activity in regulating the rate of appearance of new AChE. All three approaches used toxins that decrease muscle activity by different mechanisms. α-BTX (10 μg/ml) blocks nAChRs, and so a saturating dose directly eliminates evoked and miniature end plate postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and indirectly eliminates action potentials in the muscle. TTX (1 μg/ml) blocks voltage-gated sodium channels on both axons and on muscle fibers, and so also indirectly blocks evoked EPSPs, while leaving miniature EPSPs intact. μ-Conotoxin GIIIB (2 μm) selectively blocks voltage-gated sodium channels on muscle fibers, while sparing those on axons, leaving neuronal action potentials and both evoked and miniature EPSPs unchanged while blocking muscle action potentials (28Cruz L.J.

The experimental paradigm used to test the effect of exogenous agents on AChE insertion was to apply a saturating dose of unlabeled fasciculin2 (7 μg/ml, 2.5 h) to the sternomastoid muscle followed by a second dose of Alexa 594 fasciculin2 (7 μg/ml, 10–20 min), to be sure that all synapses were saturated with unlabeled fasciculin2, and then to continuously bathe the muscle with a toxin for 8 h (with reapplication every 2 h to make sure that the agent was present continuously). At the end of this period, Alexa 594 fasciculin2 was applied at a saturating dose to label all AChEs that had been inserted over that time. These treatments required that animals be continuously ventilated and could not be carried beyond 8 h because of mortality. The fluorescence of synapses in toxin-treated animals was approximately half the fluorescence of synapses in control animals labeled similarly but not treated with any toxin (α-BTX 46 ± 7% (n = 40); TTX 50 ± 8% (n = 25); and μ-conotoxin GIIIB 46 ± 8% (n = 35); Fig. 4, A–F). Thus new AChE can appear in the absence of spike activity in the muscle at a basal rate, but the rate of AChE appearance was doubled when muscle action potentials were not blocked. Neither presynaptic spikes nor synaptic potentials were able to increase the appearance of new AChE above the basal level if muscle action potentials were absent. Muscle Postsynaptic Activity Restores AChE Insertion—As a final test of the role of muscle spike activity on AChE insertion, the sternomastoid muscle was first bathed with unlabeled fasciculin2 to saturate all pre-existing AChEs, and postsynaptic muscle activity was eliminated by blocking synaptic transmission with a high dose of α-bungarotoxin (10 μg/ml), and then action potentials were directly elicited by placing stimulating electrodes at either end of the muscle (3-ms bipolar pulses of 6–9 V at 10 Hz for 1-s duration every 2 s for the entire 8-h period). During the duration of this experiment, the mouse was intubated and ventilated to prevent asphyxia. We found that the level of expression of AChE in these muscles (112 ± 16%, n = 40) was approximately double the level found in muscles treated with α-BTX alone and was not significantly different from untreated control muscles (Fig. 5, A and B). This result indicates that muscle action potentials are necessary and sufficient to maintain normal levels of AChE insertion. Intracellular Calcium Levels Are Critical for AChE Insertion—Muscle contraction is the consequence of an elevation of intracellular calcium. It therefore seemed possible that the molecular mechanism by which muscle activity modulates AChE insertion also requires an elevation of intracellular calcium. To test this hypothesis, four different types of experiments were carried out. One way for calcium to become elevated is by entering the cell through voltage-activated channels in the plasma membrane. In innervated adult mouse skeletal muscle, only one type of voltage-gated calcium channel (the L-type channel that is slowly activated and inactivated by depolarization and can be blocked by dihydropyridines and verapamil) has been described (29Rotzler S. Schramek H. Brenner H.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30McCleskey E.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 361: 231-249Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Beam K.G.

A. 1986; 83: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine the potential role of Ca2+ flux through this channel on AChE insertion rates, the sternomastoid muscle was incubated with unlabeled fasciculin2 to saturate all pre-existing AChEs and then electrically stimulated in the presence of a high dose of unlabeled bungarotoxin (to block calcium entry through AChRs) and verapamil (50 μm) (to block calcium entry through voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels) for the duration of the experiment. Eight hours later, newly inserted AChEs were labeled with Alexa 594 fasciculin2, and their fluorescence intensity was measured. We found that the fluorescence of newly inserted AChE was only 45 ± 8% (n = 23) of the total fluorescence of control muscle synapses labeled after 8 h with Alexa 594 fasciculin2 (Fig. 6, A and C). However, in unstimulated muscle this drug had little effect on AChE insertion. These results suggest that calcium entry through voltage-dependent calcium channels is involved in AChE insertion. A second mechanism for elevating intracellular free calcium is Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. To investigate whether the release of intracellular calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the absence of muscle activity can modulate AChE insertion, muscle postsynaptic activity was chronically blocked with unlabeled α-BTX in the presence of ryanodine, a plant alkaloid known to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (33Fairhurst A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1974; 227: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Fairhurst A.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 2815-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 35Jenden D.J. Fairhurst A.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1969; 21: 1-25PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with 0.3 μm ryanodine, a concentration known to tonically elevate intracellular free calcium (36Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6300-6306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in AChE insertion levels comparable with those of control muscles (115 ± 18%, n = 38) and double those in muscles treated with α-BTX alone, indicating that directly releasing calcium from intracellular stores can bypass the need for spike activity to elevate AChE insertion (Fig. 6, B and C). Verapamil was unable to inhibit the effect of 0.3 μm ryanodine, arguing that the calcium flux through L-type channels is not required to replenish the intracellular calcium stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, treatment with 100 μm ryanodine, which transiently elevates intracellular free calcium but then leaves the stores depleted for many hours (36Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6300-6306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in only basal levels of AChE insertion or Ca2+ concentration (data not shown). A third test of the involvement of intracellular free calcium in AChE insertion was to bypass all normal cellular pathways and to elevate intracellular free calcium directly by adding the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (3 μm). Treatment of α-BTX-blocked muscles with A23187 elicited an increase in the expression of AChE to about double the base-line value (100 ± 7%, n = 25) (Fig. 6, D and F), as would be expected if a rise in intracellular free calcium plays a role in AChE insertion. Finally, we examined the effect of adding an exogenous calcium buffer into the muscle cells, with the expectation that this might attenuate the spike-induced increase in intracellular free calcium. Chronic exposure to BAPTA-AM (500 μm) for 8 h decreased the level of AChE insertion to 17 ± 5% (n = 20) (Fig. 6, E and F) of control fluorescence, significantly below the basal level of about 50% seen in all other treatments that blocked activity. This effect was specific, as the treatment with Mag-Fura2-AM, which would produce the same waste product as BAPTA-AM but has a much lower affinity for calcium than BAPTA and thus should be incapable of chelating physiological levels of calcium, had no effect on AChE insertion.

A promotion effect by applying exogenous purified calmodulin and an inhibition effect by the addition of anti-calmodulin anti-serum or calmodulin antagonist to the medium on proliferation of suspension cells were found by monitoring incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into nuclear DNA. Radioligand binding analysis with 35S-labeled calmodulin indicated the presence of specific, reversible, and saturable calmodulin binding sites on the surface of both A. thaliana suspension-cultured cells and its protoplasts; among them at least one is on the surface of Arabidopsis protoplasts, with the Kd ∼9.2 nm, and two are on the out-surface of Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, with Kd values of ∼47.5 and 830 nm. Chemical crosslinking of 35S-labeled calmodulin to protoplasts revealed 117- and 41-kDa plasma membrane proteins specifically bound to calmodulin, whereas cross-linking with intact suspension-cultured cells verified more calmodulin binding proteins which might be cell wall-associated in addition to membrane-localized. Taking together, our data provide first evidence for the presence of apoplastic calmodulin receptor-like binding proteins on the cell surface of Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, which strongly supports our previous idea that apoplastic calmodulin functions as a peptide signal involved in regulation of cell growth and development.

Because the first peptide hormone, insulin, was found in 1922 (1Banting F.G. Best C.H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1922; 7: 251-256Google Scholar), hundreds of peptide hormones and their specific receptors have been verified to play important roles in animal cell communications, whereas few were found in the plant cells until last decade, when plant biologists realized that “plant cells, like animal, may make use of peptide signals” (2Marx J. Science. 1996; 237: 1338-1339Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). From then on about 10 polypeptide hormones or putative polypeptide signals have been reported in plants (3Ma L.G. Sun D.Y. Chin.

J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3863-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence, however, mined out hundreds of candidate genes which more likely encode orphan receptors and orphan apoplastic polypeptides (7The Arabidopsis Genome InitiativeNature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7211) Google Scholar). Confirmation of existence of plasma membrane receptors and their polypeptide ligands experimentally become significant and important for our understanding the molecular mechanism by which plant polypeptide hormone functions in regulation of plant physiology and development.

Based on all the data, we proposed that extracellular CaM might act as a polypeptide signal (10Sun D.Y. Tang J. Li H.B. Chin. Sci.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1351-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the receptor on the cell surface of apoplast CaM has not yet been identified and has become the bottleneck of this hypothesis. In this study we first confirmed the existence of CaM in the cell wall and culture medium of Arabidopsis suspension cells by immunoblotting assay of different cell fractions and the functions of CaM in stimulating proliferation of suspension-cultured cells. Then we analyzed the binding kinetics, reversibility, specificity, and saturation of 35S-ACaM2 (Arabidopsis calmodulin isoform 2) on Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells and protoplasts. Finally we found candidate apoplastic CaM receptor-like binding proteins on the cell surface by chemical cross-linking of 35S-ACaM2 with protoplasts and suspensioncultured cells. Callus and Cell Suspension Cultures—Arabidopsis Columbia (Col-0) seeds were surface-sterilized and grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid medium supplemented with 1 mg/liter (2,4-dicholophenoxyacetic acid), 0.5 mg/liter 6-benzyladenine, 3% sucrose, and 0.6% agar, pH 5.7, for 2 weeks in the dark at 25 °C. The callus was collected from germinating seeds and transferred to fresh MS solid medium the same as above except for decreasing 6-benzyladenine to 0.1 mg/liter. After 3–4 such transfers, the callus became soft and pale yellow, and approximately 3 g of callus was transferred to 100 ml of MS liquid medium supplemented with 1 mg/liter 2,4-dicholophenoxyacetic acid, 0.1 mg/liter 6-benzyladenine, and 3% sucrose, pH 5.7, and agitated at 120 rpm at 25 °C. Cells were subcultured every 7days. Suspension-cultured cells of 3–5 days subculture were filtered through 50-μm stainless steel meshes to remove large cell clusters. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g then resuspended and incubated in EGTA washing buffer (5 mm Mes-KOH, pH 5.7, 1 mm EGTA, 3% sucrose) for 15 min. Cells were collected and washed twice with binding buffer (5 mm Mes-KOH, pH 5.7, 1 mm CaCl2, 3% sucrose). The final cell density was adjusted with binding assay buffer to 106-107 cells/ml for 35S-ACaM2 binding assay and chemical cross-linking. Preparation of Protoplasts—About 2 g of callus was incubated with 20 ml of enzyme solution (1% cellulase, 0.3% macerozyme in digestion buffer containing 5 mm Mes-KOH, pH 5.6, 0.5 m mannitol, 1mm CaCl2) with shaking at 50 rpm at 25 °C for 4 h in the dark. The digestion solution was filtered through 50-μm sieves, and the protoplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 20 °C followed by 2 washes with digestion buffer then suspended in digestion buffer at a density of 106-107 protoplasts/ml for 35S-ACaM2 binding assay and cross-linking. Extraction of Extracellular Proteins and Immunoblot Analysis—Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells subcultured 7 days were separated from cultured medium by centrifuging at 500 × g, then washed twice with double distilled H2O. The cell wall proteins were extracted by the method of Tang et al. (22Tang J. Wu S.P. Bai J. Sun D.Y. Planta. 1996; 198: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated in 0.1 m CaCl2 at 4 °C for 20 min. The resulting salt-extracted solution was first passed through 5-μm qualitative filter paper followed by a 0.25-μm microporous filter membrane to remove cell debris and then precipitated with 80% (v/v) acetone. The cultured medium was also passed through the filter paper and membrane successively as described previously, then directly precipitated with 80% acetone. Whole cell proteins were also extracted as the control. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was detected by method of Edward and John (24Edward E.F. John S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was probed with anti-CaM polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution) raised against recombinant ACaM2 in rabbit or with anti-α-tubulin polyclonal antibody (Sigma) (1:1000 dilution). Alkaline phosphatase conjugate secondary antibody (Sigma) was used to develop the blot. Preparation of Recombinant CaM and 35S-ACaM2—Recombinant CaM was prepared as described by Zielinski (25Zielinski R.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 172: 1-7Google Scholar), and 35S-ACaM2 was labeled as described by Cui et al. (26Cui S.J. Guo X.Q. Mao G.H. Zhao J.F. Sun Y. Bai J. Ma L.G. Sun D.Y. Prog. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 29: 801-805Google Scholar). Measurement of Suspension-cultured Cell Proliferation Rate—Cell proliferation rate was measured as described by Li et al. (15Li J.X. Liu J.W. Sun D.Y. Cell Res. 1993; 3: 11-19Crossref Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, 1 ml of suspension cell pretreated with CaM, anti-CaM antibody, and CaM antagonist and W-7-agarose (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloronaphthalenesulfonamide hydrochloride conjugated to agarose, Sigma) was incubated with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Bioscience) for 12 h. The cells were then transferred onto glass filters (Millipore, APFA02500), washed with 20 ml of 0.9% NaCl, dehydrated with 10 ml of 95% ethanol, and fixed with 10 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid. The filters were dried at 80 °C for 30 min, and the radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation analyzer. The Excel program was used to process the data. Binding of 35S-ACaM2 to Arabidopsis Protoplasts and Suspension-cultured Cells—In the standard assay 0.5 ml of protoplasts (106/ml) or suspension-cultured cells (106/ml) were transferred to 24-well culture plates and incubated on a shaker (150 rpm) at room temperature or 4 °C. Binding was initiated by adding 35S-ACaM2 in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 200-fold unlabeled ACaM2 if not indicated. In competition assays the competitor was added just before 35S-ACaM2. Incubations were for 30 min, except when measuring the time course or reversibility of binding. After incubation, the reaction mixture was filtered through a glass fiber prefilters (GF/C, Millipore). Protoplasts or cells were washed with 10 ml of 4 °C binding buffer within about 20 s. The 35S-ACaM2 bound to the protoplast- or cell-retained filters was analyzed with liquid scintillation analyzer at 95% efficiency. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Data were analyzed with Graphpad Prism 4.0. Chemical Cross-linking of 35S-ACaM2 to Extracellular Binding Sites—800 μl of protoplasts or cells at a density of 107/ml were transferred to 2 ml of siliconized Eppendorf tubes that contained 100 μl of digestion buffer or binding buffer with 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm EGTA, or 200 μm trifluoperazine for each. 35S-ACaM2 was then added to each tube to a final concentration of 10–7 m. After a 30-min reaction, the cross-linking reagent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) or sulfo-EGS (Pierce) was directly added to each tube with a final concentration of 1 mm. The cross-linking was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 4 °C. The unbound and non-cross-linked 35S-ACaM2 was removed by washing twice with digestion buffer or binding buffer, the cross-linked cell or protoplast pellet was lysed in 100 μlof1× Laemmli sample buffer (24Edward E.F. John S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), boiled for 15 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were then dried and exposed to a storage phosphor screen for 12 h. Images were scanned and analyzed by Typhoon 9210 imager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting Identification of Apoplast CaM in Arabidopsis Suspension-cultured Cells—To demonstrate the presence of extracellular CaM in the system of Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, we extracted proteins from the cell wall (Fig. 1, lanes 3, 6, and 9), cultured medium (Fig. 1, lanes 4, 7, and 10), and whole cell (Fig. 1, lanes 2, 5, and 8) and probed each fraction for CaM with anti-CaM polyclonal antibody by immunoblotting (Fig. 1, lanes 5–7). Anti-tubulin antibody was also used to detect tubulin, which could be used as an intracellular protein indicator (Fig. 1, lanes 8–10). Amino black staining of the blot (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4) showed a loading reference for each fraction that has the same amount of proteins (about 15 μg of total proteins per lane) but different protein patterns one from the other in SDS-PAGE. A specific 16-kDa band corresponding to the CaM molecular mass was recognized by anti-CaM antibody in all three fractions (Fig. 1, lanes 5–7), whereas 43-kDa tubulin was only detectable in whole cell fractions (Fig. 1, lane 8). These results demonstrated the presence of extracellular CaM in Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, which was either bound to the cell wall or secreted into the medium, but not contaminated by intracellular CaM from leaky cells generated in the process of protein sample preparation.Fig. 2Effect of apoplast CaM on proliferation of Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells. To test the effect of endogenous CaM on cell proliferation, 1 ml of Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells subcultured 7 days were treated with different concentrations of anti-CaM antiserum (A) and W-7-agarose (B) for 24 h, then incubated with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine for another 12 h. The radioactivity of each sample was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To test the effect of exogenous CaM on cell proliferation, 1 ml of subcultured cells was pretreated either with 5 μm W-7-agarose for 2 h (C) or 1 mm EGTA in MS medium for 15 min (D) to remove endogenous apoplast CaM, then incubated with concentrations of CaM for 24 h followed with [methyl-3H]thymidine and quantified for radioactivity in the same way as A and B. Error bars indicated the S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Effect of Apoplast CaM on Proliferation of Arabidopsis Suspension-cultured Cells—To determine the functions of apoplast CaM in Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, we investigated cell mitogenic activities before and after the addition of effectors or reagents as indicated in Fig. 2 by monitoring incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into nuclear DNA. Anti-CaM antiserum was first used to detect endogenous apoplast CaM function in cell proliferation. We found that radioactivity of 3H labeling was substantially decreased with the increase of anti-serum concentration, i.e. 50% decrease by 100 μg/ml and 82% decrease by 200 μg/ml, respectively, whereas pre-immune serum has little depression effect (Fig. 2A). Similarly, W7-agarose, another membrane-impermeable antagonist specific for CaM, also inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration for 50% inhibition, IC50, was 5 m, and for 100% inhibition it was 100 nm (Fig. 2B). Based on this, we pretreated suspension cells with 5 μm W7-agarose for 2 h to inhibit endogenous apoplastic CaM, then added a series of concentrations of recombination purified ACaM2 to the medium as indicated in Fig. 2C. We found that the inhibition of cell mitogenic activities by W7-agarose was gradually recovered as CaM, increasing to 10–6 m, at which cell proliferation CaM was almost totally restored (Fig. 2D). These results implied that endogenous apoplast CaM is an important factor necessary for suspension cell proliferation. To further verify this idea we tested the effect of exogenous purified CaM on cell proliferation. We first washed suspension cells with 1 mm EGTA in MS medium followed with fresh MS medium to remove endogenous apoplast CaM. We then applied a series of concentration of purified recombinant ACaM2 to the suspension culture. An increase in 3H radioactivity was observed and was determined to be concentration-dependent. The optimal CaM concentration is 10–7 m, at which 3H radioactivity was increased by more than 1-fold when compared with 10–7 m BSA treatment (Fig. 2D). These results indicated that exogenous CaM functions in the same way as endogenous CaM and supported the idea that apoplast CaM plays a very important role in suspension cell proliferation. Binding Kinetics of 35S-ACaM2 to Arabidopsis Protoplasts and Cells—Radioligand binding assays at cell level provide important information about apoplast CaM binding sites. In the initial experiments, simple separation of bound 35S-ACaM2 from free 35S-ACaM2 by quick centrifugation followed by a rapid rinse gave us an unacceptable high background. Filtering cells through a GF/C membrane and washing the membrane quickly reduced both background and variation, and this method was used for subsequent binding assays. To block nonspecific binding of radioligand to glass filters, protoplasts, or cells, we preincubated glass filters with 1% BSA for 1 h and protoplasts and cells with 0.1% BSA in binding assay buffer for 0.5 h before adding 35S-ACaM2. Unless otherwise noted all the experiments were done in this way. The time course binding was performed first. The binding of 40 nm35S-ACaM2 to protoplasts (Fig. 3A) or to intact cells (Fig. 3B) reached the top in 10 min and remained relatively constant for next 10–40 min. The observed rate constant, kob, was determined by using the one-phase exponential association program of GraphPad Prism. The kob of 35S-ACaM2 binding to protoplasts was 0.45/min (Fig. 3A) and to intact cells was 0.21/min (Fig. 3B) at room temperature. t½, the time needed for half-maximum binding of 35S-ACaM2 to protoplasts, was 1.53 min (Fig. 3A) and to intact cells was 3.3 min (Fig. 3B). Reverse binding was tested by adding an excess of unlabeled CaM to the reactions after 30 min of 35S-ACaM2 binding to protoplasts (Fig. 3C) or cells (Fig. 3D). At each time point indicated, the reactions were stopped by quickly filtering protoplasts and cells onto the glass filter, and the binding of 35S-ACaM2 was determined. As time progressed, we found that binding was gradually reversed, and within 10 min for protoplasts (Fig. 3C) or 30 min for cells (Fig. 3D), the binding was almost back to the nonspecific binding level. The dissociation rate constant, Koff, which indicates the separation rate of the ligand from the receptor complex, and t½, the time needed for dissociation of half-bound 35S-ACaM2, were determined using the one-phase exponential decay program. The Koff and t½ values were 0.48/min and 2.48 min from protoplasts (Fig. 3C), and 0.31/min and 2.22 min from intact cells (Fig. 3D), respectively. Binding Specificity of 35S-ACaM2 to Arabidopsis Protoplasts and Cells—Homologous and heterologous competitive binding assays were performed to test 35S-ACaM2 binding specificity. In homologous competitive experiments, a series of concentrations of unlabeled ACaM2 were used as competitors of 10 nm 35S-ACaM2 for binding to protoplasts or suspension-cultured cells. Competition happened only when the competitor was more than 10–9 m for binding to protoplasts (Fig. 4A) or 10–8 m for binding to intact cells (Fig. 4B). When more than 10–6 m (for protoplast) or 10–5 m (for intact cells) unlabeled ACaM2 was used, the 35S-ACaM2 binding was reduced almost equal to the level of nonspecific binding. In heterologous protein competitive experiments, increasing amounts of S-100 (Ca2+-binding protein from bovine brain with two EF-hand domains), BSA, rabbit IgG fragment, or unlabeled ACaM2 as a control were used as competitors of 35S-ACaM2 for binding to protoplasts (Fig. 4C). Neither BSA nor IgG competed with 35S-ACaM2 for binding to protoplasts. S-100 was able to decrease 35S-ACaM2 binding by 20% at each molar ratio; it is probably a nonspecific competition binding to protoplasts as compared with specific binding of ACaM2, which effectively decreased the 35S-ACaM2 binding to protoplasts (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the binding sites on intact cells are CaM isoform-specific, a different source of CaM, including soybean CaM isoform 1 and 5 (SCaM1,5) and ACaM2 and S-100, a calcium-binding protein with EF domain, each at 200× molar ratios, was used to compete with 35S-ACaM2 for binding to intact cells. Approximately 70–80% 35S-ACaM2 total binding, or almost all of the specific binding, was competed by ACaM2 or SCaM1, whereas the same amount of SCaM5 or S-100 competed only 20–25% 35S-ACaM2 total binding to the cells (Fig. 4D). Binding Saturation of 35S-ACaM2 to Arabidopsis Protoplasts and Cells—Binding saturation is the minimal significant requirement for ligand binding to a receptor. To examine this, protoplasts or cells were incubated with various concentrations of 35S-ACaM2, and the bound radioactivity was determined after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 5, A and B). The data analyzed showed that on the surface of Arabidopsis protoplasts there is one kind of binding site with a Kd of ∼9.2 nm and nearly 25,000 sites per protoplast (Fig. 5A), whereas on the surface of Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells there are at least two kinds of binding sites; one is high affinity with Kd1 of ∼47.5 nm, about 31,000 sites per cell, another is low affinity with a Kd2 of 830 nm, 280,000 sites per cell (Fig. 5B). Characterization of the Protein Nature of Apoplast CaM Binding Sites—To assess the nature of CaM binding sites, we treated protoplasts (Fig. 6A) and suspension-cultured cells (Fig. 6B) with proteinase E and then analyzed the 35S-ACaM2 binding sites. Treatment with proteinase E had no visible effect on the intactness of protoplasts and cells as revealed by fluorescein diacetate staining (date not shown), but specific binding sites of 35S-ACaM2 on the surface of both protoplasts and cells were greatly abolished. One mg/ml proteinase E treatment abolished more than 90% specific binding of 35S-ACaM2 to protoplasts (Fig. 6A), whereas10 mg/ml proteinase E was needed to abolish the same percentage of specific binding as that in suspension cells (Fig. 6B). These results indicated that most of the apoplast CaM binding sites on the surface of cells and protoplasts are sensitive to proteinase, and there are more binding sites on the intact cell surface than that on the protoplast surface. Identification of the Possible Apoplast CaM Binding Proteins on the Surface of Protoplast and Cell—To further characterize the cell-surface CaM-binding proteins, we first chemically cross-linked the protoplast surface with 100 nm35S-ACaM2, then separated total proteins by 7% SDS-PAGE and analyzed protein bands with phosphorimaging. Two cross-linked complex bands with molecular masses about 130 and 58 kDa each were detected (Fig. 7A, lane 1). Both disappeared when a 200× excess of unlabeled ACaM2 and 1 mm Ca2+ were present in the cross-linking reaction (Fig. 7A, lane 2). Intact cells were also chemically cross-linked with 35S-ACaM2 in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, and total proteins were separated and analyzed as above. About 7 bands, with molecular masses approximately 180, 130, 96, 84, 65, 58, and 50 kDa were detected (Fig. 7B, lane 1). When a 100× (Fig. 7, lane 2) or 200× (Fig. 7, lane 3) excess of unlabeled ACaM2 was present the cross-linked complexes of 180, 130, and 58 kDa disappeared. When cross-linking was done in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 7B, lane 4), 2 mm EGTA (Fig. 7B, lane 5), or 200 μm CaM antagonist trifluoperazine (Fig. 7B, lane 6), the 96-, 84-, and 50-kDa bands were still detectable, whereas the 180-, 130-, and 58-kDa bands almost disappeared.
