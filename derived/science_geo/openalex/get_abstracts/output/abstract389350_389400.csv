https://openalex.org/W1976395085,"BEFORE and during the War, investigations were reported on the viscosity of anisotropic liquids1,2,3,4. As is well known, the flow of an anisotropic liquid influences the orientation of the molecules. On the other hand, the value of the viscosity coefficient depends on this orientation. Therefore this coefficient is a function of the velocity-gradient, and the usual definition of the viscosity coefficient for these liquids loses its significance. If under the influence of any factor the molecules of the liquid should be orientated in one direction and the motion is unable to change this orientation, then we have the viscosity coefficient in the ordinary sense. But in this case we have to deal with the anisotropy of the viscosity, and in case of a liquid of the type of p-azoxyanisol we have three principal viscosity coefficients belonging to the three directions of orientation ; these are : (1) direction of the flow ; (2) direction of the velocity gradient ; (3) perpendicular to both these directions. Having given the molecules an orientation by means of a magnetic field in such circumstances that the flow did not change this orientation, I obtained the following values for the three principal viscosity coefficients for p-azoxyanisol and p-azoxyphenetol2."

https://openalex.org/W1999458134,"WHILE studying the effect of high-dosage vitamin E (a-tocopherol acetate) on purpura1, the good influence of this factor upon coronary heart disease became apparent. A study of a series of cardiac patients, carried out with the help of Mr. Floyd Skelton and Dr. Wilfrid Shute, has suggested: (a) vitamin E in large dosage (200–600 mgm. Ephynal–Hoffmann–LaRoche) has no apparent effect upon normal hearts, even after administration for many months on end ; (b) its effect upon patients having congestive heart disease and the anginal syndrome is marked ; it increases exercise tolerance and diminishes or abolishes anginal pain during the period of its administration ; its diuretic effect2 is pronounced."

https://openalex.org/W2089268961,"IT has been suggested by Slade1 that the physiological activity of y-hexachlorocyclohexane, the active constituent of the insecticide 'Gammexane', is due to its antagonism towards the essential metabolite i-inositol, which is considered to have the same spatial configuration. Kirkwood and Phillips2 have recently shown that for the Gebrüer Mayer strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiæ this is in fact the case, since the y-isomer has a marked inhibitory effect on the growth of the organism, and the inhibition is overcome by the addition of more i-inositol to the medium. The other three isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane are but slightly inhibitory, and excess i-inositol is without effect."

https://openalex.org/W2057537535,"IN a communication in Nature, Mr. H. Wolfson1 reported that iron can be determined satisfactorily on the polarograph if the solution contains triethanolamine. This method seemed promising for the measurement of iron in small quantities, which has hitherto been practically impossible. It would be particularly suitable for use on biological materials and foodstuffs, especially if lead and copper could be measured in the same solution. In Mr. Wolfson's solutions, containing ammonia, copper gives two steps, the second one interfering with that of ferric iron. He stated, however, that the properties of the solution can be considerably modified by the presence of a strong alkali. When this suggestion was followed up, it was found that the steps for copper, lead and iron can be separated and that the three metals can be determined simultaneously under suitable conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2060417683,"IN 1938, Levine and Katzin1 described a phenomenon in which the red blood cells of a patient suffering from a severe infection with pneumococcus Type 1 were agglutinated by the sera of about 15 per cent of normal persons. The agglutination occurred at room and lower temperatures but not at 37°C. The authors considered that a latent agglutinogen in the cells was activated by some unidentified mechanism and that this agglutinogen was rendered susceptible to the action of agglutinins which were normally present in the sera. This property of the red cells lasted only for four months. Gaffney and Sachs2 have described a similar occurrence in two subjects. The first, a boy aged 11 years, had been treated for congenital syphilis for four years. His red cells were agglutinated at room temperature but not at 37°C. Of the sera used the percentage which produced agglutination varied at different times, 89 per cent being the highest. The second was a healthy woman student whose cells were agglutinated at room temperature by 73 per cent of the sera against which they were tested. The poly-agglutinability, as the authors term the phenomenon, disappeared in both patients after some months."

https://openalex.org/W2073482045,"McCance and Widdowson1 have shown that intravenous injection of BAL-Intrav (dithiogiycerol glucoside) increased greatly the urinary excretion of copper in man. In view of the importance of naturally occurring diseases in sheep associated with either a deficiency of copper (for example, enzootic ataxia2 or 'swayback' of lambs) or an excessive storage of copper (for example, toxmic jaundice3), preliminary trials were made to ascertain whether, in sheep, BAL-Intrav would similarly influence the excretion of copper. It was felt that the experimental use of this substance and of related compounds might prove of value in the elucidation of some of the unsolved problems associated with the copper metabolism of the sheep."

Barron and Matthews1 showed that polarization of the central part of the motor neurons evoked rhythmical responses when the cathode was placed on the cord and the anode on the root, whereas regular responses were only occasionally obtained if the current was reversed."

https://openalex.org/W2032622027,"WHILE keeping cultures of Hydra vulgaris Pallas for class work it was noticed that whereas adult animals seldom changed their position, buds immediately after their separation from the parent rapidly made their way up the side of the tank to the surface of the water. This reaction seemed worthy of further investigation, since previous workers on the behaviour of Hydra have not made any distinction between adults and buds. Upward movement has generally been regarded as a response to lack of oxygen or to a gradient in oxygen concentration, rather than as a gravity reaction1,2,3. I have found that the upward migration of recently separated buds is a response to gravity and not to lack of oxygen, or to a gradient of oxygen concentration : It takes place both when the water is at air saturation and there is no gradient of oxygen concentration, and also when the oxygen concentration is arranged to be lowest at the top and highest at the bottom of the vessel containing the animals."

In respect of apples they pointed out that in the presence of catechol or of apple juice, the phenolases of apple oxidized ascorbic acid indirectly, but that ascorbic acid oxidase activity could not be demonstrated in the absence of phenolase activity, either in crude juice, filtered juice, or tissue extract."
https://openalex.org/W1967412350,"STATISTICS of wars have been collected from the whole world for the 120 years beginning with A.D. 1820. Attention was directed to the number of nations, or other large belligerent groups, on each side of any war. Accordingly, wars were classified as 1 group versus 1 group, or as 2 versus 1, or as 2 versus 2, and in general as r versus s. The number of wars of each of these types was counted. The result was a fairly regular statistical distribution, having a peculiar shape. Among a total of 91 wars there were 42 of the type ‘1 versus 1’, 24 of the type ‘2 versus 1’, and not more than five wars of any one more complicated type. The simplest type of encounter was the most frequent."
https://openalex.org/W2031235383,"SUBMARGINAL banding of various bacteria and protozoa in the covered mounted drop of culture is familiar. It is due to the organisms seeking the zone of optimum oxygen tension. Certain bacteria and some flagellate and ciliate protozoa, also a nematode worm, retire to the cleft below a glass slip placed on the floor of a suitable culture and form bands or other characteristic aggregations. This centripetal movement has appeared in Petri dishes of clear hay and linseed cultures of mixed sewage-filter organisms. With certain species of ciliates the bands persist for some thirty to fifty days, and the organisms remain abundant in the clefts after they have become very scanty in the open culture."

Unless it is to be applied to every field containing wireworms (this would mean most of the cultivated land in Britain) it will be necessary to be able to predict in advance which fields are likely to be attacked. I am convinced, as a result of experiences as a member of the wireworm advisory team stationed at Cambridge during the War, that such predictions are more difficult to make than is commonly believed. The assumption that wireworm damage increases with rising population must be used with reservation in making such predictions."

One of the 'phosphates' of the adenosine triphosphate is hydrolysed off easily (in 7 min. at 100° in normal hydrochloric acid), while the other is stable (N/P, 1.13 ; number of acid-equivalents, 3). If one 'phosphate' is split off, one additional acid-equivalent is formed. The NH2 group can be liberated by desamidase or nitrogen dioxide."
