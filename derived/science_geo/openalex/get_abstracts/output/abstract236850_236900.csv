https://openalex.org/W1970633222,"The lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus is widely used for the manufacture of yogurt and cheese. This dairy species of major economic importance is phylogenetically close to pathogenic streptococci, raising the possibility that it has a potential for virulence. Here we report the genome sequences of two yogurt strains of S. thermophilus. We found a striking level of gene decay (10% pseudogenes) in both microorganisms. Many genes involved in carbon utilization are nonfunctional, in line with the paucity of carbon sources in milk. Notably, most streptococcal virulence-related genes that are not involved in basic cellular processes are either inactivated or absent in the dairy streptococcus. Adaptation to the constant milk environment appears to have resulted in the stabilization of the genome structure. We conclude that S. thermophilus has evolved mainly through loss-of-function events that remarkably mirror the environment of the dairy niche resulting in a severely diminished pathogenic potential."

Here, we show that they can be exploited by parasites for survival in their insect hosts. PpGalec, a tandem repeat galectin expressed in the midgut of the sandfly Phlebotomus papatasi, is used by Leishmania major as a receptor for mediating specific binding to the insect midgut, an event crucial for parasite survival, and accounts for species-specific vector competence for the most widely distributed form of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Old World. In addition, these studies demonstrate the feasibility of using midgut receptors for parasite ligands as target antigens for transmission-blocking vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W1986854615,"Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is a serine/threonine protein kinase with antiapoptotic activities; also, it is a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Here we show that Akt1/Akt2 play a critical role in osteoclast differentiation but not cell survival and that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, are required for cell survival in isolated osteoclast precursors. To investigate the function of Akt1, Akt2, mTOR, and Bim, we employed a retroviral system for delivery of small interfering RNA into cells. Loss of Akt1 and/or Akt2 protein inhibited osteoclast differentiation due to down-regulation of IκB-kinase (IKK) α/β activity, phosphorylation of IκB-α, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) p50, and NFκB p50 DNA-binding activity. Surprisingly, deletion of Akt1 and/or Akt2 protein did not stimulate cleaved caspase-3 activity and failed to promote apoptosis. Conversely, loss of mTOR protein induced apoptosis due to up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3 activity. In addition, we found that mTOR is downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (but not Akt) and that macrophage colony-stimulating factor regulates Bim expression through mTOR activation for cell survival. These results demonstrate that Akt1/Akt2 are key elements in osteoclast differentiation and that the macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulation of mTOR leading to Bim inhibition is essential for cell survival in isolated osteoclast precursors. Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is a serine/threonine protein kinase with antiapoptotic activities; also, it is a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

These results demonstrate that Akt1/Akt2 are key elements in osteoclast differentiation and that the macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulation of mTOR leading to Bim inhibition is essential for cell survival in isolated osteoclast precursors. Akt is a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IKK, IκB kinase; DKO, double knock-out; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; RANKL, receptor activator of NFκB ligand; BMM, bone marrow macrophages; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IKK, IκB kinase; DKO, double knock-out; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; RANKL, receptor activator of NFκB ligand; BMM, bone marrow macrophages; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. and has been shown to be a critical mediator of cell proliferation and survival in a variety of cell types (1Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). There are three Akt genes, which yield Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 (2Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3718) Google Scholar). All three gene products are similar in structure and size, contain an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain and seem to be regulated by similar mechanisms (2Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3718) Google Scholar). Akt1 is the most ubiquitously expressed isoform in mammalian cells and tissues (2Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3718) Google Scholar). Akt2 is also expressed in most tissues and organs, usually at levels lower than Akt1 (2Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3718) Google Scholar). Akt3 is expressed at the lowest level in most adult tissues, except testes and brain (2Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3718) Google Scholar). Recently, Akt has been implicated in cell differentiation (3Kaneko S. Feldman R.I. Yu L. Wu Z. Gritsko T. Shelley S.A.

Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). For example, several studies have reported that both mRNA and protein levels of endogenous Akt1 are not changed, whereas Akt2 is elevated during muscle differentiation, suggesting that Akt2, but not Akt1, plays an important role of myogenesis (3Kaneko S. Feldman R.I. Yu L. Wu Z. Gritsko T. Shelley S.A. Nicosia S.V. Nobori T. Cheng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, Akt enhances MyoD transactivation, and MyoD promotes Akt expression during muscle differentiation (3Kaneko S. Feldman R.I. Yu L. Wu Z. Gritsko T. Shelley S.A.

Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that adipocyte differentiation is blocked in Akt1/Akt2 double knock-out (DKO) mice, and Akt is required for the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression (the master regulator of adipogenesis) during adipocyte differentiation. Akt1/Akt2 DKO mice also displayed delayed bone development (5Peng X-d. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). However, the function of Akt1/Akt2 during osteoclastogenesis is largely unknown. NFκB is an essential transcription factor for osteoclast differentiation because there are no osteoclasts in NFκB p50/p52 DKO (6Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that NFκB is a target of Akt (7Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar, 8Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Moreover, IκB kinase α (IKKα), which is upstream of NFκB, has an Akt phosphorylation site (7Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized Akt regulates osteoclast differentiation and cell survival in isolated osteoclast precursors. To investigate our postulate, we employed a retroviral system for delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells, and found that Akt1/Akt2 play a critical role of osteoclast differentiation but not cell survival. Furthermore, the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-stimulated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/Bim signal is required for cell survival in osteoclast precursors.

Technology. Polyclonal anti-NFκB p50 and polyclonal anti-β-actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Recombinant mouse M-CSF was purchased from R&D Systems. Glutathione S-transferase receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) was a gift from Dr. Meenakshi Chellaiah (Department of Oral and Craniofacial Biology, University of Maryland). Constructs—The mouse Akt1 and Akt2 siRNA target sequences have been published previously (9Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Coleman K.A. Chouinard M. Boese Q. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 56-mer sense and antisense strands of DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Construction of a retroviral vector for delivery of siRNA and generation of virus were performed using the GeneSuppressor retroviral system (Imgenex) according to the manufacturer's suggestions.Table IMouse siRNA targeted sequencessiRNA duplexTargeted regionSequencesScrambleNone5′-GCG CGC UUU GUA GGA UUC G-3′Akt11334-13545′-CCA GGA CCA CGA GAA GCU G-3′ (8Romashkova J.A.

After 24 h in culture, the non-adherent cells were collected and layered on Histopaque gradient (Sigma), and the cells at the gradient interface were collected. The cells were replated (60-mm dish) in α minimum Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biocell Laboratories) in the presence of M-CSF (100 ng/ml). After 3 days in culture, the cells were infected with siRNA retrovirus for 24 h in the presence of 100 ng/ml M-CSF and 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Infected cells were cultured for an additional 2–3 days, and the cells were harvested for assay. Further, for in vitro differentiation, 3.2 × 104 cells/well were plated in 24-well plates in the presence of RANKL (100 ng/ml) and M-CSF (20 ng/ml). After 4 days, the cells were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity (Sigma). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells containing more than three nuclei were counted as osteoclasts under microscopic examination. Western Blotting—For LY294002 (50 μm), rapamycin (1 nm), RANKL (100 ng/ml), and/or M-CSF (20 ng/ml) stimulation experiments, infected cells were treated with these inhibitors and cytokines. To visualize phosphorylated and total Akt, mTOR, IKK1/2, and IκB-α, total Akt1, Akt2, NFκB p50, and Bim, the cells were then washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a cell lysis buffer (New England Biolabs) to prepare whole-cell lysates, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. For the detection of NFκB p50, nuclear extracts were employed, instead of whole-cell lysates, using the nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Protein concentrations of whole-cell lysates and nuclear extraction in the supernatants were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), blocked in 10% skim milk, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, and probed with primary antibodies. Following incubation with anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked antibody or anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody, bound immunoglobulins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). NFκB p50 DNA-binding Activity—After treatment with RANKL (100 ng/ml) for the indicated time, the infected cells (72 h post-infection) were harvested. Afterward, nuclear extraction was prepared as described previously. NFκB p50 DNA-binding activity of infected cells by RANKL was measured using the Mercury Transfactor kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cleaved Caspase-3 Activity—After 2–3 days of infection, retrovirally transduced cells were harvested. Thereafter, whole-cell lysates were prepared as described previously. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction was harvested. Cleaved caspase-3 activity assay of cell extracts was measured using the PathScan cleaved caspase-3 sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Apoptosis in Situ Marker—Infected cells undergoing apoptosis were identified by the CaspACE fluorescein isothiocyanate-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone in situ marker (Promega). A fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate of the cell permeable caspase inhibitor VAD-fluoromethyl ketone strongly labeled activated caspase, serving as an in situ marker for apoptosis. The bound marker was localized by fluorescence detection. Cell Viability Assay—To deplete M-CSF, infected cells were washed twice with α minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the absence of M-CSF after 3 days of infection. The infected cells were further cultured for the indicated times, and then viable cell counts were determined by trypan blue dye exclusion (Sigma) in triplicate assays. The number of viable infected cells remaining at the different time points is shown as a percentage of the infected cells at time zero. Cell Proliferation Assay—Proliferation assay was carried out using CellTiter96 AQueous One solution cell proliferation assays (Promega). Briefly, at the indicated time points of post-infection, the AQueous One solution was added to the infected cells and measured at 490 nm. siRNA-induced Gene Silencing in Isolated Osteoclast Precursors—To test whether Akt1, Akt2, mTOR, and Bim siRNA could induce gene-specific silencing in primary bone marrow macrophages, we first performed Western blotting to measure these expressed proteins. The loss of Akt1 inhibited the expression of Akt1 protein at both 48 and 72 h after infection, whereas Akt2 protein expression was unaffected (Fig. 1A). Similarly, depletion of Akt2 suppressed the expression of Akt2 protein; however, Akt1 protein expression had no effects (Fig. 1B). In addition, mTOR and Bim siRNA gene silencing also abolished these protein expressions by 48 and 72 h post-infection (Fig. 1, C and D). Akt1/Akt2 Are Essential for Osteoclast Differentiation—Despite histopathological examination demonstrating no significant differences between wild-type and Akt1-deficient mice in most adult tissues, except testes, Akt1-deficient mice were smaller when compared with wild-type littermates (10Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Similarly, Akt2-null mice also were smaller than wild-type mice (11Garofalo R.S. Orena S.J. Rafidi K. Torchia A.J. Stock J.L. Hildebrandt A.L. Coskran T. Black S.C. Brees D.J. Wicks J.R. McNeish J.D. Coleman K.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, these reports do not describe the influence of Akt on bone tissues. In contrast, Akt1/Akt2 DKO revealed delay of bone development and small bodies compared with control mice (5Peng X-d. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). However, chondrogenesis, osteoblastogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis in Akt1/ Akt2 DKO are largely unknown. Thus, Akt seems to play an important role in skeletal development. To analyze the role of Akt in osteoclastogenesis, we utilized RANKL-induced differentiation of osteoclast precursors. RANKL activates the IKK/IκB-α/NFκB axis for osteoclastogenesis (6Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). Ordinarily, NFκB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein IκB-α. RANKL promotes IκB degradation, thereby allowing NFκB to enter the nucleus and induce gene transcription involved in osteoclast differentiation (6Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). We investigated whether loss of Akt1 and/or Akt2 protein suppresses osteoclast differentiation. As predicted, Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of IKKα/β and IκB-α showed that IKKα/β and IκB-α were transiently and rapidly phosphorylated by 5 min after RANKL stimulation in scrambled siRNA expressing cells, and nuclear translocation of NFκB p50 was induced by RANKL at 5 min in control cells (Fig. 2). However, these effects of RANKL were inhibited by Akt1 and/or Akt2 siRNA gene silencing (Fig. 2). RANKL also stimulated NFκB p50 DNA-binding activity by 5 min in scrambled and mTOR siRNA-expressing cells, and its activity was gradually decreased over 30 min (Fig. 3). In contrast, Akt1 and/or Akt2 siRNA gene silencing abolished RANKL-stimulated NFκB p50 DNA-binding activity at the indicated times (Fig. 3). Consistent with these results, the TRAP-positive osteoclast formation number was reduced in Akt1 and/or Akt2 siRNA-expressing cells with RANKL and M-CSF (Fig. 4), indicating that Akt1/Akt2 play an essential role in osteoclast differentiation.Fig. 3Akt1 and/or Akt2 inhibit RANKL-induced NFκB p50 DNA-binding activity. After infection for 72 h, BMMs were treated with RANKL (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times, and nuclear extracts were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

After 4 days, the cells were then fixed and stained for TRAP, and the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (MNCs) was scored.

However, the possibility remains that the TRAP-positive osteoclast formation number was further reduced by Akt1 and/or Akt2 siRNA-induced apoptosis. To explore this possibility, we utilized a cleaved caspase-3 activity assay and apoptosis detection with an in situ fluorescent marker assay under treatment with M-CSF. The increase of cleaved caspase-3 activity is observed in the cells undergoing apoptosis (12Sugatani T. Alvarez U. Hruska K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5001-5008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, loss of Akt1 and/or Akt2 protein failed to induce cleaved caspase-3 activity by 48 and 72 h post-infection (Fig. 5A). Apoptotic cells also were not detected in Akt1 and/or Akt2 siRNA-expressing cells by fluorescence microscopy at 72 h post-infection (Fig. 5B). Moreover, we performed cell viability assays using trypan blue staining to measure cell survival rate in Akt1 and Akt2 siRNA-expressing cells. However, there was no difference between control cells and infected cells in the indicated times after M-CSF withdrawal (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, in these assays, Akt1 and/or Akt2 siRNA gene silencing induced apoptosis in the NIH-3T3 fibroblastic cell line (data not shown), strongly suggesting that Akt1/Akt2 are dispensable for cell survival in isolated osteoclast precursors. mTOR and Bim Are Required for Cell Survival of Isolated Osteoclast Precursors—M-CSF is essential for survival and proliferation of osteoclast precursors (6Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). It was first reported that Akt plays the major role in the regulation of apoptosis in neuronal cells (13Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). After that, numerous studies have reported that Akt plays a central role of cell survival in most cells in in vitro experiments (1Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 2Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3718) Google Scholar). However, Akt1-deficient mice displayed no significant increase in apoptosis in all other examined tissues, except testes and thymus, in TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays (10Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Moreover, no increase in spontaneous apoptosis was observed in Akt1/Akt2 DKO new-borns and embryonic day 18.5 embryos by TUNEL analysis (5Peng X-d. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In skeletal biology, there is widespread belief that Akt is essential for the cell survival of isolated mature osteoclasts (6Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar, 14Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol.

Commun. 2003; 305: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, so far, no data of Akt cell survival function on M-CSF signaling in isolated osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts lacking Akt1 and/or Akt2 have been published. Consistent with our data, recent studies have shown that Akt is not required for cell survival in hematopoietic cells (16Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 17Bao H. Jacobs-Helber S.M. Lawson A.E. Penta K. Wickrema A. Sawyer S.T. Blood. 1999; 93: 3757-3773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7002-7009PubMed Google Scholar). The cells of the osteoclast lineage also develop from hematopoietic cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage (6Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). What does regulate cell survival and apoptosis of osteoclast precursors? The first candidate is Bad. However, phosphorylation of Bad, which occurs downstream of Akt, does not play an important role in the cytokine-mediated survival of hematopoietic cells (16Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 17Bao H. Jacobs-Helber S.M. Lawson A.E. Penta K. Wickrema A. Sawyer S.T. Blood. 1999; 93: 3757-3773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7002-7009PubMed Google Scholar). We also failed to detect Bad phosphorylation by RANKL and M-CSF in isolated osteoclast precursors (19Sugatani T. Alvarez U.M. Hruska K.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The second candidate is NFκB, because NFκB inhibitors induce apoptosis of isolated mature osteoclasts and inhibit bone resorption (20Ozaki K. Takeda H. Iwahashi H. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, no increase in apoptosis has been observed in cells of the osteoclast lineage in NFκB p50/p52 DKO (21Xing L.

The third candidate is mTOR. mTOR is a key downstream mediator of hematopoietic cell survival (22Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 59: 886-894Google Scholar). Previously, we have demonstrated, using rapamycin (an inhibitor of mTOR), that mTOR is essential for the survival of isolated osteoclast precursors, and rapamycin completely blocked osteoclast formation (19Sugatani T. Alvarez U.M. Hruska K.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, M-CSF, TNF-α, and RANKL also promote osteoclast survival by signaling through mTOR (23Glantschnig H. Fisher J.E. Wesolowski G. Rodan G.A. Reszka A.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The final candidate is Bim, a member of the BH3-only subfamily of cell death activators (24Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U. Fukuda A. Hikita A. Seto H. Okada T. Inaba T. Sanjay A. Baron R. Kawaguchi H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Strasser A. Tanaka S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6653-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Bim down-regulation has important implications for cell survival in hematopoietic cells (24Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U. Fukuda A. Hikita A. Seto H. Okada T. Inaba T. Sanjay A. Baron R. Kawaguchi H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Strasser A. Tanaka S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6653-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Bim knock-out mice have shown that Bim is essential for apoptosis of T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte, and myeloid cells (24Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U. Fukuda A. Hikita A. Seto H. Okada T. Inaba T. Sanjay A. Baron R. Kawaguchi H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Strasser A. Tanaka S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6653-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bim knock-out mice exhibited mild osteosclerosis (24Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U. Fukuda A. Hikita A. Seto H. Okada T. Inaba T. Sanjay A. Baron R. Kawaguchi H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Strasser A. Tanaka S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6653-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The life span of Bim–/– osteoclasts were elongated and resistant to cytokine withdrawal-induced apoptosis, but osteoclasts (Bim–/–) had abnormally low bone resorption activity (24Akiyama T. Bouillet P. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Chung U. Fukuda A. Hikita A. Seto H. Okada T. Inaba T. Sanjay A. Baron R. Kawaguchi H. Oda H. Nakamura K. Strasser A. Tanaka S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6653-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We investigated whether loss of mTOR promoted apoptosis in isolated osteoclast precursors. Depletion of mTOR protein markedly induced cleaved caspase-3 activity compared with control after infection at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 5A). Moreover, apoptotic cells were obviously observed in mTOR siRNA-expressing cells by 72 h post-infection using the detection of apoptosis by in situ marker assay (Fig. 5B). In contrast, Bim siRNA gene silencing, expected to increase survival, failed to stimulate cleaved caspase-3 activity, and we were not able to detect apoptotic cells in Bim siRNA-expressing cells (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, in the cell viability assay, mTOR siRNA gene silencing quickly induced apoptosis by 3 h after M-CSF withdrawal, and most cells died by 12 h (Fig. 5C). In contrast, loss of Bim protein induced resistance to M-CSF withdrawal-induced apoptosis by 12 and 24 h compared with control (Fig. 5C). Moreover, depletion of mTOR protein completely blocked osteoclast formation; however, it seems that this effect is the influence of apoptosis by mTOR siRNA gene silencing (Fig. 4). These results indicate that M-CSF-mediated mTOR and Bim are essential for cell survival in osteoclast precursors. Akt1/Akt2 Are Dispensable for Cell Proliferation—Akt and mTOR regulate cell proliferation in most cells (25Panwalkar A. Verstovsek S. Giles F.J. Cancer. 2004; 100: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although M-CSF stimulated cell proliferation in scrambled, Akt1, and/or Akt2 siRNA-expressing cells, depletion of Akt1 or Akt2 protein suppressed cell proliferation when compared with control by 72 and 96 h post-infection. Moreover, loss of Akt1 and Akt2 protein also inhibited cell proliferation when compared with scrambled, Akt1, or Akt2 siRNA-expressing cells by 72 and 96 h after infection (Fig. 6). In contrast, consistent with previous reports, mTOR siRNA gene silencing failed to induce cell proliferation (Fig. 6), indicating that Akt1/Akt2 do not play a critical role of cell proliferation in osteoclast precursors. mTOR Down-regulates Bim Expression for Cell Survival in Isolated Osteoclast Precursors—Both mTOR and Akt1/Akt2 are downstream effectors of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which mediates cell survival in the most cells (25Panwalkar A. Verstovsek S. Giles F.J. Cancer. 2004; 100: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that Akt1/Akt2 are not required for cell survival in osteoclast precursors (Fig. 5). Thereby, we postulated that the activation of mTOR is positively regulated by PI3K (but not by Akt) and that mTOR regulates Bim expression for cell survival in osteoclast precursors under treatment with M-CSF. To study these hypotheses, we used LY294002 (inhibitor of PI3K), rapamycin, (inhibitor of mTOR) and carried out Akt1, Akt2, or mTOR siRNA retrovirus infection into isolated osteoclast precursors. Although M-CSF activated Akt (threonine 308 and serine 473) and mTOR by 5 min in osteoclast precursors, these effects were blocked by LY294002 (Fig. 7, A and B). Moreover, M-CSF phosphorylated mTOR by 5 min in scrambled, Akt1, or Akt2 siRNA-expressing cells. In contrast, rapamycin blocked phosphorylation of mTOR by M-CSF; however, rapamycin failed to block phosphorylation of Akt (threonine 308 and serine 473) in the indicated times (Fig. 7, C and D), suggesting that mTOR is a downstream effector of the PI3K (but not Akt) in isolated osteoclast precursors. In addition, the expression of Bim gradually increased by 3 h after M-CSF withdrawal in control cells, whereas M-CSF completely blocked Bim expression (Fig. 8A). In contrast, Bim expression continued at high levels in mTOR siRNA-expressing cells without M-CSF in the indicated times, and M-CSF failed to affect Bim expression (Fig. 8B). This indicates that Bim is downstream of mTOR, and M-CSF-mediated mTOR down-regulates Bim expression for cell survival in isolated osteoclast precursors. Down-regulation of Bim by siRNA increased osteoclast precursor survival following M-CSF withdrawal (Fig. 5C) and in mTOR siRNA expressing cells (not shown).Fig. 8mTOR down-regulates Bim expression for cell survival in BMMs. A and B, after infection for 48 h, BMMs were treated with or without M-CSF (20 ng/ml) for the indicated times, and whole-cell extracts were electrophoresed and analyzed by immunoblotting (IB).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 9, our results implicate activation of Akt1/Akt2 as a key event in osteoclast differentiation mediated through NFκB but not cell survival. The AP-1 component c-fos is also a very important transcription factor, because mice without this protein lack osteoclasts and are osteopetrotic but have an increased number of bone marrow macrophages (6Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that Akt1/Akt2 regulate NFκB p50 DNA-binding activity for osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 3), but Akt1 and/or Akt2 siRNA gene silencing failed to influence c-fos DNA-binding activity in isolated osteoclast precursors (data not shown). We also indicated that the mTOR/Bim signal is essential for cell survival of isolated osteoclast precursors (Figs. 5, 7, and 8). Surprisingly, Akt was dispensable for cell survival in our data (Fig. 5). This was an unexpected result for us. However, it has been shown that the PI3K/Akt signal can protect against apoptosis in hematopoietic cells (26Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 27Kinoshita T. Shirouzu M. Kamiya A. Hashimoto K. Yokoyama S. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas the role of Akt in this system has been controversial. Although several laboratories emphasized a marginal capacity of Akt to reverse apoptosis due to cytokine withdrawal (28Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 29Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, our results support previous negative findings. Thus, we provide the first evidence that Akt activity is critical for osteoclast differentiation but not cell survival, and mTOR/Bim play central roles in cell survival of isolated osteoclast precursors.

However, the mechanisms by which the ER maintains its characteristic structure are largely unknown. Here we show that the integral ER-membrane protein VAP-B causes a striking rearrangement of the ER through interaction with the Nir2 and Nir3 proteins. We provide evidence that Nir (Nir1, Nir2, and Nir3)-VAP-B interactions are mediated through the conserved FFAT (two phenylalanines (FF) in acidic tract) motif present in Nir proteins. However, each interaction affects the structural integrity of the ER differently. Whereas the Nir2-VAP-B interaction induces the formation of stacked ER membrane arrays, the Nir3-VAP-B interaction leads to a gross remodeling of the ER and the bundling of thick microtubules along the altered ER membranes. In contrast, the Nir1-VAP-B interaction has no apparent effect on ER structure. We also show that the Nir2-VAP-B interaction attenuates protein export from the ER.

Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It contains several structurally distinct domains, including the NE, the rough and smooth ER (rER and sER), and the regions that contact other organelles, such as the Golgi apparatus, the late endosomes, the lysosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the plasma membrane (2Voeltz G.K. Rolls M.M. Rapoport T.A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The ER functions in diverse metabolic processes including lipid synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and the detoxification of drugs. It is responsible for the synthesis, translocation, glycosylation, folding, assembly, and processing of secretory and membrane proteins, and it functions in intracellular calcium storage and sequestering (3Baumann O. Walz B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 205: 149-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 4Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). While the function of the ER in membrane trafficking, lipid biosynthesis, and calcium signaling have been extensively studied, the mechanism by which the ER maintains its characteristic structure in vivo remains largely unknown. Studies from yeast and mammalian cells have shown that the size and/or structure of the ER is extremely sensitive to certain cellular stress conditions, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) or to the overexpression of a subset of ER-resident membrane proteins (5Powell K.S. Latterich M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 6Sitia R. Meldolesi J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Overexpression of 3-hydroxymethyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase (msALDH), cytochrome P-450, and malfolded cytochrome P-450, causes the proliferation of ER membranes and stacking of the ER cisternae into organized structures known as crystalloid ER, sinusoidal ER, or karmellae (7Yamamoto A.

Keller G. Gould S.J. Subramani S. Rine J. New Biol. 1990; 2: 915-921PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of these structures is easily visible and can be used as a quantitative method for studying ER membrane biogenesis (5Powell K.S. Latterich M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of their formation is not completely understood. It has been proposed that proteins that regulate lipid metabolism, such as HMG-CoA reductase, induce the formation of these structures because of the extensive requirement of membrane biogenesis. However, subsequent studies suggested that the oligomerization state of the ER integral membrane proteins is crucial for their production (7Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gong F.C. Giddings T.H. Meehl J.B. Staehelin L.A. Galbraith D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The organization of the ER is also sensitive to drugs that induce microtubule depolymerization, such as colchicine or nocodazole. These drugs cause retraction of the ER tubules from the cell periphery and consequently, the formation of ER membrane aggregates around the nucleus. It has long been known that the ER uses the microtubules as a framework for extending and maintaining its reticular organization in animal cells (1Cole N.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 15Terasaki M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 15: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The interaction of the ER with microtubules is mediated by motor proteins, which interact directly with microtubules and concomitantly with the ER membranes via protein-protein interactions. Their interaction with the ER and their motor activity are required for the sliding of ER tubules along stationary microtubules and consequently, motility of the ER network. In contrast, the position of the ER within the cells and its motility by microtubule movement or tip-attachment mechanisms (3Baumann O. Walz B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 205: 149-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) require static association of the ER membranes with microtubules, and this is thought to be mediated by proteins such as p63 or cytoplasmic linker proteins (CLIPs). p63 is a type II integral ER membrane protein that binds directly to microtubules via its cytoplasmic domain and thereby links the ER membranes to the microtubule network (16Klopfenstein D.R. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6168-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Schweizer A. Ericsson M. Bachi T. Griffiths G. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 671-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CLIPs are soluble non-motor microtubule-binding proteins that link microtubules to intracellular organelles by binding a putative membrane receptor. Among the CLIPs, CLIP-170 links endosomes to microtubules and might be involved in the regulation of ER extension (18Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). VAP-B is also a type II integral membrane protein of ∼31 kDa that has been previously localized to the ER and the pre-Golgi intermediates (19Soussan L. Burakov D. Daniels M.P. Toister-Achituv M. Porat A. Yarden Y. Elazar Z. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Skehel P.A. Fabian-Fine R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It belongs to a highly conserved family of proteins, which are implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, ER-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport, Glu4 (glucose transporter 4) trafficking, stabilization of presynaptic microtubules, and the expression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes (19Soussan L.

Traffic. 2000; 1: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These diverse functions have been demonstrated in different species and cell types, and are mediated by different members of this family. Nevertheless, the overall structures of VAP proteins are similar and consist of a large N-terminal region facing the cytoplasm and a hydrophobic C terminus that functions as a transmembrane domain (TMD) (20Skehel P.A. Fabian-Fine R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic region contains a conserved N-terminal domain of 100 amino acids, which shares high sequence similarity with the nematode major sperm protein (MSP). This 100 amino acid domain contains a highly conserved sequence of 16 amino acids. The central part of the cytoplasmic region contains a coiled-coil domain of ∼40 amino acids, which is a common motif in many t-SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein (SNAP) receptor) proteins (26Weimbs T.

The VAP proteins interact with several intracellular proteins and have the ability to interact with each other (27Nishimura Y. Hayashi M. Inada H. Tanaka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Wyles J.P. McMaster C.R. Ridgway N.D. J. Biol.

Originally, the Aplysia ApVAP33 was isolated as a VAMP/synaptobrevin-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid screen (21Skehel P.A. Armitage B.A. Bartsch D. Hu Y. Kaang B.K. Siegelbaum S.A. Kandel E.R. Martin K.C. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated the interaction of the mammalian VAP-A with additional SNAREs, including syntaxin 1A, rbet1, rsec22, αSNAP, and NSF (29Weir M.L. Xie H. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). VAP-A also interacts with the tight junction protein occludin (22Lapierre L.A. Tuma P.L. Navarre J. Goldenring J.R. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with microtubules (20Skehel P.A. Fabian-Fine R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29908-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated VAP-B as an interacting protein with Nir2, using a pull-down experiment and mass spectrometry analysis. Similar to VAP-B, Nir2 also belongs to a highly conserved family of proteins, the Nir/rdgB, which are implicated in the regulation of membrane trafficking, phospholipid metabolism, and signaling (30Lev S. Hernandez J. Martinez R. Chen A. Plowman G. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2278-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lev S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we show that the three Nir proteins: Nir1, Nir2, and Nir3, interact with VAP-B via their FFAT motif, and that Nir-VAP interactions differentially affect the organization of the ER. Recombinant DNA and Antibodies—The cDNA of human VAP-B was isolated by PCR using a first-strand cDNA, which was synthesized from total RNA of HeLa cells (SuperScript II first strand synthesis system, Invitrogen), as a template and the following sense and antisense oligonucleutide primers; 5′-CCGGGATCCGCGAAGGTGGAGCA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATATCCTACAAGGCAATCTTCCCAAT-3′, respectively. The amplified PCR product was subcloned into the pCAN-Myc1 and pGE-X4T1 expression vectors. The FFAT mutant of Nir2 was generated by replacing amino acids 349–353 (EFFDA) with ALLAG using three sequential PCR steps with the following sense and antisense primers; 5′-GAGATCCTGGCCAACCGG-3′ and 5′-GTGCCCAGCGAGGAGAGCTTCCTCGGAGCTGTTCTC-3′ for the first PCR reaction; 5′-GAAGCTCTCCTCGCTGGGCACGAAGGCTTCTCGGAC-3′ and 5′-GATGGCCTGGAACTTCGGGGC-3′ for the second PCR reaction. The two PCR products were mixed together and amplified by a third set of sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers; 5′-GAGATCCTGGCCAACCGG-3′ and 5′-GATGGCCTGGAACTTCGGGGC-3′, respectively. The PCR product was digested with PstI and BglII and used to replace the corresponding fragment in Nir2 cDNA. The cDNAs of the three Nirs were subcloned into pRK5 mammalian expression vector downstream of the CMV promoter. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tag was fused to the C-terminal of Nir1, Nir2, and Nir3 coding sequences, essentially as described previously (30Lev S. Hernandez J. Martinez R. Chen A. Plowman G. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2278-2288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing verified the DNA constructs. YFP-VSV-G construct was kindly provided by Koret Hirschberg (Tel-Aviv University, Israel). Antibody against Nir2 was raised in rabbits as described previously (32Litvak V. Argov R. Dahan N.

Polyclonal antibody against VAP-B was raised in rabbits immunized with a recombinant GST-VAP-B fusion protein. The antiserum was first run through a GST-bound agarose column, to remove the anti-GST antibodies. The flow-through was then affinity-purified on a GST-VAP-B-bound agarose column. Monoclonal antibody against β-tubulin was purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against HA and Myc were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibody against PDI was purchased from ABR (Affinity BioReagents). Alexa-488 donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes. Cy3-conjugated goat antirabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Cell Cultures, Transfections, and Indirect Immunofluorescence— HEK293 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). The cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (33Litvak V. Tian D. Carmon S. Lev S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5064-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected as indicated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and immunostained essentially as described previously (33Litvak V. Tian D. Carmon S. Lev S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5064-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cell Labeling, Extraction, Immunoprecipitations, and Pull-down Experiments—HeLa cells were washed with methionine-free DMEM and incubated in the same medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 400 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (EXPRE35S35S, Dupont/PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 6 h. The cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer containing: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used in either pull-down or immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described previously (34Tian D. Litvak V. Toledo-Rodriguez M. Carmon S. Lev S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2650-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified by standard procedures (Amersham Biosciences). For protein identification by mass spectrometry, GST, or GST-Nir2-(205–424) were cross-linked to the agarose beads using dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma). Following cross-linking termination and washing, the beads were incubated with HeLa cell lysate (from 107 cells) for 3 h at 4 °C, extensively washed, boiled in SDS-sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Gel Code and destained by multiple washing steps with double-distilled water. The protein bands were excised from the gel and subjected to protein identification by peptide mapping using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry after in-gel trypsinization (Technion, Israel). Chemical Cross-linking—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding VAP-B-Myc. 24 h later, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with 2 mm DSP (dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); Pierce), a reversible chemical crosslinker. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by incubating the cells with 100 mm glycine for 15 min at 4 °C. For reversing the crosslinking, the cells were incubated with 100 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed in PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. SDS sample buffer with or without 100 mm DTT was added, the samples were boiled for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. Sucrose Density Gradient Sedimentation—HEK293 cells expressing the indicated proteins were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Insoluble materials were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants (0.5 ml) were layered onto 10 ml of continuous 5–30% (w/v) sucrose density gradients in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and either 0.1% Triton X-100 or 1% SDS, as indicated. The gradients were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C, fractionated from the top to the bottom into 20 fractions of 0.5 ml, and analyzed by Western blotting. Protein markers including thyroglobulin (669 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) were separated and fractionated under the same conditions and detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. VSV-G Transport Assay—HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with an expression vector encoding the temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular somatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) fused to YFP (YFP-VSV-G), either alone or together with expression vectors encoding Nir2-HA, VAP-B-Myc, or Nir2-HA and VAP-B-Myc. Following 5 h, the cells were shifted to 40 °C to accumulate YFP-VSV-G in the ER. The cells were then incubated at 32 °C for different time periods in the presence of cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) to permit the transport of VSV-G from the ER along the secretory pathway. The cells were fixed at the indicated time points, immunostained with antibody against Myc or HA, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Hela cells grown in 35-mm Falcon dishes, were transfected as indicated, and fixed for 60 min in Karnovsky's fixative (3% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 5 mm CaCl2 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.1 m sucrose). The cells were then washed and scraped. The cell pellet was embedded in agar noble (1.7%) and postfixed with 1% OsO4, 0.5% potassium dichromate, and 0.5% potassium haxacyanoferrate in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. The cells were stained en bloc with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, followed by ethanol dehydration. Sections were cut using a diamond knife (Diatome, Biel, Switzerland), and stained by 2% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol and lead citrate. The samples were examined with transmission electron microscope FEI CM12 Eindhoven, Holland, at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV and recorded with a SIS Biocam CCD, 1024 × 1024 pixel camera. Isolation of VAP-B as a Nir2-interacting Protein—To gain a better insight into Nir2 cellular functions, we looked for Nir2-interacting proteins using coimmunoprecipitation assays. Control and Nir2-HA-transfected HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Several proteins were detected in the Nir2 immunocomplex in a specific manner, including a prominent one of ∼31 kDa (Fig. 1A). This protein was also found in the immunoprecipitates of several Nir2-truncated mutants, including a mutant that lacks the first 340 amino acids. However, it was not present in the immunocomplex of a truncated mutant lacking the first 440 amino acids of Nir2 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the interaction of Nir2 with the 31 kDa protein is mediated through amino acids 341–439. These results were further confirmed by a pulldown experiment using a GST fusion protein consisting of amino acids 205–424 of Nir2 as an affinity column and [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cell lysate. The 31 kDa protein was recovered on the Nir2 affinity column in a specific manner (Fig. 1C). Therefore, this column was used in the subsequent large scale pull-down experiment as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the 31 kDa protein was identified by mass spectrometry. This analysis identified two peptides corresponding to amino acids 20–31 and 201–216 of the human VAP-B protein. Since VAP-B protein consists 243 amino acids and apparently migrates as a ∼31 kDa protein on SDS-PAGE (19Soussan L. Burakov D. Daniels M.P. Toister-Achituv M. Porat A. Yarden Y. Elazar Z. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we assumed that it is the 31 kDa protein that interacts with Nir2. To explore this possibility, the human VAP-B cDNA was isolated and subcloned into a mammalian expression vector containing an N-terminal Myc tag. The Myc-tagged VAP-B protein was expressed in the expected size, and its interaction with Nir2 was determined by pull-down experiments using the GST-Nir2 fusion protein (amino acids 205–424) immobilized on glutathione beads as an affinity column. As shown in Fig. 1D, VAP-B interacts with the GST-Nir2 fusion protein but fails to interact with GST, suggesting that the 31 kDa protein is indeed VAP-B. Nirs Interact with VAP-B via Their Conserved FFAT Motif— Recently, the yeast homolog of VAP-B, Scs2p was shown to interact with Opi1p, through a conserved EFFDAXE motif designated FFAT (35Loewen C.J. Roy A. Levine T.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This motif is also found in the Nir2 protein at amino acids 349–355 and is highly conserved among the other Nir/rdgB family members. The presence of this motif within the region that mediates the interaction with the 31 kDa protein (amino acids 341 to 439; Fig. 1B) further supports our results and strongly suggests that the 31 kDa protein is indeed the VAP-B protein. To determine whether the interaction of Nir2 with VAP-B is mediated through its FFAT motif, the conserved EFFDA sequence was replaced by ALLAG. This mutagenesis completely abolished the interaction of Nir2 with VAP-B (Fig. 2A), indicating that the interaction of Nir2 with VAP-B is mediated by its FFAT motif. To demonstrate the interaction between endogenous VAP-B and Nir2 proteins, we raised a polyclonal antibody against VAP-B as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This antibody recognizes both the transfected and the endogenous VAP-B protein by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). Moreover, Western analysis of endogenous VAP-B immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells, revealed the presence of endogenous Nir2 in the VAP-B immunocomplex. Similarly, VAP-B was detected in the immunocomplex of Nir2. These results suggest that Nir2 and VAP-B interact with each other in vivo (Fig. 2C). Next, we assessed whether the other Nir proteins; Nir1 and Nir3, interact with VAP-B, as they also contain a FFAT motif (Fig. 2D). The results shown in Fig. 2E, clearly demonstrate the interaction of Nir1 and Nir3 with VAP-B, suggesting that the three Nir proteins interact with VAP-B via their FFAT motif. The Interaction of VAP-B with Nir2 Affects the ER Structure—The VAP-B protein was previously localized to the ER and to pre-Golgi intermediates by biochemical and immunocytochemical methods (19Soussan L. Burakov D. Daniels M.P. Toister-Achituv M. Porat A. Yarden Y. Elazar Z. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Nir2 mainly localizes in the Golgi apparatus, but it is also found in the ER in interphase cells (36Litvak V. Shaul Y.D. Shulewitz M. Amarilio R. Carmon S. Lev S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1513-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine the localization of VAP-B in HeLa cells, we used the anti-VAP-B antibody in indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analyses. The VAP-B protein exhibits a typical ER reticular localization. Similar localization was observed with the transfected VAP-B-Myc protein, and double immunostaining with antibody against protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), an ER marker, revealed their strong colocalization (Fig. 3A), suggesting that endogenous and transfected VAP-B proteins are localized in the ER. To gain a better understanding on Nir-VAP-B interactions, we coexpressed them together in HeLa cells and examined their subcellular localization using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analyses. Overexpression of wild-type Nir2 with VAP-B caused to production of large heterogeneous granular structures that were dispersed around the nucleus throughout the cytosol, in which Nir2 and VAP-B were strongly colocalized. These structures were not detected in cells that express Nir2 alone (data not shown), or coexpressed the FFAT mutant of Nir2 and VAP-B (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the interaction of Nir2 with VAP-B, and not simply their overexpression, induces the formation of these unusual structures. To determine the origin of these structures, we used several organelle-specific markers and analyzed their localization by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3B, the ER-resident protein PDI was strongly localized to these structures, whereas neither the Golgi markers, nor the endosomal or lysosomal markers were detected in these structures (data not shown). These results suggest that these structures were formed from the ER, and that Nir2-VAP-B interaction rearranges the normal structure of the ER. Furthermore, coexpression of Nir2 and VAP-B had no"

Given the phenotypic similarity between mutations that activate these signaling pathways, it seems likely that BMPs and Wnts operate in parallel or represent components of the same pathway, modulating osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we show that in C3H10T1/2 cells, Wnt-3A and BMP-6 proteins were inducers of osteoblast differentiation, as measured by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) induction. Surprisingly, sclerostin, noggin, and human BMP receptor 1A (BMPR1A)-FC fusion proteins blocked Wnt-3A-induced ALP as well as BMP-6-induced ALP activity. Dkk-1, a Wnt inhibitor, blocked Wnt-induced ALP activity but not BMP-induced ALP activity. Early Wnt-3A signaling as measured by β-catenin accumulation was not affected by the BMP antagonists but was blocked by Dkk-1. Wnt-3A induced the appearance of BMP-4 mRNA 12 h prior to that of ALP in C3H10T1/2 cells. We propose that sclerostin and other BMP antagonists do not block Wnt signaling directly.

Wnt proteins are cysteine-rich, secreted glycoproteins that have been implicated in embryonic development and cellular differentiation, in particular limb patterning and chondrogenesis (10Wodarz A.

Given the interaction between the BMP and Wnts in osteoblastic cells described in the literature (8Fischer L. Boland G. Tuan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30870-30878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Bain G. Muller T. Wang X. Papkoff J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), we were interested in investigating whether BMP antagonists, in particular sclerostin, could modify Wnt activity. Our findings show that the sclerostin antagonism of Wnt-3A-induced activity was not due to a direct interaction between the proteins or between sclerostin and the Wnt signaling pathway. We conclude that sclerostin inhibition of Wnt activity is mediated by BMP proteins and that Wnt induction of ALP in C3H10T1/2 cells is dependent on the expression of BMPs. Effects of Sclerostin, Other BMP Antagonists, and Wnt-3A on ALP Activity in Mouse Mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 Cells—C3H10T1/2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were plated in 96-well dishes (25,000 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with high glucose and glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3).

Cells were harvested 72 h later for assay of ALP activity (Pierce) by determining the amount of p-nitrophenol synthesized from p-nitrophenylphosphate ((A405 nm)/mg of protein/30 min of incubation at room temperature). Similar experiments were also conducted with conditioned medium collected from murine L1 cells stably transfected with a Wnt-3A expression vector (L Wnt-3A, American Type Culture Collection) (15Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All recombinant BMP antagonists, Wnt proteins, and Dkk-1 were purchased from R&D Systems. Reverse Transcription-PCR—C3H10T1/2 cells were plated in regular growth medium and treated with 600 ng/ml BMP-6 or 100 ng/ml Wnt3A. Cells were harvested at various time points for preparation of RNA. RNA was prepared using Strataprep Absolutely RNA mini-prep kits (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 μg of total RNA, oligo(dT) primers, and the Superscript First Strand cDNA synthesis system according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and the following PCR primers were used to detect the expression of the murine genes coding for ALP, BMP-4, and the housekeeping gene, defender against death (DAD) (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) were treated with recombinant Wnt-3A (0.1 μg/ml), human sclerostin-FLAG (40 μg/ml), noggin-FC (5 μg/ml), BMP R1A-FC (40 μg/ml), and Dkk-1 (5 μg/ml). After 30 min, the plates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were harvested with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Protein concentrations were normalized, and Western blot analysis was performed with an anti-β-catenin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Sclerostin and Other BMP Antagonists Block BMP-induced and Wnt-induced ALP Activity—To determine whether sclerostin affects the activity of Wnt proteins, we compared the effects of sclerostin on BMP- and Wnt-induced activity in murine C3H10T1/2 cells. BMP-6 stimulated ALP activity in C3H10T1/2 cells. As we have shown previously (3Winkler D.G. Sutherland M.K. Geoghegan J.C. Yu C. Hayes T. Skonier J.E. Shpector D. Jonas M. Kovacevich B.R. Staehling-Hampton K. Appleby M. Brunkow M.E. Latham J.A. EMBO J. 2003; : 6267-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), human sclerostin-FLAG reduced this ALP activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Noggin-FC and gremlin also demonstrated blocking behavior (Fig. 1). ALP activity in the C3H10T1/2 cells was enhanced upon treatment of the cells with purified recombinant Wnt-3A protein or conditioned medium from murine L1 cells stably expressing Wnt-3A protein (data not shown). This Wnt-induced ALP activity was diminished with increasing concentrations of sclerostin, noggin-FC, and gremlin (Fig. 1). BMP Receptor 1A (BMPR1A) Blocks Both BMP-induced and Wnt-induced ALP Activity, and Dkk-1 Blocks Wnt but Not BMP-induced ALP Activity—To investigate the underlying mechanism by which sclerostin decreased Wnt-induced ALP activity, we sought to disrupt ALP induction through the use of antagonists with restricted modes of action. This was accomplished through the use of soluble BMP receptor 1A (BMPR1A) and Dkk-1, a known inhibitor of the Wnt pathway (16Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 cells were treated with a fixed amount of BMP-6 or Wnt-3A in the presence of increasing concentrations of BMPR1A or Dkk-1. The results are shown in Fig. 2. BMPR1A decreased BMP-6-induced ALP activity and Wnt3A-induced ALP activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). In contrast, Dkk-1 effectively decreased Wnt-3A-induced ALP activity but had no effects on BMP-induced ALP activity (Fig. 2). Collectively, these data begin to delineate the interplay between the BMP and Wnt pathways. Wnt-3A Induces mRNAs for BMP-4—Our observations that BMPR1A and other BMP antagonists were able to reduce Wnt-3A-induced ALP activity suggested that BMPs played a role in the Wnt-3A-induction of ALP activity. To investigate this, C3H10T1/2 cells were treated with BMP-6 or Wnt-3A, and RNA was prepared and analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR for the presence of a select group of BMPs. As can be seen in Fig. 3, ALP mRNA levels were apparent in BMP-6-treated cells at the 6-h time point, whereas there was a 12-h delay in the Wnt-treated cells. In the latter, the increase in ALP mRNA levels is preceded by the appearance of mRNA for BMP-4, highlighting the differential timing of induction. The mRNA levels for BMP-4 and ALP in the Wnt samples peaked by 24 h and slowly decreased over the 72-h incubation period. The timing of Wnt-3A induction of BMP-4 and ALP is consistent with BMP-4 being a critical autocrine factor for the Wnt-induced ALP in C3H10T1/2 cells. Sclerostin and Other BMP Antagonists Do Not Block Wnt Signaling—Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway leads to the accumulation of β-catenin (13Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 14Salic A. Lee E. Mayer L. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To determine whether sclerostin interacts with Wnt-3A and affects immediate-early Wnt signaling, the accumulation of β-catenin was assessed in mouse L1 cells treated with Wnt in the presence or absence of sclerostin. Wnt-3A increased the accumulation of β-catenin, which in turn was significantly reduced in cells treated with the Dkk-1 inhibitor (Fig. 4). In contrast, neither sclerostin, BMPR1A, nor noggin exhibited any significant effects on Wnt-induced β-catenin levels (Fig. 4), supporting the hypothesis that these BMP antagonists do not directly affect immediate-early Wnt signaling. There are many reports that describe the intertwined nature of BMP and Wnt signaling and their involvement in morphogenesis and cell differentiation (17Soshnikova N. Zechner D. Huelsken J. Mishina Y.

The recent description and characterization of the genes responsible for high bone mass syndromes (lrp-5 and sost) point to key roles for both Wnt and BMP pathways in osteoblast differentiation and maturation (2Gong Y.

Genet. 2002; 70: 11-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). In our analysis, we found that sclerostin is an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation induced by both Wnt and BMP pathways, suggesting that multiple antagonistic properties could be associated with this protein. This observation is not without precedent. Cerberus, a BMP antagonist with some similarity to sclerostin, was shown to bind to Wnt proteins as well as to nodal, suggesting that these BMP antagonists could be multifunctional inhibitors including inhibitors of Wnt proteins (20Piccolo S. Agius E. Leyns L. Bhattacharyya S. Grunz H. Bouwmeester T. De Robertis E.M. Nature. 1999; 397: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 21Kawano Y. Kypta R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). We have also shown that sclerostin is pleiotropic: blocking BMP activity as a BMP antagonist, but also binding to and neutralizing the activity of noggin, which results in the activation of BMP activity (22Winkler D. Yu C. Geoghegan J. Ojala E. Skonier J. Shpektor D. Sutherland M. Latham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36293-36298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we postulated that sclerostin might be a direct inhibitor of Wnt activity. However, we found that this inhibition was indirect. Instead, sclerostin inhibited BMPs produced in an autocrine loop by Wnt-3A. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway can be measured by the accumulation of β-catenin in the presence of Wnt protein (13Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 14Salic A. Lee E. Mayer L. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Sclerostin and other BMP antagonists had no effect on β-catenin accumulation, whereas Dkk-1, a Wnt inhibitor (16Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), was able to completely block Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation. We tested for physical interaction between Wnt-3A and sclerostin by Biacore analysis and immunoprecipitation and found no evidence of direct interaction (data not shown). We also found that other BMP antagonists including noggin, gremlin, and the BMPR1A-FC fusion protein could also block Wnt-induced ALP. Wnt-3A treatment of C3H10T1/2 cells strongly induced the expression of BMP-4 12 h before the appearance of ALP expression. From these data, we suggest that Wnt-3A induced the expression of BMPs, and it is this expression that is inhibited by the BMP antagonists (Fig. 5). The Wnt-induced BMP expression may or may not be mediated by β-catenin. In contrast to our results, Rawadi et al. (23Rawadi G. Vayssiere B. Dunn F. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Bone Miner Res. 2003; 18: 1842-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) reported that Wnt-induced ALP expression in C3H10T1/2 cells was blocked by Wnt inhibitors but not by BMP inhibitors, and conversely, BMP-induced ALP was inhibited by the Wnt inhibitor, Dkk 1. From these data, the authors concluded that BMP-induced ALP was dependent on Wnt signaling, a direct contradiction to our findings (23Rawadi G. Vayssiere B. Dunn F. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Bone Miner Res. 2003; 18: 1842-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The reasons for the differences in conclusions are unknown. A major difference between our studies is that we have used recombinant purified sources for our growth factors and antagonists, whereas Rawadi et al. (23Rawadi G. Vayssiere B. Dunn F. Baron R. Roman-Roman S. J. Bone Miner Res. 2003; 18: 1842-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) measured effects after a combination of transfections and use of recombinant factors. It is entirely possible that these or other technical differences could lead to such different conclusions. In summary, as would be expected from the high bone mass and the sclerosteosis phenotypes, both the Wnt and the BMP pathways regulate bone formation. In this study, sclerostin plays a role as master controller of both pathways, modulating both BMP and Wnt signaling by working as a BMP antagonist and demonstrates that BMPs are ultimate growth factors responsible for the commitment step for osteoblastic differentiation."

In study 1, mouse bone marrow and/or tumor were obtained every 4 h for 24 h in C3H/HeN mice with or without MA13/C mammary adenocarcinoma in order to determine the circadian patterns in cell-cycle phase distribution and BCL-2 anti-apoptotic protein expression. In study 2, mouse bone marrow from B6D2F1 mice was sampled every 3 h for 24 h in order to confirm the BCL-2 rhythm and to study its relation with 24 h changes in the expression of proapoptotic BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) protein and clock genes mPer2, mBmal1, mClock, and mTim mRNAs. The rhythms in G1-, S- or G2/M-phase cells were shifted in tumor compared with bone marrow. In the tumor, the mean proportion of G2/M-phase cells increased by 75% from late rest to late activity span (P from cosinor = 0.001). No 24 h rhythm was found for BCL-2 in tumors. In contrast to this, in the bone marrow, mean BCL-2 expression varied 2.8-fold in B6D2F1 mice (P=0.025) and 3- or 4.5-fold in tumor-bearing and nontumor-bearing C3H/HeN mice, with a peak during the early rest span (P=0.024 and P<0.001, respectively). BAX varied fivefold during the 24 h span with a major peak occurring near mid-activity (P=0.007). The mean mRNAs of mPer2, mClock, and mBmal1 varied twofold to threefold over the 24 h, with high values during the activity span (P<0.05). In the tumor, the circadian organization in cell-cycle phase distribution was shifted and BCL2 rhythm was ablated. Conversely, a molecular circadian clock likely regulated BCL-2 and BAX expression in the bone marrow, increasing cellular protection against apoptosis during the rest span."
https://openalex.org/W2128273234,"This study investigates the role of the antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in androgen-independent human prostate cancer (PC-3) cells' growth rate in vitro and in vivo. MnSOD levels were found to be lower in parental PC-3 cells compared to nonmalignant, immortalized human prostate epithelial cells (P69SV40T). To unravel the role of MnSOD in the prostate cancer phenotype, PC-3 cells were stably transfected with MnSOD cDNA plasmid. The MnSOD protein and activity levels in clones overexpressing MnSOD were increased seven- to eightfold. These cell lines showed elongated cell doubling time, reduced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar compared to parental PC-3 (Wt) cells, and reduced growth rate of PC-3 tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice. Flow cytometric studies showed an increase in membrane potential in the MnSOD-overexpressing clone (Mn32) compared to Wt and Neo cells. Also, production of extracellular H2O2 was increased in the MnSOD-overexpressing clones. As determined by DNA cell cycle analysis, the proportion of cells in G1 phase was enhanced by MnSOD overexpression. Therefore, MnSOD not only regulates cell survival but also affects PC-3 cell proliferation by retarding G1 to S transition. Our results are consistent with MnSOD being a tumor suppressor gene in human prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2095196401,"Trienoic fatty acids (TAs) are the major constituents in plant membrane lipids. In Arabidopsis, two plastidial isozymes of ω-3 fatty acid desaturase, FAD7 and FAD8, are the major contributors for TA production in leaf tissues. Despite a high degree of structural relatedness, activities of these two isozymes are regulated differentially in response to temperature. Elevated temperatures lead to decreases in leaf TA level due to temperature sensitivity of FAD8 activity. A series of FAD7-FAD8 chimeric genes, each encoding a functional plastidial ω-3 desaturase, were introduced into the Arabidopsis fad7fad8 double mutant. Constructs with or without a c-Myc epitope tag were tested. Functionality of each chimeric gene in response to temperature was assayed by Northern and Western analyses and by examining the fatty acid composition. All transformants harboring a chimeric gene containing the FAD8-derived C-terminal coding region (44 amino acids) showed a marked decrease in TA level when exposed to high temperature, similarly as transgenic lines complemented with the native form of FAD8. The reduction of TA level was accompanied by a decrease in the amount of ω-3 desaturase protein but not necessarily by a decrease in its transcript level. Analysis of the decay of c-Myc-tagged products after inhibiting protein synthesis revealed that the FAD8-derived C-terminal region acts in an autoregulatory fashion to destabilize the protein at high temperature. This suggests that the regulation of post-translational stability of FAD8 provides an important regulatory mechanism for modifying its activity in response to temperature, mediating a decrease in TA level at elevated temperatures.

This suggests that the regulation of post-translational stability of FAD8 provides an important regulatory mechanism for modifying its activity in response to temperature, mediating a decrease in TA level at elevated temperatures. Membrane lipids of plant cells are characterized by a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Typically, dienoic and trienoic fatty acids (DAs and TAs, respectively), 1The abbreviations used are: DA, dienoic fatty acid; TA, trienoic fatty acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MS, Murashige-Skoog; FAD (fad), fatty acid desaturase; 18:3, α-linolenic acid; 16:3, hexadecatrienoic acid; 18:2, α-linoleic acid; 16:2, hexadecadienoic acid; CHX, cycloheximide. account for as much as 70% of total fatty acids in leaf and root lipids (1Harwood J.L. Stumpf P.K. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants: A Comprehensive Treatise. 4. Academic Press, New York1980: 1-55Google Scholar). The abundance of TAs relative to DAs changes in accordance with environmental conditions. In particular, increasing and decreasing in TA levels have been observed in a variety of plant species exposed to low and high temperatures, respectively (2Smoleńska G. Kuiper P.J.C. Physiol. Plant. 1977; 41: 29-35Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Willemot C. Hope H.J. Williams R.J. Michaud R. Cryobiology. 1977; 14: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Horiguchi G. Kodama H. Nishimura M. Iba K. Planta. 1996; 199: 439-442Crossref Google Scholar). TAs are formed from DAs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in plastids by ω-3 fatty acid desaturases (5Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, FAD3 encodes an ER-localized ω-3 desaturase (6Arondel V. Lemieux B. Hwang I. Gibson S. Goodman H.M. Somerville C.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1353-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), whereas FAD7 and FAD8 encode plastidial isozymes of this enzyme (7Iba K. Gibson S. Nishiuchi T. Fuse T. Nishimura M. Arondel V. Hugly S. Somerville C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24099-24105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gibson S. Arondel V. Iba K. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the responses to temperature has been demonstrated in transgenic plants with modified leaf TA contents. For example, FAD7-deficient tobacco plants showed reduced leaf TA levels but performed better regarding growth and photosynthesis at high temperature (9Murakami Y. Tsuyama M. Kobayashi Y. Kodama H. Iba K. Science. 2000; 287: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of plastidial ω-3 desaturase activity is likely associated with the adaptation of plants to elevated temperatures. The production of TAs in root tissues depends predominantly on the activity of ER-localized FAD3 desaturase (10Lemieux B. Miquel M. Somerville C. Browse J. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1990; 80: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). According to previous studies in Arabidopsis and wheat, it is likely that temperature-regulated post-transcriptional mechanisms are involved in FAD3 expression (11Somerville C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6215-6218Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Horiguchi G. Fuse T. Kawakami N. Kodama H. Iba K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 805-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In wheat root tips, the enhanced accumulation of TAs upon exposure to lower temperatures was accompanied by an increase in the amount of FAD3 protein, which was not preceded by a concurrent increase in its transcript level (12Horiguchi G. Fuse T. Kawakami N. Kodama H. Iba K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 805-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the metabolism of TAs in the non-photosynthetic root tissues, the plastidial FAD7 and FAD8 desaturases are the major contributors for TA production in leaf tissues (13McConn M. Hugly S. Browse J. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). FAD8 was originally identified as a temperature-sensitive plastidial isozyme by phenotypic analysis of the fad7 mutant (14Browse J. McCourt P. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 859-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which FAD8 is the only functional ω-3 desaturase in plastids. Reduction in leaf TA level caused by the fad7 mutation is less pronounced at lower temperatures, implying that FAD8 activity is induced by low temperature. Consistent with this observation, the steady-state level of FAD8 transcripts increases in response to temperature drops within the physiological range, whereas FAD7 transcript accumulation is almost unresponsive to changing temperature (8Gibson S. Arondel V. Iba K. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It has therefore been postulated that temperature-dependent changes in leaf TA level are mostly due to transcriptional regulation of FAD8 expression. Despite this convincing explanation, there has been no direct evidence showing that the transcriptional regulation of FAD8 expression is actually the decisive event controlling the temperature sensitivity of FAD8 activity. A major hindrance preventing thorough investigation into the regulation of FAD8 expression has been the lack of an effective way to quantify the amount and activity of ω-3 desaturase. To overcome these difficulties, a series of FAD7-FAD8 chimeric genes, each encoding a functional plastidial ω-3 desaturase, either with or without a c-Myc epitope tag, was introduced into the Arabidopsis fad7fad8 double mutant. The functionality of each chimeric gene in response to temperature was analyzed from the transcriptional to post-translational levels. Here we describe a novel post-translational mechanism in which the C-terminal region of FAD8 desaturase acts in an autoregulatory fashion to destabilize the protein at high temperature, leading to a reduction of the concentration of this enzyme in the absence of a concurrent decrease in its transcript level. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions—All lines of Arabidopsis thaliana described here were derived from the Columbia wild type. The mutant lines fad7fad8 (Ref. 13McConn M. Hugly S. Browse J. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, stock number CS8036) and fad7 (Ref. 14Browse J. McCourt P. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 859-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, stock number CS3108) are available from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University. The mutant fad8 line was isolated from the progeny of a cross between the fad7fad8 and wild-type Columbia plants using restriction enzyme polymorphisms specific to the fad7 (15Kusumi J. Iba K. J. Plant Res. 1998; 111: 87-91Crossref Google Scholar) and fad8 (8Gibson S. Arondel V. Iba K. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) alleles. All transgenic lines were confirmed to be homozygous for the transgenes after two rounds of backcrossing. Unless otherwise described, plants were routinely grown at 22 °C under continuous white light on solid Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium (16Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol.

Construction of Chimeric Genes—All cloning techniques used in this study were essentially as described in Ref. 17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. The 5.9-kb F8 fragment, corresponding to nucleotides 40510–46390 of the P1 clone MOP10 (GenBank™ accession number AB005241) and including the endogenous FAD8 gene, was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of wild-type Columbia plants. The 7.0-kb F7 fragment, corresponding to nucleotides 34315–41363 of the BAC clone F11B9 (GenBank™ accession number AC073395) and including the endogenous FAD7 gene, was amplified by PCR from the same genomic DNA. All chimeric genes shown in Fig. 1 were constructed based on these two fragments according to exonintron structures described in the GenBank™ records. The FAD8-derived region encoding the C-terminal 52 amino acids of C6 was replaced in C6alt with a synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-TTA GGG AAG TAT TAC AGG GAG CCT AAA AAC TCT GGA CCG TTG CCA TTA CAT TTA CTG GGA AGT CTA ATC AAA AGT ATG AAA CAA GAT CAT TTC GTG AGC GAC ACA GGA GAT GTT GTA TAC TAT GAA GCA GAT CCA AAA CTC AAT GGA CAA AGA ACA-3′ (the substituted bases are underlined). To construct the chimeric genes for c-Myc-tagged desaturases, a duplex oligonucleotide 5′-GGC GAA CAA AAG TTG ATT TCT GAA GAA GAT TTG GCT AGC-3′ (the area encoding the 9E10 epitope of c-Myc protein (18Evan G.I.

Recombination between the F8 and F7 fragments and insertion of the oligonucleotides at precise positions was achieved by the recombinant PCR technique as described in Ref. 19Higuchi R.

All PCR products were sequenced to confirm the absence of PCR errors. Sequences of all chimeric genes used in this study are available on request. Transformation of Arabidopsis Plants—Each chimeric gene shown in Fig. 1 was unidirectionally ligated to the EcoRI/HindIII site of the binary vector pBI121 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) along with appropriate linker oligonucleotides. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis plants was performed by the vacuum infiltration procedure (20Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar). Positive transformants were selected for kanamycin resistance as described previously (21Matsuda O. Watanabe C. Iba K. Planta. 2001; 213: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fatty Acid Analysis—The fatty acid composition of total leaf lipids was determined by gas chromatography as described previously (22Kodama H. Hamada T. Horiguchi G. Nishimura M. Iba K. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For temperature-shift experiments, transgenic and fad mutant plants were shifted to 27 °C on day 13, and young rosette leaves (5 mm in length) that had developed after the temperature shift were harvested on day 18 for fatty acid analysis. Control plants were maintained at 22 °C until analysis on day 18. At least six independent measurements were performed for each line (X) to determine the mean (TA[X]t and DA[X]t) and S.D. of leaf TA and DA levels at each temperature (t). The TA level was calculated as the sum of 18:3 (α-linolenic acid) and 16:3 (hexadecatrienoic acid) levels, whereas the DA level was calculated as the sum of 18:2 (α-linoleic acid) and 16:2 (hexadecadienoic acid) levels. Values of these parameters are available on-line as Supplementary Material. Changes in leaf TA and DA levels, upon temperature upshift from 22 to 27 °C (ΔTA[X]22→27 and ΔDA[X]22→27 (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

ΔΔTA[X] 22→27=ΔTA[X] 22→27−ΔTA[fad7fad8] 22→27 ΔΔDA[X] 22→27=ΔDA[X] 22→27−ΔDA[fad7fad8] 22→27 Values of ΔTA, ΔDA, ΔΔTA, and ΔΔDA (X and t are usually omitted for simplicity) in different transgenic and mutant lines are summarized in Table I.Fig. 1Structures of FAD7-FAD8 chimeric genes used in complementation analysis of the fad7fad8 double mutant.

Within this region, 21 silent mutations were introduced to mimic the corresponding sequence of FAD7 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Red vertical lines indicate nucleotide positions encoding the C-terminal residue of the FAD7 transit peptide (Glu at position 81) predicted by the ChloroP program (31Emanuelsson O. von Nielsen H.

Dashed horizontal lines indicate regions used as hybridization probes for Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4B). Note that F7, C2, C6, their variants containing c-Myc sequence, and C6alt are driven by the FAD7 promoter, whereas all other constructs are driven by the FAD8 promoter.

Blotting and hybridization were performed based on the method of Amasino (25Amasino R.M. Anal.

The 3′-untranslated sequences of FAD7 and FAD8, corresponding to nucleotides 39282–39458 of F11B9 and 44952–45088 of MOP10, respectively, were used as hybridization probes (Fig. 1). Plants were shifted to 27 °C on day 17 and harvested on day 18 (after 24 h) for Northern blot analysis. Control plants were maintained at 22 °C until harvest on day 18.

Forty micrograms of proteins were separated on a 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used in this study included anti-c-Myc rabbit polyclonal antibody A14 (1:500 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-rabbit goat polyclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:30,000 dilution) (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the ECL Plus reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). After chemiluminescence detection, total proteins were visualized by staining the blots with Amido Black. Cycloheximide Treatment—Plants were transferred onto a nylon mesh (50 μm), layered onto solid MS medium on day 7, and allowed to grow at 22 °C until cycloheximide (CHX) treatment. The mesh prevented the growing roots from penetrating into the solid medium. On day 14, plants were transferred to liquid MS medium containing 200 μg/ml CHX in 0.2% (v/v) ethanol. The selected concentration of CHX has been shown to inhibit more than 92% of [35S]Met incorporation (29Ramos J.A. Zenser N. Leyser O. Callis J. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and, under our experimental conditions, plants became extensively chlorotic 3 days after starting the treatment. After incubation at either 22 or 27 °C for the times indicated in Fig. 5, total leaf proteins were extracted and used for Western blot analysis as described above. Novel Assay System for Temperature-sensitive FAD8 Gene Expression Based on Functional Complementation of the fad7fad8 Double Mutant—To develop an experimental system for assaying temperature-sensitive FAD8 expression, genetic complementation of the fad7fad8 double mutant was conducted using functional genomic clones of FAD7 and FAD8. It was expected that expression of FAD8 in this genetic background would result in acquisition of an fad7 mutant-like phenotype, which is discernible by its fatty acid composition. For this analysis, DNA fragments of the two genes covering the entire transcribed region associated with the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions (usually containing intrinsic promoters and terminators, respectively) were recovered from the wild-type genome (Fig. 1, F8 and F7). These fragments were then transferred into the fad7fad8 double mutant. Transgenic fad7fad8 lines harboring exogenous copies of FAD7 and FAD8, respectively, are designated as F7 and F8 lines. To identify the temperature-sensitive FAD8 expression, plants of several fad mutant and the transgenic lines were grown at two temperatures, 22 and 27 °C, prior to preparation of fatty acid samples. Within this temperature range, the leaf TA level changes drastically in the fad7 mutant, but only slightly in wild-type plants (14Browse J. McCourt P. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 859-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fad8 mutant has been shown to be almost indistinguishable from the wild type on the basis of fatty acid composition (13McConn M. Hugly S. Browse J. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, a temperature upshift from 22 to 27 °C caused a 12.1 ± 1.3% (mean ± S.D.) decrease in leaf TA level in the fad7 mutant (Table I, ΔTA), but only 3.1 ± 0.8% in wild-type plants. In the fad8 mutant, the decrease in leaf TA level resulting from the same treatment was 5.5 ± 0.7% (Table I, ΔTA), an amount significantly lower than the value obtained in the fad7 mutant (p < 0.01). In most of the F7 and F8 lines, the overall levels of TAs in leaf tissues were higher than in the fad8 and fad7 mutants, respectively (Fig. 3C). Despite such overexpression phenotypes, changes in leaf TA level in response to temperature were similar in all of the independent transgenic lines harboring the same construct. As examples for the low levels of endogenous FAD7 and FAD8 expression, we show the analyses of a single transgenic line of each construct (e.g. Fig. 3C, closed circles). In the representative F7 and F8 lines, the 5 °C-upshift in temperature resulted in decreases of leaf TA levels by 5.8 ± 1.2% and 15.1 ± 1.6%, respectively (Table I, ΔTA). These values differ significantly from each other (p < 0.01), whereas they are comparable to the values obtained in the fad8 and fad7 mutants, respectively. This result suggests the presence of regulatory sequences required for temperature-sensitive expression within the F8 fragment that are not present in the F7 fragment. C-terminal Coding Region of FAD8 Gene Is Essential for Temperature-sensitive FAD8 Desaturase Activity—To identify the regulatory sequences required for the temperature-sensitive FAD8 expression, a series of FAD7-FAD8 chimeric genes, each encoding a functional plastidial ω-3 desaturase, were constructed based on structural relatedness between the two genes (Fig. 1, C1–C6). As described above for the F7 and F8 transgenes, each construct was introduced into the fad7fad8 double mutant, and the level of complementation in response to temperature was assayed by examining the fatty acid composition. All transformants showed a temperature response similar to that observed in either the F7 or F8 line, and none of the transformants exhibited an exceptional phenotype (Table I and Fig. 2). To display clearly the type of temperature response that was acquired by expression of a given chimeric gene, net changes in leaf TA level attributable to transgene expression were calculated (Table I and Fig. 2A, ΔΔTA). These values were obtained by subtracting the effects of FAD3 activity inherent to the fad7fad8 genetic background (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because the flux of both TAs and DAs from the plastidial to the ER membrane is very low (30Browse J. McConn M. James Jr., D. Miquel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16345-16351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is unlikely that this baseline desaturase activity in the ER is largely affected by the activity of plastidial ω-3 desaturase derived from transgene expression. We estimated that, upon the 5 °C-upshift in temperature, F7 and F8 expression contributed +0.2 ± 1.6% and –9.1 ± 1.9%, respectively, to the changes in leaf TA levels. Similarly, the contribution of endogenous FAD7 and FAD8 expression in the fad8 and fad7 mutants, respectively, could be estimated to be +0.5 ± 1.3% and –6.1 ± 1.7% (Table I and Fig. 2A, ΔΔTA). Thus, the procedure was successful in contrasting the differential temperature sensitivity of F7 (FAD7) and F8 (FAD8) expression. An apparently larger contribution of F8 expression than of endogenous FAD8 expression would result from the higher level of transgene expression at the lower temperature (22 °C, Fig. 3C). The first two chimeric genes, C1 and C2, were constructed based on F8 and F7, respectively, by exchanging the open reading frame with each other (Fig. 1). As a result, C1 encoded FAD7 under the control of the putative FAD8 promoter, whereas C2 encoded FAD8 driven by the FAD7 promoter. The estimated changes in leaf TA levels attributable to C1 and C2 expression were +0.6 ± 1.5% and –6.6 ± 1.7%, respectively, values comparable to those in the F7 and F8 lines (Table I and Fig. 2A, ΔΔTA). It appeared that the temperature-sensitive FAD8 expression was regulated via the intragenic region rather than the regions flanking the open reading frame, irrespective of the transcriptional promoter. In agreement with this presumption, it was found that the F7-type expression of C1 could be reverted to the F8-type through a minor structural modification within the open reading frame. The next three constructs, C3 through C5, were developed from C1 by extending the FAD8-derived region so that they included the entire first and/or eighth exons, which encodes the N and C termini, respectively, of the desaturase (Fig. 1). Of these chimeric genes, C3 and C5 exhibited F8-type expression, leading to net changes in leaf TA levels attributable to transgene expression by –9.3 ± 1.8% and –8.0 ± 1.6%, respectively (Table I and Fig. 2A, ΔΔTA). Therefore, the FAD8-derived C-terminal coding region within the eighth exon was likely a prerequisite for F8-type expression. Accordingly, this region was inserted in place of the corresponding region of F7 to produce an additional chimeric gene (Fig. 1, C6). As expected, this C6 construct, despite being driven by the FAD7 promoter, exhibited an F8-type expression, giving –7.3 ± 1.8% of a net change in leaf TA level upon the 5 °C-upshift in temperature (Table I and Fig. 2A, ΔΔTA). Taken together, these results suggest that the C-terminal coding region of FAD8 alone is sufficient to induce an F8-type temperature-sensitive expression. In general, activity of ω-3 desaturase leads to production of TAs in parallel with consumption of their substrate DAs. This interrelation was still obvious between ΔΔTA and ΔΔDA, the values obtained after two rounds of subtraction (see “Experimental procedures”). As is evident from comparison between Figs. 2A and 2B, any contribution of transgene expression to decreases (or increases) of leaf TA level (ΔΔTA) was accompanied by a corresponding contribution to increases (or decreases) of leaf DA level (ΔΔDA). This consistency of the data is highly supportive of the above conclusion and suggests that TA as well as DA levels provide a measure for the degree of temperature sensitivity of expression of the chimeric genes. C-terminal Region of FAD8 Desaturase Rather Than Its Encoding Nucleotide Sequence Is Essential for Temperature-sensitive Activity—To evaluate whether the temperature-sensitive FAD8 activity, regulated via the C-terminal coding region, is associated with transcriptional regulation of FAD8 expression, steady-state transcript levels of several FAD7-FAD8 chimeric genes w"

We have investigated here the mechanisms of stimulation of P-Rex1 Rac-GEF activity by the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and the Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. We show that a P-Rex1 mutant lacking the PH domain (ΔPH) cannot be stimulated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which implies that the PH domain confers PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 regulation of P-Rex1 Rac-GEF activity. Consistent with this, we found that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binds to the PH domain of P-Rex1 and that the DH/PH domain tandem is sufficient for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-stimulated P-Rex1 activity. The Rac-GEF activities of the ΔPH mutant and the DH/PH domain tandem can both be stimulated by Gβγ subunits, which infers that Gβγ subunits regulate P-Rex1 activity by binding to the catalytic DH domain. Deletion of the DEP, PDZ, or inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase homology domains has no major consequences on the abilities of either PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or Gβγ subunits to stimulate P-Rex1 Rac-GEF activity. However, the presence of any of these domains impacts on the levels of basal and/or stimulated P-Rex1 Rac-GEF activity, suggesting that there are important functional interactions between the DH/PH domain tandem and the DEP, PDZ, and inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase homology domains of P-Rex1.

More than a dozen Rac-GEFs are known apart from the P-Rex family, for example, the Vav, Sos, and Tiam families (4Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Their Rac-GEF activities are tightly regulated, often by a combination of mechanisms. Some are activated by phosphorylation through protein kinases, e.g. Vav1 and Ras-GRF1 by Src family protein tyrosine kinases (5Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12753-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Another activating mechanism is binding to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), a lipid second messenger produced by class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 stimulates the Rac-GEF activities of P-Rex1, SWAP-70, Vav1, and Sos1 (9Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Finally, Rac-GEFs can be activated by protein interactions. For example, Tiam1 is activated by binding to GTP-Ras (10Lambert J.M. Lambert Q.T. Reuther G.W. Malliri A. Siderovski D.P. Sondek J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), Sos1 by the protein complex Abi1-Eps8 (11Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R. Tenca P. Giardina G. Gutkind S. Bjarnegard M.

Regulating accessibility of the substrate GTPase to the DH domain is an important mechanism governing GEF activation. In Vav1, the main regulatory phosphorylation site Y174 lies just NH2-terminal of the DH domain, and its phosphorylation relieves an autoinhibition between the peptide stretch around Y174 and the DH domain, thus activating the GEF (12Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Typically, the DH domain is in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a phosphoinositide binding domain, the role of which is still not completely understood and seems to vary between GEFs. Crystal structures of Sos1 and Tiam1 DH/PH tandems have shown that the DH and PH domains interact with one another. In Sos1, this interaction precludes access of Rac to its binding site (13Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), whereas in Tiam1 it does not (14Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For Vav, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to the PH domain facilitates Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation, thus enhancing its Rac-GEF activity (15Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Similarly, for Sos1, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to the PH domain seems to relieve the intramolecular inhibition between DH and PH, enabling Rac binding and, presumably, GEF activation (16Das B. Shu X. Day G-J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activity of Tiam1 is not affected by binding of another phosphoinositide, PtdIns 3-phosphate, to the PH domain in its DH/PH tandem (17Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As described above, P-Rex family enzymes are directly activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Gβγ subunits. Precedent would suggest that the binding site for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 lies within its PH domain, but the binding site for the Gβγ subunits is less predictable. One other Rac-GEF known to interact directly with Gβγ subunits is p114 Rho-GEF, an enzyme that activates RhoA and Rac1 in vivo (18Niu J. Profirovic J. Pan H. Vaiskunaite R. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). p114 Rho-GEF binds Gβγ subunits both via its DH/PH tandem and its COOH terminus, and overexpression of the p114 Rho-GEF DH/PH tandem together with Gβγ subunits in NIH3T3 cells results in downstream activation of the serum response element (18Niu J. Profirovic J. Pan H. Vaiskunaite R. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether Gβγ subunits regulate the catalytic activity of p114 Rho-GEF. The Rac-GEF activity of one other GEF, Ras-GRF1, is regulated by Gβγ subunits, but here the effect is indirect, via activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (19Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly, the CDC42-GEF activity of PIXα is stimulated by Gβγ subunits indirectly, via their binding to PAK1 (20Li Z. Hannigan M. Mo Z. Liu B. Lu W. Wu Y. Smrcka A.V. Wu G. Li L. Liu M. Huang C.K.

Other families of enzymes whose activities are directly regulated by Gβγ subunits do exist, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ, phospholipase Cβ, and adenylyl cyclase II, and the interactions between these enzymes and Gβγ subunits have been studied in some detail (21Krugmann S.

However, no consensus Gβγ binding motif can be inferred from this work that would predict how Gβγ subunits act on the P-Rex family. P-Rex family enzymes, like most GEFs, are multidomain proteins. Apart from the catalytic DH domain and tandem PH domain, they also contain two DEP domains (Disheveled, EGL-10, and pleckstrin homology) and two PDZ domains (post-synaptic density disc-large zo-1 homology). These are protein interaction domains that are frequently found in signaling proteins. It is emerging that DEP domains might generally serve to target their proteins to membranes, possibly by interactions with proteins of the SNARE superfamily (24Martemyanov K.A. Lishko P.V. Calero N. Keresztes G. Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Hopp J.A. Kolesnikov A.V. Chen C.K. Lem J. Heller S. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PDZ domains are known to serve a large range of different adaptor-type functions, influencing the activity and/or targeting of their interacting partners (25van Ham M. Hendriks W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2003; 30: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The roles of the DEP and PDZ domains in the P-Rex proteins are unknown. Finally, P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 also have a weak homology over their COOH-terminal half to inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase (1Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase is an enzyme that catalyzes the 4′-dephosphorylation of inositol (3,4)-bisphosphate, inositol (1,3,4)-trisphosphate, and PtdIns(3,4)-bisphosphate (26Norris F.A.

It regulates the survival of several types of neurons in the cerebellum and hippocampus (27Nystuen A. Legare M.E. Shultz L.D. Frankel W.N.

Although the residues required for phosphatase activity are present in the inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase homology (IP4P) domain of P-Rex1 and P-Rex2, we have so far not been able to demonstrate any phosphatase activity. Here, we have studied the mechanisms of regulation of P-Rex1 Rac-GEF activity by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and by Gβγ subunits through the generation and characterization of a panel of P-Rex1 deletion, truncation, and point mutants. Materials—Recombinant EE-Rac1 and EE-Gβ1γ2 subunits were produced in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, purified using their EE-tag, and stored as described previously (1Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J.

Generation of Mutant P-Rex1 Proteins—We have constructed a panel of human P-Rex1 proteins consisting of WT P-Rex1 and eight mutant proteins (Fig. 1). The design of the E56A/N238A point mutations (“GEF-dead” construct) was based on alignments of the DH domain with those of other Rac-GEFs. Glu56 in P-Rex1 is equivalent to Glu1047 in Tiam1 and Asn238 in P-Rex1 to Asn1232 in Tiam1 (14Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Both residues in Tiam1 are involved in building the interface with Rac, and their mutation to alanine disrupts Tiam Rac-GEF activity (14Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The E56A/N238A P-Rex1 construct was cloned using mutagenic primers. The design of the other mutants was based on domain boundary predictions made with SMART and PFAM programs. P-Rex1 lacking the PH domain (ΔPH), P-Rex1 lacking both DEP domains (ΔDEP), and P-Rex1 lacking both PDZ domains (ΔPDZ) were constructed with a short linker (STPSTS) to join the sequence preceding and following the deleted domains. The isolated PH domain (iPH) and the isolated IP4P domain (iIP4P) were cloned with a 5′-flanking in-frame EcoRI site and methionine start codon, and with a 3′-flanking stop codon and XbaI restriction site. The isolated DH/PH domain tandem (iDHPH) and P-Rex1 lacking the IP4P domain (ΔIP4P) are COOH-terminal deletions that were cloned with a 3′-flanking stop codon and XbaI restriction site.Fig. 1Panel of P-Rex1 mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutations were made by standard PCR protocols, and constructs were cloned into pBluescript and sequenced. Constructs were subcloned into pAcoG1 (which gives them an NH2-terminal EE-epitope tag) for production of recombinant proteins in Sf9 cells. WT and mutant P-Rex1 proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells by baculovirus infection, purified from Sf9 cells using their EE tag, and stored in phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Na azide, 50% glycerol, and 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Rac-GEF Activity Assay—Sf9 cell-derived purified human recombinant WT and mutant P-Rex1 proteins were assayed for Rac-GEF activity in vitro essentially as described previously (1Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 nm GDP-loaded purified recombinant Sf9 cell-derived EE-tagged Rac1 was incubated with 50 nm P-Rex1 protein, [35S]GTPγS, and liposomes (comprised of 200 μm each of phosphatidylcholine, -serine, and -inositol) that either did or did not contain varying concentrations of synthetic d/d-stearoyl-arachidonyl-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or purified recombinant Sf9 cell-derived Gβ1γ2 subunits. Rac was then immunoprecipitated using its EE-tag and its [35S]GTPγS loading was measured. To control for the fact that cholate (from the Gβγ subunit storage buffer) inhibits P-Rex1 Rac-GEF activity, mock stimulations were performed for each Gβγ concentration with the equivalent cholate buffer control. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Binding Assay—PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to Sf9 cell-derived purified human recombinant WT and mutant P-Rex1 proteins was measured using an assay derived from a protocol we have previously used to identify many PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding proteins (30Krugmann S. Anderson K.E. Ridley S.H. Risso N. McGregor A. Coadwell J. Davidson K. Eguinoa A. Ellson C.D. Lipp P. Manifava M. Ktistakis N. Painter G. Thuring J.W. Cooper M.A. Lim Z.Y. Holmes A.B. Dove S.K.

For this, P-Rex1 proteins were pre-cleared with Affi-Gel beads in assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg ml–1 fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) and then incubated at 60 nm final concentration with or without 20 μm d/d- or l/l-dipalmitoyl-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in assay buffer on ice for 15 min. The samples were then added to d/d-dipalmitoyl-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-coupled Affi-Gel beads or control Affi-Gel beads and incubated for 40 min at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Beads were washed four times in assay buffer before addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were detected by SDS-PAGE followed by anti-EE Western blotting. P-Rex1 Mutagenesis—To study the activation of P-Rex1 by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and Gβγ subunits, we constructed a panel of deletion, truncation, and point mutants of human P-Rex1. The panel consisted of WT P-Rex1; P-Rex1 with two point mutations, E56A and N238A, in the catalytic DH domain (GEF-dead mutant); P-Rex1 lacking the PH domain (ΔPH mutant); P-Rex1 lacking both DEP domains (ΔDEP mutant); P-Rex1 lacking both PDZ domains (ΔPDZ mutant); P-Rex1 lacking the IP4P domain (ΔIP4P mutant); the isolated IP4P domain (iIP4P mutant); the isolated DH/PH domain tandem (iDHPH mutant); and the isolated PH domain (iPH mutant) (Fig. 1). The WT and mutant P-Rex1 proteins were produced as recombinant NH2-terminal EE epitope-tagged proteins in Sf9 cells and purified using their EE tag. All P-Rex1 proteins were expressed at their expected sizes, WT P-Rex1 and the GEF-dead mutant at 185 kDa, the ΔPH mutant at 170 kDa, the ΔDEP mutant at 166 kDa, the ΔPDZ mutant at 168 kDa, the ΔIP4P and iIP4P mutants at 93 kDa, the iDHPH mutant at 45 kDa, and the iPH mutant at 15 kDa (Fig. 2). Regulation of P-Rex1 Basal Rac-GEF Activity—First, we assayed the basal in vitro Rac-GEF activity of WT P-Rex1 and of those mutant P-Rex1 proteins that contain the DH domain, by measuring GTPγS loading of Rac (Fig. 3). In the absence of any stimulus, WT P-Rex1 catalyzed the GTPγS loading of only a limited amount of Rac (2% of the total Rac in the assay in 10 min), as expected. The P-Rex1 protein with the E56A/N238A double mutation in the DH domain was catalytically inactive, confirming formally that the DH domain of P-Rex1 is indeed the catalytic site and that it behaves like a DH domain typical for GEFs of Rho family GTPases. The ΔPH mutant had 10 times elevated basal activity compared with WT P-Rex1, which shows that, in the absence of any stimulus, the PH domain helps to keep the WT enzyme in an inactive state. However, removal of all domains COOH-terminal to the PH domain, leaving just the DH/PH domain tandem (iDHPH), created a highly constitutively active protein. Titration of the amount of iDHPH protein in the assay suggested that its basal activity was at least 60 times that of WT P-Rex1. Hence, the PH domain is not sufficient to negatively regulate the basal activity of P-Rex1, i.e. additional regulation clearly comes from other parts of the WT enzyme. Indeed, ΔDEP and ΔPDZ mutants also had 5 and 15 times elevated basal activities, respectively, showing that the DEP and PDZ domains participate in keeping the WT enzyme in an inactive basal state. In contrast, removal of the COOH-terminal half of P-Rex1, which is largely occupied by the IP4P domain (ΔIP4P mutant) did not significantly change the basal Rac-GEF activity of P-Rex1 (but see below). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent Regulation of P-Rex1 Rac-GEF Activity—Next, we measured the direct PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent stimulation of the in vitro Rac-GEF activities of WT P-Rex1 and of those mutant P-Rex1 proteins that contain the DH domain, using as stimulus d/d-stearoyl/arachidonyl-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the naturally occurring form of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 4). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 had no effect on the GTPγS loading of Rac in the absence of any GEF protein. In contrast, the Rac-GEF activity of WT P-Rex1 was directly stimulated more than 30-fold by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal activation at concentrations above 10 μm and an EC50 of about 1.5 μm. This is similar to the effects we described in our original report on P-Rex1 (1Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). As expected, the E56A/N238A double mutant could not be activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, confirming again that it is GEF activity dead. Importantly, the elevated basal activity of the ΔPH protein could not be further stimulated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, whereas that of the iDHPH mutant could (when the latter was titrated down 12-fold to be within the range of our assay). These results show that the PH domain is necessary and the DH/PH tandem sufficient for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent regulation of P-Rex1 Rac-GEF activity. The Rac-GEF activities of all other P-Rex1 mutants, including those with elevated basal activities, could also be stimulated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The EC50 values of their stimulation by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were similar to that of WT P-Rex1, between 0.3 and 1.2 μm (with these slight differences unlikely to be significant), and their maximal activation by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was also similar to WT P-Rex1, all catalyzing GTPγS loading of around 60% of the total Rac in the assay within 10 min. Only the ΔIP4P mutant was significantly less active (GTPγS loading 30% of Rac within 10 min), suggesting that the presence of the IP4P domain in WT P-Rex1 might somehow promote full-scale PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent stimulation. However, another more mundane explanation for its reduced activity could be that the IP4P mutant has simply come out of its purification procedure with slightly lower specific activity. In any event, the IP4P domain plays at best a modulatory role in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent stimulation of P-Rex1. In summary, apart from the PH domain, none of the other P-Rex1 domains contribute fundamentally to the stimulation of P-Rex1 Rac-GEF activity by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. We made one additional interesting observation in this series of experiments: PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was inhibitory for the Rac-GEF activities of both mutants lacking the IP4P domain, the iDH/PH and ΔIP4P proteins, at concentrations above 3 μm. The suspected lower specific activity of the ΔIP4P protein (see above) cannot account for the striking difference in the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 dose-response curve of this mutant compared with WT. This result suggests that the presence of the IP4P domain might serve to prevent inactivation of the WT P-Rex1 enzyme at high PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 concentrations. Gβγ Subunit-dependent Regulation of P-Rex1 Rac-GEF Activity—Next, we assayed the Gβγ subunit-dependent stimulation of the in vitro Rac-GEF activities of WT P-Rex1 and those mutant P-Rex1 proteins that contain the DH domain, using purified recombinant Sf9 cell-derived Gβ1γ2 subunits as stimulus (Fig. 5). In this series of experiments, GEF activities were inhibited by the cholate in the Gβγ storage buffer, so we performed cholate buffer controls throughout, and we normalized results to the basal activity of WT P-Rex1 to allow direct comparison of all mutants. Gβγ subunits activated Rac to a limited extent in the absence of any GEF (about 7% of the total Rac in the assay in 10 min). In contrast, the Rac-GEF activity of WT P-Rex1 was strongly and directly stimulated by Gβγ subunits. The activation was 30-fold at 0.3 μm Gβγ subunits, similar to that described in our original report on P-Rex1 (1Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We did not attempt to determine EC50 values for Gβγ subunit-dependent Rac-GEF activity, as even the highest Gβγ subunit concentrations we could achieve in our assay were non-saturating. As expected, the E56A/N238A GEF-dead mutant could not be activated by Gβγ subunits. Surprisingly, the Rac-GEF activities of all other mutants could. Notably, both the iDHPH mutant and the ΔPH mutant, having only the DH domain in common, were activated by Gβγ subunits to a similar degree as WT P-Rex1. This surprising result infers that the DH domain mediates Gβγ subunit-dependent regulation of P-Rex1 Rac-GEF activity. The lower degree of activation observed with ΔDEP and ΔPDZ mutants (about half and one-third of WT P-Rex1 activity, respectively, at 0.3 μm Gβγ subunits) might indicate that these domains have a moderate modulatory effect on Gβγ subunit-dependent activation of WT P-Rex1 Rac-GEF activity. In contrast, the seemingly much lower activation of Rac by the ΔIP4P mutant is certainly an underestimate, created in part by its relatively low basal activity in thi"

Using an in vitro model, we provide an understanding of the events leading to estrogen-induced apoptosis in cells of spermatogenic lineage. Early events associated with estrogen exposure were up-regulation of FasL and increased generation of H2O2, superoxide, and nitric oxide. The ability of anti-FasL antibodies to prevent several downstream biochemical changes and cell death induced by 17β-estradiol substantiates the involvement of the cell death receptor pathway. Evidence for the amplification of the death-inducing signals through mitochondria was obtained from the transient mitochondrial hyperpolarization observed after estradiol exposure resulting in cytochrome c release. A combination of nitric oxide and superoxide but not H2O2 was responsible for the mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Mn(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride, an intracellular peroxynitrite scavenger, was able to reduce mitochondrial hyperpolarization and cell death. Although nitric oxide augmentation occurred through an increase in the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, superoxide up-regulation was a product of estradiol metabolism. All of the above changes were mediated through an estrogen receptor-based mechanism because tamoxifen, the estrogen receptor modulator, was able to rescue the cells from estrogen-induced alterations.

The significance of estrogen effects on the male reproductive system is of great interest because of the demonstration of impaired fertility in mice lacking estrogen receptor-α (1Korach K.S.

Endocrinol. 2003; 1: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Another important reason for the increased attention on the role of estrogens in male reproduction stems from various reports of estrogen exposure in the environment having a detrimental effect on male reproductive development and health (6Toppari J. Skakkebaek N.E. Baillieres Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 12: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Sharpe R.M. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 136: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Because estrogen receptors are present on spermatogenic cells, agents able to mimic the hormone can potentially bind to its receptor, leading to functional impairment of the male gamete. This hypothesis is validated by reports of lowered fertility rates in wildlife populations as a consequence of exposure to agents with estrogenic activity, termed endocrine disruptors (8Colborn T. vom Saal F.S. Soto A.M. Environ. Health Perspect. 1993; 101: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (2996) Google Scholar, 9Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, observations suggest that exposure to estrogens and estrogen-like chemicals interferes with testicular steroidogenesis (10Fukuzawa N.H. Ohsako S. Nagano R. Sakaue M. Baba T. Aoki Y. Tohyama C. Toxicol. in Vitro. 2003; 17: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and neonatal exposure ensures disturbances of puberty onset (11Atanassova N. McKinnell C. Turner K.J.

Bisphenol A, considered an environmental estrogen, exerts detrimental effects on mouse testis (12Kabuto H. Amakawa M. Shishibori T. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), creates interference with rat testicular steroidogenesis (13Akingbemi B.T. Ge R. Klinefelter G.R. Zirkin B.R. Hardy M.P.

Reprod. Toxicol. 2003; 17: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As evident from the above studies, the effect of estrogen on spermatogenesis is amply indicated in the literature; however, the understanding of a direct action of the hormone on spermatogenic cells is virtually nonexistent. This is because estrogen administration in vivo interferes with the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, and observed changes would be the result of testosterone deprivation rather than a direct effect of estrogen on the spermatogenic cells. Taken together, the effect of estrogens on testicular function provides a conceptual basis to examine the speculative link between increased exposure to environmental estrogens and reduced fertility. Estrogens act primarily through nuclear estrogen receptors, where binding of hormone and receptor brings about conformational changes, thus enabling the estrogen to recruit transcriptional coactivators that regulate gene expression leading to the control of a variety of functions (5Hess R.A. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2003; 1: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Effects of estrogens vary for different cell types ranging from induction of cell proliferation (15Weichselbaum R.R. Hellman S. Piro A.J. Nove J.J. Little J.B. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 2339-2342PubMed Google Scholar) to initiation of apoptosis (16Kushner P.J. Hort E. Shine J. Baxter J.D. Greene G.L. Mol.

Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).

Selection of the apoptotic pathway depends on the physiological and pathological state of the cells.

Swerdloff R.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21Print C.G. Loveland K.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Although earlier studies implicated FasL of Sertoli cell source for engaging Fas receptors on spermatogenic cells for apoptosis induction (21Print C.G. Loveland K.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), later studies provided evidence in support of both Fas and FasL being expressed in spermatogenic cells as well (22Nair R. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6470-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23D'Alessio A. Riccioli A. Lauretti P. Padula F. Muciaccia B. De Cesaris P. Filippini A. Nagata S. Ziparo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3316-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), thereby raising the possibility that FasL of spermatogenic cell source might be the ligand for Fas expressed on the various cell types of spermatogenic origin. Up-regulation of Fas and FasL in response to estrogens in adult rat testis resulting in the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells was shown in an earlier report from this laboratory, but the consequences of any direct estrogen action on spermatogenic cells could not be deciphered from this investigation (22Nair R. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6470-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The relationship between estrogen and FasL is not clear. In the normal ovary, FasL expression increases during high estrogen periods (24Sapi E. Brown W.D. Aschkenazi S. Lim C. Munoz A. Kacinski B.M. Rutherford T. Mor G. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 2002; 9: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas thymic atrophy resulting from estrogen treatment occurs via an increase in FasL expression (25Mor G. Sapi E. Abrahams V.M. Rutherford T. Song J. Hao X.Y. Muzaffar S. Kohen F. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) thereby indicating a relationship between increased FasL and estrogen. It is believed that the Fas-FasL system is responsible for maintaining the proper cell number in the testis during spermatogenesis (26Koji T. Hishikawa Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2003; 66: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but the role of estrogen in Fas-FasL regulation during normal spermatogenesis is not known. Estrogens show diverse effects on cells, and there is an intimate relationship between them and reactive oxygen species (ROS). 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; AG, aminoguanidine; CM-H2DCFDA, (5- (and 6-)chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate); DAF-FM, 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential; E2, estradiol; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FIU, fluorescence intensity units; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; JC-1, (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide); MnT-BAP, Mn(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; NO, nitric oxide; PI, propidium iodide; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; Z-LETD-FMK, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone.1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; AG, aminoguanidine; CM-H2DCFDA, (5- (and 6-)chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate); DAF-FM, 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein diacetate; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential; E2, estradiol; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FIU, fluorescence intensity units; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; JC-1, (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide); MnT-BAP, Mn(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; NO, nitric oxide; PI, propidium iodide; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; Z-LETD-FMK, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-Thr-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone. The hormones are able to generate ROS through redox cycling of their semiquinone derivatives (27Farinati F. Cardin R. Bortolami M. Grottola A. Manno M. Colantoni A. Villa E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 193: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and these ROS can cause considerable damage to cells (28Djavaheri-Mergny M. Wietzerbin J. Besancon F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2558-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fas-FasL ligation is also capable of generating ROS, and this ROS production occurs prior to caspase-8 activation in B cell lymphomas (29Devadas S. Hinshaw J.A. Zaritskaya L. Williams M.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 648-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and monocytes (30Perez-Cruz I. Carcamo J.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 2003; 102: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in murine intestinal epithelial and PC12 cells oxidative stress is able to induce expression of Fas-FasL (31Denning T.L. Takaishi H. Crowe S.E. Boldogh I. Jevnikar A. Ernst P.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is not known whether ROS is generated in spermatogenic cells in response to estrogens or whether there is any interplay between Fas-FasL ligation and ROS. Data on responses of spermatogenic cells to estrogens are scanty, and the relationship between the various changes that estrogen receptor-ligand interaction would incur in these cells and the functional consequences need to be explored. The present study was designed to investigate (i) the early changes that occur as a result of a direct estrogen action on the cells of spermatogenic lineage and (ii) the functional consequences of such changes. We provide an understanding of the critical events that occur after estradiol exposure to spermatogenic cells which lead to the activation of both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Materials—The Apoptosis Detection System was procured from Promega (Madison, WI). Primary and secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). For color development, a Vector Immuno Peroxidase substrate kit for Western blots was procured from Vector Laboratories Inc.

JC-1, CM-H2DCFDA, DAF-FM, the Vybrant apoptosis assay kit, the Griess reagent kit, the Enz-Check® caspase-3 assay kit, and SNAP were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). TRIzol reagent was from Invitrogen. MnTBAP was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-Leu-Glu-Thr-Asp-FMK (Z-LETD-FMK) was purchased from MP Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). Tamoxifen and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Animals—Adult male Wistar rats (Rattus rattus) were obtained from the Small Animal Facility of the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi. Wild type C57BL/6 (B6) and B6.MRL.lpr (B6-lpr,lpr) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained at the Small Animal Facility of the National Institute of Immunology following standards specified by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) of the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi. Euthanasia of rats was carried out by CO2 inhalation as specified by the IAEC, and testes were collected for the preparation of spermatogenic cells. Treatments—Spermatogenic cells cultures in Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 14.2 mm sodium bicarbonate, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10-7m testosterone, and 1% bovine serum albumin were treated with 10-8m 17β-estradiol. The dilutions of 17β-estradiol were made in sterile double distilled water because this estradiol was water-soluble (Sigma). Tamoxifen was dissolved in ethanol, and dilutions were made in culture media at the time of experimentation to arrive at a dose of 10 nm. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, was dissolved in culture medium, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. NAC was used at a concentration of 20 μm, and cells were either preincubated with NAC prior to 17β-estradiol exposure, or NAC was added at different time points after initiation of 17β-estradiol treatment. Aminoguanidine (AG), the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, was dissolved in sterile double distilled water and used at a concentration of 50 μm. It was either added 2 h prior to the addition of 17β-estradiol or added again at 4 h after 17β-estradiol exposure was initiated. MnTBAP (dissolved in sterile double distilled water) was used as a scavenger of peroxynitrite at a dosage of 100 μm. To generate superoxide, cells were placed in medium containing 50 μm xanthine, and 0.05 μm xanthine oxidase prepared in culture medium was added to start superoxide generation. For production of nitric oxide (NO), SNAP dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the cell suspension at a dosage of 4 μm. For all additions controls received equal amounts of vehicle. Preparation of Cells—Spermatogenic cells were prepared according to Meistrich et al. (32Meistrich M.L. Longtin J. Brock W.A. Grimes Jr., S.R. Mace M.L. Biol. Reprod. 1981; 25: 1065-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) with slight modifications as described previously (22Nair R. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6470-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Rao A.V. Shaha C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, decapsulated rat testes were finely chopped in spermatogenic cell culture medium, and the cells were subjected to serial filtration through nitex mesh (1,000 and 20 μm), Mira cloth, and glass wool. The resultant suspension was centrifuged and resuspended, and flow cytometry was used to check the cell preparation as described earlier (22Nair R. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6470-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Rao A.V. Shaha C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cytosol—Briefly, 108 spermatogenic cells were suspended in a buffer containing 150 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 5 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (1.6 mg/ml benzamidine HCl, 1 mg/ml phenanthroline, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by nitrogen cavitation (450 pounds/square inch for 30 min at 4 °C) with constant stirring. The lysate was centrifuged sequentially at 500 and 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei, respectively. The supernatant obtained was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Optima XL-100K ultracentrifuge (Beckman) to obtain cell cytosol. Reverse Transcription-PCR for FasL—Reverse transcription-PCR was carried out as described previously (22Nair R. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6470-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from spermatogenic cells after completion of various treatments using TRIzol reagent. First strand complementary DNA was made using 1–5 μg of total RNA in the presence of AmpliTaq Gold reverse transcriptase and random primer. After the reverse transcription, 1 μl of incubation mixture was used as a template for the subsequent PCR. Primer sets used as a template to obtain PCR products of FasL were 5′-AGCCCGTGAATTACCCATGTC-3′ and 5′-TGCTGGGGTTGGCTATTTGCT-3′ and for β-actin were 5′-AGGCATCCTGACCCTGAAGTAC-3′ and 5′-TCTTCATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAG-3′. All PCRs were performed for 30 cycles with an annealing temperature of 55–65 °C in 1.5 mm MgCl2. TUNEL Staining—Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) to detect DNA fragmentation was carried out using a TUNEL assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (33Rao A.V. Shaha C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and postfixation permeabilization was carried out with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation with buffer containing nucleotide mix (50 μm fluorescein-12-dUTP, 100 μm dATP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) for 1 h at 37 °C. TdT labeling was either measured by flow cytometry or visualized by microscopy. Visualization of Phosphatidylserine Exposure—Annexin-V labeling was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions using a Vybrant apoptosis assay kit. Briefly, cells after the respective treatments were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer and suspended in annexin-V binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, 700 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated for 15 min with annexin-V conjugated to Alexa Fluor and 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI). Subsequently, cells were washed and resuspended in the same buffer. Microscopy—All samples for microscopy were analyzed with a Nikon Confocal microscope C1 using argon laser (488 nm) for green fluorescence of annexin-Alexa Fluor, DAF-FM and H2DCFDA. For red and blue dyes, a red HeNe laser (543 nm) and a blue-diode laser (408 nm), respectively, were used for scanning PI and Hoechst-stained samples. Nomarski images were recorded in the transmission mode. Flow Cytometry—Cells (106) from different experimental groups were run on an EPICS Elite ESP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) equipped with a 15-mV, 488-nm air-cooled argon ion laser and 325-nm HeCd laser. The optimized instrument parameters were as follows: for forward scatter, voltage 100 mV, gain 30; for side scatter, voltage 400 mV, gain 30; for fluorescence 1 (Alexa Fluor/FITC), voltage 500 mV, mode log; fluorescence 3 (PI), voltage 550 mV, mode log; fluorescence 5 (Hoechst), voltage 560 mV, mode linear. Cells were isolated from fragments by gating on the forward and side scatter signals, and then cells were detected and analyzed according to their relative fluorescence intensities compared with unstained cells. Analyses were performed on 100,000 gated events, and numeric data were processed using WinMDI shareware version 2.8. Nitrite Estimation—Nitrite estimation was carried out using a Griess reagent kit. Briefly, supernatants of spermatogenic cell culture for various treatment groups were collected at different time points and mixed with Griess reagent and incubated at room temperature. Nitrite standard solutions were prepared as per the manufacturer's protocol and mixed with Griess reagent. Absorbance was measured at 548 nm in a microplate reader (μ-quant, Biotek Instruments). Nitrite concentrations (nmol/106 cells) were calculated from the standard curve. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured using JC-1 probe (34Dey R. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7087-7094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). JC-1 is a cationic mitochondrial vital dye that is lipophilic and becomes concentrated in the mitochondria in proportion to the membrane potential; more dye accumulates in mitochondria with greater ΔΨm and ATP generating capacity. Therefore, the fluorescence of JC-1 can be considered as an indicator of relative mitochondrial energy state. The dye exists as a monomer at low concentrations (emission, 530 nm, green fluorescence) but at higher concentrations forms J-aggregates (emission, 590 nm, red fluorescence). Briefly, cells were labeled for 10 min with 10 μm JC-1 at 37 °C, washed, resuspended in medium, and fluorescence was recorded at two different wavelengths as mentioned above. The ratio of the reading at 590 nm to the reading at 530 nm (590:530 ratio) was considered as the relative ΔΨm value. Measurement of ROS—For measurement of H2O2, the cell permeant probe CM-H2DCFDA was used. Although it detects hydroxyl radical, the half-life of the radical being short means that the primary detection is that of H2O2 (35Duranteau J. Chandel N.S. Kulisz A. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11619-11624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). CM-H2DCFDA is a nonpolar compound that readily diffuses into cells, where it is hydrolyzed to the nonfluorescent derivative dichlorodihydrofluorescein and trapped within the cells. In the presence of a proper oxidant, dichlorodihydrofluorescein is oxidized to the highly fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescein. The dye was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and dilutions were made in culture medium. Briefly, cells (107) were suspended in medium containing 2 μg/ml CM-H2DCFDA for 15 min in the dark, and various treatments were initiated. Fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm over a period of time. For superoxide anion detection, OxyBURST reagent was used following the protocol described by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells (107) were loaded with OxyBURST Green H2HFF-bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 min, and relative fluorescence was monitored for OxyBURST at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm over a period of time. For NO, typically, 107 cells were loaded with 1 μm fluorescence probe DAF-FM for 30 min, washed, and treatments were initiated after which NO generation was monitored at an excitation of 485 nm and emission at 515 nm. For each experiment, fluorometric measurements were performed in triplicate and expressed as fluorescence intensity units (FIU). All measurements were carried out in a Fluostar Optima spectrofluorometer (BMG Technologies, Offenburg, Germany) or using a LS-50B luminescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) and analyzed using an FL Winlab software package. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysate proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels and subjected to Western blot analysis for FasL detection as described previously (36Aravinda S. Gopalakrishnan B. Dey C.S. Totey S.M. Pawshe C.H. Salunke D. Kaur K. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15675-15685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For cytochrome c and caspase-8 detection, 10% polyacrylamide gel was used, but for iNOS, 7.5% polyacrylamide gel was required. All primary antibodies were diluted to 1:1,500 except anti-FasL, which was diluted to 1:2,000; for secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at 1:5,000 dilution was used. Reactive bands were visualized by using a Vector Immuno Peroxidase substrate kit. Statistical Analysis—Paired comparisons of the data were conducted using a paired t test, and all data are presented at mean values ± S.E. Differences were considered significant at a 0.05 level of confidence. Spermatogenic Cell Death Occurs after 17β-Estradiol Exposure in Vitro—Fig. 1A, a and b, shows flow cytometric analyses of the cell preparation used for this study. The percentages of haploid and diploid cells were 80 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 1Aa). Fig. 1Ab is a representation of the cell population on a dot plot to identify the various cell types. Among the diploid cells represented as black dots, there are two distinct populations, a population with 4C DNA content representing spermatocytes and a population with 2C DNA content comprising of secondary spermatocytes and spermatogonia. Secondary spermatocyte numbers being very low in the testis, the 2C population primarily represents the spermatogonia. Postmeiotic haploid cells with the 1C DNA amount represented as gray dots were identifiable separately from the other two groups and consisted of the largest population representing spermatids (Fig. 1Ab). Under the microscope, the size, shape, and chromatin pattern of nuclei, the presence of metaphase figures, and the presence of the acrosomal cap were used to identify the cell types. Fig. 1Ac shows the Nomarski photomicrograph of the cell population used for the studies, and Fig. 1Ad is the Nomarski recording overlapped with Hoechst staining, which clearly shows the nuclear material making identification easier. Pachytene spermatocytes were the largest cells with a typical dispersed chromatin; round spermatids were clearly distinguishable by their acrosomal caps and spermatogonia by size and sp"
https://openalex.org/W2018996401,"Epithelial cell transforming protein 2 (Ect2) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho GTPases, molecular switches essential for the control of cytokinesis in mammalian cells. Aside from the canonical Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology cassette found in virtually all Dbl family members, Ect2 contains N-terminal tandem BRCT domains. In this study, we address the role of the Ect2 BRCT domains in the regulation of Ect2 activity and cytokinesis. First, we show that the depletion of endogenous Ect2 by small interfering RNA induces multinucleation, suggesting that Ect2 is required for cytokinesis. In addition, we provide evidence that Ect2 normally exists in an inactive conformation, which is at least partially due to an intramolecular interaction between the BRCT domains and the C-terminal domain of Ect2. This intramolecular interaction masks the catalytic domain responsible for guanine nucleotide exchange toward RhoA. Consistent with a role in regulating Ect2 GEF activity, overexpression of an N-terminal Ect2 containing the tandem BRCT domains, but not single BRCT domain or BRCT domain mutant, leads to a failure in cytokinesis. Surprisingly, although ectopically expressed wild-type Ect2 rescues the multinucleation resulting from the depletion of endogenous Ect2, expression of a BRCT mutant of Ect2 failed to restore proper cytokinesis in these cells. Taken together, the results of our study indicate that the tandem BRCT domains of Ect2 play dual roles in the regulation of Ect2. Whereas these domains negatively regulate Ect2 GEF activity in interphase cells, they are also required for the proper function of Ect2 during cytokinesis.

Whereas these domains negatively regulate Ect2 GEF activity in interphase cells, they are also required for the proper function of Ect2 during cytokinesis. The small Rho GTPase is known to play important roles in essential cellular processes such as the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, gene transcription, cell motility, cell adhesion, and cytokinesis (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar, 2Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases function as molecular switches cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. This cycle is controlled by several regulatory proteins including guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; Ect2, epithelial cell transforming protein 2.1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; Ect2, epithelial cell transforming protein 2. that facilitate the release of GDP from Rho GTPase, GTPase-activating proteins that catalyze GTP hydrolysis, and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors that sequester Rho GTPases in the cytosol and thereby inhibit guanine nucleotide exchange (3Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Of the two families of Rho GEFs, the Dbl domain-containing family is by far the larger one, with over 60 members identified in the human genome (4Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). These Dbl GEFs contain a common catalytic domain designated the Dbl homology (DH) domain. In addition to the DH domain, most Dbl family members also contain a distal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that is necessary for their GEF activities (5Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ect2 is a Dbl family member that possesses a DH/PH cassette and mediates the guanine nucleotide exchange of Rho GTPases (7Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It was initially identified as a proto-oncogene able to induce transformation when transfected in epithelial cells (8Miki T. Smith C.L. Long J.E. Eva A. Fleming T.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Similar to other Dbl family proteins, the transforming activity of Ect2 was the result of an N-terminal deletion (9Saito S. Liu X.F. Kamijo K. Raziuddin R. Tatsumoto T. Okamoto I. Chen X. Lee C.C.

The N terminus of Ect2 contains tandem repeats of the BRCT domain, a motif that was first described at the C terminus of the breast cancer susceptibility gene product, BRCA1, and is conserved in many proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoint and DNA damage response (11Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). It is not yet known how these tandem BRCT repeats regulate Ect2 activity in vivo. Previous studies have suggested an important role of Ect2 in the regulation of cytokinesis, the last step of cell division partitioning the cytoplasm and the cell cortex to form two daughter cells (12Glotzer M.

In addition, overexpression of human Ect2 N terminus, which contains the tandem BRCT motifs but not the DH/PH domain, leads to multinucleation (7Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T.

In this study, we examined the regulatory roles of the Ect2 BRCT domains. We identified an autoinhibitory interaction between the BRCT and DH/PH domains of the Ect2 protein. The release of this autoinhibitory interaction is imperative for the binding and activation of Rho GTPase. Interestingly, the Ect2 BRCT domains also play a positive role and are required for proper cytokinesis in vivo. Constructs—Human Ect2 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. T. Miki (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). FLAG-tagged full-length and deletion fragments were subcloned into pIRES-EGFP mammalian expression vector. The BRCT W210R and W304R mutants were created with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pcDNA3-based full-length and C terminus of Ect2 constructs were generated for in vitro translation studies. Wild-type or mutant Ect2 fragments containing residues 1–341 were subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 vector for the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. GST-fused RhoA and GST-RhoA N-19 constructs were kindly provided by Dr. D. D. Billadeau (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Purification of Recombinant Proteins in E. coli—E. coli expressing the indicated GST fusion proteins were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% Triton X-100 and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was then pelleted by centrifugation, and the remaining supernatant was incubated with glutathione 4B-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h with rotation. The beads were pelleted and washed with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). GST fusion proteins were eluted with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, buffer containing 20 mm glutathione and dialyzed against PBS. The integrity of purified proteins was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. Antibodies—Rabbit anti-Ect2 antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with GST-Ect2 containing amino acids 112–341. Anti-Ect2 antibody was affinity-purified using the AminoLink Plus Immobilization and Purification Kit (Pierce). Anti-RhoA and anti-GST antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-HA antibody from Covance, and anti-FLAG, anti-α-tubulin, and anti-actin antibody were obtained from Sigma. Small Interfering RNA—Ect2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was synthesized by Dharmacon Inc. The siRNA duplexes were 21 base pairs as follows: Ect2-siRNA sense strand, 5′-CAAGAGUGAUAUUGGUUCAdTdT; and control siRNA sense strand, UUCAAUAAAUUCUUGAGGUdTdT. Transfection of siRNA duplexes was performed using Oligofectamine reagent as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (v/v). Cell transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in NETN buffer containing 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin and aprotinin at 4 °C for 10 min. Crude lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and supernatants were incubated with protein G-Sepharose-conjugated anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. The immunocomplexes were washed twice with NETN buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed following standard procedures. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, cells were blocked with 5% goat serum for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies recognizing Ect2, RhoA, or tubulin at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoReserach Laboratories, Inc.) at room temperature for 1 h. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. After a final wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted with glycerin containing p-phenylenediamine. All images were obtained with a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 fluorescence microscope. GST Pull-down Assay—GST pull-down experiments were performed by incubating immobilized GST-N-terminal Ect2 with various in vitro translated Ect2 proteins. GST-Ect2 was expressed in E. coli and then purified following the procedure described above. pcDNA-Ect2 encoding the full-length, N terminus, or C terminus construct was in vitro translated using the TNT® T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h in NETN buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In Vitro RhoA Binding Assay—293T cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged expression constructs encoding the full length, BRCT mutant, or C terminus of Ect2 were allowed to grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, transfected cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet-P40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin and aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The immobilized GST-RhoA GST-RhoA N-19 was incubated with cell lysates in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin and aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4) at 4 °C for 20 min. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer containing 1% Nonidet-P40, and the bound material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In Vitro GDP/GTP Exchange Assay—Guanine nucleotide exchange assays were performed as described previously (18Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged expression constructs encoding the full length, BRCT mutant, or C terminus of Ect2 were lysed in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) was added to cell lysate, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle mixing. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with exchange buffer and subjected to GDP/GTP exchange assays. The RhoA-[3H]GDP complex was prepared by incubation of RhoA with 0.5 μm [3H]GDP (Amersham Biosciences) in exchange buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2,10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 20 min followed by the addition of 8 mm MgCl2 to terminate the GDP/GTP exchange reaction. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with the RhoA-[3H]GDP complex at room temperature with 1 mm GTP. After incubation for specified periods, ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2) was added, and the samples were filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore), which was subjected to extensive washing with wash buffer. The radioactivity that remained on the filter was quantified by a liquid scintillation counter. Ect2 Is Involved in Cytokinesis—Previous studies have implicated a role for Ect2 in transformation and the regulation of cell division. In fact, whereas overexpression of the C-terminal portion of Ect2 containing the DH/PH cassette leads to transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (9Saito S. Liu X.F. Kamijo K. Raziuddin R. Tatsumoto T.

Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 16Kimura K. Tsuji T. Takada Y. Miki T. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2003; 90: 819-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that Ect2 may act as a critical regulator of cell cycle progression. To gain insight into the role of endogenous Ect2 in cell cycle regulation, we depleted Ect2 using siRNA. Ect2 expression was significantly down-regulated in HeLa cells by Ect2 siRNA (Fig. 1A). We monitored cell morphology in Ect2 siRNA-transfected cells by immunofluorescence staining with anti-Ect2 and anti-actin antibodies (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, the number of multinucleated cells substantially increased in Ect2 siRNA-transfected cells, demonstrating that Ect2 is required for cytokinesis. BRCT Domain of Ect2 Is Responsible for Intramolecular Interaction between the N Terminus and C Terminus of Ect2, not for Intermolecular Oligomerization of Ect2—Ect2 is a Rho GEF whose exchange activity increases in mitosis, coincident with its hyperphosphorylation in M phase (7Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear mechanistically how the regulation of Ect2 GEF activity is achieved. Many of the well-characterized Dbl family members exist in an inactive or partially active state through intramolecular or intermolecular interactions that are subsequently released after stimulation (4Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 19Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The previous observations that overexpression of either the N or C terminus of Ect2 showed different effects on cell cycle regulation suggested a potential mechanism of autoinhibition of Ect2 activity through intramolecular interaction. To test this hypothesis, we employed a GST pull-down assay using the bacterially expressed GST-Ect2-N terminus containing the tandem BRCT domains to detect a potential interaction with the C-terminal half of the Ect2 molecule, which was translated in vitro. Consistent with our hypothesis, GST-Ect2-N spanning amino acids 1–341 interacted with full-length Ect2 (F; amino acids 1–882) and the C terminus of Ect2 (C; amino acids 342–882), but not with Ect2-N itself (N) (Fig. 2A), whereas the GST control did not bind to any of the three fragments. This indicates that the N terminus of Ect2 physically interacts with the C terminus of Ect2 that contains the DH/PH module. Next, we sought to determine whether the intact structure of the BRCT domains at the N terminus of Ect2 is required for this intramolecular interaction. To answer this question, a GST fusion protein of Ect2 encompassing only the tandem BRCT repeats (amino acids 112–341) was used for the pull-down assay as described above. This shortened N terminus of Ect2 also showed a strong interaction with the C terminus of Ect2 (data not shown). To confirm that the BRCT domain mediates this intramolecular interaction, a point mutation (W304R) was introduced into the BRCT domain by replacing a highly conserved tryptophan with arginine in the α3 helix of BRCT domain (11Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) that is involved in the folding of BRCT domains (20Zhang X. Morera S. Bates P.A. Whitehead P.C. Coffer A.I. Hainbucher K. Nash R.A. Sternberg M.J. Lindahl T. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6404-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Unlike wild-type GST-Ect2-N, the GST-Ect2-N-W304R mutant was unable to interact with either full-length or C-terminal Ect2 protein (Fig. 2A), indicating that the intact BRCT domains of Ect2 are critical for this intramolecular interaction. The other regulatory mode of Dbl family members involves oligomerization through an intermolecular interaction, as suggested by studies of RasGRF, Dbl, Lsc, and p115RhoGEF (21Anborgh P.H. Qian X.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30975-30984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We tested the potential oligomerization of Ect2 by transient co-transfection of 293T cells with FLAG- and HA-tagged full-length Ect2 constructs. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies recognizing the FLAG epitope showed a specific co-precipitation of HA-tagged Ect2, demonstrating that Ect2 can exist as oligomers in vivo (Fig. 2B). We next examined whether this homo-oligomerization of Ect2 is dependent on the BRCT domain of Ect2. As shown in Fig. 2B, the BRCT mutant of Ect2 (F-W304R) still has the ability to oligomerize in vivo. As a whole, these data indicate that the BRCT domain is required for the intramolecular interaction, but not for the intermolecular oligomerization of Ect2. The Release of Autoinhibition by BRCT Mutation Opens Up the Ect2 Catalytic Domain toward RhoA—The above-characterized intramolecular interaction mediated by the BRCT domain between the N terminus and C terminus of Ect2 raised the possibility that the release of this interaction might lead to the activation of Ect2 by exposing the catalytic domain of Ect2 to a Rho GTPase. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 have all been suggested as substrates of Ect2 in vitro and in vivo (7Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 10Solski P.A. Wilder R.S. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Cox A.D. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25226-25233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the Drosophila Ect2 homolog Pebble interacts only with Rho1, and not with Rac1 or Cdc42 (15Prokopenko S.N. Brumby A. O'Keefe L. Prior L. He Y. Saint R. Bellen H.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2301-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Moreover, siRNAs targeting pbl or Rho1 lead to multinucleation, whereas siRNA targeting Rac1 or Cdc42 does not show such a phenotype (25Somers W.G. Saint R. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study demonstrated the localization of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 during cytokinesis (26Minoshima Y. Kawashima T. Hirose K. Tonozuka Y. Kawajiri A. Bao Y.C. Deng X. Tatsuka M. Narumiya S. May Jr., W.S. Nosaka T. Semba K. Inoue T. Satoh T. Inagaki M. Kitamura T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Rac1 was aligned along the central spindle, and Cdc42 seemed to be encircled by the equatorial ring, whereas only RhoA was positioned in the midbody around the equatorial ring, a pattern similar to that of Ect2. To determine whether RhoA is associated with Ect2 during cytokinesis in vivo, we compared the localization pattern of RhoA with that of Ect2 during cytokinesis by morphologically examining the staining pattern of Ect2 and RhoA with anti-α-tubulin staining that serves as a midbody marker. Indeed, Ect2 co-localized with RhoA at the midbody (Fig. 3A). Based on these data, we focused on RhoA and tested whether or not the BRCT mutant of Ect2, which loses an intramolecular interaction, should allow the catalytic domain of Ect2 to be open and interact more strongly with a dominant negative RhoA, RhoA-N19. GST or GST-RhoA N-19 was incubated with cell lysates prepared from 293T cells that were transfected with either the full-length construct (F), the BRCT domain mutant (F-W304R), or a truncation mutant containing the DH/PH cassette (C). The Ect2-C containing the catalytic domain formed a strong complex with GST-RhoA-N19, whereas the wild-type Ect2-F did not bind RhoA in this assay. However, Ect2-F-W304R demonstrated increased interaction with RhoA (Fig. 3B). This supports our model that BRCT mutation abolishes the intramolecular interaction between the N terminus and C terminus of Ect2 (Fig. 2A) and thus allows the binding of the catalytic domain with RhoA (Fig. 3B). To further confirm that the release of the intramolecular interaction results in increased GEF activity of Ect2, we examined the biochemical activity of wild-type and mutant Ect2 to catalyze the exchange of GDP to GTP in vitro. GST-RhoA was loaded with [3H]GDP and subsequently incubated with immunoprecipitated complexes from 293T cells expressing the wild-type (F), the BRCT domain mutant (F-W304R), or the constitutively active version of Ect2 (C). As shown in Fig. 3C, the release of GDP was measured over time. The constitutively active Ect2-C significantly catalyzed the release of GDP from RhoA over the time course examined. In contrast, the wild-type Ect2 did not demonstrate any detectable GEF activity, whereas the Ect2-F-W304R mutant exerted increased GEF activity. These results again support that the release of the intramolecular interaction imposed by the BRCT domain exposes the Ect2 catalytic domain and thus increases the GEF activity of Ect2 toward RhoA. The Tandem BRCT Domains Are Responsible for the Multinucleation Phenotype Observed in Cells Overexpressing the N Terminus of Ect2—Our data suggest that the BRCT domains of Ect2 participate in the negative regulation of Ect2 GEF activity in part through a mechanism of autoinhibition. Next, we sought to clarify the biological role of the Ect2 BRCT domains and their potential role in the regulation of cytokinesis in vivo. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or various mutants of FLAG-tagged, EGFP-tagged Ect2 (Fig. 4A). Expression of wild-type or mutant Ect2 was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4B). 72 h after transfection, multinucleated cells were determined in EGFP-positive transfectants (Fig. 4C). We confirmed that overexpression of the N terminus of Ect2 containing the tandem BRCT domains (N2) led to multinucleation, whereas these phenotypic changes were not observed in cells transfected with vector alone, or in cells overexpressing either full-length Ect2 (F) or the C terminus of Ect2 (C) (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, the multinucleation phenotype induced by overexpression of the Ect2-N2 fragment was totally abolished by introduction of the W304R mutation in the N2 fragment, demonstrating that the intact BRCT domain is required for multinucleation phenotype (Fig. 4D). Notably, the overexpression of N-terminal Ect2 without BRCT II domain (N1) also showed no defect in cytokinesis (Fig. 4D). From these data, we conclude that the ability of the N terminus of Ect2 to induce the multinucleated phenotype depends on the tandem BRCT domains. The BRCT Domain Is Essential for Ect2 Biological Activity during Cytokinesis—Our findings suggest that the tandem BRCT domains of Ect2 function as a single unit in controlling cytokinesis at least in part through negative regulation of the Ect2 GEF activity. If the tandem BRCT domains of Ect2 are involved only in the negative regulation, we would expect that these domains would be dispensable for Ect2 activity in cytokinesis in vivo. To test this, we transfected HeLa cells with a vector control or siRNA-resistant versions of the wild-type (F) or BRCT mutant of Ect2 (F-W304R). We subsequently transfected these cells with Ect2 siRNA and then checked the expression level of endogenous and exogenous Ect2 by either anti-Ect2 antibody (data not shown) or anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5A). The endogenous Ect2 was completely depleted by siRNA transfection. However, siRNA-resistant Ect2-F and Ect2-F-W304R were still expressed in these cells. We quantified the percentages of multinucleated cells in each transfection. Similar to that shown above in Fig. 1C, depletion of Ect2 results in a substantial increase of multinucleated cells (Fig. 5B). Strikingly, although the multinucleated phenotype could be rescued by the expression of wild-type Ect2, the BRCT domain mutant failed to restore normal cytokinesis (Fig. 5B). These data strongly suggest that the tandem BRCT domains are not only involved in negatively regulating Ect2 GEF activity but also are essential for the biological activity of Ect2 in cytokinesis. The present study demonstrates that the tandem BRCT domains of Ect2 play an essential role in regulating the biochemical and biological activities of Ect2. Ect2 is required for proper cytokinesis, as evidenced by the high level of multinucleation in cells treated with Ect2 siRNA (Fig. 1). The N-terminal BRCT domains mediate an intramolecular interaction between the N terminus and C terminus of Ect2 (Fig. 2A) but are dispensable for the homo-oligomerization of Ect2 (Fig. 2B). Whereas the BRCT domains play an autoinhibitory role in the regulation of Ect2 GEF activity toward RhoA (Fig. 3), they are also required for proper cytokinesis (Fig. 5). Overall, these findings suggest that the tandem BRCT domains play both negative and positive roles in regulating Ect2 activity in vivo. Many of the Dbl family members are regulated through a negative intramolecular interaction that is relieved after specific signaling events resulting in phosphorylation (e.g. Vav and proto-Dbl) or protein binding (e.g. Asef and p115RhoGEF) (27Aghazadeh B.

The GEF activity of Ect2 is regulated by a similar mechanism. As shown in our study, the tandem BRCT domains of Ect2 block the catalytic domain of Ect2 through an intramolecular interaction. Indeed, Ect2 protein immunoprecipitated from unsynchronized cells, in which most of the cells are in interphase, shows little GEF activity, suggesting that Ect2 exists mainly in an inactive oligomeric form during interphase (Fig. 6). In mitosis, Ect2 is activated and required for cytokinesis. However, little is known about how Ect2 is activated during mitosis. Although the phosphorylation of Ect2 in mitosis correlates with the increased GEF activity of Ect2, it is not yet known whether Ect2 phosphorylation is the cause or the consequence of conformational changes leading to the increased GEF activity. Similar to Asef or p115RhoGEF, the biological activity of Ect2 may also be controlled through the recruitment of additional protein(s) that binds directly to Ect2 and thus relieves its intramolecular autoinhibition (Fig. 6). Future studies are needed to further elucidate the mechanism by which the intramolecular inhibition of Ect2 is relieved during mitosis. Ect2 activity may also be regulated by intermolecular interaction through Ect2 oligomerization. For example, oligomerization of RasGRF1 and RasGRF2 through the DH domain (21Anborgh P.H. Qian X. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. DeClue J.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4611-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), oligomerization of Dbl through the DH domain (22Zhu K. Debreceni B. Bi F. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), oligomerization of Lsc through the coiled-coil domain in the C terminus of Lsc (24Eisenhaure T.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30975-30984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and oligomerization of p115RhoGEF through the C-terminal tail of p115RhoGEF (23Chikumi H. Barac A. Behbahani B. Gao Y. Teramoto H. Zheng Y. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have been reported previously. Oligomerization of these GEFs is important for augmenting the activation of GTPase by recruiting multiple Rho GTPases into the same signaling complex. We have shown here that Ect2 can also form oligomers. However, unlike the intramolecular interaction, the Ect2 BRCT domain is not required for this intermolecular oligomerization. It remains to be determined whether the oligomerization of Ect2 is regulated and whether this property of Ect2 is also essential for the function of Ect2 in cytokinesis. The activated Ect2 catalyzes the exchange of GDP to GTP and thus activates Rho GTPase during mitosis. However, this study indicates that the increase of Ect2 GEF activity alone is not sufficient for the proper completion of cytokinesis. This is based on our observation that a full-length Ect2 BRCT domain mutant, which still retains GEF activity in vitro and can oligomerize in vivo, failed to rescue the multinucleation phenotype in Ect2 siRNA-treated cells. We propose that the tandem BRCT domains may bind additional partner that is prerequisite for the faithful completion of cytokinesis (Fig. 6). We have shown that overexpression of the N terminus of Ect2 has a dominant negative effect in cytokinesis. This effect may be partially due to the exogenous Ect2 BRCT domains competing with endogenous Ect2 for the binding of the Ect2 BRCT domain-binding partner that is needed for cytokinesis. Therefore, the identification of such Ect2 BRCT domain-binding partner(s) will be critical for understanding of the role of Ect2 in the regulation of cytokinesis. We are grateful to Dr. Michael J. Hamann for providing constructs and helpful discussion. We also thank members of the Chen laboratory for discussion and Katherine Minter-Dykhouse, Jamie Wood, and Irene M.

Furthermore, Twist-overexpressing MCF-7 cells displayed a deregulated p53 response to γ-radiation and decreased regulation of downstream target genes. Using a p53-promoter-reporter system, we demonstrated that HOXA5 could partially restore the inhibitory effects of Twist on p53 target genes. These effects are likely mediated through both the transcriptional up-regulation of p53 and the protein-protein interaction between HOXA5 and Twist. Thus, the loss of HOXA5 expression could lead to the functional activation of Twist resulting in aberrant cell cycle regulation and promoting breast carcinogenesis. The homeotic gene HOXA5 has been shown to play an important role in breast tumorigenesis.

The HOX 1The abbreviations used are: HOX, homeotic; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA. family of homeobox-containing genes encodes transcription factors that are highly conserved from Drosophila to Homo sapiens (1Carroll S.B.

Transcription factors encoded by the HOX genes are essential for maintaining the positional identity of cells along the major body axis. Activation of HOX genes establishes a developmental guide that remains conserved throughout development (1Carroll S.B. Nature. 1995; 376: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 2Reichert H. Simeone A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3Galant R.

Failure of the molecular systems that control development results in a prevention of normal embryo growth and disruptions in this control system have been shown to be involved in a wide variety of cancers (4Buske C.

Several studies have linked HOX function to neoplastic growth, where translocations involving HOX genes were shown to be the underlying cause of leukemias and lymphomas (8Armstrong S.A. Staunton J.E. Silverman L.B. den Pieters R. Boer M.L. Minden M.D. Sallan S.E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 9Feldman B.J. Hampton T.

Blood. 2002; 99: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Selected HOX genes have been shown to be differentially expressed in neoplasms of the colon, lung, kidney, and breast, but their functional relationship to the neoplastic phenotype remains to be elucidated (11Cillo C. Cantile M. Faiella A. Boncinelli E. J. Cell Physiol. 2001; 188: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We have shown that HOXA5 expression is higher in normal breast epithelium than in breast carcinomas (7Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Seeking a functional role for HOXA5, we observed consensus HOX binding sites within the p53 promoter and showed that HOXA5 is a potent transactivator of the p53 promoter. In an effort to identify protein-protein interacting partners of HOXA5, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen that identified Twist as an interacting partner. Twist was initially discovered as a gene required for the formation of mesodermal patterns in early Drosophila zygotic development (12Bate M. Rushton E. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1993; 316: 1047-1061PubMed Google Scholar, 13Baylies M.K. Bate M. Science. 1996; 272: 1481-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The Twist protein belongs to the family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that exert their activity as transactivating factors through dimer formation (14Castanon I. Baylies M.K. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 287: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Twist gene can give rise to Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease, which results in craniosynostosis (15Chun K. Teebi A.S. Jung J.H. Kennedy S. Laframboise R.

Mutat. 2000; 15: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the helix domain of the Twist gene can cause subcellular mislocalization and increased degradation of its protein product (18El Ghouzzi V. Le Merrer M. Perrin-Schmitt F. Lajeunie E. Benit P. Renier D. Bourgeois P. Bolcato-Bellemin A.L. Munnich A. Bonaventure J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), which results in the repression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression (19Sosic D. Richardson J.A. Yu K. Ornitz D.M. Olson E.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 169-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that Twist can be involved with several pathways that lead to the formation of cancer by: halting differentiation, controlling apoptosis, interfering with the p53 tumor suppressor pathway (20Maestro R. Dei Tos A.P. Hamamori Y. Krasnokutsky S. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Doglioni C. Beach D.H. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and inducing an epithelial-mesenchymal-like transition (21Yang J. Mani S.A. Donaher J.L. Ramaswamy S. Itzykson R.A. Come C. Savagner P. Gitelman I. Richardson A. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). Twist can also bind to p300 and decrease its histone acetyltransferase activity (22Hamamori Y. Sartorelli V. Ogryzko V. Puri P.L. Wu H.Y. Wang J.Y. Nakatani Y. Kedes L. Cell. 1999; 96: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is established that homeobox and basic helix-loop-helix containing proteins interact in different organisms (23Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Poulin G. Lebel M. Chamberland M. Paradis F.W. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, the HOXA5-Twist interaction fits this class of interactions and taken together the above results indicate that it may play a role in carcinogenesis. We have previously shown that HOXA5 protein binds to the p53 promoter and activates p53 expression (7Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Twist has been shown to reduce the activity of the p53 promoter as well as the production of p19 ARF mRNA (20Maestro R. Dei Tos A.P. Hamamori Y. Krasnokutsky S. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Doglioni C. Beach D.H. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that the addition of HOXA5 to MCF-7 cells stably transfected with Twist largely reverses the Twist-mediated suppression on p53 target sequences. Furthermore, Twist overexpression in MCF-7 cells alters p53 phosphorylation and cell cycle progression in response to radiation an effect that can partially be reversed by a Twist-specific small interfering RNA. Plasmid Construction for Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Full-length HOXA5 gene was released (EcoRI digest) from the parental plasmid (25Crooks G.M. Fuller J. Petersen D. Izadi P. Malik P. Pattengale P.K. Kohn D.B. Gasson J.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 519-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ligated into pAS2-1 (Clontech) creating pAS2-1-HOXA5. Truncated HOXA5 vector, designated pAS2ΔHOX, devoid of homeodomain was generated by digesting the full-length HOXA5 with BspHI, end filling, EcoRI digestion, and ligating into pAS2--1. PCR was used to generate the N/C-terminal deletion construct (ΔNC, i.e. Δamino acids 81–187), which was ligated into the appropriate sites of pAS2-1 and used for the two-hybrid screen. For delineation of protein binding sites of HOXA5 and Twist, the appropriate coding sequences were inserted into pBD-GAL4 Cam and pAD-GAL4–2.1 (Stratagene), respectively. The use of these vectors enabled us to prepare C-terminal deletion constructs of pBD-ΔNC and pAD-Twist using the Erase-a-Base system as described by the manufacturer (Promega). All pBD-ΔNC and pAD-Twist plasmids were isolated and sequenced. pAD-Lamin C (Clontech) and pAD SV40T (Clontech) were co-transformed with pBD-p53 (Clontech) and served as negative and positive controls for the yeast two-hybrid assay, respectively. Yeast Two-hybrid System—The Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used for the interaction assays. To screen for proteins that interact with HOXA5, a human brain cDNA library and an E 7.5 mouse embryonic library in Gal4-AD vector pACT2 were screened, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Clontech), using ΔNC cloned in pAS2-1 as bait. Subsequently, individual plasmids were used to transform Y190 yeast cells to establish positive binding. Plasmid Construction for Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Binding Assays—The HOXA5 insert was cloned into the pGEX-6P1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to yield the plasmid pGEX-HOXA5. Plasmid pGEX-HOXA5ΔC was generated by digesting the parent plasmid pAS2ΔHOX (as described above) and the pGEX-6P1 vector with EcoRI-SalI and ligating the ΔHOX insert to the purified pGEX-6P1 vector. Plasmid pGEX-HOXA5ΔCP was generated by digesting pGEX-HOXA5 with BglII and SalI. The vector containing the HOXA5ΔCP fragment was blunt-ended and self-ligated. Plasmid pCR3.1-HOXA5 was generated by inserting FLAG-HOXA5 into an EcoRI-linearized pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Twist gene, released from plasmid pCMV-Twist (20Maestro R. Dei Tos A.P. Hamamori Y. Krasnokutsky S. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Doglioni C. Beach D.H. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), was cloned into the BamHI- and SalI-digested pGEX-6P1 vector to generate pGEX-Twist. GST Binding Assays, Immunoblotting, and 35S-Protein Labeling— GST protein affinity kits were used according to the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, pGEX-HOXA5, pGEX-HOXA5ΔC, pGEX-HOXA5ΔCP, pGEX-Twist, and empty pGEX-6P1 vector were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli, grown in 2YT medium (10 g of yeast extract, 16 g of tryptone, 5 g of NaCl) induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 1 h at 25 °C, and pelleted. Pellets were lysed with B-PER reagent (Pierce), mixed with 50% slurry of Sepharose-GST beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the pellets were washed three times with PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 35S-labeled proteins, previously prepared using the T7 transcription and translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT RRL) kit, as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Immobilized protein-protein complexes were washed three times with PBS, and samples were resuspended in a reducing urea-containing buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using HOXA5, Twist, and GST antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using MCF-7 extracts. Briefly, the cells were washed, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% TritonX-100, and 0.1% SDS), and precleared using preimmune serum and recombinant protein A (Pierce). To the clear lysate, 5 μg of the respective antibody was added per 500 μg of protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, recombinant protein A was added and incubated for an additional 2 h. Subsequently, the resin was washed 10 times in wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), resuspended in urea-containing SDS-PAGE buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HOXA5 and Twist. Immunofluorescence—MCF-7 cells (2 × 104) were plated onto collagen treated 4-well chamber glass slides (Lab-Tek) and transfected with FLAG-HOXA5 and Myc-Twist plasmids or with pCR3.1 vector alone. After 24 h, cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum. After incubating with primary antibodies for HOXA5 (mouse anti-FLAG at 1:1000, Stratagene) and Twist (rabbit anti-Myc 1:500, Panvera) the samples were incubated with donkey fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) and a donkey Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) and examined using a Nikon TS-100 fluorescence microscope.

Mirus Trans-IT-LT1 polyamine reagent was used for MCF-7 and HCT116 p53-/- (a gift of Dr. Bert Vogelstein; Ref. 27Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W.

MCF-7 cells were cultured in modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and HCT116 p53-/- cells in McCoy's 5A medium-modified (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stably expressing cell lines were selected and maintained by growth in the presence of G418 (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 500 μg/ml. Irradiation Experiments and Laser Scanning Cytometry—Cells were irradiated at 0.78 Gy/min to the desired dose (10 Gy) using a γ cell 40 137cesium irradiator (Atomic Energy of Canada). For laser scanning cytometry cells were harvested at 0, 12, and 24 h post-irradiation. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and resuspended in a solution containing 0.56% Nonidet P-40, 3.7% formaldehyde, and 0.01% Hoechst 33258 in PBS. Laser scanning cytometry was performed using a BD Biosciences LSR. Transfections of siRNA Duplexes into MCF-Twist Cells—The sense and antisense strands of Twist siRNA (sense, 5′-GAUGGCAAGCUGCAGCUAUdTdT-3′; antisense, 5′-AUAGCUGCAGCUUGCCAUCdTdT-3′) were denatured and annealed to a final concentration of 20 μm. 1 × 105 MCF-7Myc-Twist cells (50% confluence) were transfected using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) complexed with Twist siRNA or control siRNA, respectively. Following transfection, the proteins were extracted at 24 and 48 h post-incubation and analyzed for Twist and p53 protein levels by Western blotting. HOXA5 Interacts with Twist—In an effort to identify the mechanisms by which loss of HOXA5 may promote tumorigenesis in breast cancer, we performed yeast two-hybrid analysis to isolate HOXA5 interacting proteins. As bait we used a HOXA5 deletion construct (ΔNC, amino acids 81–187), which is devoid of any inherent transcriptional activity (Fig. 1A). From these experiments, we identified four potential HOXA5 binding partners, including the anti-apoptotic protein referred to as Twist. The interaction of HOXA5 with Twist was confirmed using individual clones in a yeast two-hybrid genetic analysis (data not shown). To verify the interaction in the yeast environment, ΔNC and full-length Twist were cloned in the similar yeast-two hybrid vectors pBD-GAL4 Cam and pAD-GAL4–2.1 (Stratagene). Yeast-two hybrid analysis using these constructs also verified the interaction between ΔNC and Twist (Fig. 1B). To identify the regions of the proteins responsible for this interaction, deletion mutagenesis was performed on pBD-ΔNC and pAD-Twist. The deletion mutants generated were assayed for binding using a yeast two-hybrid approach, and results are summarized in Fig. 1B. These results indicated that the amino acids 81–105 of HOXA5 and amino acids 1–50 of Twist are necessary and sufficient for interaction between HOXA5 and Twist. To confirm the interaction between HOXA5 and Twist, in vitro GST pull-down assays were performed. HOXA5, as well as C-terminal deletion constructs of HOXA5 (amino acids 1–187 and amino acids 1–176), were expressed as GST fusion proteins using standard GST expression and purification procedures in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Fig. 1C). Proteins expressed from GST-HOXA5 (full-length) and C-terminal deletion constructs were bound to in vitro transcribed and translated 35S-labeled Twist protein (Fig. 1C). Also, the pentapeptide motif (amino acids 177–181) of HOXA5, which has been shown to be an important site for protein-protein interactions (28Knoepfler P.S. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5811-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), was not critical for direct binding to the Twist protein (Figs. 1, B and C). In the converse experiment, GST-Twist fusion protein also interacted with the in vitro translated 35S-labeled HOXA5 (Fig. 1D). To verify this interaction in the breast cancer cellular environment, immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out in epithelial MCF-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1E, Twist and HOXA5 were pulled down using anti-HOXA5 and anti-Twist antibodies in MCF-7 cellular lysate. In addition, a control Co-IP with preimmune serum and anti-p21 antibody did not show any binding (Fig. 1E). From the results obtained, we have demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic protein HOXA5 interacts with Twist, a protein shown to down-regulate p53 functions. Furthermore, immunolocalization studies demonstrated that transiently transfected Myc-tagged Twist was predominantly localized in the nucleus of MCF-7 cells and less in the cytoplasm, while FLAG-HOXA5 was exclusively localized in the nucleus of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1F). These results show that HOXA5 and Twist may form protein-protein complexes in the nucleus of MCF-7 cells. Twist Compromises the p53 Response to γ-Radiation—The p53 response to exogenous stimuli, such as γ-radiation, leads to arrest at the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle (29Westphal C.H. Schmaltz C. Rowan S. Elson A. Fisher D.E. Leder P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1664-1667PubMed Google Scholar). A key effector of this response is a cdk inhibitor known as p21Waf1/Cip1, which also inhibits the Cyclin E-cdk2 complex from phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (30Cho J.W. Jeong Y.W. Kim K.S. Oh J.Y. Park J.C. Lee J.C. Baek W.K. Suh S.I. Suh M.H. Cell Prolif. 2001; 34: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). MCF-7, MCF-7Myc-epitope (vector control), and MCF-7Myc-Twist-overexpressing cells were subjected to γ-radiation (10 Gy) and analyzed for activation of the key p53 targets, MDM-2 and p21Waf1/Cip1 at 1, 2, and 4 h after irradiation (Fig. 2A). p53 levels were induced 1 h after irradiation, but maximum induction was observed 2 h after irradiation in non-transfected MCF-7 and MCF-7Myc-epitope expressing cells. p21Waf1/Cip1 and MDM-2 proteins were also markedly induced in both cell types 4 h following irradiation and 2 h after the highest p53 levels were observed. However, Twist-overexpressing cells showed a constant level of p53, no induction of p21Waf1/Cip1, and a reduced induction of MDM-2. It is interesting to note that Twist-overexpressing cells have a high level of endogenous p53 (prior to radiation). However, this p53 protein is probably repressed, as it did not activate p21Waf1/Cip1 or MDM-2 prior to radiation. The p53 function is likely to be repressed because the levels of p21Waf1/Cip1 and MDM-2 were comparable with those of control cells before radiation. We propose that the accumulated level of p53 is a result of a deregulated p53 response, which includes a reduced p53 turnover even prior to radiation. Moreover, the expression of Twist did not interfere with the down-regulation of p14ARF (data not shown) or the nuclear import of p53 (Fig. 2B) or the ability of p53 to be ubiquitinated in response to treatment with the proteosome inhibitor MG-132 (data not shown). To understand the implications of Twist overexpression on the cell cycle, MCF-7, MCF-7Myc-epitope, and MCF-7Myc-Twist cells were irradiated with 10 Gy and assayed for DNA content at 0, 12, and 24 h post-irradiation using laser scanning cytometry (Fig. 2C). MCF-7 and MCF-7Myc-epitope control cells were arrested 12 and 24 h after treatment predominantly at the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. However, Twist-overexpressing cells displayed an increased synthetic phase at 12 h after irradiation, while after 24 h they had reverted to the preirradiation cell cycle profile. Finally, knockdown of Twist expression by siRNA in MCF-7Myc-Twist cells resulted in a decreased amount of p53 protein (Fig. 2D). These data demonstrate that Twist overexpression provides a potent inhibition signal on p53 mediated gene expression. Twist overexpression also overrides cell cycle checkpoint arrest in response to ionizing radiation thereby demonstrating the potential oncogenic effects of Twist overexpression on cell cycle. Twist Alters p53 Serine 20 Phosporylation in Response to γ-Radiation—The p53 response to stimuli involves the stabilization of the p53 protein through post-translational modifications (32Alarcon-Vargas D. Ronai Z. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism by which Twist compromises the p53 response, we examined the phosphorylation of p53 serines 15 and 20 in Twist-overexpressing cells in response to γ-radiation. Phosphorylation of these residues has been previously shown to be important for p53-mediated apoptosis (33Saito S. Goodarzi A.A. Higashimoto Y. Noda Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Appella E. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12491-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 34Xie S. Wu H. Wang Q. Cogswell J.P. Husain I. Conn C. Stambrook P. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43305-43312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In MCF-7 and MCF-7Myc-epitope cells, p53 Ser15 was phosphorylated 120 min following 10 Gy of γ-radiation, while in MCF-7Myc-Twist cells p53 Ser15 was phosphorylated as early as 30 min following 10 Gy of γ-radiation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, p53 Ser20 was only phosphorylated in MCF-7 and MCF-7Myc-epitope control cells but not in MCF-7Myc-Twist cells (Fig. 3A). This altered p53 Ser20 phosphorylation in MCF-7Myc-Twist cells could be partially rescued by down-regulating Twist protein levels using Twist-specific siRNA (Fig. 3B). Prevention of phosphorylation of p53 Ser20 has been described previously with desferroxamine (35Ashcroft M. Taya Y. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in that study, desferroxamine inhibited the accumulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 and MDM-2, which, taken together with our results, may indicate an important role for the phosphorylation of Ser20 as a signal involved in regulating the p53 response. HOXA5 Reverses the p53-suppressive Effects of Twist—Because HOXA5 was previously shown to have a potential tumor suppressor role, we investigated whether it could reverse the oncogenic effects of Twist. A canonical p53 binding site linked to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 4A) was co-transfected with either pCR3.1 empty vector, a full-length HOXA5 expressing vector, or ΔNC expression vector. In each case Renilla luciferase expressing vector was used as an internal control. Transfections were in MCF-7, MCF-7Myc-epitope, and MCF-7Myc-Twist-overexpressing cells. The activity of the p53 minimal promoter in the absence of HOXA5 was significantly decreased (17-fold) in Twist-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4B), an event that demonstrated the severity of the inhibition of the endogenous p53 activity in Twist-overexpressing cells. HOXA5 addition increased the activity of p53 in all cell lines tested including the Twist-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4C). Addition of ΔNC, the HOXA5 construct that lacked the DNA binding homeodomain but retained Twist binding (Fig. 1B), to Twist-overexpressing cells induced p53 reporter activity by ∼3-fold (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that the increased p53 reporter activity by HOXA5 was, at least in part, due to the protein-protein interactions defined by the ΔNC construct. These data also demonstrated that the p53 protein could be functional in the presence of ectopic HOXA5 protein in Twist-overexpressing cells. To determine the ability of full-length HOXA5 to rescue Twist-mediated p53 suppression by virtue of the HOXA5-Twist protein-protein interaction, we co-transfected a combination of a p53 minimal promoter-luciferase, Renilla luciferase, HOXA5, and Twist expression plasmids into the human colon carcinoma cell line 379.2 (HCT 116 p53-/-). Overexpression of Twist resulted in suppression of p53 activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 4D) in accordance with similar results from experiments in mouse embryo fibroblasts (20Maestro R. Dei Tos A.P. Hamamori Y. Krasnokutsky S. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Doglioni C. Beach D.H. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2207-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of HOXA5, Twist-dependent repression of the p53-inducible promoter activity was partially alleviated. In the absence of the constitutively active p53 gene, neither HOXA5 (Fig. 4D) nor Twist (data not shown) were able to bind to or up-regulate the p53 reporter construct. These results demonstrated that HOXA5 might have the ability to augment p53 target gene expression because of its ability to bind to the Twist protein. Taken together these data indicate that HOXA5 may safeguard the p53 response by virtue of its direct interaction with Twist. Additionally, Twist may inhibit p53-mediated gene transcription through its demonstrated ability to inhibit p300-mediated acetylation (22Hamamori Y. Sartorelli V. Ogryzko V. Puri P.L. Wu H.Y.

Currently it is hypothesized that a ternary complex containing p53, MDM2, and p300 controls p53 protein stability (36Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S.

Overexpression of Twist and its increased binding to p300-p53 complexes may deregulate the finely balanced physiological p53 turnover and function.

Mechanical stretch in particular has been identified as a positive regulator of proliferation in skin keratinocytes and other cell systems. In the present study it was investigated whether antiapoptotic signaling is also stimulated by mechanical stretch. It was demonstrated that mechanical stretch rapidly induced the phosphorylation of the proto-oncogene protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt at both phosphorylation sites (serine 473/threonine 308) in different epithelial cells (HaCaT, A-431, and human embryonic kidney-293). Blocking of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase by selective inhibitors (LY-294002 and wortmannin) abrogated the stretch-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore mechanical stretch stimulated phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the formation of EGFR membrane clusters. Functional blocking of EGFR phosphorylation by either selective inhibitors (AG1478 and PD168393) or dominant-negative expression suppressed stretch-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Finally, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) was shown to induce positive transactivation of EGFR in response to cell stretch. These findings define a novel signaling pathway of mechanical stretch, namely the activation of PKB/Akt by transactivation of EGFR via angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Evidence is provided that stretch-induced activation of PKB/Akt protects cells against induced apoptosis. Mechanical stress is known to modulate fundamental events such as cell life and death.

Evidence is provided that stretch-induced activation of PKB/Akt protects cells against induced apoptosis. The application of mechanical forces is a ubiquitous challenge to skin cells. Both differentiation processes and proliferation can be induced by different qualities of mechanical stimulation. In vitro studies have demonstrated that mechanical pressure gives rise to differentiation processes (1Bernd A. Ramirez-Bosca A. Görmar F.E. Bereiter-Hahn J. Holzmann H. Eur. J. Dermatol. 1992; 2: 450-451Google Scholar, 2Görmar F.E. Bernd A. Bereiter-Hahn J. Holzmann H. Bernd A. Bereiter-Hahn J. Hevert F. Holzmann H.

These findings fit the in vivo situation where mechanical pressure provokes horny skin formation, and mechanical stretch, as present in abdominal stretching during pregnancy, induces skin enlargement. Previous in vitro studies on human skin keratinocytes have shown that mechanical stretch induces proliferation-associated signaling cascades of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (4Kippenberger S.

Particularly the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 may have functional aspects in stretch-mediated proliferation. As initial events in mechanotransduction, surface receptors of the integrin family are thought to recognize mechanical energy and transduce it into biological signals (6Ingber D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 7Ingber D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). This assumption is supported by the finding that blocking of β1 integrins abrogates stretch-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (4Kippenberger S. Bernd A. Loitsch S.

In particular, the antiapoptotic kinase PKB 1The abbreviations used are: PKB, protein kinase B; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; AT1-R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGFα, transforming growth factor α.1The abbreviations used are: PKB, protein kinase B; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; AT1-R, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGFα, transforming growth factor α./Akt is a candidate signaling molecule shown to play a key role in suppression of apoptotic cell death (8Franke T.F.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Prototypically, PKB/Akt activation is transduced by cell surface receptors in response to insulin and mitogens such as epidermal growth factor (10Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

In addition, recent advances have shown that integrins, namely the β1 and β4 subsets, stimulate PKB/Akt phosphorylation and therefore may contribute to antiapoptosis (13Fornaro M. Steger C.A.

Proximal from surface receptors, the phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) conveys activation of PKB/Akt via phosphoinositide-dependent kinases. It has been demonstrated that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 phosphorylates PKB/Akt at threonine 308 (15Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Studies regarding the impact of mechanical stimuli on PKB/Akt have been mainly carried out in endothelium-derived cells as hemodynamic changes caused by coronary circulation are known to contribute to pathophysiological processes of the blood vessel system (18Dimmeler S.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 541: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this context, vascular smooth muscle cells may also respond to mechanical stretch by activation of PKB/Akt and therefore may contribute to the onset of proliferative disease of the vascular system (22Sedding D.G. Seay U. Fink L. Heil M. Kummer W. Tillmanns H. Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Circulation. 2003; 108: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that mechanical stress induced by therapeutic interventions such as stent implantation and balloon catheters contributes to the frequently observed restenosis (23Zhou R.H. Lee T.S. Tsou T.C. Rannou F. Li Y.S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 2015-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).In the present approach, it was found that PKB/Akt activation in response to mechanical stretch is also present in a keratinocyte model. Moreover the signaling events involved in the activation of PKB/Akt were identified. Transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by pertussis-sensitive GPCRs demonstrates a novel mechanism of PKB/Akt activation triggered by mechanical stretch.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were used. Phosphospecific antibodies raised against PKB/Akt (serine 473 and threonine 308) and an antibody against total PKB/Akt were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Antibodies raised against the activated form of the EGFR and total EGFR were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories and Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Detection of caspase 8 and 3 degradation was performed using antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. The PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002 and the specific inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, AG1478 and PD168393, were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Pertussis toxin from Bordetella pertussis to inactivate the α subunits in the Gi and Go subfamilies of heterotrimeric G proteins was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Losartan to block the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) was a kind gift from Merck Sharp and Dohme. The endothelin receptor antagonists BQ-123 and BQ-788 were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. The apoptosis inducer staurosporine was purchased from Roche Applied Science.Cell Culture—The spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) (a generous gift from Professor Fusenig, German Cancer Research Institute, Heidelberg, Germany) was cultured in carbonate buffered Hanks' medium with 5% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A-431 (American Type Culture Collection) and the human epithelial kidney line HEK-293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. All experiments were done in agreement with the local ethics commission.Mechanical Stimulation—Stretching of in vitro cultured cells was performed as described previously (4Kippenberger S. Bernd A.

Briefly, silicone elastomer MED-4011 (Armando Medizin Technik, Düsseldorf, Germany) was stirred, poured into preformed Teflon matrices, and allowed to polymerize. To allow cell attachment, silicone dishes were treated with 5.7% KOH in methanol for 5 min to neutralize the polymerization-derived HCl. After washing with double distilled water, silicone dishes were coated with 2% arginine for 2 h to facilitate cell attachment (24Karasek M.A. Curr. Probl. Dermatol. 1980; 10: 143-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and afterward rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, the dishes were incubated with fetal calf serum for 2 h. After withdrawal of the serum, cells were plated in flexible silicone chambers and incubated for 24 h under regular conditions. Prior to the application of mechanical stretch, the cells were held for 24 h under serum-free conditions. Then the silicone chambers were extended to 10% for 5 min. After stretch stimulation, cells were either fixed for immunocytochemistry, or protein samples were prepared at the indicated time intervals.Transfection—HEK-293 cells seeded in silicone dishes were transiently transfected with kinase-defective mutants of EGFR (K721A) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The construct was a kind gift from Josef Yarden, Weizman Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel (25Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26178-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because of a point mutation at position 721, Lys is replaced by Ala to inhibit the cytoplasmic kinase activity. After transfection, cells were allowed to synthesize proteins under regular conditions for 16 h. Before the application of mechanical stretch the cells were serum-starved for another 16 h.Immunoblotting—For detection of PKB/Akt and caspases 3 and 8, cells were lysed in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), sonicated, boiled for 5 min, and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For detection of EGFR, cells were scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated, and centrifuged. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined (Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit) and standardized using bovine serum albumin. 20 μg of protein were mixed with SDS sample buffer and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Then proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6), 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk) for at least 3 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6), 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% bovine serum albumin. The bound primary antibodies were detected using anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Stretched HaCaT cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The silicone dishes were cut into 1-cm2 squares, placed in plastic vessels, and incubated with the EGFR antibody diluted in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS, the silicone sheets were incubated with anti-goat-fluorescein isothiocyanate in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Finally the silicone sheets were rinsed three times with PBS, placed on glass slides, and examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS, Leica).RESULTSMechanical Stretch Induces Phosphorylation of PKB/Akt— HaCaT cells were seeded into flexible silicon chambers and inserted into a stretching unit as described previously (4Kippenberger S. Bernd A. Loitsch S. Guschel M. Müller J. Bereiter-Hahn J. Kaufmann R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cells were unidirectionally stretched to 10% for 5 min and after relaxation were scraped into SDS sample buffer after 0, 10, and 30 min, respectively. Protein extracts were tested for PKB/Akt phosphorylation by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1, mechanical stretch induced a rapid phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at both phosphorylation sites (threonine 308 and serine 473). The phosphorylation activity peaked between 10 and 30 min in the epithelial cell species tested.Inhibitors of PI3K Block PKB/Akt Phosphorylation in Response to Stretch—The role of PI3K was examined to elucidate the signal transduction pathways underlying the activation of PKB/Akt phosphorylation by mechanical stretch. There is a large body of evidence for the key role of PI3K in the activation of PKB/Akt in different cell systems (8Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 26Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). In our study the function of PI3K was blocked by two highly selective inhibitors (wortmannin and LY-294002). It was found that a pretreatment for 1 h with 20 μm LY-294002 completely blocked the stretch-induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt (Fig. 2, A and B). To substantiate this finding, cells were treated with wortmannin at 25, 50, and 100 nm (Fig. 2C). In the presence of wortmannin, the basal phosphorylation of PKB/Akt was suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4). Likewise, the stretch-induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt detected 10 and 20 min after stretch stimulation was reversed by increasing concentrations of wortmannin (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–12). These findings clearly demonstrate PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in response to mechanical stretch.Fig. 2Inhibitors of PI3K suppress stretch-mediated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt. A, serum-starved HaCaT cells were stretched for 5 min, and total protein was prepared at the indicated time intervals. Protein extracts were subjected to Western blot and tested for phosphorylation of PKB/Akt. B, cells were pretreated with PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 (20 μm) and then stretched as described in A. C, concentration-dependent effect of PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (25, 50, and 100 nm) on basal phosphorylation of PKB/Akt was tested in HaCaT cells (lanes 1–4). Additionally the effect of wortmannin on stretch-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation was tested in cell proteins extracted after 10 min (lanes 5–8) and 20 min (lanes 9–12), respectively.

Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 28Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

In the present model, the relevance of this signaling cascade for mechanotransduction was tested. Immunoblots demonstrated a rapid phosphorylation of EGFR in response to mechanical stretch (Fig. 3, A, lanes 1–3, and B, lanes 1–4). These data were further substantiated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The occurrence of EGFR clusters in response to mechanical stretch indicated functional activation (Fig. 3C). Furthermore it was studied whether the phosphorylation of EGFR in response to stretch is dependent on GPCR function. Therefore, cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin known to inactivate GPCR by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of α subunits in the Gi and Go subfamilies of heterotrimeric G proteins. In our model we could observe that pretreatment with pertussis toxin abolished the stretch-induced phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 3A). This finding gives evidence for a contribution of GPCRs to the transactivation of EGFR in response to mechanical stretch. Additionally, inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase by preincubation with 1 μm PD168393 blocked EGFR transactivation by mechanical stretch. The functional link between GPCRs, EGFR, and PKB/Akt was further corroborated by showing an inhibition of PKB/Akt by pertussis toxin (Fig. 4). To characterize the GPCR-mediated effect, different inhibitors against GPCR subsets were tested. Findings derived from a vascular smooth muscle cell model suggested that angiotensin and endothelin receptors partake in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in response to stretch (30Hosokawa H. Aiuchi S. Kambe T. Hagiwara Y. Kubo T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 1588-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In our experiments, losartan, an inhibitor of AT1-R, potently suppressed PKB/Akt phosphorylation in our model (Fig. 5A). Antagonists directed against the endothelin receptor subsets ET-AR and ET-BR (BQ-123 and BQ-788) showed no effect (Fig. 5B). These data give evidence that EGFR- and GPCR-signaling cascades cooperate in the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in mechanotransduction.Fig. 3Mechanical stretch stimulates phosphorylation of the EGFR; GPCR inhibitor pertussis toxin and EGFR kinase inhibitor PD168393 abrogate transactivation. A, serum-starved HaCaT cells were stretched for 5 min and extracted immediately (0 min) and 3 min after the stretching stimulus (lanes 1–3). Additionally cells were pretreated with 15 ng/ml GPCR inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX, lanes 4–6) for 12 h and then stretched according to the aforementioned protocol. Protein extracts were subjected to Western blot and tested for EGFR phosphorylation using a phosphospecific antibody. Equal loading was monitored by using antibodies directed against total EGFR. B, cells were pretreated with 1 μm EGFR kinase inhibitor PD168393 for 1 h and then stretched (lanes 5–8). Control activation of EGFR in response to mechanical stretch was confirmed (lanes 1–4). C, serum-starved HaCaT cells were stretched for 5 min, fixed, and hybridized with EGFR antibody. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody served as a secondary antibody.

In the following experiments, it was investigated whether phosphorylation of EGFR has functional implications for downstream PKB/Akt phosphorylation (Figs. 6, 7, 8). HaCaT cells were treated with AG1478, a specific inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, and then stretched (Fig. 6). The controls treated with solvent only showed the typical phosphorylation pattern of PKB/Akt (Fig. 6A). In contrast no phosphorylation of PKB/Akt was observed in cells treated with 50 nm AG1478 (Fig. 6B). To further confirm these findings, different concentrations of AG1478 were tested. In the absence of mechanical stretch AG1478 (10, 50, and 100 nm) had no effect on basal PKB/Akt phosphorylation at both phosphorylation sites (Fig. 6C). Only at 500 nm AG1478 was the basal phosphorylation of PKB/Akt attenuated. Fig. 6D shows the effect of increasing concentrations of AG1478 on stretch-induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt. After stretching the cells for 5 min the protein was extracted and tested for PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Only the stretch control showed a clear phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at both phosphorylation sites (Fig. 6D, lane 2). It was found that the stretch-induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt was suppressed by AG1478 in a concentration-dependent manner. At 10 nm AG1478, the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt was distinctly inhibited. At higher concentrations, this effect was more pronounced. To substantiate these findings another specific EGFR inhibitor was tested. Phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in response to mechanical stretch was completely abrogated in the presence of 500 nm PD168393 (Fig. 8A). In addition to pharmacological inhibition, ectopic expression of kinase-deficient EGFR (K721A) was tested. It was found that overexpression of K721A in HEK-293 cells attenuated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, corroborating the functional link between EGFR and PKB/Akt in the transmission of mechanical stretch (Fig. 8B).Fig. 6Inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine kinase by AG1478 abrogates stretch-mediated activation of PKB/Akt. A, serum-starved HaCaT cells without additional treatment were used as a positive control for PKB/Akt phosphorylation in response to mechanical stretch. Cells were stretched for 5 min, and total protein was prepared at the indicated time intervals and subjected to Western blot.

https://openalex.org/W2076959989,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α) plays crucial roles in tumor promotion by transactivating approximately 60 kinds of its target genes. Recently, we reported a novel splice variant HIF-1α785, which is regulated primarily by phorbol ester. This variant can be stabilized under normoxic conditions because it loses an acetylation site Lys532. Its expression was found to promote xenografted tumor growth in nude mice. We here found that the Ras oncogene regulates HIF-1α785 expression via the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, and that both phorbol ester and epidermal growth factor also induced HIF-1α785 via the same pathway. We also identified the nonhypoxic regulatory domain responsible for phorbol ester-induced HIF-1α785 expression. These results imply that HIF-1α785 may play an important role in tumor promotion mediated by the Ras oncogene, phorbol ester or tumor growth factors."

Selective aggregation of secretory granule constituents in an acidic, bivalent cation-rich environment is considered to be a prerequisite for sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. The effect of selective vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor bafilomycin A1 on the pH gradient along the secretory pathway was used here to study the role of acidification on the trafficking of the regulated secretory protein chromogranin A (CgA) in PC12 cells. Sorting of CgA was assessed by three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy, subcellular fractionation, and secretagogue-stimulated release, examining a series of full-length or truncated domains of human CgA (CgA-(1-115), CgA-(233-439)) fused to either green fluorescent protein or to a novel form of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (EAP). We show that a full-length CgA/EAP chimera is sorted to chromaffin granules for exocytosis. Inhibition of V-ATPase by bafilomycin A1 markedly reduced the secretagogue-stimulated release of CgA-EAP by perturbing sorting of the chimera (at the trans-Golgi network or immature secretory granule) rather than the late steps of exocytosis. The effect of bafilomycin A1 on CgA secretion depends on a sorting determinant located within the amino terminus (CgA-(1-115)) but not the C-terminal region of the granin. Moreover, examination of chromaffin granule abundance in PC12 cells exposed to bafilomycin A1 reveals a substantial decrease in the number of dense-core vesicles. We propose that a V-ATPase-mediated pH gradient in the secretory pathway is an important factor for the formation of dense-core granules by regulating the ability of CgA to form aggregates, a crucial step that may underlie the granulogenic function of the protein.

The regulated secretory pathway is characterized by the concentration of a selected (segregated) pool of secretory proteins into granules with a typical electron-dense appearance on transmission electron microscopy. These granules may remain in the cell for an extended period of time after their formation until prompted to undergo exocytotic fusion with the plasma membrane by a secretagogue characteristic for a particular cell type.Selective aggregation or condensation of secretory granule constituents in a mildly acidic environment and in the presence of millimolar concentrations of bivalent cations like Ca2+ is considered to be an important prerequisite for two proposed models of sorting within the regulated secretory pathway, namely sorting-for-entry and sorting-by-retention (2Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 3Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tooze S.A. Martens G.J. Huttner W.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 116-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the sorting-for-entry model, the lumen of the TGN serves as a unique trafficking station where selective aggregation of the secretory protein may take place followed by subsequent binding of the protein aggregate to the membrane of the budding secretory granule or to a sorting receptor therein. In the sorting-by-retention hypothesis sorting takes place in a secretory organelle distal to the TGN, the short-lived immature secretory granule, wherein selective aggregation/condensation of regulated secretory proteins occurs; non-retained proteins are then removed from maturing granules, possibly into a constitutive-like secretory pathway.Chromogranin A (CgA) belongs to the chromogranins/secretogranins (or “granins”) family of regulated secretory proteins, which are ubiquitously distributed in secretory granules of endocrine, neuroendocrine. and neuronal cells. Because of their widespread occurrence, granins and particularly CgA have often been used as model proteins to understand mechanisms of protein targeting into dense-core secretory granules (4Tooze S.A.

A large number of studies have shown that the proton gradient that exists within the cellular compartments that form the secretory pathway is established and maintained essentially by electrogenic vacuolar-type ATPase proton pumps (V-ATPase). Although several studies point to a contribution of TGN acidification to some aspects of secretory granule biogenesis in several neuroendocrine cell types, the ultimate role of V-ATPase-mediated acidification on the sorting and release of regulated secretory proteins in sympathoadrenal chromaffin cells is incompletely understood. Also, significant discrepancies have been reported on the effect of pH perturbation on the intracellular trafficking of regulated secretory proteins in neuroendocrine cells. For example, inhibition of V-ATPase in pituitary cells provoked intracellular accumulation of proopiomelanocortin and prolactin in large electron-dense vacuolar structures (19Henomatsu N. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Tashiro Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 127-139PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schoonderwoert V.T. Holthuis J.C. Tanaka S. Tooze S.A. Martens G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5646-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas other results obtained in the same cell type reported re-routing of prohormone convertase or proopiomelanocortin to the constitutive pathway of secretion (21Tanaka S. Yora T. Nakayama K. Inoue K. Kurosumi K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We previously reported that a CgA-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein expressed in PC12 cells is trafficked to dense-core secretory granules (22Taupenot L. Harper K.L. Mahapatra N.R.

Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the sorting and trafficking of the regulated secretory protein CgA in sympathoadrenal PC12 cells. Our results indicate that a functional H+ V-ATPase along the regulated secretory pathway is essential for the sorting of the granin to dense-core granules for exocytosis. We propose that acidification of late compartments of the secretory pathway mediates the routing of CgA by a mechanism recruiting a sorting determinant located in the amino-terminal domain of the mature protein (CgA-(1-115)) but not its carboxyl-terminal region. Moreover, our data reveal that a pH gradient over the secretory pathway is an important factor for the formation of dense-core chromaffin secretory granules in PC12 cells, perhaps by modulating the granulogenic function of CgA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transient Transfections—PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were cultured in Ham's F-12K medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum and 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) (Invitrogen). Supercoiled plasmid DNA for transfection was grown in Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) and purified on columns (Qiagen). Two days before transfection, PC12 cells were split onto either poly-l-lysine (Sigma) plus collagen (Upstate)-coated 18-mm round glass #1.5 coverslips (Fisher) in 12-well Costar plates or onto poly-l-lysine-coated 6- or 12-well Costar plates. Cells were transfected with 1.25 μg (12-well plate) or 2 μg (6-well plate) of supercoiled plasmid DNA per well using a high efficiency cationic scaffold method (GenePorter II, Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five hours after the beginning of the transfection, culture medium was replaced, and cells were further cultured for 22 or 48 h.Construction of Expression Vectors—A truncated domain of the full-length human secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP; NCBI_U89937) gene was obtained by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers incorporating an KpnI restriction site at the 5′ end and a NotI restriction endonuclease site at the 3′ end to generate EAP gene (devoid of the SEAP 17 amino acid signal peptide (MLLLLLLLGLRLQLSLG)). pSEAP2-basic plasmid was used as a template (Clontech). Full-length human CgA and two human CgA domains chimeric proteins were designed by ligating the EAP gene into the KpnI and NotI cloning sites of EGFP gene in pCMV-CgA-EGFP, pCMV-CgA481-EGFP, or pCMV-ΔNCgA-EGFP (23Taupenot L. Harper K.L. Mahapatra N.R. Parmer R.J. Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4827-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to generate pCMV-CgA-EAP, pCMV-CgA481-EAP, or pCMV-ΔNCgA-EAP. Each plasmid encodes, respectively, for the SgP-CgA-EAP, SgP-CgA-(1-115)-EAP, or SgP-CgA-(233-439)-EAP recombinant proteins (including the CgA 18 amino acid signal peptide (MRSAAVLALLLCAGQVTA), or SgP).A CgA-EAP cDNA domain incorporating a HindIII and a PmeI restriction site was obtained by PCR using pCMV-CgA-EAP as a template. The PCR product was ligated into the HindIII and PmeI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA6/myc-HisA (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA6-CgA-EAP. All the constructs were verified by restriction and nucleotide sequence analysis.Stable Expression of SgP-CgA-EAP in PC12 Cells—PC12 cells grown on collagen- and poly-l-lysine-coated 100-mm tissue culture dishes were transfected with pcDNA6-CgA-EAP, which carries the resistance gene for the eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitor blastidicin S. After 48 h of transfection, transiently transfected cells were exposed to 10 μg/ml blasticidin S (Invitrogen) for 10 days, with the antibiotic-containing medium being changed every 3 days. Blasticidin S sensitivity of the parent PC12 cells was determined in a preliminary experiment. Twenty blasticidin S-resistant PC12 cell clonal colonies were selected with cloning rings and further grown on collagen- and poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well tissue culture plates in a culture medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml blasticidin S. Blasticidin S-resistant cells were screened for regulated secretion of SgP-CgA-EAP by chemiluminescence (Phospha-Light, Applied Biosystems).Three-dimensional Imaging by Deconvolution Microscopy—Images were captured on a DeltaVision deconvolution microscopy system (Applied Precision) operated by SoftWoRx software (Applied Precision) on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station using with 60× (NA 1.4) or 100× (NA 1.4) oil immersion objectives. The system included a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ CCD camera mounted on a Nikon inverted fluorescence/differential interference contrast microscope and a mercury arc lamp light source. Pixel intensities were kept in the linear response range of the digital camera. 30-40 optical sections along the z axis were acquired with increments of 0.2 μm. The fluorescent data sets were deconvoluted and analyzed by Delta Vision SoftWoRx programs (Applied Precision) on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station to generate optical sections or three-dimensional images of the data sets. The following excitation and emission wavelengths were used for imaging: GFP, λex 490 ± 10/λem 528 ± 38 nm; cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), λex 436 ± 10/λem 465 ± 30 nm; Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate, λex 555 nm/λem 580 nm; Hoechst 33342 (nuclear DNA stain), λex 350/λem 461 nm.Chimeric Photoprotein Fluorescence and Immunocytochemistry— Transfected PC12 cells cultured on poly-l-lysine- and collagen-coated glass coverslips were fixed for 1 h at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min) and exposed to 1 μg/ml nucleic acid stain Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) for nuclei visualization. Coverslips were subsequently washed with PBS, mounted in buffered Gelvatol, and processed for three-dimensional imaging by deconvolution microscopy. For immunocytochemistry, fixed PC12 cells were incubated for 5 min in PBS, glycine (0.1 m) buffer and subsequently exposed for 30 min to PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum to reduce nonspecific antibody labeling. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a rabbit polyclonal anti-human placental alkaline phosphatase (anti-PLAP, 1:50; Biomeda) in buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were then washed and incubated for 30 min with a Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated (red) goat anti-mouse IgG, F(ab′)2 (1:250; Molecular Probes) together with 1 μg/ml nucleic acid stain Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were subsequently washed with PBS, mounted in buffered Gelvatol or Celvol, and processed for three-dimensional imaging by deconvolution microscopy.Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed in modified Karnovsky's fixative (2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °C followed by 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 and subsequently dehydrated using a graded series of ethanol solutions followed by propylene oxide and infiltration with epoxy resin. After polymerization at 65 °C overnight, thin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate (4% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol) followed by bismuth subnitrate. Sections were examined at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV using a Zeiss EM10B electron microscope.Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—Transiently transfected PC12 cells were labeled for 2 h with 1 μCi/ml l-[3H]norepinephrine (71.7 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in PC12 medium and washed with saline buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4). Cells were subsequently harvested by scraping into ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors mixture (protease inhibitor mixture set I, Calbiochem) and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were passed 16 times through a 30-gauge needle, and the lysate was centrifuged (800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was layered over a continuous sucrose density gradient (0.6-2.2 m) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. Fractions were collected and assayed for l-[3H]norepinephrine by scintillation counting, sucrose concentration by refractometry, and detection of EAP chemiluminescence (Phospha-Light, Applied Biosystems).Chemiluminescence Detection of EAP Secretion Assay—Detection of EAP activity release from CgA/EAP chimera-expressing PC12 cells was achieved using the chemiluminescent substrate 3-(4-methoxyspiro[1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.1(3,7)]decan]-4-yl) phenyl phosphate (CSPD) (Phospha-Light, Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol using a Luminometer Autolumat 953 (EG&G Berthold). Briefly, transfected cells were grown on poly-l-lysine- and collagen-coated six-well culture dishes and subsequently stimulated for 15 min with the indicated concentrations of secretagogue in secretion medium. CgA/EAP chimera activities are measured in the culture supernatant and the cell lysate. The relative secretion rate is calculated as a percentage of total enzymatic activity present in the cells before stimulation. Total enzymatic activity is the sum of the amount released plus the amount remaining in the cells.Catecholamine Secretion Assay—Catecholamine secretion from PC12 cells was performed as described previously (26Taupenot L. Mahata M. Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 1152-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine- and collagen-coated six-well culture dishes, loaded for 2 h with 1 μCi of l-[3H]norepinephrine (71.7 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and washed with secretion medium (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were subsequently stimulated for 15 min with the indicated concentrations of secretagogue in secretion medium. Relative l-[3H]norepinephrine secretion was calculated as a percentage of total radioactivity (present in the cells before stimulation), where total radioactivity is the sum of the amount released plus the amount remaining in the cells.Immunoblotting Analysis—SgP-CgA-EAP-transfected PC12 cells grown on collagen- and poly-l-lysine-coated 100-mm tissue culture dishes were extensively washed with secretion medium (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and subsequently exposed to secretion medium or to 2 mm BaCl2 in Ca2+-free secretion medium for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Extracellular milieus were collected, cleared by centrifugation (10 min, 4000 × g, 4 °C), and concentrated using reverse phase Sep-Pak C-18 silica cartridges (Waters Millipore). The solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 100% CH3CN. Eluates were lyophilized, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels (NuPage, Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked in buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h, incubated for 2 h with a polyclonal rabbit anti-placental alkaline phosphatase (1:300; Biomeda), and washed for 15 min with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Blots were subsequently incubated for 1 h with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate secondary antibody (1:3000; Bio-Rad) in blocking buffer. Immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Supersignal West Pico, Pierce).Presentation of Data—Values are given as the mean ± S.E. for at least triplicate determinations. Data are representative of a typical experiment. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test using Kaleidagraph statistical software package. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSA CgA Human EAP Chimeric Protein Can Be Transiently or Stably Expressed in Sympathoadrenal PC12 Cells Where It Is Sorted to the Catecholamine Storage Vesicle and Routed to the Regulated Pathway of Secretion—The SEAP reporter gene encodes a heat-stable, truncated form of the placental enzyme that lacks the membrane anchoring domain, thereby allowing constitutive secretion of the protein in transfected cells (6Cowley D.J.

Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). We further engineered the full-length SEAP gene by PCR to generate an EAP devoid of the SEAP 17 amino hydrophobic acid signal peptide (MLLLLLLLGLRLQLSLG). A SgP-CgA-EAP chimeric protein was designed by fusing the EAP amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus of full-length human CgA (including the CgA 18 amino acid signal peptide (MRSAAVLALLLCAGQVTA), or SgP), (Fig. 1).Three-dimensional Immunofluorescence Deconvolution Microscopy—The subcellular distribution of expressed SgP-CgA-EAP was first assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy in paraformaldehyde-fixed PC12 cells (Fig. 2A). Three-dimensional reconstruction of SgP-CgA-EAP intracellular localization revealed a non-uniform punctate distribution of the fluorescence signal throughout much of the cytoplasm but completely excluded from the nucleus. A 0.2-μm optical section acquired in the middle region of SgP-CgA-EAP-expressing PC12 cells revealed discrete peripheral/subplasmalemmal punctate fluorescence signals characteristic of the granular distribution previously reported for the photoprotein SgP-CgA-GFP (see Fig. 10 and Ref. 23Taupenot L.

These findings, therefore, suggest storage of the EAP-tagged chimera in dense-core secretory granules.Fig. 1Schematic representation of the organization of the EAP and GFP reporter proteins designed to study CgA trafficking to the dense core secretory granules of PC12 cells.

A, three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of SgP-CgA-EAP subcellular distribution. 48 h after transfection with pCMV-CgA-EAP, cells were aldehyde-fixed and processed for immunocytochemistry. Cells were incubated with an anti-human PLAP followed by an Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibody. A series of optical sections along the z axis was acquired with increments of 0.2 μm using a 100× (NA 1.4) oil immersion objective. The data set was deconvolved and analyzed to generate three-dimensional/volume or section views. Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate was imaged at λex 555 nm/λem 580 nm.

Post-nuclear supernatants prepared from l-[3H]norepinephrine-labeled PC12 cells transiently expressing SgP-CgA-EAP were centrifuged to equilibrium on sucrose density gradients.

Fractionation of these cells indicated that l-[3H]norepinephrine co-localized with SgP-CgA-EAP in the same subcellular fraction found at ∼1.4 M sucrose (Fig. 2B), consistent with the buoyant density previously reported for catecholamine storage vesicles isolated from PC12 cells (5Parmer R.J.

Here we showed that P. aeruginosa invades type I pneumocytes via a lipid raft-mediated mechanism. P. aeruginosa invasion of rat primary type I-like pneumocytes as well as a murine lung epithelial cell line 12 (MLE-12) is inhibited by drugs that remove membrane cholesterol and disrupt lipid rafts. Confocal microscopy demonstrated co-localization of intracellular P. aeruginosa with lipid raft components including caveolin-1 and -2. We generated caveolin-1 and -2 knockdowns in MLE-12 cells by using RNA interference techniques. Decreased expression of caveolin-2 significantly impaired the ability of P. aeruginosa to invade MLE-12 cells. In addition, the lipid raft-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-2 appeared to be a critical regulator of P. aeruginosa invasion.

In addition, the lipid raft-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-2 appeared to be a critical regulator of P. aeruginosa invasion. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important cause of nosocomial pneumonia, as well as a major pulmonary pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis and other immunocompromising conditions (1Chastre J.

A large number of patients develop P. aeruginosa colonization of the upper airways; however, only a small percentage of these patients develop clinically significant P. aeruginosa pneumonia. The morbidity and mortality of P. aeruginosa respiratory infections usually result from the dissemination of P. aeruginosa to the alveolar space prior to the establishment of pneumonia (2Garau J. Gomez L. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 16: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Kurahashi K. Kajikawa O. Sawa T. Ohara M. Gropper M.A. Frank D.W. Martin T.R. Wiener-Kronish J.P. J.

Physiol. 1993; 75: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa pneumonia is not completely understood.The alveolar epithelium is the largest host epithelial surface exposed to the external environment with an area roughly equal to the size of a tennis court. Approximately 95% of that surface area is lined by specialized type I pneumocytes (7Schneeberger E.E. Crystal R.G. West J.B. The Lung: Scientific Foundations. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1997: 535-542Google Scholar). Once bacteria escape the mucociliary host defenses of the upper airways and enter the alveolar space, they are likely to come in contact with type I pneumocytes. The role of type I pneumocytes in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa pneumonia is not well understood. Type I pneumocytes were initially believed to serve only simple barrier functions separating the alveolar space from the pulmonary capillaries. More recently, type I cells have been implicated in a wide range of functions including lipid metabolism, cell signaling, remodeling, and host defense (8Dahlin K. Mager E.M. Allen L. Tigue Z.

The cell membrane of type I pneumocytes has a high concentration of specialized lipid rafts and caveolae, which occupy nearly 70% of the plasma membrane (11Campbell L. Hollins A.J. Al Eid A. von Newman G.R. Ruhland C. Gumbleton M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Newman G.R. von Campbell L. Ruhland C. Jasani B. Gumbleton M. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Invasion of type 1 pneumocytes would protect P. aeruginosa from phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages and offer a protected environment for replication. P. aeruginosa invasion of type I cells may facilitate dissemination throughout the host because of the single cell thickness of the alveolar epithelium. We hypothesized that the virulence of P. aeruginosa in the development of pneumonia is at least due in part to its ability to invade type I pneumocytes.P. aeruginosa is able to invade nasal and bronchial epithelial cells via a lipid raft-dependent mechanism (13Grassme H. Jendrossek V. von Riehle A. Kurthy G. Berger J. Schwarz H. Weller M. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 14Kowalski M.P. Pier G.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are specialized areas of the plasma membrane that are detergent-insoluble, low density membrane fractions that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (15Parton R.G. Richards A.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 724-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In addition, these regions contain a number of important signaling molecules and structural proteins such as caveolins (16Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts have been implicated in a wide range of cellular functions, including lipid metabolism (17Schroeder F. Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. McIntosh A.L. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. Starodub O. Chao H. Yang H. Frolov A. Kier A.B. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 873-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), cell signaling (18Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar), and endocytosis (19Nichols B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4707-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The pathway of lipid raft-dependent endocytosis is distinguished from other clathrin-mediated endocytosis and other endocytic pathways by its sensitivity to cholesterol depletion (20Chang W.J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). An increasing number of pathogens have been recognized to co-opt the mechanism of lipid raft-mediated endocytosis in order to invade host cells (21Duncan M.J. Shin J.S. Abraham S.N. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22del Manes S. Real G. Martinez A. Nat. Rev.

Immunology. 2001; 102: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa invasion of nasal and bronchial epithelial cells induces apoptosis and shedding of the superficial layer epithelial cells (13Grassme H. Jendrossek V. von Riehle A. Kurthy G. Berger J. Schwarz H. Weller M. Kolesnick R. Gulbins E. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa may co-opt lipid raft-mediated endocytosis to invade the alveolar epithelium during the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa pneumonia. However, the single cell thickness of the alveolar epithelium may lead to markedly different consequences for the host.Caveolin proteins are key components of lipid rafts and caveolae (16Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Caveolin proteins have many important functions. In addition to serving as key structural proteins that organize caveolae platforms, caveolin proteins are important in regulating endocytosis and cell signaling (16Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 25Liu P. Rudick M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol.

The caveolin family consists of three 21–24-kDa integral membrane proteins (27Williams T.M. Lisanti M.P. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 214Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 and -2 are co-expressed on most cell types, including type I pneumocytes (26Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G. Li M. Pestell R.G. Vizio DiD. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

A majority of the research on caveolin proteins have focused on the functions of caveolin-1. We have shown previously that caveolin-1 expression is an important determinant in the uptake of Escherichia coli by bladder epithelial cells (29Duncan M.J. Li G. Shin J.S. Carson J.L. Abraham S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18944-18951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although caveolin-1 has been extensively studied, very little is known about the function of caveolin-2. Caveolin-2 interacts with caveolin-1 to form a hetero-oligomeric complex within lipid rafts (30Das K. Lewis R.Y. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18721-18728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 31Sowa G. Pypaert M. Fulton D. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6511-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Unlike caveolin-1, caveolin-2 is not required for the formation of caveolae and has not been implicated previously in cell signaling (32Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is required as a chaperone to transport caveolin-2 to the cell surface (33Mora R. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A. Scherer P.E. Brown D. Lisanti M.P. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25708-25717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the absence of caveolin-1, caveolin-2 is degraded, and its expression is markedly decreased (34Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Galbiati F. Rizzo G. Grignani F. Engelman J.A. Okamoto T. Ikezu T.

Thus, it is possible that many of the functions previously attributed to caveolin-1 may be due to caveolin-2.In this paper we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa invades type I pneumocytes via a lipid raft-dependent mechanism. In addition, P. aeruginosa invasion of alveolar epithelial cells is dependent on expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-2.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150–200 g were obtained from Taconic Laboratories.Type II Cell Isolation—Isolation of primary rat type II cells was accomplished by using methods published previously (35Dobbs L.G. Williams M.C. Brandt A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 846: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Approximately 20–30 million type II cells were isolated per rat with >90% viability as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Purity was greater than 85% type II cells as confirmed by Papanicolaou staining. Cells were seeded on tissue culture plastic plates at a density of 6 × 105 cells/cm2 and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with dexamethasone and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). At 36 h cell cultures were washed three times to remove nonadherent cells and to enrich the percentage of type II cells. All experiments were performed on days 6–7 to allow differentiation into the type I-like phenotype (35Dobbs L.G. Williams M.C. Brandt A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 846: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Bacterial Strains and Cell Lines—P. aeruginosa strain 27853 and strain PAO-1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). P. aeruginosa strains were grown in 5 ml of static LB broth for 18 h. Listeria monocytogenes was grown for 18 h in 5 ml of brain heart infusion broth (BD Biosciences). After static incubation for 18 h, bacterial cultures were diluted 1:50 and placed on shaker at 37 °C for 2–3 h until they reached mid-log growth phase with an A600 0.4–0.8.MLE-12 1The abbreviations used are: MLE-12, murine lung epithelial cell line 12; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; MCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; OA, okadaic acid; MTT, thiazolyl blue tetrazolium; cav-1, caveolin-1; cav-2, caveolin-2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. cells were graciously provided by Landon King (The Johns Hopkins University) and were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2.0 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.3 g/liter l-glutamine, 2.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Creation of Caveolin Knockdowns Using RNA Interference—RNA interference vectors were generated using pQCXIN retroviral vector (BD Biosciences). Briefly, pQCXIN was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and then was religated to generate pQCXIN1. Human U6 small nuclear RNA promoter was PCR-amplified from pTZ U6 + 1 (gift from John Rossi, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA) with added BglII site (5′ ends), BamHI, and XbaI sites (3′ ends). The PCR product was cloned to the BglII and XbaI sites of pQCXIN1 to generate pOCXIN-U6. The following oligonucleotides were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Coralville, IA: C1a, 5′-GATCCGGAGATTGACCTGGTCAACTTCAAGAGAGTTGACCAGGTCAATCTCCTTTTTT-3′, and C1b, 5′-CTAGAAAAAAGGAGATTGACCTGGTCAACTCTCTTGAAGTTGACCAGGTCAATCTCCG-3′; C2a, 5′-GATCCGGCCGATGTGCAGCTCTTCTTCAAGAGAGAAGAGCTGCACATCGGCCTTTTTT-3′, and C2b, 5′-CTAGAAAAAAGGCCGATGTGCAGCTCTTCTCTCTTGAAGAAGAGCTGCACATCGGCCG-3′. The boldface and underlined sequences are forward and reverse sequences, respectively, which correspond to nucleotides 221–239 of the mouse caveolin-1 gene (C1a and C1b, GenBank™ accession number NM_007616) and nucleotides 41–59 of the mouse caveolin-2 gene (C2a and C2b, GenBank™ accession number NM_016900). C1a and C1b and C2a and C2b were annealed to form double-stranded DNA and cloned into BamHI and XbaI sites of pQCXIN-U6 to generate pSi-Cav1and pSi-Cav2. Amphopack-293 Cell Line (BD Biosciences) was used to produce the viral particles. Production of viral particles, infection of target cell line (MLE-12), and selection of viral infected cells were performed as recommended by the vendor of the pQCXIN vector (BD Biosciences). The neomycin-resistant stable-transfected cell lines were named pQC-cav-1 and pQC-cav-2. In the same way, oligonucleotides Lu1 5′-GATCCGTACGCGGAATACTTCGAATTCAAGAGATTCGAAGTATTCCGCGTACTTTTTT-3′ and Lu1a 5′-CTAGAAAAAAGTACGCGGAATACTTCGAATCTCTTGAATTCGAAGTATTCCGCGTACG-3′ (the forward and reverse sequences) correspond to nucleotides 423–441 of the firefly luciferase in the pGL2-control vector. GenBank™ accession number X65324 was used to generate the control cell line pQC-LUC.Rat Model of P. aeruginosa Pneumonia—150-g Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with halothane and then orotracheally intubated. ATCC 27853 bacteria were grown to mid-log phase and labeled with PKH2 dye (Sigma) per the manufacturer's protocol. P10 tubing was inserted into the left lower lobe, and 350 μl of bacteria in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin was instilled. Animals were sacrificed after 90 min. The lungs were lavaged 10 times with PBS/EDTA to remove any nonadherent bacteria. The lungs were inflated to total lung capacity with optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium (Miles Scientific) and frozen at -80 °C. Ten-micron frozen sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica). Sections were fixed in 100% acetone at -20 °C for 5 min prior to labeling for confocal microscopy. They were then washed with PBS prior to blocking with 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 h. The following primary antibodies were diluted 1:100 in 10% goat serum and added to the sections for 1 h; rabbit polyclonal caveolin-1 (BD Biosciences), rabbit polyclonal caveolin-2 (Abcam), and RT140 (courtesy of Leland Dobbs, University of California, San Francisco). Cells were then washed three times with 10% goat serum. Goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 660 (Molecular Probes) were diluted 1:250 and added to cells for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with 10% goat serum and mounted using Prolong Gold Anti-fade (Molecular Probes) for examination by confocal microscopy.Confocal Microscopy—Primary rat type II cells were grown on Permanox© plastic chamber slides for 6 days. MLE-12 cells were seeded onto collagen coated 12-mm diameter glass coverslips placed into the wells of a 24-well plate and grown for 36 h. The cells were infected with ATCC 27853 strain of P. aeruginosa conjugated to the amine reactive Alexa Fluor 660 (Molecular Probes). The infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, washed four times with PBS (Invitrogen) to remove unbound bacteria, and fixed overnight in 2.0% paraformaldehyde in PBS. To examine caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 labeling, cells were grown and infected as above. After removing the fixative, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Caveolin-1 was then labeled using polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (BD Biosciences); caveolin-2 was labeled with mouse polyclonal caveolin-2 antibody (Abcam), and GM1 was labeled using a biotinylated cholera toxin. Type I cells labeled with RT140 antibody (1:500). Alexa 488 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used for each experiment. Coverslips were examined using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope. Confocal microscopy was also used to quantify the percentage of intracellular bacteria that co-localize with caveolin proteins. Co-localization was determined by identifying bacteria within the center of cells that co-localize with intracellular vesicle staining for caveolin-1 or -2. Twenty five intracellular bacteria per slide were counted for analysis.Electron Microscopy—Rat type II cells were isolated as described above and cultured on Thermanox© plastic coverslips for 6 days. Cells were infected with P. aeruginosa for 45 min. Cells were then washed four times with PBS and fixed with glutaraldehyde, dehydrated with cold acetone, and processed using standard methods. The cells were examined by transmission electron microscopy.Bacterial Invasion and Adherence Assays—Type I-like pneumocytes or MLE-12 cells were seeded into 96-well plates. Type I-like cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 105 cells/cm2. MLE-12 cells were grown to ∼80% confluency for all experiments. For infections with strains of P. aeruginosa, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 300–600 bacteria per host cell by the addition of 100 μl of bacteria diluted in serum-free cell culture medium containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), A600 1.0. Due to the increased cytotoxicity associated with L. monocytogenes, cells were infected at a m.o.i. 50–100, A600 0.1. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing 50 μg/ml of the membrane-impermeable antibiotic gentamicin (Invitrogen) to kill extracellular bacteria and incubated for 45 min. Each well was washed three times with PBS. In order to remove and lyse the cells, 30 μl of 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) was added to each well for 5 min, and 70 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS was then added. Cells were scraped and transferred to 0.65-ml tubes, and each well was washed with an additional 100 μl of Triton that was also transferred to the tubes. The cell lysates were diluted and plated onto LB agar plates for Pseudomonas strains or brain heart infusion agar plates for L. monocytogenes. In order to quantify the number of adherent bacteria, the cells were exposed to P. aeruginosa for 45 min at 4 °C, which inhibits endocytosis. They were then washed five times with PBS to remove nonadherent bacteria, serially diluted, and plated on LB agar, and the number of colony-forming units were counted to quantify adherent bacteria.To test the effect of pretreatment by specific lipid rafts disrupters/usurpers on bacterial invasion, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD, 3 mm, Sigma), nystatin (20 μg/ml, Sigma), or filipin (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma) in serum-free medium was added to the cells for 30 min and then washed off prior to infection. To reinsert cholesterol back into the plasma membrane after MCD treatment, cells were incubated for 1 h with a cholesterol-cyclodextrin complex (0.2 mm) (36Sharma D.K. Brown J.C. Choudhury A. Peterson T.E. Holicky E. Marks D.L. Simari R. Parton R.G. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3114-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To test the effect of altering tyrosine phosphorylation on bacterial invasion, the cells were pretreated with genistein (100 μg/ml, Sigma) for 30 min prior to infection and throughout the period of infection. The effects of okadaic acid (OA, 10 nm, Sigma) were examined by having OA present throughout the infection without any pretreatment. After the preincubation step, the cells were washed, and the medium was replaced with bacteria in serum-free medium with or without the agent being tested as required. A gentamicin protection assay was performed as detailed above to quantify intracellular bacteria. The viability of the cells was not affected by any of the treatments used as determined by trypan blue exclusion.An MTT adherence assay was performed as follows. Cells were plated 96-well plates and then incubated with drugs for 30 min as stated above and then fixed overnight with 2.0% paraformaldehyde. The monolayers were washed three times with sterile PBS and pretreated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS). 100 μl of P. aeruginosa, ATCC 27853 (A600 1.0) in PBS, was incubated with cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Nonadherent bacteria were removed by washing the cell monolayers three times with PBS. Fifty microliters of LB was applied to each monolayer and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Fifty microliters of 2 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) was added, and the plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow reduction of MTT to formazan by live bacteria. Next, 150 μl of isopropyl alcohol and hydrochloric acid (24:1) was added to solubilize the formazan, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Tecan Sunrise remote microplate reader.Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown in a 6-well plate to greater than 90% confluency. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1:10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and protease inhibitor mixture (1:100, Sigma). Total protein was quantified using Bradford dye (Bio-Rad) and measured at A595. Cell lysates were normalized for protein and volume. Samples were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was then performed using antibodies against tubulin (1:2000, Sigma), caveolin-1 (1:500, BD Biosciences), or caveolin-2 (1:500, BD Biosciences), and the proteins were detected using Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent kit (Pierce).Caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates of MLE-12 cells as follows. MLE-12 cells were grown to 90% confluency in 6-well plates. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS. The cells were then lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 1:10), n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (60 mm, Sigma), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), protease inhibitor, phosphatase mixture (Sigma, 1:100)). The sample was precleared with 30 μlofa50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of a 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose in PBS plus 8 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 (BD Biosciences) or 6 μg of rabbit polyclonal caveolin-2 (Abcam) was added. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS and resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were assayed with antibodies for caveolin-1 (BD Biosciences), caveolin-2 (BD Biosciences and Abcam), or phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. 4G10) by Western blotting as described above. In addition, Image J software (National Institutes of Health) was used for densitometry to quantify protein expression for statistical analysis.Statistics—Data were compiled and analyzed using Microsoft Excel©. Data for gentamicin protection assays are reported as a mean of at least three experiments with error bars set as S.E. Significance was calculated using a two-tailed t test with significance defined and a p value of less than 0.05. Graphs were created using Graph Pad© Prism 3.0.RESULTSP. aeruginosa Invades Type I Pneumocytes during the Pathogenesis of Pneumonia—Although P. aeruginosa frequently colonizes the upper airways of susceptible hosts, the development of P. aeruginosa pneumonia requires dissemination to the alveolar space prior to the development of epithelial cell damage and alveolar filling. We sought to determine whether P. aeruginosa invades type I pneumocytes during the pathogenesis of pneumonia by using a rat model of P. aeruginosa pneumonia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were intubated, and fluorescently labeled P. aeruginosa was instilled directly into the left lower lobe. Animals were sacrificed 90 min after instillation to examine the early stages of pneumonia prior to the development of severe lung injury. We examined frozen thin sections of rat lung to examine the location of P. aeruginosa within alveolar spaces. In Fig. 1A, the type I pneumocytes are labeled red with the type I cell-specific antibody, RT140. The yellow staining demonstrates areas of co-localization where P. aeruginosa is directly adherent to and possibly within type I pneumocytes. Thus, type I pneumocytes appear to be a main site of P. aeruginosa infection in a rat model of P. aeruginosa pneumonia.P. aeruginosa Invades Type I-like Pneumocytes in an in Vitro Model of the Alveolar Epithelium—We used a common in vitro model of primary type I-like pneumocytes (35Dobbs L.G. Williams M.C. Brandt A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 846: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to determine whether P. aeruginosa is able to invade type I cells. Type II cells are easily isolated and known to be the progenitor cells of the alveolar epithelium. When cultured on plastic tissue culture surface for 5–7 days, the type II cells differentiate into type I-like cells with features typical of primary type I cells. Type I-like cells have a similar membrane lipid content to primary type I pneumocytes (35Dobbs L.G. Williams M.C. Brandt A.E. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2031891276,"The N-terminal regions, which are highly variable in small heat-shock proteins, were found to be structurally disordered in all the 24 subunits of Methanococcus jannaschii Hsp16.5 oligomer and half of the 12 subunits of wheat Hsp16.9 oligomer. The structural and functional roles of the corresponding region (potentially disordered) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Hsp16.3, existing as nonamers, were investigated in this work. The data demonstrate that the mutant Hsp16.3 protein with 35 N-terminal residues removed (ΔN35) existed as trimers/dimers rather than as nonamers, failing to bind the hydrophobic probe (1,1′-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid) and exhibiting no chaperone-like activity. Nevertheless, another mutant protein with the C-terminal extension (of nine residues) removed, although existing predominantly as dimers, exhibited efficient chaperone-like activity even at room temperatures, indicating that pre-existence as nonamers is not a prerequisite for its chaperone-like activity. Meanwhile, the mutant protein with both the N- and C-terminal ends removed fully exists as a dimer lacking any chaperone-like activity. Furthermore, the N-terminal region alone, either as a synthesized peptide or in fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, was capable of interacting with denaturing proteins. These observations strongly suggest that the N-terminal region of Hsp16.3 is not only involved in self-oligomerization but also contains the critical site for substrate binding. Such a dual role for the N-terminal region would provide an effective mechanism for the small heat-shock protein to modulate its chaperone-like activity through oligomeric dissociation/reassociation. In addition, this study demonstrated that the wild-type protein was able to form heterononamers with ΔN35 via subunit exchange at a subunit ratio of 2:1. This implies that the 35 N-terminal residues in three of the nine subunits in the wild-type nonamer are not needed for the assembly of nonamers from trimers and are thus probably structurally disordered.

Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock ProteinsMolecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that sHSPs exhibit chaperone-like activities and are able to prevent the aggregation of denaturing substrate proteins via the formation of tightly bound complexes with them (4Horwitz J.

Such complexes are believed to act as a reservoir of the unfolded substrate proteins, which might refold into their native structures with the aid of other types of molecular chaperones (6Lee G.J.

Small heat-shock proteins usually exist as oligomers (with 9–40 subunits) that undergo dynamic dissociation/reassociation, a structural feature that is apparently required for their chaperone-like activities (9Ehrnsperger M.

In the primary structure, they are characterized by the presence of a conserved α-crystallin domain (80–100 residues) that is preceded by an N-terminal region of variable sequence and length and followed by a short C-terminal extension (1Kappe G. Leunissen J.A. de Jong W.W. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2000; 28: 1-17Google Scholar, 16Plesofsky-Vig N. Vig J. Brambl R. J. Mol.

A plethora of studies have demonstrated that the α-crystallin domain is responsible for the formation of dimers that in turn act as building blocks for larger oligomers (12van Montfort R.L.M.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas the variation in the N-terminal region of sHSPs is believed to be responsible for their differences in oligomeric size and symmetry (22Haley D.A.

Truncation of the N-terminal regions of sHSPs from vertebrate (αA-crystallin), Caenorhabditis elegans (Hsp16–2), and Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hsp26) have been reported to lead to the generation of smaller oligomers that failed to exhibit chaperone-like activities (20Leroux M.R.

One interesting observation is that the N-terminal region was found to be structurally disordered in half of the subunits of the 12-mer of Hsp16.9 (from wheat) and all of the subunits of the 24-mer of Hsp16.5 (from Methanococcus jannaschii) as revealed by the determined crystal structures (12van Montfort R.L.M.

Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Therefore, two questions were posed with regard to Hsp16.3, a nonameric small heat-shock protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (27Chang Z. Primm T.P. Jakana J. Lee I.H. Serysheva I. Chiu W. Gilbert H.F. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7218-7224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the three-dimensional structure of which has yet to be determined (28Chen Y. An J. Ding Y. Dai H. Mao Q. Feng L. Liu B. Chang Y. Chen F. He H. Tang H. Chang Z. Rao Z. Protein Pept. Lett. 2001; 8: 499-502Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). First, does the N-terminal region in Hsp16.3 help the protein to form its nonameric structure or/and to exhibit chaperone-like activity? Second, does Hsp16.3 share any features with Hsp16.9 or Hsp16.5 in containing disordered N-terminal regions for part or all of the subunits? Hsp16.3 was originally identified as an immunodominant antigen and later found to be a major membrane protein (29Coates A.R.M. Hewitt J. Allen B.W. Ivanyi J. Mitchison D.A. Lancet. 1981; 2: 167-169Abstract PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Lee B.Y. Hefta S.A. Brennan P.J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that Hsp16.3: 1) exists as nonamers, which are assembled by using trimers and hexamers as intermediates (27Chang Z. Primm T.P. Jakana J. Lee I.H. Serysheva I.

Commun. 2003; 310: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); and 3) exhibit chaperone-like activities that are modulated by adjusting the equilibrium and/or rate of the oligomeric dissociation process (13Gu L. Abulimiti A. Li W. Chang Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Fu X. Liu C. Liu Y. Feng X. Gu L. Chen X. Chang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The data presented here conclusively demonstrate that the N-terminal region of Hsp16.3 is not only involved in the formation of nonamers from trimers but also contains the critical site for binding denaturing substrate proteins. The results also suggest that the nonameric structure per se is not a prerequisite for Hsp16.3 to exhibit chaperone-like activities and that the dimeric form is active. In addition, the N-terminal regions in three of the nine subunits of the Hsp16.3 nonamer seem to be structurally disordered. The physiological implications of such a dual role for the N-terminal region in both oligomerization and substrate binding, as well as the existence of disordered N-terminal regions in part of the subunits, is discussed. The Hsp16.3 trimers were suggested to be asymmetric and to be formed by the interactions between a dimer and a third subunit. Materials—Dithiothreitol (DTT), 1,1′-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS), and insulin were all obtained from Sigma. MutantBest Kit was purchased from TaKaRa Biotechnology (Dalian, China). DEAE-Sepharose FastFlow and Source Q for chromatography were all obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The N-terminal region peptide of Hsp16.3 (because the first amino acid, Met, is removed in the recombinant Hsp16.3 protein, the peptide of amino acids from 2–35 (i.e. ATTLPVQRHPRSLFPEFSELFAAFPSFAGLRPTF) is synthesized) was prepared by GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd. The peptide was synthesized by using the Peptide Synthesizer CS536 (CS Bio Co.), purified by LC-10Avp (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and identified by the mass spectrometry of Agilent LC-MSD SL. All other chemical reagents were of analytical purity. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—The gene for Hsp16.3 was subcloned into the pET-9d expression vector as described previously (27Chang Z. Primm T.P. Jakana J. Lee I.H. Serysheva I. Chiu W. Gilbert H.F. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7218-7224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The Hsp16.3 mutants ΔN35, ΔC9, and ΔN35ΔC9 were constructed using MutantBest Kit, according to the method described previously (32Fu X. Li W. Mao Q. Chang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant Hsp16.3 wild-type and truncated proteins were over-expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) host cells transformed with the corresponding plasmid. The wild-type protein was purified as described previously (13Gu L. Abulimiti A. Li W. Chang Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To purify the ΔN35 mutant protein, the supernatant of cell lysates was loaded onto DEAE-Sepharose FastFlow columns pre-equilibrated with 30 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.5, and then eluted with a salt gradient made of 0.1–0.4 m NaCl. The fractions containing ΔN35 were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, loaded onto a Source Q column, and eluted with a salt gradient made of 0.2–0.5 m NaCl. The ΔC9 protein was purified similarly with the following modifications: 20 mm piperazine-HCL (pH 5.5; elution, 0.1–0.3 m NaCl) and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5; elution, 0.1–0.4 m NaCl) were used for the first and the second chromatography operations, respectively. The ΔN35ΔC9 mutant protein was purified similarly with the following modifications: 20 mm piperazine-HCl (pH 6.0; elution, 0.1–0.3 m NaCl) and 20 mm piperazine-HCl (pH 6.0; elution, 0.1–0.3 m NaCl) were used for the first and second chromatography operations, respectively, and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography by Superdex 200 10/30 column. The gene for the fusion protein of the N-terminal region peptide of Hsp16.3 with glutathione S-transferase (GST) was constructed by using the expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein of GST-peptide was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) at midlog phase of bacterial growth (A600 of 0.6–0.8) by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. To purify the fusion protein, the supernatant of cell lysates, suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), was loaded to a glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity matrix. The contaminant proteins were removed by 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 500 mm sodium chloride, and the fusion protein was eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. The GST protein was also purified with similar procedures. All of the purified proteins were dialyzed in deionized water, lyophilized, and stored at –20 °C before further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay. CD Spectroscopy and Secondary Structure Prediction—CD spectra were recorded on a J-715-150L spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a temperature-controlling water-bath. A protein sample of 300 μl (0.2 mg/ml) was added in a 2-mm quartz cuvette and scanned after being equilibrated at 25 °C for 10 min. The spectra were recorded with a 1-nm bandwidth and a 0.5-nm step size at a rate of 1 nm/s. Each spectrum represents an average of four such runs. Sequence-based prediction of the secondary structural propensity of the N-terminal 35 residues was performed by various programs using different algorithms: 1) PROF, 2) SCRATCH, 3) PHD secondary structure and solvent accessibility prediction, 4) nnpredict, 5) HMM-based Protein Sequence Analysis SAM-T99, 6) SOPM, 7) Hierarchical Neural Network, 8) GOR4, and 9) PSIPRED. All of the predictions were performed via the links on the web site cn.expasy.org/tools/#secondary. Primary Structure Analysis—The hydropathy indexes for Hsp16.3 and other sHSPs were calculated on the web site cn.expasy.org/tools/protscale.html by using the method of Kyte and Doolittle (33Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar). The window size was set to 11 residues. Chemical Cross-linking by Glutaraldehyde—Glutaraldehyde (0.5%) and Hsp16.3 proteins reacted at 25 °C in 50 mm phosphate sodium buffer, pH 7.0, for 1, 5, or 10 min, as described previously (15Fu X. Chang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by quenching with 1 m Tris-HCl for 10 min. The cross-linked samples were then analyzed through SDS-PAGE (12%) and visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue staining. Non-denaturing Pore-gradient PAGE—The pore-gradient polyacrylamide gel having a 4–20% linear gradient concentration of acrylamide was prepared in a 125 × 100 × 1-mm mold as described previously (34Yamaoka T. Analyt. Chim. Acta. 1998; 372: 91-98Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The electrophoresis was performed at a constant electric current of 2 mA at room temperature for 18 h and then visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue staining. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a ΔKTA fast performance liquid chromatography system using pre-packed Superdex 200 10/30 column (all from Amersham Biosciences). For each analysis, a 100-μl protein sample was loaded (centrifuged before loading) and eluted with 50 mm phosphate sodium buffer (containing 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.0) at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. The column was calibrated with the following high molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad): thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; bovine gamma globulin, 158 kDa; chicken ovalbumin, 44 kDa; equine myoglobin, 17 kDa; and vitamin B-12, 1.35 kDa. Chaperone-like Activity Assay—Chaperone-like activities of Hsp16.3 were assayed by measuring their capacity to suppress the thermal DTT-induced (10 or 20 mm) aggregation of insulin (0.3 or 0.4 mg/ml), at 25 °C, 35 °C, or 45 °C as described previously (13Gu L. Abulimiti A. Li W. Chang Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The aggregation was recorded by light scattering at 360 nm on a UV-8500 spectrophotometer (Shanghai Techcomp, China) that was connected to a water-bath (Multitemp III; Amersham Biosciences). The capacity of the synthesized peptide of Hsp16.3 N-terminal region to suppress the DTT-induced (20 mm) aggregation of lysozyme (1 mg/ml) at 35 °C was also measured. The chaperone-like activity is also assayed by measuring the capacity of Hsp16.3 proteins (all at 0.4 mg/ml) to suppress the thermal aggregation of E. coli BL21 (DE3) whole-cell extract (at 65 °C for 25 min). After being cooled to room temperature, supernatants (centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min), and precipitates (washed twice) of mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To examine the influence of the pre-binding of bis-ANS on the chaperone-like activities of Hsp16.3, the wild-type protein photoincorporated with bis-ANS (photoincorporated at 35 °C for 20 min using the method described below, with the residual bis-ANS removed by dialysis) were assayed with higher concentrations of DTT (20 mm) and insulin (0.4 mg/ml) and monitored at 35 °C. Analysis of Hsp16.3-Substrate Complexes—The formation of complexes between the wild-type or mutant Hsp16.3 proteins and denaturing substrate proteins was examined by size-exclusion chromatography. The reaction mixtures having Hsp16.3 protein (0.3 mg/ml), insulin (0.3 mg/ml), and DTT (10 mm) were incubated at 45 °C for 30 min, and then supernatants (centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min) were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography. Photoincorporation of bis-ANS into Hsp16.3 Proteins—Photoincorporating bis-ANS into Hsp16.3 proteins was carried out according to methods described previously (6Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 35Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In brief, the Hsp16.3 protein (0.4 mg/ml) was incubated with bis-ANS (100 μm) at 35 °C or 65 °C for 10 min, and the mixture was then irradiated in a UVC 500 cross-linker (Amersham Biosciences) at the power of 120,000 μJ/cm2 for 20 min at 35 °C or 65 °C. To detect the influence of the pre-binding of denaturing substrate proteins on the ability of Hsp16.3 to bind bis-ANS, the wild-type protein (0.2 mg/ml) was pre-incubated with insulin (0.2 or 0.4 mg/ml) and DTT (20 mm) at 65 °C for 5 min before the addition of bis-ANS (final concentration, 100 μm) and UV cross-linking at 65 °C for 20 min. The non-aggregating protein IgG (0.4 mg/ml) was used in place of insulin as a control. Fluorescence Assay for the bis-ANS Bound to Hsp16.3 Protein—The fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS bound to Hsp16.3 proteins (wild-type and mutant) was measured by scanning between 450 and 560 nm with excitation wavelength at 390 nm on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The Hsp16.3 proteins (0.036 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were incubated with 15 μm bis-ANS at 25 °C for 10 min before scanning. The bis-ANS photoincorporated into Hsp16.3 proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was first visualized on a UV transilluminator (BioImaging System; UVP, Upland, CA) and later stained by Coomassie brilliant blue. Subunit Exchange between Wild-type and ΔN35 Mutant Hsp16.3 Proteins—The subunit exchange between these two proteins was examined by size-exclusion chromatography. In brief, the purified wild-type and ΔN35 proteins were mixed at different mass ratios (0.5:0, 0:1, 0.5:1, 2:1, or 2.1:0.8, where 1 represents 2.4 mg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for different lengths of time (2 h or 6 h); the reaction mixture then underwent size-exclusion chromatography analysis. The protein samples pooled at each elution peak were concentrated with a MicroconYM-3 tube (Millipore) before being examined by SDS-PAGE (visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue staining). The protein bands on the gel were quantitated by densitometric analysis, using the Imagemaster totallab software (version 1.0; Amersham Biosciences). Blue Native PAGE—The blue native PAGE having a 4–30% linear gradient concentration of acrylamide was prepared as described previously (36Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The electrophoresis was performed at a constant electric current of 6 mA at 4 °C. The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The Removal of the Potentially Disordered N-terminal 35 Residues of Hsp16.3 Had Little Effect on the Protein Secondary Structure—Sequence alignment of the whole sequences of Hsp16.3, Hsp16.5, and Hsp16.9 (Fig. 1A) revealed that the 35 N-terminal residues of Hsp16.3 corresponded to the N-terminal regions of Hsp16.9 and Hsp16.5, which are structurally disordered in half of the 12 subunits of the former and all 24 subunits of the latter (12van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Fieldrich K.L. Viering E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 18Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). To probe the structural and functional roles of the corresponding region in Hsp16.3, a mutant protein (ΔN35) with this region removed was generated. Far-UV CD spectroscopy was first applied to examine whether the secondary structure of the protein is affected by such truncation. The result shown in Fig. 1C indicates that the second-ary structure of Hsp16.3 was almost unaffected by the removal of this N-terminal region, and β-sheets were dominant in both the wild-type and mutant Hsp16.3 proteins, as indicated by the peak at around 215 nm. This result indicates that the remaining amino acids retained the primarily β-sheet structure of the whole protein. Supporting this hypothesis is the secondary structure prediction result, which suggests that the N-terminal 35 residues of Hsp16.3 most likely exist as random coils (data not shown). The ΔN35 Mutant Hsp16.3 Protein Exists As Trimers/Dimers Rather Than Nonamers—How does the removal of the N-terminal 35 residues affect the oligomeric size of the Hsp16.3 protein? Analysis results using three various methods (all presented in Fig. 2) unequivocally demonstrate that the ΔN35 mutant protein exists as trimers/dimers rather than nonamers. In the first place, only covalently linked trimers and dimers were detected when the mutant protein was cross-linked by glutaraldehyde (lane 9 in Fig. 2A). In the second place, only bands corresponding to trimers and dimers were observed when the mutant protein was analyzed by using non-denaturing pore-gradient PAGE (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Finally, the ΔN35 protein was eluted in size-exclusion chromatography analysis as two overlapping peaks corresponding to its trimer and dimer forms when loaded at high protein concentrations (Fig. 2C, curve 4), as one peak of its dimer form when loaded at low protein concentrations (curve 7), and again as trimer and dimer when the diluted protein was reconcentrated before chromatography (curve 8). This result indicated that the trimeric form of the ΔN35 mutant protein is in a concentration-dependent equilibrium with the dimeric form. The presence of a high level of monomers in the mutant protein samples subject to chemical cross-linking (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 8 and 9 with lanes 4 and 5) may indicate a weaker interaction between the subunits in the trimers/dimers, allowing modification by glutaraldehyde but also allowing the subunits not cross-linked to dissociate and exist as monomers. The ΔN35 Mutant Hsp16.3 Protein Fails to Exhibit Chaperone-like Activities—We then examined whether the removal of the 35 N-terminal residues would affect the chaperone-like activity of Hsp16.3. A complete lack of such chaperone-like activity for the ΔN35 mutant protein, as indicated by its failure to suppress DTT-induced aggregation of insulin proteins at 45 °C, is unambiguously shown by the results presented in Fig. 3. A similar result was also obtained when the whole-cell extracts of E. coli were used as the substrate, whereas the wild-type Hsp16.3 effectively suppressed the thermal aggregation of such whole-cell extracts (data not shown). Consistent with these observations, no complexes between the ΔN35 mutant protein and denaturing insulin molecules were detected by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4The dimeric ΔC9 mutant Hsp16.3 protein exhibits efficient chaperone-like activity at room tempe"

The most conserved glycans were less flexible in the structures, interacting with protein residues and contributing to receptor folding and expression. The first N-linked glycan in ICAM-2 contacts an exposed tryptophan residue, defining a conserved glycan-W motif critical for the conformation of the integrin binding domain. The absence of this motif in human ICAM-1 exposes regions used in receptor dimerization and rhinovirus recognition. Experiments with soluble molecules having the N-terminal two domains of human ICAMs identified glycans of the high mannose type N-linked to the second domain of the dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin lectin-ligands ICAM-2 and ICAM-3. About 40% of those receptor molecules bear endoglycosidase H sensitive glycans responsible of the lectin binding activity. High mannose glycans were absent in ICAM-1, which did not bind to the lectin, but they appeared in ICAM-1 mutants with additional N-linked glycosylation and lectin binding activity. N-Linked glycosylation regulate both conformation and immune related functions of ICAM receptors.

N-Linked glycosylation regulate both conformation and immune related functions of ICAM receptors. Most of the cellular receptors that populate the cell surface are glycosylated so that heterogeneous glycan moieties decorate the extracellular regions of the membrane bound proteins, building the so-called glycocalyx. The glycoproteins can contain both N-linked (Asn-linked) and O-linked (Ser/Thr-linked) glycans of variable length and composition. Complex, hybrid, and high mannose glycans are usually present in glycoproteins. The glycosylation pattern appears protein, N-linked site, and cell specific so that a diverse glycosylation repertoire is present on cell and viral surfaces (1Ashford D.A. Alafi C.D. Gamble V.M.

The local conformation of the proteins and the overall multidomain arrangement can influence the processing of a glycan at an individual N-linked site (1Ashford D.A. Alafi C.D. Gamble V.M. Mackay D.J.G. Rademacher T.W. Williams P.J. Dwek R.A. Barclay A.N. Davis S.J. Somoza C. Ward H.A. Williams A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3260-3267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variations in the carbohydrate structure linked to individual sites lead to heterogeneity in glycoprotein samples. It is generally accepted that glycans shield protein surfaces and prevent nonspecific protein-protein interactions, providing protease protection and increasing glycoprotein stability (3Rudd P.M. Ellison M.J. Cresswell P. Wilson I.A. Dwek R.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus exploit glycosylation by using it to mask protein epitopes from antibody recognition (4Kwong P.D. Doyle M.L. Casper D.J. Cicala C. Leavitt S.A. Majeed S. Steenbeke T.D. Venturi M. Chaiken I. Fung M. Katinger H. Parren P.W. Robinson J. Van Ryk D. Wang L. Burton D.R. Freire E. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Arthos J. Nature. 2002; 420: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Some glycans have a great influence on the conformation of the receptor proteins to which they are linked, modulating their ligand binding activity (5Wyss D.F. Choi J.S. Li J. Knoppers M.H.

Those glycans have a particular relation with protein residues such as that described for the inmunoadhesin CD2, where a glycan located on the opposite side of the ligand binding surface counterbalances a cluster of positive-charged residues and stabilizes the immunoglobulin domain for cell adhesive interactions (5Wyss D.F. Choi J.S. Li J. Knoppers M.H. Willis K.J. Arulanandam A.R.N. Smoylar A. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. Science. 1995; 269: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Glycans in some viral receptors are known to stabilize the virus binding surface (7Maisner A. Alvarez J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson D.J. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J.

The members of the ICAM 1The abbreviations used are: ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; IgSF, immunoglobulin superfamily; DC-SIGN, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin; HRV, human rhinovirus; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; endo-H, endoglycosidase H. subfamily are heavily glycosylated cell surface receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). They share functional and structural homologies and mediate cell-cell adhesion interactions relevant for the function of the immune system (9Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). Adhesive interactions between members of the ICAM subfamily and leukocyte integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1 mediate leukocyte trafficking through inflamed and uninflamed tissues and contribute to antigen-specific T-cell responses. The recently reported binding of ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 to the C-type lectin dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is relevant for the function of dendritic cells (10Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Adema G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Binding of DC-SIGN to ICAM-2 regulates emigration of dendritic cells, rolling in shear flow, and transmigration through endothelium (11Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Krooshoop D.J.E.B. Bleijs D.A. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. Grabovsky V. Alon R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the interaction of DC-SIGN with ICAM-3 establishes initial contact between dendritic cells and resting T-cells during antigen presentation (11Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Krooshoop D.J.E.B. Bleijs D.A. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. Grabovsky V. Alon R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Whereas the integrin binding surface in ICAMs is glycan-free (12Casasnovas J.M. Pieroni C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3017-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yan Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.-H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), the recognition of DC-SIGN is dependent on carbohydrates (10Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Adema G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The lectin binds with high affinity to high mannose and fucose-containing carbohydrates (14Guo Y. Feinberg H. Conroy E. Mitchell D.A. Alvarez R. Blixt O. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2004; 11: 591-598Crossref Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Six members of the ICAM subfamily have been described so far, all binding to the integrin LFA-1 (αLβ2) but showing large variation in tissue distribution (15Gahmberg C.G. Tolvanen M. Kotovuori P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 215-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The ICAMs are type I membrane proteins with a single transmembrane segment and concatenated IgSF domains in the extracellular region. The LFA-1 integrin binds to the first, N-terminal domain (D1) of the receptors (13Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yan Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.-H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 16Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). There are large differences in the number of extracellular domains among the members of the subfamily, ranging from two in ICAM-2 and ICAM-4 to nine in ICAM-5. Most of the IgSF domains have N-linked glycans, and some are heavily glycosylated. The role of those glycans in receptor folding and ligand recognition is poorly understood. Ablation of the first N-linked glycosylation site in ICAM-3 disrupted several antibody epitopes and LFA-1 recognition, whereas deletion of other glycans in the first domain had no effect on ligand binding (17Klickstein L.B. York M.B. de Fougerolles A.R. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23920-23927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutation of several N-linked glycans in the second domain of ICAM-1 had small effects on LFA-1 binding (16Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the glycosylated N-terminal two domains of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 showed the location of the glycans in the IgSF domains (18Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. Liu J.-H. Harrison S.C. Wang J.-H. Nature. 1997; 387: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.-H. Wang J.-H. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The conformation of the first and in some cases the second GlcNAc residue of the chitobiose core was defined by the electron density maps (see Fig. 1). No traceable electron density was observed for the third mannose residues in the N-linked glycans, suggesting their high flexibility. The distribution of the N-linked glycans differs in ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 (see Fig. 1). In ICAM-2 the glycans linked to the two IgSF domains distribute around the ICAM-2 molecule (see Fig. 1C), whereas in ICAM-1 they locate on two opposite sides of the second domain (see Fig. 1D). The glycans are linked to the bottom of the domains in ICAM-2 and have a tripod-like distribution in the second domain (see Fig. 1, A and C), suggesting that they can be used to orient the receptor molecule on the cell surface (18Casasnovas J.M. Springer T.A. Liu J.-H. Harrison S.C. Wang J.-H. Nature. 1997; 387: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In ICAM-1 the first domain lacks N-linked glycans (Fig. 1B), providing additional interacting surfaces for cis-dimerization and nonintegrin ligands, such as human rhinovirus (HRV) and Plasmodium falciparum-derived proteins (19Casasnovas J.M.

Here we report and discuss the contribution of the N-linked glycosylation to protein conformation and ligand recognition in members of the ICAM subfamily of adhesion receptors. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 was carried by the overlap PCR technique using PfuI polymerase (Stratagene) and the cDNAs cloned in the unique XbaI site of pAprM9 (12Casasnovas J.M.

Mutants were subcloned either in the pAprM9 vector for cell surface expression or in the pEF vector (27Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) for the preparation of soluble proteins. Cell Surface Expression and Binding Assays with Antibodies, LFA-1, and HRV—Wild type and mutant ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 proteins were expressed on the surface of COS cells. Transfections using the DEAE-dextran method were essentially as described (12Casasnovas J.M. Pieroni C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3017-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Each experiment included transfection with 0.1-8.0 μg of wild type and 6 μg of mutant DNAs. Antibody binding to ICAM molecules on the cell surface was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorter). About 1 × 105 cells were incubated with anti-ICAM antibodies at 10 μg/ml. The percentage of cells expressing antibody epitopes was determined after subtraction of background staining from cells mock transfected with pAprM9 (12Casasnovas J.M. Pieroni C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3017-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A cell binding assay with purified and plastic coated LFA-1 was carried out as described in detail elsewhere (12Casasnovas J.M. Pieroni C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The percentage of transfected cells bound to LFA-1 was determined for wild type and mutant ICAM molecules and corrected by the subtraction of background binding of mock transfected cells. Virus binding to transfected cells was done with 35S-labeled HRV3 and 14 (28Martin S. Casasnovas J.M. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells (1 × 105 cells/well) with wild type (2-8 μg) and mutant (4 μg) recombinant cDNAs were reseeded 48 h post-transfection into 96-well plates and cultured 24 h at 37 °C. [35S]HRV3 or HRV14 (2 × 104 cpm) in 80 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 5% fetal calf serum were added in duplicate to wells and incubated for 1 h at 35 °C. In antibody blocking experiments, cells were preincubated 15 min with the anti-ICAM-1 RR1/1 antibody (30 μg/ml) (16Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Virus solution was aspirated, and wells were washed two times with 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 5% fetal calf serum. Cells and bound viruses were harvested with 30 μl of 1% Triton X-100 and scintillation counted. Counts from virus bound to cells were corrected by background binding to mock transfected cells. A binding ratio was determined from the counts bound to cells expressing similar amounts of mutant and wild type ICAM-1 surface molecules, determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter with the anti-D4 monoclonal antibody CL203 (16Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Soluble Fc Fusion Protein Preparation—Fusion proteins were engineered by cloning the ICAM cDNA coding for the indicated domains upstream of the human IgG1-Fc (Fc) genomic DNA in the mammalian expression vector pEF. They comprise mature protein residues 1-187 of ICAM-1 (IC1-2D), residues 1-193 of ICAM-2 (IC2-2D), and residues 1-86 or 189 of ICAM-3 (IC3-1D or IC3-2D). A control IgSF fusion protein (Ig) was prepared with the cDNA coding for the N-terminal two domains of Nectin-1 (23Campadelli-Fiume G. Cocchi F. Menotti L. Lopez M. Rev. Med. Virol. 2000; 10: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Proteins were transiently expressed in 293T cells transfected with the calcium phosphate method. The Ig-Lec protein was prepared from Chinese hamster ovary Lec 3.2.8.1 cells using the glutamine synthetase expression system (25Casasnovas J.M. Bickford J.K. Springer T.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6244-6246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein secretion into the cell supernatant was monitored and quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with antibodies against the Fc region (DAKO). Purified Fc protein of known concentration was used as standard to determine protein concentration in supernatants, which ranged from about 20-100 μg/ml. DC-SIGN Preparation—The DC-SIGN lectin domain was expressed using a bacterial system. A recombinant cDNA coding for the DC-SIGN lectin domain (residues Glu250-Leu392) was cloned in the NheI and XhoI sites of the vector pET-27b (+) (Novagen). Protein expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells formed inclusion bodies. Urea solubilized protein under denaturing conditions (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 8 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was subjected to refolding in vitro by 1:100 dilution into refolding buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 400 mm l-arginine, 2 mm EDTA, 6.3 mm cysteamine, 3.7 mm cystamine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein solution (1 liter) was concentrated to 3 ml and run through a Superdex-75 (Amersham Biosciences) size exclusion column in Tris-buffer, pH 8.0, with 100 mm NaCl. DC-SIGN protein fractions coming out at the expected retention volume were pooled and run through a Hi-Trap Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Highly purified protein was eluted from the ion-exchange column with 250 mm NaCl in Tris-buffer, pH 8.0. The purified protein was recognized by the anti-DC-SIGN MR-1 monoclonal antibody (29Relloso M. Puig-Kro ̈ger A. Mun ̃iz-Pello O. Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. de la Rosa G. Longo N. Navarro J. Mun ̃oz-Fernandez M.A. Sanchez-Mateos P. Corbi A.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2634-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Binding of ICAMs to DC-SIGN—To analyze binding of ICAMs to DC-SIGN we designed an in vitro assay with plastic bound DC-SIGN and supernatants containing soluble Fc fusion proteins. 96-Well plates (Maxi Sorp, Nunc) were precoated with 50 μl of DC-SIGN (10 μg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, with 2.5 mm CaCl2 (binding buffer) overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, washed four times with binding buffer, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell supernatants with the Fc fusion proteins at about 25 μg/ml were diluted with 1% bovine serum albumin in binding buffer at concentrations from 25-1 μg/ml added to wells with coated DC-SIGN and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-Fc antibody (DAKO) diluted 1:500 in binding buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin was added to the wells. Binding was monitored by OD at 490 nm using a Benchmark reader (Bio-Rad). Endoglycosidase Treatment of ICAM-Fc Proteins and Analysis—Endoglycosidase H (endo-H, New England Biolabs) or enzyme buffer was added to supernatants (200 μl) with the Fc fusion proteins (20 μg/ml), and the mixture was incubated overnight at 30 °C. DC-SIGN binding to enzyme- and buffer-treated samples was carried as described above. Size change in the protein samples related to glycan hydrolysis was analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blotting. Endo-H-treated Fc proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C with protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were run in a 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After overnight blocking with 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline, the membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-Fc antibody (DAKO) and bound antibody detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The percentage of protein sensitive to endo-H was determined with a Fluor-S Multimager device (Bio-Rad). The fluorescence counts in the area corresponding to the endo-H sensitive or resistant protein fractions were determined in the tracks with samples treated with endo-H or buffer. The ratio between counts in the endo-H sensitive area and the total counts in the enzyme treated protein sample were determined and corrected by the background ratio determined from the buffer-treated protein. N-Linked Glycans in the ICAM Subfamily and Their Contribution to Receptor Expression and LFA-1 Recognition—The N-terminal two domains of all human ICAMs are heavily glycosylated with the number of N-linked glycans ranging from four in ICAM-1 and ICAM-4 to seven in ICAM-3 (Fig. 2). The first and last glycans, respectively, in β-strand B of domain 1 and β-strand G of domain 2 are highly conserved. The first glycan in ICAM-2 (glc1, Fig. 1, A and C) had the lowest temperature factor among all the glycans in the ICAM-2 structure (Table I), related to a particular contact with protein residues discussed below. The chitobiose core of the glycan in the β-strand G of the second domain of ICAM-1 (glc4, Fig. 1B) runs parallel to the protruding FG-loop in the ICAM-1 structure and is linked to the interdomain interface. The first GlcNAc stacks onto the side chain of Thr85 in all reported crystals structures (13Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yan Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J.

This glycan had the lowest temperature factor and therefore the lowest flexibility among glycans in the four molecular structures reported for the fully glycosylated ICAM-1 (13Shimaoka M. Xiao T.

Deletion of glc4 reduced expression of a soluble ICAM-1 with the two N-terminal domains and had some effect on LFA-1 binding (16Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A.

Dustin M.L. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 17Klickstein L.B. York M.B. de Fougerolles A.R. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23920-23927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although no data have been reported for ICAM-2. Glycans linked to the first domain of ICAM-2 are conserved in ICAM-3, but those in the second domain are not (Fig. 2). We deleted N-linked glycans in ICAM-2 to determine their contribution to protein processing and expression on the cell surface and to integrin LFA-1 recognition. Cellular expression was monitored with a panel of four monoclonal antibodies (Table I). Deletion of the conserved glc1 linked to N23 in ICAM-2 with anyone of three different mutations largely decreased receptor expression and LFA-1 binding. The effect observed here was even more marked than that reported for deletion of the homologous glycan in ICAM-3 (17Klickstein L.B. York M.B. de Fougerolles A.R. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23920-23927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Single deletion of any other glycan had only a marginal effect on ICAM-2 expression on the cell surface. LFA-1 binding to those mutants correlated with the level of expression, although deletion of glc2 and -4 slightly increased cell adhesion (Table I). Double mutations of glycans in the second domain further decreased receptor expression (Table I), whereas very low cell surface expression was monitored for the triple mutant (data not shown). A Conserved Glycan-Protein Motif in the Integrin Binding Domain of ICAMs—The crystal structure of glycosylated ICAM-2 showed several peculiarities for the conserved glc1 in ICAMs (Figs. 1 and 2). It locates in the middle region of the IgSF domain, differing from the remaining N-linked glycans in ICAM-2, which locate in the bottom of D1 and D2 (Figs. 1A and 3). It had the lowest temperature factor among all glycans (Table I), indicating restricted flexibility because of the interaction with a conserved protein residue (Fig. 3). The structure showed an evident contact between glc1 and the conserved W51 residue (Fig. 3), with the first GlcNAc stacking on the exposed aromatic ring of the side chain. Indeed, solvent accessible surface calculations with SURFACE (21Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar) showed that atoms within the first carbohydrate ring of glc1 were not solvent exposed (probe radius of 1.4-1.8 Å), differing from the other GlcNAc residues in the ICAM-2 structure, which were solvent-accessible (data not shown). Additionally, the methyl group of the first GlcNAc lays at ∼4 Å of the indole ring of His53 (Fig. 3). Because of those contacts, glc1, rather than project perpendicular to the main axis of the domain (see glc2 in Fig. 3), runs parallel to it toward the top of the first domain. Trp51 appears surrounded by the glycan on one side and the aliphatic side chains of Gln48 and Gln50 on the other side, preventing solvent exposure of all but 1 atom of the aromatic ring. Both glc1 and the interacting tryptophan residue (glycan-W motif) are highly conserved in the ICAM subfamily (Fig. 3, inset). All ICAMs except ICAM-1 from human and chimpanzee have the glycan-W motif, so it must have a conserved role in the subfamily. Mutation of either the glycan or the Trp residue in ICAM-2 reduced significantly both surface expression of the receptor and integrin binding (Table I). A similar phenotype was reported with human ICAM-3 (17Klickstein L.B. York M.B. de Fougerolles A.R. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23920-23927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), showing that the glycan-W motif is critical for the proper conformation of the integrin binding IgSF domain in the ICAM subfamily. Quite interestingly this motif evolved in primates, disappearing in humans. However, a mutant ICAM-1 molecule having the glycan-W motif (T20N/R49W) expressed on the cell surface as well as the wild type human ICAM-1 receptor, as monitored by the anti-D4 monoclonal antibody CL203 (Table II). LFA-1 binding was almost identical in the mutant and wild type ICAM-1 receptor molecules, showing proper folding of the domain for integrin recognition. Introduction of either the glycan or the Trp residue in ICAM-1 did not have a significant effect on expression, although some effect on integrin binding was observed for the T20N mutant (Table II).Table I"

Two critical findings were made. First, we found that p116Rip activated the GTPase activity of RhoA in vitro and that p116Rip overexpression in cells consistently diminished the epidermal growth factor-induced increase in GTP-bound RhoA. Second, p116Rip activated the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) activity of the holoenzyme. p116Rip did not activate the catalytic subunit alone, indicating that the activation is due to the binding of p116Rip to the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1. Interestingly, the activation of phosphatase was specific to myosin as substrate, and p116Rip directly bound to myosin, thus facilitating myosin/MLCP interaction. The gene silencing of p116Rip consistently and significantly increased myosin phosphorylation as well as stress fiber formation in cells. Based upon these findings, we propose that p116Rip is an important regulatory component that controls the RhoA signaling pathway, thus regulating MLCP activity and myosin phosphorylation in cells. p116Rip was originally found to be a RhoA-binding protein, but its function has been unknown.

The actin-myosin system plays a fundamental role in the regulation of cell motility, including cell contractility, migration, division and shape changes. In vertebrates, the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain RLC20 regulates conventional myosin (myosin II) for both motor activity and filament formation (1Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 1. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar, 2Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev.

The extent of phosphorylation of myosin II is controlled by the change in the myosin light chain kinase and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) 1The abbreviations used are: MLCP, myosin light chain phosphatase; HMM, heavy meromyosin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PP1δ, protein phosphatase-1δ; DTT, dithiothreitol; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); RBD, Rho-binding domain; siRNA, small interfering RNA; X-α-gal, 15-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-galactopyranoside. activities. There are two pathways that regulate myosin phosphorylation. One is a Ca2+-dependent pathway. The increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ caused by external stimuli activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase, thus increasing myosin phosphorylation. The other is the Ca2+-independent pathway. This pathway regulates both myosin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes. It has been shown recently that several Ca2+-independent kinases can phosphorylate myosin in vitro (4Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

Among them, zipper-interacting protein kinase has been shown to play an important role in phosphorylating myosin in migrating mammalian cells (8Komatsu S. Ikebe M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a number of studies have revealed that MLCP is regulated by a RhoA signaling pathway (9Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar, 10Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). MLCP consists of three subunits: a myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1), a 20-kDa small subunit, and a catalytic subunit of the type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase family (11Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 12Shirazi A. Iizuka K. Fadden P. Mosse C. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V.

Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal one-third of the large subunit is composed of eight repeat sequences that correspond to the sequence for an ankyrin repeat, a motif that is found in proteins involved in tissue differentiation and cell cycle and cytoskeleton regulation (14Michaely P. Bennett V. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 127-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The domain responsible for the binding of MYPT1 to myosin has been studied. Ichikawa et al. (15Ichikawa K. Hirano K. Ito M. Tanaka J. Nakano T. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6313-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that the recombinant N-terminal two-thirds of MYPT1 contain the myosin-binding site because phosphorylated heavy meromyosin (HMM) and RLC20 bound to an affinity column made using this recombinant fragment. On the other hand, Johnson et al. (16Johnson D. Cohen P. Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that the C-terminal 291 residues of the large subunit, but not the N-terminal fragment, bind to myosin. Although the identity of the myosin-binding domain of MLCP remains controversial, it is generally agreed that the large subunit is the myosin targeting subunit. The interaction of the subunits of MLCP has been studied. Johnson et al. (16Johnson D. Cohen P. Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that the 20-kDa subunit does not interact with the catalytic subunit, but does interact with the C-terminal 72 residues of MYPT1. Hirano et al. (17Hirano K. Phan B.C. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3683-3688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) reported that the catalytic subunit binds to MYPT1 at two sites: a relatively strong site in the N-terminal 38 residues and a weaker site in the ankyrin repeat (residues 39–295). The phosphorylated light chain-binding site is also assigned to the ankyrin repeat. The existence of several isoforms of the type I phosphatase catalytic subunit has been demonstrated (α1, α2, γ1, γ2, and δ) (18Dombradi V. Axton J.M. da Brewis N.D. Cruz e Silva E.F. Alphey L.

J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the substrate specificity and regulation of protein phosphatases are governed by their regulatory subunits and that the regulatory subunits act as targeting subunits (21Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For MLCP, it is known that its holoenzyme has higher activity than its catalytic subunit (11Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 12Shirazi A. Iizuka K. Fadden P. Mosse C. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Haystead T.A. J. Biol.

(22Gong M.C. Fuglsang A. Alessi D. Kobayashi S. Cohen P. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21492-21498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the inhibition of MLCP by a high arachidonic acid concentration is due to the dissociation of the catalytic subunit from the holoenzyme. A critical finding that shed light on the linkage between RhoA and its downstream cascade was the discovery of Rho-dependent protein kinase (referred to as Rho kinase). Rho kinase was cloned from various tissues (23Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S.

The kinase (∼160 kDa) is composed of several domains, including a catalytic domain, a coiled-coil domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a cysteine-rich zinc finger motif that is homologous to the cysteine-rich domains of protein kinase C (24Matsui T.

Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was shown that MYPT1 can be phosphorylated by Rho kinase, which results in a decrease in MLCP activity in vitro (26Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). Rho kinase phosphorylates MYPT1 at two sites in vitro, i.e. Thr641 and Thr799, with Thr641 responsible for the inhibition of MLCP activity (27Feng J. Ito M. Ichikawa K. Isaka N. Nishikawa M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37385-37390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). This suggests that activation of the RhoA signaling pathway would phosphorylate MYPT1 by Rho kinase, thus down-regulating MLCP and increasing myosin motor function. It may be asked whether an external stimulus induces the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr641. Quite recently, it was shown that during agonist-induced stimulation in smooth muscle, the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr641 was unchanged, whereas RLC20 phosphorylation was significantly increased (28Niiro N. Koga Y. Ikebe M. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This suggests that MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr641 is not responsible for the change in myosin phosphorylation in smooth muscle contractile regulation, although it may play a role in other cell motility systems. A critical question is how the RhoA signaling pathway regulates MLCP activity, thus myosin phosphorylation. To address this question, we studied the MYPT1-interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. One of the positive clones is a p116Rip, previously found to be a RhoA-interacting protein (29Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It was reported that overexpression of p116Rip attenuates lysophosphatidic acid-induced cell shape change, suggesting that p116Rip might inhibit RhoA function. The mechanism by which p116Rip attenuates the lysophosphatidic acid-induced cell shape change is unclear. Quite recently, Surks et al. (30Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that p116Rip interacts with MYPT1. To date, the function of p116Rip has not been understood. Here, we found that p116Rip activates MLCP activity. The activation is achieved by p116Rip facilitation of the binding of MYPT1 to myosin. Furthermore, we found that p116Rip has RhoGAP activity, thus inactivating RhoA activity. The gene silencing of p116Rip consistently and significantly increased myosin phosphorylation in cells. Based upon these findings, we propose that p116Rip is an important regulatory component that controls the RhoA signaling pathway, thus regulating MLCP activity and myosin phosphorylation in cells. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 3 (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast AH109 strains were sequentially transformed with the pGBKT7 vector, coding for full-length rat MYPT1 with a leucine zipper fused in-frame to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, and then with a human aorta cDNA library constructed in the pACT2 vector, coding for the activation domain of Gal4. Initial transformants were selected as being positive on synthetic complete plates lacking tryptophan/leucine/histidine/adenine and containing 15-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal) on the surface of the plates. Vector and cDNA Constructs—The coding sequence for the Rho-binding domain of rhotekin (amino acids 7–89) was amplified from a mouse trachea RNA preparation by reverse transcription-PCR and subcloned into the pGEX4T2 vector. The cDNAs were generated from total RNA of human trachea by reverse transcription-PCR and used as template to generate a full-length p116Rip cDNA (DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI accession number AB189741). Amplified PCR products were subcloned into pFBHT containing a FLAG tag at the N terminus or the pEGFP vector. The entire coding region of rat MYPT1 cDNA was subcloned into pFBHTc at the SalI site.

(Tokyo). 1979; 85: 457-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recombinant MLCP holoenzyme was purified by co-infecting Sf9 cells with viruses expressing rat His-MYPT1 with a leucine zipper, rat PP1δ, and rat M21 as described previously (37Takizawa N. Koga Y. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The expressed MLCP holoenzyme was purified by Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant p116Rip, MYPT1, RhoA, Rho kinase, and PP1δ were also purified following the same procedure. In Vitro Binding Assay—Ten μg of FLAG-tagged p116Rip was mixed with 10 μg of His-MYPT1 and/or 10 μg of His-RhoA in 30 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 4 °C. Ten μg of FLAG-tagged p116Rip was also mixed with 20 μg of Rho kinase under the same conditions. Anti-FLAG antibody-agarose was added to the mixture, and the mixture was incubated for another 30 min. Anti-FLAG antibody-agarose was washed three times with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma) in buffer containing 30 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. The bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting or Coomassie Blue staining. For the binding of p116Rip to myosin, 10 μg of FLAG-tagged p116Rip and 17.5 μg of unphosphorylated or phosphorylated myosin were mixed in buffer containing 30 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 4 °C. The bound proteins were determined as described above. Immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells attached to the culture dish were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were lysed through a 26-gauge needle. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resin was centrifuged to remove nonspecific binding proteins. The supernatants were incubated overnight with control IgG, anti-MYPT1 antibody, or anti-p116Rip antibody at 4 °C and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was precipitated, and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Quantitative Analysis of the Binding of p116Rip to MYPT1 or HMM—A fixed amount of FLAG-tagged p116Rip (0.25 μm) was incubated with various amounts of MYPT1 (0.125–3 μm) in 30 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 4 °C. The same amount of FLAG-tagged p116Rip (0.25 μm) was also incubated with various amounts of HMM (0.25–10 μm) in 30 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 4 °C. MYPT1 (3 μm) or HMM (10 μm) alone was incubated with anti-FLAG antibody-agarose as a control. The proteins bound to p116Rip were analyzed by Western blotting (for MYPT1) or Coomassie Blue staining (for HMM). To determine the amount of MYPT1 bound to p116Rip, various amounts of purified MYPT1 were also analyzed by Western blotting to serve as standards. The amount of MYPT1 or HMM bound to p116Rip was determined by densitometry and fit to a single rectangular hyperbola using Prism Version 4.0 software. Measurement of Protein Expression Levels in Cells—The homogenates of COS-7 cells were prepared as described above. Protein concentration was measured using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The standard curves were obtained with 2.5–10 ng of purified p116Rip and 15–25 ng of purified MYPT1, and the data was fit by linear regression. Approximately 40 μg of the total COS-7 cell lysates, which fell on the linear portion of the standard curves of p116Rip and MYPT1, was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. Protein Phosphatase and Kinase Assay—After incubation of smooth muscle myosin with 1 μm microcystin LR for 10 min at room temperature, myosin (5 mg/ml) was phosphorylated with 10 μg/ml myosin light chain kinase and 10 μg/ml calmodulin in buffer containing 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.1 μm microcystin LR at 25 °C for 30 min. The phosphorylated myosin was precipitated by adding 8 volumes of salt-free buffer containing 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, the precipitated myosin was dissolved with high salt buffer (0.4 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The precipitation-solubilization cycle was repeated again. The phosphorylated myosin was finally dissolved in high salt buffer at a concentration of 25 μm. MLC20 was also phosphorylated as described previously (34Ikebe M. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders C.R. Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28165-28172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated MLC20 was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates were washed three times with water and dissolved in 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT. Protein phosphatase assays were carried out at 25 °C using [γ-32P]ATP-labeled myosin or MLC20 (final concentration of 3 or 0.75 μm, respectively) as substrate in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 nm MLCP or 20 nm PP1δ. MLCP at 10 nm was used when phospho-MLC20 was used as substrate. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After sedimentation of the proteins at 5000 × g for 5 min, Cerenkov counting was performed to determine the radioactivity of the supernatant containing the liberated 32P. A protein kinase assay was performed as described previously (28Niiro N. Koga Y. Ikebe M. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). GTP Hydrolysis of RhoA—RhoA (3 μm) was first loaded with 10 μm [γ-32P]GTP in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 30 °C for 10 min. GTP hydrolysis was initiated by incubating the [γ-32P]GTP-bound RhoA with or without p116Rip in the above buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm GTP, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated at 10 min by adding 20 volumes of ice-cold dilution buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. The diluted samples were immediately filtered through 25-mm BA85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schüll) and washed with 5 ml of ice-cold dilution buffer. The filters were assessed for radioactivity using a Beckman scintillation counter. RhoGEF Assay—RhoA (10 μm) was loaded with GDP (50 μm) as described above. The GDP-loaded RhoA was incubated with or without p116Rip (2 μm) at 30 °C in GDP-GTP exchange factor assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 μm [γ-35S]GTPγS. The reaction was terminated and filtered as described above. Rhotekin Binding Assay—HeLa cells were mock-transfected or transfected with a p116Rip-expressing vector for 24 h and serum-starved for 48 h. Approximately 70% of the total cells were mock- or p116Rip-transfected. The transfected cells were treated with 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. RhoA activity was assessed at the indicated times using the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of rhotekin as described (38Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were incubated with GSH-RBD beads (8 μg) at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed three times with Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bound RhoA proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. Preparation and Transfection of Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The selected sequences were submitted to a BLAST search to ensure that only the p116Rip gene was targeted. p116Rip siRNA1 (AATGGCAGCGACGGTTCTT, corresponding to bp 203–221 of p116Rip) and p116Rip siRNA2 (AATTGACTTGTCCGCATGT, corresponding to bp 1290–1308 of p116Rip) were used. A pair of 67-nucleotide complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized separately with the addition of a BamHI site to the 5′-end and an EcoRI site to the 3′-end. The annealed 67-bp cDNA fragment with p116Rip siRNA was cloned into the pSIREN-DNR-DsRed vector (BD Knockout RNAi Systems, Clontech), which has two promoter regions for producing siRNA and DsRed, respectively. Negative control oligonucleotides were obtained from the RNAi-ready pSIREN-DNR-DsRed express kit (Clontech). Transfection of pSIREN vectors into HeLa cells was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Immunofluorescence Staining and Image Processing—Two different anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used for the independent localization of p116Rip and MYPT1 as described previously (39Lynch R.M. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were incubated with anti-rabbit MYPT1 polyclonal antibody, followed by Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and unlabeled anti-rabbit IgG to block anti-rabbit MYPT1 antibody. This blocking step assured that all free sites for anti-rabbit IgG interaction were covered before the second series of polyclonal and secondary labeled antibodies. After this blocking step, cells were incubated sequentially with anti-rabbit p116Rip polyclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. As a control, fluorescein isothiocyanate labeling was observed after the deletion of the second polyclonal antibody, providing a measure of the efficacy of the blocking step. Actin filaments were stained with phalloidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 546 during the incubation with the second secondary antibody. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (8Komatsu S. Ikebe M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Komatsu S. Yano T. Shibata M. Tuft R.A.

All images were taken with the same laser output to directly compare the fluorescence signal intensities. Images were processed using Adobe® Photoshop® Version 7.0 software. Binding of p116Rip to MYPT1—The interaction between p116Rip and MYPT1 was found by yeast two-hybrid screening (Fig. 1A). The entire coding region of rat MYPT1 was used as bait, and the positive clones were subjected to X-α-gal assay to eliminate false positive clones. Two of the positive clones, TM3 and TM15, encoded bp 1840–3111 and 1459–3111 of human p116Rip, respectively (Fig. 1A). The binding between p116Rip, RhoA, and MYPT1 was studied. GFP-tagged p116Rip expressed in COS-7 cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies. The immunoprecipitated complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). MYPT1 was co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-p116Rip using anti-GFP antibodies, but not control IgG (Fig. 1B, left panels). Co-immunoprecipitation of p116Rip with GFP-MYPT1 using anti-GFP antibodies was also observed with the cell lysates expressing GFP"
https://openalex.org/W1971727732,"Rearrangement of RNA secondary structure is crucial for numerous biological processes. RNA helicases participate in these rearrangements through the unwinding of duplex RNA. We report here that the redox-regulated cyanobacterial RNA helicase, CrhR, is a bona fide RNA helicase possessing both RNA-stimulated ATPase and bidirectional ATP-stimulated RNA helicase activity. The processivity of the unwinding reaction appears to be low, because RNA substrates containing duplex regions of 41 bp are not unwound. CrhR also catalyzes the annealing of complementary RNA into intermolecular duplexes. Uniquely and in contrast to other proteins that perform annealing, the CrhR-catalyzed reactions require ATP hydrolysis. Through a combination of the unwinding and annealing activities, CrhR also catalyzes RNA strand exchange resulting in the formation of RNA secondary structures that are too stable to be resolved by helicase activity. RNA strand exchange most probably occurs through the CrhR-dependent formation and resolution of an RNA branch migration structure. Demonstration that another cyanobacterial RNA helicase, CrhC, does not catalyze annealing indicates that this activity is not a general biochemical characteristic of RNA helicases.

The ability of organisms to rearrange nucleic acid secondary structure is crucial for cellular function and is catalyzed by a diverse range of proteins or protein complexes that facilitate nucleic acid annealing and unwinding. Two protein families, nucleic acid-binding proteins and helicases, catalyze these reactions. RNA-binding proteins are structurally unrelated to helicases (1Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 2Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Helicases have been classified into five major groups based on characteristic amino acid motifs with the two largest families, superfamilies 1 and 2, composed of RNA and DNA helicases (5Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). The other helicase families include proteins possessing fewer conserved motifs and having different substrate specificities. Biochemically, helicases function as ATP-driven molecular motors, catalyzing NTP-dependent nucleic acid duplex destabilization or strand displacement (6Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M.

An alternative mechanism by which RNA structural rearrangements can be effected involves the concerted interaction of an RNA helicase with an RNA-binding protein, examples of which include eIF-4A/B (11Altmann M. Wittmer B. Methot N. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3820-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Brr2/Prp24 (12Raghunathan P.L. Guthrie C. Curr.

These complexes catalyze the interconversion between dsRNA and ssRNA by coupling RNA helicase and annealing activity. Annealing requires the RNA binding domain and not ATP, indicating that the reaction results from chaperone activity (14Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These reactions resemble bacteriophage DNA helicases that catalyze DNA strand exchange in cooperation with a ssDNA-binding protein (15Kong D. Nossal N.G. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8380-8387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has become clear that helicases are related both structurally and mechanistically (1Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 2Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct.

These similarities extend to the apparently unrelated proteins, RecA and the AAA+ protein, RuvB, involved in the rearrangement of dsDNA secondary structure through a combination of DNA unwinding and annealing, promoting branch migration through Holliday junctions. These structural similarities may also indicate functional similarities, suggesting the potential for other members of the helicase superfamily to both unwind and anneal complementary nucleic acid templates. In this report, we characterized the biochemical activities of the RNA helicase, CrhR, from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. CrhR expression is regulated by the redox status of the electron transport chain with crhR transcript accumulating in response to reduction of the electron transport chain between QA in photosystem II and QO in cyt b6f (18Kujat S.L. Owttrim G.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These components are reduced in response to electron flow derived from either photosynthetic light harvesting or respiration of exogenously provided carbon. We proposed that CrhR-catalyzed modulation of RNA secondary structure is involved in the regulation of redox-induced gene expression. Therefore, it was of interest to examine the biochemical activities possessed by CrhR with respect to the structural rearrangement of RNA secondary structure. Characterization of the ability of recombinant CrhR to catalyze these rearrangements indicated that, similar to other RNA helicases, CrhR possesses RNA-stimulated ATPase and bidirectional RNA helicase activity. CrhR also catalyzes annealing of complementary RNA into dsRNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. CrhR rearrangement of RNA secondary structure also extended to RNA strand exchange activity, most probably through the formation and resolution of RNA branch migration complexes. The results indicate that, in vitro, CrhR catalyzes complex RNA secondary structure rearrangements through the coupling of helicase and annealing activities, producing RNA structures that are too stable to be resolved by helicase activity alone. Expression and Purification of Recombinant CrhR RNA Helicase—An N-terminal translational fusion between a His tag and the CrhR ORF was generated by ligation of two DNA fragments coding for crhR into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pRSET A (Invitrogen). A 2.1-kbp DraI/EcoRI fragment corresponding to bp 2888247–2890397 of the Synechocystis genome (19Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar) coding for the 3′-crhR ORF and untranslated region was obtained from an EcoRI fragment containing the entire crhR ORF (18Kujat S.L. Owttrim G.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A 5′ fragment comprising bp 2887644–2888246 of the genome was generated by PCR using primers 5′-CGAACGGATCCATGACTA-3′ and 5′-GCGGGATCCGAATTCGGTG-3′. The first primer generated a BamHI site required for the translational fusion, the ATG being the wild type translational start codon for CrhR while the second primer spanned an internal DraI site within the crhR ORF (18Kujat S.L. Owttrim G.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sequencing confirmed the translational fusion and sequence of the 5′-BamHI/DraI region. JM109 transformants were grown in LB-Amp100 medium to A600 nm = 0.6 at 37 °C and recombinant protein expression induced by the addition of phage (M13/T7(DE3), 5 plaque-forming unit/cell, Invitrogen) and IPTG (0.5 mm) for 1.5–2 h. To purify the His6-CrhR recombinant protein, frozen cell pellets were resuspended in one-tenth volume lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) and disrupted by ultrasonication. When indicated, clarified supernatants were treated with RNase (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h. The clarified supernatant was passed over a Ni-NTA column, and unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing with lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with 75, 125, and 250 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. Protein obtained from the final imidazole elution was stored in 30% glycerol at –80 °C. CrhR remained active under these conditions for at least 1 month. Imidazole did not affect CrhR enzymatic activity. When required, recombinant His6-CrhC was expressed and purified as described for CrhR (20Yu E. Owttrim G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3926-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). RNA Substrates—ssRNA was produced by run-off transcription from linear plasmids carrying partially complementary DNA inserts using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase as described by Yu and Owttrim (20Yu E. Owttrim G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3926-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One strand (41 nt for the 5′-tailed substrate and 103 nt for the 3′-tailed substrate) was uniformly labeled with [α-32P]UTP, whereas the other strand (68 nt for 5′-tailed substrate and 107 nt for the 3′-tailed substrate) was unlabeled. After purification by denaturing urea gel electrophoresis, ∼150 pmol of each ssRNA was annealed with an equimolar amount of its non-labeled partial complement in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and slow cooling to room temperature in a heating block. Partially duplexed RNA substrates containing only 5′-ssRNA (see Fig. 2A) or 3′-ssRNA tails (see Fig. 3A) were purified by electrophoresis on 8% native polyacrylamide gels, visualized by autoradiography, and eluted overnight at 4 °C in 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. For RNA strand exchange assays, the 5′-tailed dsRNA possessing 14 bp of complementary region and an unlabeled 174-nt ssRNA complementary to the labeled strand over 41 nt were used as the substrates. The 174-nt RNA was produced by T7 RNA polymerase transcription from RsaI-cleaved pGEMMO1/2 and purified by denaturing urea gel electrophoresis. ATPase Assays—ATPase activities were continuously monitored using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (21Iost I. Dreyfus M. Linder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17677-17683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The assay uses pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase to link ATP hydrolysis to NADH oxidation, resulting in a reduction in absorbance at 338 nm. Unless otherwise stated, ATPase assays were performed at 37 °C in a 0.4-ml reaction volume containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 3 mm Mg acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.3 mm NADH, 10 μg of poly(A) RNA, 3 units/ml pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.2 μg of purified recombinant CrhR. Reactions were performed in duplicate in 96-well microtiter plates, and the change in A338 nm was continuously measured for 10 min using a SpectraMAX Plus spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The rate of ATP hydrolysis over the linear portion of the curve was quantified using 6300 m–1 cm–1 for the extinction coefficient of NADH, because the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis equals that of NADH oxidation. RNA Helicase Assay—RNA unwinding assays were performed as described previously (20Yu E. Owttrim G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3926-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, reactions were performed for 15 min at 37 °C in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.3, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 fmol of partially duplexed RNA, and 80 ng of recombinant CrhR. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 5 μl of stop solution (150 mm EDTA, 3% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 15% Ficoll). Reaction products (10 μl) were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and radioactive RNA was visualized by autoradiography. In all of the assays, the reactions denoted by ds and ss contained either dsRNA or ssRNA substrates incubated in complete reaction media minus protein for the entire experiment to control for spontaneous unwinding or annealing of the substrates. When indicated, the percentage of the input dsRNA substrate unwound to ssRNA was calculated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. RNA Annealing and Strand Exchange Assays—RNA annealing assays were performed exactly as described for the helicase assays with the exception that two complementary ssRNAs were utilized as the substrate and the reaction was performed at pH 7.0. The ssRNA substrates were obtained by heat denaturation of either the 5′- or 3′-dsRNAs for 5 min at 90 °C followed by snap-cooling on ice. Strand exchange assays also corresponded to the RNA helicase reactions with the exception that 80 fmol of a third unlabeled 174-nt ssRNA strand, partially complementary to the radiolabeled strand of the 5′-tailed dsRNA, was included in the reaction. Strand exchange products containing the 174-nt RNA strand will generate a partially duplexed RNA containing 41 bp of duplexed region (Fig. 5A, 41-bp RNA).Fig. 2CrhR possesses ATP-dependent 5′ to 3′ dsRNA unwinding activity. A, schematic of the artificial dsRNA target possessing only 5′-ssRNA tails (14-bp RNA). The asterisk indicates the 32P-labeled strand. Helicase activity, indicated by conversion of the 5′-dsRNA substrate (ds) to the 5′-ssRNA product (ss) by CrhR was determined with respect to increases in time (40 ng of CrhR) (B), protein (C), and ATP (80 ng of CrhR) (D) concentration. Note the reversal in the efficiency of unwinding at higher protein and ATP concentrations. The graph insert in B indicates the percentage of the total dsRNA substrate that has been unwound to ssRNA obtained by phosphorimaging analysis of the data presented. E, the nucleotide dependence of the unwinding reaction was tested in the presence of 3 mm of the indicated nucleotides. F, RNA unwinding is inhibited by incubation with anti-CrhR antibody. The addition of increasing amounts of polyclonal anti-CrhR antibody (18Kujat S.L. Owttrim G.W.

A, the substrate RNAs (14-bp RNA and the 174-nt RNA) and potential reactions involved in a strand exchange mechanism. The reaction may proceed through either an intramolecular reaction via branch migration (top scenario) or via an intermolecular reaction in which helicase activity is followed sequentially by annealing (bottom scenario). B, ATP- and CrhR-dependent strand exchange catalyzed by CrhR. Strand exchange reactions were performed as described for unwinding assays with the exception that a third 174-nt ssRNA (80 fmol) was included in the reaction. This RNA has 41 nt complementary to the radioactive strand of the 5′-tailed RNA. C, annealing/strand exchange catalyzed by CrhR from ssRNA. Reactions were performed similar to those described in B with the exception that the 5′-tailed dsRNA was heat-denatured before addition to the assay. CrhR (80 ng) and RNA concentration derived from the 5′-tailed substrate (50 fmol) were kept constant, whereas the 174-nt ssRNA was varied from 42 to 1700 fmol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western Blot Analysis—Chemiluminescence was used to detect CrhR in the indicated Escherichia coli extracts after separation on 10% SDS-PAGE and transfer to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose as described previously (22El-Fahmawi B. Owttrim G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Anti-CrhR (18Kujat S.L. Owttrim G.W. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and secondary antibodies (Sigma) were used at dilutions of 1:5000 and 1:20,000, respectively. Expression and Purification of Recombinant His-tagged CrhR RNA Helicase—The CrhR open reading frame was cloned as a recombinant fusion protein containing a N-terminal His6 tag expressed in E. coli JM109 following IPTG induction and affinity-purified over a Ni-NTA column (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–5). A single polypeptide of the expected molecular weight was observed by Coomassie Blue staining. The identity of the recombinant protein was verified as CrhR by Western blot (Fig. 1B) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown). ATPase Activity of CrhR RNA Helicase Is Stimulated by ssRNA and dsRNA but Not DNA—The RNA dependence of CrhR-catalyzed ATPase activity was determined by coupling ATP hydrolysis with NADH oxidation, the slope being proportional to the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The effects of a representative range of additions to the assay are shown in Table I. CrhR specifically catalyzed ATP hydrolysis as immunodepletion of CrhR effectively abolished the activity. A low level of activity, 2–3-fold above that present in the boiled CrhR control, was observed in the presence of RNase (+ RNase), suggesting that CrhR possesses a low level of intrinsic ATPase activity that is RNA-independent, similar to that reported for p68 (23Huang Y. Liu Z-R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12810-12815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the reaction was RNA-stimulated as activity was stimulated 6–12-fold by a variety of RNAs. Unexpectedly, ATPase activity was detected in the absence of exogenous RNA, a level that was reduced to background by treatment of E. coli extracts with RNase before affinity purification (– RNA). Thus, CrhR-catalyzed ATPase activity differs from other helicases in that E. coli RNA, which remains associated with CrhR during purification, stimulates the activity. In contrast, none of the DNA substrates significantly promoted activity, the low level observed presumably resulting from contaminating RNA. In fact, the significant reduction in ATPase activity in the absence of RNase treatment suggests that DNA acts as a protein trap. ATP and dATP were the only nucleotides that stimulated ATPase activity. Km values of 0.58 mm, 0.36 mm, and 0.14 μg were obtained for ATP, Mg2+, and poly(A), respectively. The Vmax values ranged from 7.9 to 10.0 μmol of ATP/min/mg protein, corresponding to an ATP turnover number of 452–573 μmol of ATP/min/μmol protein. Therefore, CrhR exhibits RNA-stimulated ATPase activity characteristic of RNA helicases.Table IInfluence of various components on CrhR ATPase activityATPase activityAdditionNon-RNased CrhRRNased CrhRμmol/min/μmol CrhRImmunodepleted CrhR59.7 ± 0.534.4 ± 4.9+ RNase38.0 ± 4.030.7 ± 6.5- RNA245.9 ± 4.741.6 ± 4.2Synechocystis Total RNA398.0 ± 9.6177.2 ± 21.7Yeast tRNA240.5 ± 2.4256.8 ± 34.4ATP468.4 ± 48.8475.6 ± 27.1dATP441.2 ± 1.8464.8 ± 43.4GTP12.7 ± 0.70.1 ± 1.6Synechocystis genomic DNA75.9 ± 41.647.1 ± 5.8Poly(dA)63.3 ± 21.757.9 ± 25.3 Open table in a new tab Recombinant CrhR RNA Helicase Catalyzes ATP-dependent dsRNA Unwinding in the 5′ → 3′ Direction—To determine the ability of CrhR to unwind dsRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction, an artificial RNA substrate containing only 5′-ssRNA tails and an internal 14-bp duplex region was constructed (Fig. 2A, 14-bp RNA) (20Yu E. Owttrim G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3926-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The unwinding of this substrate can only occur if CrhR is moving through the duplex region in the 5′ to 3′ direction. Recombinant CrhR unwound this dsRNA substrate progressively with respect to time at a constant CrhR concentration as indicated by quantification of the percentage of dsRNA unwound to ssRNA at each time point (Fig. 2B, insert). Unexpectedly, CrhR did not unwind this RNA substrate in a linear manner in response to alterations in either protein or ATP concentration (Fig. 2, C and D). In both cases, unwinding initially increased and then decreased. Reversal of the reaction may result from either a reduction in free Mg2+ caused by elevated ATP concentrations or RNA annealing activity. The RNA species migrating with a mobility identical to that of the dsRNA substrate was sensitive to heat denaturation, indicating that it did not represent an irreversibly altered RNA. ATP significantly enhanced the unwinding reaction, indicating that CrhR has an ATP-dependent helicase activity (Fig. 2D). As observed with the ATPase reaction, an examination of the nucleotide requirements for unwinding revealed a strong dependence on adenosine nucleotides with reduced activity observed with the other deoxynucleotides or ribonucleotides tested (Fig. 2E). ATP hydrolysis and not simply ATP binding was required for the reaction, as the slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogue ATPγS (Sigma) competitively inhibited the reaction in the presence of ATP (data not shown). Evidence that CrhR catalyzed unwinding was provided by the observation that progressive removal of CrhR by immunoprecipitation resulted in a corresponding reduction in unwinding activity (Fig. 2F). In addition, unwinding was not catalyzed by nonspecific protein, because each reaction contained bovine serum albumin (10 μg). CrhR Possesses ATP-stimulated 3′–5′-dsRNA Unwinding Activity—To determine whether CrhR unwinds RNA substrates in the 3′ to 5′ direction, an artificial partially duplexed RNA containing only 3′-ssRNA tails and an internal complementary region of 25 bp were constructed (Fig. 3A, 25-bp RNA) (20Yu E. Owttrim G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3926-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CrhR unwound this substrate with respect to time and protein concentration in an ATP-stimulated reaction, having kinetics similar to those observed with the 5′-tailed substrate (Fig. 3, B–D). Again, unwinding initially increased and then decreased as the concentration of ATP increased (Fig. 3D). Investigation of the nucleotide requirements for 3′-tailed dsRNA unwinding indicated that ATP most efficiently enhanced the reaction, whereas the other nucleotides were less effective (data not shown). Recombinant CrhR RNA Helicase Anneals ssRNA into dsRNA—In the helicase assays, progressive decreases in detectable unwinding activity were observed, suggesting that CrhR possessed the capacity to anneal complementary ssRNA strands. Therefore, annealing reactions were performed similar to helicase assays with the exception that the RNA substrate consisted of complementary ssRNAs obtained by heat denaturation of either the 5′-or3′-tailed dsRNAs (see Figs. 2A and 3A) and the reactions were performed at pH 7.0. Indeed, CrhR-dependent annealing of both pairs of complementary RNAs was observed with the results for the 5′- and 3′-tailed substrates being essentially identical (Fig. 4, A and B). At reduced CrhR concentration, the formation of an RNA species having a mobility identical to that of the 5′- or 3′-dsRNA was observed, presumably as a result of annealing of the complementary ssRNA substrates (Fig. 4, A and B). As CrhR protein concentration increased, the extent of RNA annealing decreased until only ssRNA substrate was present, presumably as a result of helicase activity. Significant levels of spontaneous annealing of either complementary ssRNA pair were not observed in control reactions in the absence of either CrhR or ATP (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 2, 9, and 10). In these experiments, annealing activity appeared to be protein concentration-dependent with annealing and helicase activity predominating at low and high protein concentrations, respectively. Annealing kinetics were complex, because annealing was also observed at elevated protein and ATP concentrations in Fig. 2, C and D, when the concentration of ssRNA templates was also elevated. A potential explanation for the apparent differences resides in the RNA substrates present in Figs. 2 and 4, with only dsRNA or ssRNA, respectively, creating different dsRNA:ssRNA ratios. Clearly, in all of the experiments, there was a narrow window between which annealing or helicase activity was catalyzed by CrhR. An important question was whether the annealing reaction was ATP-independent. In contrast to the previously reported cases of RNA annealing, CrhR-catalyzed annealing was ATP-dependent because dsRNA products were not observed in reactions lacking ATP (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 9 and 10). Informatively, we frequently observed an RNA species of reduced mobility after heat denaturation of the 3′-substrate (Fig. 4B, lanes ss, 3–7, and 9). This RNA apparently corresponds to a partial duplex create"
https://openalex.org/W2107898296,"We examined the kinetics of Gαs and Gαi regulation of human type V and type VI adenylyl cyclase (AC V and AC VI) in order to better model interactions between AC and its regulators. Activation of AC VI by Gαs displayed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, whereas AC V activation by Gαs was cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 1.4. The basal activity of human AC V, but not that of AC VI, was inhibited by Gαi. Both enzymes showed greater inhibition by Gαi at low Gαs concentrations; however, human AC V was activated by Gαi at high Gαs concentrations. Neither regulator had an effect on the Km for Mg-ATP. Mutations made within the Gαs binding pocket of AC V (N1090D) and VI (F1078S) displayed 6- and 14-fold greater EC50 values for Gαs activation but had no effect on Gαi inhibition of basal activity or Km for Mg-ATP. Gαs-stimulated AC VI-F1078S was not significantly inhibited by Gαi, despite normal inhibition by Gαi upon forskolin stimulation. Mechanistic models for Gαs and Gαi regulation of AC V and VI were derived to describe these results. Our models are consistent with previous studies, predicting a decrease in affinity of Gαi in the presence of Gαs. For AC VI, Gαs is required for inhibition but not binding by Gαi. For AC V, binding of two molecules of Gαs and Gαi to an AC dimer are required to fully describe the data.

Chu Y.T. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35450-35457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although native and recombinant Gαs have similar effects on the cytoplasmic domains of AC, activation of full-length AC is less effectively inhibited by Gαi upon stimulation of native versus recombinant Gαs (12Kleuss C. Krause E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Kleuss and Krause speculate that the palmitate on native Gαs competes with the myristate on Gαi for a hydrophobic binding pocket on AC (12Kleuss C. Krause E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Previous studies by Taussig et al. (13Taussig R. Tang W-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that both Gαs and Gαi are bound simultaneously to the enzyme, seemingly in contradiction to studies using the independently expressed cytoplasmic domains (3Dessauer C.W. Chen-Goodspeed M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28823-28829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In an attempt to fully understand the regulation of full-length human AC V and VI, we have modeled the kinetics of Gαs/Gαi regulation. Types V and VI AC are generally grouped together as being highly related AC isoforms. They are both activated by Gαs and forskolin and are inhibited by Gαi, free calcium, and RGS2 (14Gilman A.G.

AC V is activated by protein kinase C (PKC) α and ξ (21Kawabe J. Iwami G. Ebina T. Ohno S. Katada T. Ueda Y. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16554-16558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas AC VI is inhibited by PKC δ and ϵ (22Lin T.H. Lai H.L. Kao Y.Y. Sun C.N. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277Google Scholar). These enzymes are also different in how they respond to regulation by Gαs and Gαi. We show herein that the basal activity of human AC V, but not that of AC VI, is inhibited by Gαi. Both enzymes show greater inhibition by Gαi at low Gαs concentrations; however, Gαi activates human AC V at high Gαs concentrations. Mutations within the Gαs binding pocket of AC V and VI also reveal differences in the regulatory pattern of these enzymes. Models will be presented that highlight these differences and describe the kinetics of these two important regulators. Plasmid Construction and Generation of Recombinant Baculovirus—A 4.1-kb fragment containing the entire coding sequence of human type VI AC was transferred from hAC6-pCDNA to the baculovirus expression vector pfastbacdual using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and NotI. Human AC V was constructed by ligation of a 3.8-kb HindIII fragment from hAC5-pCDNA to HindIII-digested pfastbacdual. The human adenylyl cyclase type VI mutant, F1078S, was constructed using the PCR overlap extension method (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Primers flanking each side of the desired mutation were used starting at position 2687 of the coding strand (2687C) and 3552 of the reverse strand (3552R). The nucleotide sequences of the mutagenic primers (F1078S-R and F1078S-F) were selected by replacement of the wild type phenylalanine codon with the codon for serine. The 2687C/F1078SR and 3552R/F1078SF fragments were generated with a standard PCR mixture using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The fragments were purified from a 1% agarose gel and used in a second PCR to make the complete 2687C/3552R mutant fragment. The fragment was cloned into pfastbacdual-hACVI using restriction enzymes SalI and BstEII. The human AC V mutants, N1090D and V476A, were created using the same method and were cloned into pfastbacdual-hACV using the restriction enzymes AgeI and EcoNI (for N1090D) and BamHI and AatII (for V476A). The desired clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Generation of recombinant baculoviruses was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). A baculovirus containing the pfastbacdual vector alone was also generated for background subtraction of activities. Membrane Preparation—Sf9 cell membranes containing desired adenylyl cyclase isoforms and mutants have been prepared according to procedures described previously (24Taussig R. Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Purification and Activation of G Protein Subunits—Gαs was expressed and purified from the E. coli strain, BL21(DE3), as described by Lee et al. (25Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Myristoylated Gαi1 protein was produced by coexpression of Gαi with yeast protein N-myristoyltransferase as described previously (25Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 26Linder M.E. Pang I-H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4654-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified α-subunits were activated by incubation with 50 mm NaHEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 300 μm [35S]GTPγS at 30 °C for 30 min for Gαs or 1.75 h for Gαi. Gel filtration was used to remove free GTPγS, and the concentration of activated G protein subunits was determined by quantifying [35S]GTPγS binding. All G proteins were used in their activated state. Adenylyl Cyclase Assays—Activity of adenylyl cyclase was determined as described (27Dessauer C.W. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All assays were performed for 8–11 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 50 μl. The final concentration of MgCl2 and Mg-ATP in the assay mixture was 5 mm and 250 μm. Membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases were incubated with G protein subunits for 20 min on ice prior to initiation of the reaction. Under these conditions, protein activity remained linear for greater than 15 min at 30 °C over a large range of membrane concentrations. To determine the Km for substrate, the concentration of Mg-ATP was varied from 10 to 320 μm. The consumption of ATP was less than 10% of the total. All determinations were performed in duplicate or triplicate, and experiments shown were repeated at least twice. The endogenous Sf9 AC activity was subtracted from all measurements of basal activity and for Gαs activation curves for AC VI. The activity of vector-alone-infected Sf9 cell membranes represented between 10 and 30% of the total activity under all conditions for AC VI and 3–15% for AC V; the highest contribution from endogenous activity occurring under basal conditions. Overall analysis of activity remained essentially the same with or without background subtraction. Steady-state Kinetic Model—The rate equations for the reaction schemes presented in Fig. 6 were derived using steady-state assumptions for rapid equilibrium binding of G protein subunits. Since the Km for Mg-ATP did not significantly change upon binding Gαs or Gαi, and all experiments were performed at saturating Mg-ATP concentrations, the concentration of substrate was excluded as a variable. AC VI data were fit to the model presented in Fig. 6 using the equation V = (v1*A + v2*A*I/K3 + v3*K2 + v4*I*K2/K1)/(A + K2 + A*I/K3 + I*K2/K1), where K1–K4 are defined in Fig. 6A, and V represents the activity of AC VI at A and I, the molar concentration of the activator Gαs and the inhibitor Gαi, respectively. The velocities of the individual enzyme regulator complexes are given as v1–v4, where v1 represents the AC-Gs complex; v2 is the AC-Gs-Gi complex; v3 is basal AC; and v4 is the AC-Gi complex. Curve fitting and modeling of kinetic data were performed using Sigma Plot software (Jandel Scientific). Pooled data were normalized to the activity at 1 μm Gαs in the absence of Gαi to correct for small experiment-to-experiment variations. Endogenous Sf9 activity was subtracted at all concentrations of basal and Gαs-stimulated activity. The quality of the fit of experimental data to any given model was determined based upon the p values of fitted constants, the residual mean squares value of the fit, and a visual inspection of the predicted values compared with experimental data. AC V data were fit to the model presented in Fig. 7 using the equation V = v1*A + v2*I*A/K3 + v3*K2 + v4*I*K2/K1 + v5*A2/K4 + v6*A2*I/(K4*K5) + v7*A2*I2/(K4*K5*K6)/(A + A2/K4 + K2 + I*A/K3 + I*K2/(K1) + A2*I/(K4*K5) + A2*I2/(K4*K5*K6)), where V represents the activity of AC V at A and I, the molar concentration of the activator Gαs and the inhibitor Gαi, respectively. The velocities of the individual enzyme-regulator complexes are given as v1 (AC-Gs), v2 (AC-Gs-Gi), v3 (basal AC), v4 (AC-Gi), v5 (AC-Gs2), v6 (AC-Gs2-Gi), and v7 (AC-Gs2-Gi2). Endogenous Sf9 activity was subtracted at all Gαi concentrations of basal activity. Gαs Activation of AC—Gαs strongly activates all isoforms of mammalian membrane-bound ACs. Human AC V and AC VI were stimulated 250-fold and almost 500-fold by Gαs, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). The difference in the -fold activation lies in the low basal activity of AC VI (28Pieroni J.P. Harry A. Chen J. Jacobowitz O. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21368-21373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Crystallographic and binding studies using the cytoplasmic domains of AC indicated a single Gαs molecule bound per molecule of AC (29Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). However, careful Gαs dose-response curves suggested that for some isoforms (AC II, canine AC V, and rat AC VI) Gαs activation fit a Michaelis-Menten noninteracting two-site model (AC II) or a two-component interactive model, as in the case of AC VI (30Harry A. Chen Y. Magnusson R. Iyengar R. Weng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Scholich K. Wittpoth C. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9602-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although canine AC VI displayed biphasic activation, similar to the activation curve previously reported for rat AC VI (30Harry A. Chen Y. Magnusson R. Iyengar R. Weng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), human AC VI exhibited a nearly monophasic binding curve. A slight positive cooperativity observed at low Gαs concentrations gave rise to a Hill coefficient of 1.09 ± 0.05 (Fig. 1A). Human AC V also differed from what was previously demonstrated with canine AC V (31Scholich K. Wittpoth C. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9602-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Human AC V displayed clear cooperative activation by Gαs with a Hill coefficient of ∼1.4, significantly different from the two component shaped curves for canine AC V at low Gαs concentrations (30Harry A. Chen Y. Magnusson R. Iyengar R. Weng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Scholich K. Wittpoth C. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9602-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Gαi Inhibition of Basal Activity—AC V and VI are often characterized by their inhibition by Gαi. However, the basal activity of human AC VI was not inhibited by Gαi, unlike that of AC V (Fig. 1, C and D). This difference between AC V and VI has been largely unappreciated and may be due in part to the lower basal activity of AC VI as compared with AC V (28Pieroni J.P. Harry A. Chen J. Jacobowitz O. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21368-21373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). AC VI may already be held in an “inhibited” state such that Gαi has little further effect. Inhibition of Gαs-stimulated Activity—Gαi is able to effectively inhibit low levels of Gαs-stimulated AC V and VI. Inhibition of AC VI by Gαi decreases as Gαs stimulation increases, from a robust 82% inhibition of activity at 10–50 nm Gαs (representing 1.8–18% of full activity by Gαs) to a modest 25% inhibition upon full activation by Gαs (Fig. 2, A and B). This has been previously observed with the canine AC V enzyme (13Taussig R. Tang W-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low concentrations of Gαs giving rise to the greatest inhibition by Gαi, are also those concentrations that show the most positive cooperativity and deviation from Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Human AC V showed a similar trend as AC VI with respect to Gαi inhibition but with a surprising twist. Low concentrations of Gαs supported a strong 70% inhibition by Gαi, whereas higher concentrations of Gαs led to activation by Gαi (Fig. 2, C and D). This result has been repeated with numerous batches of Gαi and Gαs and observed in two different preparations of human AC V membranes. The activation of AC at high Gαi concentrations had previously been observed with type I AC upon stimulation with forskolin or calmodulin but not Gαs (13Taussig R. Tang W-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Canine AC VI showed a reversal of inhibition at high Gαi in the presence of forskolin, whereas Gαi activated canine AC V in the presence of forskolin and manganese (3Dessauer C.W. Chen-Goodspeed M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28823-28829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Taussig R. Tang W-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taussig et al. (13Taussig R. Tang W-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that at high concentrations, Gαi could bind the Gαs activation site of AC. This very plausible hypothesis has been well accepted in the field; however, it does not explain why Gαi would activate AC V in the presence of high concentrations of Gαs, which should already occupy the Gαs binding site. Determination of the Km for Mg-ATP—To determine the effect of Gαs or Gαi on substrate binding, we measured the Km for Mg-ATP across a wide range of Gαs and/or Gαi concentrations. The Km was altered less than 2.5-fold by the presence of Gαs and/or Gαi for AC V or VI (Tables I and II). Since Gαs and Gαi only show effects on the Vmax for AC, we were able to eliminate the binding of substrate as a variable in equations describing models of Gαs and Gαi regulation.Table IKinetic constants of Gαs - and Gαi-regulated activities of type VI ACEnzymeGαsGαiKm(ATP)Vmaxμmμmμmnmol / min / mgWild-type AC VI0.00.021 ± 10.010 ± 0.0070.00.0214 ± 30.011 ± 0.00060.00.219 ± 90.010 ± 0.0010.020.016 ± 0.70.75 ± 0.0080.020.0514 ± 0.70.20 ± 0.0020.021.012 ± 0.50.11 ± 0.0010.20.023 ± 11.68 ± 0.030.20.0529 ± 40.84 ± 0.030.21.012 ± 0.80.54 ± 0.0091.00.023 ± 11.81 ± 0.021.00.0532 ± 41.50 ± 0.071.01.016 ± 10.93 ± 0.02AC VI -F1078S0.00.048 ± 70.089 ± 0.0040.01.084 ± 10.073 ± 0.0051.00.041 ± 20.68 ± 0.011.01.085 ± 20.73 ± 0.008 Open table in a new tab Table IIKinetic constants of Gαs-and Gαi-regulated activities of type V ACEnzymeGαsGαiKm(ATP)Vmaxμmμmμmnmol/min/mgWild-type AC V0.00.011 ± 0.80.077 ± 0.0020.00.0214 ± 20.077 ± 0.0030.00.217 ± 10.066 ± 0.0010.01.029 ± 60.044 ± 0.0020.020.022 ± 17.4 ± 0.080.020.0518 ± 14.7 ± 0.060.021.014 ± 11.9 ± 0.040.20.022 ± 111.5 ± 0.10.20.0521 ± 18.2 ± 0.10.21.029 ± 18.0 ± 0.08AC V-N1090D0.00.026 ± 10.39 ± 0.0060.01.027 ± 60.11 ± 0.0071.00.016 ± 0.78.4 ± 0.091.01.036 ± 12.7 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Mutations within the Gαs Binding Pocket—The inability of Gαi to inhibit the basal, nonstimulated activity of AC VI suggests that the binding of Gαs must induce a conformation necessary for inhibition. The unusual activation of AC V by Gαi at high Gαs concentrations also pointed to interesting Gαi/Gαs regulation. To explore the role of Gαs binding further, we made mutations that directly participate in Gαs binding for AC VI and AC V. In AC VI, phenylalanine 1078, located at the junction of α helix 3 and β strand 4 in C2, was mutated to serine (29Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). A different mutation was chosen for AC V, predicted to have a less drastic effect on Gαs binding, in order to probe Gαs/Gαi regulation at high Gαs concentrations. Asparagine 1090, which is located in the loop between the α1 and α2 helices in C2, was mutated to aspartate in AC V (29Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that mutation of these residues greatly reduced Gαs affinity but had little effect on the overall Vmax or activation by forskolin when mutated in canine type V AC or in type II AC (7Yan S-Z. Huang Z.-H. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 18849-18854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6968-6975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mutation of Phe1078 in human AC VI to serine showed similar levels of overall activity when stimulated maximally with forskolin and Gαs (Fig. 3A), with only a 2–4-fold increase in Km for Mg-ATP (Table I). N1090D-AC V showed a reduction in overall activity (Fig. 3D) but no change in the Km for Mg-ATP (Table II). As predicted, F1078S-AC VI and N1090D-AC V had greatly reduced Gαs activity as compared with wild type (Fig. 3, A and D), displaying a 14- and 6-fold decrease, respectively, in the EC50 for Gαs activity (Fig. 3, B and E). Gαi Inhibition of AC VI-F1078S—Gαi did not inhibit the basal activity of the mutant F1078S, similar to wild-type AC VI (Fig. 3C). Gαi also failed to significantly inhibit Gαs-stimulated activity of the mutant F1078S (Fig. 4, A and B). This might have been expected for extremely low levels of Gαs, where activation was not greatly above basal activity. However, stimulation with 1 and 3 μm Gαs produced activity that was 8- and 13-fold above basal activity and represented an estimated 30–40% of total activity. For the wild-type enzyme, this level of activation displayed the greatest inhibition by Gαi (75–80%), whereas the mutant F1078S displayed a maximum of 20–25% inhibition by Gαi at the highest concentrations of Gαs tested and only 10–15% inhibition at lower concentrations of Gαi. The lack of Gαi inhibition was not due to an inability of the mutant enzyme to bind or respond to Gαi. Upon stimulation with forskolin, the mutant was inhibited to an even greater degree than the wild-type enzyme, despite having a 3-fold lower EC50 for forskolin and increased activity (Fig. 5, A and B). Unlike for Gαs stimulation, inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC VI did not appear to be dependent on the degree of activation. Activation by low and moderate concentrations of forskolin produced nearly identical Gαi inhibition curves. Gαi Inhibition of AC V-N1090D—The mutation of the Gαs binding pocket in AC V showed a strikingly different regulation by Gαi than what was observed for AC VI. The inhibition of basal activity by Gαi was not perturbed by mutations within the Gαs site, but inhibition of Gαs stimulation was significantly altered from that of wild-type AC V. All concentrations of Gαs displayed the same potent ∼70% inhibition by Gαi, and no significant increase in activity was observed at high Gαi concentrations. Although Gαi inhibition of Gαs stimulation was altered, inhibition of forskolin-stimulated activity was similar to wild type. AC V-N1090D had a nearly identical EC50 for forskolin activation and showed strong inhibition by Gαi. Modeling of Gαs and Gαi Regulation of AC VI—Our model for AC VI is shown in Fig. 6A. Both Gαi and Gαs bind individually to the basal state of the enzyme; however, only Gαs will alter the enzymatic activity of basal AC VI. Binding of Gαi to the basal enzyme has little effect on basal activity but reduces the activity of the AC VI-Gαs complex. The experimental data shown in Figs. 1 and 2 were fit to the equation describing this model (Fig. 6, B–D) and makes several predictions about the interactions of Gαs and Gαi. First, the binding of Gαi reduces the affinity of AC VI for Gαs by 3.6-fold, and vice versa. We showed previously that the binding of Gαs to the cytoplasmic domains of AC V decreased binding by Gαi. Gαi inhibited the activity of the cytoplasmic domains by reducing the interactions between the two domains, in opposition to the mechanism of activation by Gαs. The opposing mechanism of these two regulators supports a decrease in Kd for one regulator in the presence of the second. Note that in this model, Gαs and Gαi simultaneously bind to AC, despite the fact that biochemical data showed that a complex of C1-C2-Gαi-Gαs cannot be formed (3Dessauer C.W. Chen-Goodspeed M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28823-28829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The independently expressed C1 and C2 domains are not physically linked together via membrane spans, and the reduction in domain affinity upon Gαi binding most likely disrupts the nonlinked complex. Second, this model requires Gαs for inhibition, but not binding, by Gαi. This prediction is supported by the F1078S mutation of the Gαs binding site, which not only reduces the affinity of Gαs but also largely prevents the conformational change necessary for Gαi inhibition. In addition, Gαi binds to the isolated C1 domain of AC VI (data not shown), suggesting that it could also bind the full-length enzyme. Finally, we were unable to fit our experimental data to models that do not allow for Gαi binding to the basal state of AC VI. If Gαi is not allowed to bind to AC VI alone, maximum inhibition occurs at high, not low, levels of Gαs. This is due to the fact that our model predicts only a ∼20% inhibition of the AC VI-Gαs complex by Gαi; the high degree of inhibition by Gαi at low concentrations of Gαs is obtained from the formation of the AC VI-Gαi complex in the wake of reduced Gαs affinity (Fig. 6). Modeling of Human AC V—In formulating our model for AC VI, we chose to ignore the small deviation from Michaelis-Menten kinetics for Gαs activation of AC VI. This was largely due to the high quality of the fits to experimental data using the model as presented. Other models tested did not significantly aid our data analysis. Thus, if synergistic Gαs activation is indicative of multimerization of AC as some evidence suggests (30Harry A. Chen Y. Magnusson R. Iyengar R. Weng G. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it does not significantly alter the kinetics of Gαi regulation for AC VI. However, for AC V, we simply could not ignore the cooperative activation by Gαs. In light of the crystal structure and a significant amount of biochemical data, we find it unlikely that two Gαs sites are present on a single AC monomer (6Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E.

Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). If true, mutagenesis of one site should leave a second site intact. However, mutations within the “known” Gαs-binding site do not support this conclusion, particularly mutations made within a soluble C1-C2 construct that show the same phenotype as those made within the membrane-bound AC. More likely, AC V (and possibly AC VI) is capable of forming dimers or multimers. Complementation of mutant AC I molecules, non-Michaelis-Menten Gαs activation curves, and more recently clever FRET-based strategies using AC 8 have pointed to the existence of AC dimers/multimers (30Harry A. Chen Y. Magnusson R. Iyengar R. Weng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19017-19021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Gu C. Cali J.J. Cooper D.M. Eur. J.

Thus, in our model, we assumed that AC V represented at least a dimer and that two Gαs molecules could simultaneously bind this dimeric/multimeric AC V, giving rise to an ACx-Gs2 complex. However, models that did not allow for Gαi binding to ACx-Gs2, accurately predicted Gαs cooperative activation but failed to predict the inhibition, followed by activation by Gαi at moderate Gαs concentrations. The same was true for models that did not allow for Gαi binding to ACx-Gs2-Gi. The only model with the least number of parameters that accurately fit the data presented is shown in Fig. 7A. The main features of this model are the requirement for multiple Gαs/Gαi sites and an enhanced activity of ACx-Gs2-Gi and ACx-Gs2-Gi2 as compared with ACx-Gs2. Mutation of the Gαs site in AC V does not show any significant increase in activity at high Gαi concentrations and no cooperative activation by Gαs (Hill coefficient = 1.0). We may simply have failed to use sufficiently high concentrations of Gαs to observe any increase in activity by Gαi. Alternatively, if dimers of AC do exist, mutating the Gαs site may have resulted in the loss of any cooperative activation between two AC molecules. The data for AC V-N1090D can be easily fit to the equation described for AC VI, albeit with different parameters, where the binding of Gαi is no longer altered by Gαs binding. To examine whether Gαi stimulation of AC V at high Gαs concentrations is due to interactions with the Gαi versus Gαs site, we made a mutation within the Gαi binding cleft (V476A) that was previously shown to increase the IC50 for Gαi inhibition by >30-fold in canine AC V (M476A). Mutation of the Gαi binding site in AC V resulted in a greater than 20-fold shift in the IC50 for Gαi inhibition, as predicted (Fig. 8). At high Gαs concentrations, a small 20% increase in activity still occurs, but only at the highest concentration of Gαi tested (3 μm). Thus, mutation of the Gαi binding site alters both inhibition and activation of AC V by Gαi, suggesting that Gαi may be binding to the same site under both conditions. Mutation of the Gαi binding site had no effect on the EC50 for Gαs activation. Conclusion—It is unclear what might contribute to the regulatory differences between species of AC V and the human isoforms of AC V and AC VI, which include cooperative Gαs activation of AC V; inhibition of basal activity by Gαi of AC V but not AC VI; and the stimulation of AC V activity by Gαi at high Gαs concentrations. Few differences exist within the cytoplasmic domains of AC, which make up the catalytic core. For example, in comparisons between human AC V and VI, there are only 15 and 16 amino acid changes in the C1a and C2 domains, respectively, and only eight of these in C1a and five in C2 represent nonconservative differences. In addition, there are absolutely no amino acid changes within the active site, C1-C2 interface, or Gαs- or Gαi-binding sites. Thus, it is unlikely that structural differences in the catalytic domains are responsible for these differences. Residues immediately preceding the Gαs binding site in α helix 3 of the C2 domain and residues within the variable C1b domain have a number of conservative and nonconservative changes between human AC V and VI. However, it is difficult to point to specific regions within the cytoplasmic domains that might give rise to the differences observed between AC isoforms or among species of ACVinGαs stimulation and the inhibition/stimulation by Gαi. The major difference between canine and human AC V and between human AC V and human AC VI lies in the N terminus. Human, rat, and rabbit AC V share similar N termini; however, canine share almost no homology in this region due to differential splicing (34Iwami G. Akanuma M. Kawabe J. Cannon P.J. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 110: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The N terminus of human AC V also shares almost no homology with that of AC VI. Deletion of the N terminus in AC VI does not alter the regulation by Gαs or forskolin or the sensitivity to P-site inhibitors (10Kao Y.Y. Lai H.L. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34440-34448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The N terminus of AC VI is the site of PKC inhibition of AC VI (22Lin T.H. Lai H.L. Kao Y.Y. Sun C.N. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277Google Scholar, 35Lai H.L. Lin T.H. Kao Y.Y. Lin W.J. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the N terminus modulates Gαi-mediated inhibition of AC VI via binding to the C1a domain (10Kao Y.Y. Lai H.L. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34440-34448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is possible that the N terminus of AC V also plays a role in the regulation of activity and thus may provide the key to species differences for AC V and the differences in regulation of basal and Gαs-stimulated activities for human AC V and VI. The other major difference between isoforms lies in the membrane-spanning regions. For AC 8, the membrane spans were the major determinant for interactions between AC molecules (32Gu C. Cali J.J. Cooper D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and thus may give rise to the cooperative activation by Gαs. Thus, the N terminus and membrane-spanning regions may provide the fine tuned regulatory differences observed between AC isoforms. In conclusion, we have described models for Gαs and Gαi regulation of human AC V and AC VI. Our studies have highlighted the differences between the mechanisms of activation and inhibition for these closely related AC isoforms and provide additional evidence for the need for higher order complexes of AC to fully explain the complexity of AC activation and inhibition. We thank Dr. Jim Tomlinson at COR Therapeutics for the human AC V and AC VI clones, Dr. Roger Barber for help with data analysis and thoughtful discussions, and Dr. Jun Chen for help with early studies using canine AC V and VI."
https://openalex.org/W2016601854,"RhoB is a small GTP-binding protein that is involved in apoptotic signal transduction. We have cloned the mouse RhoB mRNA including a 1377 nucleotide 3'-untranslated region (UTR) that contains six AU-rich elements (AREs) as well as several uridine-rich stretches. There is 94% homology overall between the mouse and rat RhoB genes and 92% homology between the mouse and a putative human clone. Ultraviolet light (UVL) induces RhoB production through regulated changes in gene transcription and mRNA stabilization although the latter mechanism is unknown. We observed that UVL increased the half-life of RhoB mRNA from 63 min to 3.3 h in NIH/3T3 cells and from 87 min to 2.7 h in normal human keratinocyte cells. In vitro mobility shift assays demonstrated that HuR bound the 3'-UTR of RhoB at three distinct locations (nucleotides 1342-1696, 1765-1920 and 1897-1977) suggesting a regulatory role for this RNA-binding protein. HuR immunoprecipitations were positive for RhoB mRNA indicating an in vivo association, and Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence demonstrated that HuR rapidly partitions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm after UVL. Therefore, we propose a model in which UVL induces stress-activated signal transduction leading to nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of HuR and subsequent stabilization of RhoB mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2072757169,"Thrombosis can lead to life-threatening conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. Although commonly used anti-coagulant drugs, such as low molecular weight heparin and warfarin, are effective, they carry a significant risk of inducing severe bleeding complications, and there is a need for safer drugs. Activated Factor XI (FXIa) is a key enzyme in the amplification phase of the coagulation cascade. Anti-human FXI antibody significantly reduces thrombus growth in a baboon thrombosis model without bleeding problems (Gruber, A., and Hanson, S. R. (2003) Blood 102, 953-955). Therefore, FXIa is a potential target for anti-thrombosis therapy. To determine the structure of FXIa, we derived a recombinant catalytic domain of FXI, consisting of residues 370-607 (rhFXI370-607). Here we report the first crystal structure of rhFXI370-607 in complex with a substitution mutant of ecotin, a panserine protease protein inhibitor secreted by Escherichia coli, to 2.2 Å resolution. The presence of ecotin not only assisted in the crystallization of the enzyme but also revealed unique structural features in the active site of FXIa. Subsequently, the sequence from P5 to P2′ in ecotin was mutated to the FXIa substrate sequence, and the structures of the rhFXI370-607-ecotin mutant complexes were determined. These structures provide us with an understanding of substrate binding interactions of FXIa, the structural information essential for the structure-based design of FXIa-selective inhibitors.

Thrombosis can be divided into an initiation phase and an amplification phase (1Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The initiation phase is triggered by vascular injury, which leads to exposure of tissue factor. Tissue factor and activated Factor VII (FVIIa) 1The abbreviations used are: FVIIa, activated coagulation factor VII; FXIa, activated coagulation factor XI; FXI, coagulation factor XI; rhFXI370-607, recombinant human FXI catalytic domain containing residues 370-607; FIX, coagulation factor IX; FX, coagulation factor X; FXII, coagulation factor XII. together activate Factor X to FXa, which in turn activates prothrombin to thrombin. This process is normally rapidly shut down by tissue factor pathway inhibitor and anti-thrombin III. Trace amounts of thrombin initiate the amplification phase of thrombosis and can convert platelet-bound FXI to FXIa, which, in turn, promotes Factor IX (FIX) activation on the platelet surface, resulting in local, explosive generation of thrombin and the formation of hemostatic thrombi at sites of vascular injury (see Ref. 2Walsh P.N. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar for review). Thus, FXI plays an essential role as an amplifier in the blood coagulation process. Although FXI can be converted to FXIa by thrombin (3Bouma B.N. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6432-6437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or FXIa itself (4Gailani D. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1991; 253: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 5Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in vitro, activation by thrombin predominates over other activators such as activated Factor XII (FXIIa) or FXIa on the activated platelet surface (6Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20514-20519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, individuals with FXI deficiency have abnormal hemostasis, whereas deficiencies in FXII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen are not associated with hemostatic abnormalities (7Leiba H. Ramot B. Many A. Br. J. Haematol. 1965; 11: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Ragni M.V. Sinha D. Seaman F. Lewis J.H. Spero J.A. Walsh P.N. Blood. 1985; 65: 719-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, thrombin, rather than FXIIa, is the likely activator of FXI under normal physiological conditions. Malfunctions of the blood coagulation cascade can lead to life-threatening conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and stroke resulting from arterial or venous thrombosis. Commonly used anti-coagulant drugs include unfractionated heparins, low molecular weight heparins, and warfarin. Although these drugs are efficacious, they have serious limitations. They target multiple coagulation factors, carry a significant risk of inducing severe bleeding complications, and have narrow therapeutic windows for safe administration, requiring routine monitoring. To decrease bleeding liabilities, new anti-coagulants have been designed to target specific steps in the coagulation pathway, such as thrombin and FXa; however, their safety profile has yet to be established in clinical trials (9Hirsh, J., O'Donnell, M., and Weitz, J. I. (2004) Blood 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4195Google Scholar). Because FXIa is a key enzyme involved in the amplification phase of the pathway, modulating FXIa activity should not affect the initiation phase but should reduce thrombus formation without compromising hemostasis and thus have few or no bleeding liabilities. Supporting evidence comes from the report that an anti-human FXI antibody did not prevent thrombus initiation, but significantly reduced intraluminal thrombus growth in a baboon thrombosis model (10Gruber A. Hanson S.R. Blood. 2003; 102: 953-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The anti-FXI antibody prolonged the partial thromboplastin time (a measure of the coagulation function involving FXIa) but did not affect prothrombin time (a measure of the coagulation function involving FVIIa and tissue factor). Most significantly, the anti-FXI antibody did not prolong bleeding time. In addition, individuals with FXI deficiency do not show severe bleeding problems (8Ragni M.V. Sinha D. Seaman F. Lewis J.H. Spero J.A. Walsh P.N. Blood. 1985; 65: 719-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, FXIa has been implicated in maintaining clot integrity (1Bouma B.N. Meijers J.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Minnema M.C. Friederich P.W. von dem Levi M. Borne P.A. Mosnier L.O. Meijers J.C. Biemond B.J. Hack C.E. ten Bouma B.N. Cate H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, FXIa appears to be an attractive target for developing novel anti-coagulant agents that might be advantageous over existing inhibitors for prophylaxis and treatment of thrombotic disorders. FXI is a 160-kDa protein composed of two identical 80-kDa subunits that are linked by a disulfide bond and is activated by cleavage after residue 369 of each of the two subunits, producing a protein that contains two heavy and two light chains. Each heavy chain contains four tandem repeat sequences, designated “apple” domains, containing binding sites for platelets (12Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6734-6740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), heparin (13Ho D.H. Badellino K. Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16382-16390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and many proteins such as thrombin (14Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 45470-45476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Each light chain, consisting of residues 370-607, contains a catalytic domain. The catalytic domain of FXIa is a trypsin-like serine protease, highly homologous to the catalytic domains of other factors in the blood coagulation cascade, such as FIXa, FXa, FVIIa, and thrombin. To develop FXIa-selective inhibitors using structure-based ligand design, it is essential to obtain the three-dimensional structure of FXIa and to identify unique features of the FXIa catalytic domain. To obtain the first structure of the catalytic domain of FXIa (rhFXI370-607), we formed a complex between rhFXI370-607 and ecotin. Ecotin is a 142-amino acid pan-serine protease inhibitor found in the periplasm of Escherichia coli (18Chung C.H. Ives H.E. Almeda S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11032-11038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein exists as a dimer and inhibits a broad range of serine proteases. The ecotin dimer interacts with two serine protease molecules to form a tetrameric complex. Several crystal structures of serine proteases in complex with ecotin have been reported (19McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Perona J.J. Tsu C.A. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J.

Hur E. Sousa C.A. Brinen L. Slivka E.J. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7959-7966Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The unique arrangement of the interactions in the serine protease-ecotin tetramer and the adaptability of the ecotin dimer suggested that ecotin could assist in the crystallization of many serine proteases, including rhFXI370-607. Here we report three rhFXI370-607-ecotin structures. The first is the rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R structure, in which the P1 residue of ecotin has been mutated from methionine to arginine. The second is rhFXI370-607-ecotinD, in which the ecotin residues P5 through P2′ have been replaced with residues from the FXIa substrate FIX (80NDFTRVV86). The last is rhFXI370-607-ecotinP, in which ecotin residues P4 to P2′ were mutated to the substrate sequence of FXIa (81DFTRVV86), which helped to explain structural differences between rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R and rhFXI370-607-ecotinD. All together, these structures not only reveal three-dimensional structural information for FXIa, but also demonstrate the possible interaction of the enzyme with its substrate. Preparation of Recombinant FXI Catalytic Domain—The recombinant FXI catalytic domain, amino acid residues 370-607, was expressed as a secreted protein in the methanolotropic yeast Pichia pastoris. A detailed report on cloning and expression will be presented elsewhere. 2P. Pandey, K. J. Seidl, F. Bibbins, J. E. Strickler, and D. T. Weaver, manuscript in preparation. The enzyme was initially separated from conditioned medium using ammonium sulfate precipitation (50-80% saturation). The ammonium sulfate precipitate was dialyzed against two changes (100 volumes each) of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The dialyzed enzyme was then purified by a combination of immobilized Zn+2-chelate chromatography (Zn-IMAC, Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow, Amersham Biosciences) and cation exchange chromatography (SP-Sepharose Fast Flow, Amersham Bioscience). To remove high mannose-type oligosaccharide side chains, the enzyme was treated with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) at a concentration of 500 units/mg rhFXI370-607 for 90 min prior to the ion exchange step. The purity of the protein was estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis on 8-16% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and by RP-HPLC analysis (data not shown). Protein concentrations were also estimated by RP-HPLC using a calibration curve constructed with commercially purchased, native FXIa (Hematologic Technologies, Inc., Essex Junction, VT). The protein was reduced by treatment with 10 mm dithiothreitol to allow separation of the heavy and light chains during chromatography, and only the peak derived from the light chain was used for calibration purposes. Enzymatic activity was measured using a peptide substrate pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-7-methylamidocoumarin. This is a modification of the standard peptide substrate S2366 in which the chromogenic moiety p-nitroaniline was replaced with the fluorogenic reporter, 7-methylcoumarin. Preparation of Ecotin Mutants—Expression plasmids of wild-type ecotin and the ecotinM84R (80PVSTRMA86, native sequence 80PVSTMMA86) were the kind gift of Dr. Robert J. Fletterick and have been described before (24McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Browner M.F. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ecotin substitutions containing the FIX cleavage site, ecotinD (80NDFTRVV86) and ecotinP (80PDFTRVV86), were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The ecotinD construct was generated in two steps. In the first step, ecotinM84R was mutated to ecotinNDF (80NDFTRMA86), and in the second step ecotinNDF was used as a template to generate ecotinD. EcotinP was generated using ecotinD as a template. The methods for the expression and purification of ecotin mutants were similar to those described previously (24McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Browner M.F. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Minor modifications included transformation of the ecotin plasmids into the E. coli strain BL21 and further purification of the ecotin mutants using a POROS HQ (Applied Biosystems) column (4.6 × 50 mm) mounted on a BioCAD 700E in buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Purified ecotin was collected in the unbound fraction. Formation of rhFXI370-607-Ecotin Complexes—A complex of rhFXI370-607 and each ecotin mutant was formed by incubating stoichiometric quantities of each component at 4 °C overnight and subsequently isolating the complex on a Superose 12 column (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Bioscience) with buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, on a BioCAD 700E. The complexes were concentrated with a Centricon YM-10 concentrator (Amicon) to an absorbance of 30 at 280 nm with a 1-cm path length (∼9-10 mg rhFXI370-607/ml). Crystallization and Structure Determination of rhFXI370-607-Ecotin Mutant Complexes—The rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R complex was crystallized at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, from 0.2 m NaCl, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-1000, 0.1 m sodium potassium phosphate, pH 6.2. Diffraction data to 2.2 Å resolution were measured at beamline X12C of the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and processed by HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W.J. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group P212121 with unit cell parameters of a = 44.6 Å, b = 92.7 Å, and c = 186.9 Å. There are two rhFXI370-607 and two ecotinM84R molecules forming a tetramer in the asymmetric unit. The structure of rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R was determined by molecular replacement using the program Amore (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 57: 1367-1372Crossref Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The search model was created from the coordinates of the tetrameric rat granzyme B [N66Q]-ecotin 81IEPD84 complex with Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1FI8 (21Waugh S.M. Harris J.L. Fletterick R. Craik C.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The conserved core structure of serine proteases was identified first by structural alignment of several serine proteases. All side-chain atoms beyond Cβ, all surface loops in granzyme B, and all water molecules were deleted from the model. A clear solution was obtained using data of 20-5 Å resolution with a correlation coefficient of 52.4 and an R factor of 48.9.

Ecotin Facilitates the Crystallization of rhFXI370-607—Several crystal structures of serine protease-ecotin complexes, such as trypsin-ecotin, thrombin-ecotin, FXa-ecotin, collagenase-ecotin, and granzyme B-ecotin (19McGrath M.E.

There is a unique arrangement between the ecotin dimer and serine proteases that allows ecotin to facilitate the crystallization of the different serine proteases forming a complex with it. Because the catalytic domain of FXIa is a serine protease, we proposed that ecotin would be an inhibitor for FXIa and that ecotin would facilitate the crystallization of rhFXI370-607. Furthermore, ecotinM84R was designed to interact better with the aspartate residue that all trypsin-like serine proteases possess in the substrate binding site. The ability of each of the mutants to inhibit the peptidolytic activity of FXIa was assessed. The IC50 values for ecotinM84R, ecotinP, and ecotinD were 3, >200, and 600 nm, respectively. However, subsequent results suggest that ecotinP and ecotinD were acting as competitive substrates, see below. The rhFXI370-607 protein did not produce diffraction-quality crystals with small molecule inhibitors such as benzamidine but yielded diffraction-quality crystals in complex with the wild-type and all three mutated ecotin proteins. Thus, the use of ecotin allowed us to obtain a structure of our target enzyme. Tetrameric Complex of rhFXI370-607-EcotinM84R—There is a tetrameric complex in the asymmetric unit of rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R crystal. The quaternary structure of the rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R tetramer is similar to other serine protease-ecotin structures in that it is composed of one ecotinM84R dimer (chain C and D in the coordinate file) and two rhFXI370-607 molecules (chain A and chain B in the coordinate file), which form three distinct types of binding interfaces: the dimerization interface between the two ecotinM84R molecules, a primary substrate-like interaction and a smaller secondary interaction between the corresponding ecotinM84R and rhFXI370-607 molecule (Fig. 1A). The ecotin monomers have their primary and secondary FXIa binding sites located at the two ends of the molecules. The ecotin dimer collectively provides binding surfaces for two FXIa molecules. For each rhFXI370-607 molecule, there is a primary and a secondary ecotin binding site. The primary binding site involves ecotin residues 81-88 (the ecotin 80s loop) and 52-54 (the ecotin 50s loop) of one ecotin molecule, which extend into the active site of rhFXI370-607. The secondary binding site is about 25 Å away from the primary site; it includes two surface loops of the other ecotin molecule, ecotin residues 63-70 (the ecotin 60s loop) and 108-113 (the ecotin 110s loop), which bind to part of the C-terminal helix and residues 91-95 of rhFXI370-607. We adopted the trypsin numbering system for rhFXI370-607 for easy comparison with other members in this serine protease family. The corresponding residue numbers for the FXI sequence and trypsin numbering system are listed in the Supplemental Material (Table S1). The rhFXI370-607 Structure in the rhFXI370-607-EcotinM84R Complex—The overall structure of rhFXI370-607 is similar to other serine proteases of the chymotrypsin fold (Fig. 1B). The globular structure is formed by two β barrels with a few helical segments and many loops. The catalytic triad, composed of Ser195, His57, and Asp102 is located at the junction between the two β-barrel domains. A unique feature of rhFXI370-607 revealed in the rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R structure is that the side chain of Glu98 (Fig. 1B) points into the active site, where it does not appear to have a complementary polar environment. One of the oxygen atoms of the Glu98 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with its main-chain nitrogen atom, and the other oxygen atom is within hydrogen bonding distance to the carbonyl oxygen of ecotin Leu52. Because Glu98 interacts with ecotin Leu52, this orientation of Glu98 might be ecotin-induced. Another unique feature is the orientation of Tyr59A, located near the catalytic His57 (Fig. 1B), which points away from the protein and is in van der Waals contact with the ecotin 50s loop. Although it was not clear from this structure whether the position of Tyr59A in rhFXI370-607 is ecotin-induced, subsequent crystal structures have shown that this is a feature of rhFXI370-607 and is not induced by either ecotin or crystal packing. 3L. Jin, P. Pandey, R. E. Babine, D. T. Weaver, S. S. Abdel-Meguid, and J. E. Strickler, unpublished data. However, the side-chain position of Glu98 varies from structure to structure. The EcotinM84R Structure—The modified jellyroll fold of the ecotin monomer is preserved in the rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R structure. The extended C-terminal regions of the two ecotins form anti-parallel β-sheets and wrap around each other at the dimer interface of ecotin (Figs. 1A and 2). When the Cα atoms of an ecotinM84R monomer (chain C, residues 9-60, 71-75, and 105-134) are compared with other ecotin monomers derived from the structure of the ecotin dimer (PDB code: 1ECZ), the trypsin-ecotin complex (1EZS), the collagenase-ecotin complex (1AZZ), the granzyme B-ecotin complex (1FI8), the thrombin-ecotin complex (1ID5), and the FXa-ecotin complex (1P0S), the root mean square deviation is between 0.53 and 1.19 Å. The ecotin monomer in the rhFXI370-607-ecotin M84R complex is most similar to that in the thrombin-ecotin structure and most divergent from the granzyme B-ecotin structure. As illustrated in Fig. 2, most of the differences are located in ecotin residues 80-100 to accommodate the uniqueness of the active sites in different proteases. There is a slightly altered spatial orientation of the primary and secondary binding sites with respect to each other. When the Cα atoms of one ecotin monomer in the different ecotin dimers structures described above were superimposed, the relative positions of the second monomer diverged considerably (Fig. 2). The difference between ecotin dimers arises from small local shifts among different β sheets, accumulating to large distal positional changes. Similar observations were discussed in more detail by Perona et al. (20Perona J.J. Tsu C.A. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5381-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) for the collagenase-ecotin structure. This flexibility of the ecotin dimer is responsible for the ability of ecotin to inhibit a variety of serine proteases. The structural differences in the ecotin dimer are also reflected in the differences in the protease-ecotin tetrameric structures. In fact, molecular replacement searches did not produce a reasonable solution using either the tetrameric structures of trypsin-ecotin or collagenase-ecotin as search models against the diffraction data of rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R. The tetrameric structure of granzyme B-ecotin, however, yielded an unambiguous solution from the rotational and translational search of molecular replacement. Interactions between EcotinM84R and rhFXI370-607 at the Primary Binding Site—The primary binding site of ecotinM84R interacts extensively with the active site of rhFXI370-607 in a substrate-like manner (Fig. 3). Eight residues of the ecotin 80s loop, residues 81-88, on both sides of the scissile bond, are in direct contact with rhFXI370-607. The binding pockets of serine proteases are defined according to the residues of its substrate, thus the P1 residue of the substrate (located N-terminal to the scissile bond) occupies the S1 site of the protease, P1′ (located C-terminal to the scissile bond) resides in the S1′ site, and so on. Cys50 of ecotin forms a disulfide bond with ecotin Cys87 (P3′) to anchor the 80s loop, whereas many hydrogen bonds between the ecotin 50s and 80s loops provide additional support. The S1 binding pocket of rhFXI370-607 is the only deep pocket in rhFXI370-607 used for substrate binding (Fig. 3). Ecotin Arg84 fits into the S1 pocket of rhFXI370-607. In one pair of the rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R complexes, the guanidinium group of ecotin Arg84 (chain C) forms salt bridges with both oxygen atoms of Asp189 of rhFXI370-607 (chain A). The conformation of ecotin Arg84 and its interactions with rhFXI370-607, involving two water molecules, are very similar to the corresponding residues in the structures of trypsin-ecotin and thrombin-ecotin complexes. In the other pair of the rhFXI370-607-ecotinM84R complexes, the guanidinium group of ecotin Arg84 (chain D) forms only a single salt bridge with one of the oxygen atoms of Asp189 (chain B). Furthermore, there is only one water molecule mediating the interaction between ecotin Arg84 and the S1 pocket. In both pairs, the main chain oxygen of ecotin Arg84 is stabilized by the oxyanion hole of rhFXI370-607 formed by the main-chain nitrogen atoms of Gly193 and Ser195. The S2, S3, and S4 binding sites are less well defined (Fig. 3), although the S2 loop of rhFXI370-607 (residues 96-100, including Glu98) is in a unique conformation compared with other"
https://openalex.org/W1970277946,"Conventional cytogenetic analysis currently stratifies acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) into prognostically relevant groups. However, approximately 50% of adult AMLs have normal cytogenetics (NC-AMLs), and represent a heterogeneous and poorly understood group. We analysed gene expression in 55 AML samples including 53 cases from adult patients with NC-AML (n = 36), trisomy 8, t(15;17), t(8;21), t(11;19), 7q deletion, and two cell lines using 9000-gene DNA microarrays. Global hierarchical clustering showed that NC-AMLs are a heterogeneous group. Supervised analysis distinguished two subgroups of NC-AML: one subgroup constituted a homogeneous NC cluster ('pure NC-AML'), and the other NC-AMLs were close to the AML cases with translocations ('translocation like'). Gene expression signatures were also derived for patients with trisomy 8, as well as FLT3 and MLL gene duplications. Importantly, samples from 24 NC-AML patients who could be evaluated for clinical outcome were analysed. In all, 43 genes that discriminated two classes of patients with significantly different prognosis were identified. The poor prognosis class contained a majority of 'pure NC-AMLs', whereas the 'translocation-like' AMLs were in the good prognosis class. Discriminator genes included genes involved in drug resistance (TOP2B), protein transport (MTX2, SLC35A2), and cell signalling (MAPK1, PRKAB2). Our results demonstrate the transcriptional heterogeneity of NC-AMLs, and suggest the existence of 'translocation-like' NC-AMLs and of a gene expression signature that may predict response to chemotherapy."

Herein, we report identification of an autoantigen shared by various target organs in IQI/Jic mice. Polypeptides identified based on immunorecognition by autoantibodies in sera from IQI/Jic mice affected with autoimmune disease (>12 weeks of age) were tissue kallikrein (Klk)-1 and -13 and were cross-reactive to the autoantibodies. Interestingly, Klk-13, but not Klk-1, caused a proliferative response of splenic T cells from IQI/Jic mice from the age of 4 weeks onward. In addition, remarkably enhanced expression of Klk-13 was observed in the salivary glands of the mice in accordance with the development of inflammatory lesions. These results indicate that Klk-13 acts as an autoantigen and may increase T cells responsive to organs commonly expressing Klk-13, playing a pivotal role in the etiology of progression of disease in IQI/Jic mice.

Patients with SS often show a wide spectrum of autoimmune-related disorders, including pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, interstitial nephritis, and interstitial pneumonitis. In these target organs, different epithelial cells in exocrine and nonexocrine tissues are primarily affected, and SS has been generally referred to as “autoimmune exocrinopathy,” “dry gland syndrome,” or, more recently as “autoimmune epithelitis” (3Strand V.

However, the molecular nature of autoantigens causing the autoimmunity against the different epithelial cells in multiple organs in SS has remained obscure.

In this study, we first demonstrated the presence of IgG autoantibodies characteristic to IQI/Jic mice by immunoblotting and identified the targets of these autoantibodies as kallikrein (Klk)-1 and -13, which are known to be localized mainly in glandular tissues (26Olsson A.Y. Lundwall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Then we examined expression of and T cell proliferative responses to Klk-1 and -13 to investigate roles of these molecules in autoimmune pathogenesis in IQI/Jic mice. Animals—IQI/Jic mice were bred from breeding pairs purchased from Crea Japan (Tokyo, Japan) and maintained in our own animal facility. Female IQI/Jic mice of various ages were utilized for this study. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan) were used as sex- and age-matched controls. The animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. All of the experimental procedures met with the approval of Laboratory Animal Experimentation Committee, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University. Immunoblotting—Various tissues from 16-week-old IQI/Jic mice were homogenized with a Polytron mixer (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 30 min, the proteins in the supernatant were treated with 3% β-mercaptoethanol (Wako, Osaka, Japan) at 95 °C for 3 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filters were incubated with sera (diluted 1:100) from different strains, followed by the reaction with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) and visualization with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Salivary extracts of IQI/Jic mice of various ages and BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were also prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis with sera from IQI/Jic mice. Purification and Identification of the Salivary Antigens—Detergent-free extracts of the salivary glands from IQI/Jic mice at the ages of 16–32 weeks were separately prepared in 20 mm phosphate-NaOH (pH 5.0) and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), for the purification of 18- and 16-kDa antigens, respectively. Extracted proteins in phosphate-NaOH buffer were separated on a Q Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences) with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer. The extract in Tris-HCl buffer was similarly fractionated using an S Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) column and then a Q Sepharose FF column. Antigen-containing fractions from each sample were identified by immunoblotting with sera of IQI/Jic mice and were separately fractionated on a Superdex 75HR column (Amersham Biosciences). Antigen-containing fractions were subjected to further purifications by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using an RPC resource column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins in the positive fractions indicated by arrows in Fig. 1B were separated on SDS gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, bands corresponding to the antigens were excised and analyzed for their N-terminal sequences with the Procise 492 protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from various organs of 16-week-old IQI/Jic mice with an RNA extraction reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNA synthesis was performed using a reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's directions. The cDNA was amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-CCGCTTCACCAAATATCAATGTG-3′ and 5′-GCTCATCTGGGTATTCATATTTGACG-3′ for Klk-1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_010639); 5′-GTACTACCAAAAGGAACACATT-3′ and 5′-CAGGAGGTATTGTTTGAAGCA-3′ for Klk-13 (GenBank™ accession number NM_010115); and 5′-GAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATT-3′ and 5′-GAAGACACCAGTAGACTCCACGACATA-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GenBank™ accession number BC_083065). PCR was conducted with 35, 40, and 30 cycles for the amplification of Klk-1, Klk-13, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively, and each cycle included denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 66 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 2.0% agarose gels. All of the primers generated only one amplification band (see Fig. 2B). The specific amplification of each Klk transcript was confirmed by subcloning of the PCR products into pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen) and sequencing on an 8800 CEQ DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Klk-1 and -13 mRNA levels were quantified by real time PCR on a GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR green (Applied Biosystems) for detection of the amplified products. The reactions were conducted following the conditions for the conventional PCR described above and were normalized with the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Analysis of Autoantibody Cross-reactivity—Autoantibodies bound to purified Klk-1 and -13 on polyvinylidene difluoride filters were extracted in 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.8) and neutralized with 2.0 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Reactivity of purified autoantibodies were then separately examined against Klk-1 and -13 by immunoblotting. Generation of Klk-1 Recombinant Proteins—The open reading frame encoding the full-length each subunit of heterodimeric Klk-1 was amplified by PCR using kidney cDNA of IQI/Jic mice as a template with the following primers: heavy chain, 5′-GGATCCATTGTTGGAGGATTTAACTGTGAG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTCATTTGACGGGTGTAATGCTGC-3′; light chain, 5′-GGATCCTATGAATACCCAGATGAGCTCC-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTCAGTCATTTTCAGCCATAGTTTC-3′. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of recombinant proteins fused with glutathione S-transferase was induced in Escherichia coli BL21 by incubation with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (Wako). Inclusion bodies were extracted in a bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) and solubilized in 6.0 m guanidine HCl (pH 8.5). The products were purified by gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 75HR column equilibrated with 6.0 m guanidine HCl (pH 8.5). Proliferation Assay—Splenocytes (1 × 106 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Corning, New York, NY) in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin in the presence or the absence of Klks (0.05–50 μg/ml) or bovine serum albumin (Sigma) (10 μg/ml). During the last 20 h of the 72-hour culture period, the cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well; ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA), and the incorporation was counted by liquid scintillation. To normalize pooled results, the data were presented as cpm of cultures with antigens divided by cpm of cultures without antigens (stimulation index). Serine Protease Inhibitor—To block proteolytic activity of tissue Klks, AEBSF (Sigma) was used according to a previous report (27Murakami K. Ikigai H. Nagumo T. Tomita M. Shimamura T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Purified Klks from the salivary extract at 37 nm were incubated with 3.7 mm AEBSF at 37 °C for 60 min. Klks treated with AEBSF were separated from free AEBSF by gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 75HR column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then tested for the proliferative response of splenocytes. Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Anti-salivary Autoantibodies in IQI/Jic Mice—To examine the presence of circulating autoantibodies in IQI/Jic mice, we first performed immunoblot analysis of various tissue homogenates from IQI/Jic mice with sera from IQI/Jic mice and nonautoimmune control mice, including BALB/c and C57BL/6. Sera from all strains generated similar patterns of signals around 25 and 50 kDa in size that were bound in extracts of almost all organs. These signals appeared to be derived from direct binding of the second antibody (anti-mouse IgG) with light and heavy chains of IgG in tissue extracts, because they were recognized even in immunoblotting without serum (Fig. 1A). Notably, sera from IQI/Jic mice reacted with 18- and 16-kDa polypeptides in salivary gland extracts with high intensities, whereas sera from age-matched control mice did not show such signals in immunoblotting (Fig. 1A), indicating that IQI/Jic mice had autoantibodies to these polypeptides relatively characteristic of the salivary gland, a primary target organ in their autoimmune disease. These autoantibodies appeared in sera of IQI/Jic mice from 12 weeks of age onward; autoantibodies were detected in three of six mice examined at the age of 12 weeks and in all mice at the ages of 16, 32, and 48 weeks (six of six for each age group). In addition, signal intensities in immunoblotting increased as the mice aged when tissue extracts from 16-week-old IQI/Jic mice were used for antigens (data not shown). Although sera from several IQI/Jic mice showed faint bands of some other polypeptides in nontarget organs, including the brain, liver, and/or stomach (Fig. 1A), the pathologic significance of these signals was obscure, and they were excluded from further examination in this study. Identification of the 18- and 16-kDa Salivary Antigens—To identify the autoantigens, the 18- and 16-kDa polypeptides in the salivary glands of IQI/Jic mice were purified by a series of chromatographies based on recognition with autoantibodies in immunoblotting. After a sequential procedure employing anion and cation exchange chromatographies followed by gel permeation, the 18- and 16-kDa polypeptides were separated to homogeneity on a reversed phase chromatography column (Fig. 1, B and C). Sequencing analysis gave a single N-terminal amino acid sequence for each 18- and 16-kDa polypeptide purified. The N-terminal sequence of the 18-kDa polypeptide consisting of 18 amino acid residues was identical to that of the heavy chain of murine kallikrein (Klk)-1/glandular Klk-6 (28Hosoi K. Tsunasawa S. Kurihara K. Aoyama H. Ueha T. Murai T. Sakiyama F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) except for two unidentified residues, the seventh and fourteenth residues, as shown in Fig. 1D. Likewise, the 16-kDa polypeptide was identified as Klk-13/glandular Klk-13 (28Hosoi K. Tsunasawa S. Kurihara K. Aoyama H. Ueha T. Murai T. Sakiyama F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) heavy chain (Fig. 1D). Here the first 20 amino acid residues were identical to those of Klk-13, again except for two unidentified residues. These Klks are known to be heterodimeric molecules consisting of heavy and light chains, and the primary structures of heavy chains are highly homologous (28Hosoi K. Tsunasawa S. Kurihara K. Aoyama H. Ueha T. Murai T. Sakiyama F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Tada J. Kanamori N. Tsumura K. Hosoi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as represented by the N-terminal sequences shown in Fig. 1D. Expression Profiling of Klk-1 and -13—Immunoblotting analysis also showed that the 18- and 16-kDa antigens in the salivary glands of IQI/Jic mice became abundant as the mice aged, that is, these polypeptides were clearly observed in salivary extracts from mice older than 16 weeks but not in those from young animals at the age of 4 weeks (Fig. 2A). These observations coincided with our previous findings that inflammatory infiltrations in the salivary glands were apparent in old mice (>16 weeks) but not in young mice (21Takada K. Takiguchi M. Konno A. Inaba M. Rheumatology. 2004; 43: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that the production of autoantibodies and the apparent increase of the antigens were associated with the development of the disease in IQI/Jic mice. The absence or the very low intensities of 18- and 16-kDa polypeptides in tissues from BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 2A) raised the possibility that the contents of these antigens were extremely low or that antigenicities of these polypeptides in control mice were different from those in IQI/Jic mice. Moreover, if Klk-1 and/or Klk-13 were associated with the disease development as autoantigens, their expression in various tissues could be expected, because IQI/Jic mice spontaneously develop inflammatory lesions in the lacrimal gland, lung, pancreas, and kidney in addition to the salivary gland (21Takada K. Takiguchi M. Konno A. Inaba M. Rheumatology. 2004; 43: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although no bands were visualized on immunoblots of extracts from these tissues (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we then examined the expression of Klk-1 and -13 in these target organs from IQI/Jic mice by reverse transcription-PCR and found that the transcripts of these Klks were present in all of these tissues (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, quantitative PCR analyses demonstrated the abundance of Klk-1 and -13 transcripts in the salivary gland at levels clearly distinguishable from those in other organs (Fig. 2C). In addition, cloning and sequencing of Klk-1 and -13 cDNAs of various organs from IQI/Jic mice demonstrated that the deduced amino acid sequences of these Klks were identical to those reported for ICR (28Hosoi K. Tsunasawa S. Kurihara K. Aoyama H. Ueha T. Murai T. Sakiyama F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and BALB/c (30Evans B.A. Drinkwater C.C. Richards R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8027-8034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mice, 2K. Takada, M. Takiguchi, and M. Inaba, unpublished data. negating the possibility of structural differences for Klks among strains as the cause of the absence or low intensities of 18- and 16-kDa bands in tissues from control mice on the immunoblot (Fig. 2A). Cross-reactivity of Serum Autoantibodies with Reduced Klks—SDS-PAGE under reduced and nonreduced conditions showed that purified Klk-1 and -13 were heterodimeric molecules in which heavy and light chains were linked via disulfide bonds (Fig. 3A). Immunoblot analysis revealed that autoantibodies found in IQI/Jic mice were clearly reactive with the 18-kDa (Klk-1) and 16-kDa (Klk-13) heavy chains of reduced forms but not with native Klks or the light chains of the reduced forms (Fig. 3A). This was verified by the observation that the recombinant glutathione S-transferase-fused protein of Klk-1 heavy chain specifically reacted with sera from IQI/Jic mice, whereas the light chain recombinant protein showed no positive reactions (Fig. 3B). Because heavy chains of murine Klk-1 and -13 are known to be highly homologous in their primary structures (28Hosoi K. Tsunasawa S. Kurihara K. Aoyama H. Ueha T. Murai T. Sakiyama F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Tada J. Kanamori N. Tsumura K. Hosoi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we then examined the cross-reactivity of autoantibodies in sera of IQI/Jic mice with these antigens. Immunoblot analysis showed that autoantibodies once bound to Klk-1 and -13 reacted with Klk-13 and Klk-1, respectively (Fig. 3C). Cellular Autoreactivity with Klk-13 in IQI/Jic Mice— Splenocytes from IQI/Jic mice were tested for proliferation in response to purified Klks to investigate the reactivity of T cells with these molecules. As shown in Fig. 4A, spleen cells from IQI/Jic mice of various ages showed significant proliferative responses to native Klk-1 and -13 but not to the control antigen, bovine serum albumin. The proliferative response to Klk-13 was specifically observed in IQI/Jic mice. In contrast, the response to Klk-1 was detected in normal BALB/c and C57BL/6 as well. It has been demonstrated that Klk-1 enhances the spontaneous proliferation of lymphocytes through its enzymatic activity of serine protease (27Murakami K. Ikigai H. Nagumo T. Tomita M. Shimamura T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Treatment of antigens with a serine protease inhibitor, AEBSF, completely abolished the proliferative response to Klk-1 of splenocytes not only from control mice but also from IQI/Jic mice (Fig. 4B). However, the significant response to Klk-13 in IQI/Jic mice was evident even after the treatment with AEBSF (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4B also shows that T cell auotoreactivity with Klk-13 appeared spontaneously in IQI/Jic mice at the age of 4 weeks, much earlier than the occurrence of inflammatory lesions and production of serum autoantibodies and was maintained at a constant level afterward. Moreover, proliferation of T cells from IQI/Jic mice was elicited in response to Klk-13 in a dose-dependent manner but not in response to Klk-1 over a wide range of concentrations from 0.05 to 50 μg/ml (Fig. 4C). We previously reported that the IQI/Jic strain of mice is a unique model for SS, because it represents the autoimmune epithelitis process, progressing from salivary-specific disorders to the involvement of multiple organs with inflammatory cellular infiltrations (21Takada K. Takiguchi M. Konno A. Inaba M. Rheumatology. 2004; 43: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated the presence of autoantibodies reactive with the extract of salivary glands, the primary target of autoimmunity, in the sera of IQI/Jic mice (Fig. 1A) and identified the antigens as kallikrein (Klk)-1 and -13 (Fig. 1, B–D). Autoantibodies in sera of IQI/Jic mice were cross-reactive with these Klks (Fig. 3C), and T cell proliferation occurred specifically in response to Klk-13, regardless of the treatment with a serine protease inhibitor (Fig. 4). Based on these results, we concluded that IQI/Jic mice bear T cell autoimmunity against Klk-13, and the resulting autoantibodies are reactive with Klk-1 as well, presumably because of high homology in the amino acid sequences of these molecules (28Hosoi K. Tsunasawa S. Kurihara K. Aoyama H. Ueha T. Murai T. Sakiyama F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Tada J. Kanamori N. Tsumura K. Hosoi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Transcripts of Klk-13 were detected commonly in various target organs (Fig. 2B), and their expression levels were significantly higher in the salivary gland than in other organs in IQI/Jic mice (Fig. 2C). Klk-13, formerly designated prorenin converting enzyme B (31Kim W.S. Nakayama K. Nakagawa T. Kawamura Y. Haraguchi K. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19283-19287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or epidermal growth factor-binding protein B (32Isackson P.J. Silverman R.E. Blaber M. Server A.C. Nichols R.A. Shooter E.M. Bradshaw R.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), has been considered to be expressed most abundantly in the duct epithelial cells in salivary glands (33Clements J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 393-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Uddin M. Polley-Mandal M. Beg O.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), where the lesions of lymphocytic infiltrations initially appear in IQI/Jic mice (21Takada K. Takiguchi M. Konno A. Inaba M. Rheumatology. 2004; 43: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Accordingly, autoimmune reaction against Klk-13 could play a critical role in disease progression from periductal infiltrations within salivary glands to systemic autoimmune conditions targeting multiple organs in IQI/Jic mice. To ensure the correlation of autoimmunity against Klk-13 with the development or spread of the disease in IQI/Jic mice, future studies should include in vivo analyses of the adoptive transfer of Klk-13-reactive T cells (35Zekzer D. Wong F.S. Ayalon O. Millet I. Altieri M. Shintani S. Solimena M. Sherwin R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 36Winer S. Tsui H. Lau A. Song A. Li X.

Saito I. Noji S. Sugino H. Hayashi Y. Science. 1997; 276: 604-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) or intrathymic (37Tisch R. Yang X.D. Singer S.M. Liblau R.S. Fugger L. McDevitt H.O. Nature. 1993; 366: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) injection of Klk-13. Klks are a group of serine proteases generally classified into two major categories based on their localization: one in blood plasma called plasma Klk and another secreted mainly by glandular organs called tissue Klk (26Olsson A.Y. Lundwall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Their general function is to convert inactive kininogen to active kinins, which have been considered to regulate the local blood pressure, blood flow, and electrolyte balance (33Clements J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 393-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Additionally, accumulating evidence indicates that the kallikrein cascade plays a significant role in the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory responses (38Proud D. Kaplan A.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 49-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 39Bhoola K. Ramsaroop R. Plendl J. Cassim B. Dlamini Z. Naicker S. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, significant increases of Klk-1 and -13, both tissue Klks, were observed in salivary glands from IQI/Jic mice at the age of 16 weeks, subsequently being at an equivalent level afterward up to 48 weeks of age (Fig. 2A). We previously reported that, in IQI/Jic mice, minute sialoadenitis could be detected at the age of 8 weeks, and focal infiltration of mononuclear cells became apparent after 16 weeks of age, progressing to severe parenchymal destruction as they aged (20Konno A. Takada K. Saegusa J. Takiguchi M. Autoimmunity. 2003; 36: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Takada K. Takiguchi M. Konno A. Inaba M. Rheumatology. 2004; 43: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that up-regulation of Klks in salivary glands involves the early development of sialoadenitis in IQI/Jic mice. In humans, saliva from patients with SS has been reported to contain significantly increased levels of Klks considered to be derived from affected duct epithelial cells (40Friberg B. Jonsson R. Linde A. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 1988; 6: 135-138PubMed Google Scholar, 41Hernandez C.C. Donadi E.A. Reis M.L. J. Rheumatol. 1998; 25: 2381-2384PubMed Google Scholar). However, similar to our findings in IQI/Jic mice, no correlation has been found between the Klk levels in saliva and the severity of disease, including the amount of saliva production and the histological degree of inflammatory lesions in the affected tissues in these patients (40Friberg B. Jonsson R. Linde A. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 1988; 6: 135-138PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, increased Klks could result from the early inflammation in salivary glands to form a basis for the progression or persistence of sialoadenitis in IQI/Jic mice. Furthermore, release of an increased amount of Klk-13 from the salivary glands infiltrated by antigen-presenting cells could abrogate the tolerance to this molecule and accelerate the immune reaction, acting as an autoantigen. Detailed immunoblot analysis revealed that the anti-Klk antibody in the sera of IQI/Jic mice binds to the autoantigens under the reduced condition but not to their native forms (Fig. 3A). This fully explains the negative results of a previous report (18Saegusa J. Kubota H. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 1997; 59: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and our preliminary studies 3K. Takada, M. Takiguchi, and M. Inaba, unpublished observations. in which anti-salivary autoantibodies were not detected in sera of the mice by immunohistochemistry. Serum autoantibodies reactive with salivary epithelial cells have been detected in patients with SS by immunohistochemical techniques, with prevalences of anti-salivary duct antibodies in SS of 15–78% (22MacSween R.N. Goudie R.B. Anderson J.R. Armstrong E. Murray M.A. Mason D.K. Jasani M.K. Boyle J.A. Buchanan W.W. Williamson J. Ann. Rheum.

Med. 1999; 28: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our serological evaluation in IQI/Jic mice suggests a limitation of this conventional method, which could have failed to detect putative autoantibodies generated against the epitopes hidden within the native dimeric molecules. In addition, various autoantibodies have been shown to directly relate to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases by recognizing native antigens and hampering their physiological functions (42Lindstrom J. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 43Vincent A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 44Okazaki T. Tanaka Y.

In patients with SS (8Waterman S.A. Gordon T.P. Rischmueller M. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and a murine model (45Esch T.R. Taubman M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 842: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), glandular secretions are impaired by autoantibodies directed against autonomic nervous system receptors, including muscarinic receptors, on the cell surface of lacrimal and salivary glands. However, the autoantibodies in IQI/Jic mice are unlikely to cause the alteration of enzymatic activity of Klks to affect local inflammatory responses because of the lack of association between the autoantibody and native Klks. In conclusion, we identified Klk-13 as an autoantigen in the IQI/Jic mouse model for SS. Overexpression of Klk-13 in the early phase of sialoadenitis is believed to increase autoreactive T cells capable of generating an autoimmune response against multiple organs commonly expressing Klk-13. Our results provide insights into the role of autoantigens in the disease progress from organ-specific to systemic disorder in SS. We thank Drs.

The implications of the Fe-S center in an enzyme that is so closely associated with the metabolism of sulfur and iron are discussed. In plants siroheme is found as a prosthetic group in just two enzymes, sulfite and nitrite reductases (1Crane B.R. Getzoff E.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 744-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze the six electron reduction of sulfite and nitrite, respectively, and since the majority of cellular sulfur and nitrogen is processed via these enzymes, they are essential for sulfur and nitrogen metabolism in all living organisms. Central to the catalytic activity of these enzymes is the role played by siroheme (1Crane B.R. Getzoff E.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 744-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which is an iron-containing isobacteriochlorin (2Murphy M.J. Siegel L.M. J. Biol.

A. 1974; 71: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This metallo-prosthetic group is a modified tetrapyrrole similar in structure to both heme and chlorophyll (4Warren M.J. Scott A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 486-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The structural commonality among modified tetrapyrroles reflects their synthesis along a branched biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1). In higher plants tetrapyrrole synthesis occurs largely in the plastid (5Cornah J.E. Terry M.J. Smith A.G. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), where it is initiated by the reduction of the glutamyl moiety of glutamyl-tRNA to glutamate-1-semialdehyde (6Moser J.

Nature. 1986; 322: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Intermolecular transamination of glutamate semialdehyde generates 5-aminolevulinic acid, which is then transformed into the first macrocyclic intermediate of the pathway, uroporphyrinogen III (uro'gen III), 1The abbreviations used are: Uro'gen III, uroporphyrinogen III; SirA, uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase; SirB, sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase; SirC, dihydrosirohydrochlorin dehydrogenase; At-SirB, A. thaliana sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase; CbiK, sirohydrochlorin cobaltochelatase; CbiX, sirohydrochlorin cobaltochelatase; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; HemH, protoporphyrin IX ferrochelatase; Met8p, bifunctional dihydrosirohydrochlorin dehydrogenase and sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase; UPM1, uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. by the action of the enzymes 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, porphobilinogen deaminase, and uro'gen III synthase (4Warren M.J. Scott A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 486-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Uro'gen III represents the first branch point in the pathway (Fig. 1), as methylation of this intermediate directs it toward siroheme synthesis, whereas decarboxylation steers it toward heme and chlorophyll synthesis (8Phillips J.D. Whitby F.G. Kushner J.P. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6225-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For siroheme synthesis, methylation occurs at positions 2 and 7, forming dihydrosirohydrochlorin (9Warren M.J. Stolowich N.J. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Sowa B.A. Scott A.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction, uro'gen III methyltransferase (UPM1), requires S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl donor and has been characterized from a wide variety of sources including eubacteria (10Robin C. Blanche F. Cauchois L. Cameron B. Couder M. Crouzet J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4893-4896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Blanche F. Debussche L. Thibaut D. Crouzet J. Cameron B. J.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4637-4645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and higher plants (13Sakakibara H. Takei K. Sugiyama T. Plant J. 1996; 10: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Leustek T. Smith M. Murillo M. Singh D.P. Smith A.G. Woodcock S.C. Awan S.J. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2744-2752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis thaliana UPM1 has been localized to the chloroplast (14Leustek T. Smith M. Murillo M.

To complete the synthesis of siroheme, dihydrosirohydrochlorin has to be oxidized to sirohydrochlorin and then chelated with ferrous iron. In yeast, these two steps are catalyzed by a single bifunctional enzyme called Met8p (15Raux E. McVeigh T. Peters S.E. Leustek T. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 701-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which houses both dehydrogenase and chelatase functionalities within the same active site (16Schubert H.L. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Leech H.K. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2068-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, no orthologues of Met8p are found in higher plants. In some bacteria, the transformation of dihydrosirohydrochlorin into siroheme is catalyzed by two separate enzymes called SirC (dihydrosirohydrochlorin dehydrogenase) and SirB (sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase) (17Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem.

The latter inserts ferrous iron into sirohydrochlorin to give siroheme, and the enzyme displays a high degree of similarity to the cobaltochelatase (CbiX) found in the anaerobic pathway of cobalamin (vitamin B12) synthesis, which inserts cobalt into sirohydrochlorin (19Leech H.K. Raux E. McLean K.J. Munro A.W. Robinson N.J. Borrelly G.P. Malten M. Jahn D. Rigby S.E. Heathcote P. Warren M.J. J. Biol.

Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a class II tetrapyrrole biosynthetic chelatase, defined as a chelatase that exists as either a monomer or homodimer and which does not require ATP for activity (20Brindley A.A. Raux E. Leech H.K. Schubert H.L. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22388-22395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Within this class are included the protoporphyrin ferrochelatases (HemH) of heme synthesis (21Dailey H.A. Dailey T.A. Wu C.K. Medlock A.E. Wang K.F. Rose J.P. Wang B.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1909-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Nikonov S. Jonsson B. Hederstedt L.

Raux E. Wilson K.S. Warren M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10660-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and CbiX (19Leech H.K. Raux E. McLean K.J. Munro A.W. Robinson N.J. Borrelly G.P.

The structures of HemH and CbiK have been determined by x-ray crystallography, and these have revealed a high level of structural similarity indicating that the proteins have probably arisen by divergent evolution from a common ancestor (22Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Nikonov S. Jonsson B. Hederstedt L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1501-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23Schubert H.L. Raux E. Wilson K.S. Warren M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10660-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This structural similarity is only reflected in an approximate 10% sequence identity. Although SirB and CbiX share about 40% sequence identity, they also display a lower sequence identity (∼15%) with CbiK, suggesting that they, too, will be structurally similar. The structures of HemH and CbiK revealed that the enzymes are composed of two main α/β domains that are related to one another by a pseudo-2-fold symmetry (22Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Nikonov S. Jonsson B. Hederstedt L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1501-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23Schubert H.L. Raux E. Wilson K.S. Warren M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10660-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This suggested that the protein structure had arisen from a gene duplication and fusion event. In support of this theory, cobaltochelatases (CbiX) have recently been identified in Archaea that are only about half the size of those in eubacteria and which can be aligned to either one of the two structural domains (20Brindley A.A. Raux E. Leech H.K. Schubert H.L. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22388-22395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These shorter versions of CbiX have been termed CbiXS to differentiate them from the longer versions (CbiXL). In this paper we describe the identification of a plant sirB orthologue in the genome of Arabidopsis by similarity searching. We have cloned a cDNA for this gene and have demonstrated its function both in vivo and in vitro. Sequence analysis of the mature form of the enzyme reveals that it is only about half the size of the bacterial SirB proteins. We have investigated the subcellular location of the enzyme within the plant cell and investigated the properties of the recombinant enzyme.

The vectors were 1) pET14b (Novagen), which allows the encoded protein product to be overproduced as an N-terminal His-tagged fusion protein, 2) pETac (pET14b harboring a tac promoter instead of a T7 promoter), which can be used for complementation studies of an Escherichia coli cysG mutant strain (25Griffiths L.A.

In Vivo Complementation of an E. coli cysG Mutant Strain—The E. coli cysG mutant strain 302Δa (25Griffiths L.A. Cole J.A. Arch.

This resultant strain was then transformed with the different pETac constructs (Table I) and plated onto LB plates containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The recombinant strains were finally restreaked on M9 medium or M9 medium supplemented with either cysteine (50 mg/liter), cobalt chloride (5 μm), nickel sulfate (5 μm), or copper sulfate (5 μm) followed by incubation for 24 h at 37 °C (26Raux E. Thermes C. Heathcote P. Rambach A. Warren M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The empty pETac vector and the construct containing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MET8 gene were used as controls (16Schubert H.L. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Leech H.K. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J.

Vierstra R.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) was used for transient expression in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). Leaves from sterile-grown 4-week-old plants were used. At-SirB-GFP was introduced by biolistic transformation, and the location of GFP fluorescence was determined by confocal microscopy as described (28Cleary S.P. Tan F.C. Nakrieko K.A. Thompson S.J.

Purification of At-SirB—E. coli BL21star(DE3)(pLysS) was transformed with the three pET14b constructs harboring the cDNA with start codons at Met1, V46M, and G79M, named pET14b-AtSirB1, pET14b-AtSirB46, and pET14b-AtSirB79, respectively. They were subsequently grown in LB supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.4 mm) was added when the cells reached an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm and were left overnight at 16 °C. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 5 mm imidazole (buffer A). The cells were lysed by sonication and spun at 15000 × g for 30 min to pellet the cell debris and membranous fraction. The supernatant containing the soluble cell extract was applied to a column (4 ml) of chelating Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) that had previously been charged with 50 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A and a further 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 80 mm imidazole. Finally, the His-tagged protein was eluted from the column in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1 m imidazole. In Vitro Analysis of At-SirB Kinetics—Chelatase assays were performed as described previously (16Schubert H.L. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Leech H.K. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2068-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by monitoring the conversion of sirohydrochlorin into either cobalt-sirohydrochlorin or siroheme. Sirohydrochlorin was generated in situ under an atmosphere of nitrogen in a glove box with less than 2 ppm oxygen. This was accomplished by incubating 2.5 mg of porphobilinogen in a total volume of 40 ml containing 5 mg of purified porphobilinogen deaminase, 1 mg of purified uro'gen III synthase, 5 mg of purified uro'gen III methyltransferase, 15 mg of S-adenosyl-l-methionine, 5 mg of a dihydrosirohydrochlorin dehydrogenase (SirC), and 10 mg of NAD+ (17Raux E.

The reaction was left overnight at room temperature to allow it to reach completion, and the mixture was filtered before use. The rate of the chelatase reaction was calculated by measuring the rate of disappearance of sirohydrochlorin at 376 nm using the extinction coefficient of 2.4 × 105 m-1 cm-1. The chelatase activity was measured with sirohydrochlorin (2.5 μm), Co2+ (20 μm), or Fe2+ (20 μm) and varying amounts of At-SirB in a 1-ml reaction volume in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. For all reactions initial rates were recorded on a Hewlett Packard 8452A photodiode array spectrophotometer, and assays were performed in triplicate in the glove box. Preparation of Samples for EPR and Their Analysis—EPR samples were prepared with protein isolated from the strain containing the pET14b-ATSirB79 construct, which was grown in 4 liters of super LB (32 g/liter peptone, 20 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter sodium chloride). The purification was carried out as described above except that it was performed under anaerobic conditions in a glove box (Belle technology) in an atmosphere of less than 2 ppm oxygen. After the metal chelate column, the brown-colored fraction was collected and applied to a gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 100 mm NaCl. EPR samples were prepared in the glove box, loaded into EPR tubes, sealed with a cap, and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples of the protein were prepared plus or minus 500 μm dithionite. EPR spectra were obtained at X-band using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 liquid helium cryostat. Redox Potentiometry—Redox titrations were performed in a Belle Technology glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere essentially as described previously (29Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All solutions were degassed under vacuum with argon. Oxygen levels were maintained at less than 2 ppm. The protein solution, ∼200 μm in 8 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, was titrated electrochemically according to the method of Dutton (30Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) using sodium dithionite as reductant and potassium ferricyanide as oxidant. Mediators (2 μm phenazine methosulfate, 5 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 0.5 μm methyl viologen, and 1 μm benzyl viologen) were included to mediate in the range between +100 to -480 mV, as described previously (29Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 31Ost T.W. Miles C.S. Munro A.W. Murdoch J. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13421-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At least 15 min was allowed to elapse between each addition of reductant or oxidant to allow stabilization of the electrode. Spectra (300-800 nm) were recorded using a Cary UV-50 Bio UV-visible scanning spectrophotometer via a fiber optic absorption probe (Varian) immersed in the enzyme solution and connected to the external spectrophotometer. The electrochemical potential of the solution was measured using a Hanna pH 211 meter coupled to a Pt/calomel electrode (ThermoRussell Ltd.) at 25 °C. The electrode was calibrated using the Fe3+/Fe2+ EDTA couple as a standard (+108 mV). A factor of +244 mV was used to correct relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Absorption versus potential data at appropriate wavelengths (reflecting maximal changes in spectral properties between oxidized and reduced enzyme) were fitted to the Nernst equation to derive the apparent midpoint reduction potential (E) for the one-electron reduction of the bound iron-sulfur cluster. Identification of a Putative A. thaliana sirB Gene—The transformation of uro'gen III into siroheme requires the action of up to three enzymes, a uro'gen III methyltransferase, a dehydrogenase, and a ferrochelatase (Fig. 1). In E. coli, a single enzyme encoded by cysG catalyzes all three reactions (32Stroupe M.E. Leech H.K. Daniels D.S. Warren M.J. Getzoff E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In yeast this transformation requires two enzymes called Met1p (a uro'gen III methyltransferase) and Met8p (a bifunctional dehydrogenase and ferrochelatase) (16Schubert H.L. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Leech H.K. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2068-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, in other bacteria such as Bacillus megaterium, these activities are housed within three separate enzymes called SirA (uro'gen III methyltransferase), SirC (dihydrosirohydrochlorin dehydrogenase), and SirB (sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase) (17Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We had already shown that Arabidopsis contains a functional SirA orthologue UPM1 (14Leustek T. Smith M. Murillo M. Singh D.P. Smith A.G. Woodcock S.C. Awan S.J. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2744-2752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using the BLAST algorithm we were unable to identify orthologues in the Arabidopsis genome or in any plant EST data base of SirC. However, a hypothetical protein encoded by At1g50170 (Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, 2000) displayed similarity to SirB (e value, 1e-08). The gene is predicted to encode a protein of 225 amino acids, with 28% identity to B. megaterium SirB (Fig. 2a). Primers were designed to the predicted 5′ and 3′ ends of the gene and used to amplify the sequence by PCR from a cDNA library (24Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified product was cloned into pETac (Table I), and the resulting plasmid (pETac-AtsirB1) was introduced into E. coli strain 302Δa::pACYC184-lacIq-PdcobA, which is a sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase mutant and, therefore, unable to grow in the absence of exogenous cysteine (see “Experimental Procedures”). The At1g50170 cDNA was able to complement the mutant phenotype (Table II). Previous work has shown that some cobaltochelatases can also complement sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase deficiency (26Raux E. Thermes C. Heathcote P. Rambach A. Warren M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, cobaltochelatases can be differentiated from ferrochelatases on the basis that complementation of ferrochelatase activity by cobaltochelatases is inhibited in the presence of exogenous cobalt in the medium, presumably due to competitive inhibition of the metal binding site within the chelatase (15Raux E. McVeigh T. Peters S.E. Leustek T. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 701-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At1g50170 was still able to complement the E. coli sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase-deficient strain in the presence of exogenous cobalt (Table II), indicating that it is specific as a ferrochelatase and can, thus, be assigned as the Arabidopsis SirB (At-SirB). Subsequently, further data base searching has revealed the presence of orthologues of SirB in rice (Fig. 2a) and several other plants (www.plantgdb.org).Table IIComplementation studies of a sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase deficient strain of E. coli Medium used was M9 containing chloramphenicol, and ampicillin.

https://openalex.org/W1968273349,"The Ras-cyclic AMP pathway is connected to other nutrient-regulated signaling pathways and mediates the global stress responses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that Rom2p, the Rho1 GTP/GDP exchange factor, can mediate stress responses and cell growth via the Ras-cAMP pathways. ROM2 was isolated as a suppresser of heat and NaCl sensitivity caused by the lack of the Ras-GTPase activator Ira2p or of cAMP phosphodiesterases. Subsequent analysis of strains with a rom2 deletion showed that Rom2p is essential for resistance to a variety of stresses caused by freeze-thawing, oxidants, cycloheximide, NaCl, or cobalt ions. Stress sensitivity and the growth defect caused by the rom2 deletion could be suppressed by depleting Ras or protein kinase A (PKA) activity or by overexpressing the high affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase Pde2p. In addition, overexpression of ROM2 could not rescue cells lacking the regulatory subunit of PKA, indicating that the Ras-adenylate, cyclase-PKA cascade is essential for Rom2p-mediated stress responses and cell growth. Deletion of IRA2 exacerbated the freeze-thaw sensitivity and growth defect of the rom2 mutant, indicating that Rom2p signaling may control Ras independently of IRA2. Increases in cAMP levels were detected in the rom2 deletion mutants, and these were comparable with the effects of an ira2 mutation. The effects of the deletion of ROM2 on sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, and cobalt ions, but not to caffeine, were reduced when a constitutive allele of RHO1 was introduced on a single copy plasmid. However, the effects of the deletion of ROM2 on sensitivity to diamide and NaCl were exacerbated. Taken together, our data indicate that Rom2p can regulate PKA activity by controlling cAMP levels via the Ras-cAMP pathway and that for those stresses related to oxidative stress, this cross-talk is probably mediated via the Rho1p-activated MAPK pathway.

The ability of cells to appropriately respond to alterations in environment is essential for the survival of stress situations, and processes for stress sensing and the subsequent modulation of cell physiology require the involvement of signal transduction pathways. The Ras-cyclic AMP pathway is an essential nutrient-sensing pathway in yeast (1Francois J. Parrou J.L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 2Rolland F.

TOR2 is a phosphatidylinositol kinase homolog and has an essential role in integrating nutrient signals to regulate cell growth and cell cycle progression (41Lorberg A. Hall M.N. Curr. Top.

Recently, it has been shown that the Ras-cAMP pathway can suppress a TOR deficiency in yeast (43Schmelzle T. Beck T. Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Ras-cAMP pathway mediates parts of TOR signaling. In this study, we isolated ROM2 as a suppresser of the sensitivity to heat shock or osmostress caused by lack of IRA2 or cAMP phosphodiesterases and subsequently investigated the cross-talk between Rom2p and the Ras-cAMP pathway. We show that the sensitivities to various stresses and the growth defect caused by rom2 deletion can be suppressed by modulating activity of the Ras-cAMP pathway. We also show that Rom2p can control cAMP levels in the wild-type strain. Our study demonstrates that Rom2p can mediate negative regulation of the Ras-cAMP signal transduction pathway. Strains, Media, and Transformation—The yeast strains used are described in Table I. Strain Ras2(II) was made by backcrossing JC302-26B (44Cannon J.F. Tatchell K. Mol. Cell.

The heterozygous diploid strains Jrom2/fsm, Jrom2/pde2, and Jrom2/ras2 were made by mating the strain Jrom2 with the strains Fsm4C, Jpde2, and Ras2(II) respectively. The strain Wrom2/MB12 was made by mating strain W303rom2 with strain MB12 (45Mazon M.J. Behrens M.M. Morgado E. Portillo F. Eur. J.

Yeast extract peptone dextrose (YEPD) medium contained 2% (w/v) glucose, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, and 1% (w/v) yeast extract, and synthetic minimal dextrose (SD) medium contained 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate (Oxoid), and auxotrophic requirements at 40 mg/liter where necessary. Media were solidified by adding 2% (w/v) agar. Transformation of yeast cells was carried out using lithium acetate (46Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A.

Primers used to amplify the deletion DNAs are given in Table II. PCR was performed using the single copy plasmid pRS413 as the template to prepare PDE2 or IRA2 disruption DNA and plasmid pRS414 for PDE1 disruption. Successful disruption was confirmed by PCR using primers designed from the upstream region of target DNA and from the internal region of disruption markers. Primers used for confirmation are listed in Table II. DNA for ROM2 deletion was prepared by PCR amplification of genomic DNA prepared from the rom2 deletion strain AS138-1C (38Schmidt A. Bickle M.

Successful deletion was confirmed by PCR amplification of the ROM2 region using the same primers and comparing the size of the PCR products. The pde1 pde2 double deletion mutant was made by crossing the pde1 and pde2 mutants, the subsequent sporulation of the diploid strain, and dissection.

It contains DNA from chromosome XV spanning 1,011,721–1,015,679 base pairs where PDE2 is the only intact open reading frame. Plasmid 37-3, containing DNA from chromosome XII spanning 860,720–872,193 base pairs, was cloned from a similar screening using the yeast genomic DNA library YHP1, which is constructed in the p366 vector (American Type Culture Collection number 77162). p366ROM2 was made by truncating plasmid 37–3 using BstBI. cAMP Determination—An appropriate volume of cell culture was harvested and washed in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7). Cells were homogenized in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid with glass beads. Supernatants were collected, washed with water-saturated diethyl ether, and freeze-dried. cAMP was measured using an enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences) as indicated by the manufacturer. Freezing and Thawing Conditions—Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) and suspended to an A600 of 3 in the same buffer. Aliquots (0.3 ml) of cells were transferred to thin walled 1.5-ml polycarbonate tubes (Greiner Labortechnik), frozen at –20 °C for 2 h, and thawed at room temperature for 15 min as described previously (11Park J.I. Grant C.M. Attfield P.V. Dawes I.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3818-3824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Survival was determined by diluting cells into YEPD medium at room temperature and plating on YEPD plates. Cells were grown at 30 °C for 2 days before colony counting. Assay for Stress Resistance on Plates—5 μl of cell culture, diluted to an A600 of 0.1 or 1 in fresh SD medium, was spotted onto SD plates containing 3 mm H2O2, 0.5 mm diamide, 2.5 mm paraquat, 0.25 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mm CoCl2, 7 mm caffeine, or 1.5 m NaCl and incubated at 30 °C for visualization of the phenotype. For heat shock, cells were spotted on YEPD plates and incubated at 37 °C. Long Term Starvation Survival Test—The ability of cells to survive starvation was tested as described previously (48Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-day-cultured cells were maintained in sterile water for 12 days at 30 °C. Viability was measured by counting colonies on YEPD plates and expressed as a percentage of the initial cell count. Isolation of ROM2 as a Stress Defense Gene—IRA2 and PDE2 are important genes encoding components of the Ras-cAMP signaling pathway that are important in maintaining resistance to a wide range of stress conditions (49Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Using a genomic DNA library in the single copy YHP1 vector, we isolated a plasmid that could suppress heat shock and NaCl sensitivity caused by lack of IRA2 (Fig. 1A). This plasmid, containing ARC18, ROM2, SUR4, YLR373C, and YLR374C, was subsequently truncated with BstBI to produce p366ROM2. This identified ROM2 as the gene responsible for rescue of the stress sensitivity. ROM2 overexpression could also suppress heat shock sensitivity caused by the lack of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in the pde1 pde2 double mutant, but it could not effectively rescue yeast cells lacking BCY1, which encodes the regulatory subunit of PKA (Fig. 1B). This finding indicates that Rom2p probably acts by affecting the level of cAMP, because the loss of Bcy1p leads to constitutive activation of PKA unaffected by cAMP levels. This isolation of ROM2 was interesting, because Rom2p is a component of the TOR-Rho1-PKC pathway (38Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 39Torres J. Di Como C.J. Herrero E. De La Torre-Ruiz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43495-43504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), indicating that Rom2p may mediate some form of cross-talk between the TOR-Rho1-PKC pathway and the Ras-cAMP pathway. Deletion of ROM2 Leads to Sensitivity to a Broad Range of Stresses—To examine the involvement of Rom2p in a range of stress responses, ROM2 was deleted in the wild-type strain CY4. Deletion of ROM2 rendered cells sensitive to freezing and thawing (Fig. 2A) and to H2O2, the superoxide generator paraquat, the sulfhydryl oxidant diamide, cycloheximide, NaCl, caffeine, and cobalt (Fig. 2B). Identical results were obtained with two other rom2 deletion mutant strains, AS138-1c and W303rom2, which were constructed on the different genetic backgrounds of strains JK9-3d and W303-1A, respectively (Fig. 2A illustrates the freeze-thaw response of AS138-1c; data not shown for W303rom2). These findings indicated that Rom2p is involved in a global response of yeast to a wide range of stresses and that the effect is unlikely to be restricted to one strain. Because the deletion of ROM2 elicited similar effects on stress responses as those that were noted for deletion of the negative regulators of the Ras-cAMP pathway, IRA2 or PDE2, we investigated the possibility of a relationship between Rom2p and the Ras-cAMP pathway. Rom2p Shows an Epistatic Relationship with the Ras-cAMP Pathway—To determine whether there is an epistatic relationship between Rom2p and the Ras-cAMP pathway, the rom2 deletion mutants were crossed with isogenic yeast strains carrying ras2, ira2, pde2, or the tpk1 tpk2 double deletion mutation (Table I; see also “Experimental Procedures”). Asci of the resulting diploids were dissected to generate cells carrying combinations of rom2 and each mutation. These mutants were then examined for their freeze-thaw stress resistance. The ras2 deletion was found to completely nullify the freeze-thaw sensitivity and growth defect caused by the rom2 deletion (Fig. 3A). Likewise, the tpk1 tpk2 double deletion also suppressed the freeze-thaw sensitivity and growth defect of the rom2 mutant (Fig. 3D), indicating that components of the Ras-adenylate cyclase-PKA cascade (including the PKA activity) are essential for the ROM2-mediated freeze-thaw stress response and cell growth. Meanwhile, the deletion of IRA2 or PDE2, which are the negative regulators of the Ras-cAMP pathway, exacerbated the freeze-thaw sensitivity and growth defect of the rom2 mutant (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that ROM2 may affect PKA activity in parallel with IRA2 or PDE2. To further investigate this possibility, we examined the effect of overexpressing PDE2 in the rom2 mutant. If the role of Rom2p in some of the stress responses is mediated by negative regulation of the Ras-cAMP pathway, overexpression of PDE2 should compensate for the rom2 deletion. Indeed, overexpression of PDE2 did confer stress tolerance to freeze-thawing (Fig. 2A) and to peroxides, paraquat, and cobalt (Fig. 2B). It also increased starvation survival of the rom2 mutant about 25-fold. After a long-term (12-day) starvation of yeast cells in water, the rom2 mutant showed ∼2% survival in the absence of PDE2 overexpression, but this increased to ∼50% with PDE2 overexpression; the wild-type CY4 did not lose viability under these conditions. However, and interestingly, overexpression of PDE2 did not confer resistance to diamide, cycloheximide, NaCl, or caffeine-induced stress (Fig. 2B), indicating that Rom2p can also mediate stress responses that are independent of PKA. Taken together, these data indicate that Rom2p may play a substantial part of its role in some stress responses and cell growth by negatively regulating the Ras-cAMP pathway. Rom2p Can Affect Intracellular cAMP Levels—As indicated above, if Rom2p affects the activity of the PKA pathway, one way would involve its acting to alter the intracellular level of cAMP. We therefore further characterized Rom2p-mediated regulation of the Ras-cAMP pathway by determining the effects of deleting ROM2 on cellular cAMP levels. The level of cAMP was determined in the wild-type and in the rom2 mutant strain, Jrom2, during both exponential growth (6–7 h of culture; A600 = 1) and the stationary phase (48 h of culture). In both growth phases, the rom2 mutant showed elevated levels of cAMP (∼1.8-fold higher than wild-type levels), and this was only slightly lower than the level caused by deletion of IRA2, which is one of the main negative regulators of the Ras-cAMP pathway (Table III). Taken together, our data indicate that Rom2p can modulate cAMP levels through the Ras-adenylate cyclase cascade and thus mediate stress responses and cell growth.Table IIIDetermination of cAMP levelsStraincAMPaCells were grown in YEPD medium.

https://openalex.org/W2038587180,"The TP63 gene, a member of the TP53 gene family, encodes several isoforms with (TAp63) or without (ΔNp63) transactivating properties. Whereas the role of p63 in the normal development of squamous epithelia is well established, its function in other cell types remains to be elucidated. Here, we have analysed the expression of TA and ΔNp63 isoforms in liver cells, by using both primary hepatocytes from wild type and p53-null mice and three human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, according to the transformation state and the TP53 status of the cells. We observed the expression of ΔNp63 isoforms only in a p53-null context. On the other hand, the expression of TAp63 isoforms was restricted to the HCC cell lines, whatever the TP53 status. We then studied the expression of TP63 upon genotoxic treatment. When treated with UVB or H2O2, hepatocytes did not exhibit any change in p63 mRNA level. At the opposite, upon treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors (doxorubicin or etoposide), the expression of TAp63 isoforms was clearly induced, independently of the TP53 status of cells. The same treatment did not induce any variation in the expression of ΔNp63 isoforms, both at mRNA and protein levels. In HCC cell lines, doxorubicin or etoposide treatment also resulted in an increase of TAp63 transcripts only. This increase was accompanied by an increase in the intracellular level of TAp63 alpha protein. In parallel, we observed an upregulation of some p53-target genes related to cell cycle regulation, such as WAF1/CIP1, PIG3, 14-3-3σ or GADD45, independently of the TP53 status of cells. In conclusion, we report for the first time that TA and ΔNp63 alpha proteins are present in liver cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that p63 may partially substitute for wild-type p53, in counteracting uncontrolled liver cell proliferation in response to certain forms of DNA-damage."

The proper regulation of TLR signaling is important in limiting septic shock, inflammation, and various aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity. The ligation of the TLR4-MD2 complex by LPS induces the recruitment of the MyD88 and subsequent activation of both interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase and TNF receptor-associated factor-6. Activation of these molecules leads to signaling via the NF-κB and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Whereas a significant response to a bacterial infection is often required for protective immunity, elevated levels of cytokine protection can have deleterious effects; for example, toxic shock and systemic inflammatory syndrome. Repeated exposure to LPS induces a protective condition, termed LPS tolerance, that prevents shock following challenge with otherwise lethal levels of endotoxin. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the development of this refractory state: TLR4 down-regulation (1Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi K. Kimoto M. Miyake K.

Interferons are capable of regulating transcription through a variety of transcriptional complexes; principle examples include the STAT-1 homodimer binding to an IFN-γ activation site element and ISGF3, which binds the IFN-stimulated regulatory element. However, in the case of SOCS-1, neither of these complexes binds directly to the promoter. Instead, IRF-1 (which contains its own IFN-γ activation site element (22Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y.

Blood. 2003; 101: 3940-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).We present evidence that the LPS-induced activity of the SOCS-1 promoter is regulated by the transcription factor Egr-1. SOCS-1 expression is reduced in LPS-stimulated macrophages from Egr-1–/– versus Egr-1+/+ mice, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis indicates that the SOCS-1 promoter is bound by Egr-1 in vivo. Further, two Egr-1 binding sites are present within the SOCS-1 promoter, and mutational analysis shows that the LPS response requires these sites and an IRF-E for LPS-induced activity of the SOCS-1 promoter. Taken together, these data suggest that the SOCS-1 promoter is regulated through both Egr-1-dependent and Egr-1-independent regulatory pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHuman DNA Samples—NA12547 was purchased from the Coriell Cell Repositories.Cell Lines—THP-1, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The RAW/FPR.10 clone derived from the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line was obtained from Dr. Steve Greenberg (40Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar).Luciferase Experiments—The RAW/FPR.10 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection was performed following the manufacturer's protocol with 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 100 ng of Renilla luciferase control plasmid (Promega) for 4 h. Following this period, the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with media with or without 100 ng/ml LPS for 20 h. Cell extracts were subsequently prepared and assayed using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities were normalized to the Renilla control plasmid, and values shown are the mean of three independent experiments.Mice—The Egr-1–/– mice were provided by Dr. Shi-Fang Yan.Isolation and Differentiation of Macrophages—Bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated and generated with an adapted method (41Lutz M.B. Kukutsch N. Ogilvie A.L. Rossner S. Koch F. Romani N. Schuler G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). Instead of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, the culture medium was supplemented with 10% macrophage colony-stimulating factor-containing L929 culture supernatant at day 0. At day 3, an additional 10 ml of medium containing 10% L929 supernatant was added. Day 7 adherent cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and used in experiments.Probes—The sequence of the TNF-α competitor probe is 5′-AACCCTCTGCCCCCGCGATGGAG-3′.Plasmids—The IRF-2/pRSET plasmid used for the isolation of recombinant IRF-2 was provided by Dr. Kathryn Calame. Regions of the SOCS-1 promoter were cloned into the BglII and MluI sites of the pGL3 Basic Vector (Promega) using primers with the appropriate restriction sites, with the exception of the –1521/–659pGL3basic, –1160/–659pGL3basic, and –945/–659pGL3basic plasmids. The latter were generated by digestion of the –2523/–659pGL3basic plasmid with SacI, SacI + AvrII, or SacI + XhoI, respectively, followed by digestion of the overhangs with mung bean nuclease and ligation. Sequence mutations were made with the appropriate primers in a PCR-based mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. The pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid was purchased from Promega.Antibodies—The anti-IRF-1 (sc-640X), anti-IRF-2 (sc-498X), and anti-Egr-1 (sc-110X) antibodies for the supershift and ChIP experiments were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-SOCS-1 monoclonal antibody (4H1) was provided by Dr. Douglas Hilton. The anti-CD11b-phycoerythrin-conjugated and anti-CD16/CD32 (FcIII/FcII receptor) (Fc block) antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (42Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Recombinant IRF-2 was purified as described in Ref. 43Merika M. Williams A.J. Chen G. Collins T. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar. Binding reactions were performed for 15 min with either the indicated amounts of recombinant protein or 10 μg of nuclear extracts with a final concentration of 5.0 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 μg of dIdC and 40 μg of bovine serum albumin. Reactions were run in gels containing 6.0% acrylamide, 2.5% glycerol, and 0.25× TBE.ChIP—THP-1 cells were treated with a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde to cross-link for 10 min and subsequently stopped with the addition of glycine at a final concentration of 0.125 m for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with TBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), counted so that 1 × 107 cells were used in each immunoprecipitation and lysed in cold SDS buffer (0.5% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 5 mm, EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.02% NaN3). Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in cold IP buffer (1 volume of SDS buffer plus 0.5 volume of Triton dilution buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.02% NaN3, and 5% Triton X-100)). The protease inhibitors aprotinin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were previously added to the IP buffer. Cells were then sonicated at 4 °C and spun to remove cell debris. Extract volume was adjusted to 1.0 ml per immunoprecipitation in 1.5-ml siliconized Eppendorf tubes and precleared with 30 μl of Protein A beads (Amersham 50% slurry containing 0.2 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 0.5 mg/ml lipid-free bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Extracts were spun to remove beads, and 25 μl of lysate was removed as a total control. Primary antibodies were then added and rotated overnight at 4 °C. 30 μl of single-stranded DNA/Protein A beads were then added the following day and rotated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C before precipitating beads and washed as follows: 2 × 1.0 ml of mixed micelle buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.052% (w/v) sucrose, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% SDS), 2 × 1.0 ml of buffer 500 (0.1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% NaN3), 2 × 1.0 ml of LiCl/detergent wash (0.5% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 0.02% NaN3), and 2 × 1.0 ml of TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). 0.3 ml of a 1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3 solution was then added to both the immunoprecipitates and the total controls and incubated at 65 °C to elute complexes from beads and reverse the cross-links. Eluate was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube with 0.25 ml of a proteinase K solution (30 μg of glycogen, 100 μg of proteinase K in TE, pH 7.6) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. 50 μl of 4 m LiCl was then added, followed by 0.5 ml of 1:1 phenol/chloroform mixture. Tubes were then shaken vigorously for 1 min and phases separated by centrifugation for 10 min at room temperature. The upper phase was transferred to a separate tube with 1.0 ml of 100% ethanol and incubated on dry ice for 15 min to precipitate DNA. DNA was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min, washed with 70% ethanol, recentrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, allowed to air dry for 10 min, and resuspended in 30 μl of H2O. Input samples represent 0.05, 0.01, and 0.002% of the total DNA, whereas the PCRs of the immunoprecipitations include 10, 5, and 2.5% of the resuspended DNA. The general conditions for PCR are as follows: an initial step of 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s repeated for 30 cycles and 72 °C for 7 min. Each 25-μl PCR contained 1× High Fidelity PCR buffer, 2.0 mm MgSO4, 0.8 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.8 μm each primer, and 1.25 units of HiFi Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Primers for ChIP were as follows: promoter-5′, 5′-GTCGCCAAGTCCGAAGGA-3′; promoter-3′, 5′-CCCAGCTCCACTTTTGGT-3′; 3′-control-5′, 5′-CACTAGGCAACCGGAGGA-3′; 3′-control-3′, 5′-CTTTTGAGGAGGACCTGT-3′.RESULTSRegulation of the SOCS-1 Promoter in Response to LPS—The mechanism by which LPS induces SOCS-1 transcription has not been fully elucidated. Previous evidence has suggested that the regulation is dependent upon autocrine and paracrine cytokine signaling mechanisms, whereby the treatment of macrophages with LPS induces cytokines such as IFN-α/β to up-regulate SOCS-1 expression (19Crespo A. Filla M.B. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Dalpke A.H. Opper S. Zimmermann S. Heeg K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7082-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The JAK-STAT-independent nature of TLR signaling suggested the possibility of an additional pathway for the regulation of SOCS-1 transcription. To determine the transcriptional elements required for regulation of SOCS-1 in response to LPS, promoter constructs were cloned using DNA isolated from a human cell line. The cloned sequence corresponds with the most common allele of human SOCS-1 (data not shown). The sequence (Fig. 1) illustrates the SOCS-1 genomic locus from the –882-position relative to the translation ATG start codon. The intron/exon structure (shown by the boxed area) is defined by the cDNA sequence of SOCS-1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_003745). Both the human and murine sequence of SOCS-1 contain two exons, with the entire coding region present within the second exon.Fig. 1Structure of the human SOCS-1 promoter region. The sequence of the first and beginning of the second exon are in the shaded regions. The translation ATG initiation site is depicted in boldface letters. The GAAA repeat IRF-E is illustrated in italic type. Four GC-boxes are underlined (GGGCGG consensus). Egr-1 site 1 and site 2 (GCGGGGGCG consensus) are shown in outline and labeled as S1 and S2, respectively. The proximal GC-box overlaps with S2. The transcription initiation site is denoted with a bent arrow, and the numbers indicate the relative position from the A(+1) of the ATG initiation site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Various regions of the human SOCS-1 promoter were cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter construct, and promoter activity was assayed in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line (Fig. 2). Previous experimental evidence has demonstrated that LPS is capable of inducing endogenous SOCS-1 expression in the RAW 264.7 cell line (5Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T.

Further, overexpression of SOCS-1 is also capable of inhibiting the LPS signaling pathway in the RAW 264.7 cell line (5Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T. Seki E. Sato S. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Yamanishi K. Kawase I. Nakanishi K. Kishimoto T. Immunity. 2002; 17: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). LPS treatment elicited a moderate increase in the transcriptional activity starting with the –2523/–659 region of the SOCS-1 promoter (Fig. 2). The –945/–659 and –882/–659 regions of the SOCS-1 promoter demonstrated the most significant basal and LPS-induced activity. LPS stimulation yielded an approximate 7-fold increase in activity, which was diminished in promoter constructs lacking promoter sequence 3′ of the –864-position. The –768/–659 construct was transcriptionally unresponsive to LPS; nor did it demonstrate any significant basal promoter activity. The –768/–659 construct results were similar to the vector control lacking any SOCS-1 promoter sequence. Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in promoter activity with the loss of promoter sequence between –850 and –840, indicating that this region of the promoter may contain an LPS-inducible cisacting element. These data indicate that the –864 to –659 region of SOCS-1 includes response elements required for the maximal LPS-induced transcriptional response of the promoter.Fig. 2Functional analysis of various regions of the SOCS-1 promoter. Shown to the left are the various regions cloned into the pGL3 basic luciferase plasmid. The number indicates the start of the region relative to the translational start site. All of the SOCS-1 promoter regions extend to +46 of the transcriptional start site (+1), which is denoted by the bent arrow. The vector control indicates the pGL3 basic plasmid"

Lipid bodies in macrophages comprise lipid droplets and extensive, previously scantily characterized sheet-like organelles, which we descriptively call “lipid sails.” TIP47 and adipophilin are components of many, but not all, the lipid droplets. Both proteins are not confined to the surface of lipid droplets, as supposed, but are also inside lipid droplet cores. They are not codistributed stoichiometrically in lipid droplets. How TIP47 and adipophilin, which are polar proteins, enter the lipid droplets and are packaged among the hydrophobic neutral lipids of the core is unclear. However, in the lipid layers of the core, these proteins are directed sometimes inward and sometimes outward.

An entirely new view of the functions and composition of lipid bodies is currently emerging from studies on proteins associated with these organelles. Lipid bodies are clearly more than mere storage depots for superfluous neutral lipids in times of metabolic stress (1Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Aside from their obvious involvement in lipid homeostasis, they appear also to partake exquisitely in cell signaling (2Pol A.

Lipid bodies are metabolically active organelles in cells of virtually all animals, many plants, and even some prokaryotes (7Murphy D.J. Prog.

Several proteins with similar amino-terminal amino acid sequences and hence common structural motifs, the PAT (perilipin, adipophilin, tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa) family proteins, interact with lipid bodies in as yet unknown ways. PAT family proteins are believed to localize exclusively to the surface of lipid bodies and to be evolutionarily conserved (9Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C.

Similarities in the structure of PAT family proteins and their targeting to and localization in lipid bodies are suggestive of a common underlying function in lipid homeostasis and/or lipid body biogenesis. Among the members of the PAT family proteins, the tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa (TIP47) is still of uncertain status. TIP47 seems to be involved in delivering mannose-6-phosphate receptors from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (13Krise J.P. Sincock P.M. Orsel J.G. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol.

These two cellular compartments, lipid bodies and the late endosome sorting compartment, are currently thought to be completely divorced. Several controversial reports on the putative association of TIP47 with lipid droplets, the most common form of lipid body in eukaryotic cells, have appeared recently. Wolins et al. (15Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) described TIP47 in lipid droplets, but Barbero et al. (16Barbero P. Buell E. Zulley S. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24348-24351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) explicitly refuted this result by demonstrating that the antibody used by Wolins et al. (15Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) cross-reacts with a confirmed lipid droplet protein, adipophilin. Miura et al. (10Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol.

GFP-TIP47 appeared to be at the lipid droplet surface, despite the fact that TIP47 was also strongly expressed throughout the cytoplasm of the cells. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that TIP47 is indeed a component of lipid droplets because the fluorescence patterns from isolated lipid droplets from GFP-TIP47-, GFP-adipophilin-, and GFP-perilipin-expressing cells were indistinguishable. Until now, TIP47 has been directly visualized in lipid droplets only by immunofluorescence microscopy. Whether TIP47 is truly a component of lipid droplets and, if so, the exact spatial distribution of TIP47 (and adipophilin) inside lipid droplets still lack independent clarification, ideally using methods with higher inherent spatial resolution than that attainable by fluorescence microscopy. We studied the distribution of TIP47 and adipophilin in lipid bodies of THP-1 cell-derived macrophages at high resolution using freeze-fracture immunogold labeling and electron microscopy. We found that lipid bodies in macrophages consist of normal lipid droplets and membranous organelles, which we call “lipid sails.” We describe the relationship of lipid sails to lipid droplets and to the PAT family proteins for the first time. Our studies show that TIP47 and adipophilin are integral components of both lipid droplets and lipid sails and that lipid sails are organelles of intracellular lipid metabolism in macrophages. Antibodies—A polyclonal antibody raised in guinea pig against a synthetic polypeptide representing the amino terminus (amino acids 1–16) of human TIP47 (GP30; Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to detect TIP47. Adipophilin was immunolabeled using a mouse monoclonal antibody to a synthetic peptide representing the amino terminus (amino acids 5–27) of human adipophilin (AP 125; Progen Biotechnik). Cell Culture—Human THP-1 monocytes from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing the supplements recommended by Iwashima et al. (17Iwashima Y. Eto M. Hata A. Kaku K. Horiuchi S. Ushikubi F. Sano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 368-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and differentiated to adherent macrophages by adding 100 mm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to the medium for 3 days. Because normally cultured macrophages contain few lipid bodies, the cells were lipid-loaded before use by the further addition of 50 μg/ml acetylated low density lipoprotein at day 2 for8hto2 days as described by Hara et al. (18Hara H. Tanishita H. Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or by the addition of 600 μmol of oleic acid complexed to bovine serum albumin at a ratio of 6 mol of oleic acid per mole of albumin (15Wolins N.E.

Western Blotting—To test whether GP30 (TIP-47) cross-reacts with adipophilin, extracts from macrophages were probed with GP30 and AP 125. After removal of the medium and rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Proteins in equal amounts of lysate were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 9% gels and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After incubation in PBS containing 5% skim milk for 1 h to block nonspecific binding, the membranes were reacted with GP30 (1:1500) or AP 125 (1:20) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed in PBS containing 0.5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany) for 1 h at 37 °C, and treated with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of both TIP47 and adipophilin was performed by successively incubating the membrane with GP30 followed by AP 125 (or vice versa). Chemiluminescence signals from bound antibodies were recorded on Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Staining—Cultured THP-1 cells were differentiated and lipid-loaded in chamber slides. They were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. After extensive washing, they were incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding and 0.05% Tween 20 for permeabilization. They were immunolabeled with GP30 (1:500) and AP 125 (1:5) for 1 h, followed by washing and incubation with anti-guinea pig cy3-conjugated and anti-mouse cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). To visualize TIP47 or adipophilin and neutral lipids at the same time, the fluorophore BODIPY 493/503 (Molecular Probes), which specifically stains neutral lipids (19Gocze P.M. Freeman D.A. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), was dissolved in ethanol at 1 mg/ml and added to the secondary antibody solutions to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma). The preparations were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) and examined in a fluorescence microscope or a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Thin Sectioning—Lipid-laden macrophages were grown in flasks, fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% osmium tetroxide in PBS, and dehydrated with ethanol using standard procedures. A few milliliters of propylene oxide were added to the flasks, and the cells were removed by gently swirling and embedded in Epon as usual. Thin sections were cut in an ultramicrotome, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and photographed in the electron microscope. Ultracryo-sectioning—Lipid-laden macrophages were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, scraped from the culture vessels and prepared further for cryoimmunoelectron microscopy basically as outlined by Tokuyasu (20Tokuyasu K.T.

Freeze-fracture Immunogold Labeling—To survey for TIP47 and adipophilin in lipid bodies in the electron microscope, macrophages were lipid-laden for 2 days and freeze-fractured and replicated using metal evaporation and immunogold labeling as outlined in detail elsewhere (21Fujimoto K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Robenek M.J. Severs N.J. Schlattmann K. Plenz G. Zimmer K.-P. Troyer D. Robenek H.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1940-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, chemically unfixed macrophages were scraped from the culture flasks, incubated in 30% glycerol (for a maximum of 2 min), collected by mild centrifugation, frozen in Freon at -200 °C, and fractured in a vacuum coating unit (BA310, Balzers, Liechtenstein). The fractured cell surfaces were coated with 2 nm of platinum-carbon at an angle of 38° followed by pure carbon. The replicas were incubated overnight in 5% SDS to remove cellular material except for molecules adhering directly to the replicas, rinsed, and immunolabeled. Immunolabeling was performed with GP30 (5 μg/ml) followed by a donkey anti-guinea pig 12-nm gold conjugate, AP 125 (5 μg/ml), followed by a goat anti-mouse 18-nm gold conjugate or a mixture of GP30 and AP 125 followed by a mixture of donkey anti-guinea pig 12-nm and goat anti-mouse 18-nm gold conjugates (both conjugates were from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) as indicated in the figure legends. The interpretation of immunogold-labeled replicas of freeze-fractured cells is explained elsewhere (22Robenek M.J. Severs N.J. Schlattmann K. Plenz G. Zimmer K.-P. Troyer D. Robenek H.

Anti-TIP47 and Anti-adipophilin Antibodies React Specifically—The amino-terminal domains of TIP47 and adipophilin are known to have a high degree of homology, and one anti-serum to TIP47 is known to cross-react with adipophilin as already mentioned. Therefore, we tested the specificity of the antibodies by Western blotting. THP-1 cell extracts reacted with GP30 (TIP47) and AP 125 (adipophilin) yielded unique specific bands of 47 kDa for TIP47 and 52 kDa for adipophilin (Fig. 1). No cross-reactivity was observed. Lipid Bodies in Macrophages Consist of Lipid Droplets and Lipid Sails—Conventionally thin-sectioned THP-1 cell-derived macrophages contain solitary lipid droplets, clusters of lipid droplets, and sheet-like structures (Figs. 2 and 3). Solitary lipid droplets usually appear structureless. Clustered lipid droplets show evidence of internal structure and are often associated with the cytocenter. As we will show, the sheet-like structures are also lipid bodies, and we descriptively call them lipid sails. Lipid sails in cells exposed to acetylated low density lipoproteins (acLDLs) for 12 h are made up of individual sheets or whorls of membrane-like structures, each consisting of two surfaces separated by a lumen-like space (Fig. 3). One surface only of each lipid sail is decorated conspicuously with glycogen particles. After moderate lipid loading (12 h), lipid sails are often accompanied by solitary lipid droplets. Under prolonged lipid loading (48 h), the glycogen layer is absent (Fig. 2). Both lipid droplets and lipid sails are visible in the light microscope in phase contrast (Fig. 4A).Fig. 3Lipid droplets seem to bud off lipid sails.A, after lipid loading for 12 h with acLDL, macrophages contain many solitary lipid droplets associated with lipid sails. Lipid sails bear a unilateral coat of glycogen. Lipid sails appear obviously different than membranes of rough ER (circles). B-D, lipid droplets seem to bud off lipid sails. Thin sections.

In cryosectioned macrophages, lipid droplets appear as electron lucent vesicles with little internal structure. Labeling of adipophilin is generally found in the lipid droplet and the surrounding membrane monolayer. In such sections, it is difficult to determine exactly which structures are labeled (Fig. 4B). High levels of TIP47 immunofluorescence occur in lipid droplets in cells lipid-laden before use by acLDL (Fig. 4, C and E) or oleate (Fig. 4D) and, to a lesser extent, in punctate structures throughout the entire cell (Fig. 4, C and D). Similarly, AP 125 (adipophilin) prominently and specifically stains lipid droplets of varying sizes (Fig. 4, C and D). Whereas small lipid droplets are usually solitary, large lipid droplets are often clustered at specific regions in the cell. Adipophilin- and TIP47-stained lipid droplets appear as rings of quite substantial but inconstant thickness, making them easy to identify (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, cells lipid-loaded with acLDL and doubly stained for TIP47 or adipophilin and for neutral lipids using BODIPY 493/503 reveal that the ring structures are indeed inside the lipid droplets because immunostaining and staining of neutral lipids colocalize; lipid droplets show a distinct ring of TIP47 (Fig. 5A)or adipophilin (Fig. 5B) staining surrounding the neutral lipid core. Cytoplasmic adipophilin is found in some cells in the form of punctate staining not associated with lipid droplets, and TIP47 shows a punctate distribution throughout the cytoplasm in some cells (data not shown). Lipid sails in macrophages cannot be identified by TIP47 or adipophilin immunofluorescence. Freeze-fracture immunogold labeling also reveals that both TIP47 and adipophilin are associated with lipid droplets. After labeling with AP 125, most adipophilin is visualized at the surface of lipid droplets (Figs. 6, 7, B and C, and 8, A and B). In addition, adipophilin is frequently found inside the lipid droplet core, where it is commonly confined to the outermost lipid layers (Figs. 7B and 8, A and B). Single labeling with GP30 and double labeling with GP30 and AP 125 reveal a similar distribution for TIP47. TIP47 is likewise present primarily at the lipid droplet surface as well as on the layers of the core near the lipid droplet surface (Figs. 7, A-C, and 8, A and B). However, both antigens are usually absent deeper in lipid droplet cores (Fig. 7, B and C). Surprisingly, the antibodies, which are directed exclusively toward the amino termini of their respective antigens, label both the concave and convex surfaces of lipid layers in the lipid droplet cores (Fig. 7, A and C). Although TIP47 and adipophilin are colocalized in lipid droplets, they are present in widely varying proportions (Fig. 8, A and B).Fig. 7TIP47 and adipophilin are components of the envelope and core of lipid droplets.A, immunogold localization of TIP47 in a concavely fractured lipid droplet.

In freeze-fractured cells, the exposed surfaces of lipid sails are characteristically smooth and featureless (Figs. 6, 9, and 10), compared with the membranes of mitochondria (Fig. 6) and the plasma membrane (Fig. 9), which contain many intramembrane particles. Immunogold labeling shows that TIP47 (Figs. 6 and 9) and adipophilin (Figs. 6 and 10) are associated with most surfaces of lipid sails (Figs. 6 and 9). However, TIP47 is conspicuously absent on some surfaces as well as in the intervening spaces (Fig. 9). Double labeling with GP30 and AP 125 indicates that TIP47 and adipophilin are colocalized in lipid sails (Fig. 10).Fig. 10Lipid sails contain TIP47 and adipophilin.

However, both antigens are present in the plasma membrane in highly specific configurations relative to lipid droplets (data not shown). We have studied the distribution of the PAT family proteins TIP47 and adipophilin in macrophages. We also provide new data on the spatial distribution of TIP47 and adipophilin in lipid droplets. We show that these lipid body proteins are not confined to the surface phospholipid monolayer of the lipid droplet envelope, as often tendered (1Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 7Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), but are an integral component of lipid droplet cores; TIP47 and adipophilin do not merely coat lipid droplets. Macrophages doubly stained with antibodies to TIP47 or adipophilin and for neutral lipids using BODIPY 493/503 reveal distinct rings of TIP47 or adipophilin staining surrounding the neutral lipid cores of lipid droplets. The subcellular structures detected by anti-TIP47 or anti-adipophilin and BODIPY 493/503 are clearly lipid droplets because the two stains colocalize. These results demonstrate un-equivocally that TIP47 and adipophilin are components of lipid droplets. The association of TIP47 with lipid droplets is not unique to macrophages because Wolins et al. (15Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) described lipid droplets in other cells including primary mouse fibroblasts, human melanocytes, human HeLa cells, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes with surface immunostaining for TIP47, an observation that we confirmed in HeLa cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). Using freeze-fracture, we found no differences in the labeling pattern and intensities of TIP47 and adipophilin between cells loaded with acLDL and cells loaded with oleic acid. In our images and those in the literature, focused adipophilin-stained lipid droplets appear in the fluorescence microscope as rings, but the staining pattern is of irregular and substantial thickness. This appearance indicates that adipophilin is indeed predominantly concentrated at the lipid droplet surface, but the fluorescence signal, and hence adipophilin, is not restricted to the phospholipid monolayer enveloping the lipid droplets. We also note that the distribution of lipid droplet proteins inside macrophage lipid droplet cores is no exception because we have found traces of TIP47 in lipid droplets of adipocytes and very substantial amounts of adipophilin, perilipin, and another lipid droplet protein, caveolin-1, not only at the surface but also completely pervading the cores of lipid droplets of adipocytes (data not shown), milk fat globules (data not shown), and lipid droplets of smooth muscle cells (23Robenek M.J. Schlattmann K. Zimmer K.-P. Plenz G. Troyer D. Robenek H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1940-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Finally, lipid droplet cores are known to contain other polar molecules such as cyclooxygenase (24Dvorak A.M. Morgan E.S. Tzizik D.M. Weller P.F. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1994; 105: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), flotillins (25Reuter A. Binkle U. Stuermer C.A. Plattner H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2092-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and caveolin-2 (26Tauchi-Sato K. Ozeki S. Houjou T. Taguchi R. Fujimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44507-44512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The finding that TIP47 and adipophilin are not merely associated with lipid droplets but are actually components of the cores of lipid droplets raises at least four difficult questions. Where do these proteins come from, how do they target to lipid droplets, how can they get into the lipid droplet core, and, in particular, how are these polar proteins packaged among the essentially hydrophobic neutral lipids in the lipid droplet core? These questions can be only incompletely addressed at the present time. First, whether TIP47 and adipophilin arise at the ER, as caveolin-1 (a lipid droplet protein we localized in ER membranes) does (22Robenek M.J. Severs N.J. Schlattmann K. Plenz G. Zimmer K.-P. Troyer D. Robenek H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Robenek M.J. Schlattmann K. Zimmer K.-P. Plenz G. Troyer D. Robenek H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1940-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is unclear. One early report describing a form of adipophilin in ER membranes from homogenates of lactating mammary gland (27Heid H.W. Schnolzer M. Keenan T.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) has not been confirmed. In the present study, we found no trace whatsoever of gold labeling for TIP47 or adipophilin on ER membranes. Diaz and Pfeffer (28Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) described TIP47 as a cytosolic protein, Brasaemle et al. (29Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a lack of sedimentable membranes containing adipophilin, and Londos et al. (1Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) discussed the synthesis of adipophilin and perilipin, another PAT protein, on free ribosomes. Synthesis of TIP47 on free ribosomes would explain the high background levels of TIP47 in the cytoplasm of macrophages and other cells (10Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32253-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence from cytoplasmic TIP47 would tend to mask the signal from TIP47 in lipid droplets, and, not being membrane-associated, cytoplasmic free-ribosomal TIP47 would go undetected by freeze-fracture immunogold labeling as we observed. All in all, it is unlikely that these proteins arise in the ER. A cytosolic origin of TIP47 and adipophilin appears more probable. Second, TIP47 and adipophilin are thought to be essentially soluble proteins, so initial binding of TIP47 and adipophilin to the lipid droplet envelope might take place via fatty acid groups, if these proteins are indeed acetylated, and once bound to lipid droplets, TIP47 and adipophilin should potentially form hairpin structures in the lipid droplet envelope (7Murphy D.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 325-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1, another lipid droplet protein, is known to be hairpin-shaped, with its hydrophilic ends directed to the cytosol. The answers to the third (how TIP47 and adipophilin could be transported through the lipid droplet envelope and gain access to the deeper lipid layers of the core) and fourth questions (how TIP47 and adipophilin could be orderly packaged among the predominantly hydrophobic neutral lipids in the core) are simply matters for conjecture at the moment. With regard to the packaging of TIP47 and adipophilin, we found labeling of these proteins on both concave and convex fractures of the core layers, i.e. on both outward- and inward-facing surfaces of the core layers. Because GP30 and AP 125 specifically recognize the amino termini of their antigens, the amino-terminals of the molecules are arranged sometimes inward and sometimes outward in the layers of the lipid droplet core. It may be possible to gain more information on the orientation of these molecules in the core using appropriate truncated proteins and antibodies raised against the carboxyl-terminals of TIP47 and adipophilin. In the context of atherogenesis, macrophages are germane for coping with superfluous lipids in the vessel wall. Shiratori et al. (30Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated lipid sails in acLDL-laden J774 macrophages treated with the ACAT inhibitor 58035. Because we now know that both TIP47 and adipophilin are present in lipid sails, lipid sails evidently represent a kind of lipid body in macrophages. These organelles are also present in native peritoneal macrophages, 2H. Robenek, S. Lorkowski, M. Schnoor, and D. Troyer, unpublished data. but to our knowledge, they are not present in other cells, so these organelles may be unique to macrophages. The smooth appearance of the surfaces of lipid sails exposed by freeze-fracturing compared with the surfaces of intracellular membranes suggests a high lipid content in lipid sails, and this supposition is in agreement with early findings of Shio et al. (31Shio H. Haley N.J. Fowler S. Lab. Investig. 1979; 41: 160-167PubMed Google Scholar). The association of lipid sails with solitary lipid droplets and the distended appearance of the lumens of lipid sails at moderate durations of lipid loading indicate that they might be sites of lipid droplet formation. Our images seem to depict budding of lipid droplets from lipid sails. The membranous appearance of lipid sails suggests they could be specialized extensions of the ER. Nevertheless, their content of TIP47 and adipophilin, which are completely lacking in the ER, and their unusual unilateral coats of glycogen make a direct relationship with the ER questionable. At the very least, it is clear that lipid sails are organelles of lipid metabolism in macrophages. TIP47 and adipophilin and other lipid droplet proteins are clearly components of both the envelope and core of lipid droplets and of macrophage lipid sails. Explaining their presence in these situations and unraveling their functions there is going to be a challenging task.

https://openalex.org/W2069145137,"Studies in Dictyostelium discoideum have established that the cycle of myosin II bipolar filament assembly and disassembly controls the temporal and spatial localization of myosin II during critical cellular processes, such as cytokinesis and cell locomotion. Myosin heavy chain kinase A (MHCK A) is a key enzyme regulating myosin II filament disassembly through myosin heavy chain phosphorylation in Dictyostelium. Under various cellular conditions, MHCK A is recruited to actin-rich cortical sites and is preferentially enriched at sites of pseudopod formation, and thus MHCK A is proposed to play a role in regulating localized disassembly of myosin II filaments in the cell. MHCK A possesses an aminoterminal coiled-coil domain that participates in the oligomerization, cellular localization, and actin binding activities of the kinase. In the current study, we show that the interaction between the coiled-coil domain of MHCK A and filamentous actin leads to an ∼40-fold increase in the initial rate of kinase catalytic activity. Actin-mediated activation of MHCK A involves increased rates of kinase autophosphorylation and requires the presence of the coiled-coil domain. Structure-function analyses revealed that the coiled-coil domain alone binds to actin filaments (apparent KD = 0.9 μm) and thus mediates the direct interaction with F-actin required for MHCK A activation. Collectively, these results indicate that MHCK A recruitment to actin-rich sites could lead to localized activation of the kinase via direct interaction with actin filaments, and thus this mode of kinase regulation may represent an important mechanism by which the cell achieves localized disassembly of myosin II filaments required for specific changes in cell shape.

Myosin II plays an important role in a wide variety of contractile events in eukaryotic cells by supporting ATP-dependent movement of actin filaments. Studies in the amoeboid protozoan Dictyostelium discoideum have revealed that complex cellular processes such as cytokinesis, cellular migration, maintenance of cell cortical tension, cell surface receptor capping, and multicellular development depend on the proper function and regulation of myosin II (1De la Roche M.A. Côté G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1525: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The diversity of these myosin-dependent processes indicates that cells must be able to undergo highly localized reorganization of their myosin II assemblies in response to signals initiating specific contractile processes (1De la Roche M.A. Côté G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1525: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Bresnick A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). For example, myosin II bipolar filaments accumulate transiently at the cleavage furrow of dividing cells where they contribute to the separation of the two daughter cells via localized contraction of actin filaments (3Moores S.L. Sabry J.H. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Robinson D.N. Girard K.D. Octtaviani E. Reichl E.M. J. Muscle Res.

In another context, myosin II filaments localize to the posterior of migrating cells where they contribute to directed cell movement by facilitating retraction of the cell rear and suppressing lateral pseudopod formation (3Moores S.L.

In Dictyostelium, as well as in mammalian non-muscle cells (2Bresnick A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), myosin II exists in a dynamic equilibrium between a cytoplasmic pool of monomers and a cytoskeleton-associated assembly of bipolar filaments (9De la Roche M.A. Smith J.L.

These phosphorylation sites were initially recognized as target sites for the enzyme myosin heavy chain kinase A (MHCK A) (17Luck-Vielmetter D. Schleicher M. Grabatin B. Wippler J. Gerisch G.

Myosin II filament assembly in Dictyostelium is regulated via MHC phosphorylation through the combined activities of at least one MHC phosphatase (19Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. Eur. J.

Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cellular and biochemical studies of MHCK A demonstrated that the activity of this kinase drives myosin filament disassembly both in vitro and in vivo by phosphorylating the regulatory threonine sites of MHC (23Coôé G.P.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MHCK A exhibits a molecular mass of 130 kDa under denaturing conditions but appears to be oligomeric under native conditions with a molecular mass of >700 kDa (23Coôé G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed studies of MHCK A catalytic activity revealed that unlike most serine/threonine protein kinases, MHCK A preferentially phosphorylates threonine residues (25Luo X. Crawley S.W. Steimle P.A. Egelhoff T.T. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17836-17843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that MHCK A autophosphorylation, which leads to a 50-fold increase in kinase activity, is stimulated not only by its substrate, myosin II, but also by acidic phospholipids (26Medley Q.G. Bagshaw W.L. Truong T. Côté G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1175: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Medley Q.G. Gariepy J. Côté G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cloning and subsequent sequence analysis of the MHCK A gene revealed a novel modular organization to the protein (28Futey L.M. Medley Q.G. Côté G.P. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 523-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of MHCK A is predicted to have significant α-helical coiled-coil structure and has been shown biochemically to mediate MHCK A oligomerization (29Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16904-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The central catalytic region of MHCK A is the prototype for a novel family of protein kinases, referred to as “α-kinases,” which do not exhibit any apparent sequence similarity to any of the conventional protein kinase families (28Futey L.M.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 460-464Google Scholar). Representatives of this kinase family have been identified in diverse groups of organisms including several kinases in Dictyostelium (9De la Roche M.A. Smith J.L. Betapudi V. Egelhoff T.T. Côté G.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 703-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Egelhoff T.T. Côté G.P. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 460-464Google Scholar), as well as others in mammalian systems that include eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinases and the Channel kinase TRPM7/ChaK1 (30Drennan D. Ryazanov A.G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 85: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At its carboxyl terminus, MHCK A possesses a domain containing a 7-fold WD repeat motif (32Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) that facilitates phosphorylation of myosin heavy chain by physically targeting MHCK A directly to myosin II filaments (33Steimle P.A. Naismith T. Licate L. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6853-6860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The studies described above established that MHCK A, which is expressed during both vegetative growth and multi-cellular development (24Kolman M.F. Futey L.M. Egelhoff T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), can drive myosin II filament disassembly in vitro and in vivo by phosphorylating specific regulatory sites in MHC. Thus, the cellular distribution of MHCK A activity is likely to have an important effect in regulating the spatial localization of myosin II during contraction-dependent processes such as cytokinesis and chemotaxis. During the aggregation stage of development, Dictyostelium cells respond to a gradient of the chemoattractant cAMP by becoming highly polarized and then forming cellular streams that move toward the source of chemoattractant (34Kessin R.H. Nature. 2003; 422: 481-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Localization studies in chemotaxing cells revealed that MHCK A is recruited to the actin-rich cell cortex upon chemoattractant stimulation and is preferentially recruited to sites of pseudopod formation at the cell anterior (35Steimle P.A. Yumura S. Côté G.P. Medley Q.G. Polyakov M.V. Leppert B. Egelhoff T.T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 708-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the translocation activity of MHCK A requires cellular actin filaments but does not depend on the presence of myosin II in the cell. In the context of cytokinesis, MHCK A is enriched at the actin-rich polar regions of the dividing cell (21Nagasaki A. Itoh G. Yumura S. Uyeda T.Q. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4333-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Liang W. Licate L. Warrick H. Spudich J. Egelhoff T. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The accumulation of MHCK A at actin-rich cell extensions, coupled with reduced levels of myosin II at such sites (9De la Roche M.A. Smith J.L. Betapudi V. Egelhoff T.T. Côté G.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 703-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Wessels D. Soll D.R. Knecht D. Loomis W.F. De Lozanne A. Spudich J. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 164-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), suggests a model in which myosin II filament assembly is prevented as a result of MHCK A recruitment to such sites. Consequently, myosin II-based cross-linking of actin filaments at regions forming cellular extensions may be relaxed; in turn, this may promote the assembly and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton necessary for the formation of pseudopodial structures (35Steimle P.A.

Insight on the structural factors contributing to the dynamic changes in MHCK A localization has come from in vivo localization studies of GFP-tagged truncations of MHCK A in live Dictyostelium cells (42Steimle P.A. Licate L. Côté G.P. Egelhoff T.T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This study revealed that the amino-terminal coiled-coil region of MHCK A is both necessary and sufficient for mediating cAMP-stimulated translocation of the kinase to the cell cortex. Accompanying experiments demonstrated that like full-length MHCK A, the coiled-coil domain alone exhibits persistent localization to both anterior and lateral cell protrusions and that cortical localization of the truncation requires the presence of an intact filamentous actin cytoskeleton. Parallel actin-binding experiments showed that although full-length MHCK A interacts with actin filaments, a truncation of the kinase lacking the coiled-coil domain was unable to associate with F-actin, suggesting that the determinants for association with F-actin reside in this domain of MHCK A (42Steimle P.A. Licate L. Côté G.P. Egelhoff T.T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In summary, previous research has established that cortical recruitment and anterior localization of MHCK A require the presence of actin filaments and are mediated by the coiled-coil domain of the kinase (35Steimle P.A. Yumura S. Côté G.P. Medley Q.G. Polyakov M.V. Leppert B. Egelhoff T.T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 708-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 42Steimle P.A. Licate L. Côté G.P. Egelhoff T.T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In vitro assays have shown that the coiled-coil domain is required for MHCK A binding to actin filaments (35Steimle P.A. Yumura S. Côté G.P. Medley Q.G. Polyakov M.V. Leppert B. Egelhoff T.T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 708-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the current study, we explore the hypothesis that the interaction between the coiled-coil domain of MHCK A and F-actin has the potential to regulate MHCK A activity, and thus may be a central factor controlling localized disassembly of myosin II filaments in the cell. Studies examining the functional consequence of the interaction between F-actin and MHCK A revealed that the catalytic activity of MHCK A is stimulated dramatically up to 40-fold in the presence of actin filaments. Further studies examining the mechanism of activation revealed that F-actin promotes MHCK A autophosphorylation, which leads to increased initial rates of kinase phosphorylation of substrate. Structure-function analyses revealed that the coiled-coil domain indeed binds to actin filaments and that this interaction is required for F-actin stimulation of MHCK A activity. Taken together, these results indicate that MHCK A localized to actin-rich sites of the cell may become activated upon interaction between the coiled-coil domain of the kinase and actin filaments, ultimately leading to the localized disassembly of myosin II filaments from such sites. Plasmid Constructs—Amino acid residue numbering in this text refers to the GenBank™ sequence entry for MHCK A (accession number P42527). For kinase assays, both full-length MHCK A and the ΔCoil-MHCK A truncation (lacking residues 1–498) were cloned into plasmids for expression in Dictyostelium cells as fusion proteins with amino-terminal His6 tags. The construction of these recombinant plasmids, as well as the purification of the overexpressed MHCK A (full-length) and ΔCoil-MHCK A proteins, has been described in detail previously (29Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16904-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In preparation for actin-binding experiments, MHCK A gene truncations encoding either the coiled-coil domain alone (GST-Coil; amino acids 1–498) or the catalytic domain alone (GST-CAT; amino acids 499–841) were cloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) for expression as fusion proteins with amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags. Preparation and cloning of the sequence encoding the catalytic domain of MHCK A have been described elsewhere (33Steimle P.A. Naismith T. Licate L. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6853-6860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cloning of the coiled-coil domain for this study involved using standard DNA manipulations and materials. Briefly, the coiled-coil domain truncation was amplified by PCR methodology using TaqDNA polymerase, in-frame primers containing BamHI sites, and the cloned full-length MHCK A gene as template (28Futey L.M. Medley Q.G. Côté G.P. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 523-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified coiled-coil domain was ligated directly into the pDrive PCR cloning vector (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA); recombinant vector (pDrive-Coil) was then introduced into Escherichia coli (DH5α) bacteria using standard transformation procedures. Bacterial clones containing pDrive-Coil recombinant plasmid were selected via ampicillin resistance and blue-white screening on LB agar plates supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin, 80 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Promega Corp.), and 50 μg/ml isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Promega Corp.). Clones forming white colonies were transferred to liquid culture (LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin; Sigma), grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm), and then harvested via centrifugation for purification of pDrive-Coil plasmid using isolation protocols provided by Qiagen. The presence of the coiled-coil domain insert was determined via BamHI restriction enzyme digest of the recombinant plasmid. The fidelity of the cloned coiled-coil domain sequence was verified by DNA sequencing (Sequencing Core Facility, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) and comparison with the known sequence of MHCK A (GenBank™ accession number U16856). The coiled-coil domain insert was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T by first digesting the pDrive-Coil plasmid (10 μg) with BamHI (30 units) for 2 h at 37 °C to excise the coiled-coil domain insert and then gel-purifying the excised fragment using the QIAEX II gel extraction protocol (Qiagen). The purified coiled-coil domain fragment was then ligated into BamHI-linearized pGEX-2T vector. E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with an aliquot of the ligation reaction, and clones containing recombinant plasmid were selected via ampicillin-resistant growth on LB-agar plates supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin (37 °C overnight incubation). Several ampicillin-resistant colonies were then transferred to liquid culture (LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin), grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm), and then harvested for plasmid isolation as described above. The presence and orientation of the coiled-coil domain fragment in the pGEX-2T vector were determined via restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing; recombinant pGEX-2T plasmid containing the coiled-coil domain fragment in the correct orientation was purified on a large scale for introduction into bacterial expression hosts. Protein Expression and Purification—Full-length MHCK A and ΔCoil-MHCK A used in kinase assays were overexpressed in Dictyostelium cells and purified to homogeneity as described previously (29Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16904-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For actin-binding experiments, GST-tagged fusion proteins containing either the coiled-coil domain (GST-Coil) or the catalytic domain (GST-CAT) of MHCK A were expressed in bacteria and then purified to homogeneity via affinity chromatography. The expression, purification, and characterization of the GST-CAT fusion protein have been described previously (33Steimle P.A. Naismith T. Licate L. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6853-6860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For the expression and purification of the GST-Coil fusion protein, E. coli cells (BL21(DE3)-Rosetta®; Novagen Corp.) were transformed with recombinant pGEX-2T vector containing the coiled-coil domain insert. The transformed bacterial cells were then grown overnight (37 °C with shaking) in 20 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (150 μg/ml). After incubation, the overnight culture was transferred to a flask containing 1 liter of LB plus ampicillin (150 μg/ml), and cells were grown to log phase (A600 ≈ 0.6) at 37 °C with shaking. At this time, the log phase culture was cooled to room temperature (∼22 °C). Cells were then induced to express GST-Coil by adding IPTG (1 mm final concentration) and then incubating for at least 3 h at room temperature with shaking. The IPTG-induced cells were then harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min); the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet frozen at -80 °C. The frozen pellet was either processed immediately for extraction of the fusion protein or stored frozen for up to a week before processing. Frozen pellets of induced cells were thawed and resuspended in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl), containing 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (PIC; Roche Diagnostics). The cell suspension was incubated with 5 mg/ml lysozyme for 15 min on ice and then sonicated by subjecting the cells to five pulses (Branson sonicator; 10 s at setting 3) with 30-s incubations on ice between each pulse to prevent sample heating. The resulting sonicate was then centrifuged for 40 min at 21,000 × g (4 °C), and the supernatant was collected for further purification of the GST-Coil fusion protein. All purification steps described here were performed at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. GST-Coil was purified to homogeneity via affinity chromatography by incubating the soluble fraction of the sonicate with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GST·Bind™ Resin; Novagen) for 1–3 h with rotation. Unbound material was removed by washing the beads with at least 5 column volumes of PBS. The bead-bound GST-Coil fusion protein was then eluted by incubating the beads with 10 mm soluble glutathione (in PBS containing PIC) for 12 h with rotation. Released GST-Coil fusion protein was collected into a single tube and then dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, in 10% glycerol. The dialyzed GST-Coil protein was analyzed by both SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody to assess the purity and stability of the eluted protein. Protein quantification involved SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue staining of samples of purified GST-Coil or GST-CAT and known amounts of pure bovine serum albumin standards and then comparing relative band intensities between these samples (33Steimle P.A. Naismith T. Licate L. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6853-6860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Actin Polymerization—In preparation for kinase assays containing filamentous actin, as well as for actin co-sedimentation experiments, lyophilized rabbit skeletal muscle actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) was resuspended in 200 μl of distilled H2O to give a 119 μm stock solution of actin in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm DTT (G-Buffer). Actin filament assembly was induced by diluting the actin stock in a final volume of 50 μl containing 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP (F-buffer); this solution of actin (50 μm) was incubated for 60 min at 25 °C to allow polymerization to occur. If necessary, the solution of polymerized actin was diluted in F-buffer to give a 100× concentration that was then added to the kinase or co-sedimentation assay mixes. Kinase Assays—Purified MHCK A and the ΔCoil truncation of MHCK A were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate a peptide substrate in the presence or absence of actin filaments by using essentially the same kinase assay described previously (27Medley Q.G.

TauNHCl has diverse cellular effects ranging from inhibiting the production of proinflammatory mediators to inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell death. We hypothesized that TauNHCl could activate a cell death pathway involving Bcl-2 members and the activation of caspase proteases. FL5.12 cells are lymphocytic cells that undergo apoptosis following interleukin-3 (IL-3) withdrawal. Therefore, cell death following TauNHCl treatment of FL5.12 cells was compared and contrasted with IL-3 withdrawal. We found that TauNHCl treatment activates a cell death pathway with kinetics very similar to IL-3 withdrawal. TauNHCl-treated cells undergo an annexin V-positive/propidium iodide-negative phase of death consistent with apoptosis. TauNHCl treatment results in a conformational change in BAX that is associated with its activation. Both Bcl-2 and, to a lesser degree, the dominant negative form of caspase-9 inhibit cell death following TauNHCl treatment. In contrast with IL-3 withdrawal, TauNHCl treatment of FL5.12 cells results in a rapid cell cycle arrest that is cell cycle phase-independent. These results demonstrate that TauNHCl treatment induces a rapid, cell cycle-independent proliferative arrest followed by the activation of a cell death pathway involving Bcl-2 family members and caspase activation.

These results demonstrate that TauNHCl treatment induces a rapid, cell cycle-independent proliferative arrest followed by the activation of a cell death pathway involving Bcl-2 family members and caspase activation. On activation, leukocytes generate large quantities of the strongly oxidizing species hypochlorous acid (HOCl). 1The abbreviations used are: HOCl, hypochlorous acid; TauNHCl, taurine monochloramine; IL, interleukin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSO, buthionine-sulfoximine; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; DiOC6, dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide; PI, propidium iodide; SR-VAD-fmk, sulforhodamine-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. Although HOCl can directly oxidize a variety of biomolecules, it is believed that the predominant reaction is the formation of chloramines with the amine groups of protein or free amino acids. Of these reactions, the predominant formation is HOCl with taurine, a sulfur-containing β-amino acid found in high concentrations in granulocytes and lymphocytes (1Fukuda K. Hirai Y. Yoshida H. Nakajima T. Usui T. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 1758-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This sulfur-containing amino acid reacts rapidly and stoichiometrically with HOCl to form taurine monochloramine (TauNHCl), a long-lived and less reactive oxidant (2Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M.

TauNHCl significantly decreases the production of many proinflammatory mediators from both adherent and non-adherent leukocytes. TauNHCl inhibits intracellular nitric-oxide synthase transcription and nitric oxide production as well as the levels of tumor necrosis factor α in RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells (6Park E. Schuller-Levis G. Quinn M.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4778-4784PubMed Google Scholar). In activated NR8383 cells, TauNHCl decreased NFκB migration into the nucleus without directly inhibiting IκB kinase (7Barua M. Liu Y. Quinn M.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2275-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Kanayama et al. (8Kanayama A. Inoue J. Sugita-Konishi Y. Shimizu M. Miyamoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24049-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) found a molecular mechanism for TauNHCl-induced inhibition of NFκB activation. TauNHCl treatment resulted in the oxidation of IκBα on Met45, preventing its degradation and dissociation from NFκB. TauNHCl also induced an apoptotic or apoptotic-like cell death, which may regulate the inflammatory response. Burkitt's lymphoma cells treated with HOCl in regular medium showed caspase-3 cleavage suggesting that an apoptotic pathway is involved (5Englert R.P. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20518-20526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the role of Bcl-2 family members in TauNHCl-induced cell death has not been examined. The Bcl-2 family contains a number of related genes that are critical regulators of apoptosis (9Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). The family can be divided into those that inhibit (Bcl-2, Bcl-x, etc.) and those that promote cell death. Those that promote apoptosis can be further characterized as multidomain members (Bax, Bak, and Bok) with more extensive homology to Bcl-2 and BH3-only family members, in which homology to Bcl-2 is limited to this single BH3 domain (10Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family appears to regulate apoptosis through its effects on mitochondria. Antiapoptotic members prevent the release of mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which are involved in caspase activation and DNA degradation, two biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis (11Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The ability of Bcl-2 to act upstream of caspases and preserve mitochondrial function may contribute to its more potent oncogenic activity relative to other antiapoptotic genes that act by the direct inhibition of caspases (12MacCarthy-Morrogh L. Mouzakiti A. Townsend P. Brimmell M. Packham G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Current evidence supports a model in which Bcl-2 prevents the formation or opening of a large mitochondrial channel that contains the proapoptotic family member Bax or Bak (13Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacCregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). Recent studies (13Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacCregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar, 14Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the BH3-only Bcl-2 family members act upstream of the multidomain member BAK or BAX to disrupt mitochondrial function and release cytochrome c. Furthermore, the main function of BCL-2 or BCL-x may be to prevent BCL-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only family members from “activating” BAX or BAK and releasing proapoptotic mitochondrial components (15Cheng E. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). The activated form of BAX can be detected using conformation-specific antibodies. No studies have investigated specifically the role of Bcl-2 family members in TauNHCl-induced death. In the present study, we examined the role of Bcl-2 family members and caspase activation in cell death following treatment with TauNHCl. Plasmid Constructs—Both the pCDNA3 and the SFFV vector (16Fuhlbrigge R.C. Fine S.M. Unanue E.R. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5649-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar) were used in FL5.12 cells. Preliminary studies indicated that the SFFV vector provided a higher expression and was used for these studies. The parental SFFV-Neo plasmid, the SFFV-HABax plasmid (17Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar), and the SFFV-Human Bcl-2 plasmid have been characterized previously (18Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. Stan Korsmeyer (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). The cDNA containing a dominant negative form of caspase-9 (Casp9DN) with a cysteine to serine mutation at the active site (19Schmitt C.A. Lowe S.W. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Scott Lowe (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). The entire cDNA for Casp9DN was cloned into pBluescript and amplified using PCR with the Pfu polymerase. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI site of the SFFV plasmid and sequenced to rule out mutations and to confirm the cysteine to serine mutation. Cell Lines and Media—Murine FL5.12 hematopoietic prolymphocytic B cells (20McKearn J.P. McCubrey J. Fagg B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7414-7418Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were maintained in FL5.12 complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 85 units/ml penicillin, 85 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 ng/ml IL-3 (Peprotech, Inc.), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. FL5.12 cells were electroporated with a Cell-Porator (Invitrogen) (300 V and 800 microfarads) in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 buffer (no fetal bovine serum) with 10 μg of plasmid DNA. Following electroporation, cells were transferred to FL5.12 complete medium and allowed to recover for 24 h. The cells were then washed and cultured with Geneticin/G418 (catalog no. 11811-031, Invitrogen) at 1 mg/ml (activity, 0.6–0.7 mg/ml) for 10–14 days. Bulk transfectants were then examined for protein expression and for sensitivity to withdrawal of IL-3. Following IL-3 withdrawal, FL5.12 cells decrease metabolism, undergo cell cycle arrest, and activate an apoptotic pathway that can be blocked by Bcl-2 family members (21Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12041-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Cells were frozen in complete media with 10% Me2SO. Cells were maintained continuously for 2–3 months without phenotypic changes. A prolonged passage of FL5.12 cells was avoided because of the expansion of a tetraploid population. Cells were discarded, and fresh cells were thawed when the tetraploid population exceeded 5% based on DNA content analysis with flow cytometry (22Van de Luke J.J. Wetering C.I. Knudson C.M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 740-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 0.1–1 million cells/ml with passaging every other day. All experiments were performed on transfected cells and included the empty SFFV plasmid (FL5-Neo) or SFFV plasmid driving the expression of human Bcl-2 (FL5-Bcl-2) and FL5-Casp9DN. The FL5-Neo cells demonstrated the same cell sensitivity to IL-3 withdrawal as non-transfected parental cells (data not shown). For IL-3 deprivation experiments, cells were pelleted (1200 × g for 7 min) and resuspended in PBS. Cells were pelleted again and resuspended in complete medium without IL-3 at 0.2–1 million cells/ml. Because TauNHCl cell killing activity was dependent on cell concentration, each cell line was resuspended at the same concentration within each experiment. Reagents—TauNHCl was freshly prepared for each experiment by the addition of 100 mm HOCl to 200 mm taurine in water. The concentration of TauNHCl was determined in each experiment by measuring the absorption at 252 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 415 m–1 cm–1. Annexin V-FITC was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog no. SC-4252). Buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) (catalog no. B2515), taurine, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (catalog no. B5002), digitonin (catalog no. D-141), and propidium iodide (PI) (catalog no. P4170) were obtained from Sigma. Anti-BrdUrd antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (catalog no. 347583). 3,3′-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) was purchased from Molecule Probes (catalog no. D273). Conformation-specific Bax antibody 6A7 was purchased from eBioscience (catalog no. 14-6997-82). ViaCount reagent (catalog no. 4000-0040) and the multicaspase detection kit were obtained from Guava Technologies. Cell Cycle Analysis—For DNA content analysis, cells were stained with Krishan propidium iodide buffer as described previously (23Cheng N.L. Janumyan Y.M. Didion L. Hofwegen VanC. Yang E. Knudson C.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3770-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, 0.2–1 million cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.2–0.5 ml of Krishan reagent prior to analysis (24Krishan A. Methods Cell Biol. 1990; 33: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The percentage of cycling cells (%S/G2/M) was determined by examining FL-2A histograms following doublet discrimination. CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) was used for both acquisition and analysis. For BrdUrd uptake experiments, cells were pulsed for 30 min with 30 μm BrdUrd and then washed to remove unincorporated BrdUrd. Cells were then cultured with or without TauNHCl treatment. At the indicated time, cells were pelleted and fixed with ice-cold 70% EtOH and stored at –20 °C prior to staining with anti-BrdUrd and PI as described previously (25Knudson C.M. Johnson G.M. Lin Y. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar). TauNHCl Preparation and Cell Treatment—Cells were pelleted and washed in sterile PBS and resuspended in media either with or without IL-3 at between 0.1 and 1 million cells/ml. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 1 mm BSO for 48 h. Cells were treated to the indicated concentration of TauNHCl by directly adding the cells to the FL5.12 complete medium. Cell Viability Assays—A Guava personal cell analyzer (Guava Technologies, Inc.) was used to assess cell viability. In brief, 10 μl of cells was added to 40 μl of Guava ViaCount reagent and allowed to stain for 5–20 min. Just prior to placing them in the instrument, the cells were diluted with 50 μl of PBS and mixed, and the data were acquired. Experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate, and the data represent the mean ± S.D. for each sample. For annexin V staining, cells were pelleted and resuspended in annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) containing annexin V-FITC (1:1000) and PI at 1 μg/ml. Cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For mitochondrial membrane staining, cells were incubated with 5 nm DiOC6 in complete medium. Cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Clonogenic Survival Assay—A clonogenic survival assay of FL5-Neo and FL5-Bcl-2 cells was performed by plating cells by limited dilution into 96-well plates. Viable cell concentration was determined in duplicate by either trypan blue counting or the use of the Guava PCA system. Cells were diluted to 2000 cells/ml and then treated with 0.2 or 0.25 mm TauNHCl for 16 h. Cells were then plated out at a limiting dilution to allow for growth of some but not all the wells. Untreated cells were diluted to 2–10 cells/ml, and 100 μl was added to each well. The number of positive wells was determined after 10–14 days of growth. The number of colony-forming units/well was corrected with Poisson statistics using the formula, colony-forming units/well = –ln(% negative wells). The clonogenic survival of untreated cells varied between 60 and 90%. For each experiment, data were normalized to the clonogenic survival of the untreated cells. As stated earlier, the TauNHCl killing activity is dependent on cell concentration, and this accounts for increased activity of TauNHCl in these experiments. Activated BAX Staining by Flow Cytometry—FL5-Neo and FL5-Bcl-2 were treated as described above with TauNHCl. Activated Bax staining was performed as described previously (26Panaretakis T. Pokrovskaja K. Shoshan M.C. Grander D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44317-44326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 28Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Molin M. Akusjarvi G. Eguchi H. Hayashi S.I. Toi M. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3684-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, 1–2 × 106 FL5.12 cells were pelleted and fixed in 0.25% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of blocking buffer (PBS with 0.01% digitonin, 5 μg/ml anti-FC, and 10% normal rat serum). The sample was split in half and stained with anti-Bax antibody (clone 6A7, eBioscience) or isotype control (clone P3, eBioscience) at 2.5 μg/sample. Cells were stained for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and then stained with 1 μg/100 μl of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (BD Biosciences catalog no. 554001) for 30 min. The cells were washed with a solution of PBS, 0.01% digitonin prior to staining for DNA content with PI and RNase as described previously (27Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Cells were acquired and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Doublets and subdiploid cells were excluded from analysis. Under all conditions, fewer than 1% of the cells stained with the isotype control were positive. Caspase Activation Assay by Guava—For the caspase activation assay, the Guava multicaspase detection kit protocol was followed. In brief, 50,000 cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 μl of apoptosis wash buffer (Guava Technologies, Inc.). 2 μl of sulforhodamine-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (SR-VAD-fmk) (Guava Technologies, Inc.) reagent was added and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. SR-VAD-fmk is a fluorochrome that covalently binds active caspases 1 and 3–9. After incubation, the samples were washed three times with apoptosis wash buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of the apoptosis wash buffer before adding 5 μl of the 7-amino-actinomycin D reagent. The samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and adjusted to 200 μl with the apoptosis wash buffer, and the data were acquired and analyzed with the Guava PCA using the Cytosoft multicaspase assay module. Cell Viability following TauNHCl Treatment—To determine the effects of TauNHCl on cell survival, control-transfected FL5.12 cells (FL5-Neo) were exposed to various concentrations of TauNHCl, and cell death was determined by dye exclusion (Guava PCA cell analysis). Following treatment, the cells underwent a time- and dose-dependent cell death (Fig. 1). The time course observed was comparable to that seen when the cells were deprived of IL-3. It is important to note that measuring cell death by dye exclusion does not distinguish between necrotic and apoptotic cell death. However, the time course we observed was consistent with an apoptotic pathway. During apoptosis, cells undergo the loss of membrane asymmetry, which exposes phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. The loss of membrane asymmetry can be detected by annexin V binding, and during apoptosis, the loss of asymmetry precedes the loss of membrane integrity. FL5.12 cells treated with TauNHCl demonstrated a time-dependent increase in annexin V staining, which preceded the loss of membrane integrity (Fig. 2). This same pattern was observed following IL-3 withdrawal (data not shown). This result suggested that TauNHCl treatment activates an apoptotic pathway.Fig. 2Annexin V staining in TauNHCl-treated Fl5-Neo cells. FL5-Neo cells were treated with 1 mm TauNHCl for the indicated times. Cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and PI and analyzed on a flow cytometer as described under “Materials and Methods.” The percentage of viable cells (annexin V-negative/PI-negative) is indicated at each time point. The arrows indicate the annexin V-positive/PI-negative cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although TauNHCl is a relatively mild oxidative agent, it is likely that its effects on cell viability are caused by its oxidative reactions with cellular components. Specifically, TauNHCl is known to react with thiols such as the tripeptide glutathione (4Peskin A.V. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 29Carr A.C. Hawkins C.L. Thomas S.R. Stocker R. Frei B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Glutathione is a prevalent antioxidant found in all cells and may be protective against TauNHCl treatment. To determine the importance of GSH in the protection from TauNHCl treatment, cells were treated with BSO, an inhibitor of the GSH synthetic pathway. BSO pretreatment alone was not toxic to FL5-Neo cells and only modestly accelerated cell death following IL-3 withdrawal. However, GSH depletion with BSO markedly sensitized FL5-Neo cells to TauNHCl-induced cell death (Fig. 3). These data showed that GSH protected cells from TauNHCl toxicity and suggested that the cell killing following TauNHCl treatment was the result of oxidative reactions. BAX Activation following TauNHCl Treatment—Following IL-3 deprivation of FL5.12 cells, BAX undergoes a conformational change that can be detected by a conformation-specific antibody (27Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Previous studies (30Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 31Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, 32Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) demonstrate that this conformational change is associated with the activation and mitochondrial localization of BAX. These events result in the release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of caspases involved in apoptosis (33Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). The conformational status of BAX following TauNHCl treatment of FL5-Neo cells was determined by intracellular staining with monoclonal antibody 6A7 followed by analysis by flow cytometry. TauNHCl induces a time-dependent conformational change in BAX in FL5-Neo cells. Untreated cells and cells treated for 4 h with TauNHCl did not stain appreciably with 6A7. However, by 24 h of TauNHCl treatment, a significant fraction of the cells stained positive with 6A7, implying a conformational change in BAX (Fig. 4, A–C). The 6A7 staining observed following TauNHCl treatment was comparable with that seen following IL-3 deprivation (Fig. 4D). TauNHCl-treated cells did not stain at any time with the isotype control antibody (data not shown). Of note, when TauNHCl was added directly to the medium 3 h prior to the addition of the FL5.12 cells, no cell killing activity was observed (data not shown). BAX is thought to translocate to the mitochondria, and this is associated with the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c (34Smaili S.S. Hsu Y.T. Sanders K.M. Russel J.T. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mitochondrial membrane potential was examined at several time points following TauNHCl treatment of FL5-Neo cells. As expected, TauNHCl induced a time-dependent increase in the percentage of FL5-Neo cells with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by DiOC6 staining (Fig. 5A). Bcl-2 Protection from TauNHCl-induced Cell Death—The conformational change in BAX in FL5.12 cells following TauNHCl treatment suggested that a mitochondrial cell death pathway was involved. Previous studies (35Murphy K.M. Ranganathan V. Farnsworth M.L. Kavallaris M. Lock R.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) demonstrate that Bcl-2 prevents the conformational change and translocation of Bax following drug-induced and Fas-induced cell death pathways (36Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl-2 prevents the oligomerization and mitochondrial localization of Bax following ATP depletion (37Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Degenhardt K. Venkatachalam M.A. White E. Saikumar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5367-5376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). If Bax mediates cell killing following TauNHCl treatment, Bcl-2 expression should suppress cell death following this treatment. Indeed, FL5-Bcl-2 cells were protected from the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death following TauNHCl treatment (Fig. 5B). Although the mechanism of Bax activation and translocation are controversial, previous studies (35Murphy K.M. Ranganathan V. Farnsworth M.L. Kavallaris M. Lock R.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 36Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 37Mikhailov V. Mikhailova M. Degenhardt K. Venkatachalam M.A. White E. Saikumar P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5367-5376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) suggest that Bcl-2 prevents the conformational change in Bax, associated with activation. TauNHCl oxidizes a methionine residue in IκBα and inhibits its degradation following tumor necrosis factor treatment (8Kanayama A. Inoue J. Sugita-Konishi Y. Shimizu M. Miyamoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24049-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the oxidation of BAX by TauNHCl leads directly to the conformational change in BAX, associated with activation. If this possibility is correct, Bcl-2 expression is unlikely to effect the conformational change in Bax following TauNHCl treatment. Therefore, the conformational state of Bax was assessed in FL5-Bcl-2 cells following treatment with TauNHCl. We found that the conformational change in BAX following TauNHCl treatment was blocked by the expression of BCL-2 (Fig. 6). In addition, no change in the migration of BAX on SDS-PAGE was observed (data not shown). These results and the absence of 6A7 antibody staining 4 h after TauNHCl treatment (Fig. 4) do not support the direct oxidation and activation of BAX by TauNHCl. Role of Caspase Activity in Cell Death following TauNHCl Treatment—Following Bax activation, mitochondria release proapoptotic factors (cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo) that can activate a proteolytic cascade involving caspases (38Cain K. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of caspase activity in TauNHCl-mediated cell death. Examination of cells using the multicaspase assay (Guava Technologies, Inc.) demonstrated that one or more caspases were activated following TauNHCl treatment (Fig. 7A). Given the involvement of Bcl-2 family members in TauNHCl-dependent cell killing, we expected caspase-9 might also have been activated following TauNHCl treatment. To determine whether caspase-9 activity contributed to the cell death of the TauNHCl-induced death of FL5-Neo cells, we generated FL5-Casp9DN cells, which overexpress the dominant negative form of caspase-9 (19Schmitt C.A. Lowe S.W. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These cells showed transient protection from cell death following IL-3 deprivation (data not shown). FL5-Casp9DN cells were protected from cell death following treatment with TauNHCl (Fig. 7B). These results demonstrate a role for caspase-9 activity in TauNHCl-induced cell death. Effect of TauNHCl on Cell Proliferation—The studies described in Fig. 1 involved measuring cell viability using the Guava PCA analyzer. Unlike flow cytometry, this instrument provides information related to cell concentration in addition to the percentage of viable cells. Despite the fact that cell death rates were similar for both IL-3 withdrawal and TauNHCl treatment (Fig. 1), the total concentration of FL5-Neo cells (live + dead) increased for the IL-3-deprived samples but not for the TauNHCl-treated samples (Fig. 8A). Similar results were found for the FL5-Bcl-2 cells (data not shown). These results suggested that, whereas IL-3-deprived cells were able to progress through the cell cycle and undergo cell division prior to cell death, TauNHCl-treated cells were not. One explanation for this result would be a cell cycle block late in the cell cycle such as in mitosis. To test this possibility, FL5-Bcl-2 cells were stained for DNA content with PI. Surprisingly, cells treated with TauNHCl had cell cycle profiles that were nearly identical to the profiles of untreated cells. As expected, IL-3-deprived cells had a reduction in the percentage of cells in S/G2/M (Fig. 8B). These results do not support a cell phase-specific arrest in cells following TauNHCl treatment. BrdUrd is a thymidine analog that is incorporated into cells in the S phase and is a useful reagent for examining cell cycle progression in a cell population. Therefore, FL5-Neo cells were pulsed with BrdUrd to label S phase cells. The cells were either left untreated or treated with TauNHCl, and progression through the cell cycle was followed using simultaneous staining with anti-BrdUrd antibodies and PI. As expected, in the untreated control samples, the BrdUrd-positive cells progressed through the S phase and entered G2/M or even G1 phase within 4–6 h of treatment. Likewise, BrdUrd-negative cells progressed into the S phase during this time period. In contrast, the TauNHCl-treated cells showed little or no change in the BrdUrd-PI profile during the time course of this experiment (Fig. 9). These data suggest that TauNHCl treatment of cells leads to an immediate cell cycle arrest that is independent of the cell cycle phase. Similar results were found for FL5-Bcl-2 cells (data not shown). Bcl-2 and Clonogenic Survival—The cell cycle arrest observed following TauNHCl treatment was not affected by Bcl-2. This suggested that Bcl-2 protection from cell death might only be transient and that the cells might not be able to proliferate following TauNHCl treatment. To determine whether Bcl-2 protected cells are able to proliferate, clonogenic survival assays were performed on FL5-Neo and FL5-Bcl-2 cells using limiting dilution in 96-well plates. FL5-Bcl-2 cells demonstrated increased clonogenic survival following TauNHCl treatment compared with FL5-Neo cells (Fig. 10). This suggested that, despite an initial cell cycle arrest, cells expressing BCL-2 retain the long-term capacity to proliferate following TauNHCl treatment. Taurine and TauNHCl have been proposed to be important modulators of the immune response. HOCl produced by neutrophils during an inflammatory immune response interacts with taurine to form TauNHCl (39Schuller-Levis G.B. Park E. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). TauNHCl has been shown to effect cellular proliferation, cytokine processing, and NFκB signaling (8Kanayama A. Inoue J.

Biophys. 2002; 401: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that TauNHCl can induce cell death. In total, previous studies demonstrate that TauNHCl may modulate the immune response during an inflammatory reaction by diverse effects on multiple cell types. FL5.12 is a lymphocytic cell line that has been used to examine apoptotic cell death pathways following IL-3 withdrawal. To better understand the direct effects of TauNHCl on lymphocyte survival, we sought to compare and contrast the cell death of FL5.12 cells following IL-3 withdrawal and TauNHCl treatment. These studies demonstrated that TauNHCl induced a cell death pathway with kinetics consistent with the activation of an apoptotic pathway. TauNHCl treatment resulted in a time-dependent conformational change in BAX that has been associated with its activation. Under these culture conditions, the cell killing activity of TauNHCl was rapid (less than 3 h). If TauNHCl was added to the medium more than 3 h prior to the addition of the cells, no cell killing activity was observed. In contrast, if TauNHCl-treated cells are washed and placed in fresh media 3 h after treatment, cell killing was retained. These results suggested that TauNHCl initiated a cell death pathway that manifested at a much later time. Based on previous results with IκB (8Kanayama A. Inoue J. Sugita-Konishi Y. Shimizu M. Miyamoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24049-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) one possibility is that TauNHCl may directly oxidize BAX, resulting in the conformational change in BAX associated with its activation. However, our studies failed to detect this conformational change in BAX at 4 h, a time point when the TauNHCl cytotoxic activity was absent from the medium. Together, these results suggested that activation of BAX by TauNHCl was indirect. Therefore, as for IL-3 deprivation and other apoptotic signals, the biochemical and/or cellular processes that resulted in the conformational change in BAX remain unknown. Cytochrome c and other factors are released from mitochondria following the activation of BAX (44Crompton M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c then interacts with APAF-1 and caspase-9 to form a complex (apoptosome) that results in the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (45Jiang X.J. Wang X.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Caspase activity then results in many of the characteristics associated with apoptosis. However, a number of studies (46Borner C. Monney L. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) suggest that caspase-independent pathways may also result in cell death. TauNHCl treatment of FL5.12 cells resulted in caspase activity, and cells expressing a dominant negative form of caspase-9 were protected from TauNHCl-induced cell death. These data support a model in which TauNHCl activates a classic apoptotic pathway that involves Bax activation and caspase-9 activity. However, cells expressing Casp9DN were not protected as effectively from TauNHCl-induced cell death as the cells expressing Bcl-2. These data suggest that caspase-independent mitochondrial pathways, such as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) or endonuclease G, may also be released from mitochondria following TauNHCl treatment. Alternatively, the expression of Casp9DN may not completely block caspase activity. TauNHCl inhibits cell proliferation of human lymphocytes following activation with phytohemagglutinin (40Park E. Jia J. Quinn M.R. Schuller-Levis G. Clin. Immunol. 2002; 102: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, these studies utilized [3H]thymidine uptake and did not determine the phase of the cell cycle in which the block occurred. In our studies, cells pulsed with BrdUrd just prior to TauNHCl treatment failed to show any cell cycle progression at 4 and 6 h. We found that TauNHCl treatment completely arrested cell division in a cell cycle-independent manner. This is in sharp contrast with the G0/G1 arrest that is observed following IL-3 withdrawal (47Nunez G. London L. Hockenbery D. Alexander M. McKearn J.P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3602-3610PubMed Google Scholar). TauNHCl arrested both FL5-Neo and FL5-Bcl-2 cells equivalently. However, FL5-Bcl-2 cells were protected at the level of clonogenic survival. Therefore, at least a subset of the cells is able to begin cycling and to progress through the multiple cellular divisions required for the detection of colonies observed with this assay. We conclude that cell cycle arrest following TauNHCl treatment is reversible. Elucidation of the pathways involved in the cell cycle independent arrest of cell proliferation by TauNHCl will be of future interest. Our studies demonstrate that TauNHCl, a compound known to be formed in abundance at sites of localized inflammation, has profound effects on the survival and proliferation of immortalized pre-B FL5.12 cells. Following TauNHCl exposure, cells rapidly underwent cell cycle arrest in a cell cycle-inde-pendent manner. After this arrest, the cells initiated an apoptotic pathway that involved a conformational change in Bax and the activation of caspases. These events could be blocked by Bcl-2 expression. We conclude that TauNHCl treatment of lymphocytic cells activates a classic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway."

Interactions of CBP with ligand binding domains (LBDs) of nuclear receptors are mediated by LXXLL motifs, as are those of p160 proteins, although the number, distribution, and precise sequences of the motifs differ. We used a large N-terminal fragment of murine CBP to map by biochemical methods and NMR spectroscopy the interaction domain of CBP with the LBDs of several nuclear receptors. We show that distinct zones of that fragment are involved in the interactions: a 20-residue segment containing the LXXLL motif (residues 61–80) is implicated in the interaction with all three domains tested (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-LBD, retinoid X receptor α-LBD, and estrogen-related receptor γ-LBD), whereas a second N-terminal well conserved block of around 25 residues centered on a consensus L40PDEL44 motif constitutes a secondary motif of interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-LBD. Sequence analysis reveals that both zones are well conserved in all vertebrate p300/CBP proteins, suggesting their functional importance. Interactions of p300/CBP coactivators with the LBDs of nuclear receptors are not limited to the canonical LXXLL motifs, involving both a longer contiguous segment around the motif and, for certain domains, an additional zone.

Promoter-bound NRs control target gene expression by recruiting diverse cofactor complexes that act on local chromatin structure in an activating or repressive manner.

The best characterized NR coactivators belong to the p160 family and interact with LBDs as well as with A/B domains of NRs. Several studies suggest that p160s play a central role in the recruitment of other coactivators, including the 300-kDa cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), which belongs to the p300/CBP family (10Kamei Y.

CBP possesses three signature sequences, designated “NR boxes,” each containing an LXXLL motif (where L is leucine and X represents any amino acid), common to most coactivators.

Both functional and structural studies now suggest a general mechanism for the assembly of NRs and coactivators and tend to limit the interactions between coactivators and NR LBDs to the binding of NR boxes on the surface of the LBD. The number of LXXLL motifs, their sequences, and the nature of adjacent amino acids vary among the coactivators and are likely to account for the observed differences in binding to selected NRs. Although p160 NR boxes are clustered in a small central region spanning ∼200 amino acids, the three LXXLL motifs of CBP are spread across its sequence (motif I: L69XXL72L73; motif II: L357XXL360L361; motif III: L2068XXL2071L2072 in murine CBP, Fig. 1A). Motif I has been shown to mediate strongly the interaction with NR LBDs (10Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Although polypeptides containing any of the three LXXLL motifs of CBP were shown to interact weakly with NR LBDs (11Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Schulman I.G. Juguilon H.

Because p160 and p300/CBP share no sequence homology and differ in the distribution of LXXLL motifs along the sequence, we wished to investigate whether these differences might reflect important differences in the mode of interaction of CBP with NR LBDs compared with p160. Moreover, because studies carried out using fragments of p160s indicate that interactions with NR LBDs are limited essentially to the LXXLL motifs, we wished to establish whether this was also true for CBP. We have used biochemical techniques and NMR spectroscopy to map the interaction of CBP fragments with a number of NR LBDs. Assignments were achieved using a 13C,15N-labeled sample, enabling changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled samples in the presence of NR LBDs to be interpreted in site-specific terms. Interactions with apo and holo forms of human PPARγ-LBD, apo and holo forms of mouse RXRα-LBD, as well as the heterodimers fully apo and fully holo PPARγ-LBD/RXRα-LBD were probed in this way. Finally, the interaction with human ERRγ-LBD in the absence and presence of the antagonist, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, was investigated. Cloning and Expression—cDNA corresponding to amino acids 228–467 of murine RXRα-LBD was cloned in pET3a and pET28b bacterial expression vectors (Novagen), allowing production of native RXRα-LBD (pET3a) and a His6-RXRα-LBD fusion protein (pET28b). cDNA corresponding to amino acids 204–478 of human PPARγ-LBD was cloned in pET28b, for expression of a His6-PPARγ-LBD fusion protein. Cloning of cDNA corresponding to amino acids 229–458 of human ERRγ-LBD was described elsewhere (36Greschik H. Wurtz J.M. Sanglier S. Bourguet W. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Mol.

Unlabeled proteins were produced individually as His6 fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21DE3 cultured at 37 °C in Lenox L Broth Base medium (Invitrogen) in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin, induced by 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 nm = 0.6 and harvested 3 h after induction. The PPARγ-LBD/RXRα-LBD heterodimer was coproduced, using cotransformation of pET28b-PPARγ-LBD and pET3a-RXRα-LBD vectors, in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. 15N-Labeled CBP1–127 and CBP31–90 were produced using M9 minimal medium with the addition of 0.6 g/liter (15NH4)2SO4 (Eurisotop). 13C,15N-Labeled CBP31–90 was produced using M9 minimal medium with the addition of 0.6 g/liter (15NH4)2SO4 and 2 g/liter 13C6-glucose (Eurisotop).

For all other proteins, cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl at pH 8.0) with a protease inhibitor mixture (leupeptin, chymostatin, pepstatin, aprotinin, antipain A, final concentration 2.5 μg/ml of each) and sonicated before ultracentrifugation (45,000 rpm, 1 h). The supernatant was loaded on a Talon cobalt affinity column (Clontech), via a Bio-Rad Biologic FPLC system. The column was washed extensively with buffer A until the UV base line returned to 0. Proteins were eluted with buffer a containing 0.5 m imidazole. With the exception of the shorter fragments of CBP (CBP1–116, CBP1–127, CBP31–90), all proteins were purified by gel filtration (GF), using an Amersham Biosciences Superdex S200(16/90) GF column, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, in 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl at pH 8.0 (for further biochemical analyses and dynamic light scattering (DLS)) or 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.9 (for NMR and DLS). In particular, the GF step allowed monomeric RXRα-LBD to be separated from the tetrameric species also present in the affinity-purified fraction. The GF step was also crucial for separating the PPARγ-LBD/RXRα-LBD heterodimer from traces of monomeric PPARγ-LBD, or tetrameric and monomeric RXRα-LBD variably present in affinity-purified fractions of various culture preparations. Analytical GF experiments were performed on an Amersham Biosciences Superdex S200(10/30) GF column (10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, flow rate 0.5 ml/min). Typically, analytical GF experiments were performed by injecting affinity-purified CBP fragments mixed with a large excess (10–20-fold) of purified holoPPARγ-LBD (see below). The mass in solution of purified species was estimated by comparing the elution volume with those of GF standard markers (Bio-Rad). Samples collected after GF were concentrated (Microcon 10, Millipore) and run on SDS-PAGE. Preparation of HoloNR LBDs—NR LBD species bound to agonist ligand were obtained by mixing diluted purified apoNR LBDs with a 2-fold molar excess of high affinity, specific ligands (tyrosine-based agonist BMS953 for PPARγ (37Henke B.R.

ERRγ-LBD bound to the antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen was prepared by mixing diluted GF-purified ERRγ-LBD with a 1.5-fold molar excess of antagonist, followed by a centrifugation step (10,000 rpm, 30 min) to remove traces of aggregates, before concentration. The purity of proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE. The quality of purified proteins was assessed by native PAGE experiments on a Phast-system (Amersham Biosciences), using 8–25% gradient gels, with a 250 mm Tris, 880 mm l-alanine buffer at pH 8.8. Mild Trypsinolysis Experiment—Affinity-purified His6-CBP1–442 (1 mg/ml) was mixed with increasing concentrations of trypsin, from 0.4 to 200 ng/ml. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and 10 μl of each was run on SDS-PAGE (12.5%) and revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. Mass Spectrometry—GF-purified CBP1–116·PPARγ-LBD·BMS953 complex was dialyzed against 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer at pH 7.0. The protein concentration was estimated to be around 1 mg/ml. ESI measurements were performed on a ESI-TOF instrument (LCT, Micromass, UK) fitted with a Z-spray source. Samples were diluted to 10 μm in 50 mm ammonium acetate and infused continuously into the ESI ion source at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. Great care was taken to ensure that noncovalent interactions preformed in solution survived the ionization/desolvation process. In particular, atmospheric pressure/vacuum interface parameters were optimized to obtain the best sensitivity and spectrum quality without affecting the noncovalent complex stability. DLS Experiments—DLS experiments were performed with a Dynapro-MS/X instrument (Proterion) and analyzed using Dynamics 5.25.44 software. Experiments were performed at temperatures between 4 and 37 °C, with proteins concentrated to around 1 mg/ml (50,000–150,000 cps), centrifuged, and filtered on 0.02-μm filters to remove dust. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Experiments—Typically, samples were 0.3 mm protein concentration in 300 or 500 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.9. For measurements in the presence of NR LBDs, 3 mm solutions of CBP fragments were diluted 10-fold into solutions containing >0.5 mm NR LBDs. NMR spectra were recorded at 500 or 600 MHz (1H frequency) on Bruker DRX500 and DRX600 spectrometers equipped with triple resonance probes with z-gradients. All spectra were recorded at 15 °C. One-dimensional 1H spectra were recorded with appropriate spectral widths for the sample, using a WATERGATE sequence (38Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3508) Google Scholar) for water suppression. Data were processed in the manufacturer's software XWINNMR (Bruker) with a 90° shifted sine bell applied prior to Fourier transformation. 1H-15N HSQC were recorded with spectral widths set to avoid folding of 15N resonances. Typically, 256 t1 increments were acquired, and quadrature was achieved using the method of States et al. (39States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). Spectra were processed applying a 90° shifted sine bell and zero-filling at least to the next power of 2 in each dimension prior to Fourier transformation. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (40Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar) and analyzed in XEASY (41Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Gu ̈ntert P. Wu ̈thrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). 15N-Edited TOCSY and NOESY were recorded with 50 increments in the indirect 15N dimension and 320 increments in the indirect 1H dimension. Quadrature was achieved using the States-TPPI method (42Marion D. Wu ̈thrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3520) Google Scholar) in both dimensions. Spectra were processed as above with linear prediction in the indirect 15N dimension. 13C experiments for assignment of backbone resonance were based on standard pulse sequences provided by the manufacturer with only minor modification. Spectra were processed as above with linear prediction in the indirect 13C dimension. Search for a Stable Complex between CBP and NR LBDs—To characterize the mode and specificity of interaction of p300/CBP coactivators with NRs, we mapped the interaction domain of CBP with various NR LBDs by biochemical methods and NMR spectroscopy. The purified N-terminal fragment of CBP encompassing the two first LXXLL motifs and the transcriptional adaptor zinc binding (TAZ1) domain (CBP1–442) revealed polydisperse behavior in DLS experiments. Moreover, this fragment was prone to aggregation and displayed high sensitivity to proteolysis. Mild trypsinolysis rapidly yielded stable degradation products (Fig. 2A), and the use of thrombin to remove the His tag resulted in cleavage at Arg217, Arg218, and Arg219 (Fig. 2B). Proteolysis also occurred during the purification process, despite the use of protease inhibitors. N-terminal sequencing of degradation products allowed identification of the proteolytic sites (Fig. 2B). The central portion of CBP1–442 is particularly susceptible to proteolysis and may therefore be less structured than either the TAZ1 domain or the N-terminal extremity encompassing the first LXXLL motif. To stabilize CBP1–442, we attempted copurification with PPARγ-LBD, which was reported to interact with CBP with high affinity (21Dowell P. Ishmael J.E. Avram D. Peterson V.J. Nevrivy D.J. Leid M. J.

CBP1–442 was mixed with an excess of PPARγ-LBD, in the presence of BMS953 (a PPARγ agonist) (37Henke B.R. Blanchard S.G. Brackeen M.F. Brown K.K. Cobb J.E. Collins J.L. Harrington Jr., W.W. Hashim M.A. Hull-Ryde E.A. Kaldor I. Kliewer S.A. Lake D.H. Leesnitzer L.M. Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Orband-Miller L.A. Miller J.F. Mook Jr., R.A. Noble S.A. Oliver Jr., W. Parks D.J. Plunket K.D. Szewczyk J.R. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 5020-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and applied on GF (Fig. 2C). PPARγ-LBD·BMS953 coeluted with CBP1–442, whereas excess PPARγ-LBD eluted later. Because PPARγ-LBD·BMS953 eluted exclusively with PPARγ-LBD when injected alone, its coelution with CBP1–442 confirms the formation of a complex. The estimated mass of CBP1–442·PPARγ-LBD·BMS953 in analytical GF experiments was 210 kDa. Because the calculated mass is 82 kDa, the complex appeared to be at least dimeric or further aggregated, suggesting that the propensity of CBP1–442 alone to aggregate is maintained in the complex. Moreover, spontaneous proteolysis of CBP1–442 still occurred after copurification with PPARγ-LBD, indicating that complex formation does not diminish the intrinsic instability of CBP1–442. We therefore focused on shorter N-terminal fragments of CBP and determined the quality of copurified CBP·PPARγ-LBD·BMS953 complexes by DLS measurements, native PAGE, and mass spectrometry experiments under native conditions. Complex formation between individually purified N-terminal CBP fragments and PPARγ-LBD·BMS953 was assessed by analytical GF. All fragments containing the first LXXLL motif copurified with PPARγ-LBD·BMS953, whereas a fragment lacking the first LXXLL motif (CBP83–425) did not (Fig. 3, A and B). Complexes involving CBP1–220 or larger fragments remained sensitive to proteolysis and showed a multimeric elution pattern in GF. In contrast, complexes involving CBP1–127 or CBP1–116 were more stable to proteolysis and displayed monodisperse behavior in DLS experiments. Native ESI-TOF mass spectrometry experiments performed at low cone tension (50 V) with copurified CBP1–116·PPARγ-LBD·BMS953 confirmed the existence of a ternary complex (Fig. 3C, species C: 47,934.85 ± 2.20 Da). Interestingly, only the apo complex was observed at higher cone tension (120 V) (species B: 47,388.9 ± 1.36 Da), suggesting that, under these conditions, the agonist is dissociated from the NR LBD, whereas the CBP fragment remains associated. This is consistent with the observation that CBP1–116·PPARγ-LBD could be copurified in the absence of any ligand (data not shown). Interestingly, purified apo- and holoCBP1–116·PPARγ-LBD complexes show different patterns of migration on native PAGE (Fig. 3D). The holo complex migrates more slowly than the apo complex, whereas apo- and holoPPARγ-LBD show similar patterns. This observation suggests further conformational changes in the CBP1–116·PPARγ-LBD complex induced by binding of BMS953. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the slightly longer construct 15N-CBP1–127 in the presence of PPARγ-LBD shows a number of significant changes from that of 15N-CBP1–127 alone (Fig. 4A). In the absence of interaction partner, the 1H NMR spectrum of CBP1–127 suggests that it is largely unstructured. There are neither upfield-shifted methyl proton resonances nor any downfield-shifted amide protons, both characteristic features of the spectrum of a folded protein. Similarly, in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-CBP1–127, all amide protons lie between 8.7 and 7.7 ppm, and there is little dispersion in the 15N dimension (Fig. 4). In contrast, in the presence of PPARγ-LBD, around 25 c"
https://openalex.org/W2030268835,"Members of the large serine resolvase family of site-specific recombinases are responsible for the movement of several mobile genetic elements; however, little is known regarding the structure or function of these proteins. TnpX is a serine recombinase that is responsible for the movement of the chloramphenicol resistance elements of the Tn<i>4451/3</i> family. We have shown that TnpX binds differentially to its transposon and target sites, suggesting that resolvase-like excision and insertion were two distinct processes. To analyze the structural and functional domains of TnpX and, more specifically, to define the domains involved in protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, we conducted limited proteolysis studies on the wild-type dimeric TnpX<sub>1–707</sub> protein and its functional truncation mutant, TnpX<sub>1–597</sub>. The results showed that TnpX was organized into three major domains: domain I (amino acids (aa) 1–170), which included the resolvase catalytic domain; domain II (aa 170–266); and domain III (aa 267–707), which contained the dimerization region and two separate regions involved in binding to the DNA target. A small polypeptide (aa 533–587) was shown to bind specifically to the TnpX binding sites providing further evidence that it was the primary DNA binding region. In addition, a previously unidentified DNA binding site was shown to be located between residues 583 and 707. Finally, the DNA binding and multerimization but not the catalytic functions of TnpX could be reconstituted by recombining separate polypeptides that contain the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. These data provide evidence that TnpX has separate catalytic, DNA binding, and multimerization domains."

Nurim lacks an N-terminal domain characteristic of other INM proteins examined to date and may represent a class of proteins that localize to the INM by a distinct mechanism. To further characterize this protein, we constructed nurim-green fluorescent protein fusions and analyzed aspects of localization, biochemistry, and membrane topology. Results from immunoprobing and protease protection assays together with other analyses indicate that nurim (total length of 262 residues) is a six transmembrane-spanning protein and contains a hairpin turn in its C-terminal transmembrane domain, resulting in the N and C termini residing on the same side of the membrane. A loop region between the fourth and fifth transmembrane domains is exposed toward the nucleoplasm and contains a region accessible for site-specific endoproteinase cleavage. In biochemical fractionation, nurim remained extremely tightly bound to nuclear fractions and was released in significant quantities only in the presence of 4 m urea. Under conditions in which nuclear lamins were completely extracted, a significant population of nurim remained resistant to solubilization. This tight binding requires the C-terminal region of the protein. DNase treatment only marginally influenced its retention characteristics in nuclei.

The outer and inner nuclear membranes are joined together at the nuclear pore complex, the center of which forms a channel controlling selective transport of molecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm (3Fahrenkrog B.

The mechanism by which transmembrane proteins are selectively recruited to the INM has been subject to considerable investigation. So far, no signal sequence, equivalent to the basic nuclear localization sequence of soluble nuclear proteins, has been found for INM proteins. It is thought that nuclear transmembrane proteins localize to the INM by a diffusion and retention mechanism (5Georgatos S.D.

After synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum and insertion into endoplasmic reticulum membranes, proteins diffuse through the membrane and around the junction of the nuclear pore complex. At the INM, these proteins appear to form selective interactions with other resident nuclear components, resulting in enrichment in the INM. A major component of the nucleus underpinning its structure and stability is the nuclear lamina (8Weber K. Nature. 1986; 320: 402Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 9Stuurman N. Heins S.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and interactions with lamina components (e.g. lamin A/C or B) are thought to represent at least one mechanism for INM protein localization (11Ellenberg J.

Yates J.R. II I Gerace L. Science. 2003; 301: 1380-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), only a few have been analyzed in any detail. The lamin B receptor (LBR) was one of the first characterized INM proteins (14Worman H.J. Evans C.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15Worman H.J. Yuan J. Blobel G. Georgatos S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It encompasses a predicted eight-transmembrane C-terminal domain together with a hydrophilic 200-residue N-terminal domain, which anchors the LBR in the INM and can transfer INM localization to other membrane proteins (17Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain has been reported to bind lamin B, DNA, and the heterochromatin protein HP1 (18Ye Q.

Although the precise relative contributions of each of these activities are unclear, it is thought that these interactions are involved in targeting and retention of the LBR to the INM and perhaps vice verse, in the case of HP1, in targeting it to the nuclear membrane (19Ye Q.

In LAP2, the N-terminal domain encompasses subregions involved in lamin B binding and in binding to chromatin (2Holmer L. Worman H.J. Cell. Mol.

Emerin has also been reported to interact with both lamins A and B (27Fairley E.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Ellis J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2571-2582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Clements L. Manilal S. Love D.R. Morris G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal domains of MAN1, emerin, and LAP2β encompasses a well conserved region of 40 residues termed the LEM domain, which has been shown to bind BAF, a chromatin-associated protein (29Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Furukawa K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise contributions of each of these binding interactions to selective association with the INM remains to be established; and for example, in LBR, selective INM recruitment was also reported for the C-terminal transmembrane-spanning region when the N-terminal domain was deleted (17Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this study, we present a further characterization of a recently identified INM protein, nurim (31Rolls M. Stein P.A. Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeown F. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Unlike the other INM proteins analyzed so far, nurim lacks a large hydrophilic N-terminal domain and contains just four or five residues upstream of its first transmembrane segment. Nurim was nevertheless observed to be tightly associated with the INM; and based on the lack of any similarity in sequence or organization to the other INM proteins, nurim was classified as a new kind of INM protein. Here, we examine INM association and the topological model of nurim in the membrane using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion derivatives of the protein in localization studies, biochemical extraction studies, and endoproteinase cleavage analysis. Consistent with earlier results, nurim is bound extraordinarily tightly to the INM, requiring detergent and 2–4 m urea for partial extraction, conditions under which other INM proteins and indeed lamin A/C were completely extracted. Additional results from immunoprobing the orientation of the termini in membrane fractions, together with consideration of the conservation of a particular C-terminal motif, indicate a revision of the organization of nurim topology in the membrane to a six-transmembrane domain (TMD) model. In addition, we present the results from analysis of sequence conservation in nurim that highlight similarities to a class of enzymes, isoprenylcysteine carboxymethyltransferases (ICMTs), indicating that nurim may possess an enzyme activity for the INM. Plasmids—To create the nurim-GFP constructs, nurim was amplified from plasmid pVLP54 (31Rolls M. Stein P.A. Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeown F. Rapoport T.A. J.

The sense (5′-GGAGGCAAGCTTGCCCCTGCACTGCTCCTGAT) and anti-sense (5′-TATAGCGGTACCTCACTCTGCCTCCCCATCCT) primers used to amplify nurim (amino acids 2–262) contained restriction sites for subsequent cloning. The PCR fragment was digested with HindIII and KpnI and inserted between the HindIII and KpnI sites of the pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) to yield plasmid pGFP-nurim. For the C-terminal GFP fusion construct, the sense (5′-GGCCGGAAGCTTACCATGGCCCCTGCACTGCTCCT) and antisense (5′-AATTAAACCGGTACCTCTGCCTCCCCATCCTGGG) primers were used, and the amplified fragment was digested with HindIII and AgeI and inserted into the similarly digested pEGFP-N1 vector to yield plasmid pNurim-GFP. The truncated variant containing residues 1–187 (pNurimΔC1-GFP) was derived from pNurim-GFP using the endogenous restriction sites SmaI and AgeI. After digestion and blunt end formation using T4 polymerase, the plasmid was religated to yield the correct in-frame deletion mutant. Plasmid phLBR1TM-GFP, coding for the LBR N-terminal domain and the first transmembrane domain fused to GFP, was kindly provided by Jan Ellenberg (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany). For ease of reference, this protein is referred to as LBR.N1-GFP in this work. For construction of the plasmid expressing emerin-GFP, emerin was amplified from a human HeLa Marathon-Ready cDNA library (Clontech) using the sense (5′-GAGCCCCTCGAGACCATGGACAACTACGCAGTCT) and antisense (5′-GTGGCGGATCCCGGAAGGGGTTGCCTTCTTCAG) primers. Amplified emerin was inserted in the XhoI and BamHI cloning sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Cells and Transfections—HeLa cells were grown on GlutaMAX I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For transfections, 2 × 105 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and transfected with 0.3 μg of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate method modified by the use of BES-buffered saline as described previously (32Greaves R. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were examined for expression and localization of the various constructs ∼24–48 h after transfection or as indicated in the figure legends. Immunolocalization—For immunolocalization studies, cells were plated and transfected on 16-mm borsilicate glass coverslips (BDH) placed in 35-mm dishes. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min, rinsed, and permeabilized as indicated in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The coverslips were then blocked in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum for 10 min and incubated for 20 min with the different primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer as follows: anti-calreticulin antibody, 1:200 (Sigma); and anti-lamin B1 antibody, 1:100 (Oncogene Science). After washing three times for 5 min in PBS, bound antibodies were detected using TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Sigma). For live cell analysis, the cells were plated in gridded glass bottom dishes so that individual cells could be located and imaged. For certain analysis of retention at the nuclear rim (see Fig. 2), cells were extracted prior to fixation. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were incubated on ice for 5 min in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 80 mm KCl, 16 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 30% glycerin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were then imaged for direct GFP fluorescence or indirect immunofluorescence as described above. Images were routinely acquired using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat ×63 oil immersion objective lens (numerical aperture of 1.4) and zoom factors ranging from 1 to 8 of the LSM 410 acquisition software. Cell Homogenization and Extraction—To isolate nuclei, cells from 60-mm dishes were washed with PBS and harvested in 1 ml of PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT. Detached cells were then transferred to an Eppendorf tube, pelleted at 800 × g for 3 min, and resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm DTT and Complete® protease inhibitor). After incubation on ice for 30 min, cells were homogenized by 25 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was then mixed with 0.4 volumes of 2.5-fold concentrated 1× extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 300 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 16 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1mm DTT) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellets were further purified by resuspension and centrifugation though a cushion of 1 volume of extraction buffer containing 0.9 m sucrose at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were then resuspended in 1 volume of extraction buffer and used directly or frozen at -70 °C. For further extraction with progressively more stringent conditions (see Fig. 5), the purified nuclei were resuspended in 250 μl of extraction buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and Complete® protease inhibitor mixture. The samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to separate the detergent-soluble and pellet fractions. The detergent-washed nuclear pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of extraction buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and Complete® protease inhibitor with or without 0.25 μg/μl DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and, for RNase treatment, with 80 μg/ml of RNase A (QIAGEN Inc.) for1hat30 °Cand pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Equal aliquots of DNase I-treated and untreated nuclei were further distributed into separate tubes containing 250 μl of buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with 250 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 m urea, 4 m urea, or 20 mm DTT. The samples were then incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Soluble supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes and precipitated using chloroform/methanol. Precipitated material from the different supernatant and pellet fractions was resuspended in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer, sonicated, and boiled for 3 min prior to separation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described below. For preparation of the cytosolic membrane fractions used in the immunoprobing assays, cells (2 × 105 cells plated in 35-mm dishes) were homogenized in 400 μl of hypotonic homogenization buffer by passage through a 21-gauge needle 30 times. Homogenates were incubated with 10 units of DNase I for 1 h at room temperature, gently homogenized again, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min. The super-natants were aliquoted into fresh tubes and incubated overnight in 1 ml of extraction buffer (containing 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with or without anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:3000; Research Diagnostics Inc.). Membrane fractions were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min and washed three times with PBS containing 280 mm sucrose. The pelleted samples were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteolytic Assay—For assays of nurim cleavage with the site-specific protease endoproteinase Lys-C (EndoLys-C), nuclear samples were incubated in 1× extraction buffer with or without 1% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated for 18 h at 5 °C with 0.25 mg/ml EndoLys-C (Roche Applied Science). The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer supplemented with Complete® protease inhibitor and immediately boiled for 5 min. After sonication, samples were fractionated on 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting as described below. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed according to standard methods. Samples were generally separated on standard 10% polyacrylamide gels or, for the analysis of EndoLys-C cleavage products, on 10–20% gradient gels (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), which were blocked by incubation in methanol according to the manufacturer's protocol and then dried for 15 min at room temperature prior to incubation with primary antibody. For immunodetection, the membranes were incubated over-night with the following primary antibodies: anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, 1:10,000 (RDI); anti-lamin A/C monoclonal antibody, 1:500 (Novacastra Laboratories Ltd.); and anti-lamin B1 monoclonal antibody, 1:500. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad), and proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL West Pico reagent (Pierce). Membranes were exposed to Fuji Super RX film for 1–45 min at room temperature. Transmembrane Prediction Analysis—Prediction of transmembrane topology within nurim was performed with several algorithms, including hydropathy plot analysis (ProtScale program) based on the method of Kyte and Doolittle (33Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar), the TMHMM Version 2.0 program (34Krogh A. von Larsson B. Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar), and the PredictProtein service PHDhtm to predict the positions and length of individual transmembrane domains (available at ca.expasy.org/tools/). Nuclear membrane proteins that have been characterized to date contain extended N- or C-terminal domains that are thought to anchor the proteins to the INM by interactions with various nuclear components, including the lamina and chromatin-associated proteins (2Holmer L. Worman H.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1741-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this work, we wished to further characterize nurim, a potentially different class of INM component, about which there has been relatively little investigation since its identification (31Rolls M. Stein P.A. Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeown F. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As seen from the protein sequence, nurim has almost no N-terminal residues prior to the first hydrophobic domain (see below) and only a short C-terminal domain of ∼30 relatively hydrophilic amino acids. The majority of nurim residues (>60%) are hydrophobic and are clustered into five distinct domains (Fig. 1a), which were predicted upon initial identification (31Rolls M. Stein P.A. Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeown F. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) to form five TMDs. The predicted organization places the N terminus in the nucleoplasm and the C terminus on the opposite side of the INM in the lumen of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1b, middle). However, the actual membrane topology of nurim at the INM, whether the N terminus is nucleoplasmic and whether the C terminus is on the same or different sides of the INM, remains unknown. Comparison of several different computerized structure predictions resulted in two additional possibilities for the membrane topology of nurim. Both predictions maintained the organization of the first four TMDs, but differed in the interpretation of the last hydrophobic segment of nurim. In one prediction (TMHMM program), the long fifth hydrophobic domain does not span the membrane (Fig. 1b, left), resulting in a four-TMD model with a long C-terminal tail in the nucleoplasm. Alternatively, the ProtScale program indicated that the comparatively long fifth hydrophobic domain is actually a bi-partite TMD, spanning the membrane twice with a hairpin turn in the middle. In this model, nurim would have a six-TMD topology, with the N and C termini on the same side of the membrane (Fig. 1b, right). Formally, in each of these models, nurim could appear in two different orientations, with the N terminus facing the luminal or nucleoplasmic side of the INM. In an attempt to further characterize nurim membrane topology and compartmentalization at the INM, we fused nurim to GFP and examined the localization by imaging and biochemical fractionation. (The examination of GFP fusion proteins appeared particularly suitable since nurim was first identified as an INM protein in a screening approach of a GFP fusion library.) We constructed three different nurim-GFP constructs (Fig. 1c). Two full-length nurim-GFP constructs (nurim-GFP, and GFP-nurim) contained GFP fused to the N- and C-terminal ends of nurim, respectively. A truncated variant of nurim was also made (nurimΔC1-GFP, residues 1–186), coding only the first four predicted TMDs, with the C-terminal end fused to GFP. Expression and Localization of Nurim-GFP—HeLa cells were transfected with equal amounts of plasmid DNA encoding each of the nurim-GFP constructs or GFP alone, and expression levels were analyzed 24 h after transfection by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1d). The fusion proteins migrated with a molecular mass (∼53 kDa) consistent with expectation (29 kDa for nurim plus 28 kDa for GFP). GFP-nurim (Fig. 1d, lane 1) was expressed in lower amounts than nurim-GFP (lane 2) and migrated with a marginally faster electrophoretic mobility. The reason for the lower expression is difficult to attribute with certainty and could be due to general considerations of the orientation of the GFP in fusion proteins in a nonspecific manner. As anticipated, nurimΔC1-GFP migrated with a decreased molecular mass of ∼47 kDa. The localization of the nurim-GFP fusion proteins was first examined by confocal microscopy using living cells. HeLa cells were transfected as described above with each of the constructs, and the subcellular distribution was analyzed at different intervals up to 7 days after transfection (Fig. 2). Efficient expression of nurim-GFP was observed; and by 4 days post-transfection, nurim-GFP fluorescence was readily detectable in many cells, frequently in patches. In most cells, nurim-GFP was observed in a compact nuclear rim pattern, whereas in cells with relative overexpression, additional localization at the endoplasmic reticulum could be observed (Fig. 2a, panel 1). Localization at the nuclear rim and endoplasmic reticulum was confirmed in co-immunolocalization studies using calreticulin and lamin B1 as marker proteins (data not shown). Nurim-GFP appeared to be quite stable and remained detectable at least up to 7 days, by which time it appeared virtually exclusively in a nuclear rim pattern. (Fig. 2a, panel 2). Similar results were obtained for the GFP-nurim construct. Deletion of the C-terminal region affected nurim localization in two ways. First, although the truncated variant nurimΔC1-GFP was observed within the nuclear envelope, it did not selectively accumulate there, mostly appearing distributed throughout the cytoplasm in a endoplasmic reticulum pattern (Fig. 2b, panel 3). Second, unlike the two intact constructs, expression of nurimΔC1-GFP was extinguished with time and was undetectable by 7 days (Fig. 2b, panel 4). Thus, although its expression levels were initially similar to those of its parental construct (Fig. 1d, lane 3; and Fig. 2b, panel 3; see also Fig. 5), the loss of nurimΔC1-GFP-expressing cells indicates either that the protein is much less stable or that its expression is not sustainable due to a toxic effect on the cells. To further examine the association of nurim-GFP with the nuclear membrane and the effect of deletion of the C-terminal region, we analyzed localization in fixed cells with or without detergent extraction. When bound to stable structures in the nucleus, INM proteins have been shown to remain resistant to extraction by non-polar detergents (31Rolls M. Stein P.A. Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeown F. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 35Gant T.M. Wilson K.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 669-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells expressing the nurim-GFP constructs were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3b) or treated with PBS as a control (Fig. 3a) prior to fixation with paraformaldehyde, and localization was examined by direct fluorescence of the GFP constructs. Typical fields are shown. For both full-length constructs (nurim-GFP and GFP-nurim), a detergent-resistant population remained detectable at the nuclear envelope, whereas the cytoplasmic fraction was almost completely extracted (Fig. 3, compare a and b). In contrast, nurimΔC1-GFP was lost from both the cytoplasmic membranes and nuclear envelope after extraction, although some punctate material that we interpreted as aggregation was sometimes observed. We note that aggregation of nurimΔC1-GFP could sometimes also be observed in live cells expressing relatively high amounts of the protein (Fig. 3a, right panel, inset). The results indicate that nurim in the cytoplasmic membranes was extracted by detergent; but once localized in the nucleus, nurim became resistant to extraction in a manner involving the C-te"
https://openalex.org/W2107301834,"Reverse transcriptase-mediated RNA displacement synthesis is required for DNA polymerization through the base-paired stem portions of secondary structures present in retroviral genomes. These regions of RNA duplex often possess single unpaired nucleotides, or “bulges,” that disrupt contiguous base pairing. By using well defined secondary structures from the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), genome, we demonstrate that removal of these bulges either by deletion or by introducing a complementary base on the opposing strand results in increased pausing at specific positions within the RNA duplex. We also show that the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein can increase synthesis through the pause sites but not as efficiently as when a bulge residue is present. Finally, we demonstrate that removing a bulge increases the proportion of strand transfer events to an acceptor template that occur prior to complete replication of a donor template secondary structure. Together our data suggest a role for bulge nucleotides in enhancing synthesis through stable secondary structures and reducing strand transfer.

Together our data suggest a role for bulge nucleotides in enhancing synthesis through stable secondary structures and reducing strand transfer. Two strand transfer reactions are required to complete reverse transcription of the retroviral genomic RNA. The first is mediated by the direct repeat R sequences located at the extreme 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome.

Subsequent degradation of the RNA template by the RNase H activity of RT frees the newly synthesized complementary DNA for base pairing to the R sequence at the 3′ end of the genome (1Haseltine W.A. Baltimore D. Baltimore D. Huang A.S. Fox F.C. ICN-UCLA Symposia on Molecular and Cellular Biology. 4. Academic Press, New York1976: 175-213Google Scholar, 2Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J.

Once this strand transfer occurs, minus sense DNA synthesis can continue. Complementary DNA sequences created when RT copies the primer-binding sequence and tRNA primer sequence mediate the second transfer event. Again RNase H hydrolyzes the RNA template base-paired to the newly synthesized DNA and frees the complementary sequences for the annealing reaction that allows plus sense DNA synthesis to continue and minus sense DNA synthesis to be completed (4Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Strand transfer reactions are also essential for retroviral recombination. It is evident that recombination is an important process for generating retroviral genomic diversity and has had a significant impact on the course of the global HIV-1 epidemic (5Thomson M.M.

This observation suggests that the “copy choice” models involving strand transfer of the nascent DNA between two RNA templates is more relevant to understanding the generation of retroviral diversity. There are several variations of the copy choice recombination model, but all are based on four factors as follows: reverse transcriptase processivity, RNase H activity (42Wu W. Blumberg B.M. Fay P.J.

Similar to the mechanism of the obligate strand transfers in reverse transcription, recombination relies on degradation of the original or “donor” RNA template by the RNase H activity to make regions of the nascent DNA behind the site of polymerization available for base pairing to a second or “acceptor” RNA template. This process is enhanced by the presence of functional NC. Once a portion of the DNA has annealed to the acceptor template, branch migration promotes complete transfer to the acceptor. In some systems, RT pausing on the donor template appears to be the driving force behind strand transfer and allows the RNase H activity to “catch up” to the nascent DNA 3′ end (44Roda R.H.

In other systems it is the presence of RNA secondary structure on the acceptor template that dictates the efficiency of strand transfer after RNase H has degraded the donor template (62Negroni M. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6385-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 64Moumen A. Polomack L. Unge T. Veron M. Buc H. Negroni M. J. Biol.

We have shown previously in vitro that HIV-1 RT primer extension reactions through duplex RNA accumulate significant levels of pause products after only limited synthesis. We further demonstrated that the presence of an unpaired nucleotide disrupting RNA base pair contiguity diminished the strength of pause sites at template positions 2 bp on either side of the bulge. The reduction in pausing resulted from a combination of increased HIV-1 RT processivity, melting of RNA duplex ahead of the DNA primer, and attenuation of branch migration (71Lanciault C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32252-32261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most secondary structures in retroviral genomes possess single or multiple nucleotide bulges in the otherwise duplex stem portions of stem-loop structures. Because some strand transfer is associated with pausing around secondary structures (26Zhuang J. Jetzt A.E. Sun G. Yu H. Klarmann G. Ron Y. Preston B.D. Dougherty J.P. J.

In this work we show that bulge residues can have a significant enhancing effect on DNA synthesis through duplex RNA portions of the HIV-1 TAR element and poly(A) signal. Removing or matching these nucleotides resulted in increased pausing at template positions within the 2-bp window described above. The presence of HIV-1 NC increased primer extension efficiency without affecting the pause pattern; however, simply re-introducing an unpaired nucleotide into the duplex returned the primer extension efficiency to levels observed for extension on the unmodified (wild type) TAR and poly(A) signal sequences. We further demonstrate that removing a bulge nucleotide in the TAR element increases the amount of strand transfer that occurs prior to complete synthesis through the secondary structure. How these results fit into the copy choice recombination models as well as the evolution of viral genomic secondary structures is discussed. Materials—Reagents were obtained as follows: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from Worthington; restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and Vent polymerase for PCR from New England Biolabs; Plasmid pGEM9Zf(–) and the T7 and SP6 RiboMax transcription kits from Promega; [γ-32P]ATP from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; Pfu DNA polymerase for site-directed mutagenesis from Stratagene; and reagents used for RNA solutions from Ambion. All DNA oligonucleotides were from either Invitrogen or Qiagen. HIV-1MN p7 from Dr. Louis Henderson (72Lam W.C. Maki A.H. Casas-Finet J.R. Erickson J.W. Kane B.P. Sowder R.C. Henderson L.E.

HIV-1MN p7 is referred to as HIV-1 NC or NC in the text. The lyophilized NC protein was dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm Zn(SO4)2, divided into 5-μl aliquots, and stored under nitrogen at 4 °C. Plasmid Constructs—pGEM9Zf(–) was digested with SacI and filled in with T4 DNA polymerase. This product was then treated with EcoRI. For cloning the WT TAR sequence, primers 5′RforBL (5′-TCTCTCTGGTTAGACCAGATCTGAG-3′) and 3′U5revECO (5′-GCGAATTCCGTCGAGAGAGCTCCTCTGG-3′) were used to PCR-amplify nucleotides 457–687 of the HIV-1 HXB2 sequence. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and then ligated into the SacI/T4 DNA polymerase/EcoRI-treated pGEM9Zf(–). Mutagenesis of this vector, using the QuickChange method (Stratagene), resulted in production of all of the modified TAR sequences and the modified poly(A) signal sequences. Primer sequences used for mutagenesis are available upon request. For construction of Lacc and G5Lacc, pGEM9Zf(–) was digested with NsiI followed by T4 DNA polymerase treatment. This product was then digested with EcoRI. The regions between primers TAROH7F (5′-TGGGGTCTCTCTGGTTAGACCAGATC-3′) and TAROHR (5′-CGAATTCCGTCGAGAGAGCTCCTCTGG-3′) on WT TAR and ▿G5 (see Fig. 1A) were PCR-amplified. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and ligated into the digested pGEM9Zf(–). For construction of Sacc and G5Sacc, WT TAR and ▿G5 plasmids were digested with SacI, and the resulting 200-bp fragment was purified after agarose gel electrophoresis (Qiagen). This fragment was then ligated into pGEM9Zf(–) previously digested with SacI. A ScaI site 40 nucleotides upstream of the TAR element sequence was then introduced into Lacc, G5Lacc, Sacc, and G5Sacc by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers Scam (5′-AACAGACGGGCACACAGTACTGAAGCACTCAAG-3′) and Scam-r (5′-CTTGAGTGCTTCAAGTACTGTGTGCCCGTCTGTT-3′). In Vitro Synthesis and Purification of RNA Substrates—All constructs were linearized with EcoRI or, in the case of Sacc, G5Sacc, Lacc, and G5Lacc, with ScaI. RNA was generated from either a T7 or Sp6 promoter using the RiboMax in vitro transcription kit. After in vitro transcription, the products were phenol/chloroform-extracted and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The RNA was collected by centrifugation, washed once with 70% ethanol, and dried. RNA pellets were dissolved in 15 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA (TE) and 45 μl of 96% formamide, 20 mm EDTA electrophoresis buffer, boiled for 3 min, and purified by denaturing PAGE. The full-length RNA was visualized by UV shadowing, excised, and eluted for at least 18 h in a 1:1 v/v mixture of TE and acidic phenol/chloroform. The mixture was centrifuged, and the aqueous phase was removed. The aqueous phase was extracted once with chloroform, and the RNA was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. The RNA precipitate was centrifuged, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and dried. The pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of TE and run through a Chromaspin diethyl pyrocarbonate H2O C-30 size-exclusion spin column (BD Biosciences). Tris, pH 8.0, and EDTA were added back to 10 and 1 mm, respectively, and the volume was brought to 50 μl. Concentration of the RNA was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. Primer Extension Assays—The following DNA oligonucleotides were used as primers: TAR-1 (5′-CACACACTACTTGAAGCACTCAAGG-3′), TARn-1 (5′-GGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGCTTAAGCAGT-3′), TAR-2 (5′-CACACAACAGACGGGCACACACTAC-3′), or PA-1 (5′-GTTACCAGAGTCACACAACAGACGGGC-3′). Each DNA primer was gel-purified and 5′-end-labeled in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP by polynucleotide kinase. The TAR element and poly(A) templates were annealed to end-labeled DNA primer in the presence of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm KCl at a 1:0.5 molar ratio by heating to 95 °C for 3 min and cooling to 37 °C at a rate of 0.02 °C/s using a Thermo-Hybaid thermocycler (Savant). DTT, MgCl2, and 7 pmol of HIV-1 RT (Worthington) were added, and the mixture was further incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Primer extensions were then started by the addition of dNTPs. Final concentrations in a total volume of 20 μl were as follows: 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm of each dNTP, 50 nm primer, 100 nm template, and 700 nm RT. At each time point, 3-μl aliquots were removed and transferred to 12 μl of 96% formamide, 20 mm EDTA. Extension products were separated by denaturing PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Gel images were scanned using a STORM PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant software. Primer Extension Assays in the Presence of HIV-1 Nucleocapsid— Reaction conditions were the same as described under “Primer Extension Assays” except for the following modifications. The primer/template ratio was 1:1 making the final template concentration 50 nm. After addition of the DTT, MgCl2, and 7 pmol of HIV-1 RT and incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, 37.5 pmol of HIV-1 NC or 75 pmol of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 5 min prior to the addition of the dNTPs. The amount of NC added was calculated to provide 100% coating of the RNA based on the assumption that one NC molecule binds 7 nucleotides of RNA (74You J.C. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16519-16527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single Round Primer Extension (“Trap”) Assay—Labeled primer and RNA template were annealed at a 1:1 ratio (final concentration 50 nm each). MgCl2, DTT, and 2.5 pmol of HIV-1 RT (final concentration 250 nm) were then added except in the case of the pre-trap in which a mixture of 200 μg of heparin and 30 pmol of an unlabeled DNA/RNA primer/template substrate was added first. Reactions were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. A mixture of the heparin, unlabeled substrate, and dNTPs was then added to each tube to start the reactions except for the pre-trap in which only dNTPs were added. Note that the sequence of the unlabeled DNA/RNA primer/template substrate was different from the labeled pair to prevent any potential strand transfer events. In Vitro Strand Transfer Assay—Reaction conditions were the same as described under “Primer Extension Assays” except for the following modifications. The primer/donor template ratio was 1:1 (final concentration 50 nm each), and after addition of the DTT, MgCl2, and 7 pmol of HIV-1 RT and incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, 37.5 pmol of HIV-1 NC was added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 5 min. In a separate tube, acceptor RNA was incubated with HIV-1 NC (100% coating) for 5 min. Nucleotides were then added to the tube containing the acceptor RNA/NC mix. This mixture was subsequently added to the reaction tube containing the donor template/HIV-1 RT mix to start the reaction. The final ratio of donor to acceptor RNA template was 1:3. Effects of Removing Single Nucleotide Bulges from the Stem of the HIV-1 TAR Element on RT Synthesis—We have demonstrated previously (71Lanciault C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32252-32261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that bulge nucleotides interrupting duplex RNA contiguity decrease pausing at template positions surrounding the bulge. The HIV-1 TAR element has a duplex stem consisting of 24 bp with single nucleotide bulges between the 4th and 5th bp and the 15th and 16th bp. There are also three consecutive bases unpaired between the 20th and 21st bp (Fig. 1A). We first wanted to determine whether removing any of these bulge nucleotides would affect primer extension of a labeled DNA through the TAR secondary structure. Five constructs were designed to compare HIV-1 RT-catalyzed DNA polymerization through the normal TAR structure (WT TAR) with modified structures in which nucleotides complementary to a bulge residue were introduced into the opposite strand of the stem to create a new base pair and thus increase base pair contiguity (Fig. 1A). Each new structure was folded, and the thermodynamic stabilities were calculated by using the algorithm of Zuker (Fig. 1A) (75Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10148) Google Scholar). RNA corresponding to each construct was transcribed in vitro and gel-purified. A DNA primer was annealed to the RNA so that extension started 25 nucleotides upstream of the beginning of the TAR stem duplex. HIV-1 RT was added to extension reactions, and accumulation of the full-length extension products was monitored over time. In all cases, an increase in pausing around the former position of the bulge was observed (Fig. 1B). The ▿U16 modification resulted in a small increase in pausing at template position +14 (where +1 is the first template base within the duplex region of the TAR stem), and matching the unpaired triplet further up the stem with ▿U16/▿AGA22-24 showed a small increase in pausing at +24 (Fig. 1B, lanes 9–12 and 13–16, respectively). It should be noted that in the former case, increased pausing at +14 is within the 2-bp window in which a bulge residue affects pausing (71Lanciault C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32252-32261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This also holds true in the latter case since +24 in the modified structure co"

Homozygous knockout clones showed an increased cellular proliferation along with an increase in S and a decrease in G2/M phase populations. Interestingly, ES p12(CDK2-AP1) knockout clones showed a resistance to cisplatin treatment along with an increased DNA repair activity assessed by host cell reactivation assay using a cisplatin-damaged reporter DNA and a significant reduction of apoptosis upon cisplatin treatment. By using stable p12(CDK2-AP1) short interfering RNA (siRNA) clones from human normal oral keratinocytes, we confirmed that downregulation of p12(CDK2-AP1) resulted in a resistance to cisplatin. More interestingly, cisplatin treatment resulted in a reduction of CDK2 kinase activity in control clones, but p12(CDK2-AP1) knockout clones showed a sustained CDK2 kinase activity. These data suggest that p12(CDK2-AP1) plays a role in cisplatin-mediated cellular responses by modulating CDK2 activity. These data further suggest p12(CDK2-AP1) is a potential gene therapeutic agent for oral/head and neck cancer in conjunction with DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin."

Current data suggest that p73 can bind to a number of p53-regulated promoters, because all p73 variants contain DNA binding and oligomerization domains that share homology with p53 (2Melino G.

TA-p73, similar to p53, can also up-regulate BAX, which collaborates with PUMA to trigger cytochrome c release from mitochondria (16Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X.

Other pro-apoptotic genes up-regulated by TA-p73 include p53AIP1, NOXA, IGF-BP3, and PERP, which are also activated by p53 (16Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X.

In addition, a set of genes regulated by p73, but not p53, has also been identified (16Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fontemaggi G. Kela I.

The ΔN-p73 variants that lack a TA domain antagonize TA-p73 by blocking the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. Survival of sympathetic neurons depends on the expression of ΔN-p73, which is maintained by nerve growth factor (20Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The p73-/- mice lacking all p73 splice variants have half as many cortical neurons as their wild type littermates (21Pozniak C.D. Barnabe-Heider F. Rymar V.V. Lee A.F. Sadikot A.F. Miller F.D. J.

Lee A.F. Sadikot A.F. Miller F.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9800-9809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ΔN-p73 promoter can be up-regulated by either TA-p73 or p53 in a negative feedback loop to mitigate the apoptotic function of TA-p73 and p53 (22Grob T.J. Novak U. Maisse C. Barcaroli D.

Taken together, the N-terminal variants of p73 have opposing activities in the regulation of cell death. The TRP73 gene function is not limited to apoptosis. Evidence has accumulated to suggest an involvement of p73 in differentiation. Mice deficient for p73 display pleiotropic phenotypes including hippocampal dysgenesis, hydrocephalus, chronic nasal inflammation, and defective pheromone sensing (23Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R.

Ectopic expression of TA-p73 proteins promotes differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in the absence of retinoic acid (24De Laurenzi V. Raschella G. Barcaroli D. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M.

With explanted neuronal precursor cells, ectopic expression of TA-p73α facilitated differentiation toward neuronal myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in response to thyroid hormone, retinoic acid, or the withdrawal of platelet-derived growth factor (25Billon N. Terrinoni A. Jolicoeur C. McCarthy A. Richardson W.D. Melino G. Raff M. Development. 2004; 131: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the same experimental system, expression of ΔN-p73α severely restrained differentiation (25Billon N. Terrinoni A. Jolicoeur C. McCarthy A. Richardson W.D. Melino G. Raff M.

Cultured neuronal or hematopoietic progenitor cells do not express p73 until the onset of differentiation (24De Laurenzi V. Raschella G. Barcaroli D. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Ranalli M.

During zebra fish development, TA-p73 is the predominant isoform and its expression is restricted to subsets of cells in olfactory system, telencephalon, dorsal diencephalon, and pronephric ducts (27Rentzsch F. Kramer C. Hammerschmidt M. Gene. 2003; 323: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The TA-p73α expression is also detected in differentiating slow muscle cells of somites and pharyngeal endoderm (27Rentzsch F. Kramer C. Hammerschmidt M. Gene. 2003; 323: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that p73 may participate in the regulation of development. A previous study has found that TRP73 gene expression is suppressed in C2C12 myoblasts (28Fontemaggi G. Gurtner A. Strano S. Higashi Y. Sacchi A. Piaggio G. Blandino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8461-8470Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To determine whether this suppression of p73 is relevant to the differentiating potential of C2C12 cells, we examined the consequence of ectopically expressing p73 on myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. The two major splice variants of TA-p73, p73α and p73β, were expressed transiently or stably in C2C12 myoblasts, and their effects on differentiation were examined. We found that p73α, but not p73β, suppressed myogenic differentiation, but both isoforms promoted apoptotic response of C2C12 cells to genotoxic stress. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Plasmid Constructs—Murine C2C12 myoblasts were purchased from ATCC and routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 20% fetal bovine serum. For myogenic differentiation, the cells were changed into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum and 50 ng/ml IGF-1 (Sigma). A monoclonal anti-HA antibody was purchased from BABCO. Anti-MHC antibody was procured from Sigma. Anti-MyoD, anti-myogenin, anti-p21Cip1, and anti-caspase 3 antibodies all were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human p73 cDNAs were from Dr. Gerry Melino of University of Rome, Italy. Human p73α and p73β were HA-tagged at the N terminus in pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Murine MyoD cDNA was cloned in pCMV vector. Gal4-MyoD, p4RE-Luc, and pGal-Luc plasmids (29Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar, 30Puri P.L. Bhakta K. Wood L.D. Costanzo A. Zhu J. Wang J.Y. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were from Dr. Lorenzo Puri at the Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA and the Telethon Dulbecco Institute, Italy. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Luciferase activity was measured with Promega's dual luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence Staining—Transfected cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X/PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The coverslips were blocked with 10% goat serum in 0.1% Triton X/PBS for 30 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were sequentially incubated with the cells in 0.1% Triton X/PBS for 1 h. Coverslips were finally washed with 0.1% Triton X/PBS, mounted on slides, and examined under an Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss). Images were captured and analyzed with ImagePro-PLUS (Media Cybernetics). Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 4 software. Gene Expression Profiling with Affymetrix DNA Microarrays—Affymetrix GeneChip mouse oligonucleotide arrays (MG_U74AV2) were employed to profile gene expression associated with myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Total RNAs were isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) from C2C12 cells stably expressing p73α or p73β cultured in differentiation media for 24 h, as well as from vector-mocked C2C12 cells cultured in regular growth media. Total RNA preparations were further purified with RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Double-stranded cDNAs were made with a T7 promoter-oligo(dT) primer priming the synthesis of the first strand. Biotinylated cRNA probes were synthesized off double-stranded cDNA as template with an in vitro transcription kit involving T7 RNA polymerase and biotin-dUTP. The labeled cRNA was fragmented to 35–200 base fragments by metal-induced hydrolysis in a fragmentation buffer containing Tris acetate, pH 8.1, potassium acetate, and magnesium acetate. About 50 μg of fragmented cRNA probe was used to hybridize an Affymetrix GeneChip at 45 °C in a GeneChip hybridization oven. Staining was done in a three-step procedure starting with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin staining solution, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-streptavidin, and finally a second staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Stained arrays were scanned with a GeneArray scanner from Affymetrix. Analyses of data were performed using the Affymetrix software microarray suite Gene-Spring from Silicon Genetics and various freeware analysis packages such as D-Chip, Cluster, and Treeview. Cell Death Assay—C2C12 myoblasts stably expressing p73α or p73β were treated with 25 μm cisplatin (CCDP) for 24 h. Thereafter, death of these cells was measured by trypan blue exclusion. Lysates of these cells were examined with an antibody recognizing either pro-caspase 3 or cleaved caspase 3 on Western blots. Inhibition of Myogenic Differentiation by Transiently Expressed p73α, but Not p73β—To examine the effect of p73 on myogenic differentiation, p73α, ΔN-p73α, or p73β was transiently expressed along with green fluorescence protein (GFP) in C2C12 myoblasts. GFP served as an indicator for transfected cells. After 24 h of transfection, the cultures were shifted into differentiation media (DM) to allow the activation of MyoD and the onset of myogenic differentiation (29Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D.

Genet. 2002; 32: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). After 48 h in DM, the cultures were examined by immunofluorescence staining for MHC (myosin heavy chain), a muscle differentiation marker (Fig. 1A) (29Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar, 30Puri P.L. Bhakta K. Wood L.D. Costanzo A. Zhu J. Wang J.Y. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The percentages of MHC-positive cells among the GFP-positive population were scored (Fig. 1, A and B). Ectopic expression of p73α reduced the incidence of MHC-positive cells by ∼30-fold as compared with cells expressing GFP alone. Similar levels of suppressive effect could be achieved with the ectopic expression of ΔN-p73α (Fig. 1, A and B). By contrast, ectopic expression of p73β had no detectable effect on the extent of myogenic differentiation (Fig. 1B). Suppression of MyoD Transactivation by p73α, but Not p73β—The transcription factor MyoD, a master regulator of myogenesis, is constitutively expressed in C2C12 myoblasts and drives the expression of muscle-specific genes during myogenic differentiation (31Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 32Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 33Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The significant inhibition by p73α of myogenic differentiation prompted us to examine whether p73α affected MyoD activity. A luciferase reporter construct containing four MyoD binding sites (4RE) (29Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar, 30Puri P.L. Bhakta K. Wood L.D. Costanzo A. Zhu J. Wang J.Y. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was transfected either alone or with p53, p73α, ΔN-p73α, or p73β into C2C12 myoblasts. Luciferase activity was measured at 48 h after shifting the transfected cultures into DM. Consistent with the inhibition of differentiation (Fig. 1A), p73α suppressed MyoD-dependent transcription by as much as 90% (Fig. 1C). ΔN-p73α was equally effective at suppressing MyoD transactivation (Fig. 1C). By comparison, p73β or p53 was far less potent at attenuating MyoD activity (Fig. 1C). To determine whether p73α directly interferes with the transactivation function of MyoD, we examined its effect on GAL4-MyoD. GAL4-MyoD is a fusion of MyoD and the Gal4 DNA binding domain (29Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar, 30Puri P.L. Bhakta K. Wood L.D. Costanzo A. Zhu J. Wang J.Y. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By using a luciferase reporter downstream of five GAL4-binding sites in tandem, it was possible to measure the transactivating function of the GAL4-MyoD fusion protein (29Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar, 30Puri P.L. Bhakta K. Wood L.D. Costanzo A. Zhu J. Wang J.Y. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Unlike the 4RE-Luc, co-expression of p73α or ΔN-p73 with GAL4-MyoD had negligible effect on the expression of luciferase. Again, p73β or p53 did not affect the expression of GAL-Luc when coexpressed with GAL4-MyoD (Fig. 1D). These observations suggested that p73α might interfere with the interaction of MyoD with the 4RE promoter, but it did not directly inhibit the transactivating function of MyoD. Substantial Delay in the Differentiation of C2C12 Myoblasts Stably Expressing p73α—To corroborate the conclusions drawn from transient transfection experiments, HA-tagged p73α or p73β was stably expressed in C2C12 myoblasts through retroviral-mediated gene transduction. We were unable to maintain the stable expression of ΔN-p73α in C2C12 myoblasts; hence, its effect was not further examined. Immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody confirmed stable expression and subcellular localization of both proteins (Fig. 2A). Both p73α and p73β localized to the nuclei of C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 2B). The cells were then placed in DM and myogenic differentiation assessed by immunofluorescence staining for MHC at days 3 and 5 (Fig. 2C). p73α-expressing C2C12 cells differentiated substantially less than either vector-mocked or p73β-expressing cells at both time points (Fig. 2C). The percentages of nuclei in MHC-positive multinucleate cells relative to those of total cell population were enumerated (Fig. 2D). C2C12 myoblasts stably expressing p73α were reduced almost by half in their potential for myogenic differentiation as compared with vector-mocked C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 2D). The stable expression of p73β, on the other hand, had no apparent effect on the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 2D). Results from stable cell line systems further supported that p73α is distinct from p73β in its ability to suppress myogenic differentiation. Delay by p73α in the Expression of Muscle Differentiation Markers—Transcription cascades activated by MyoD initiate and maintain the expression of an array of muscle-specific genes (31Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 32Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 33Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because p73α interfered with MyoD function in transient transfection experiments (Fig. 1), we wanted to ascertain whether the stable expression of p73α would compromise MyoD function in C2C12 myoblasts. C2C12 myoblasts stably expressing p73α or p73β were cultured in DM for 6 days to allow myogenesis. At 1-day intervals the cells were harvested and processed for immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize MHC, myogenin, MyoD, and p21Cip1 (Fig. 3A). The up-regulation of MHC, myogenin, and p21Cip1 has been shown to be dependent upon the activity of MyoD (34Wheeler M.T. Snyder E.C. Patterson M.N. Swoap S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1069-C1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Thompson W.R. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In p73α-expressing cells, the MHC level was much lower than vector-transfected myoblasts on days 3 and 4 into myogenic differentiation (Fig. 3A). MHC expression in p73α-expressing cells became detectable on days 5 and 6, indicating a considerable lag in muscle gene expression. The suppression of myogenin expression in p73α-expressing cells was evident on day 1 into myogenic differentiation. This suppression persisted through day 4 and languished thereafter. The induction of p21Cip1 was detected in vector or p73β-expressing myoblasts on day 3 into differentiation, but not in p73α-expressing cells. These results suggested that p73α delayed the expression of MyoD-driven gene expression in C2C12 cells. On the other hand, p73β had little effect on the expression of these muscle differentiation markers throughout the experimental time course (Fig. 3A). Investigation of gene expression through immunoblotting is limited in scope by the availability of specific antibodies. We therefore used mouse oligonucleotide microarrays (MG_U74AV2; Affymetrix) to examine the effect of p73α or p73β on gene expression during C2C12 differentiation. p73α- or p73β-expressing C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in DM for 1 day prior to being subject to gene profiling with Affymetrix mouse DNA microarrays. The expression profile of C2C12 myoblasts cultured in regular growth media (GM) was also examined (Fig. 3B). Comparison of the expression profiles of a cohort of muscle-specific genes revealed their up-regulation in p73β-expressing cells, but not in p73α-expressing cells cultured in DM (Fig. 3B). With the hybridization values in GM-cultured cells set at 1, the levels of expression of this cohort of muscle-specific genes in DM-cultured cells were evaluated as -fold increase over the baseline (Fig. 3B). These genes can be categorized into three groups according to the development of cardiac/skeletal muscles, namely actin, myosin, and troponin. E boxes have been identified in promoters of cardiac/skeletal actin genes to mediate direct or indirect activation by MyoD (38Liu T. Wu J. He F. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 39Marsh D.R. Carson J.A. Stewart L.N. Booth F.W. J. Muscle Res.

The same holds true of cardiac/skeletal genes of myosin light/heavy chains and troponins (41Asakura A. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Komiya T. Nabeshima Y. Mol. Cell.

The gene profiling results were therefore consistent with the conclusion that MyoD activity was compromised by the ectopic expression of p73α in C2C12 cells. Comparable Stimulation of Apoptosis by p73α and p73β in Cisplatin-treated C2C12 Cells—In cultured human cell lines, p73 is activated by DNA damage to promote apoptosis (7Gong J.G. Costanzo A.

Cancer Cells. 2003; 3: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Recently, p73 was shown to also promote tumor necrosis factor α-induced cell death (12Chau B.N. Chen T.T. Wan Y.Y. DeGregori J. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4438-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When cultured in differentiation media, C2C12 cells undergo myogenic differentiation and cell death because of the withdrawal of fetal bovine serum. Stable expression of p73α or p73β exacerbated cell death of C2C12 from serum deprivation (data not shown). Addition of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) to the differentiation media suppresses death without compromising differentiation. The suppression of myogenic differentiation by p73α was observed in the presence of IGF-1 (Figs. 2 and 3). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of p73α on myogenic differentiation is related to its pro-apoptotic activity, we compared the efficiencies of p73α and p73β at sensitizing C2C12 cells to death induced by genotoxic stress. C2C12 myoblasts stably expressing p73α or p73β were treated with 25 μm cisplatin (CDDP, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) for induction of apoptosis by DNA damage. By comparison with vector-expressing myoblasts, both p73α and p73β caused a higher level of cell death at 24 and 48 h of cisplatin treatment (40–50% in cell death versus <10% of vector-controlled myoblasts at 24 h) (Fig. 4A). The attendant proteolytic cleavage of pro-caspase 3 provided for a biochemical measurement of apoptosis, and this event was stimulated by the stable expression of either p73α or p73β in C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 4B). p73α and p73β were equally effective at mediating DNA damage-induced death of myoblasts (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, the ability of p73α to suppress myogenic differentiation reflects functions other than its pro-apoptotic activity. In this study, a biological distinction was made between p73α and its splice variant p73β. p73α can suppress myogenic differentiation, whereas p73β does not have the same effect in C2C12 myoblasts. The distinction arose from the unique ability of p73α to attenuate MyoD activity, on which the myogenic differentiation program depends to regulate the expression of genes required for muscle formation. Both p73α and p73β, however, sensitized myoblasts to cisplatin-induced cell death. A previous study found that p73 gene expression is proactively suppressed in C2C12 myoblasts by a zinc finger homeo-domain transcriptional repressor, ZEB (28Fontemaggi G. Gurtner A. Strano S. Higashi Y. Sacchi A. Piaggio G. Blandino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8461-8470Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This suppression ends shortly after the onset of myogenic differentiation to allow p73 expression (28Fontemaggi G. Gurtner A. Strano S. Higashi Y. Sacchi A. Piaggio G. Blandino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8461-8470Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It was unclear whether p73 expression contributed to the process of myogenic differentiation. Results from this study suggest that expression of p73 in myoblasts would be detrimental to myogenesis as p73α can substantially delay the onset of myogenic differentiation. Myoblasts may therefore selectively repress p73 expression to avoid the inhibitory effect of p73α. A suppression of p73 expression until after the onset of differentiation was also observed in promyeloblasts, teratocarcinoma, and neuroblastoma (24De Laurenzi V. Raschella G. Barcaroli D.

Gene. 2003; 323: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Regulating p73 expression could be a means of controlling differentiation. For instance, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) can up-regulate p73 through the activation of ABL (12Chau B.N. Chen T.T. Wan Y.Y. DeGregori J. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4438-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or ASK1 kinases (45Dasgupta P. Betts V. Rastogi S. Joshi B. Morris M. Brennan B. Ordonez-Ercan D. Chellappan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38762-38769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, TNFα has also been shown to interfere with myogenic differentiation (46Miller S.C. Ito H. Blau H.M. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2295-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 47Szalay K. Razga Z. Duda E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 391-398PubMed Google Scholar, 48Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of p73α could, in part, mediate this inhibitory effect of TNFα. Defects in terminal differentiation are a hallmark of cancer cells. Despite the initial hypothesis that p73 is a tumor suppressor, the human TRP73 gene is rarely mutated in sporadic cancers (2Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 4Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Wang J.Y. Melino G. J.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In fact, p73 is found frequently overexpressed in human breast, bladder, liver, colon, and thyroid cancers, with p73α being its predominant form (50Guan M. Peng H.X. Yu B. Lu Y. Jpn. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 33: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 51Davis B.B. Dong Y. Weiss R.H. Am. J. Physiol.

We also detected elevated p73α expression in rhabdomyosarcoma (data not shown). These cancers could exploit p73α to suppress differentiation in aid of their malignant transformation. Other mechanisms, such as nuclear exclusion of ABL tyrosine kinase (55Vella V. Zhu J. Frasca F. Li C.Y. Vigneri P. Vigneri R. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25151-25157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), may be simultaneously enacted to undercut pro-apoptotic activity associated with p73 up-regulation in human cancers. Beyond its involvement in apoptosis, future characterization of p73 physiological functions will rely on the identification of factors that interact with different p73 variants in a cell context-dependent manner to regulate differentiation and possibly other biological processes. Human p73 cDNAs were a generous gift from Dr. Gerry Melino at University of Rome. We thank Vera Huang for critical reading of the manuscript."
