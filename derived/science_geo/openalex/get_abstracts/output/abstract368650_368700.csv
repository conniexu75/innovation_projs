https://openalex.org/W1998599366,Massively parallel pyrosequencing of amplicons from the V6 hypervariable regions of small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes is commonly used to assess diversity and richness in bacterial and archaeal populations. Recent advances in pyrosequencing technology provide read lengths of up to 240 nucleotides. Amplicon pyrosequencing can now be applied to longer variable regions of the SSU rRNA gene including the V9 region in eukaryotes.We present a protocol for the amplicon pyrosequencing of V9 regions for eukaryotic environmental samples for biodiversity inventories and species richness estimation. The International Census of Marine Microbes (ICoMM) and the Microbial Inventory Research Across Diverse Aquatic Long Term Ecological Research Sites (MIRADA-LTERs) projects are already employing this protocol for tag sequencing of eukaryotic samples in a wide diversity of both marine and freshwater environments.Massively parallel pyrosequencing of eukaryotic V9 hypervariable regions of SSU rRNA genes provides a means of estimating species richness from deeply-sampled populations and for discovering novel species from the environment.
https://openalex.org/W1986761262,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, highly conserved, non-coding RNA that alter protein expression and regulate multiple intracellular processes, including those involved in the response to cellular stress. Alterations in miRNA expression may occur following exposure to several stress-inducing anticancer agents including ionizing radiation, etoposide, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Methodology/Principal Findings Normal human fibroblasts were exposed to radiation, H2O2, or etoposide at doses determined by clonogenic cell survival curves. Total RNA was extracted and miRNA expression was determined by microarray. Time course and radiation dose responses were determined using RT-PCR for individual miRNA species. Changes in miRNA expression were observed for 17 miRNA species following exposure to radiation, 23 after H2O2 treatment, and 45 after etoposide treatment. Substantial overlap between the miRNA expression changes between agents was observed suggesting a signature miRNA response to cell stress. Changes in the expression of selected miRNA species varied in response to radiation dose and time. Finally, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased with increasing doses of radiation and pre-treatment with the thiol antioxidant cysteine decreased both ROS production and the miRNA response to radiation. Conclusions These results demonstrate a common miRNA expression signature in response to exogenous genotoxic agents including radiation, H2O2, and etoposide. Additionally, pre-treatment with cysteine prevented radiation-induced alterations in miRNA expression which suggests that miRNAs are responsive to oxidative stress. Taken together, these results imply that miRNAs play a role in cellular defense against exogenous stress and are involved in the generalized cellular response to genotoxic oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2025879648,"Dysregulation of Axl and its ligand growth arrest-specific 6 is implicated in the pathogenesis of several human cancers. In this study, we have used RNAi and monoclonal antibodies to assess further the oncogenic potential of Axl. Here we show that Axl knockdown reduces growth of lung and breast cancer xenograft tumors. Inhibition of Axl expression attenuates breast cancer cell migration and inhibits metastasis to the lung in an orthotopic model, providing the first in vivo evidence that links Axl directly to cancer metastasis. Axl knockdown in endothelial cells impaired tube formation and this effect was additive with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Further analysis demonstrated that Axl regulates endothelial cell functions by modulation of signaling through angiopoietin/Tie2 and Dickkopf (DKK3) pathways. We have developed and characterized Axl monoclonal antibodies that attenuate non-small cell lung carcinoma xenograft growth by downregulation of receptor expression, reducing tumor cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that Axl plays multiple roles in tumorigenesis and that therapeutic antibodies against Axl may block Axl functions not only in malignant tumor cells but also in the tumor stroma. The additive effect of Axl inhibition with anti-VEGF suggests that blocking Axl function could be an effective approach for enhancing antiangiogenic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2051432136,"Sonic hedgehog (SHH) expression is tightly regulated throughout development. In the adult, aberrant expression of SHH is associated with the onset and progression of pancreatic cancer, as evidenced by increased levels of expression in premalignant and malignant lesions of the pancreas. We investigated the hypothesis that SHH, secreted from pancreatic tumors, functions in a paracrine manner to influence the biological condition of mesenchymal and endothelial cells. Orthotopic implantation of a pancreatic tumor cell line expressing SHH (Capan-2) and a transformed primary cell line that overexpresses SHH (T-HPNE.SHH) were used to show that overexpression of SHH increased primary tumor size and metastasis. Treatment with a neutralizing antibody, 5E1, decreased primary tumor volume and inhibited metastasis. Lyve-1+ vessels and stromal fibroblasts in tumors expressed primary cilium and showed localization of the receptor Smoothened to the primary cilium, providing evidence of active SHH signaling through this pathway. Although primary cilia are present on normal ductal cells of the pancreas, we did not observe primary cilium on the ductal tumor cells, suggesting decreased autocrine signaling through pathways mediated by the primary cilium in pancreatic cancer. These data support the hypothesis that SHH, secreted from pancreatic epithelia, is critical in establishing and regulating the tumor microenvironment and thereby contributes to progression of pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1989660004,"Elevated levels of plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, leading to familial hypercholesterolemia, are enhanced by mutations in at least three major genes, the LDL receptor (LDLR), its ligand apolipoprotein B, and the proprotein convertase PCSK9. Single point mutations in PCSK9 are associated with either hyper- or hypocholesterolemia. Accordingly, PCSK9 is an attractive target for treatment of dyslipidemia. PCSK9 binds the epidermal growth factor domain A (EGF-A) of the LDLR and directs it to endosomes/lysosomes for destruction. Although the mechanism by which PCSK9 regulates LDLR degradation is not fully resolved, it seems to involve both intracellular and extracellular pathways. Here, we show that clathrin light chain small interfering RNAs that block intracellular trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes rapidly increased LDLR levels within HepG2 cells in a PCSK9-dependent fashion without affecting the ability of exogenous PCSK9 to enhance LDLR degradation. In contrast, blocking the extracellular LDLR endocytosis/degradation pathway by a 4-, 6-, or 24-h incubation of cells with Dynasore or an EGF-AB peptide or by knockdown of endogenous autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia did not significantly affect LDLR levels. The present data from HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes favor a model whereby depending on the dose and/or incubation period, endogenous PCSK9 enhances the degradation of the LDLR both extra- and intracellularly. Therefore, targeting either pathway, or both, would be an effective method to reduce PCSK9 activity in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease.

It was shown that the adaptor protein ARH, which interacts with the cytosolic tail of the LDLR, is essential for the endocytosis and degradation of the cell surface PCSK9·LDLR complex in vivo (16Lagace T.A.

However, hepatic LDLR protein levels were also reduced upon overexpression of PCSK9 in Arh −/− mice (9Park S.W. Moon Y.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50630-50638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of an ARH-independent intracellular pathway. Intriguingly, at endogenous levels of PCSK9, the absence of ARH did not affect hepatic LDLR subcellular localization in LE/L or protein levels (17Jones C. Hammer R.E. Li W.P. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29024-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This is not the expected result if PCSK9 mostly targets LDLR by the extracellular pathway (18McNutt M.C. Kwon H.J. Chen C. Chen J.R. Horton J.D. Lagace T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10561-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), as one would have expected that in Arh−/− mice total LDLR levels should have been more elevated.In this study, we focused on the relative contribution of the intra- versus extracellular pathways of endogenous PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation. This information should guide the choice of therapeutic approaches that will best target the site of PCSK9-LDLR interaction to control hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease.DISCUSSIONThe cell surface internalization of PCSK9 depends primarily on the presence of LDLR and the adaptor protein ARH that binds the cytosolic tail of the LDLR (16Lagace T.A.

Aside from the extracellular pathway, the existence of an intracellular one is supported by the ability of PCSK9 to degrade the LDLR in vivo in the absence of ARH (9Park S.W. Moon Y.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol.

Thus, after 24-h incubations, only high, nonphysiological concentrations of WT PCSK9 can reduce LDLR levels in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 3) and in HepG2 cells (Figs. 1 and 5). Interestingly, we observed that in the plasma of Ldlr−/− mice the levels of circulating PCSK9 and its Furin-cleaved form (20Zaid A. Roubtsova A. Essalmani R. Marcinkiewicz J. Chamberland A.

Accordingly, the physiological role of circulating WT PCSK9 and its Furin-truncated form remains undefined. Although hepatocyte-specific transgenic mice weakly overexpressing PCSK9 (3-fold) exhibit no significant change in circulating LDL-cholesterol, a ∼30-fold overexpression increased it by ∼5-fold (20Zaid A.

Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1303-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) indicated that >100 nm amounts of circulating PCSK9 are required to affect liver LDLR protein levels significantly, without affecting extrahepatic LDLR. In that context, we recently showed that annexin A2 inhibits the effect of extracellular PCSK9 on LDLR, and in view of its absence from hepatocytes in vivo, it may exert its inhibitory effect in extrahepatic tissues (14Mayer G. Poirier S. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31791-31801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The available compiled data suggest that only supraphysiological levels of circulating PCSK9 have an impact on liver LDLR. Several ELISAs evaluated the level of circulating human PCSK9 to be ∼2–4 nm (16Lagace T.A. Curtis D.E. Garuti R. McNutt M.C. Park S.W. Prather H.B. Anderson N.N. Ho Y.K. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. J.

However, because the local concentration of PCSK9 secreted from hepatocytes into the extracellular microenvironment is expected to be much higher than in plasma, PCSK9 may well have an autocrine/paracrine effect in vivo.Our data revealed that a 4-h incubation of HepG2 cells with an EGF-AB peptide readily inhibits the LDLR-degrading activity of exogenously added PCSK9 but had little effect on endogenous secreted PCSK9 (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, it took at least 24 h to detect an effect of EGF-AB on LDLR levels and activity (Fig. 2, b and c). Thus, it is possible that the extracellular PCSK9 effect is a relatively slow process and may require a long incubation time and/or a critical threshold concentration. This may be related to the lower binding affinity of PCSK9 to LDLR at neutral versus acidic pH values (11Cunningham D. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Griffor M.C. Hawkins J.L. Subashi T.A. Varghese A.H.

Biol. 2007; 14: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).A very recent report revealed that a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that neutralizes the interaction of PCSK9 and LDLR is able to reduce the extracellular activity of PCSK9 both in naïve HepG2 cells and in vivo in mouse and cynomolgus monkey (38Chan J.C. Piper D.E. Cao Q. Liu D. King C. Wang W. Tang J. Liu Q. Higbee J. Xia Z. Di Y. Shetterly S. Arimura Z. Salomonis H. Romanow W.G. Thibault S.T. Zhang R. Cao P. Yang X.P. Yu T. Lu M. Retter M.W.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Similar to our data in HepG2 cells using EGF-AB as a neutralizing agent (Fig. 2), the mAb effect was only reported for times ≥24-h incubation. The latter seems to be due to a conformational change as the mAb does not completely mask the PCSK9-LDLR interaction surface (38Chan J.C. Piper D.E. Cao Q. Liu D. King C. Wang W. Tang J. Liu Q. Higbee J. Xia Z. Di Y. Shetterly S. Arimura Z. Salomonis H. Romanow W.G. Thibault S.T. Zhang R. Cao P. Yang X.P. Yu T. Lu M. Retter M.W. Kwon G. Henne K. Pan O. Tsai M.M. Fuchslocher B. Yang E.

Because no evidence was provided for antibody-antigen cellular internalization, we presume that the mAb blocks the extracellular PCSK9 effect on LDLR.Here, we showed that overexpression of PCSK9 or its D374Y mutant in HepG2 cells effectively reduces cell surface LDLR levels within 24 h. In contrast, only the D374Y mutant affects the levels of LDLR in nontransfected neighboring cells (Fig. 4), in agreement with its reported enhanced LDLR-binding affinity at neutral pH (11Cunningham D.

Concentrations of secreted PCSK9, up to 12 nm (HepG2 cells; ∼3× endogenous levels; Fig. 4) or 20 nm (HEK293 cells; supplemental Fig. S3), were unable to enhance the degradation of the LDLR on neighboring cells in 24 h. This suggests that within 24 h and at levels close to endogenous ones, PCSK9 exerts its function mostly intracellularly and/or in an autocrine fashion.Our previous work demonstrated the importance of clathrin heavy chain for the PCSK9-dependent degradation of the LDLR (10Nassoury N. Blasiole D.A. Tebon O.A. Benjannet S. Hamelin J. Poupon V. McPherson P.S. Attie A.D. Prat A. Seidah N.G. Traffic. 2007; 8: 718-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, because clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking is needed for both direct sorting from the trans-Golgi network to LE/L and internalization of cargo by endocytosis, the route taken by the PCSK9·LDLR complex remained unresolved. In the present work, our data support the presence of a relatively rapid intracellular route for the PCSK9-induced degradation of LDLR at endogenous levels because blockade of the trans-Golgi network to lysosome vesicular trafficking by KDCLCs clearly up-regulated LDLR levels already after 4 h (supplemental Fig. S5), without affecting endocytosis (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S4b). Even though the KDCLCs slows down the activation of procathepsin D (19Poupon V. Girard M. Legendre-Guillemin V. Thomas S. Bourbonniere L. Philie J. Bright N.A. McPherson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), a lysosomal hydrolase that is targeted to LE/L, our results also showed that after KDCLCs, the cognate hydrolases retained their capacity to degrade the LDLR (Fig. 5e). In addition, we also demonstrated that the effect of KDCLCs is PCSK9-dependent because LDLR levels are no longer affected when PCSK9 is absent (Fig. 5f). Although the level of LDLR is increased, its intracellular and surface localization remained comparable in cells lacking CLCs (supplemental Fig. S4a). Similarly, intracellular and secreted levels as well as the localization of PCSK9 were not significantly altered by KDCLCs (data not shown). Thus, although the underlying mechanism of CLCs effect is presently not fully unraveled, it may rely on another factor that is essential for the direct intracellular trafficking of PCSK9 to the LDLR degradation compartment(s).PCSK9 has emerged as a viable attractive target to reduce coronary heart disease through control of dyslipidemias (39Seidah N.G. Expert. Opin. Ther. Targets. 2009; 13: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The choice of the best approach to diminish the effect of PCSK9 on LDLR degradation in vivo effectively may be influenced by the relative contribution of both cellular pathways under physiological and pathological conditions. The combination of a statin with an agent that blocks either the extracellular pathway (38Chan J.C. Piper D.E. Cao Q. Liu D. King C. Wang W. Tang J. Liu Q. Higbee J. Xia Z. Di Y. Shetterly S.

With the rapid pace of discoveries in the field, it is hoped that in a few years lead molecules reducing the level and/or activity of PCSK9 will be uncovered and that these will find their way in clinical trials to assess their potency and safety.

This catabolic route is down-regulated in plants during osmotic stress, allowing free Pro accumulation. We show here that overexpression of MsProDH in tobacco and Arabidopsis or impairment of P5C oxidation in the Arabidopsis p5cdh mutant did not change the cellular Pro to P5C ratio under ambient and osmotic stress conditions, indicating that P5C excess was reduced to Pro in a mitochondrial-cytosolic cycle. This cycle, involving ProDH and P5C reductase, exists in animal cells and now demonstrated in plants. As a part of the cycle, Pro oxidation by the ProDH-FAD complex delivers electrons to the electron transport chain. Hyperactivity of the cycle, e.g. when an excess of exogenous l-Pro is provided, generates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) by delivering electrons to O2, as demonstrated by the mitochondria-specific MitoSox staining of superoxide ions. Lack of P5CDH activity led to higher ROS production under dark and light conditions in the presence of Pro excess, as well as rendered plants hypersensitive to heat stress. Balancing mitochondrial ROS production during increased Pro oxidation is therefore critical for avoiding Pro-related toxic effects. Hence, normal oxidation of P5C to Glu by P5CDH is key to prevent P5C-Pro intensive cycling and avoid ROS production from electron run-off.

P5CS is considered the key enzyme in the synthesis route, and its expression is increased by osmotic stress in many plants (11Roosens N.H. Willem R. Li Y. Verbruggen I.I. Biesemans M. Jacobs M.

Van de Cotte B. Van Montagu M. Verbruggen N. Plant J. 2001; 26: 157-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the catabolic route, proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) catalyzes Pro oxidation to P5C, which is maintained in a pH-dependent nonenzymatic equilibrium with glutamate semialdehyde (GSA) (21Tanner J.J. Amino Acids. 2008; 34: 719-730Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ProDH is an FAD-dependent enzyme localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and transfers electrons directly to the mitochondrial electron chain during Pro oxidation (21Tanner J.J. Amino Acids. 2008; 34: 719-730Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In all plants studied to date, transcription and enzymatic activity of ProDH decrease during osmotic stress and rapidly increase during the consecutive recovery period. These changes are inversely correlated with cellular free Pro levels (22Rayapati P.J. Stewart C.R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Peng Z. Lu Q.

Microarray expression data indicated that AtProDH2 (At5g38710) is transcribed at low levels during different stresses (Genevestigator) (26Zimmermann P. Hirsch-Hoffmann M. Hennig L. Gruissem W. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2621-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and is regulated by sucrose in a similar way to AtProDH1 (27Hanson J. Hanssen M. Wiese A. Hendriks M.M. Smeekens S. Plant J. 2008; 53: 935-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although little is known about the function of AtProDH2, many studies identified AtProDH1 as the major Pro oxidizing enzyme (7Mani S. Van De Cotte B. Van Montagu M. Verbruggen N.

An antisense overlapping of AtP5CDH and AtSRO5, whose transcription is induced by salinity (150 mm NaCl), enables salt-induced production of nat-small interfering RNA that initiates RNA interference-based AtP5CDH mRNA degradation (31Borsani O.

However, during 100 mm NaCl treatment, in both Arabidopsis and alfalfa, P5CDH transcript levels remained unchanged or even increased at late stages of the stress period (12Miller G. Stein H. Honig A.

In contrast to endogenous stress-accumulated Pro, exogenously provided Pro is toxic at millimolar concentrations, leading to programmed cell death in yeast, human cancer cells, and plant cells (33Bonner C.A.

Furthermore, high levels of P5C in the yeast put2 mutant, which lacks P5CDH expression, were associated with increased ROS production. It was therefore suggested that Pro toxicity in yeast results from increased P5C levels (36Nomura M. Takagi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We describe here a novel plant P5C-Pro cycling mechanism, whereby P5C excess, resulting from Pro oxidation by mitochondrial ProDH, is reduced by cytosolic P5CR to Pro and transported back to the organelle. This cycle is highly similar to the “proline cycle” in mammalian cells (1Hu C.A. Donald S.P. Yu J. Lin W.W. Liu Z. Steel G. Obie C. Valle D. Phang J.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2007; 295: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39Yoon K.A. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 49: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that neither enhanced production nor reduced oxidation of P5C changes the cellular Pro to P5C ratio, which is maintained by a rapid P5C reduction to Pro. When the intake of externally provided Pro exceeds its physiological levels accumulated under stress conditions, P5C oxidation by P5CDH is essential for limiting P5C-Pro cycle activity and avoiding high levels of mitochondrial ROS production. MS salts were obtained from Duchefa (Haarlem, Netherlands) (12Miller G. Stein H. Honig A. Kapulnik Y. Zilberstein A. Planta. 2005; 222: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). l-Thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (T4C), O-amino-benzaldehyde, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, dl-P5C-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine-hydrochloride double salt, and PD10 desalting columns were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Purified P5C was obtained by removing the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine salt with acetophenone (supplemental data). Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun (NN) and Arabidopsis thaliana cv. Columbia (Col-0) were grown at 25 or 22 °C, respectively, in a 16-h light/8-h dark regime, at light intensity of 100 μmol cm−2 s−1. The p5cdh T-DNA knock-out mutant was obtained from ABRC, and homozygous plants were identified using the SIGnAL (Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory) recommended primers. This mutant (Salk_018453) had already been described by Deuschle et al. (37Deuschle K. Funck D. Forlani G. Stransky H. Biehl A. Leister D. van der Graaff E. Kunze R. Frommer W.B.

For salt stress, which lasted 5 weeks, 6-week-old WT and ProDH-OE tobacco plants were irrigated with 300 mm NaCl (a total of 2 liters was applied gradually during the stress period to 2 liters of soil). Drought (dehydration) stress was imposed for 72 h on 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown on MS-soaked vermiculite (supplemental data). These plants were then rehydrated for 3 days by adding the lost water volume. Water loss of vermiculite containers and values of relative water content were similar for WT and p5cdh plants during the drought and recovery periods (supplemental Fig. S6). l-Pro was applied to the seedlings by saturating the vermiculite in bottom-pierced cups with 100 mm l-Pro solution. Root elongation in response to heat stress (38 °C) was measured in seedlings grown on MS plates as described previously (40Davletova S. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shengqiang Z. Oliver D.J. Coutu J.

One-week-old WT and ProDH-OE tobacco seedlings (T2) were transferred to MS medium containing 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm T4C, or 50 mm NaCl + 3 mm T4C. Pictures were taken 3 weeks later. Toxicity assays of 1 mm P5C, 100 mm Pro, or 1 mm 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine hydrochloride were conducted on 2-week-old Arabidopsis plants in 6-well plates containing liquid MS. Transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis plants, constitutively expressing MsProDH1 cDNA (12Miller G. Stein H. Honig A. Kapulnik Y. Zilberstein A.

Total RNA isolation and Northern blot analyses were performed according to Miller et al. (12Miller G. Stein H. Honig A. Kapulnik Y. Zilberstein A. Planta. 2005; 222: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Pro oxidation was measured in vitro, using leaf proteins as the enzyme source, Pro and NAD+ as substrates. NAD+ reduction was measured at 340 nm (supplemental data). Total RNA was extracted from frozen Arabidopsis tissues and treated with RNase-free DNaseI using the SV total RNA isolation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using 3 μg of total RNA as a template, an oligo(dT) primer, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed using 1/100 volume of the cDNA reaction as the template (supplemental data). Similarly to Pro, P5C reacts with ninhydrin (47Kim H.R. Rho H.W. Park J.W. Park B.H. Kim J.S. Lee M.W. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in the commonly used Pro colorimetric determination of Miller et al. (12Miller G. Stein H. Honig A. Kapulnik Y. Zilberstein A. Planta. 2005; 222: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Bates et al. (48Bates L.S. Waldren I.P. Teare I.D. Plant Soil. 1973; 39: 205-207Crossref Scopus (11956) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1A). By quantifying purified P5C and l-Pro, using separate ninhydrin reactions, we could show that the absorbance of the P5C-ninhydrin complex is ∼65% of that of the Pro-ninhydrin complex in a range of known concentrations (supplemental Fig. S1B). To the best of our knowledge all previous studies that have used the ninhydrin assay for Pro quantification have not taken into account the absorbance of the P5C-ninhydrin complex. To estimate the net levels of Pro in vivo, P5C values determined by the O-amino-benzaldehyde assay (see below) were subtracted from the Pro+P5C values measured by the ninhydrin reaction according to the following procedure: leaf samples were homogenized in 3% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid and centrifuged for 10 min. Half of the supernatant was used for Pro determination, and half was used for P5C determination by the O-amino-benzaldehyde assay at 440 nm (49Mezl V.A. Knox W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 50Yang C.W. Kao C.H. Plant Growth Regul. 1999; 27: 191-194Crossref Google Scholar). Known concentrations of l-Pro and dl-P5C as 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine-hydrochloride-double salt (detailed in the supplemental data) were used for estimating Pro and P5C concentrations in plant extracts. Primary metabolites of WT and p5cdh plants were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry according to Ref. 51Brosché M. Vinocur B. Alatalo E.R. Lamminmäki A. Teichmann T.

Plants were grown on vermiculite and exposed to dehydration as described above. Five biological replicates, each comprising a mixture of leaves collected from 15–20 plants (100 mg of fresh weight), were analyzed in each treatment. MitoSox-Red (5 μm; Molecular Probes-Invitrogen) was used for imaging superoxide accumulation in mitochondria of root cells, as described in the supplemental data. The sequence data used in this study are found in the NCBI GenBankTM data base under the following accession numbers: AY556386 (MsProDH1), At5g62530 (AtP5CDH), At5g14800 (AtP5CR), At2g39800 (AtP5CS1), At3g55610 (AtP5CS2), At3g30775 (AtProDH1), and At5g38710 (AtProDH2). The most prominent changes in cellular Pro levels occur in plants during the imposition of different abiotic stresses and subsequent recovery processes, when high levels of Pro are being synthesized and catabolized, respectively, within a short time (7Mani S. Van De Cotte B. Van Montagu M. Verbruggen N. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Miller G. Stein H. Honig A. Kapulnik Y. Zilberstein A. Planta. 2005; 222: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To estimate the linkage between down-regulated Pro catabolism and Pro accumulation during stress, we generated transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively overexpress alfalfa (Medicago sativa) MsProDH1 (12Miller G. Stein H. Honig A. Kapulnik Y. Zilberstein A. Planta. 2005; 222: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), assuming that these plants (ProDH-OE) will show reduced levels of Pro during exposure to stress. Northern blot analysis of leaf RNA extracted from ProDH-OE plants (T2 generation) confirmed the presence of high levels of MsProDH1 transcripts under normal and salt stress conditions (Fig. 2A). Pro oxidizing capacity in planta was evaluated in ProDH-OE lines (T3 generation) by examining their ability to detoxify T4C. This Pro analogue can be oxidized by plant or prokaryotic Pro-dehydrogenases (30Elthon T.E. Stewart C.R. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 567-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Deutch C.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1593-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). WT tobacco plants showed retarded growth in the presence of T4C (Fig. 2B, upper panel). The addition of a low NaCl concentration (50 mm), which represses endogenous ProDH expression (12Miller G. Stein H. Honig A. Kapulnik Y. Zilberstein A. Planta. 2005; 222: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), greatly increased the sensitivity of WT plants to T4C (Fig. 2B, upper panel, T4C+NaCl treatment). In contrast, transgenic plants that constitutively overexpressed MsProDH were much more tolerant to T4C, even under salt stress conditions (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Furthermore, the Pro oxidation assay, performed in vitro using increasing l-Pro concentrations as the substrate, showed higher ProDH activity in leaves of drought-stressed ProDH-OE plants in comparison with WT plants (Fig. 2C). These results confirmed that in the transgenic tobacco lines the ectopic MsProDH is not only synthesized but is also enzymatically active and capable of degrading Pro and T4C, thereby eliminating T4C toxicity when the two endogenous NtProDHs (52Ribarits A. Abdullaev A. Tashpulatov A. Richter A. Heberle-Bors E. Touraev A. Planta. 2007; 225: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) are less active (Fig. 2C). We next exposed WT and ProDH-OE plants to salt stress to evaluate the effects of increased Pro oxidation on Pro accumulation and stress tolerance. Six-week-old WT and ProDH-OE plants were irrigated with 300 mm NaCl, and the free Pro content of leaves was measured after 5 weeks of stress. No significant decrease in free Pro accumulation was detected in ProDH-OE plants. Both WT and ProDH-OE plants increased their Pro levels by more than 230-fold (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, no significant effect on growth rate or osmotolerance of the ProDH-OE compared with WT plants was observed (supplemental Fig. S3). Shorter exposures of 48 and 72 h to 150 mm NaCl also showed similar levels of Pro accumulation in both plant types (data not shown). Increased Pro oxidation in ProDH-OE plants was expected to result in elevated levels of P5C, the first breakdown product (Fig. 1). However, comparable levels of P5C were observed in both WT and ProDH-OE plants, with a 2.5–3-fold increase in P5C content during the salt stress treatment (Fig. 3B). Compared with the 230-fold elevation in Pro content (Fig. 3A), this 3-fold P5C increase is very minor (Fig. 3), indicating that P5C did not accumulate to high levels during salinity stress, not even when the introduced MsProDH remained active. Thus, in ProDH- OE plants, as in WT, the equilibrium between Pro and P5C is maintained. To examine whether a general tendency to maintain a balanced Pro to P5C ratio in plants exposed to abiotic stresses exists, A. thaliana (Col-0) plants overexpressing MsProDH1 were generated and exposed to dehydration stress. In these plants, the transcript levels of the ectopic MsProDH were 4–7-fold higher than the levels of the endogenous ProDH1 and ProDH2 transcripts after 48 h of dehydration (supplemental Fig. S4A). However, despite the high expression of MsProDH, comparable levels of accumulated Pro and P5C were observed in WT, ProDH-4, and ProDH-5 plants (supplemental Fig. S4, B and C). These results indicated that P5C produced by the foreign MsProDH is converted to its WT levels in tobacco and Arabidopsis plants grown under ambient and stress conditions. The comparable high Pro to P5C ratio observed in WT and ProDH-OE plants during exposure to salinity or dehydration stress, despite increased Pro oxidation in ProDH-OE plants, suggested that Pro and P5C are constantly cycled betwee"
https://openalex.org/W2115449759,"Background Depression is experienced as a persistent low mood or anhedonia accompanied by behavioural and cognitive disturbances which impair day to day functioning. However, the diagnosis is largely based on self-reported symptoms, and there are no neurobiological markers to guide the choice of treatment. In the present study, we examined the prognostic and diagnostic potential of the structural neural correlates of depression. Methodology and Principal Findings Subjects were 37 patients with major depressive disorder (mean age 43.2 years), medication-free, in an acute depressive episode, and 37 healthy individuals. Following the MRI scan, 30 patients underwent treatment with the antidepressant medication fluoxetine or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Of the patients who subsequently achieved clinical remission with antidepressant medication, the whole brain structural neuroanatomy predicted 88.9% of the clinical response, prior to the initiation of treatment (88.9% patients in clinical remission (sensitivity) and 88.9% patients with residual symptoms (specificity), p = 0.01). Accuracy of the structural neuroanatomy as a diagnostic marker though was 67.6% (64.9% patients (sensitivity) and 70.3% healthy individuals (specificity), p = 0.027). Conclusions and Significance The structural neuroanatomy of depression shows high predictive potential for clinical response to antidepressant medication, while its diagnostic potential is more limited. The present findings provide initial steps towards the development of neurobiological prognostic markers for depression."

Fruit-eating bats of the Pteropus genus have been suggested as their natural reservoir. Human Henipavirus infections have been reported in a region extending from Australia via Malaysia into Bangladesh, compatible with the geographic range of Pteropus. These bats do not occur in continental Africa, but a whole range of other fruit bats is encountered. One of the most abundant is Eidolon helvum, the African Straw-coloured fruit bat. Methodology/Principal Findings Feces from E. helvum roosting in an urban setting in Kumasi/Ghana were tested for Henipavirus RNA. Sequences of three novel viruses in phylogenetic relationship to known Henipaviruses were detected. Virus RNA concentrations in feces were low. Conclusions/Significance The finding of novel putative Henipaviruses outside Australia and Asia contributes a significant extension of the region of potential endemicity of one of the most pathogenic virus genera known in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2076724288,"During normal development or during disease, animal cells experience hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions, and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors implement most of the critical changes in gene expression that enable animals to adapt to this stress. Here, we examine the roles of HIF-1 in post-mitotic aging. We examined the effects of HIF-1 over-expression and of hif-1 loss-of-function mutations on longevity in C. elegans, a powerful genetic system in which adult somatic cells are post-mitotic. We constructed transgenic lines that expressed varying levels of HIF-1 protein and discovered a positive correlation between HIF-1 expression levels and lifespan. The data further showed that HIF-1 acted in parallel to the SKN-1/NRF and DAF-16/FOXO transcription factors to promote longevity. HIF-1 over-expression also conferred increased resistance to heat and oxidative stress. We isolated and characterized additional hif-1 mutations, and we found that each of 3 loss-of-function mutations conferred increased longevity in normal lab culture conditions, but, unlike HIF-1 over-expression, a hif-1 deletion mutation did not extend the lifespan of daf-16 or skn-1 mutants. We conclude that HIF-1 over-expression and hif-1 loss-of-function mutations promote longevity by different pathways. These data establish HIF-1 as one of the key stress-responsive transcription factors that modulate longevity in C. elegans and advance our understanding of the regulatory networks that link oxygen homeostasis and aging."
https://openalex.org/W2111217479,"Metastasis is associated with the loss of epithelial features and the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and invasive properties by tumor cells, a process known as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Snail expression, through nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation, is an EMT determinant. The proteasome inhibitor, NPI-0052, induces the metastasis tumor suppressor/immune surveillance cancer gene, Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), via NF-κB inhibition. We hypothesized that NPI-0052 may inhibit Snail expression and, consequently, the metastatic phenotype in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Cell treatment with NPI-0052 induced E-cadherin and inhibited Snail expression and both tumor cell invasion and migration. Inhibition of Snail inversely correlated with the induction of RKIP. The underlying mechanism of NPI-0052-induced inhibition of the metastatic phenotype was corroborated by: (1) treatment with Snail siRNA in DU-145 inhibited EMT and, in contrast, overexpression of Snail in the nonmetastatic LNCaP cells induced EMT, (2) NPI-0052-induced repression of Snail via inhibition of NF-κB was corroborated by the specific NF-κB inhibitor DHMEQ and (3) RKIP overexpression mimicked NPI-0052 in the inhibition of Snail and EMT. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the role of NPI-0052 in the regulation of EMT via inhibition of NF-κB and Snail and induction of RKIP."
https://openalex.org/W2009269237,"Pancreatic beta-cells couple the oxidation of glucose to the secretion of insulin. Apart from the canonical K(ATP)-dependent glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), there are important K(ATP)-independent mechanisms involving both anaplerosis and mitochondrial GTP (mtGTP). How mtGTP that is trapped within the mitochondrial matrix regulates the cytosolic calcium increases that drive GSIS remains a mystery. Here we have investigated whether the mitochondrial isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M) is the GTPase linking hydrolysis of mtGTP made by succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS-GTP) to an anaplerotic pathway producing phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Although cytosolic PEPCK (PEPCK-C) is absent, PEPCK-M message and protein were detected in INS-1 832/13 cells, rat islets, and mouse islets. PEPCK enzymatic activity is half that of primary hepatocytes and is localized exclusively to the mitochondria. Novel (13)C-labeling strategies in INS-1 832/13 cells and islets measured substantial contribution of PEPCK-M to the synthesis of PEP. As high as 30% of PEP in INS-1 832/13 cells and 41% of PEP in rat islets came from PEPCK-M. The contribution of PEPCK-M to overall PEP synthesis more than tripled with glucose stimulation. Silencing the PEPCK-M gene completely inhibited GSIS underscoring its central role in mitochondrial metabolism-mediated insulin secretion. Given that mtGTP synthesized by SCS-GTP is an indicator of TCA flux that is crucial for GSIS, PEPCK-M is a strong candidate to link mtGTP synthesis with insulin release through anaplerotic PEP cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2096349101,"Production of major diterpenoid phytoalexins, momilactones and phytocassanes, is induced in rice upon recognition of pathogenic invasion as plant defense-related compounds. We recently showed that biosynthetic genes for momilactones are clustered on rice chromosome 4 and co-expressed after elicitation, mimicking pathogen attack. Because genes for most metabolic pathways in plants are not organized in gene clusters, examination of the mechanism(s) regulating the expression of such clustered genes is needed. Here, we report a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-inducible basic leucine zipper transcription factor, OsTGAP1, which is essential for momilactone biosynthesis and regulates the expression of the five genes in the cluster. The knock-out mutant for <i>OsTGAP1</i> had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (<i>OsCPS4</i>, <i>OsKSL4</i>, <i>CYP99A2</i>, <i>CYP99A3</i>, and <i>OsMAS</i>) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment. Inductive expression of <i>OsKSL7</i> for phytocassane biosynthesis was also largely affected in the <i>ostgap1</i> mutant, although phytocassane accumulation still occurred. Conversely, OsTGAP1-overexpressing lines exhibited enhanced expression of the clustered genes and hyperaccumulation of momilactones in response to the elicitor. Furthermore, enhanced expression of <i>OsKSL7</i> and hyperaccumulation of phytocassanes was also observed. We also found that OsTGAP1 overexpression can influence transcriptional up-regulation of <i>OsDXS3</i> in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, eventually leading to inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins. These results indicate that OsTGAP1 functions as a key regulator of the coordinated transcription of genes involved in inductive diterpenoid phytoalexin production in rice and mainly exerts an essential role on expression of the clustered genes for momilactone biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2091703726,"Misexpression of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) components in human cells profoundly influences the onset of cellular senescence by modulating transcription of the INK4a tumor suppressor gene. Using tandem affinity purification, we find that CBX7 and CBX8, two Polycomb (Pc) homologs that repress INK4a, both participate in PRC1-like complexes with at least two Posterior sex combs (Psc) proteins, MEL18 and BMI1. Each complex contains a single representative of the Pc and Psc families. In primary human fibroblasts, CBX7, CBX8, MEL18 and BMI1 are present at the INK4a locus and shRNA-mediated knockdown of any one of these components results in de-repression of INK4a and proliferative arrest. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) reveals that CBX7 and CBX8 bind simultaneously to the same region of chromatin and knockdown of one of the Pc or Psc proteins results in release of the other, suggesting that the binding of PRC1 complexes is interdependent. Our findings provide the first evidence that a single gene can be regulated by several distinct PRC1 complexes and raise important questions about their configuration and relative functions."
https://openalex.org/W2001401225,"Background Commensal and symbiotic microbes have a considerable impact on the behavior of many arthropod hosts, including hematophagous species that transmit pathogens causing infectious diseases to human and animals. Little is known about the bacteria associated with mosquitoes other than the vectorized pathogens. This study investigated Wolbachia and cultivable bacteria that persist through generations in Ae. albopictus organs known to host transmitted arboviruses, such as dengue and chikungunya. Methodology/Principal Findings We used culturing, diagnostic and quantitative PCR, as well as in situ hybridization, to detect and locate bacteria in whole individual mosquitoes and in dissected tissues. Wolbachia, cultivable bacteria of the genera Acinetobacter, Comamonas, Delftia and Pseudomonas co-occurred and persisted in the bodies of both males and females of Ae. albopictus initially collected in La Réunion during the chikungunya outbreak, and maintained as colonies in insectaries. In dissected tissues, Wolbachia and the cultivable Acinetobacter can be detected in the salivary glands. The other bacteria are commonly found in the gut. Quantitative PCR estimates suggest that Wolbachia densities are highest in ovaries, lower than those of Acinetobacter in the gut, and approximately equal to those of Acinetobacter in the salivary glands. Hybridization using specific fluorescent probes successfully localized Wolbachia in all germ cells, including the oocytes, and in the salivary glands, whereas the Acinetobacter hybridizing signal was mostly located in the foregut and in the anterior midgut. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that Proteobacteria are distributed in the somatic and reproductive tissues of mosquito where transmissible pathogens reside and replicate. This location may portend the coexistence of symbionts and pathogens, and thus the possibility that competition or cooperation phenomena may occur in the mosquito vector Ae. albopictus. Improved understanding of the vectorial system, including the role of bacteria in the vector's biology and competence, could have major implications for understanding viral emergences and for disease control."
https://openalex.org/W2135997854,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are a highly prevalent cause of acute respiratory infection in children. They are classified into at least three species, HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C, which are characterized by sequencing the 5' untranslated region (UTR) or the VP4/VP2 region of the genome. Given the increased interest for novel HRV strain identification and their worldwide distribution, we have carried out clinical and molecular diagnosis of HRV strains in a 2-year study of children with acute respiratory infection visiting one district hospital in Shanghai.We cloned and sequenced a 924-nt fragment that covered part of the 5'UTR and the VP4/VP2 capsid genes. Sixty-four HRV-infected outpatients were diagnosed amongst 827 children with acute low respiratory tract infection. Two samples were co-infected with HRV-A and HRV-B or HRV-C. By comparative analysis of the VP4/VP2 sequences of the 66 HRVs, we showed a high diversity of strains in HRV-A and HRV-B species, and a prevalence of 51.5% of strains that belonged to the recently identified HRV-C species. When analyzing a fragment of the 5' UTR, we characterized at least two subspecies of HRV-C: HRV-Cc, which clustered differently from HRV-A and HRV-B, and HRV-Ca, which resulted from previous recombination in this region with sequences related to HRV-A. The full-length sequence of one strain of each HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc subspecies was obtained for comparative analysis. We confirmed the close relationship of their structural proteins but showed apparent additional recombination events in the 2A gene and 3'UTR of the HRV-Ca strain. Double or triple infections with HRV-C and respiratory syncytial virus and/or bocavirus were diagnosed in 33.3% of the HRV-infected patients, but no correlation with severity of clinical outcome was observed.Our study showed a high diversity of HRV strains that cause bronchitis and pneumonia in children. A predominance of HRV-C over HRV-A and HRV-B was observed, and two subspecies of HRV-C were identified, the diversity of which seemed to be related to recombination with former HRV-A strains. None of the HRV-C strains appeared to have a higher clinical impact than HRV-A or HRV-B on respiratory compromise."
https://openalex.org/W2164772047,"Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) threatens public health worldwide, and epidemiologic data suggest that the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) expressed by most CA-MRSA strains could contribute to severe human infections, particularly in young and immunocompetent hosts.

However, recent comparisons of isogenic CA-MRSA strains with or without PVL have revealed no differences in human PMN cytolytic activity. Furthermore, many of the mouse studies performed to date have failed to demonstrate a virulence role for PVL, thereby provoking the question: does PVL have a mechanistic role in human infection? In this report, we evaluated the contribution of PVL to severe skin and soft tissue infection. We generated PVL mutants in CA-MRSA strains isolated from patients with necrotizing fasciitis and used these tools to evaluate the pathogenic role of PVL in vivo. In a model of necrotizing soft tissue infection, we found PVL caused significant damage of muscle but not the skin. Muscle injury was linked to induction of pro-inflammatory chemokines KC, MIP-2, and RANTES, and recruitment of neutrophils. Tissue damage was most prominent in young mice and in those strains of mice that more effectively cleared S. aureus, and was not significant in older mice and mouse strains that had a more limited immune response to the pathogen. PVL mediated injury could be blocked by pretreatment with anti-PVL antibodies. Our data provide new insights into CA-MRSA pathogenesis, epidemiology and therapeutics. PVL could contribute to the increased incidence of myositis in CA-MRSA infection, and the toxin could mediate tissue injury by mechanisms other than direct killing of phagocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2139828075,"Mammalian retinae have rod photoreceptors for night vision and cone photoreceptors for daylight and colour vision. For colour discrimination, most mammals possess two cone populations with two visual pigments (opsins) that have absorption maxima at short wavelengths (blue or ultraviolet light) and long wavelengths (green or red light). Microchiropteran bats, which use echolocation to navigate and forage in complete darkness, have long been considered to have pure rod retinae. Here we use opsin immunohistochemistry to show that two phyllostomid microbats, Glossophaga soricina and Carollia perspicillata, possess a significant population of cones and express two cone opsins, a shortwave-sensitive (S) opsin and a longwave-sensitive (L) opsin. A substantial population of cones expresses S opsin exclusively, whereas the other cones mostly coexpress L and S opsin. S opsin gene analysis suggests ultraviolet (UV, wavelengths <400 nm) sensitivity, and corneal electroretinogram recordings reveal an elevated sensitivity to UV light which is mediated by an S cone visual pigment. Therefore bats have retained the ancestral UV tuning of the S cone pigment. We conclude that bats have the prerequisite for daylight vision, dichromatic colour vision, and UV vision. For bats, the UV-sensitive cones may be advantageous for visual orientation at twilight, predator avoidance, and detection of UV-reflecting flowers for those that feed on nectar."
https://openalex.org/W2143503237,MicroRNA (miRNA) and other types of small regulatory RNAs play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Several distinct classes of small regulatory RNAs have been discovered in recent years. To extend the repertoire of small RNAs characterized in mammals and to examine relationship between host miRNA expression and viral infection we used Illumina's ultrahigh throughput sequencing approach. We sequenced three small RNA libraries prepared from cell line derived from the adult bovine kidney under normal conditions and upon infection of the cell line with Bovine herpesvirus 1. We used a bioinformatics approach to distinguish authentic mature miRNA sequences from other classes of small RNAs and short RNA fragments represented in the sequencing data. Using this approach we detected 219 out of 356 known bovine miRNAs and 115 respective miRNA* sequences. In addition we identified five new bovine orthologs of known mammalian miRNAs and discovered 268 new cow miRNAs many of which are not identifiable in other mammalian genomes and thus might be specific to the ruminant lineage. In addition we found seven new bovine mirtron candidates. We also discovered 10 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) loci that give rise to small RNA with possible miRNA-like function. Results presented in this study extend our knowledge of the biology and evolution of small regulatory RNAs in mammals and illuminate mechanisms of small RNA biogenesis and function. New miRNA sequences and the original sequencing data have been submitted to miRNA repository (miRBase) and NCBI GEO archive respectively. We envisage that these resources will facilitate functional annotation of the bovine genome and promote further functional and comparative genomics studies of small regulatory RNA in mammals.
https://openalex.org/W2032949626,"Galectin-1 is a galactoside-binding lectin expressed in multiple tissues that has pleiotropic immunomodulatory functions. We previously showed that galectin-1 activates human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and triggers a specific genetic program that up-regulates DC migration through the extracellular matrix, an integral property of mucosal DCs. Here, we identify the galectin-1 receptors on MDDCs and immediate downstream effectors of galectin-1-induced MDDC activation and migration. Galectin-1 binding to surface CD43 and CD45 on MDDCs induced an unusual unipolar co-clustering of these receptors and activates a dose-dependent calcium flux that is abrogated by lactose. Using a kinome screen and a systems biology approach, we identified Syk and protein kinase C tyrosine kinases as mediators of the DC activation effects of galectin-1. Galectin-1, but not lipopolysaccharide, stimulated Syk phosphorylation and recruitment of phosphorylated Syk to the CD43 and CD45 co-cluster on MDDCs. Inhibitors of Syk and protein kinase C signaling abrogated galectin-1-induced DC activation as monitored by interleukin-6 production; and MMP-1, -10, and -12 gene up-regulation; and enhanced migration through the extracellular matrix. The latter two are specific features of galectin-1-activated DCs. Interestingly, we also found that galectin-1 can prime DCs to respond more quickly to low dose lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Finally, we underscore the biological relevance of galectin-1-enhanced DC migration by showing that intradermal injection of galectin-1 in MRL-fas mice, which have a defect in skin DC emigration, increased the in vivo migration of dermal DCs to draining lymph nodes."
https://openalex.org/W2160957891,"Choline and betaine provide methyl groups for one-carbon metabolism. Humans obtain these nutrients from a wide range of foods. Betaine can also be synthesized endogenously from its precursor, choline. Although animal studies have implied a causal relationship between choline deficiency and carcinogenesis, the role of these two nutrients in human carcinogenesis and tumor progression is not well understood. We investigated the associations of dietary intakes of choline and betaine and breast cancer risk and mortality in the population-based Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project. Among the 1508 case-group women, 308 (20.2%) deaths occurred, among whom 164 (53.2%) died of breast cancer by December 31, 2005. There was an indication that a higher intake of free choline was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer (P(trend)=0.04). Higher intakes of betaine, phosphocholine, and free choline were associated with reduced all-cause as well as breast cancer-specific mortality in a dose-dependent fashion. We also explored associations of polymorphisms of three key choline- and betaine-metabolizing genes and breast cancer mortality. The betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase gene (BHMT) rs3733890 polymorphism was associated with reduced breast cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.97). Our study supports the important roles of choline and betaine in breast carcinogenesis. It suggests that high intake of these nutrients may be a promising strategy to prevent the development of breast cancer and to reduce its mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2102947984,"Nitrate, one of the major nitrogen sources for plants, is stored in the vacuole. Nitrate accumulation within the vacuole is primarily mediated by the NO(3)(-)/H(+) exchanger AtCLCa, which belongs to the chloride channel (CLC) family. Crystallography analysis of hCLC5 suggested that the C-terminal domain, composed by two cystathionine beta-synthetase motifs in all eukaryotic members of the CLC family is able to interact with ATP. However, interaction of nucleotides with a functional CLC protein has not been unambiguously demonstrated. Here we show that ATP reversibly inhibits AtCLCa by interacting with the C-terminal domain. Applying the patch clamp technique to isolated Arabidopsis thaliana vacuoles, we demonstrate that ATP reduces AtCLCa activity with a maximum inhibition of 60%. ATP inhibition of nitrate influx into the vacuole at cytosolic physiological nitrate concentrations suggests that ATP modulation is physiologically relevant. ADP and AMP do not decrease the AtCLCa transport activity; nonetheless, AMP (but not ADP) competes with ATP, preventing inhibition. A molecular model of the C terminus of AtCLCa was built by homology to hCLC5 C terminus. The model predicted the effects of mutations of the ATP binding site on the interaction energy between ATP and AtCLCa that were further confirmed by functional expression of site-directed mutated AtCLCa."
https://openalex.org/W2034646895,"Efforts to unravel the mechanisms underlying taste sensation (gustation) have largely focused on rodents. Here we present the first comprehensive characterization of gene expression in primate taste buds. Our findings reveal unique new insights into the biology of taste buds. We generated a taste bud gene expression database using laser capture microdissection (LCM) procured fungiform (FG) and circumvallate (CV) taste buds from primates. We also used LCM to collect the top and bottom portions of CV taste buds. Affymetrix genome wide arrays were used to analyze gene expression in all samples. Known taste receptors are preferentially expressed in the top portion of taste buds. Genes associated with the cell cycle and stem cells are preferentially expressed in the bottom portion of taste buds, suggesting that precursor cells are located there. Several chemokines including CXCL14 and CXCL8 are among the highest expressed genes in taste buds, indicating that immune system related processes are active in taste buds. Several genes expressed specifically in endocrine glands including growth hormone releasing hormone and its receptor are also strongly expressed in taste buds, suggesting a link between metabolism and taste. Cell type-specific expression of transcription factors and signaling molecules involved in cell fate, including KIT, reveals the taste bud as an active site of cell regeneration, differentiation, and development. IKBKAP, a gene mutated in familial dysautonomia, a disease that results in loss of taste buds, is expressed in taste cells that communicate with afferent nerve fibers via synaptic transmission. This database highlights the power of LCM coupled with transcriptional profiling to dissect the molecular composition of normal tissues, represents the most comprehensive molecular analysis of primate taste buds to date, and provides a foundation for further studies in diverse aspects of taste biology."
https://openalex.org/W2065502412,"The failure of conventional therapies in glioblastoma (GBM) is largely due to an aberrant activity of survival cascades, such as PI3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt-mediated signaling. This study is the first to show that the class I PI3K inhibitor, PI-103, enhances chemotherapy-induced cell death of GBM cells. Concurrent treatment with PI-103 and DNA-damaging drugs, in particular doxorubicin, significantly increases apoptosis and reduces colony formation compared with chemotherapy treatment alone. The underlying molecular mechanism for this chemosensitization was shown by two independent approaches, that is, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of PI3K, DNA-PK and mTOR, to involve inhibition of DNA-PK-mediated DNA repair. Accordingly, blockage of PI3K or DNA-PK, but not of mTOR, significantly delays the resolution of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage and concomitantly increases apoptosis. Importantly, not only are several GBM cell lines chemosensitized by PI-103 but also GBM stem cells. Clinical relevance was further confirmed by the use of primary cultured GBM cells, which also exhibit increased cell death and reduced colony formation on combined treatment with PI-103 and doxorubicin. By identifying class I PI3K inhibitors as powerful agents in enhancing the lethality of DNA-damaging drugs, to which GBMs are usually considered unresponsive, our findings have important implications for the design of rational combination regimens in overcoming the frequent chemoresistance of GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2037270438,"Background Environmental challenges may affect both the exposed individuals and their offspring. We investigated possible adaptive aspects of such cross-generation transmissions, and hypothesized that chronic unpredictable food access would cause chickens to show a more conservative feeding strategy and to be more dominant, and that these adaptations would be transmitted to the offspring. Methodology/Principal Findings Parents were raised in an unpredictable (UL) or in predictable diurnal light rhythm (PL, 12∶12 h light∶dark). In a foraging test, UL birds pecked more at freely available, rather than at hidden and more attractive food, compared to birds from the PL group. Female offspring of UL birds, raised in predictable light conditions without parental contact, showed a similar foraging behavior, differing from offspring of PL birds. Furthermore, adult offspring of UL birds performed more food pecks in a dominance test, showed a higher preference for high energy food, survived better, and were heavier than offspring of PL parents. Using cDNA microarrays, we found that the differential brain gene expression caused by the challenge was mirrored in the offspring. In particular, several immunoglobulin genes seemed to be affected similarly in both UL parents and their offspring. Estradiol levels were significantly higher in egg yolk from UL birds, suggesting one possible mechanism for these effects. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that unpredictable food access caused seemingly adaptive responses in feeding behavior, which may have been transmitted to the offspring by means of epigenetic mechanisms, including regulation of immune genes. This may have prepared the offspring for coping with an unpredictable environment."

Indeed, the only property shared by all fALS SOD1 variants thus far studied is an increased propensity to form proteinaceous aggregates of SOD1, as evidenced in fALS patients (20Shibata N. Hirano A. Kobayashi M. Siddique T. Deng H.X. Hung W.Y. Kato T. Asayama K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 21Shibata N. Asayama K. Hirano A.

Neurobiol. 2008; 85: 94-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and at least 13 fALS mutations in cell culture models. Moreover, proteinaceous SOD1-containing inclusions were also found in a subset of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (20Shibata N. Hirano A. Kobayashi M. Siddique T. Deng H.X. Hung W.Y. Kato T. Asayama K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The sequence of events leading to in vivo aggregation or other abnormal associations involving SOD1 variants, however, is not understood. Amide hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange reactions coupled with proteolysis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) is an increasingly popular method to study protein dynamics. Upon mixing with deuterated buffer, an amide hydrogen of a protein exchanges with a deuterium in the bulk solvent at a rate depending on the dynamic properties of the site (23Englander S.W. Kallenbach N.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16: 521-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The location of deuteriums can be determined by proteolytic digestion followed by mass analysis. Although x-ray crystallography can give a high resolution structure of a protein, it is usually a snapshot of the energy minimum structure. The H/D exchange results can describe the dynamic properties of a protein, although the resolution is limited by the size of peptic fragments (typically 5–20 residues long). The dynamic information of a protein determined by H/D exchange can complement x-ray crystallographic and NMR data to provide a fuller description of the properties of a protein. The objective of this study was to use H/D exchange mass spectrometry to correlate the effects of 13 fALS-causing variants upon SOD1 structure and dynamics. We have chosen variants ranging from fully active to completely inactive including SOD1 A4V, L38V, G41S, H46R, G72Y, D76S, G85R, D90A, G93A, D124V, D125H, E133del, and S134N. Herein we report a structural/dynamic change to the SOD1 electrostatic loop (loop VII) that is common to every fALS variant of the 13 we studied. Moreover, we suggest that this common structural change may contribute to abnormal intermolecular interactions involving SOD1. Because fALS can be caused by changes as simple as the addition of a methyl group (G93A), we chose to study SOD1 from a eukaryotic preparation, assuring N-terminal acetylation. Wild type (WT) SOD1 purified from human erythrocytes was purchased from Sigma and was fully metallated as indicated by native gel electrophoresis and MS of the intact protein. Metal content of the Sigma protein was analyzed by measuring the intact protein mass by performing electrospray ionization-MS out of pure, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade water as described previously (24Taylor D.M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 16329-16335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), affording the ratio of metallated versus apo SOD1. Differences in ionization efficiency of the apo versus metallated SOD1, as well as lower limits for the detection of apo SOD1 were accounted for by converting the metallated SOD1 to apo SOD1 using 0.1% formic acid. By this method, greater than 98% of Sigma SOD1 was judged to contain one copper and one zinc/monomer. All proteins other than Sigma SOD1 were purified as previously described (25Hayward L.J.

WT SOD1 (Sigma) was judged to consist of less than 12% non-native post-translationally modified SOD1, and the most modified fALS-SOD1 variant consisted of less than 30% non-native post-translationally modified proteins. The most prevalent post-translational modifications were +16, +22, and +32 Da, corresponding to SOD1 with one oxygen, one sodium (a common adduct of proteins analyzed by electrospray MS), and two oxygen atoms, respectively. The sites of modification were not determined, although previous studies showed SOD residues Trp32 (24Taylor D.M. Gibbs B.F. Kabashi E. Minotti S. Durham H.D. Agar J.N. J. Biol.

More detailed general procedures of H/D exchange experiments are described elsewhere (29Hamuro Y. Coales S.J. Southern M.R. Nemeth-Cawley J.F. Stranz D.D. Griffin P.R. J. Biomol.

To 3 μl of 1.0 mg/ml SOD1 (in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 150 mm potassium chloride, pH 7.2) was added 17 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (in D2O, pD 7.2), to initiate the exchange reactions, so that H/D exchange took place at 10 μm SOD1 near the in vivo concentration (30Kurobe N. Suzuki F. Okajima K. Kato K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 187: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Yoshida E. Mokuno K. Aoki S. Takahashi A. Riku S. Murayama T. Yanagi T. Kato K. J. Neurol. Sci. 1994; 124: 25-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated at 4 °C for a predetermined time of 15, 50, 150, and 500 s. The reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of 30 μl of cold 2 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 1.4. The quenched solution was digested by passing the sample over an immobilized pepsin column at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The digested peptic fragments were temporarily collected on a reverse phase column (4-μl bed volume), separated by C18 HPLC (Magic C18; Michrom BioResources, Inc., Auburn, CA) with a linear gradient of 13–30% buffer B (buffer A, water with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, buffer B, 95% acetonitrile, and 5% buffer A) in 23 min and detected by a Finnegan LCQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Prior to the H/D exchange experiments, the acidic quenching buffer (the types and concentrations of both denaturant and acid, as well as pH), the flow rate over the pepsin column, and HPLC gradient were optimized to give the best sequence coverage and resolution. Because SOD1 is among the most stable mesotrophic proteins (SOD1 melts at 95 °C and is stable and active in 8 m guanidine HCl or 2% SDS), nonstandard conditions (more acidic quenching and higher capillary temperatures) are required to achieve 100% sequence coverage. These conditions increased back-exchange from our average deuterium recovery of ∼70% to around 57% but are within the range of literature reported values, which vary between 30 and 90%. During the digestion/separation optimization, to quickly identify pepsin-generated peptides for each digestion/separation condition employed, spectral data were acquired in data-dependent MS/MS mode with dynamic exclusion. The SEQUEST (32Yates J.R. Eng J.K. Clauser K.R. Burlingame A.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 7: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) software program (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to identify the sequence of the dynamically selected parent peptide ions. This tentative peptide identification was verified by visual confirmation of the parent ion charge state presumed by the SEQUEST program for each peptide. This set of peptides was then further examined to determine whether the quality of the measured isotopic envelope of peptides was sufficient to allow accurate measurement of the geometric centroid of isotopic envelopes on deuterated samples. We observed qualitatively different digestion patterns for variants L38V and S134N, because residues 23–37 were not observed in L38V digests, and residues 119–132 were not observed in S134N digests. The change in L38V and S134N digestion is attributed to the substitution of an amino acid at pepsin cleavage site residues 37 and 38 and near pepsin cleavage site residues 132–133, respectively. In both cases, longer peptides (residues 23–53 for L38V and residues 119–144 for S134N) were observed, allowing coverage of these regions. To determine the deuteration level of each peptic fragment, control samples of nondeuterated (run without deuterated buffers) and fully deuterated (incubated in 85 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in 85% D2O for 5 h at 60 °C) SOD1 were also analyzed. The centroids of probe peptide isotopic envelopes were measured using an in-house-developed program in collaboration with Sierra Analytics (Mateo, CA). The corrections for back-exchange were made employing methods described previously (33Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), Deuteration level (%)=m(P)-m(N)m(F)-m(N)×100(Eq. 1) Deuterium incorporation (#)=m(P)-m(N)m(F)-m(N)×MaxD(Eq. 2) where m(P), m(N), and m(F) are the centroid values of partially deuterated (on-exchange) peptide, nondeuterated peptide, and fully deuterated peptide, respectively. MaxD is the maximum deuterium incorporation calculated by subtracting the number of prolines in the third or later amino acid and two from the number of amino acids in the peptide of interest (assuming the first two amino acids cannot retain deuteriums (34Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar)). For SOD1, the deuterium recovery of a fully deuterated sample ((m(F) − m(N))/MaxD) was on average 57%. The first two amino acids of a peptide lose deuteriums; therefore no information can be gathered from these residues. Therefore, for example, peptide 7–20 can provide the H/D exchange behaviors of segments 9–20. This causes the gaps seen in Table 1 as well as in Figs. 1 and 3. The exceptions are peptides 1–6 and 1–8. These two peptides provide the information on segments 1–6 and 1–8, respectively, because there is no loss of deuteriums in these peptides because of N-terminal acetylation of the protein.TABLE 1Average deuteration level in each segment of WT SOD1 and average increase in deuteration level in each segment of SOD1 variants at 4 °C and pH 7.2FIGURE 1Pepsin digest coverage map of SOD1.

Formalisms to relate the observed rates of amide H/D exchange to thermodynamic stabilization of proteins have been developed (23Englander S.W. Kallenbach N.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16: 521-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Amide hydrogens of proteins in the native, folded state are proposed to exchange according to the following equation, Closed⇀↽kclkopOpen⇀kchExchanged(Eq. 3) where kop is the rate of “opening,” kcl is the rate of “closing,” and kch is the “intrinsic” or chemical exchange rate as discussed above. In this scheme, the observable exchange rate is given by Equation 4. kex=kop•kch/(kcl+kch)(Eq. 4) For most proteins at or below neutral pH, amide H/D exchange occurs by EX2 mechanism (35Sivaraman T. Arrington C.B. Robertson A.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), where kcl ≫ kch, and Equation 4 becomes Equation 5. kex=kop•kch/kcl=kop•kch(Eq. 5) Assuming that the protein dynamics do not change upon increasing temperature (Kop, constant), kex will be proportional to kch, kch(T)=Ae-Ea/RT(Eq. 6) where Ea = 17.4 kcal/mol for base catalyzed amide hydrogen exchange reactions (34Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 36Hamuro Y. Burns L. Canaves J. Hoffman R. Taylor S. Woods V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This means kch(310 K)=28.5kch(277 K)(Eq. 7) For example, measuring 15, 50, 150, and 500 s at 4 °C is the equivalent of measuring 0.53, 1.8, 5.3, and 18 s at 37 °C. In preliminary experiments we compared the H/D exchange mass spectrometry of SOD1 at 4 °C and at 25 °C and observed no indication of differences in stability at these two temperatures. The deuterium buildup curves at two temperatures overlaid well after using the formula above to normalize the intrinsic exchange. Prior to H/D exchange experiments, the digestion and separation conditions for SOD1 were optimized to generate a set of peptic fragments that cover the entire protein sequence using WT SOD1. The best results were obtained when two parts of diluted SOD1 were quenched with three parts of 2 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 1.4, and digested with an immobilized pepsin column (104 μl, the flow rate over the pepsin column at 200 μl/min) at 1 °C. The separation of digested fragments by reverse phase HPLC and detection by MS generated 58 peptides covering the entire amino acid sequence of SOD1 (Fig. 1). Twenty of the identified peptides, still spanning the entire SOD1 sequence, were of high quality (high signal/noise) and were used for this H/D exchange analysis (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, multiple peptides were often observed for the same region. There are benefits to having peptides from the same regions: 1) a pair of analogous peptides behaving similarly can increase the confidence level of H/D exchange behaviors of the region and 2) a pair of analogous peptides enables the sublocalization of deuteriums. For example, the subtraction of the number of deuteriums in segment 23–37 from that in segment 23–53 provide the number of deuteriums attached in segment 38–53. H/D exchange perturbations of WT SOD1 were determined at 4 °C at pH 7.2 (Figs. 1 and 2, supplemental Fig. S1, and Table 1). A concentration of 10 μm SOD1 was used throughout the H/D exchange experiments to mimic the in vivo concentration of SOD1 (30Kurobe N. Suzuki F. Okajima K. Kato K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 187: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Yoshida E. Mokuno K. Aoki S. Takahashi A. Riku S. Murayama T. Yanagi T. Kato K. J. Neurol. Sci. 1994; 124: 25-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The average deuteration level at each segment was obtained using the deuteration levels at 15, 50, 150, and 500 s. The H/D exchange experiments of both fully metallated and partially metallated copper/zinc WT SOD1 were repeated on three different days, and the standard deviation was typically 2% or less with the exception of the segment containing residues 133–144, whose standard deviation was 5%, suggesting that variation in electrostatic loop structure and dynamics is an intrinsic property of SOD1. None of the segments showed complete deuteration even after 500 s of exchange time, consistent with WT SOD1 being a well folded protein with no disordered regions. The most deuterated segment was residues 133–144 at the electrostatic loop, the structural element that is most distal from the SOD1 dimer interface. Other highly deuterated segments were residues 56–96, which includes the zinc loop, and residues 99–103, which are residues in the β5 strand. In general, the deuteration levels near the dimer interface are relatively low, and those at the edges distal to the dimer interface are relatively high (Fig. 2). Previous studies (25Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) have characterized SOD1 variants in two classes, those with substantial metal binding and superoxide dismutase activities, termed WT-like variants, and those with minimal metal binding and superoxide dismutase activity, termed metal-binding site variants. The H/D exchange perturbations of 13 fALS-related variants including eight WT-like and five metal-binding variants, as well as native (fully metallated) copper/zinc SOD1 and copper-deficient WT SOD1, are illustrated in Fig. 3. Each protein was analyzed at four different time points (15, 50, 150, and 500 s), and the differences shown are relative to fully metallated WT SOD1 purified from human erythrocytes (Table 1, Fig. 3, and supplemental Fig. S2). Based upon the maximum standard deviations among the three independent WT SOD1 deuteration levels of 5% (see above), our cut-off for significant difference among variants was set at a conservative 10%. As a result of this conservative cut-off, we decreased sensitivity to eliminate false positive results. All of the fALS SOD1 variants showed perturbations at residues 133–144 (electrostatic loop) in at least one time point, and with the exception of G93A (which was 9%) the average difference in deuteration levels for all time points was greater than 10% (Table 1). It is striking that the H/D exchange perturbations of the disease-associated variants are similar despite the fact that the mutation sites are distributed across the entire primary structure (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Disruption of the dimer interface elements was only observed for A4V and G85R. The H/D exchange patterns of eight WT-like variants, A4V, L38V, G41S, G72S, D76Y, D90A, G93A, and E133del, were determined (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Most of the WT-like variants showed primarily perturbations at residues 133–144 (electrostatic loop), and some also showed additional perturbations at the adjacent residues 119–132 (electrostatic loop). The exception is A4V, which showed the most pronounced perturbations at the N- and C-terminal residues, 1–8 (β1) and 147–153 (β8), as well as minor perturbations in the electrostatic loop residues 133–144, residues 21–37 (loop II) and 56–96 (the zinc loop and part of β5). The H/D exchange patterns of five metal-binding variants, H46R, G85R, D124V, D125H, and S134N, were determined (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The segments containing residues 56–96 (zinc loop), 119–132 (electrostatic loop), and 133–144 (electrostatic loop) of these variants exchanged significantly faster than those of WT SOD1 (Fig. 3 and Table 1). These three regions were not observed in H46R. G85R showed extra perturbations at segments containing residues 38–53 and 98–103. Fig. 2 illustrates the difference in the average deuteration levels for WT SOD1 and the fALS variant with the most perturbed structure/dynamics, G85R SOD1. The rates of H/D exchange for both the electrostatic and zinc-binding loops were perturbed in all of the metal-binding site variants tested, including G85R, S134N, H46R, D124V, and D125H (Fig. 3). G85R, however, demonstrated an additional increased exchange in loop 3 and β-strand 4 not observed in other variants (Fig. 3). Metal contents for all proteins studied are listed in Table 2. Copper-deficient WT SOD1 and all 13 variants contained less than one molecule of copper/dimer, whereas native WT SOD1 contained about two coppers/dimer. There is little appare"

Even though some aspects of diapause are well investigated, broader scale studies that elucidate the global metabolic adjustments required for this remarkable trait, are rare. In order to better understand the metabolic changes during early insect diapause, we used a shotgun proteomics approach on early diapausing and non-diapausing larvae of the recently sequenced hymenopteran model organism Nasonia vitripennis. Our results deliver insights into the molecular underpinnings of diapause in Nasonia and corroborate previously reported diapause-associated features for invertebrates, such as a diapause-dependent abundance change for heat shock and storage proteins. Furthermore, we observed a diapause-dependent switch in enzymes involved in glycerol synthesis and a vastly changed capacity for protein synthesis and degradation. The abundance of structural proteins and proteins involved in protein synthesis decreased with increasing diapause duration, while the abundance of proteins likely involved in diapause maintenance (e.g. ferritins) increased. Only few potentially diapause-specific proteins were identified suggesting that diapause in Nasonia relies to a large extent on a modulation of pre-existing pathways. Studying a diapause syndrome on a proteomic level rather than isolated pathways or physiological networks, has proven to be an efficient and successful avenue to understand molecular mechanisms involved in diapause."
https://openalex.org/W2011826564,"Background Despite sharing 92% sequence identity, paralogous human translation elongation factor 1 alpha-1 (eEF1A1) and elongation factor 1 alpha-2 (eEF1A2) have different but overlapping functional profiles. This may reflect the differential requirements of the cell-types in which they are expressed and is consistent with complex roles for these proteins that extend beyond delivery of tRNA to the ribosome. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the structural basis of these functional differences, we created and validated comparative three-dimensional (3-D) models of eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 on the basis of the crystal structure of homologous eEF1A from yeast. The spatial location of amino acid residues that vary between the two proteins was thereby pinpointed, and their surface electrostatic and lipophilic properties were compared. None of the variations amongst buried amino acid residues are judged likely to have a major structural effect on the protein fold, or to affect domain-domain interactions. Nearly all the variant surface-exposed amino acid residues lie on one face of the protein, in two proximal but distinct sub-clusters. The result of previously performed mutagenesis in yeast may be interpreted as confirming the importance of one of these clusters in actin-bundling and filament disorganization. Interestingly, some variant residues lie in close proximity to, and in a few cases show differences in interactions with, residues previously inferred to be directly involved in binding GTP/GDP, eEF1Bα and aminoacyl-tRNA. Additional sequence-based predictions, in conjunction with the 3-D models, reveal likely differences in phosphorylation sites that could reconcile some of the functional differences between the two proteins. Conclusions The revelation and putative functional assignment of two distinct sub-clusters on the surface of the protein models should enable rational site-directed mutagenesis, including homologous reverse-substitution experiments, to map surface binding patches onto these proteins. The predicted variant-specific phosphorylation sites also provide a basis for experimental verification by mutagenesis. The models provide a structural framework for interpretation of the resulting functional analysis."

To study the biological function of glycolipid-binding galectins, we purified recombinant Caenorhabditis elegans galectins (LEC-1-11) and studied their binding to C. elegans glycolipids. We found that LEC-8 binds to glycolipids in C. elegans through carbohydrate recognition. It has been reported that Cry5B-producing Bacillus thuringiensis strains can infect C. elegans and that the C. elegans Cry5B receptor molecules are glycolipids. We found that Cry5B and LEC-8 bound to C. elegans glycolipid-coated plates in a dose-dependent manner and that Cry5B binding to glycolipids was inhibited by the addition of LEC-8. LEC-8 is usually expressed strongly in the pharyngeal-intestinal valve and intestinal-rectal valve and is expressed weakly in intestine. However, when C. elegans were fed Escherichia coli expressing Cry5B, intestinal LEC-8::EGFP protein levels increased markedly. In contrast, LEC-8::EGFP expression triggered by Cry5B was reduced in toxin-resistant C. elegans mutants, which had mutations in genes involved in biosynthesis of glycolipids. Moreover, the LEC-8-deficient mutant was more susceptible to Cry5B than wild-type worms. These results suggest that the glycolipid-binding lectin LEC-8 contributes to host defense against bacterial infection by competitive binding to target glycolipid molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2079009954,"In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which the CUX1 transcription factor can stimulate cell migration and invasion. The full-length p200 CUX1 had a weaker effect than the proteolytically processed p110 isoform; moreover, treatments that affect processing similarly impacted cell migration. We conclude that the stimulatory effect of p200 CUX1 is mediated in part, if not entirely, through the generation of p110 CUX1. We established a list of putative transcriptional targets with functions related to cell motility, and we then identified those targets whose expression was directly regulated by CUX1 in a cell line whose migratory potential was strongly stimulated by CUX1. We identified 18 genes whose expression was directly modulated by p110 CUX1, and its binding to all target promoters was validated in independent chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These genes code for regulators of Rho-GTPases, cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion proteins, cytoskeleton-associated proteins, and markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Interestingly, p110 CUX1 activated the expression of genes that promote cell motility and at the same time repressed genes that inhibit this process. Therefore, the role of p110 CUX1 in cell motility involves its functions in both activation and repression of transcription. This was best exemplified in the regulation of the E-cadherin gene. Indeed, we uncovered a regulatory cascade whereby p110 CUX1 binds to the snail and slug gene promoters, activates their expression, and then cooperates with these transcription factors in the repression of the E-cadherin gene, thereby causing disorganization of cell-cell junctions."

Methodology/Principal Findings Based on protein similarities, this highly conserved protein family can be divided into three subfamilies: the Pmt1 sub-family, the Pmt2 sub-family and the Pmt4 sub-family. In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, but similar to filamentous fungi, three putative PMT genes (PMT1, PMT2, and PMT4) were identified in the genome of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Similar to Schizosaccharomyces pombe and C. albicans, C. neoformans PMT2 is an essential gene. In contrast, the pmt1 and pmt4 single mutants are viable; however, the pmt1/pmt4 deletions are synthetically lethal. Mutation of PMT1 and PMT4 resulted in distinct defects in cell morphology and cell integrity. The pmt1 mutant was more susceptible to SDS medium than wild-type strains and the mutant cells were enlarged. The pmt4 mutant grew poorly on high salt medium and demonstrated abnormal septum formation and defects in cell separation. Interestingly, the pmt1 and pmt4 mutants demonstrated variety-specific differences in the levels of susceptibility to osmotic and cell wall stress. Delayed melanin production in the pmt4 mutant was the only alteration of classical virulence-associated phenotypes. However, the pmt1 and pmt4 mutants showed attenuated virulence in a murine inhalation model of cryptococcosis. Conclusion/Significance These findings suggest that C. neoformans protein-O-mannosyltransferases play a crucial role in maintaining cell morphology, and that reduced protein-O-glycosylation leads to alterations in stress resistance, cell wall composition, cell integrity, and survival within the host."

For this purpose, human mammary epithelial cell lines representing normal (MCF-10A), adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and malignant carcinoma (MDA-MB-231) were propagated in 3-dimensional cultures composed of laminin-1, collagen I, or mixtures of the two, and analyzed by Western blot, immunocytochemistry, semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and methylation-specific PCR. Here we demonstrate that laminin-1 decreases methylation of the E-cadherin promoter, resulting in increased mRNA and protein expression for malignant mammary epithelial cells. This decreased methylation is associated with dramatic changes in the cellular and structural morphology as well as a 70-fold decrease in DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and a 6-fold decrease in cadherin 11 protein expression. To control for specificity of laminin-1 interactions, cells were also cultured on 2-dimensional plastic substrata and collagen I hydrogels for analysis, and the MCF-10A and MCF-7 were used as nonmalignant controls. Using a 3-dimensional model, we present evidence that laminin-1 is capable of inducing epigenetic change by inhibiting expression of DNMT1 and preventing methylation of the E-cadherin promoter, resulting in E-cadherin expression and the formation of cell-cell bonds in malignant carcinoma."

Understanding the division of bacteria is also required to find novel antibiotic strategies. Numerous studies, carried out mostly with the model organisms Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis have uncovered several components of the divisome, which can be defined as the ensemble of proteins localized at the division site and participating in the process. Comparison of genomes and deletion studies indicate that the core of the divisome comprises eight conserved, mostly essential proteins: FtsZ, FtsA, FtsK, FtsQ(DivIB), FtsL, FtsB(DivIC), FtsW, and FtsI. Fts nomenclature applies to Gram-negative organisms, whereas Div nomenclature applies to Gram-positive bacteria. These proteins are listed here in the conditional order of their recruitment to the division site of E. coli (1den Blaauwen T. de Pedro M.A. Nguyen-Distèche M. Ayala J.A. FEMS Microbiol.

FtsZ forms polymers with an annular distribution on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and governs the recruitment of the other proteins. FtsA may mediate the interaction of FtsZ with the membrane. FtsK participates to the resolution of chromosome dimers, and possibly to the membrane fission.

In contrast, the roles of FtsQ(DivIB), FtsL, and FtsB(DivIC) have not been firmly linked to any particular process.

Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and reconstituted in vitro with recombinant soluble forms of pneumococcal DivIB, FtsL, and DivIC (11Noirclerc-Savoye M. Le Gouëllec A. Morlot C. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The interaction of the three proteins was also confirmed by yeast and bacterial triple hybrid (12Daniel R.A. Noirot-Gros M.F. Noirot P. Errington J. J.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4501-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The essentiality of ftsQ(divIB) in laboratory conditions varies between species. The gene ftsQ is essential in E. coli (18Carson M.J. Barondess J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2187-2195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but divIB is essential only at high temperatures in B. subtilis (9Katis V.L. Wake R.G. Harry E.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3607-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Beall B. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6821-6834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or in a chemically defined medium in S. pneumoniae (17Le Gouëllec A. Roux L. Fadda D. Massidda O. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4501-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the essentiality of DivIB appears to be a consequence of the protection from proteolysis that it provides to FtsL (8Daniel R.A. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Le Gouëllec A. Roux L. Fadda D. Massidda O. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4501-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). FtsQ(DivIB), FtsL, and FtsB(DivIC) are bitopic membrane proteins with an N-terminal cytoplasmic region, a single transmembrane segment, and an extracytoplasmic region. The extracellular part is necessary and sufficient for the localization and function of FtsQ(DivIB), provided that it is anchored to the membrane (e.g. Refs. 20Guzman L.M. Weiss D.S. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5094-5103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 21Katis V.L. Wake R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2710-2718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), although the transmembrane segment also contributes to the localization (22Scheffers D.J. Robichon C. Haan G.J. den Blaauwen T. Koningstein G. van Bloois E. Beckwith J. Luirink J. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7273-7280Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Wadsworth K.D. Rowland S.L. Harry E.J. King G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The extracellular part is organized in three regions termed α, β, and γ. The crystal structure of a region consisting of the α- and β-domains was solved for FtsQ from E. coli and Yersinia enterocolitica (24van den Ent F. Vinkenvleugel T.M. Ind A. West P. Veprintsev D. Nanninga N. den Blaauwen T. Löwe J. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 110-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The α-domain, comprising about 70 amino acids proximal to the cytoplasmic membrane, corresponds to the POTRA (for polypeptide transport-associated) domain first identified by sequence analysis and proposed to function as a molecular chaperone (25Sánchez-Pulido L. Devos D. Genevrois S. Vicente M. Valencia A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 523-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The α- and β-domains form the conserved region of the FtsQ(DivIB) protein. The γ-region constitutes a C-terminal tail. It is highly variable in length and sequence and predicted to be unfolded. The γ-region was not observed in the structures from E. coli and Y. entercolitica, thus confirming its flexible nature (24van den Ent F. Vinkenvleugel T.M. Ind A. West P. Veprintsev D. Nanninga N. den Blaauwen T. Löwe J. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 110-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The α-domain in the recombinant soluble form of the extracellular part of DivIB from Geobacillus stearothermophilus was digested by trypsin and therefore considered to be largely unfolded (26Robson S.A. King G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6700-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The γ-region was also removed by trypsin digestion, together with a C-terminal fragment of the β-domain. The structure of the resulting shorter β-domain from G. stearothermophilus was solved by NMR (26Robson S.A. King G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6700-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and lacks the two C-terminal β-strands. Localization epitopes have been identified in the transmembrane segment, the α-domain, and a region encompassing the C-terminal part of the β-domain and γ-tail of DivIB from B. subtilis (23Wadsworth K.D. Rowland S.L. Harry E.J. King G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Likewise in E. coli, a region in the α-domain is required for localization of FtsQ, whereas the C-terminal region of the β-domain and the last α-helix are required for recruitment of FtsL and FtsB (24van den Ent F. Vinkenvleugel T.M. Ind A. West P. Veprintsev D. Nanninga N. den Blaauwen T. Löwe J. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 110-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In S. pneumoniae, the essentiality of DivIB in defined medium was found to reside in the C-terminal region of the β-domain (17Le Gouëllec A. Roux L. Fadda D. Massidda O. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 4501-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). No experimental structure is known for FtsL or FtsB(DivIC). Both are small proteins comprising between 90 and 140 amino acids. The number of residues is sometimes larger, as in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (384 for FtsL and 228 for FtsB), due to N- and/or C-terminal extensions consisting of mostly charged and polar amino acids or proline-rich sequences. The major part of FtsL or FtsB(DivIC) is extracellular and contains a region proximal to the transmembrane segment, predicted to form a coiled-coil of about five heptads. Coiled-coil helices associate longitudinally to mediate protein association. It is possible that the coiled-coil helices are continuations of the transmembrane helices, although a proline (known to break helices) is present in some species between the two segments. Following the coiled-coil region is a 25–35-residue long C-terminal region in both FtsL and DivIC(FtsB). This region was recently shown in FtsB to be required for interaction with FtsQ in E. coli (27Gonzalez M.D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 2815-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We report here the results of structural studies in solution of a ternary complex consisting of the β- and γ-segments of DivIB, and a constrained dimer of the extracellular parts of FtsL and DivIC from S. pneumoniae. Despite the coiled-coil predictions, the recombinant extracellular domains of FtsL and DivIC did not interact in vitro (11Noirclerc-Savoye M. Le Gouëllec A. Morlot C. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Robson S.A. Michie K.A. Mackay J.P. Harry E. King G.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Forced dimerization was obtained by fusion with artificial coiled-coil peptides k5 and e5 (35 residues long), which are known to form a heterodimer due to their complementarity of charge, with a nanomolar dissociation constant (29Chao H. Houston Jr., M.E. Grothe S. Kay C.M. O'Connor-McCourt M. Irvin R.T. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12175-12185Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The k5- and e5-coils were fused to the extracellular domain of FtsL and DivIC, to give rise to KL and EC fusion proteins, respectively. The constrained dimer (KL/EC) was shown to interact with the extracellular part of DivIB (DivIBext), yielding a soluble complex amenable to structural studies (11Noirclerc-Savoye M. Le Gouëllec A. Morlot C. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The overall shape of the complex and its constituents was probed using small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) 2The abbreviations used are: SAXSsmall-angle x-ray scatteringSANSsmall-angle neutron scatteringPOTRA domainpolypeptide transport-associated domainTEVtobacco-etched virusGSTglutathione S-transferaseNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPDBProtein data bankHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence. and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). NMR was used to investigate the interface between the proteins by chemical shift mapping. The interaction was further investigated using surface plasmon resonance with truncated forms of the proteins. The complex of DivIB, FtsL, and DivIC is formed by the interaction of one face of the β-domain of DivIB with the C-terminal regions of FtsL and DivIC, at the tip of an elongated rod formed by the coiled-coil segments. The α-domain of DivIB and the coiled-coil regions of FtsL and DivIC remain free to interact with other proteins of the division apparatus. small-angle x-ray scattering small-angle neutron scattering polypeptide transport-associated domain tobacco-etched virus glutathione S-transferase nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Protein data bank heteronuclear single quantum coherence. Proteins were produced in E. coli from expression plasmids inducible with isopropyl β-d-1-thio-galactopyranoside. The sequence encoding DivIBext preceded by the sequence for a tobacco-etched virus protease cleavage site (TEV) was introduced into pGEX-4T1 (GE Healthcare) to produce the fusion protein glutathione S-transferase (GST)-TEV-DivIBext (11Noirclerc-Savoye M. Le Gouëllec A. Morlot C. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The sequence encoding the βγ-fragment (residues 224 to 396) was similarly introduced into pGEX-4T1 to produce GST-TEV-βγ. The sequence encoding the β-domain (residues 224 to 361) following a TEV site was introduced into pLX06 (Protein′eXpert) to produce the fusion protein GST-TEV-β. To produce the KL protein (residues 44 to 105 of FtsL fused following the k5 peptide) with an N-terminal poly-His tag, and a tryptophan to generate absorption at 280 nm, the codon TGG was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the pETduet-based (Novagen) plasmid described previously (11Noirclerc-Savoye M. Le Gouëllec A. Morlot C. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To produce KL* (as KL but ending at residue 82 of FtsL), the stop codon TAG was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. To produce EC (residues 55 to 122 of DivIC fused following the e5 peptide) with an N-terminal Strep tag (IBA), the sequence encoding Strep-EC was amplified from the plasmid described previously encoding a poly-His-tagged EC (11Noirclerc-Savoye M. Le Gouëllec A. Morlot C. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and introduced in pET30 (Novagen). The sequence encoding a poly-His tag followed by a TEV site and EC was similarly introduced into pET30 (Novagen), whereas the sequence encoding a poly-His tag followed by a TEV site and EC* (as EC but ending at residue 93) was introduced into pLIM09 (RoBioMol). A plasmid was also constructed for coexpression of KL and EC by subcloning the sequence encoding the Strep-tagged EC into the pETduet-based plasmid encoding the poly-His-tagged Trp-containing KL. Unlabeled proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) RIL in flasks or in a fermentor (Minifors, Infors) in Luria broth or Terrific broth and the appropriate antibiotic at 37 °C following the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thio-galactopyranoside. For the production of 15N-labeled DivIBext, cells were grown in a fermentor at 28 °C in minimal medium (KH2PO4, 3 g/liter; Na2HPO4, 6 g/liter; NaCl, 0.5 g/liter; MgSO4, 1 mm; FeCl3, 50 μm; CaCl2, 20 μm; MnCl2, 10 μm; ZnSO4, 10 μm; CoCl2, 2 μm; CuCl2, 2 μm; NiCl2, 2 μm; Na2MoO4, 2 μm; H3BO3, 2 μm; biotin, 1 μm; niacinamide, 5 μm; pyridoxine, 5 μm; thiamine, 5 μm; folic acid, 1 μm; riboflavin 1 μm; glucose, 4 g/liter) with 15NH4Cl, 1 g/liter, as nitrogen source. Induction was with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thio-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. For the production of the 15N/2H-labeled β-domain, cells were grown in minimal medium as above in D2O with 15NH4Cl, 1 g/liter, as nitrogen source. For the production of 15N/2H/13C-labeled β-domain, cells were grown as above in D2O with 15NH4Cl, 1 g/liter, and [13C]glucose, 4 g/liter, as nitrogen and carbon sources. DivIBext, β, and βγ were purified in a first step by glutathione affinity chromatography. Cell lysates in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, containing the GST-TEV-DivIBext, GST-TEV-β, or GST-TEV-βγ fusion proteins were loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare). The fusion proteins were cleaved on the resin by incubation at 37 °C with the poly-His-tagged TEV protease and recovered by washing with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl. The TEV protease was then removed by binding on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). This procedure was sufficient for the 15N-DivIBext protein used for recording [15N-1H]HSQC spectra. 15N-2H- and 15N-2H-13C-labeled β-domains were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S75 column (16 × 600 mm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 or 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6, 150 mm NaCl. Further purification steps were also applied before scattering experiments. DivIBext, β, and βγ proteins from the affinity purification were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, to lower the NaCl concentration to 15 mm, prior to loading onto a Resource Q resin (GE Healthcare) and elution with a NaCl gradient from 15 to 500 mm in 10 column volumes. Fractions of interest were pooled and concentrated with Amicon Ultra devices (Millipore) prior to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (10 × 300 mm) (GE Healthcare). Homogenous fractions (as judged by SDS- and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and finally concentrated with Amicon Ultra devices. The protein EC with a Strep-tag was purified from the cell lysate in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl by affinity chromatography on a streptactin resin (IBA). The protein was eluted with 2.5 mm desthiobiotine in the same buffer. The proteins EC, KL, EC*, and KL* with poly-His tags were purified from cell lysates in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). Proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient of 20 to 500 mm in 10 column volumes. The (KL/EC), (KL*/EC), and (KL/EC*) complexes, with both partners harboring poly-His tags, were prepared from proteins purified as described above. The two proteins were mixed in equivalent amounts. Urea was added to reach a concentration of 8 m. The urea was then removed by dialysis three times against 40 volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl. The (KL/EC) complex, where EC has a Strep tag and KL a poly-His tag, was prepared from a lysate of cells co-expressing both proteins. The complex was isolated by two successive steps of affinity chromatography in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, first on Ni-NTA resin eluted with an imidazole gradient from 20 to 500 mm, then on streptactin eluted with 2.5 mm desthiobiotine. Following concentration with an Amicon Ultra device, the complex was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S200 column (16 × 600 mm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm naCl. For the transverse relation optimized spectroscopy NMR experiment, the buffer was exchanged by desalting on a PD10 column (GE Healthcare) against 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7, prior to lyophilization. Protein concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using the following theoretical extinction coefficient: 5500 m−1 cm−1 for poly-His-tagged KL and KL*, 17,420 m−1 cm−1 for Strep-EC, 13,410 m−1 cm−1 for poly-His-tagged EC, 4,470 m−1 cm−1 for poly-His-tagged EC*, 26,360 m−1 cm−1 for DivIBext, 19,858 m−1 cm−1 for βγ, and 11,920 m−1 cm−1 for β. The absorbance spectra were identical without and with 8 m urea indicating that the calculated extinction coefficient could be used without correction. For the KL/EC complex (purified after coexpression of poly-His-tagged KL and Strep-EC) an amino acid analysis gave an experimental extinction coefficient of 24,740 m−1 cm−1, which is 8% larger than the calculated extinction coefficient (22,920 m−1 cm−1); we used the theoretical coefficient. Exploratory heteronuclear NMR data were collected at 27 °C in a 20 mm Tris buffer (90% (v/v) H2O, 10% (v/v) D2O) at pH 8 with 150 mm NaCl, on samples of DivIBext at 140 μm, DivIBext(KL/EC) at 110 μm, and β at 270 μm. Spectra were recorded on a 800 MHz Varian spectrometer equipped with a cold probe. For backbone assignment, a sample of the uniformly 13C/15N-labeled β-domain at 0.8 μm was prepared and data were collected at 27 °C in a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (90% (v/v) H2O, 10% (v/v) D2O) at pH 6 with 150 mm NaCl. A set of high field triple resonance experiments (HNCO, HNCαCO, HNCαCβ, and CβCαCONH) where acquired and assignment was done using the CO, Cα, and Cβ resonances. First assignment was obtained by an automatic approach using MARS (30Jung Y.S. Zweckstetter M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and was then refined manually. The binding of (KL/EC) to the β-domain was studied by transverse relation optimized spectroscopy-type 1H-15N correlation experiments. NMR data were collected at 25 °C with 32 transients and 1024 (1H) × 64 (15N) complex points. A reference spectrum was taken on a 0.4 mm uniformly 13C/15N-labeled deuterated β-domain sample and lyophilized (KL/EC) was added to a concentration of 0.5 mm. The scattered intensities I(Q) were analyzed as a function of the wave vector transfer Q, with Equation 1, Q=(4π/λ)sinθ(Eq. 1) where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ the x-ray or neutron wavelength. The SAXS measurements were performed on the ID02 beamline (ID2 high brilliance beamline) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) at a sample to detector distance of 2 m to cover the Q-range from 0.008 to 0.28 Å−1. The x-ray wavelength was 1 Å and data were collected by a high sensitivity CCD (FReLoN) detector placed in an evacuated flight tube. Solutions were loaded in a flow-through quartz capillary cell (diameter, 2 mm; wall thickness, 10 μm) at 15 °C. The radiation damage was checked with 10 successive exposure times of 0.1 s each on a single part of the sample. Longer exposure time led to damage. Therefore, we acquired and averaged 10 curves of 0.1-s exposure time on different parts of the sample that was pushed through the capillary cell. The two-dimensional diffraction patterns were normalized to an absolute scale and azimuthally averaged to obtain the intensity profiles I(Q), and the solvent background was subtracted using Fit2D. SANS was carried out on the large dynamic range small-angle diffractometer D22 at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). 200-μl Samples in H2O buffers were measured in Hellma® QS 1-mm quartz cells at 4 °C. (Data sets from samples in D2O could not be used due to aggregation problems.) The sample to detector distances were 2 and 8 m with an incident neutron wavelength of 6 Å to cover a Q-range from 0.025 to 0.30 Å−1. The sample and buffer raw two-dimensional intensities (after masking inappropriate data points) were normalized to the incoming neutron flux and corrected for detector efficiency (H2O reference), electronic background (B4C standard), and sample holder scattering (empty quartz cuvette), using RNILS (34Ghosh R. Egelhaaf S.U. Rennie A.R. A Computing Guide for Small-angle Scattering Experiments. Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble2006Google Scholar). Corrected two-dimensional sample and buffer intensities were summed up azimuthally into one-dimensional I(Q) intensities using SPOLLY (34Ghosh R. Egelhaaf S.U. Rennie A.R. A Computing Guide for Small-angle Scattering Experiments. Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble2006Google Scholar). Buffer intensities were then subtracted using PRIMUS (35Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). Molecular masses were determined by SAXS relatively to hen egg white lysozyme using Equation 2, Mr=I(0)/f2C(Eq. 2) where I(0) is the forward scattering and C is the protein concentration in g/liter. The factor ƒ2 = (83 ± 1)10−6 mol L g−2 was determined using hen egg white lysozyme at a concentration of 10.0 g/liter (36Mylonas E. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: S245-S249Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Molecular weights were determined on an absolute scale by SANS using Equation 3 (37Jacrot B. Zaccai G.

We extracted the radii of gyration Rg of all samples by a Guinier analysis using Equation 4 (38Guinier A. Ann. Physiol. 1939; 12: 166-237Google Scholar), ln[I(Q)]=ln[I(O)]-13Rg2Q2(Eq. 4) where I(0) is the intensity scattered in the forward direction. The I(0) and Rg values were extracted by Guinier approximation using the program PRIMUS (35Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). The validity of the approximation was checked a posteriori in each case and was always fulfilled (RgQ(max) < 1).

https://openalex.org/W2022842447,"The tyrosine kinase receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and its ligand, the growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN), are highly expressed during the development of the nervous system and have been implicated in the malignant progression of different tumor types. Here, we describe human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies that target the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in ALK and show the effect in vitro and in vivo. The ALK LBD was used as a bait in a yeast two-hybdrid system to select human scFv from a library with randomized complementarity-determining region 3 domains. Surface plasmon resonance showed high-affinity binding of the selected scFv. The anti-ALK scFv competed for binding of PTN to ALK in intact cells and inhibited PTN-dependent signal transduction through endogenous ALK. Invasion of an intact endothelial cell monolayer by U87MG human glioblastoma cells was inhibited by the anti-ALK scFv. In addition, the growth of established tumor xenografts in mice was reversed after the induction of the conditional expression of the anti-ALK scFv. In archival malignant brain tumors expression levels of ALK and PTN were found elevated and appear correlated with poor patient survival. This suggests a rate-limiting function of the PTN/ALK interaction that may be exploited therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W2088425060,"Intrinsically unstructured domains occur in one-third of all proteins and are characterized by conformational flexibility, protease sensitivity, and the occurrence of multiple phosphorylation. They provide large interfaces for diverse protein-protein interactions. Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an enzyme essential for neuropeptide biosynthesis, is a secretory granule membrane protein. As one of the few proteins spanning the granule membrane, PAM is a candidate to relay information about the status of the granule pool and conditions in the granule lumen. Here, we show that the PAM cytosolic domain is unstructured. Mass spectroscopy and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated phosphorylation at 10–12 sites in the cytosolic domain. Stimulation of exocytosis resulted in coupled phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific sites and in the endoproteolytic release of a soluble, proteasome-sensitive cytosolic domain fragment. Analysis of granule-rich tissues, such as pituitary and heart, showed that a similar fragment was generated endogenously and translocated to the nucleus. This multiply phosphorylated unstructured domain may act as a signaling molecule that relays information from secretory granules to both cytosol and nucleus. Intrinsically unstructured domains occur in one-third of all proteins and are characterized by conformational flexibility, protease sensitivity, and the occurrence of multiple phosphorylation. They provide large interfaces for diverse protein-protein interactions. Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an enzyme essential for neuropeptide biosynthesis, is a secretory granule membrane protein. As one of the few proteins spanning the granule membrane, PAM is a candidate to relay information about the status of the granule pool and conditions in the granule lumen. Here, we show that the PAM cytosolic domain is unstructured. Mass spectroscopy and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated phosphorylation at 10–12 sites in the cytosolic domain. Stimulation of exocytosis resulted in coupled phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific sites and in the endoproteolytic release of a soluble, proteasome-sensitive cytosolic domain fragment. Analysis of granule-rich tissues, such as pituitary and heart, showed that a similar fragment was generated endogenously and translocated to the nucleus. This multiply phosphorylated unstructured domain may act as a signaling molecule that relays information from secretory granules to both cytosol and nucleus. One-third to one-half of all eukaryotic proteins include a disordered region more than 50 amino acids long (1Dunker A.K. Lawson J.D. Brown C.J. Williams R.M. Romero P. Oh J.S. Oldfield C.J.

These intrinsically unstructured domains are characterized by low hydrophobicity and high net charge, features that contribute to their flexibility, low secondary structure, and protease sensitivity (2Tompa P.

Unstructured domains are common in proteins that play key roles in complex pathways like cell cycle regulation, endocytic trafficking, and control of transcription (2Tompa P. Trends Biochem.

Their ability to mediate several low affinity interactions with specific interactors makes them well suited to participation in multistep processes. Intrinsically unstructured domains are often sites of multiple phosphorylation (2Tompa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The presence of an extended unstructured domain may provide a larger interface for protein-protein interactions, with phosphorylation at multiple sites contributing to increased local order, facilitating cooperativity, and driving specific intermolecular interactions (4Lenz P. Swain P.S. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2150-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Identification of phosphorylation sites in the unstructured domains of several proteins and mutational analyses have confirmed their functional significance (5Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q.

Very little is known about the feedback mechanisms that signal the status of the secretory granule pool and regulate recycling. This process involves even greater complexity in neurons where the site of release is distant from the cell body.

Removal of this cytosolic domain limited the access of PAM to secretory granules and eliminated endocytosis (9Tausk F.A. Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Mol.

C-terminal amidation is the final reaction in the generation of many bioactive peptides, and PAM is one of the small number of secretory granule proteins that span the granule membrane and has been shown to be recycled and reused in secretory granules (14Wasmeier C.

Biochemical studies demonstrated that PAM was sensitive to the pH changes that occur as granules mature (16Bell-Parikh L.C. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Biol.

We set out to explore the hypothesis that this key region of PAM was involved in relaying information from the secretory granule lumen. We demonstrate that PAM-CD achieves this by being intrinsically unstructured and acting as a display site for multiple phosphorylation. Mass spectroscopy was used to identify additional sites of phosphorylation, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to demonstrate regulated multiple site phosphorylation in pituitary cells. A newly developed antibody to the C terminus of PAM was used to identify a soluble fragment of PAM-CD (sf-CD). Formed in response to stimulated secretion, sf-CD was identified in nuclei isolated from both heart atrium and pituitary. Production of sf-CD was limited in cells expressing phosphomimetic mutants of PAM. This study demonstrates that the unstructured domain of PAM acts as a signaling module by utilizing multisite phosphorylation, proteolysis, and nuclear translocation. Recombinant PAM-CD was purified from Escherichia coli as described (21Yun H.Y. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with an additional step of purification by reverse phase chromatography on a C-18 μBondapak column (Waters) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a gradient to 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min; purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE was >99%; MALDI-TOF analysis revealed that the purified protein terminated at Ser961. PAM-CD-3P and PAM-CD-5P (residues 896–976) with phosphomimetic Ser to Asp and Thr to Glu mutations at positions 932, 937, and 945 (3P) and also at 946 and 949 (5P) were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in pGEX-6P2 (Amersham Biosciences). Purification was accomplished using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.3 mg/ml). The bound glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were cleaved with PreScission protease (200 μg of protein, 8 units of enzyme, 24 h, 4 °C in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). When expressed as a glutathione S-transferase-PAM-CD fusion protein, purification yielded intact PAM-CD. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded at 20 °C using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD). Purified PAM-CD* (20 μm) in 1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, was used. Spectra were the average of 10 scans acquired using a scan rate of 20 nm/min and a response time of 8 s. The background signal of the buffer was subtracted from the spectra. Protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Stably transfected AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 (22Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J.

Cells were passaged weekly and maintained for less than 20 passages, since changes in phosphorylation pattern and a loss of stimulated secretion were observed in cells maintained in culture for longer times. Anterior pituitary cultures were prepared from ex-pregnant rats as described (15Ferraro F. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25424-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Plastic dishes (12-well) were coated with protamine and NuSerum. Dissociated cells (1 pituitary/well) were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen or Mediatech) containing 25 mm HEPES, 10% NuSerum, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 μm cytosine arabinoside. The next day, the serum-containing medium was replaced with complete serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1), 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, penicillin/streptomycin, insulin/transferrin/selenium, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) and cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) and maintained in this medium until harvesting. Cells were maintained for a total of 3 days in vitro. PAM-1 AtT-20 cells and anterior pituitary cultures were rinsed with complete serum-free medium prior to stimulation with complete serum-free medium containing 1 μm phorbol myristate acetate along with 12.5 nm calyculin A (Sigma) for 1 h and, when indicated, 2 μm MG132 (Sigma) for 3 h. Myc-TMD-CD cells were also treated with 0.5 mm cyclic 8-bromo-AMP for 1 h. Cells were extracted with 20 mm NaTES, 10 mm mannitol (TM; pH 7.4), 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA at 4 °C containing protease inhibitors (0.3 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 16 μg/ml benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin), 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 12.5 nm calyculin A. Extracts were passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris and nuclei. Membranes were prepared by centrifugation at 430,000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were resuspended in TM with 1% Triton X-100 (Pierce SurfActs), pH 7.4 (TMT), allowed to tumble at 4 °C for 30 min, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (Pierce), and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (15Ferraro F. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25424-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Where indicated, membrane protein extracts (150 μg) were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP; 30 units; New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 20 min in 0.5% TMT, 10 mm MgCl2 with protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitated PAM-1 prepared from AtT-20 extracts received a second addition of CIP and an additional 20-min incubation. Solubilized membrane proteins were precipitated with two volumes of 100% ethanol at −20 °C overnight. The protein pellet obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C was resuspended in 10 μl of 2% ASB-14 in TM (Sigma) and sonicated. Rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% ASB-14, 0.5% ampholytes 4–7 (Invitrogen), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.001% bromphenol blue) was added and mixed for 1 h at room temperature. The sample was loaded into Zoom IPGRunner cassettes (Invitrogen), and an ImmobilineTM Dry Strip pH 4–7 isoelectric focusing gel (IPG) (Amersham Biosciences) was placed into the well. Rehydration of IPG strips was carried out overnight, after which the strips were transferred to IPGPhor coffins. Isoelectric focusing was carried out at 20 °C using an IPGPhor electrophoresis unit (Amersham Biosciences) as follows: 200 V, 30 min; 500 V, 30 min; 1000 V, 30 min; ramp to 4000 V over 30 min; 4000 V for 12,000 V-h). After focusing, the IPG strip was incubated for 15 min with 1% dithiothreitol in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS), followed by a 15-min alkylation with 2% iodoacetamide in equilibration buffer. IPG strips were then placed into the IPG wells of 4–20% Zoom gels (Invitrogen) and sealed in place with 0.5% agarose with bromphenol blue to be fractionated. After fractionation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). To reprobe with a different antibody, membranes were stripped by incubation at 50 °C for 30 min in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS containing 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol. PAM-1 was visualized using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (JH629) to Exon A (rPAM-1-(394–498)); this antibody recognizes both PHM and PAL produced from PAM-1 (11Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T.

A polyclonal antibody (C-stop) to the final 12 residues of PAM was raised by immunizing rabbits with the Cys-extended peptide (Cys-Y965SAPLPKPAPSS976) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Covance); following ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis, C-stop antibody was affinity-purified using AffiGel 10 (Bio-Rad) resin conjugated to peptide antigen. Actin was immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody (JLA20) from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa). Polyclonal antibody to histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) was used to identify nuclear fractions. Immunoblots of two-dimensional gels were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Where indicated, membranes were cut above the 25 kDa marker; the two pieces were incubated separately with the same stock of C-stop and second antibody to eliminate any possibility of competition for limited amounts of antibody and to allow the use of different exposure times. Membrane extracts prepared from AtT-20 cell lines overexpressing PAM-1 or Myc-TMD-CD were immunoprecipitated with Exon A or C-stop polyclonal antibody using Protein A beads (200 μg of membrane protein). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 or GelCode Blue (Pierce), and the band of interest was excised for mass spectrometric analysis. Gel pieces were processed for in situ enzymatic digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C or chymotrypsin (24Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Curr. Protocols Protein Sci. 2004; : 11.3Google Scholar), followed by separation into flow-through and titanium dioxide-bound fractions. TiO2 Top Tips (Glygen Corp.) were washed with 40 μl of 100% acetonitrile, followed by 0.2 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and then by 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile. The acidified digest was spun onto the TopTip (1000 rpm for 1 min and then 3000 rpm for 2 min) prior to a 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile (40 μl) wash to generate the flow-through fraction. Phosphopeptides were eluted using 3 × 30 μl of 28% NH4OH. Both fractions were dried prior to dissolving in 3 μl of 70% formic acid and dilution with 7 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis (5 μl injected) was performed on a Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap XL equipped with a Waters nanoAcquity (25Stone K.L. Crawford M. McMurray W. Williams N. Williams K.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 386: 57-77PubMed Google Scholar). MS/MS and MS3 spectra were obtained utilizing neutral loss (32.7 triply, 49 doubly, and 98 singly charged). Spectra were analyzed using the Mascot algorithm (26Hirosawa M. Hoshida M. Ishikawa M. Toya T. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar) along with manual verification of the sequence. Cardiomyocyte and pituitary nuclei were purified from tissue taken from adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (27Boheler K.R. Chassagne C. Martin X. Wisnewsky C. Schwartz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12979-12985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue rinsed with L-15 medium was suspended in 10–15 volumes of MA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose) with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors. Tissue was homogenized for 10–12 s with a Polytron homogenizer at setting 4 (homogenate), followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of MA buffer, further homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer (6 strokes), and filtered through a nylon membrane (pore size 70 μm); the supernatant (S1) was retained for analysis. The filtrate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in MA buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100; the supernatant (S2) was retained for analysis. After centrifugation as above, the pellet was resuspended in 800 μl of MB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.2 m sucrose) with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture. Resuspended nuclei (gradient input) were layered onto a 1.4-ml layer of 2.4 m sucrose in MB buffer and centrifuged for 2 h at 86,000 × gavg in a TLS55 rotor in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. All but 200 μl of buffer covering the white pellet at the bottom of the tube was removed; the remainder was diluted with 4 volumes of MA buffer so that nuclei could be pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the white nuclear pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of MA buffer. Freshly isolated nuclei were fixed in 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C, and aliquots were placed onto polylysine-coated coverslips as described (28Yao I. Iida J. Nishimura W. Hata Y. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5354-5364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After rinsing with PBS, nuclei were permeabilized with 0.075% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and blocked with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Fixed nuclei were incubated with affinity-purified C-stop antibody (1:200) diluted in blocking buffer overnight. Specificity was confirmed by preblocking the antibody with antigenic peptide (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature prior to immunostaining. Following extensive rinsing with PBS, nuclei were incubated in Cy3-conjugated second antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. TOPRO3 (1:500 in PBS for 30 min) was used to identify nuclei. Coverslips were mounted on slides using Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was performed in the Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope (Thornwood, NY). The cytosolic domain of PAM, although not as well conserved as its catalytic cores, is more highly conserved than its signal sequence or transmembrane domain (29Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Basic residues predominate near the transmembrane domain, with the K893KSR sequence meeting the criteria for a monopartite nuclear localization signal (30Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5101-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar); acidic residues are prevalent near the C terminus (Fig. 1A). Of the 15 Ser/Thr residues in rat PAM-CD, Disphos (Disorder-enhanced Phosphorylation Predictor) (available on the World Wide Web) identifies 11 as likely phosphorylation sites (probability score of >0.5) (Fig. 1A). The five sites previously identified by in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant PAM-CD using purified protein kinase C, protein kinase A, casein kinase 2, and P-CIP2 bring the total number of sites to be considered to 13 (11Yun H.Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Caldwell B.D. Darlington D.N. Penzes P. Johnson R.C.

Mean hydrophobicity and mean net charge can be used to predict regions expected to have a natively unfolded structure (32Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). When applied to PAM, the catalytic cores (PHM and PAL), along with its single transmembrane domain, fell into the folded category (Fig. 1B). In contrast, both PAM-CD and the region between PHM and PAL (Exon A) fell into the natively unfolded category. IUPRED, a Web server that predicts intrinsically unstructured regions in proteins, also predicts PAM-CD to be intrinsically unstructured (33Dosztányi Z. Csizmok V. Tompa P. Simon I. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3433-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Recombinant PAM-CD purified from bacterial lysates was used to test this prediction. Consistent with the protease sensitivity expected of natively unfolded proteins, MALDI-TOF analysis indicated that PAM-CD purified from bacteria expressing rat PAM-1-(898–976) terminated at Ser961. Antibody directed to the C terminus of PAM (-Ser976) confirmed the absence of this epitope, and this C-terminally truncated fragment of PAM-CD is here referred to as PAM-CD*. The secondary structure of purified PAM-CD* was analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Fig. 1C). The spectrum obtained, with its negative peak at 200 nm, indicated that PAM-CD* was largely a random coil at pH 7.4. NMR studies of purified 15N-labeled PAM-CD were consistent with this conclusion (data not shown). Antisera specific for the protein kinase C site in PAM-CD, Ser(P)937, and for the P-CIP2 or Casein Kinase 2 site, Ser(P)949, were used to compare PAM phosphorylation in AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells and primary pituitary cells. In both systems, stimulated exocytosis evoked by treatment with the secretagogue phorbol myristate acetate (phorbol ester) was necessary before phosphorylation of Ser937 was detectable (Fig. 2, A and B). Although calyculin A alone was without effect, inclusion of this inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in phorbol ester-stimulated cultures increased levels of Ser(P)937 in PAM-1 AtT-20 cells and in primary cultures. In primary pituitary cells, Ser(P)937 was detected in PAM-1, PAM-2 (an alternatively spliced isoform that lacks exon A), and PALm (Fig. 2B, right). Although inclusion of a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) increased Ser(P)937 levels in AtT-20 cells, it did not do so in pituitary cells. When the same samples were examined using antibody specific for Ser(P)949, a site phosphorylated by P-CIP2 and by casein kinase 2, basal phosphorylation was apparent in both AtT-20 cells and primary pituitary cells (Fig. 2). Neither stimulation with phorbol ester nor the addition of calyculin A had any effect on the level of phosphorylation at this site. Although PAM-2 is more prevalent than PAM-1 in rat pituitary, it was barely detected by the Ser(P)949-specific antibody, revealing the occurrence of isoform-specific phosphorylation. This simple analysis of factors affecting phosphorylation at these two sites revealed rapid turnover and site-specific regulation, validating the use of stably transfected AtT-20 cells as a model for pituitary endocrine cells. To identify phosphorylation sites in PAM, membranes were prepared from AtT-20 cell lines stably expressing PAM-1 or its Myc-tagged transmembrane/cytosolic domain (Myc-TMD-CD). To facilitate i"
https://openalex.org/W2110607828,"Decoding the complexity of multicellular organisms requires analytical procedures to overcome the limitations of averaged measurements of cell populations, which obscure inherent cell-cell heterogeneity and restrict the ability to distinguish between the responses of individual cells within a sample. For example, defining the timing, magnitude and the coordination of cytokine responses in single cells is critical for understanding the development of effective immunity. While approaches to measure gene expression from single cells have been reported, the absolute performance of these techniques has been difficult to assess, which likely has limited their wider application. We describe a straightforward method for simultaneously measuring the expression of multiple genes in a multitude of single-cell samples using flow cytometry, parallel cDNA synthesis, and quantification by real-time PCR. We thoroughly assess the performance of the technique using mRNA and DNA standards and cell samples, and demonstrate a detection sensitivity of ∼30 mRNA molecules per cell, and a fractional error of 15%. Using this method, we expose unexpected heterogeneity in the expression of 5 immune-related genes in sets of single macrophages activated by different microbial stimuli. Further, our analyses reveal that the expression of one ‘pro-inflammatory’ cytokine is not predictive of the expression of another ‘pro-inflammatory’ cytokine within the same cell. These findings demonstrate that single-cell approaches are essential for studying coordinated gene expression in cell populations, and this generic and easy-to-use quantitative method is applicable in other areas in biology aimed at understanding the regulation of cellular responses."

Previously we found that the histone H2A-like TAF paralogs TAF4 and TAF4b possess DNA-binding activity. Whether TAF4/TAF4b DNA binding directs TFIID to a specific core promoter element or facilitates TFIID binding to established core promoter elements is not known. Here we analyzed the mode of TAF4b·TAF12 DNA binding and show that this complex binds DNA with high affinity. The DNA length required for optimal binding is ∼70 bp. Although the complex displays a weak sequence preference, the nucleotide composition is less important than the length of the DNA for high affinity binding. Comparative expression profiling of wild-type and a DNA-binding mutant of TAF4 revealed common core promoter features in the down-regulated genes that include a TATA-box and an Initiator. Further examination of the PEL98 gene from this group showed diminished Initiator activity and TFIID occupancy in TAF4 DNA-binding mutant cells.

Two types of DNA elements regulate transcription of protein-encoding genes in eukaryotes.

The major core promoter-binding factor within the general transcription apparatus is TFIID, a large complex composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and about 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (for recent reviews see Refs. 3Smale S.T.

The TAFs are also important for core promoter recognition, and they bind primarily to non-TATA-box elements, interacting with sequences upstream and downstream to the TATA box (5Sawadogo M.

In addition certain TAF sub-complexes have been reported to specifically bind different core promoter elements. The TAF1·TAF2 complex binds to the Initiator element (14Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and Drosophila TAF6 and TAF9 cross-linked to the downstream promoter element in the context of TFIID (15Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and, as a reconstituted complex, these were shown to associate with a downstream promoter element-containing promoter (16Shao H. Revach M. Moshonov S. Tzuman Y. Gazit K. Albeck S. Unger T. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A feature common to 9 of the 14 TAFs is the histone-fold domain (HFD) (17Hoffmann A. Chiang C.M. Oelgeschlager T. Xie X. Burley S.K. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G.

Nature. 1996; 380: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The presence of histone-fold TAFs within TFIID led to the proposal that there is a nucleosomal-like interaction between HFD TAFs and DNA (21Hoffmann A. Oelgeschlager T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 8928-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently we reported that the H4-H3-like TAF6 and TAF9 have intrinsic DNA-binding activity that lies outside the HFD. However, when complexed through their HFDs, they show enhanced DNA-binding activity to the core promoter motif downstream promoter element (16Shao H. Revach M. Moshonov S. Tzuman Y. Gazit K. Albeck S. Unger T. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We also found that human, Drosophila, and yeast TAF4 is capable of DNA binding, which we mapped to its H2A-like histone-fold motif and a unique spacer domain that is not present in histone H2A. The interaction of the H2A-like TAF4b with the H2B-like TAF12 increased the stability of the DNA-bound complex (16Shao H. Revach M. Moshonov S. Tzuman Y. Gazit K. Albeck S. Unger T. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The ability of many TAFs to bind DNA suggests that they facilitate core promoter binding by TFIID. How TAF4/TAF4b·TAF12 accomplishes this is unknown. In the present study we report on the unique biochemical and molecular features of the interaction of the histone-like pair TAF4b·TAF12 with DNA. We show that it binds DNA with high affinity most likely through one TAF4b·TAF12 heterodimer forming several contacts with one DNA molecule. For optimal binding the complex requires the DNA to have a length of ∼70 bp. The complex displays a weak sequence preference for the adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter, but the nucleotide composition of the DNA is less important than its length for high affinity binding. Expression profiling revealed a gene set that is down-regulated when TAF4 DNA binding is impaired. The vast majority of genes in this group have an Initiator core promoter element around the TSS and a high prevalence of the TATA-box. Examination of the Pel98 promoter from this group demonstrated that TAF4 DNA binding was critical for the core promoter function. Our findings suggest that, in this subset of genes, TAF4 can facilitate the binding of TFIID to the core promoter by providing additional contacts with DNA. TAF4b and TAF12 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 DE3 strain, refolded either alone or as complexes, and then purified as previously described (16Shao H. Revach M. Moshonov S. Tzuman Y. Gazit K. Albeck S. Unger T. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and further purified on a Sephadex 200 column. TAF4CRII and TAF4CRIImDB were expressed and refolded as previously described (16Shao H. Revach M. Moshonov S. Tzuman Y. Gazit K. Albeck S. Unger T. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For EMSA DNA was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and polynucleotide kinase. The DNA probe (4 ng) was incubated with the TAF4b·TAF12 complex in a 20-μl reaction volume in DNA binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 for 20 min at 25 °C. The samples were loaded onto a 5% native polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) and run at 4 °C for 2 h. The gel was dried and visualized using a phosphorimaging device (Fuji BAS 2500). For DNA cellulose binding assays the proteins were incubated with either empty cellulose beads or DNA-containing cellulose beads (0.25 μg of double-stranded calf thymus DNA (Sigma) per reaction) for 45 min, at room temperature, in binding buffer composed of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 15% glycerol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 30 μl of binding buffer containing 1 m NaCl. 20% of the eluted bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Mass spectrometry was performed under non-denaturing conditions on a QToF Q-Star XL (MDS Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada) mass spectrometer, modified for improved transmission of large, non-covalent complexes. The instrument was fitted with a high m/z quadrupole. In addition, the pressure regime in the early vacuum stage of the instrument was modulated to improve large ion transmission, by a flow-restricting sleeve surrounding part of the first quadrupole ion guide of the Sciex instrument (Chernushevich IV, Thomson BA; collisional cooling of large ions in electrospray mass spectrometry). Construction of pGEX-TAF4CRII was previously described (Shao et al. 16Shao H. Revach M. Moshonov S. Tzuman Y. Gazit K. Albeck S. Unger T. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To construct the pGEX-TAF4CRIImDB two DNA fragments corresponding to TAF4 amino acids 828–1010 and 1052–1083 (end) were generated by PCR and sequentially inserted into pGEX-2TK. To generate expression plasmids for HA-tagged TAF4CRII and TAF4CRIImDB, DNAs encoding TAF4CRII and TAF4CRIImDB were amplified from the pGEX-TAF4CRII and pGEX-TAF4CRIImDB plasmids, respectively, by PCR with the oligonucleotides 5′-CCCCCCTCTAGAGACGATGATGACATTAATGA and 5′-GGGGGGGGATCCCCGGGAGCTGCATGTGTCAGAGG, and the fragments were first cloned into the pCGN expression vector downstream to the HA-epitope. The pCGN was then cut with SnaBI and EcoRI to generate DNA fragments that included TAF4CRII and TAF4CRIImDB with the HA tag in their N-terminal, and these fragments were cloned into pEIRES-P at NheI that was blunted by Klenow and EcoRI. The PEL98 promoter from −488 to +10 was amplified by PCR from mouse genomic DNA using primers 5′-CCCCCCGGTACCCCAAGGTCCCTCCTGACTTG and 5′-CCCCCCCTCGAGAGAGAGGTTTGGGGAGAGCC and cloned into the promoter-less reporter gene pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) at the KpnI and XhoI sites of the multiple cloning site. The Initiator mutant was generated by PCR using the same forward primer and the reverse primer 5′-CCCCCCCTCGAGAGAGAGCACACCGGAGAGCC. TAF4−/− cells, and their derivatives were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. TAF4CRII and TAF4CRIImDB expression plasmids were transfected into the TAF4−/− fibroblasts, and stable clones were picked out following puromycin selection. Poly-l-lysine-coated glass microarrays containing >23,000 different probes (mouse oligonucleotide set, Compugen) were purchased from the Center for Applied Genomics, New Jersey. The microarrays were probed with a mixture of cyanine 3- or cyanine 5-labeled cDNAs, generated from total RNA (100 μg) that was prepared from TAF4CRII and TAF4CRIImDB cell lines. The cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) with aminoallyl-modified dUTP nucleotide (Ambion) at a 4:1 aminoallyl-modified dUTP-to-dTTP ratio and labeled with an N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated cyanine 3 or cyanine 5 fluorescent probe (Amersham Biosciences) through aminoallyl-modified dUTP. These labeled cDNAs from TAF4CRII and TAF4CRIImDB cells were mixed with equivalent amounts of fluorescent dye (100 pmol each) in 2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.08% SDS, 6 μl of blocking solution (Amersham Biosciences), and water to 100 μl. This target mixture was denatured at 95 °C for 3 min, chilled, and applied between a raised coverslip (LifterSlip, Erie Scientific Co.) and the array. The slide was then sealed in a microarray hybridization chamber and submerged in a darkened water bath set at 55 °C for hybridization. After 12 h, the slide was washed for 5 min in 2× SSC-0.5% SDS at 55 °C, 5 min in 0.5× SSC at room temperature, and 5 min in 0.05× SSC at room temperature. It was then quickly dried by centrifuging for 3 min at 1000 rpm and stored in the dark until scanned. Each cell line was represented by dye-swap microarray replicates. To correct for dye bias Lowess normalization was performed. Bad spots were flagged out before normalization. Average log intensities were calculated using the R package Limma (22Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 3 (Article3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (8979) Google Scholar). Linear models and empirical Bayes methods were used for assessing differential expression in microarray experiments. All genes with <1.9-fold changes were excluded from the list. Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA preparations were treated with RQ1 DNase I (Promega) to avoid contamination by genomic DNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using an oligo(dT)15 primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 1 μl of a 1/50 cDNA dilution was used for PCR. The real-time PCR was performed in 20-μl tubes using a SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions in a 7300 real-time PCR system and was analyzed using 7300 system software. The oligonucleotides used for real-time PCR were as follows: β-actin, 5′-CCCTAAGGCCAACCGTGAA and 5′-TTGAAGGTCTCAAACATGATCTGG; mouse THBS1, 5′-CCATGAAGAGTTCCTTGGGTTT and 5′-TCTGGCTCTGTGAGTAAGGCAG; CYR61, 5′-TCAGGGACTAAGTGCCTCCAG and 5′-GCAAGGCACCATTCATCCTC; FGF7, 5′-AGGTCATGCTTCCACCTCGT and 5′-GGGCTGGAACAGTTCACACTC; SFRP2, 5′-TCCCAGTGGGTGGCTTCTC and 5′-TAGCTTTCCCGGACTGTGCTT; PEL98, 5′-AGCTGCATTCCAGAAGGTGA and 5′-ACATCATGGCAATGCAGGAC; OMD, 5′-TTCAGACACTCCAGAAGAGGGAG and 5′-CGACTGCTCTTCCGAAGGTC; MSLN, 5′-GAATGGCTGCAACACATCTCC and 5′-GTCGGAACCTTGGGTGTATGA; and IL1RL1, 5′-GAATGGGACTTTGGGCTTTG and 5′-CAGGACGATTTACTGCCCTCC. Transfections into TAF4CRII and TAF4CRIImDB cell lines were performed using the jetPEI transfection reagent (PolyPlus Transfection) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reporter assays, subconfluent cells were transfected in a 6-well plate using 1000 ng of the firefly luciferase reporter vector, 50 ng of Rous sarcoma virus-Renilla control reporter vector (containing Renilla luciferase), and 50 ng of cytomegalovirus-green fluorescent protein. 4 h after transfection the medium was replaced. 24 h after transfection luciferase and Renilla activities were measured. ChIP assays were carried out as described (23Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of cross-linked chromatin extract were used for immunoprecipitation. The input and the ChIP data were quantified by densitometric analysis using Quantity One one-dimensional analysis software (Bio-Rad), and the ChIP results were normalized to the input and the enrichment relative to the control antibodies was calculated. The ChIP primers were: PMM2 core promoter (forward, 5′-ACCGGTGTTCTGTGAACCAT; reverse, 5′-CCATCCATGTCGAAGAGACA), PEL98 promoter (forward, 5′-GCAAGAGCACAGTATCCATG; reverse, 5′-AGCAGTGCTATCAGACCAAC), and PEL98–1000 bp promoter upstream region (forward, 5′-CCTTTATGCTCCTTACTACTG; reverse, 5′-GTCTCATCTGATAGGACACG). Different promoter fragments were generated by PCR using the primers as follows: IκB (forward, 5′-TCTGGTCTGACTGGCTTGG; reverse, 5′-GGACTGCTGTGGGCTCTG) and A20 (forward, 5-GAAATCCCCGGGCCTACAAC; reverse, 5-CAAGCTCGCTTGGCCCGCC). The template for the control fragment was the pTZ57R plasmid (forward, 5′-GACTCACTATAGGGAAAGCTTGC; reverse, 5-CGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGC). For the AdML promoter the primers were: forward, 5′-GTGACCGGGTGTTCCTGAAGGGGGGC; reverse, 5′-CCATGATTACGCCAAGCTTGCATG; the AdML promoter was generated by PCR and then digested with ApaI restriction enzyme to get the 74-bp fragment containing the core promoter. In other experiments the AdML core promoter was generated by annealing two oligonucleotides and filling in with Klenow. Primers were forward, 5′-GTGACCGGGTGTTCCTGAAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGGGGC; reverse, 5-CGGAAGAGAGTGAGGACGAACGCGCCCCCACCCCCTTTTATAGCC. The AdML promoter derivatives were generated by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides with the following sequences: AdML Δ5′ (forward, 5′-GTTCCTGAAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGGGGCGCGTT; reverse, 5-CGGAAGAGAGTGAGGACGAACGCGCCCCCACCCCCTTTTATAGCC), AdML Δ3′ (forward, 5′-GTGACCGGGTGTTCCTGAAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGGGGC; reverse, 5′-AACGCGCCCCCACCCCCTTTTATAGCCCCCCTTCAGGAAC), AdML Δ5′+Δ3′ (forward, 5-GTTCCTGAAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGGGGCGCGTT; reverse, 5-AACGCGCCCCCACCCCCTTTTATAGCCCCCCTTCAGGAAC), AdML 5′ mutant (forward, 5′-TGTCAATTTGGTTCCTGAAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGGGGC; reverse, 5′-CGGAAGAGAGTGAGGACGAACGCGCCCCCACCCCCTTTTATAGCC), AdML 3′-1 mutant (forward, 5′-GTGACCGGGTGTTCCTGAAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGGGGC; reverse, 5′-ATTCCTCTAGTGAGGACGAACGCGCCCCCACCCCCTTTTATAGCC), and AdML 3′-2 mutant (forward, 5′-GTGACCGGGTGTTCCTGAAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGGGGC; reverse, 5′-CGGAAGAGCTGTCTTCCGAACGCGCCCCCACCCCCTTTTATAGCC). The H2A-like TAF4 and TAF4b interact with the H2B-like TAF12 in vitro and in native TFIID. Both TAF4/4b and TAF12 possess intrinsic DNA-binding activity, and their interaction through the HFD is important for stable DNA binding (16Shao H. Revach M. Moshonov S. Tzuman Y. Gazit K. Albeck S. Unger T. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To characterize TAF4b·TAF12 DNA binding further we first determined the composition of the TAF4b·TAF12 complex. When the TAF4b C-terminal DNA-binding domain (amino acids 561–769) and His6-TAF12 are either co-expressed in E. coli or expressed separately and then combined and purified on nickel beads, they co-purify, indicating complex formation (Fig. 1A). The TAF4b·TAF12 complex was loaded onto a Sephadex 200 gel filtration column, and it eluted in a single peak. The presence of TAF4b and TAF12 in the peak fraction was verified by mass spectrometry (data not shown). We performed a special mass spectrometric analysis to elucidate the oligomeric state of the TAF4b·TAF12 complex (24Sharon M. Robinson C.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This technique preserves non-covalent interactions between proteins, allowing determination of the molecular mass of the complex and the subunits ratio. The measured mass of the TAF4b·TAF12 complex was 41,233 ± 11 Da corresponding to a 1:1 stoichiometry between TAF4b and TAF12 (supplemental Fig. S1). To confirm the composition of the complex, tandem mass spectrometry experiments were conducted. The complex dissociates into two subunits with measured masses of 23,367 ± 2 and 17,794 ± 1 Da, which is in close agreement with the calculated masses of TAF4b and TAF12, respectively, without their first methionine (supplemental Fig. S1). This experiment confirms that TAF4b and TAF12 form a stable complex and suggests that the complex consists of a heterodimer. To examine the DNA-binding activity of this complex we employed the EMSA in which the ratio of DNA to TAF4b·TAF12 dimer was gradually increased up to 1:2 (Fig. 1B). The DNA used in this experiment is the AdML promoter that binds TAF4b·TAF12 preferentially (see below). Under conditions of excess protein, formation of the DNA·protein complex is inefficient and unstable, because it tends to dissociate during electrophoresis (lane 1). However, the complex becomes increasingly stable with increased DNA levels (lanes 2–7). When the DNA is in excess the complex remains stable and competition is observed (see Figs. 2B and 3A). The observation that the TAF4b·TAF12-DNA complex becomes more efficient and stable at a high DNA:protein ratio (compare lanes 4 to 5, Fig. 1B) raises the possibility that there are several points of contacts between TAF4b·TAF12 and the DNA. In a large excess of TAF4b·TAF12 some of these contacts are competed out and the complex becomes less stable.FIGURE 3The optimal length of DNA for TAF4b·TAF12 binding is half the size of nucleosomal DNA. A, the TAF4b·TAF12 complex was incubated with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing a 70-bp AdML promoter (WT) in the absence (lane 2) or the presence (lanes 3–10) of cold DNA competitors as indicated at the top of the lanes. The sequences of the DNA used as competitors are shown below. B, EMSA experiment as in A using equivalent molar amounts of different length DNAs whose sequences are shown in A.

To examine whether TAF4b·TAF12 binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner we examined the binding of the purified recombinant TAF4b·TAF12 complex to four different DNA fragments of 74- to 105-bp length (Fig. 2A). The first fragment, A20, is the core promoter of a gene regulated by TAF4b (25Yamit-Hezi A. Nir S. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Two others are the AdML and the IκB gene core promoters, and the last is a control DNA derived from a plasmid with no promoter sequences. We tested the binding of the TAF4b·TAF12 complex to these four DNA fragments with EMSA. Using labeled AdML DNA we examined the affinity of TAF4b·TAF12 to each of the DNA fragments by competition with an excess of unlabeled fragments (Fig. 2B). The experiment revealed differences in the ability of the fragments to compete with AdML suggesting that TAF4b·TAF12 discriminates between the different sequences. The AdML promoter had the highest affinity to the complex followed by IκB. The results were verified by reciprocal experiments in which either the A20 (Fig. 2C) or the IκB (data not shown) promoters were labeled. Enzymatic and chemical footprinting assays of the AdML promoter failed to reveal a specific DNA sequence bound by the complex indicating that the sequence preference is weak. The observation that the affinity for the A20 core promoter derived from a gene regulated by TAF4b was the lowest is surprising. In activating A20 transcription TAF4b serves as coactivator for NF-κB, an activity that requires direct interaction between TAF4b and NF-κB (25Yamit-Hezi A. Nir S. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Silkov A. Wolstein O. Shachar I. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17821-17829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the DNA binding and coactivation functions of TAF4b are independent of each other. We extended the characterization of TAF4b·TAF12 binding to the AdML promoter with a competition experiment between the AdML core promoter probe and an excess of cold DNAs, either the wild-type AdML core promoter or mutants in which the upstream or downstream segments or both were deleted (Fig. 3A). In this experiment we observed differences between the mutants for competition with the labeled 70-bp AdML promoter. The central 40-bp region lacking both the upstream and the downstream ends was the least effective competitor (compare lanes 3 and 4 to lanes 9 and 10), whereas mutants lacking either the upstream or the downstream region competed more efficiently than the central 40-bp but less than the full-length 70-bp AdML promoter (compare lanes 3 and 4 to lanes 5–8). The results indicate that areas both upstream and downstream to the central 40 bp area are important for binding by TAF4b·TAF12. To gain support for this finding, the full-length 70-bp AdML promoter, the mutants lacking either the upstream (60 bp) or the downstream (50 bp) or both (40 bp) and an extended promoter (98 bp) were each labeled and used for binding to the TAF4b·TAF12 complex by EMSA using equimolar amounts. The results show that the level and the stability of the TAF4b·TAF12·DNA complex increase gradually with the addition of the upstream and downstream sequences (Fig. 3B) up to 70 bp. Beyond this length the binding efficiency is similar. To examine further whether DNA length or the sequence surrounding the central AdML promoter contribute to increased DNA binding, the nucleotide sequence of the upstream and downstream regions were changed in the context of the full-length 70-bp AdML promoter and used for competition assay. As shown in Fig. 3C these substitutions did not reduce the binding affinity of TAF4b·TAF12, suggesting that DNA sequence may be less important than its length. To examine further the length requirement for binding we performed similar binding assays with the PEL98 promoter, which is distinct in its sequence from the AdML promoter (supplemental Fig. 2A). This promoter was chosen because of its dependency on TAF4 DNA binding (see below). With this sequence we observed a clear DNA length preference as was found for the AdML promoter as the affinity to 70 bp > 55 bp > 40 bp. In this promoter context we also examined whether the spacing between the TATA-box and the Initiator is important for high affinity binding. The 20 nucleotides between TATA and Initiator were either relocated to the 5′-end or deleted shortening the DNA to 50 bp (supplemental Fig. 2B). The results revealed that changing the spacing but retaining the length does not significantly affect binding affinity, whereas binding is reduced with the shorter 50-bp fragment. To test further the sequence preference we compared the binding between the PEL98 and the non-target promoter PMM2 and found that the complex binds preferentially the PEL98 DNA (supplemental Fig. 2C). These findings together confirm that high affinity DNA binding by TAF4b·TAF12 is achieved through contacts with DNA spanning 70 bp combined with weak sequence preference. A possible explanation that integrates these findings is that TAF4b·TAF12 DNA binding has several points of contact spanning the length of the DNA, some specific and some non-specific, that all contribute to stable binding.

Therefore, it can be hypothesised that sequence variation in the mitochondrial genome is a contributing factor to the etiology of diseases related to these different cellular events, including cancer. The aim of the present study was to assess the frequency of haplogroups and polymorphisms in the control region (CR) of mitochondrial DNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with prostate carcinoma (n = 304) versus patients screened for prostate disease but found to be negative for cancer on biopsy (n = 278) in a Middle European population.The nine major European haplogroups and the CR polymorphisms were identified by means of primer extension analysis and DNA sequencing, respectively. We found that mitochondrial haplogroup frequencies and CR polymorphisms do not differ significantly between patients with or without prostate cancer, implying no impact of inherited mitochondrial DNA variation on predisposition to prostate carcinoma in a Middle European population.Our results contrast with a recent report claiming an association between mtDNA haplogroup U and prostate cancer in a North American population of caucasian descent."
https://openalex.org/W2028349946,"Retinoic acid (RA) causes HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cell myeloid differentiation that is dependent on MAPK signaling. The process is propelled by c-Cbl, which binds the CD38 receptor as part of a signaling complex generating MAPK signaling. Here we report that the capability of c-Cbl to do this is lost in the G306E tyrosine kinase-binding domain mutant. Unlike wild-type (WT) c-Cbl, the G306E mutant c-Cbl fails to propel RA-induced differentiation, and disrupts the normal association with CD38. The G306E mutant does, like WT c-Cbl, co-immunoprecipitate with Vav, Slp-76, and p38. But unlike WT c-Cbl, does not cause MAPK signaling. In contrast, the C381A Ring finger domain mutant functions like WT c-Cbl. It binds CD38 and is part of the same apparent c-Cbl/Slp-76/Vav/p38 signaling complex. The C381A mutant causes MAPK signaling and propels RA-induced differentiation. In addition to HL-60 cells and their WT or mutant c-Cbl stable transfectants, the c-Cbl/Vav/Slp-76 complex is also found in NB4 cells where c-Cbl was previously also found to bind CD38. The data are consistent with a model in which the G306E mutant c-Cbl forms a signaling complex that includes Slp-76, Vav, and p38; but does not drive MAPK signaling because it fails to bind the CD38 receptor. Without the G306E mutation the c-Cbl unites CD38 with the signaling complex and delivers a MAPK signal that drives RA-induced differentiation. The results demonstrate the importance of the Gly306 residue in the ability of c-Cbl to propel RA-induced differentiation."

ODC is a dimeric enzyme, whereas antizyme inhibitor (AZI), a positive regulator of ODC that is homologous to ODC, exists predominantly as a monomer and lacks decarboxylase activity. The goal of this paper was to identify the essential amino acid residues that determine the dimerization of AZI. The nonconserved amino acid residues in the putative dimer interface of AZI (Ser-277, Ser-331, Glu-332, and Asp-389) were substituted with the corresponding residues in the putative dimer interface of ODC (Arg-277, Tyr-331, Asp-332, and Tyr-389, respectively). Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis was used to determine the size distribution of these AZI mutants. The size-distribution analysis data suggest that residue 331 may play a major role in the dimerization of AZI. Mutating Ser-331 to Tyr in AZI (AZI-S331Y) caused a shift from a monomer configuration to a dimer. Furthermore, in comparison with the single mutant AZI-S331Y, the AZI-S331Y/D389Y double mutant displayed a further reduction in the monomer-dimer Kd, suggesting that residue 389 is also crucial for AZI dimerization. Analysis of the triple mutant AZI-S331Y/D389Y/S277R showed that it formed a stable dimer (Kd value = 1.3 μm). Finally, a quadruple mutant, S331Y/D389Y/S277R/E332D, behaved as a dimer with a Kd value of ∼0.1 μm, which is very close to that of the human ODC enzyme. The quadruple mutant, although forming a dimer, could still be disrupted by antizyme (AZ), further forming a heterodimer, and it could rescue the AZ-inhibited ODC activity, suggesting that the AZ-binding ability of the AZI dimer was retained.

When antizymes are overexpressed, they inhibit ODC and promote ubiquitin-independent proteolytic degradation of ODC. Because elevated ODC activity is associated with most forms of human malignancies (1Gerner E.W. Meyskens Jr., F.L. Nat. Rev.

In contrast to the extensive studies on the oncogene ODC, the endogenous antizyme inhibitor (AZI) is less well understood. AZI is homologous to the enzyme ODC. It is a 448-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 50 kDa. However, despite the homology between these proteins, AZI does not possess any decarboxylase activity. It binds to antizyme more tightly than does ODC and releases ODC from the ODC-antizyme complex (53Murakami Y. Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3340-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 54Nilsson J. Grahn B. Heby O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the AZI and AZ proteins display rapid ubiquitin-dependent turnover within a few minutes to 1 h in vivo (5Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14529-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, AZ binding actually stabilizes AZI by inhibiting its ubiquitination (55Bercovich Z. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54097-54102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). AZI, which inactivates all members of the AZ family (53Murakami Y. Ichiba T.

J. 2000; 346: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and prevents the proteolytic degradation of ODC, may play a role in tumor progression. It has been reported that down-regulation of AZI is associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation and reduced ODC activity, presumably through the modulation of AZ function (57Choi K.S. Suh Y.H. Kim W.H. Lee T.H. Jung M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of AZI has been shown to increase cell proliferation and promote cell transformation (58Keren-Paz A. Bercovich Z. Porat Z. Erez O. Brener O. Kahana C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5163-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 59Kim S.W. Mangold U. Waghorne C. Mobascher A. Shantz L. Banyard J. Zetter B.R. J.

Furthermore, AZI is capable of direct interaction with cyclin D1, preventing its degradation, and this effect is at least partially independent of AZ function (60Mangold U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 61Newman R.M. Mobascher A. Mangold U. Koike C. Diah S. Schmidt M. Finley D. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41504-41511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate a role for AZI in the positive regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. It is now known that ODC exists as a dimer and that AZI may exist as a monomer physiologically (62Albeck S. Dym O. Unger T. Snapir Z. Bercovich Z. Kahana C. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the dimeric structures of ODC (Fig. 1A) and AZI (Fig. 1B). Although structural studies indicate that both ODC and AZI crystallize as dimers, the dimeric AZI structure has fewer interactions at the dimer interface, a smaller buried surface area, and a lack of symmetry of the interactions between residues from the two monomers, suggesting that the AZI dimer may be nonphysiological (62Albeck S. Dym O. Unger T. Snapir Z. Bercovich Z. Kahana C. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify the critical amino acid residues governing the difference in dimer formation between ODC and AZI. Our preliminary studies using analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that ODC exists as a dimer, whereas AZI exists in a concentration-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium. Multiple sequence alignments of ODC and AZI from various species have shown that residues 277, 331, 332, and 389 are not conserved between ODC and AZI (Table 1). In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate a series of interface mutants of AZI. Size-distribution analysis of these AZI mutants clearly indicates that a stable AZI dimer similar to the ODC dimer has been successfully obtained.TABLE 1Amino acid residues at the dimer interface of human ODC and AZIHuman ODCResidueHuman AZINonconservedArg277SerTyr331SerAsp332GluTyr389AspConservedAsp134AspLys169LysLys294LysTyr323TyrAsp364AspGly387GlyPhe397Phe Open table in a new tab The human ODC, AZ, and AZI cDNAs were cloned into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), which carries an N-terminal His·Tag sequence that is useful in the purification of these overexpressed proteins. Expression vectors were transformed into the JM109 strain of Escherichia coli. Protein expression was induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside, and the cells were grown at 25 °C overnight. Before purification, the cell pellets were dissolved in 25 ml of binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 500 mm sodium chloride, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (3 ml) was then used to purify the His·Tag proteins. HIS-Select Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma) was first equilibrated with the binding buffer and was then mixed with the cleared lysate at 4 °C for 60 min. The lysate-nickel/gel mixture was loaded into a column and was washed with 100 ml of binding buffer and 100 ml of wash buffer (10 mm imidazole, 500 mm sodium chloride, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). Finally, all proteins were eluted in elution buffer (250 mm imidazole, 500 mm sodium chloride, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After a stepwise wash procedure, the proteins were eluted and concentrated for further experiments. The purity of all recombinant proteins was estimated via SDS-PAGE to be about 95%. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This mutagenesis method uses Pfu DNA polymerase, which replicates both plasmid strands with high fidelity in a 16–20-cycle PCR. Primers with 28–34 bases in length that include the mutations were used for the specific amplification of template DNA. The PCR primers used were as follows: 5′-GATAATTTCAGAACCCGGACGTTACTATGTGTCTTCTGC-3′ for AZI-S277R; 5′-GGTTCTTTTGCAAGTAAACTGTACGAGGACTTAAATACCATTCC-3′ for AZI-S331Y; 5′-GCAAGTAAACTGTCTGACGACTTAAATACCATTCC-3′ for AZI-E332D; and 5′-CTTTGATAACATGGGAGCATACTCTTTCCATGAACCATCTGC-3′ for AZI-D389Y. The mutation positions in the oligonucleotide sequence are underlined and in boldface. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for a period equivalent to 2 min/kb of plasmid length, for a total of 16 cycles. The PCR products were subsequently treated with DpnI to digest the wild-type human AZI templates. Finally, the nicked DNA with the desired mutations was transformed into the XL-1 E. coli strain (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the DNA sequences were checked by autosequencing. The ODC enzyme activity was measured at 37 °C using the CO2-L3K assay kit (DCL, Charlottetown, Canada). The enzyme assay couples the decarboxylation of ornithine to the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to form oxaloacetate, which becomes malate following NADH oxidation. The standard reaction mixture for a spectrophotometric assay of ODC contains 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm ornithine, 0.2 mm PLP, and 0.4 ml of CO2-L3K assay buffer containing 12.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.4 unit/ml microbial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, 4.1 units/ml malate dehydrogenase (mammalian malate dehydrogenase), and 0.6 mm NADH analog in a final volume of 0.5 ml. An appropriate amount of ODC was then added to the assay mixture to initiate the reaction. After the addition of enzyme to the reaction mixture, the decrease of absorbance at 405 nm was continuously traced in a Lambda 25 UV-visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In this coupled assay method, 1 mol of CO2 was produced, and 1 mol of NADH analog was oxidized under the assay conditions. An enzyme unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the production of 1 μmol of NAD per min. An absorption coefficient of 2410 m−1 was used for the NADH analog in the calculations. All of the calculations were performed using the SigmaPlot 10.0 software program (Jandel, San Rafael, CA). Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Sample (380 μl) and buffer solutions (400 μl) were loaded into the double sector centerpiece separately and built up in a Beckman An-50 Ti rotor. Experiments were performed at 20 °C with a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm. Protein samples were monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm in continuous mode with a time interval of 420 s and a step size of 0.002 cm. Multiple scans at different time points were fitted to a continuous size distribution model using the program SEDFIT (63Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar, 64Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P.

All size distributions were solved at a confidence level of p = 0.95, a best fit average anhydrous frictional ratio (f/f0), and a resolution N of 250 sedimentation coefficients between 0.1 and 20.0 S. To determine precisely the dissociation constants of ODC and AZI mutants in monomer-dimer equilibrium, sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at three different protein concentrations for each protein. To calculate dissociation constants (Kd), all sedimentation data were globally fit into the monomer-dimer equilibrium model using the program SEDPHAT (65Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to determine the dissociation constants of the human ODC and AZI proteins toward AZ, sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at five different concentrations of AZ in the presence of a constant concentration of human ODC or AZI. To calculate the Kd value of these heterodimers, all sedimentation data were globally fit into the AB hetero-association model using the program SEDPHAT (65Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The partial specific volumes of the proteins, the solvent densities, and the viscosity were calculated by the software program SEDNTERP (67Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelleter S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science.in: Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). To identify amino acid residues that are required for the dimerization of AZI, a series of dimer interface mutants of AZI was created. Nonconserved amino acid residues in the putative dimer interface of AZI (Ser-277, Ser-331, Glu-332, and Asp-389) were substituted with the corresponding amino acid residues at the respective positions in ODC (Arg-277, Tyr-331, Asp-332, and Tyr-389, respectively). Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis was used to examine the size distribution of the AZI mutants. By global fitting of the sedimentation velocity data, the dissociation constants of the wild-type and interface mutants of human AZI were obtained. Size-distribution analysis of ODC-WT and AZI-WT indicated that ODC is a dimer (Fig. 2A) with a Kd value of 0.18 μm in monomer-dimer equilibrium (Table 2), whereas AZI is in rapid equilibrium between monomer and dimer configurations (Fig. 2B) with a dissociation constant of 84 μm (Table 2). The dissociation constant of AZI, which is larger than that of ODC by 460-fold, indicates a weak interaction at the dimer interface of AZI. Mutation of Ser-331 to Tyr in AZI (AZI-S331Y) resulted in a shift from monomer to dimer (Fig. 2C) with a Kd value of 41 μm (Table 2), a 2-fold decrease compared with AZI-WT protein. The AZI-D389Y protein displayed a small shift in monomer-dimer equilibrium (Fig. 2D), with a Kd value of 72 μm (Table 2). The AZI-S277R and AZI-E332D mutants, however, did not show a shift from monomer to dimer (Fig. 2, E and F, respectively), and it displayed larger Kd values than that of AZI-WT. These data suggest that residue 331 may play a significant role in AZI dimerization.TABLE 2Dissociation constants of the human ODC and AZI mutant proteinsProteinKdaThe Kd value was derived from global data fitting of the sedimentation velocity at three different protein concentrations for each protein.ProteinKdaThe Kd value was derived from global data fitting of the sedimentation velocity at three different protein concentrations for each protein.μmμmODC-wt0.18 ± 0.0009AZI-S331Y/E332D31.0 ± 0.23AZI-wt84.0 ± 0.44AZI-S277R/D389Y43.1 ± 0.38AZI-S331Y40.7 ± 0.20AZI-D389Y/E332D107.2 ± 0.92AZI-D389Y71.9 ± 0.55AZI-S277R/E332D110.9 ± 0.95AZI-S277R105.2 ± 0.77AZI-S331Y/D389Y/S277R1.3 ± 0.01AZI-E332D134.9 ± 1.13AZI-S331Y/D389Y/E332D5.9 ± 0.07AZI-S331Y/D389Y2.7 ± 0.03AZI-S331Y/S277R/E332D20.3 ± 0.22AZI-S331Y/S277R10.8 ± 0.05AZI-S331Y/D389Y/S277R/E332D0.10 ± 0.0006a The Kd value was derived from global data fitting of the sedimentation velocity at three different protein concentrations for each protein. Open table in a new tab The size distribution of the six double mutants of AZI further revealed the importance of residue 331 in the dimerization of AZI. The S331Y-containing AZI double mutants (S331Y/S277R, S331Y/E332D, and S331Y/D389Y) demonstrated significant shifts in equilibrium from monomers to dimers (Fig. 3, A–C, respectively), with significant decreases in Kd values (11, 31, and 2.7 μm, respectively, see Table 2). For AZI-S331Y/D389Y in particular, little monomer existed at equilibrium; most AZI monomers became dimers (Fig. 3C), similar to the size-distribution pattern of ODC-WT (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the Kd value of the S331Y/D389Y double mutant (2.7 μm) displayed a significant reduction in comparison with the single mutant AZI-S331Y (41 μm) and was about 31-fold lower than the AZI-WT (84 μm), suggesting that residue 389 plays a crucial secondary role in the dimerization of AZI. The AZI-D389Y/S277R double mutant, although lacking S331Y, still showed a significant shift in the monomer-dimer equilibrium (Fig. 3D) with a Kd value of 43 μm (Table 2). The fact that the Kd value for this double mutant is similar to that of AZI-S331Y suggests a supplementary role for residues 389 and 277. The double mutants AZI-S277R/E332D and AZI-D389Y/E332D showed no shift in monomer-dimer equilibrium (Fig. 3, E and F, respectively); the Kd values o"

We here report the novel findings that collagen I-induced de novo synthesis of COX-2 in intestinal epithelial cells is inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX) and by an inhibitory peptide selective for the heterotrimeric Gαi3-protein. These findings could be explained by a regulatory involvement of the G-protein-dependent integrin-associated protein CD47. In support of this notion, we observed a collagen I-induced association between CD47 and α2 integrins. This association was reduced by a blocking anti-CD47 antibody but not by PTX or a control anti-β2 antibody. Furthermore, a blocking antibody against CD47, dominant negative CD47 or specific siRNA knock down of CD47, significantly reduced collagen I-induced COX-2 expression. COX-2 has previously been shown to regulate intestinal epithelial cell adhesion and migration. Morphological analysis of intestinal cells adhering to collagen I revealed a co-localisation of CD47 and α2 integrins to non-apoptotic membrane blebs enriched in Rho A and F-actin. The blocking CD47 antibody, PTX and a selective COX-2 inhibitor, dramatically inhibited the formation of these blebs. In accordance, migration of these cells on a collagen I-coated surface or through a collagen I gel were significantly reduced by the CD47 blocking antibody, siRNA knock down of CD47 and the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. In conclusion, we present novel data that identifies the G-protein-dependent CD47 protein as a key regulator of collagen I-induced COX-2 expression and a promoter of intestinal epithelial cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2039808236,"Massively parallel sequencing offers an enormous potential for expression profiling, in particular for interspecific comparisons. Currently, different platforms for massively parallel sequencing are available, which differ in read length and sequencing costs. The 454-technology offers the highest read length. The other sequencing technologies are more cost effective, on the expense of shorter reads. Reliable expression profiling by massively parallel sequencing depends crucially on the accuracy to which the reads could be mapped to the corresponding genes.We performed an in silico analysis to evaluate whether incorrect mapping of the sequence reads results in a biased expression pattern. A comparison of six available mapping software tools indicated a considerable heterogeneity in mapping speed and accuracy. Independently of the software used to map the reads, we found that for compact genomes both short (35 bp, 50 bp) and long sequence reads (100 bp) result in an almost unbiased expression pattern. In contrast, for species with a larger genome containing more gene families and repetitive DNA, shorter reads (35-50 bp) produced a considerable bias in gene expression. In humans, about 10% of the genes had fewer than 50% of the sequence reads correctly mapped. Sequence polymorphism up to 9% had almost no effect on the mapping accuracy of 100 bp reads. For 35 bp reads up to 3% sequence divergence did not affect the mapping accuracy strongly. The effect of indels on the mapping efficiency strongly depends on the mapping software.In complex genomes, expression profiling by massively parallel sequencing could introduce a considerable bias due to incorrectly mapped sequence reads if the read length is short. Nevertheless, this bias could be accounted for if the genomic sequence is known. Furthermore, sequence polymorphisms and indels also affect the mapping accuracy and may cause a biased gene expression measurement. The choice of the mapping software is highly critical and the reliability depends on the presence/absence of indels and the divergence between reads and the reference genome. Overall, we found SSAHA2 and CLC to produce the most reliable mapping results."
https://openalex.org/W2018410656,"ATP synthase uses a unique rotary mechanism to couple ATP synthesis and hydrolysis to transmembrane proton translocation. As part of the synthesis mechanism, the torque of the rotor has to be converted into conformational rearrangements of the catalytic binding sites on the stator to allow synthesis and release of ATP. The gamma subunit of the rotor, which plays a central role in the energy conversion, consists of two long helices inside the central cavity of the stator cylinder plus a globular portion outside the cylinder. Here, we show that the N-terminal helix alone is able to fulfill the function of full-length gamma in ATP synthesis as long as it connects to the rest of the rotor. This connection can occur via the epsilon subunit. No direct contact between gamma and the c ring seems to be required. In addition, the results indicate that the epsilon subunit of the rotor exists in two different conformations during ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2032316603,"Genetic diversity, especially at genes important for immune functioning within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), has been associated with fitness-related traits, including disease resistance, in many species. Recently, genetic diversity has been associated with mate preferences in humans. Here we asked whether these preferences are adaptive in terms of obtaining healthier mates. We investigated whether genetic diversity (heterozygosity and standardized mean d(2)) at MHC and nonMHC microsatellite loci, predicted health in 153 individuals. Individuals with greater allelic diversity (d(2)) at nonMHC loci and at one MHC locus, linked to HLA-DRB1, reported fewer symptoms over a four-month period than individuals with lower d(2). In contrast, there were no associations between MHC or nonMHC heterozygosity and health. NonMHC-d(2) has previously been found to predict male preferences for female faces. Thus, the current findings suggest that nonMHC diversity may play a role in both natural and sexual selection acting on human populations."
https://openalex.org/W2005941455,"Recently features of gene expression profiles have been associated with structural parameters of gene sequences in organisms representing a diverse set of taxa. The emerging picture indicates that natural selection, mediated by gene expression profiles, has a significant role in determining genic structures. However the current situation is less clear in plants as the available data indicates that the effect of natural selection mediated by gene expression is very weak. Moreover, the direction of the patterns in plants appears to contradict those observed in animal genomes. In the present work we analized expression data for >18000 Arabidopsis genes retrieved from public datasets obtained with different technologies (MPSS and high density chip arrays) and compared them with gene parameters. Our results show that the impact of natural selection mediated by expression on genes sequences is significant and distinguishable from the effects of regional mutational biases. In addition, we provide evidence that the level and the breadth of gene expression are related in opposite ways to many structural parameters of gene sequences. Higher levels of expression abundance are associated with smaller transcripts, consistent with the need to reduce costs of both transcription and translation. Expression breadth, however, shows a contrasting pattern, i.e. longer genes have higher breadth of expression, possibly to ensure those structural features associated with gene plasticity. Based on these results, we propose that the specific balance between these two selective forces play a significant role in shaping the structure of Arabidopsis genes."
https://openalex.org/W1996115435,"The octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (AngII) binds to and activates the human angiotensin II type 1 receptor (hAT(1)) of the G protein-coupled receptor class A family. Several activation mechanisms have been proposed for this family, but they have not yet been experimentally validated. We previously used the methionine proximity assay to show that 11 residues in transmembrane domain (TMD) III, VI, and VII of the hAT(1) receptor reside in close proximity to the C-terminal residue of AngII. With the exception of a single change in TMD VI, the same contacts are present on N111G-hAT(1), a constitutively active mutant; this N111G-hAT(1) is a model for the active form of the receptor. In this study, two series of 53 individual methionine mutations were constructed in TMD I, II, IV, and V on both receptor forms. The mutants were photolabeled with a neutral antagonist, (125)I-[Sar(1),p-benzoyl-L-Phe(8)]AngII, and the resulting complexes were digested with cyanogen bromide. Although no new contacts were found for the hAT(1) mutants, two were found in the constitutively active mutants, Phe-77 in TMD II and Asn-200 in TMD V. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a direct ligand contact with TMD II and TMD V has been reported. These contact point differences were used to identify the structural changes between the WT-hAT(1) and N111G-hAT(1) complexes through homology-based modeling and restrained molecular dynamics. The model generated revealed an important structural rearrangement of several TMDs from the basal to the activated form in the WT-hAT(1) receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2064927181,"The New Zealand quail, Coturnix novaezealandiae, was widespread throughout New Zealand until its rapid extinction in the 1870's. To date, confusion continues to exist concerning the identity of C. novaezealandiae and its phylogenetic relationship to Coturnix species in neighbouring Australia, two of which, C. ypsilophora and C. pectoralis, were introduced into New Zealand as game birds. The Australian brown quail, C. ypsilophora, was the only species thought to establish with current populations distributed mainly in the northern part of the North Island of New Zealand. Owing to the similarities between C. ypsilophora, C. pectoralis, and C. novaezealandiae, uncertainty has arisen over whether the New Zealand quail is indeed extinct, with suggestions that remnant populations of C. novaezealandiae may have survived on offshore islands.Using fresh and historical samples of Coturnix sp. from New Zealand and Australia, DNA analysis of selected mitochondrial regions was carried out to determine phylogenetic relationships and species status. Results show that Coturnix sp. specimens from the New Zealand mainland and offshore island Tiritiri Matangi are not the New Zealand quail but are genetically identical to C. ypsilophora from Australia and can be classified as the same species. Furthermore, cytochrome b and COI barcoding analysis of the New Zealand quail and Australia's C. pectoralis, often confused in museum collections, show that they are indeed separate species that diverged approximately 5 million years ago (mya). Gross morphological analysis of these birds suggests a parallel loss of sustained flight with very little change in other phenotypic characters such as plumage or skeletal structure.Ancient DNA has proved invaluable for the detailed analysis and identification of extinct and morphologically cryptic taxa such as that of quail and can provide insights into the timing of evolutionary changes that influence morphology."

An association between recombinant proteins; ERα and MS-KIF18A was demonstrated in vitro in a pull down assay. Such interactions were proven also for endogenous proteins in MBA-15 cells were detected prominently in the cytoplasm and are up-regulated by estrogen. Additionally, an association between these proteins and the transcription factor NF-κB was identified. MS-KIF18A mRNA expression was measured in vivo in relation to age and estrogen level in mice and rats models. A decrease in MS-KIF18A mRNA level was measured in old and in OVX-estrogen depleted rats as compared to young animals. The low MS-KIF18A mRNA expression in OVX rats was restored by estrogen treatment. We studied the regulation of MS-KIF18A transcription by estrogen using the luciferase reporter gene and chromatin immuno-percipitation (ChIP) assays. The luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated an increase in MS-KIF18A promoter activity in response to 10−8 M estrogen and 10−7M ICI-182,780. Complimentary, the ChIP assay quantified the binding of ERα and pcJun to the MS-KIF18A promoter that was enhanced in cells treated by estrogen and ICI-182,780. In addition, cells treated by estrogen expressed higher levels of MS-KIF18A mRNA and protein and the protein turnover in MBA-15 cells was accelerated. Presented data demonstrated that ERα is a defined cargo of MS-KIF18A and added novel insight on the role of estrogen in regulation of MS-KIF18A expression both in vivo and in vitro."

Participants were presented with Kanizsa and control figures and had to decide whether the horizontal or vertical length of stimulus was longer using the two-alternative force choice method. Our findings show that large but not small Kanizsa figures are perceived as compressed, that such compression is large in the horizontal dimension and small or nil in the vertical dimension. In contrast to recent findings, we found no saccadic compression for control rectangles.Our data suggest that compression of Kanizsa figure has been overestimated in previous research due to methodological artifacts, and highlight the importance of studying perceptual phenomena by multiple methods."
