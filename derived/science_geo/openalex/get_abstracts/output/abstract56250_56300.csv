https://openalex.org/W1545591640,"The identity of the nonpolar transformation products of testosterone-1,2-3H, the time course of the appearance of these metabolites in various tissue compartments, and the subcellular distribution of testosterone and its metabolites in prostate have been investigated following the intravenous administration of the hormone to normal and to functionally hepatectomized rats. Evidence has been obtained in both types of animals that within 1 min following its administration testosterone is taken up by the prostate, and at least 90% is converted to three products, androstandiol, dihydrotestosterone, and androsterone. From prostatic nuclei, however, only testosterone-3H and dihydrotestosterone-3H were recovered for as long as 2 hours following testosterone injection. Furthermore, it has been shown that in the presence of a NADPH2-generating system prostatic nuclei convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, whereas prostatic cytoplasm, in addition, reduces dihydrotestosterone to androstandiol. The nuclear enzyme which performs this reaction has been partially characterized and appears to be located within the chromatin. Finally, the tissue distribution of dihydrotestosterone-3H has been investigated at a short time interval following testosterone-1,2-3H injection; this metabolite was detected only in prostate, seminal vesicle, preputial gland, kidney, and plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1483105549,"Abstract The actions of certain lipolytic and antilipolytic agents were studied in isolated fat cells at the level of cyclic AMP. The following observations were made. Epinephrine (5.5 µm) produced small but significant changes in cyclic AMP levels in 10-min incubations while caffeine (1 mm) was without significant effect. In combination, epinephrine and caffeine acted synergistically, producing large increases in cyclic AMP, indicating that, as in other systems, the catecholamines act to stimulate adenyl cyclase and the methyl xanthines act to inhibit the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Other hormones which acted to increase cyclic AMP levels in the presence of 1 mm caffeine included adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), glucagon, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, norepinephrine, and the synthetic catecholamine isoproterenol. Increased levels of cyclic AMP were detectable within 30 sec after the addition of epinephrine to fat cells incubated with 1 mm caffeine and were maximal at about 6 min, after which they declined. Supramaximal epinephrine and supramaximal ACTH together did not produce greater stimulation than either agent alone, which suggested that they might act at the same location. Three compounds with antilipolytic activity were tested. Insulin decreased cyclic AMP levels in fat cells exposed to epinephrine, ACTH, or glucagon in the presence of caffeine, while the β-adrenergic blocking agent pronethalol was effective against epinephrine but not ACTH or glucagon under the experimental conditions used. Nicotinic acid decreased cyclic AMP levels in the presence of epinephrine."

These effects suggest but do not prove that PGF2a contracts bronchial muscle. They might be caused by changes in fluid distribution in the lungs. Main3 and Horton and Main4 showed that prostaglandins E1, E2, E3, F1a and F2a relax cat isolated trachea. Because of the uncertainty about the action of PGF2a on tracheo-bronchial muscle and because this prostaglandin and PGE2 have been found in human lungs5,6, where they may affect the smooth muscle of the bronchial tree, we studied their effects on human isolated bronchial muscle. We also studied the effects of PGE1 and of mixtures of PGE1 or PGE2 with PGF2a on this smooth muscle preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1572054656,"Abstract Oxidation of TPNH by liver microsomes from normal rats resulted in a concomitant disappearance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (primarily arachidonic acid) from the membrane phospholipids. The utilization of the polyunsaturated fatty acids was completely dependent on the presence of TPNH in the system. As much as 15% of the total microsomal fatty acids was consumed by the reaction within 30 to 45 min. Since the ester value of the phospholipids remained constant, it was evident that polyunsaturated fatty acids were being converted to some as yet unidentified moiety in situ on the phospholipid. The reaction showed greatest specificity for arachidonic acid at the β-acyl position. The polyunsaturated fatty acids in both phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine were consumed. The altered phospholipids were shown to be considerably more polar than normal microsomal phospholipids. They were still subject to the action of phospholipase A, however."

https://openalex.org/W1537448859,"Abstract The data reported indicate that rat uterus nuclei possess the capacity to synthesize RNA in vivo and in vitro by mechanisms similar to those previously reported for rat liver nuclei. Tritiated uridine administered to the intact adult rat is rapidly taken up by the uterus and incorporated into nuclear RNA. Maximum specific activity of the nuclear RNA is reached at 20 min following administration of the radioisotope and decreases thereafter, while that of cytoplasmic RNA increases to a maximum at 6 to 12 hours, which indicates a turnover of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) in intact nuclei isolated from the uterus was studied in the presence of Mg2+ ions at low ionic strength or in the presence of Mn2+ ions and 0.4 m ammonium sulfate. Both RNA polymerase reactions are inhibited by actinomycin D, DNase, or RNase. Analyses of base composition and nearest neighbor base frequencies indicate that the product of the Mg2+-activated RNA polymerase reaction is similar to ribosomal RNA, whereas that of the Mn2+-(NH4)2SO4-activated reaction is more DNA-like. Sucrose density gradient sedimentation indicates extensive degradation of the RNA synthesized during incubation in both conditions. During the 3-week period following ovariectomy of the adult rat, there is a progressive decline in the rate of uterine RNA synthesis. An initial decrease in the rate of synthesis of nuclear RNA rapidly labeled in vivo is followed sequentially by decreases in the activities of Mg2+-activated and Mn2+-(NH4)2SO4-activated RNA polymerase measured in isolated nuclei. The concentration of whole tissue RNA or protein per mg of DNA in the organ decreases following ovariectomy, but the ratio of nuclear RNA or protein per mg of DNA appears to be unaltered. A single injection of 10 µg of estradiol-17β to the adult rat ovariectomized 3 weeks previously stimulates uterine RNA synthesis. Nuclear RNA synthesis in vivo is accelerated prior to sequential stimulations of the two RNA polymerase activities. Concentrations of total RNA and protein are restored to normal levels as a result of hormone treatment. At 20 min following hormone treatment, the rate of synthesis of nuclear RNA rapidly labeled in vivo is accelerated 500 to 600%. This acceleration is accompanied by an increased uptake of 3H-uridine by the organ. Whether the increase in specific activity is a cause or a consequence of the increased uptake is unknown. Ovariectomy or administration of estradiol-17β influences neither the principal characteristics and kinetics of the RNA polymerase reactions nor the base composition and nearest neighbor base frequencies of their products. The stimulatory effect of estrogen in vivo on RNA synthesis in uterine nuclei is inhibited 80 to 100% by prior treatment of the ovariectomized rat with actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Treatment or prior treatment of the immature rat with histamine, the antihistamine mepyramine, or the histamine releaser p-methoxy-n-methylphenethylamine (48-80) has no effect on estrogen-stimulated RNA synthesis in uterine nuclei. No stimulation of RNA polymerase activity has yet been obtained by the incubation in vitro of uterine nuclei with estradiol-17β. It is concluded that an acceleration of the synthesis of all types of RNA, but particularly of that of ribosomal RNA and of ribosomes, is an essential feature of the early action of estrogen in the uterus."
https://openalex.org/W1589477045,"Abstract Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase was purified from extracts of Escherichia coli by conventional methods and the enzyme was crystallized from ammonium sulfate solution. The crystalline preparation appeared homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and upon zone electrophoresis. The reduction of hydroxypyruvate-P proceeded faster than the oxidation of phosphoglycerate (PGA) and the latter reaction was inhibited by DPNH. The equilibrium value measured in the direction of PGA oxidation was 7 x 10-11 m at pH 7.5 and 25°. l Serine in the range of 1 to 10 µm inhibited the PGA dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of PGA and reduction of hydroxypyruvate-P. Maximum inhibition was about 95%. To get inhibition with other amino acids concentrations of 1 mm and higher were required. The dose-response curves for serine were sigmoid-shaped and when converted to Hill plots gave slopes that approached 2. l-Serine was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to hydroxypyruvate-P, an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to PGA and DPNH, and gave mixed type inhibition with respect to DPN. The substrates gave regular Michaelis-Menton kinetics. Analogues of DPNH functioned as coenzymes but TPNH had only 7.5% the activity of DPNH."
https://openalex.org/W1659584651,"Abstract Preparations of enoyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase have been purified 250-fold over crude extracts of Escherichia coli. Such preparations catalyze the reduction of α,β-unsaturated acyl-ACP to saturated derivatives. They utilize both TPNH and DPNH as electron donors for the reduction of the substrate. Available evidence indicates that the TPNH-dependent and the DPNH-dependent reductase activities are due to two distinct enzymes, a TPNH enoyl-ACP reductase and a DPNH enoyl-ACP reductase. The TPNH enoyl reductase is unstable at higher pH values (g7.50) and is enzymatically inactive above pH 8.0. It exhibits an absolute specificity for the acyl-ACP substrates and is more active on crotonyl-ACP than on longer chain α,β-unsaturated acyl-ACP. It has a functional thiol group and can be readily inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, iodoacetate, and N-ethylmaleimide. In contrast, the DPNH enoyl-ACP reductase is relatively stable at higher pH values and is enzymatically active over a wide range of pH values. It utilizes both acyl-ACP and acyl coenzyme A substrates and exhibits higher activity with decenoyl-ACP than with crotonyl-ACP. It has a functional thiol group and can be readily inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and iodoacetate, but not by N-ethylmaleimide which causes 2- to 3-fold stimulation of enzymatic activity. The reductase reaction is essentially irreversible, and the stoichiometry of the reaction is consistent with the formulation that 1 mole of reduced pyridine nucleotide is consumed for every mole of α,β-unsaturated acyl-ACP reduced. Evidence is presented that the fatty acid-synthesizing system of E. coli requires both TPNH and DPNH for maximum activity. The requirement for DPNH is at the reductase step, and both nucleotides have a synergistic effect in total fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1581324561,"Abstract Linoleic acid-1-14C was incubated with subcellular fractions of rat liver to study the mechanism of polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis. The most effective system for the chain elongation of linoleic acid to eicosadienoic acid was liver microsomes plus malonyl coenzyme A with cofactors, NADPH, and ATP. Under anaerobic conditions, the chain elongation reaction could be separated quantitatively from the dehydrogenation reaction which otherwise required the same system. The chain elongation of linoleic acid was inhibited by saturated fatty acids of which myristic and pentadecanoic acids were most effective. Mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids also act as inhibitors. From consideration of reaction kinetics and inhibition by other fatty acids, the conversion of linoleic acid to γ-linolenic acid seems preferred over the conversion of linoleic acid to homolinoleic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1599096812,"Abstract A method is described for determining TPN+ and TPNH in a single tissue homogenate made in dilute NaOH at 0°. One portion, for TPN+, is acidified after adding ascorbic acid to prevent TPNH oxidation. A second portion, for TPNH, is heated (still alkaline) after adding cysteine to prevent oxidation. If desired, a third portion can be analyzed directly without heating for total TPN (TPN+ plus TPNH). The same homogenate can also be used for measuring DPN+ and DPNH. In all cases the actual analyses are made with enzymatic cycling. Consequently, by reason of the high sensitivity, it is unnecessary to deproteinize. The procedure presented avoids the danger of TPNH oxidation to TPN+ by tissue hemoglobin which was responsible for our earlier erroneous conclusion that there exists an acid-labile tissue form of TPN+. The oxidation of TPNH by hemoglobin has been studied intensively. The oxidation by free hemoglobin occurs to the same degree in strong acids as in dilute. Therefore, the possibility of obtaining erroneously high TPN+ values is not eliminated by the preparation of homogenates in strong acid, although TPN+ formation is greatly decreased if red blood cells in the tissue are intact at the time of strong acid addition. Neither is the danger eliminated by preparation of extracts with heat at neutral pH. With the use of the revised procedure the levels of TPN+ and TPNH were measured in liver, kidney, heart, brain, and blood. The ratio of TPNH to TPN+ was found to vary from 20 to 1 in heart to 3 to 1 in blood."

https://openalex.org/W1571975921,"Abstract Kinetic studies with crystallized pigeon liver malic enzyme (malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), EC 1.1.1.40) gave intersecting initial velocity plots that conform to a sequential mechanism. The following product inhibition patterns were observed with TPN and malate, respectively, as variable substrates: bicarbonate, noncompetitive and noncompetitive; pyruvate, uncompetitive and uncompetitive; and TPNH, competitive and noncompetitive. These results are consistent with an ordered kinetic mechanism where TPN is added first, followed by malate, and the products are released in the order bicarbonate, pyruvate, and TPNH. Detailed analysis of the kinetic data suggest the existence of an abortive enzyme-bicarbonate complex. A reaction mechanism involving two conformational states of the enzyme is postulated. The Michaelis constants for TPN and malate, at pH 7, were found to be 1.4 µm and 86 µm, respectively. Apparent Michaelis constants for the back reaction were 13 mm, 6.4 mm, and 2.1 µm for bicarbonate, pyruvate, and TPNH. Dissociation constants of TPN and TPNH were determined from kinetic studies to be 0.96 µm and approximately 3 µm."

The Michaelis constants for TPN and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate are 3.4 x 10-5 m and 2.6 x 10-5 m, respectively. Optimum enzyme activity is obtained at pH 6.8 to 8. The immediate product of the reaction is 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, rather than 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. The equilibrium constant of the reaction is approximately 0.14. ATP at 2 mm inhibits the activity in crude extracts of Clostridium acidi-urici about 45%. The purified enzyme and the enzyme in crude extracts of C. cylindrosporum are less sensitive to inhibition by ATP."

Both fractions are required for the over-all reaction. Enzyme II will catalyze the exchange of the hydrogens at C-3 and C-5 of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose with the medium. dTDP-l-rhamnose synthesized with the purified enzymes in D2O contains 1 atom of deuterium at C-3 and 1 atom of deuterium at C-5 of l-rhamnose. Possible mechanisms to account for these observations are discussed. These mechanisms postulate that dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-l-mannose bound to Enzyme II is reduced by Enzyme I and TPNH. Heat denaturation studies indicate that Enzyme I can bind TPNH."

Type I enzyme is split into type I(A) and type I(F); the latter is more intense in cord blood; in hemolyzates of adult blood, the activity of the two bands is usually about equal.

https://openalex.org/W1551002451,"Abstract Rat liver NAD kinase (ATP:NAD 2'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.23) was purified about 70-fold. The Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) for NAD and ATP were 8 x 10-4 m and 2 x 10-3 m, respectively. NAD kinase activity was markedly inhibited by NADH and also NADPH. The Ki of NADH was approximately 1 x 10-4 m, and that of NADPH was approximately 5 x 10-5 m. Both inhibitions were competitive with NAD, and the inhibition of NADH and NADPH was partially additive. NADP had little or no inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity. p-Hydroxymercuribenzoate (2 x 10-5 m) inhibited NAD kinase activity. This inhibition was reversed by 1-cysteine or 2-mercaptoethanol. The possible role of the reduced pyridine nucleotides in the control of NADP synthesis has been considered."

https://openalex.org/W1595046057,"Abstract Oral administration of a mixture of amino acids to adrenalectomized rats resulted in a 4-fold rise in tyrosine transaminase activity of liver and a doubling of the tryptophan pyrrolase activity. This stimulation was completely inhibited by administration of actinomycin at the same time as the amino acid mixture. The basal level of either enzyme activity was not greatly affected by actinomycin. Tryptophan alone, administered at the dose present in the complete mixture, stimulated the activity of both enzymes by a process completely sensitive to actinomycin. Administration of larger doses of tryptophan caused greater increases in the activity of both enzymes. All of the stimulation of tyrosine transaminase activity, brought about by all doses of tryptophan, was abolished by actinomycin, but a proportion of the stimulated tryptophan pyrrolase activity brought about by the higher doses of tryptophan was insensitive to actinomycin. This portion increased with increased amounts of tryptophan. Similar results were obtained when tryptophan was administered intraperitoneally. When an amino acid mixture not containing tryptophan was administered, significant changes in tyrosine transaminase activity were elicited, but the increase in tryptophan pyrrolase activity was not statistically significant. These results show that administration of amino acids stimulates the activity of tyrosine transaminase and tryptophan pyrrolase by a process which requires RNA synthesis, and that the stimulation by tryptophan of tyrosine transaminase activity is entirely, and that of tryptophan pyrrolase partially, dependent on the synthesis of RNA. This conclusion is contrary to the generally accepted view that the stimulation of the activity of tryptophan pyrrolase by tryptophan does not require RNA synthesis and thereby differs from the hydrocortisone stimulation of the activity of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2111603617,"Abstract Epinephrine increases the permeability of isolated frog sartorius muscles to 3-O-methyl-d-glucose. This effect resembles the action of insulin in that, at 19°, there is an absolute lag of 30 min preceding a rise in permeability, while at 0° no alteration of permeability is seen during several hours of incubation. The delayed effect of epinephrine on permeability contrasts with its prompt glycogenolytic effect at 19°; the hormone also causes a distinct rise in the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate at 0°. The effect of epinephrine on permeability can be prevented completely by the addition of pronethalol, an adrenergic β-receptor blocking agent, to the medium. Moreover, when muscles that have been incubated with epinephrine are subsequently incubated with pronethalol, the hormonal effect on permeability is readily reversed. Adrenochrome does not affect permeability of sartorius muscles to sugar. Of the concentrations of epinephrine tested, the lowest one that causes a change in permeability is 10-7 m. A supramaximal concentration, 10-5 m, produces an increase in permeability that is equivalent to that of a submaximal concentration of insulin, 50 µunits per ml. The effects of supramaximal concentrations of epinephrine and insulin on permeability are not additive; thus, the two hormones appear to act on the same transport system for sugar. However, epinephrine causes the formation of free glucose within the cells, and this glucose in turn induces counterflow transport when the movement of 3-O-methyl-d-glucose across the cell membrane is studied. The fact that epinephrine accelerates the formation of free glucose in muscle cells should be taken into consideration when the effects of epinephrine on utilization of sugars in muscle are evaluated."

https://openalex.org/W2132771607,"A several fold increase in the activity of tyrosine-α-ketoglutarate transaminase occurs in intact or adrenalectomized rats following treatment with an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein, whereas tryptophan pyrrolase is unresponsive to this treatment. Doses of tyrosine, tryptophan, or the combination of these amino acids equivalent in amount to those contained in an effective dose of casein hydrolysate did not produce a rise in tyrosine transaminase activity. The effect of casein hydrolysate is inhibited by actinomycin D or cycloheximide, indicating that the synthesis of new RNA and protein is associated with the response of tyrosine transaminase to casein hydrolysate. Additive and, in some cases, synergistic effects on tyrosine transaminase are observed when casein hydrolysate and hydrocortisone are given together or sequentially. In contrast to the response of this enzyme, no additive effect on tryptophan pyrrolase or serine dehydrase occurs when 1 g of casein hydrolysate is given at the same time as a large dose of hydrocortisone. Treatment of adrenalectomized rats with casein hydrolysate, 4 or 8 hours after they were treated with hydrocortisone, stimulates a marked further increase in the activity of tyrosine transaminase. In intact rats, tyrosine transaminase shows a synergistic response to casein hydrolysate when it is given concomitantly with a small dose of hydrocortisone; under these conditions tryptophan pyrrolase is also responsive, but this effect appears to be due to tryptophan stabilization of the enzyme against degradation. When a low dosage of hydrocortisone is administered to intact rats, tryptophan pyrrolase, but not tyrosine transaminase, shows an increase in activity. On the other hand, of these two enzymes, only the transaminase responds to casein hydrolysate. Each of these treatments stimulates the incorporation of orotic acid-6-14C into liver RNA to about the same extent, indicating either that this is a selective effect or that factors in addition to new RNA synthesis are involved in the induction of these enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2086453281,Among the factors that can govern the relative rates of mitochondrial oxidation of isocitrate by means of the isocitrate dehydrogenases linked to diphospho- and triphosphopyridine nucleotides are the intramitochondrial concentrations of these nucleotides. Yeast mitochondria contain enzymes that can alter the ratio of these pyridine nucleotides by interconverting them. A diphosphopyridine nucleotide kinase catalyzes the formation of triphosphopyridine nucleotide from diphosphopyridine nucleotide and adenosine triphosphate; a phosphatase converts triphosphopyridine nucleotide to diphosphopyridine nucleotide. Both reactions are more active with the reduced forms of the pyridine nucleotide coenzymes. These studies suggest that the activity of the mitochondrial triphosphopyridine-nucleotide-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase may be regulated by a cyclic system of pyridine-nucleotide interconversions involving triphosphopyridine nucleotide synthesis and breakdown.

https://openalex.org/W1576733797,"Abstract Cell-free extracts of Astasia longa possess the following enzymes at the indicated relative activities: (a) quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase, 0.5; (b) nicotinic acid mononucleotide pyrophosphorylase, 1; (c) nicotinic acid dinucleotide pyrophosphorylase, 1; (d) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase, 0.003; (e) nicotinamide dinucleotide kinase, 1; (f) nicotinamide deamidase, 1; (g) nicotinic acid methyltransferase, 0.0001. The presence of Enzymes a, c, d, and e, in conjunction with data on the intracellular levels of deamido-NMN, deamido-NAD, NAD, and NADP, establishes this sequence of compounds as the pathway of biosynthesis of pyridine nucleotides in Astasia and indicates that the conversion of deamido-NAD to NAD is a rate-limiting step. Cell-free extracts also catalyzed the degradation and pyrophosphorolysis of deamido-NAD and of NAD, and catalyzed an exchange reaction between nicotinic acid and the nicotinamide moiety of NAD. These reactions, in conjunction with the presence of Enzymes b and f, and with data showing a high rate of turnover of NAD in exponentially growing cultures, indicate the operation of a nicotinic acid salvage pathway in Astasia. The finding that nicotinic acid is an inhibitor of Enzyme a and that quinolinic acid is an inhibitor of Enzyme b suggests a possible means of control of the relative rates of the biosynthetic and the salvage pathways. The finding that deamido-NAD, present in relatively high concentrations in Astasia, is an inhibitor of Enzyme b suggests another possible control mechanism. Growth in the presence of nicotinic acid or quinolinic acid did not lead to repression of either Enzyme a or b. Nicotinamide and high concentrations of nicotinic acid inhibited the growth of Astasia and nicotinamide repressed the level of Enzymes a and b."
https://openalex.org/W1485032540,"Abstract Astasia longa grown in synthetic media incorporate labeled nicotinic acid into deamido-NMN, deamido-NAD, NAD, and NADP. The specific activities of these pyridine nucleotides after a 2-min pulse are compatible with the operation of the Preiss-Handler pathway of NAD biosynthesis. Label also appeared in nicotinamide, NMN, and the N-methyl derivatives of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, indicating a high turnover of NAD in this protozoan cell. The relative amounts of deamido-NMN, deamido-NAD, NAD, and NADP were about 1:5:20:2 in both exponentially growing cultures and in cultures synchronized by means of a repetitive temperature cycle. Appreciable synthesis of pyridine nucleotides did not begin until the middle of the warm period, when almost half of the population had divided, and synthesis continued throughout the cold period. The NAD and NADP contents of the cell were relatively constant throughout the synchrony cycle, but the ratio of deamido-NMN to deamido-NAD changed. Growth in the presence of nicotinic acid leads to an increased intracellular concentration of pyridine derivatives, suggesting that the rate of endogenous supply of deamido-NMN precursors is one rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of NAD in Astasia. The maintenance of a high and relatively constant level of deamido-NAD indicates that the supply of endogenous deamido-NMN precursors is not the only regulatory process controlling the level of pyridine nucleotides. Growth of Astasia in the presence of high nicotinic acid concentrations leads to the synthesis of a pink pigment which does not appear to be present under normal conditions of growth, i.e. in the absence of nicotinic acid. High nicotinic acid during growth also leads to a large increase in the level of an unidentified guanine-containing nucleotide."
