https://openalex.org/W2017347785,"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is a maternally inherited disease resulting in optic nerve degeneration and cardiac dysrhythmia. A mitochondrial DNA replacement mutation was identified that correlated with this disease in multiple families. This mutation converted a highly conserved arginine to a histidine at codon 340 in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene and eliminated an Sfa NI site, thus providing a simple diagnostic test. This finding demonstrated that a nucleotide change in a mitochondrial DNA energy production gene can result in a neurological disease."
https://openalex.org/W2020672093,"The serum response element (SRE) is a sequence required for transient transcriptional activation of genes in response to growth factors. We have isolated cDNA clones encoding serum response factor (SRF), a ubiquitous nuclear protein that binds to the SRE. The SRF gene is highly conserved through evolution, and in cultured cells its transcription is itself transiently increased following serum stimulation. A cDNA clone of SRF expressed in vitro generates protein that forms complexes indistinguishable from those formed with HeLa cell SRF, as judged by DNA binding specificity and the ability to promote SRE-dependent in vitro transcription. SRF binds DNA as a dimer, and the DNA binding/dimerization domain of the protein exhibits striking homology to two yeast regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2012034467,"Mutational inactivation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility (RB) gene has been proposed as a crucial step in the formation of retinoblastoma and other types of human cancer. This hypothesis was tested by introducing, via retroviral-mediated gene transfer, a cloned RB gene into retinoblastoma or osteosarcoma cells that had inactivated endogenous RB genes. Expression of the exogenous RB gene affected cell morphology, growth rate, soft agar colony formation, and tumorigenicity in nude mice. This demonstration of suppression of the neoplastic phenotype by a single gene provides direct evidence for an essential role of the RB gene in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1996063915,"An activity that unwinds double-stranded RNA has been reported to exist in several organisms. We have analyzed the RNA intermediates and final products of the unwinding reaction. Although the RNA becomes sensitive to single strand-specific ribonucleases during the reaction, the duplex is never completely unwound. Furthermore, the base pairing properties of the RNA are permanently altered; the reacted RNA cannot rehybridize to form the original duplex. We demonstrate that during the reaction many, but not all, of the adenosine residues are converted to inosine residues, and we propose that the covalent modification is responsible for the irreversible change in base pairing properties. Possible biological roles for the unwinding/modifying activity, as well as its relevance to antisense RNA experiments, are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2043873747,"Calicheamicin gamma 1I is a recently discovered diyne-ene--containing antitumor antibiotic with considerable potency against murine tumors. In vitro, this drug interacts with double-helical DNA in the minor groove and causes site-specific double-stranded cleavage. It is proposed that the observed cleavage specificity is a result of a unique fit of the drug and DNA followed by the generation of a nondiffusible 1,4-dehydrobenzene--diradical species that initiates oxidative strand scission by hydrogen abstraction on the deoxyribose ring. The ability of calicheamicin gamma 1I to cause double-strand cuts at very low concentrations may account for its potent antitumor activity."

https://openalex.org/W1998108444,"Progesterone (PRE) or glucocorticoid receptor (GRE) DNA binding sites are often found clustered with binding sites for other transcription factors. Individual protein binding sites were tested without the influence of adjacent factors by analyzing isolated combinations of several transcription factor binding sites with PREs or GREs. All show strong synergistic effects on steroid induction. The degree of synergism is inversely related to the strength of the GRE. Thus, a steroid responsive unit can be composed of several modules that, if positioned correctly, act synergistically."

The grafted cells survived and produced sufficient NGF to prevent the degeneration of cholinergic neurons that would die without treatment. In addition, the protected cholinergic cells sprouted axons that projected in the direction of the cellular source of NGF. These results indicate that a combination of gene transfer and intracerebral grafting may provide an effective treatment for some disorders of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1979646488,"The ras p21 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) was purified from human placental tissue. Internal amino acid sequence was obtained from this 120,000-dalton protein and, by means of this sequence, two types of complementary DNA clones were isolated and characterized. One type encoded GAP with a predicted molecular mass of 116,000 daltons and 96% identity with bovine GAP. The messenger RNA of this GAP was detected in human lung, brain, liver, leukocytes, and placenta. The second type appeared to be generated by a differential splicing mechanism and encoded a novel form of GAP with a predicted molecular mass of 100,400 daltons. This protein lacks the hydrophobic amino terminus characteristic of the larger species, but retains GAP activity. The messenger RNA of this type was abundantly expressed in placenta and in several human cell lines, but not in adult tissues."

We have cloned the region containing da and have found that five recessive lethal da mutations map to a single transcription unit. A predicted protein product of this transcription unit has sequence similarities with the oncogene myc, with the gene MyoD1, which is involved in myoblast determination, and with the Drosophila achaete-scute complex, which is involved in neuronal precursor determination. The role of da as a gene controlling cell determination in multiple developmental pathways is discussed."

In a time- and dose-dependent fashion, viral replication spread within the human lymphoid organs. Combination immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed only viral RNA transcripts in most infected cells, but some cells had both detectable viral transcripts and viral protein. Infected cells were always more apparent in the medulla than in the cortex of the thymus. These studies demonstrate that an acute infection of human lymphoid organs with HIV-1 can be followed in the SCID-hu mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1972458635,"A novel method has been developed for modulating the expression of an endogenous chromosomal gene in a higher eukaryote, by competitive inhibition at the level of gene transcription. The gene studied was the hsp70 gene, which encodes a 72-kilodalton (kD) heat shock protein that is synthesized after thermal stress. The 5' control region of the hsp70 gene was inserted on a plasmid containing the eukaryotic gene for dihydrofolate reductase. The hybrid plasmid was then introduced into a Chinese hamster ovary cell line and elevated in copy number approximately 20,000-fold by selection of cells with methotrexate. Heat-inducible expression from the intact hsp70 gene was reduced by at least 90% in the modified cells when compared with the induction in control cells, and the modified cells also displayed elevated thermosensitivity. The change in heat shock protein synthesis is presumably caused by competition among the increased number of binding sites for the heat-shock transcription factor, leading to altered expression from the native heat shock gene. These results support a role for heat shock protein in the recovery of mammalian cells from acute thermal stress."
https://openalex.org/W2037773920,"Cell types associated with angiotensinogen mRNA in rat brain were identified in individual brain sections by in situ hybridization with tritiated RNA probes or with a sulfur-35--labeled oligonucleotide combined with immunocytochemical detection of either glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes or microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2) for neurons. Autoradiography revealed silver grains clustered primarily over GFAP-reactive soma and processes; most grain clusters were not associated with MAP-2--reactive cells. These results demonstrate that, in contrast to other known neuropeptide precursors, angiotensinogen is synthesized by glia."

https://openalex.org/W2062880866,"Three variations to the structure of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus were made to try to change the substrate specificity from lactate to malate: Asp197----Asn, Thr246----Gly, and Gln102----Arg). Each modification shifts the specificity from lactate to malate, although only the last (Gln102----Arg) provides an effective and highly specific catalyst for the new substrate. This synthetic enzyme has a ratio of catalytic rate (kcat) to Michaelis constant (Km) for oxaloacetate of 4.2 x 10(6)M-1 s-1, equal to that of native lactate dehydrogenase for its natural substrate, pyruvate, and a maximum velocity (250 s-1), which is double that reported for a natural malate dehydrogenase from B. stearothermophilus."

https://openalex.org/W2033635529,"A number of different membrane associated isoforms of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) have previously been identified. Here the structure of a novel secreted isoform of N-CAM is established by analysis of a cDNA corresponding to an N-CAM mRNA from human skeletal muscle. The mRNA incorporates a novel sequence block into the extracellular domain, which introduces an in-frame stop codon and thus prematurely terminates the coding sequence, generating a truncated N-CAM polypeptide. Analysis of genomic clones indicates that the inserted sequence is present as a discrete exon within the human N-CAM gene, and Northern analysis shows it to be associated specifically with a 5.2 kb mRNA species from skeletal muscle and brain. Stable transfectants expressing the secreted isoform accumulate it in the cytoplasm and release it to the culture medium. In contrast, cells transfected with cDNA encoding lipid-tailed N-CAM express it predominantly at the cell surface. The existence of a secreted isoform may further expand the spectrum of N-CAM function beyond its known involvement in intercellular adhesion to extracellular matrix interactions."

On the basis of a large amount of environmental data and new integrated dose assessment and risk models, the collective dose commitment to the approximately 3 billion inhabitants is calculated to be 930,000 person-gray, with 97% in the western Soviet Union and Europe. The best estimates for the lifetime expectation of fatal radiogenic cancer would increase the risk from 0 to 0.02% in Europe and 0 to 0.003% in the Northern Hemisphere.

Infectious HIV, indistinguishable from parental virus by immunoblot analysis, was recovered from the spleen, lymph nodes, and skin of five of five affected animals."
https://openalex.org/W2083293254,"The mammalian X and Y chromosomes are thought to have evolved from a common, nearly homologous chromosome pair. Although there is little sequence similarity between the mouse or the human X and Y, there are several regions in which moderate to extensive sequence homologies have been found, including, but not limited to, the so-called pseudoautosomal segment, in which X-Y pairing and recombination take place. The steroid sulfatase gene is in the psuedoautosomal region of the mouse, but not in man. We have cloned and characterized the human STS X-encoded locus and a pseudogene that is present on the long arm of the Y chromosome. Our data in humans and other primates suggest that there has been a pericentric inversion of the Y chromosome during primate evolution that has disrupted the former pseudoautosomal arrangement of these genes. These results provide additional insight into the evolution of the sex chromosomes and into the nature of this interesting portion of the human genome."

Optical sectioning provided a rapid method for three-dimensional resolution of in situ hybridization signals in interphase cells, and solid models were reconstructed from digitized images for detailed rotational studies. There was a dramatic repositioning of the X chromosome in neurons of both males and females in electrophysiologically defined seizure foci. Other chromosomes (1, 9, and Y) showed more subtle positional changes. Specifically altered nuclear patterns involving the X chromosome may become established and create the genetic memory for intractable seizure activity."

https://openalex.org/W1988069145,"The mRNAs for the 80 kd adenovirus preterminal protein (pTP) and the 140 kd DNA polymerase (AdPol) contain several exons spliced to the main open reading frames (m-ORFs) located in the early transcription unit E2B. These proteins were transiently expressed in monkey kidney cells (CV1) utilizing the first ATG (pTP1 and AdPol1) or the ATG of a linker inserted at the beginning of the m-ORFs (pTP2 and AdPol2). Only pTP2 and AdPol2 were functionally active in an in vitro replication initiation assay. Both pTP1 and pTP2 were transported to the nucleus. The sequence RLPV(R)6VP, which is present in both pTPs, is identified as their nuclear localization signal. In contrast, AdPol1 was cytoplasmically localized, whereas AdPol2 was distributed in both compartments, suggesting that the nuclear localization signal for AdPol is within the first 139 amino acids. Interestingly, when AdPol1 and pTP1 or AdPol2 and pTP2 were coexpressed in the transfected cells, the nuclear distribution of AdPol1 or AdPol2 was significantly increased. We demonstrate that the nuclear transport of AdPol is facilitated, irrespective of the presence of its nuclear localization signal, by interaction with pTP."

HTLV-I and HTLV-II use the same cell surface receptor, as shown by interference with syncytium formation and with infection by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes bearing the HTLV envelope glycoproteins. Human-mouse somatic cell hybrids were used to determine which human chromosome was required to confer susceptibility to VSV(HTLV) infection. The only human chromosome common to all susceptible cell hybrids was chromosome 17, and the receptor gene was localized to 17cen-qter. Antibodies to surface antigens known to be determined by genes on 17q did not block the HTLV receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1527588610,"Several clonal rat osteosarcoma cell lines were tested for the ability to express and secrete matrix Gla protein (MGP), a small vitamin K-dependent protein found in bone and cartilage. Two independently derived cell lines, UMR 106-01 and ROS 25/1, expressed MGP mRNA and secreted MGP antigen identical in size with that found in bone. No MGP message could be detected in ROS 17/2 and 2/3 cells, cell lines previously shown to synthesize the other known vitamin K-dependent bone protein, bone Gla protein (BGP), and no BGP mRNA could be detected in the cell lines which synthesize MGP. Since UMR 106-01 and ROS 17/2 are presently the best characterized clonal osteoblastic cell lines, the discovery of the mutually exclusive expression of MGP and BGP by these cell lines indicates that osteosarcoma cells can be fixed in different phenotypic states and that MGP and BGP should be useful markers for the analysis of phenotypic expression in bone. Treatment of UMR 106-01 cells with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) dramatically increased MGP mRNA within 4 h and, by 24 h, increased MGP secretion 15-fold. This is only the second example of a bone matrix protein whose synthesis is dramatically increased by vitamin D, the first being the 6-fold stimulation of BGP synthesis by 1,25(OH)2D3 in ROS 17/2 cells. The discovery that MGP and BGP are similarily regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 was unexpected since the two proteins differ markedly in structure, physical properties, and tissue distribution. Since the synthesis of MGP is rapidly and dramatically increased by 1,25(OH)2D3, it is probable that MGP plays a role in the normal bone response to the hormone. MGP may also be the vitamin K-dependent protein whose abnormal synthesis in the Warfarin-treated animal modifies the bone response to 1,25(OH)2D3."

HIV-expressing cells contained from 300,000 to 2,500,000 copies of viral RNA per cell. Near-synchronous expression of an active infection could be achieved in C8166 cells. In these cells, the high copy numbers of viral RNA used as much as 40% of total protein synthesis for the production of viral gag protein, with high levels of viral RNA and protein synthesis preceding cell death by 2 to 4 days."
https://openalex.org/W2094508092,"Severe heat shocks block the splicing of intervening sequences from messenger RNA precursors. The RNA's that accumulate after a severe heat shock have normal transcription start sites and are uncut at both their 5' and 3' splice junctions. Some of these unspliced transcripts leave the nucleus and enter the pool of cytoplasmic messenger RNA. Translation of these RNA's proceeds into their intervening sequences, resulting in the production of abnormal proteins. Thus, the repression of normal transcription, which usually accompanies the heat shock response, may protect the cell from the large-scale synthesis of abnormal RNA's and aberrant proteins."

Here, we report an intracellular biochemical function of the protein — the capacity to trans-activate selected RNA polymerase II and III-requireing promoters. Since t has failed in the past to bind to DNA and did not stimulate all polymerase II-requiring promoters tested, it likely trans-activates, at least in part, by modifying the activity of selected transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2024756905,"The v-myb, ets-containing avian leukemia virus E26 is unique in its capacity to transform both erythroblasts and myeloblasts. Previous studies showing that v-myb is sufficient for the transformation of myeloid cells failed to definitively establish the role of the v-ets gene. We have now isolated a mutant of E26, ts1.1, that is temperature-sensitive for erythroid cell transformation and that we found to contain a single mutation in the v-ets gene. Surprisingly, myeloid cells transformed by this mutant showed an altered phenotype relative to wild-type-transformed cells, in that they resemble promyelocytes. In addition, infection of mature macrophages with ts1.1 led to their transformation and conversion into promyelocyte-like cells. We conclude that the v-ets domain of the p135gag-myb-ets protein of E26 has an effect on both erythroid and myeloid cell differentiation, suggesting a possible role for the genes in the commitment of hematopoietic cells towards specific lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1602919567,"The mechanism by which the protein kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is activated by binding of growth factor was investigated. Detergent-solubilized receptor in monomeric form was isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and both its kinase and autophosphorylation activities monitored. In a low ionic strength medium and with MnCl2 as an activator, the activity of the monomeric receptor was EGF-independent. However, with 0.25 M ammonium sulfate present, the MnCl2-stimulated kinase activity was strikingly EGF-dependent. In contrast, the kinase activity expressed in the presence of MgCl2 showed growth factor control in the absence of added salt. Under the conditions of these experiments there was apparently little tendency for growth factor to induce aggregation of the receptor, indicating that the allosteric activation of the receptor kinase by EGF occurred via an intramolecular mechanism. Whereas detergent-solubilized receptor was the subject of these studies, the kinase activity of cell surface receptors might also be controlled by an intramolecular mechanism. These results indicate that an individual receptor molecule has the potential to function as a transmembrane signal transducer."
https://openalex.org/W2143588418,"Pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (PS beta G) isolated from human placenta consists of a set of at least three glycoproteins with apparent molecular masses of 72, 64, and 54 kDa, respectively. This heterogeneity is confirmed by the detection of three nonglycosylated polypeptides of 50, 48, and 36 kDa, which can be immunoprecipitated by antiserum to placental PS beta G obtained by in vitro translation of placental poly(A)+ RNA. To examine the structural relationships between these proteins, two cDNA clones of 1912 base pairs (PSG16) and 2131 base pairs (PSG93) encoding human PS beta Gs were isolated from a human placental lambda gt11 cDNA library. The sequenced portions of these two cDNAs are identical with the exception that clone PSG93 contains an additional 86 base pairs at the end of the common 3‘-coding region. This insertion could result in the generation of a PS beta G species of 419 amino acid residues instead of the 417 amino acid residues predicted by the sequence of clone PSG16. The calculated molecular masses of the two polypeptides encoded by PSG16 and PSG93 are 46.9 and 47.2 kDa, close to the size of the major nonglycosylated PS beta G of 48 kDa. The identity of proteins coded for by these cDNA clones was confirmed by comparing the predicted amino acid sequences to sequences determined from endoproteinase Lys-C peptides obtained from human placental PS beta G. Two placental PS beta G mRNAs of 2200 bases (major) and 1700 bases (minor) have been detected by Northern hybridization analysis. Primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping experiments demonstrated that PS beta G mRNAs have heterogeneous 5‘ termini."
https://openalex.org/W1571012244,"The role of the receptor in the transport of diphtheria toxin (DT) to the cytosol was examined. A point-mutant form of DT, CRM 107 (CRM represents cross-reacting material), that has an 8,000-fold lower affinity for the DT receptor than native toxin was conjugated to transferrin and monoclonal antibodies specific for the cell-surface receptors T3 and Thy1. Conjugating the binding site-inactivated CRM 107 to new binding moieties reconstituted full toxicity, indistinguishable from native DT linked to the same ligand, indicating that the entry activity of the DT B chain can be fully separated from the receptor binding function. Like DT, the toxin conjugates exhibited a dose-dependent lag period before first-order inactivation of protein synthesis. Inactivation of the binding site of the toxin portion of the conjugate was found to have no effect on the kinetics of protein synthesis inactivation. The receptor used by the toxin determined the length of the lag period relative to the killing rate. Comparing the potency of CRM 107 conjugates with native DT, standardized for receptor occupancy, shows that new receptors can be as or more efficient than the DT receptor in transporting DT to the cytosol. The transferrin-CRM 107 conjugate, unlike native DT, was highly toxic to murine cells. All the data presented are consistent with a model that the DT receptor, other than initiating rapid internalization of the toxin to low pH compartments, is unnecessary for transport of the toxin to the cytosol and that membrane translocation activity is expressed by the DT B subunit independent of the receptor-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1553606795,"Temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) mutations in the gene for the thermostable P22 tailspike interfere with the polypeptide chain folding and association pathway at restrictive temperature without altering the thermostability of the protein once correctly folded and assembled at permissive temperature. Though the native proteins matured at permissive temperature are biologically active, many of them display alterations in electrophoretic mobility. The native forms of 15 of these tsf mutant proteins have been purified and characterized. The purified proteins differed in electrophoretic mobility and isoelectric point from wild type but did not show evidence of major conformational alterations. The results suggest that the electrophoretic variations conferred by the 15 tsf amino acid substitutions are due to changes in the net charge at solvent-accessible sites in the native form of the mutant protein. During the maturation of the chains at restrictive temperature, these sites influence the conformation of intermediates in chain folding and association. The amino acid sequences at these sites resemble those found at turns in polypeptide chains. The isolation of tsf mutations requires that the mature structure of the tailspike accommodates the mutant amino acid substitution without loss of function. The solvent-accessible sites are probably at the surface of this structural protein. This would explain how bulky mutant substitutions, such as arginines for glycines, are accommodated in the native tailspike structure. Such sites, stabilizing intermediates in the folding pathway and located on the surface of the mature protein, probably represent a general class of conformational substrates for tsf mutations."

Three repeats of the polyadenylation signal hexamer ATTAAA are present prior to the polyadenylate tail. Within the open reading frame is a 10-amino acid fragment which matches exactly the amino acid sequence around the lipoate-lysine residue in bovine kidney branched chain acyltransferase, thus confirming the identity of the cDNA. Analysis of the deduced protein structure for the human branched chain acyltransferase revealed an organization into domains similar to that reported for the acyltransferase proteins of the pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes. This similarity in organization suggests that a more detailed analysis of the proteins will be required to explain the individual substrate and multienzyme complex specificity shown by these acyltransferases."

The alpha- and beta-CGRP gene sequences predict highly related peptides that differ by only a single amino acid. Using rat medullary thyroid carcinoma cells as an in vitro system for testing hormone responsiveness, we have shown that the calcitonin/alpha-CGRP and beta-CGRP genes are differentially regulated. The synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, caused a 2- to 5-fold increase in calcitonin and alpha-CGRP mRNAs due to an increase in the nuclear transcription rate. In contrast, the levels of beta-CGRP mRNA did not significantly change following dexamethasone treatment. Differential regulation within neuroendocrine gene families might be a common mechanism for generating functionally similar peptides in response to a variety of hormonal signals."

https://openalex.org/W2136172217,"Methionine 358 in the plasma protein alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) is an oxidation-sensitive reactive-center residue critical for proteinase-inhibitory activity. Reaction of alpha 1AT with 20 microM to 1.67 mM cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (II) (cis-DDP) or trans-DDP afforded concentration-dependent loss of trypsin-inhibitory activity. This effect, studied by gel electrophoresis and activity assays, is essentially independent of pH over the range 4.9-8.6. Binding assays showed covalent incorporation of 1 mol of cis-DDP into each mol of alpha 1AT. cis-DDP protected a single methionine residue from oxidation and made alpha 1AT resistant to degradation by papain, which cleaves alpha 1AT at Met358. These findings strongly suggest that cis-DDP inactivates alpha 1AT by binding exclusively to its reactive-center methionine. alpha 1AT bound twice as much platinum when reacted with trans-DDP. Because carboxamidomethylated alpha 1AT incorporated nearly 1 mol of both cis- and trans-DDP, the trans isomer apparently binds to both the reactive-center methionine and to the single cysteine residue of alpha 1AT. Because of its greater selectivity, cis-DDP is the superior reagent for modification of the alpha 1AT reactive-center methionine."
https://openalex.org/W1674542260,"The isoprenoid pathway provides several important products for retina function. In this study the sterol and dolichol pathways were investigated in retinas from Rana pipiens in order to assess the contribution of de novo synthesis. Levels of 5.9 +/- 2.0 (n = 13) nmol/retina for squalene, 134 +/- 27 (n = 16) nmol/retina for cholesterol, and 0.14 +/- 0.04 (n = 11) nmol/retina for dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. When whole retinas were incubated with 3H2O, radioactivity was incorporated into compounds which chromatographed on reversed-phase and silica high performance liquid chromatography at the elution positions of squalene, cholesterol, lathosterol, and methyl sterols. From these results, the upper limit for the absolute rate of the sterol pathway was estimated to be 3.4 pmol/h. When retinas were incubated with [3H]acetate, the major labeled product was squalene. The relatively low level of incorporation into cholesterol was apparently due to a substantial pool of squalene which accumulated de novo incorporated [3H]acetate. Dol-P was also labeled with [3H]acetate, and by comparing the ratio of 3H incorporation into Dol-P/squalene with the absolute rate of the sterol pathway, the absolute rate of Dol-P synthesis was determined to be 0.022 pmol/h. Our calculations indicate that the retina does not synthesize sufficient quantities of cholesterol de novo to account for that which is utilized in the biogenesis of rod outer segment membranes."

This is confirmed by diethyl pyrocarbonate footprinting of the complex between antibodies to Z-DNA and the AC-rich region. Osmium tetroxide and hydroxylamine reveal some distortions of the Z double helix in the (GT/CA)n stretch also. The terminal T residues of the stretch are hyperreactive with osmium tetroxide; the terminal left C residues but not the terminal right C residues are hyperreactive with hydroxylamine. Substitution of a few base pairs in the middle of the (GT/CA)n stretch induces also some distortions of the Z double helix. In the GT/CA-rich sequence, distortion of the Z double helix is also supported by the hyperreactivity of osmium tetroxide with several T and C residues."
https://openalex.org/W1592188234,"Abstract Mercenaria myosin and scallop pure hybrid myosin possessing Mercenaria regulatory light chains were reacted with various concentrations of 4-4'-dimaleimidylstilbene-2-2'-disulfonic acid (DMSDS). Regulatory light chain homodimers are formed with great efficiency (20-50%). Dimers incorporating essential light chains were not formed upon reaction of DMSDS with Mercenaria myosin but some (less than 5%) essential light chain homodimers were obtained in the case of scallop hybrid myosin, probably occurring through relatively specific intermolecular associations within small myosin aggregates. Results were invariant, irrespective of the presence or absence of calcium and/or ATP. No radioactivity is incorporated into regulatory light chain homodimers upon post-labeling DMSDS-reacted myosin with 14C-labeled N-ethylmaleimide, irrespective of the original labeling ratio of DMSDS to myosin heads. This indicates the absence of free sulfhydryl groups in the regulatory light chain homodimer and suggests, therefore, that DMSDS links the two light chains together between translationally equivalent residues (Cys-50 of the Mercenaria regulatory light chain). These results imply that translationally equivalent sites on the two heads of myosin can come within 18 A of each other, the span of reacted DMSDS. Because energy transfer results between identical pairs of translationally equivalent sites on hybrid myosins indicated a low efficiency of energy transfer between these sites (Chantler, P.D., and Tao, T. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 192, 87-99), it would appear that even though the two cysteines can come within 18 A of each other, their mean separation is much greater than this distance (greater than 50 A), a result consistent with a considerable flexibility of the two myosin heads with respect to each other."
