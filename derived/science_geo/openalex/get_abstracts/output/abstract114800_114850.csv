https://openalex.org/W1536681507,"Murine prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase-1 and PGH synthase-2 expressed in cos-1 cells were found to be differentially sensitive to inhibition by common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin completely inhibited bis-oxygenation of arachidonate by PGH synthase-1; in contrast, aspirin-treated PGH synthase-2 metabolized arachidonate primarily to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) instead of PGH2. ID50 values were determined for a panel of common NSAIDs by measuring instantaneous inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity using an oxygen electrode. Among common NSAIDs tested, indomethacin, sulindac sulfide, and piroxicam preferentially inhibited PGH synthase-1; ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and meclofenamate inhibited both enzymes with comparable potencies; and 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid preferentially inhibited PGH synthase-2. These results demonstrate that the two PGH synthases are pharmacologically distinct and indicate that it may be possible to develop isozyme-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors useful both for anti-inflammatory therapy and for delineating between the biological roles of the PGH synthase isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1502736133,"Cytotoxic action of membrane lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) is due mainly to its facile reactivity with proteins (Esterbauer, H., Schaur, R. J., and Zollner, H. (1991) Free Radical Biol. Med. 11, 77-80). In the present study, the detailed mechanism of HNE modification of a key enzyme in intermediary metabolism, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is studied mainly focusing on the formation of HNE-amino acid adducts in the enzyme. When GAPDH (1 mg/ml) was treated with 0-2 mM HNE in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h at 37 degrees C, the enzyme was inactivated by HNE in a concentration-dependent manner. The loss of enzyme activity was associated with the loss of free sulfhydryl groups. Following its reduction with NaBH4, amino acid analysis of the HNE-modified enzyme demonstrated that histidine and lysine residues were also modified. At concentrations lower than 0.5 mM, HNE reacts preferentially with cysteine and lysine residues. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the HNE-modified enzyme suggested the formation of intra- and intermolecular cross-links of the enzyme subunit. The HNE-dependent loss of amino acid residues was accompanied by the generation of protein-linked carbonyl derivatives as assessed by reduction with NaB[3H]H4 and reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Thus, the conjugation of all the amino acids appears to involve Michael addition type reactions in which the carbonyl function of HNE would be preserved. The modified histidine residues were quantitatively recovered as the HNE-histidine adduct. However, only 28% of the missing lysine could be accounted for as the HNE-lysine derivative, and only 15.6% of the modified cysteine could be accounted for as the HNE-cysteine thioether derivative. It is proposed that the carbonyl groups of the HNE-derived Michael addition products may undergo secondary reactions with the amino acid groups of lysine residues to yield inter- and intrasubunit cross-links."
https://openalex.org/W1522731616,"The regulation of intracellular pools of Ca2+ was investigated in an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent hematopoietic cell line 32D that undergoes programmed cell death (apoptosis) when deprived of lymphokine. Comparisons were made with 32D cells that had been stably transfected with a bcl-2 expression plasmid that encodes a 26-kDa intracellular integral-membrane protein known to abrogate apoptosis resulting from IL-3 withdrawal. Removal of IL-3 from cultures of 32D cells or control-transfected 32D-NEO cells for 1-2 days led to cell cycle arrest and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and was associated with lower cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i), as measured by Indo-1 fluorescence of viable cells in Ca(2+)-containing media. In bcl-2-expressing 32D-BCL2 cells, IL-3 withdrawal also resulted in cessation of proliferation, but [Ca2+]i levels were not decreased and DNA fragmentation was markedly suppressed. Nonmitochondrial stores of Ca2+ were also significantly diminished in IL-3-deprived 32D-NEO but not in 32D-BCL2 cells, based on measurements of Ca2+ release into the cytosol following exposure of cells to thapsigargin (an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases) under Ca(2+)-free conditions. In contrast, estimates of mitochondrial Ca2+ stores using an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation 1799 (2,6-dihydroxy-1,1,1,7,7,7-he xafluoro-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)heptan-4-one[bis(he xafluoroacetonyl)]acetone) suggested that IL-3 deprivation leads to an increase in this intracellular pool of Ca2+ in 32D-NEO but not in 32D-BCL2 cells. Re-addition of IL-3 to factor-deprived 32D-NEO cells reversed the changes in thapsigargin- and 1799-releasable Ca2+ pools and rescued many of the cells from death. Measurements of total cellular Ca2+ revealed no difference in 32D-NEO cells before and after IL-3 withdrawal, suggesting that the observed alterations in mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial Ca2+ pools result from intracellular repartitioning of Ca2+. Treatment of IL-3-deprived 32D-NEO cells with Ca2+ ionophores blocked DNA fragmentation and prolonged cell survival, whereas addition of Ca2+ chelators to IL-3-stimulated 32D cells resulted in oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and cell death, suggesting that diminutions in the concentrations of Ca2+ in cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, or other intracellular compartments either directly or indirectly regulate apoptosis in these lymphokine-dependent hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1501690710,"The transcriptional regulation of the murine IP-10 gene in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon gamma (IFN gamma)-treated macrophages was investigated by analysis of regions of the gene that flank the transcription start site. A series of sequence fragments were placed 5' to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and ability to mediate transcription of CAT in response to IFN gamma or LPS treatment was studied following transient transfection in the macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7. Analysis of larger constructs identified a potential negative regulatory site for IFN gamma response in the region between nucleotide positions -2002 and -930 and a positive regulator for LPS response in the region between bases -930 and -676. A 227-base fragment spanning positions -228 to -2 was the minimal sequence able to mediate LPS- and IFN gamma-dependent transcription of CAT. Deletion of 24 bases, which included a highly conserved IFN stimulus response element (ISRE) from the -228 construct, abolished response to IFN gamma. A 33-base fragment containing the IP-10 ISRE was able to confer both IFN gamma and LPS sensitivity upon a heterologous promoter. The ability of LPS to stimulate CAT via the ISRE was apparently mediated by intermediate expression of endogenous IFN alpha/beta. Elimination of bases -204 to -102 abolished sensitivity to LPS. This region contains two kappa B binding sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of key nucleotides in the ISRE and the two kappa B sites demonstrated that optimal response to IFN gamma required both the ISRE and one of the two kappa B sites, whereas optimal response to LPS required either both kappa B sites or one kappa B site and the ISRE. IFN gamma or LPS treatment induced sequence-specific binding activity for the ISRE and the two kappa B sites. These results indicate that the 230 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site are important for transcriptional control of the IP-10 gene in response to IFN gamma and LPS. The three defined regulatory elements function in distinct fashion for each of the two stimuli; optimal response to either IFN gamma or LPS requires cooperation between at least two sites."
https://openalex.org/W1509967345,"The hydration of cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids to the corresponding vic-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids by cytosolic epoxide hydrolase demonstrates moderate regioselectivity with rates of hydration highest for the 14,15-epoxide and lower for the 11,12- and 8,9-epoxide (4.5, 1.6, and 1.5 mumol of product/mg of protein/min, respectively). Incubations of the 8,9- and 14,15-epoxides with cytosolic epoxide hydrolase show stereoselective formation of diols (7:3 and 4:1 ratio of antipodes, respectively) and concomitant chiral enrichment of the remaining unmetabolized substrate. In contrast, hydration of the 11,12-epoxide is nonenantioselective. The Km value of the enzyme for the 14(R),15(S)-epoxide is 3 microM. Incubations of the enantiomerically pure 8,9- and 14,15-epoxides with lung or liver cytosol, followed by chiral analysis of the resulting diols demonstrate selective cleavage of the oxirane ring at C9 and C15, respectively. On the other hand, cleavage of the 11,12- oxirane ring was less selective. The stereochemical preference of the cytosolic epoxide hydrolase, together with the known chiral composition of the endogenous arachidonate epoxide pools, suggests a functional role for this enzyme in the metabolism of these important compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1522961358,"Abstract Six mammalian phospholipase C isozymes (PLC-beta 1, PLC-beta 2, PLC-gamma 1, PLC-gamma 2, PLC-delta 1, and PLC-delta 2) have been identified at both protein and DNA levels. Here, cDNAs corresponding to a previously unidentified PLC isozyme were isolated from a rat thyroid cell FRTL cDNA library. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of this new PLC with other known PLC isozymes revealed a high degree of overall similarity with PLC-beta 1 and PLC-beta 2. Thus, the new PLC was named PLC-beta 3. Comparison with PLC-beta 1 and PLC-beta 2 also revealed that the deduced amino-terminal sequence of PLC-beta 3 was incomplete by 10-20 amino acids. With the use of antibodies raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to PLC-beta 3-specific amino acid sequences, we purified PLC-beta 3 from a rat brain particulate fraction. The purified enzyme exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 152 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as compared with 150 and 140 kDa for PLC-beta 1 and PLC-beta 2, respectively. Studies of the activation of PLC-beta isozymes by three alpha subunits of Gq class G proteins, alpha q, alpha 11, and alpha 16 in the presence of guanosine 5-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) revealed that the extent of activation decreased in the order of PLC-beta 1 > or = PLC-beta 3 > PLC-beta 2 for all three alpha subunits, suggesting a certain degree of specificity in the interaction of Gq alpha subunits with different PLC-beta isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1529804537,"Abstract The variation of the selenium status of leukocytes was used as a tool to investigate the influence of selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases on the formation of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites in vitro and ex vivo. Selenium-deficient rat basophilic leukemia cells had < 1% of control glutathione peroxidase activity and 35% of control phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity. Upon stimulation, these cells released an 8-fold amount of lipoxygenase metabolites compared to controls. No (5S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid was detectable in whole cells; however, it was found in homogenates of selenium-deficient cells. Addition of 0.25 microgram/ml selenium to selenium-deficient cells restored control phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity within 8 h, whereas glutathione peroxidase activity needed 7 days. 12 h after resupplementation, selenium-deficient cells had 3% glutathione peroxidase and 100% phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity compared to controls. Resupplemented cells released control amounts of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites, indicating that restoration of phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity is associated with a selenium-adequate leukotriene metabolism. Leukocytes that were isolated from selenium-deficient rats released a 7-fold amount of total lipoxygenase metabolites compared to cells from control animals. By injecting normally fed rats with 500 micrograms/kg selenium as Na2SeO3, leukocyte phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity was raised 8-fold within 114 h compared to controls. Leukocytes from these animals produced significantly less lipoxygenase metabolites than controls. These findings indicate that phospholipid hydroperoxide-glutathione peroxidase activity is primarily responsible for the reduction of 5-hydroperoxyeicosate-traenoic acid and therefore governs the actual activity of leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase via regulating the tone of endogenous hydroperoxides."
https://openalex.org/W1490486327,"A novel 66-kDa protein, named p66mot-1, is identified to be associated with cellular mortality by virtue of its presence in cytosolic fractions of serially passaged mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and the mortal hybrids obtained by the fusion of mortal (MEF) and immortal (MN48-1, derivative of NIH 3T3) cells. Immortal cells lack this protein in their cytosolic fractions. cDNA cloning and homology search placed it in the heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) family. Microinjection of anti-p66 antibody to senescent MEF could transiently stimulate their cell division, which supports the cellular mortality-related function of p66mot-1."
https://openalex.org/W1638673169,"Turbidity measurements of the kinetics of human calcitonin (hCT) fibrillation showed a linear dependence of the logarithm of fibrillation time (the time the sample is not fibrillated) and the logarithm of hCT concentration. This ln/ln plot linearity and electron microscope observations of fibrils indicate that the fibrillation process can be explained by the double nucleation mechanism that was proposed for the gelation of sickle cell hemoglobin (Ferrone, F. A., Hofrichter, J., Sunshine, H. R., and Eaton, W. A. (1980) Biophys. J. 32, 361-380). Circular dichroism, fluorescence, and infrared spectroscopy studies of fibrils showed that hCT molecules have alpha-helical and beta-sheet secondary structure components. A model for the structure of hCT molecules in fibrils is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1550332341,"Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor were transfected with cDNAs encoding protein kinase C isoenzymes alpha, beta I, gamma, and epsilon as well as an inactive alpha. Overexpression of these protein kinase Cs did not affect expression of the insulin receptor or insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. However, in response to phorbol esters, cells overexpressing isoenzymes alpha, beta I, and gamma, but not epsilon or inactive alpha, exhibited 3-4-fold higher levels of insulin receptor phosphorylation. This increased phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serines and threonine. Tryptic peptide maps indicated that this phosphorylation was primarily on serines 1305/1306 and threonine 1348 as well as several other unidentified sites. This phorbol ester-stimulated phosphorylation did not inhibit activation of the insulin receptor kinase when the receptor was activated in situ but assayed in vitro. However, in cells overexpressing protein kinase C alpha, it did inhibit an in vivo monitor of the activation of the insulin receptor kinase, the insulin-stimulated increase in anti-phosphotyrosine-precipitable phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. These results indicate that increased protein kinase C alpha activity can inhibit insulin-stimulated responses and support the hypothesis that excessive protein kinase C is involved in the insulin resistance observed in non-insulin-dependent diabetics."
https://openalex.org/W1822797028,"A new modular in vivo/in vitro expression system was constructed which facilitates studies of the control and regulation of gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We studied the influence of stem-loop structures inserted into the non-translated leader region upon the steady-state levels and translation of mRNAs bearing the cat gene from the bacterial transposon Tn9. mRNA abundance changed relatively little in response to alterations in the leader sequence and structure, whereas stem-loop structures clearly inhibited translation to a degree that was dependent upon the predicted stability as well as the position of the inserted secondary structure. A stem-loop structure with a predicted stability greater than -28 kcal mol-1 and with a stem comprising at least 15 (mainly G/C) base pairs inhibited translation in vivo by at least 98%. A stem-loop structure with a predicted stability of approximately -14 kcal mol-1, whose stem comprised at least six G/C base pairs, inhibited translation in vivo by at least 66%. The hairpins were more inhibitory when placed close to the start codon than when positioned near the 5' end of the leader. An mRNA showing extensive complementarity between the leader and trailer regions was not only poorly translated but also had a steady-state level at least three times higher than the average for all the cat constructs examined. Translation of the various mRNAs in a yeast cell-free system followed qualitatively the same pattern as the results obtained in vivo. The stem-loop structures were far less inhibitory in a reticulocyte lysate system. Overall, the data are likely to reflect the full spectrum of translational activities of yeast mRNAs in vivo determined by secondary structure and emphasize the importance of translation as a control step in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1872451420,"We report the molecular cloning and characterization of a 49-kDa form of casein kinase I from rat testis. A cDNA clone encoding the enzyme, designated casein kinase I delta, contained an open reading frame of 1284 nucleotides that predicts a polypeptide of 428 amino acids with a M(r) of 49,121. The predicted amino acid sequence shares 76% identity with casein kinase I alpha, a 37-kDa form recently cloned from bovine brain (Rowles, J., Slaughter, C., Moomaw, C., Hsu, J., and Cobb, M. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 9548-9552), and 65% identity with HRR25, a 57-kDa form of casein kinase I from yeast shown to be involved in DNA repair (Hoekstra, M. F., Liskay, R. M., Ou, A. C., DeMaggio, A. J., Burbee, D. G., and Heffron, F. (1991) Science 253, 1031-1034). Northern analysis of rat or rabbit RNA revealed three hybridizing species of 3.5-4.1, 2.2, and 1.9 kilobase pairs (kb). The largest message was detected in all tissues examined, whereas the 1.9- and 2.2-kb species were found predominantly in testis. A probe corresponding to the 3'-untranslated region of the casein kinase I delta cDNA hybridized only to the 1.9-kb transcript. Expression of the casein kinase I delta cDNA in Escherichia coli resulted in active enzyme that phosphorylated casein, phosvitin, and the peptide substrate DDDDVASLPGLRRR. Enzyme activity was associated with a predominant polypeptide of 55-kDa, although COOH-terminal degradation products of 50 and 42 kDa were also present in partially purified enzyme. Recombinant casein kinase I delta was inhibited by the specific casein kinase I inhibitor, CKI-7, half-maximally at 12 microM. Heparin inhibited recombinant casein kinase I delta when phosvitin was the substrate, with half-maximal inhibition at 11.5 micrograms/ml. However, if the peptide substrate was used, heparin activated recombinant casein kinase I delta 4-5-fold, with half-maximal activation at 9.5 micrograms/ml. A truncated form of casein kinase I delta, lacking the COOH-terminal 111 amino acids, was no longer activated by heparin. Casein kinase I delta therefore represents a separate member of the casein kinase I family distinguished by its larger size and unique kinetic behavior with respect to heparin."
https://openalex.org/W61176855,"UV irradiated cells release into the culture medium factors that induce, when given to nonirradiated cells, the transcription of several UV-inducible genes (collagenase I, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, metallothionein IIA). We identify here the active factors released from UV-treated HeLa cells, as interleukin 1 alpha and basic fibroblast growth factor. UV irradiation leads to increased mRNA levels for both factors and to their enhanced synthesis. Experiments with the drug suramin, which inhibits growth factor-growth factor receptor interactions and with antibodies directed against interleukin 1 alpha and basic fibroblast growth factor, suggest that growth factors do not only transduce the UV-induced signal to nonirradiated cells but act on the producer cell thus establishing an obligatory growth factor loop for at least part of the UV response."
https://openalex.org/W1552551253,"BNBD-12, a prototype beta-defensin peptide from bovine neutrophils, was chosen for determination of the disulfide motif in this family of tridisulfide antimicrobial peptides. Disulfide-containing fragments of BNBD-12 were generated by incubation with trypsin, and the amino acid composition of one tryptic fragment allowed for the assignment of one of the three disulfides. The remaining two disulfides, contained in a 16-residue tryptic oligopeptide, were characterized by amino acid analysis of fragments generated by a single round of Edman degradation which cleaved the Cys-Cys peptide bond present near the carboxyl terminus of BNBD-12. Cleavage of this bond produced two disulfide-containing oligopeptides, the compositions of which provided unambiguous assignments of the disulfides involved. The cystine motif in BNBD-12 differs from that of classical defensins, and indicates that the beta-defensins and defensins must have differently folded chains, though they share several functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W1552058470,"Interaction of interferon alpha (IFN alpha) with its cell surface receptor rapidly activates the formation of the transcription complex ISGF3, which subsequently translocates to the nucleus and stimulates the expression of a variety of early response genes. We have recently developed a cell-free system where IFN alpha can activate the formation of ISGF3 in vitro. This system has enabled us to demonstrate that the component of the ISGF3 transcription complex which is modified by IFN alpha treatment (ISGF3 alpha) is membrane-associated and that its activation involves a protein kinase. Using a combination of specific tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies we now are able to demonstrate that IFN alpha-activated transcription involves at least a two-step process where a membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase and a tyrosine kinase lead to modification of ISGF3 alpha and subsequent formation of the complete complex. Furthermore, formation of the ISGF3 complex is specifically disrupted by protein tyrosine phosphatase and can be reversibly dissociated by the phosphotyrosine analogue phenylphosphate. The latter observation suggested that SH2 and/or SH3 domains may be required for the stable formation of this transcription complex."
https://openalex.org/W1561297384,"The assembly of specific multiprotein complexes on the herpes simplex virus alpha/IE (immediate early) enhancer elements requires the interactions of the Oct-1 POU homeodomain, the viral alpha TIF (alpha-trans-induction factor) (VP16), and at least one additional cellular factor, the C1 factor. The C1 factor interacts directly with alpha TIF, likely forming an intermediate protein complex that recognizes the Oct-1 homeodomain-DNA complex. The biochemical purification of the mammalian C1 factor suggests that it is composed of multiple subunits of related, but heterogeneous, polypeptides. The interaction of a subset of these polypeptides with alpha TIF is stimulated by post-translational modifications of the C1 proteins, suggesting that this factor may be a critical target for the regulation of the herpes simplex virus alpha/IE transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2121795850,"In previous studies we have identified a cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase (CytPTK) in rat adipocytes that is largely activated in vanadate-pretreated cells (Shisheva, A., and Shechter, Y. (1992) FEBS Lett. 300, 93-96). We report here that staurosporine and its analog K-252a are highly potent (ID50 = 3 and 100 nM, respectively) in inhibiting CytPTK activity of crude cell extract or partially purified enzyme preparations. Staurosporine and K-252a were less effective by more than 2 and 1 orders of magnitude, respectively, in inhibiting insulin receptor-catalyzed PolyGlu4Tyr phosphorylation in cell-free experiments. Preincubation of rat adipocytes with either staurosporine or K-252a selectively blocked the action of vanadate in activating glucose incorporation into lipids and its oxidation. Thus, staurosporine inhibited vanadate-stimulated lipogenesis and glucose oxidation (via glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway) in a concentration-dependent manner with ID50 of 75 and 300 nM, respectively. Insulin-stimulated bioeffects were not inhibited at this low range of staurosporine concentration. Staurosporine had no effect on vanadate-stimulated hexose uptake or on vanadate's antilipolytic action. Using staurosporine, we probed those insulinomimetic agents which facilitate their biological activity via the insulin receptor kinase (insulin, wheat germ agglutinin, concanavalin A, and pervanadate) or via CytPTK (vanadate and to a certain degree Mn2+ and Zn2+). These results suggest that (a) vanadate facilitates its insulin-like actions on glucose utilization via the cytosolic tyrosine kinase and (b) this enzyme does not participate in vanadate effects in stimulating hexose uptake and in inhibiting lipolysis. These findings explain further vanadate's post-insulin receptor actions and raise possible application in the management of glucose metabolism in insulin-independent fashion in pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1510045598,"We have determined the primary genomic and cDNA sequences encoding the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) enzyme of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (dihydrofolate reductase, EC 1.5.1.3; thymidylate synthase EC 2.1.1.45). The DHFR-TS gene of T. gondii (strain RH) spans more than 6 kilobases of genomic DNA. Unlike the DHFR-TS genes of other protists, sequences encoding the Toxoplasma protein are interrupted by numerous intervening sequences. Analysis of processed T. gondii DHFR-TS cDNAs reveals a single open reading frame of 1830 nucleotides, predicting a 610-amino acid protein of molecular mass of 69 kilodaltons. Because its nucleotide composition and codon usage are roughly comparable to those observed in higher eukaryotes, the Toxoplasma DHFR-TS sequence is particularly useful for assessing evolutionary relationships between eukaryotic species. The predicted amino acid sequence for the DHFR-TS protein shows conservation of the major structural features identified in other DHFR and TS enzymes, while revealing certain differences which may be exploited for the design of novel antifolates for treatment of toxoplasmosis associated with AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1569627963,"A cDNA clone (pTE-83) encoding a protein (CNX1p) related to the microsomal Ca(2+)-binding protein, calnexin, was isolated from an Arabidopsis thaliana expression library. Southern and Northern hybridization indicated that CNX1 is a single-copy gene encoding a message of 1900 nucleotides. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide with 530 amino acids, a molecular mass of 60.5 kDa, and overall 48% identity to dog calnexin. Both animal calnexin and CNX1p contain a large luminal domain followed by a single potential membrane-spanning domain near the C terminus and a small C-terminal domain exposed to the cytoplasm. The in vitro translation product from the cloned cDNA yielded a polypeptide of 67 kDa that was co-translationally imported into dog microsomes and processed to a 64-kDa product. Antibodies generated against the C-terminal half of the protein cross-react with an identically sized protein present in the microsomal fraction from Arabidopsis. Both the imported and native proteins are cleaved by trypsin to a 59-kDa product indicating that the gene product was indeed correctly processed and translocated into dog microsomes and that the membrane topology of CNX1p resembles that of dog calnexin. The presence of a calnexin-like protein within the plant kingdom indicates that this protein is widespread and involved in processes fundamental to all eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1564714106,"Recombinant soluble human interleukin-5 receptor alpha (shIL-5R alpha) has been expressed in COS-1 cells and in baculovirus-infected cells. The protein was purified from the supernatant by chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose, MonoQ, and a final gel filtration step. A chimeric fusion receptor protein (hIL-5R alpha-h gamma 3) was constructed by fusion of the cDNA corresponding to the shIL-5R alpha to the cDNA corresponding to the Fc part of the human IgG C gamma 3 chain, and was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. The chimeric receptor was secreted as a disulfide-linked homodimer, and was purified by protein G affinity chromatography. In a solid-phase binding assay the shIL-5R alpha and the bivalent hIL-5R alpha-h gamma 3 were found to bind hIL-5 with a similar affinity, corresponding to the membrane-bound, low affinity hIL-5R alpha. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of shIL-5R alpha cross-linked to radiolabeled hIL-5, suggested that one shIL-5R alpha molecule binds to one hIL-5 homodimer molecule. Gel filtration studies of the complex formed between the shIL-5R alpha and hIL-5 pointed toward the same stoichiometry of binding. The formation of such a complex could be observed by electrophoresis in native gels. Immunoaffinity chromatography using a non-neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against hIL-5, followed by size column chromatography, allowed the purification of the complex. The data obtained from the amino acid analysis of the constituents of the complex blotted from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and from the amino acid composition of the complex blotted from a native polyacrylamide gel, provided direct evidence that the shIL-5R alpha binds the hIL-5 dimer in a 1:1 ratio."
https://openalex.org/W1548549754,"The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase)-related cDNA from a template of total RNA isolated from human skeletal muscle. A novel PTPase, which we term PTP-PEST, was detected by this method. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was used to screen two different HeLa cell libraries to obtain full length cDNA clones. The cDNA predicts a protein of 510 amino acids, approximately 60 kDa, that does not contain an obvious signal sequence or transmembrane segment suggesting it is a nonreceptor type enzyme. The PTPase domain is located in the N-terminal portion of the molecule and displays approximately 35% identity to other members of this family of enzymes. The C-terminal segment is rich in Pro, Glu, Asp, Ser, and Thr residues, possessing features of PEST motifs which have previously been identified in proteins with very short intracellular half-lives. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion product with glutathione S-transferase. Intrinsic activity was demonstrated in vitro against a variety of phosphotyrosine-containing substrates including BIRK, the autophosphorylated cytoplasmic kinase domain of the insulin receptor beta subunit. It did not dephosphorylate phosphoseryl-phosphorylase a. PTP-PEST mRNA is broadly distributed in a variety of cell lines. Stimulation of human rhabdomyosarcoma A204 cells, a transformed muscle line, with insulin led to an approximately 4-fold induction of PTP-PEST mRNA within 36 h."
https://openalex.org/W191732070,"The allene oxide synthase (hydroperoxide dehydrase) of flaxseed is a cytochrome P450 that exhibits an exceptionally high catalytic turnover (> or = 1000/s) for hydroperoxy substrates. In a previous study, using a crude extract of flaxseed, we detected a secondary activity that could offer an insight into the mechanism of the enzymatic transformation of hydroperoxides. We observed that the substrate 8R-hydroxy-15S-hydroperoxyeicosa-5,9,11,13,17-pentaenoic acid is converted not only to allene oxide, but also to epoxyalcohol derivatives (Brash, A. R., Baertschi, S. W., and Harris, T. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6705-6712). The transformation of hydroperoxides to epoxyalcohols has been investigated extensively in other systems, and heterolytic or homolytic cleavage of the hydroperoxide is associated with characteristic rearrangements and stereochemistry of the epoxyalcohol products. Using the purified enzyme, we established that the epoxyalcohols are products of the allene oxide synthase. Their structures were determined by UV, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and NMR. The major epoxyalcohol is 8R,13R-dihydroxy-14R,15S-epoxyeicosa-5Z,9E ,11Z,17Z-tetraenoic acid, a trans-epoxide with an alpha-hydroxyl in the relative threo configuration. Two minor products are the corresponding 11E isomer and a cis-epoxide identified as 8R,13-dihydroxy-14S,15S-epoxyeicosa-5Z,9E,11E,++ +17Z-tetraenoic acid. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of a reaction with [18O2]hydroperoxide substrate indicated complete retention of the hydroperoxy oxygens in the epoxyalcohol products. Mechanistic precedents support a homolytic hydroperoxide cleavage as the initial step in the synthesis of these epoxyalcohols. We suggest that the same process initiates allene oxide synthesis, a conclusion that is also most compatible with the known chemistry of cytochromes P450."
https://openalex.org/W1575452790,"The effects of human recombinant interleukin (IL)-1 beta on elastin gene expression were studied in human skin fibroblast cultures by Northern hybridization and transient transfection experiments. Incubation of the cells with IL-1 beta elevated the elastin mRNA steady-state levels by approximately 3- to 4-fold. A similar increase was noted at the protein level, when estimated by indirect immunofluorescence of cultured cells. This effect was independent of the on-going protein synthesis, as tested by incubation with cycloheximide. Transient transfections of the dermal fibroblasts with a human elastin promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene construct suggested transcriptional regulation, since the CAT activity in cells incubated with IL-1 beta was similarly increased approximately 3-fold. Enhancement of the human elastin promoter activity by IL-1 beta was also noted in fibroblast cultures established from the skin and lungs of transgenic mice which have integrated the human promoter/CAT construct into their genome and express it in a tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, subcutaneous injection of IL-1 beta to the mice resulted in a approximately 4-fold elevation of the CAT activity in the skin after a 30-h incubation, as compared to the CAT activity in the skin of control animals. Collectively, these data indicate that IL-1 beta up-regulates elastin gene expression in fibroblast cultures as well as in the skin in vivo, and the activation occurs at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1645508674,"Many membrane proteins are anchored to the cell surface through covalent attachment to a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) structure. The GPI anchor is added to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum following recognition of a signal in the COOH terminus of the protein. We show that the GPI anchoring signal can be completely recreated by the synthetic polymer Ser3-Thr8-Leu14, but not Thr11-Leu14, inserted at the COOH terminus of a protein. This is consistent with previous reports that a small amino acid such as Ser, Gly, or Ala, but not Thr, is required at the GPI attachment site. Analysis of synthetic amino acid sequences established a basic three-part signal for GPI anchoring: a cleavage/attachment domain that requires small amino acids at the first (GPI anchor attachment) and third positions but with little specificity at the middle position, a spacer domain of approximately 8-12 amino acids, and a hydrophobic domain of at least 11 amino acids. The ability to design a totally synthetic GPI anchoring signal will allow precise probing of the fine structure of this signal."
https://openalex.org/W1520390436,"Abstract The inhibitory neuropeptide somatostatin (SRIF) initiates many of its physiological effects by binding to membrane receptors which are coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein(s). We have solubilized such a SRIF receptor-G-protein complex and purified it using a biotinylated SRIF analog and guanine nucleotide-dependent affinity chromatography. Following [125I-Tyr11]SRIF binding to membranes from AR4-2J pancreatic acinar cells, only two detergents, dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside (D beta M) and sucrose monolaureate, extracted greater than 70% of the prebound peptide in association with receptor. The D beta M-solubilized ligand-receptor complex was extremely stable: the half-time (t1/2) for dissociation was 11 days at 4 degrees C. However, guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (10 microM) elicited rapid dissociation of the [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-receptor complex (t1/2 < 30 s), and this effect was concentration-dependent (ED50 = 4.0 + 0.3 nM). [125I-Tyr11]SRIF dissociation was also stimulated by GDP (ED50 = 4.1 +/- 0.3 microM), and the potency of GDP was increased 4-fold by 30 microM AlF4-. Thus, the solubilized receptor was functionally associated with G-proteins. Cross-linking of the soluble [125I-Tyr11]SRIF-receptor complex resulted in the covalent labeling of a 70-90-kDa band, the same band that was specifically labeled in membranes. Affinity purification of the SRIF receptor-G-protein complex was accomplished by prebinding a biotinylated SRIF analog, [N-biotinyl-Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25]SRIF28, to membranes followed by solubilization of the ligand-receptor-G-protein complex, adsorption to streptavidin-agarose, and specific elution with 100 microM GDP, 30 microM AlF4-. G-proteins were identified in the eluate by immunoblotting with specific antipeptide antisera. Using this protocol, the G-protein subunits alpha i, alpha i-3, and beta 36 were shown to be specifically associated with the AR4-2J cell SRIF receptor. Thus, we have developed a new, generally applicable, procedure for the efficient solubilization and affinity purification of a stable SRIF receptor-G-protein complex and have characterized the specific G-protein subunits associated with pancreatic SRIF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1519381038,"Direct measurements of the binding between light-activated rhodopsin (Rho*) and transducin, the retinal rod G-protein, revealed a strongly cooperative interaction. Cooperativity was assessed by measuring the association of 125I-labeled transducin (Gt) to Rho* in urea-stripped rod outer segment membranes at equilibrium. Analysis of 125I-Gt binding curves gave a Hill coefficient of 1.8. These data were consistent with a two-site model in which binding of the first 125I-Gt to Rho* increased the binding of the second 125I-Gt approximately 40-fold (Kd values were 80 +/- 30 and 1.9 +/- 0.7 nM, respectively). The effects of GDP on the binding were also investigated. GDP decreased the affinity between Rho* and Gt approximately 100-fold but did not decrease the degree of cooperativity. Binding curves of 125I-Gt in the presence of 1 mM GDP showed a Hill coefficient of 1.9. The data were also consistent with a two-binding site model in which binding of the first 125I-Gt increased the binding of the second 125I-Gt approximately 70-fold (Kd values were 13.7 +/- 5.4 and 0.20 +/- 0.08 microM, respectively). The Gt alpha subunit in the absence of Gt beta gamma also bound Rho* in a cooperative manner. These data implicate a role for the cooperative association of Rho* and Gt in the light activation cascade of retinal rods."
https://openalex.org/W1549823484,"The Lec35 mutation (previously designated PIR) of Chinese hamster ovary cells is a recessive mutation that affects the participation of mannose-P-dolichol (MPD) in dolichol-P-P-oligosaccharide biosynthesis in vivo, even though MPD and the respective MPD-dependent mannosyltransferases are present. The Lec35 phenotype can be partially corrected by disrupting Lec35 cells and performing the transferase reactions in vitro, suggesting that the defect may be related to mislocalization of MPD. In this study, we examined the effect of the Lec35 mutation on glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid biosynthesis, another pathway that requires MPD. Our data indicate that the first mannosylation reaction of GPI lipid biosynthesis is defective in Lec35 cells, with the accumulation of glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol having a fatty acyl group on inositol and a base-resistant alkyl group attached to glycerol. The same intermediate accumulates in Lec15 (MPD synthase-defective) cells. The defective mannosylation reaction of Lec35 cells was corrected in vitro and shown to require MPD. These results demonstrate that the Lec35 gene governs a general aspect of MPD metabolism affecting both GPI lipid and dolichol-P-P-oligosaccharide biosynthesis. To provide additional insight into the role of the Lec35 gene, we give evidence for an inefficient pool of MPD in Lec35 membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2100194092,"We have isolated and sequenced genomic clones from the DNA of Saponaria officinalis using a cDNA probe that encodes proteins with high homology to saporin-6, one of the most potent of the ribosome-inactivating proteins that is currently used for the construction of immunotoxins and mitotoxins. Sequence differences in the clones suggest a multigene family of proteins. These data agree with observations of several different proteins with ribosome-inactivating protein activity and similar structure. Two of the genomic clones encode proteins that have identical sequences to two of the four isoforms of saporin-6. We have inserted the DNA from one genomic clone into an Escherichia coli expression system that encodes a signal sequence for export to the bacterial periplasmic space. Exportation is observed and the isolated gene product has ribosome-inactivation activity similar to the native protein. Sequence analysis shows differential processing of the remaining plant signal sequence. The majority of the expressed protein remains intracellular and this material also shows high specific activity and differential processing. Saporin as an immunotoxin in clinical trial and as a mitotoxin in experimental models has been extremely efficacious. These data indicate the ability to produce fusion proteins with saporin and cell-binding ligands for production of new reagents for further clinical and experimental use."
https://openalex.org/W1586270086,"A diagnostic feature of P-ATPases is a phosphorylation motif (DKTGTLT), located in the hydrophilic center of the polypeptide chain, within which the beta-aspartyl-phosphate reaction intermediate is formed. The roles of four invariant residues (Lys379, Thr380, Thr382, and Thr384) in this region of the yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase have been analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, a set of six insertion mutants was generated containing a single glycine residue at each of the indicated sites: [sequence: see text] C S D K T GT LT to examine spatial arrangements within this highly conserved domain. In order to minimize toxic effects of the mutations on cell growth, the defective ATPases were expressed behind an inducible heat shock promoter and targeted to an intracellular pool of secretory vesicles, while wild-type ATPase was maintained in the plasma membrane where it is required for viability. Secretory vesicles containing mutant ATPase were isolated as described previously (Nakamoto, R. K., Rao, R., and Slayman, C. W. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7940-7949) and assayed for the amount of ATPase polypeptide and for rates of ATP hydrolysis and H+ pumping. All of the insertion mutations led to biosynthetic arrest of the defective enzyme, with no ATPase appearing in the secretory vesicles. Nonconservative amino acid substitutions (Lys-->Gln, Thr-->Ala) inactivated the ATPase, whereas conservative substitutions (Lys-->Arg, Thr-->Ser) retained partial activity which has been characterized in detail. There was little or no change in the Km for ATP or the pH optimum in any of the mutant enzymes. Strikingly, however, all displayed an increase in resistance to vanadate, consistent with the idea that the residues in question contribute to a phosphate/vanadate binding site or that they affect the equilibrium between E1 and E2 conformations of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1525152404,"Protein-mediated sugar transport is nominally absent in normoxic pigeon erythrocytes. Following exposure to metabolic inhibitors (cyanide or carbonyl-cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), pigeon red cells transport sugars by a saturable stereoselective pathway that is inhibited by cytochalasin B or forskolin. The sugar transport capacity of fully poisoned cells is consistent with a transporter density of approximately 30 carriers/erythrocyte. Immunoblot analyses and competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicate that pigeon red cells contain approximately 200 copies of an integral plasma membrane protein immunologically related to the glucose transporter isoform GLUT1. GLUT1 is quantitatively restricted to the plasma membrane at all times. Pigeon red cells and brain lack proteins immunologically related to the sugar transporter isoforms GLUT3 and GLUT4. Specific immunodepletion of red cell GLUT1 content results in the subsequent loss of reconstitutable protein-mediated sugar transport. These findings demonstrate that avian erythrocyte sugar transport is mediated by a GLUT1-like sugar transport protein and that sugar transport stimulation by metabolic depletion results from derepression of cell surface sugar transport proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1570486561,"Cholera toxin and Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) exert their effects on cells through ADP-ribosylation of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. Both toxins consist of one A subunit, which is an ADP-ribosyltransferase, and five B (or binding) subunits. Their enzymatic activities are latent; activation requires reduction and proteolysis, resulting in a catalytically active A1 protein and a much smaller A2 protein. These ADP-ribosyltransferases are activated by GTP-dependent 20-kDa ADP-ribosylation factors or ARFs. To determine if proteolysis plus reduction is required for appearance of the ARF allosteric site as well as for catalytic activity, an inactive mutant of LT, LT(E112K), with replacement of glutamate by lysine at position 112 of its A subunit, was utilized as a competitor in cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase assays containing limiting amounts of ARF. LT(E112K) required trypsinization and reduction to become a potent, concentration-dependent inhibitor. Inhibition was reversed by increasing concentrations of ARF. Reduction or trypsinization alone did not generate an inhibitory form of LT(E112K). These studies are consistent with the conclusion that the ARF site is not expressed in the latent toxin. Both trypsinization and reduction are required for expression of a functional ARF binding site as well as for catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1513679104,"Abstract Body-wall muscle tropomyosin (Tm) of a marine chordate, the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, was studied by protein and cDNA clone analyses. Our results indicate that body-wall muscle of Ciona contains one major Tm isoform encoded by a single gene. Unexpectedly, the sequence of this Tm resembles vertebrate-striated muscle Tm isoforms, rather than those of smooth muscle or nonmuscle tissues, despite the fact that body-wall muscle is a nonsarcomeric (i.e. smooth) muscle. We also found that an apparently identical Tm isoform, derived from the same gene, is expressed at high levels in Ciona heart, a striated muscle. This is the first example of an organism in which a single Tm isoform is prominently expressed in both and non-sarcomeric tissues. Our results demonstrate that the characteristic features of sarcomeric Tm isoforms are not primarily related to ultrastructure per se. Instead, because ascidian body-wall muscle, unlike vertebrate smooth muscle, contains troponin, we suggest that it is the interaction with troponin that generates the selective pressure to maintain the characteristic C-terminal structure of so-called Tm isoforms. Our results further document the remarkable molecular similarity between the nonsarcomeric ascidian body-wall muscle and vertebrate-striated muscle. We suggest that these muscle types represent and nonsarcomeric variants of a fundamental class of troponin/Tm-regulated muscles, contrary to the traditional smooth/striated classification of muscle types. The possible relationship of this class of muscle to vertebrate smooth muscle is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1589386825,"The cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (cAspAT) gene is ubiquitously expressed but it is regulated by hormones in a tissue-specific manner. In vitro DNase I footprinting studies of a 260-base pair fragment carrying the basal promoter activity revealed that three CCAAT sequences bind liver nuclear proteins (protected regions P2, P3, P4). Competition studies, the heat resistance of these proteins, and identical footprints obtained using a recombinant CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) alpha fragment indicate that they belong to the C/EBP family of transcription factors. A fourth protected region P1, overlapping the P2 region, was observed in the liver in the presence of competing oligonucleotides containing the C/EBP site. In cotransfection experiments, the C/EBP beta protein trans-activated 10-15-fold the cAspAT gene promoter in HepG2 cells. Deletion studies revealed that regions P2 and P4 are critical for promoter activity. In gel retardation experiments, the P4 region bound different C/EBP-related proteins in different tissues: the brain protein is heat sensitive in contrast to the liver protein. The synthetic oligonucleotide OL 1-2, which covers the P1 and P2 regions, binds C/EBP-like proteins as well as NF1 and CP1 (or NFY) transcription factors, but the preferential binding of one of these protein is tissue-specific. In summary, using the cAspAT gene promoter, we have shown that ubiquitously active promoters may be recognized by different proteins in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1593158365,"Abstract We have investigated the molecular and biochemical basis for activation of interleukin 3 (IL3) gene expression in primary human T lymphocytes following CD3 and CD2 receptor stimulation or activation by phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Using transfection and reporter gene assays specifically designed for primary T lymphocytes in conjunction with gel retardation assays, Western blot analyses and UV cross-linking studies, we found that c-Jun, c-Fos, and octamer-binding proteins play a major role in transcriptional activation of the IL3 gene via their interaction with two specific regions contained within the IL3 5'-flanking sequence. Additionally, the region between bases -107 and -59 of the IL3 promoter containing putative AP-2 and Sp1 binding motifs appears necessary for basal level expression of the IL3 gene. The data also indicate that CD2 receptor activation and phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation augment T cell IL3 gene expression through the same cis- and trans-activating signals. These results should contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of IL3 gene expression in human T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1552233751,"An Escherichia coli mutant multienzyme complex of fatty acid oxidation, composed of two 41-kDa beta-subunits and two 79-kDa mutant alpha-subunits with the alpha/Gly116-->Phe substitution, has been overproduced and purified. The catalytic properties of 3-ketoacyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thiolase and L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were found to be virtually identical with those of the wild type, whereas both enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase activities were eliminated by the alpha/Gly116-->Phe mutation. delta 3-cis-delta 2-trans-Enoyl-CoA isomerase was only slightly affected by the mutation. The results of this study, together with the sequence analysis of the large alpha-subunit of the E. coli complex (Yang, X.-Y. H., Schulz, H., Elzinga, M., and Yang, S.-Y. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 6788-6795) and a demonstration of the epimerization of D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs in E. coli via a dehydration/hydration mechanism (Smeland, T. E., Cuebas, D., and Schulz, H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23904-23908), lead to the conclusion that enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase are associated with a common active site in the amino-terminal domain of the multifunctional fatty acid oxidation protein. Thus the E. coli hydratase and epimerase activities represent two functions of a unique crotonase that converts both L- and D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs to 2-trans-enoyl-CoAs. Moreover, the results suggest that the amino-terminal domain of the large alpha-subunit is also involved in the isomerase activity but the key residue(s) required for catalyzing the isomerization is distinct from the crotonase."
https://openalex.org/W1577144693,"The involvement of ATP during transcription initiation from three basic types of RNA polymerase II promoters was investigated. Hydrolysis of the beta-gamma bond of ATP was found to be required for transcription at TATA, initiator, and initiator + TATA promoters. For all three promoters, ATP is required to melt the transcription start site region during formation of a functional open transcription complex. The use of ATP to open the DNA strands occurs rapidly. The resulting open complex is transient, since the start site re-closes rapidly upon initiation. The requirements for efficient open complex formation were similar to those for transcription in that both upstream elements and a basal element, either TATA or initiator, were necessary. The results further suggest that TATA-dependent and initiator-dependent preinitiation complex assembly pathways converge, prior to a step in which the strands are rapidly opened in the presence of ATP, to form analogous open complexes."

Acetic acid hydrolysis of the ketosidic linkages to lipid A in the lipopolysaccharide furnished a core oligosaccharide. Structural investigations were performed using 1H and 13C NMR, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of permethylated derivatives, and methylation linkage analysis on the core oligosaccharide and the products of two successive Smith degradations. It is concluded that the highly branched 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid-terminated oligosaccharide chains carried at the nonreducing end disaccharide units of beta-D-Qui3NAc-(1-->2)-beta-D-Qui3NAc (where Qui3NAc represents 3-acylamino-3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose), in which N-acyl residues were either both (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl or both 3-hydroxy-2,3-dimethyl-5-oxoprolyl.

https://openalex.org/W1538097477,"The DNA binding properties of human transcription factor PBP, which specifically binds to the proximal sequence element of mammalian U6 genes and which plays a pivotal role during their transcription, were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. As a prerequisite, we analyzed the optimal conditions for DNA binding of the PBP by assaying the stability of the interaction against increasing concentrations of salt, dithiothreitol, and heparin. The protein, which does not induce DNA bending, has a characteristic sensitivity against elevated temperatures and precipitously loses activity between 41 and 43 degrees C, a property which can be used for selective inactivation of the protein. Subjection of the PBP to limited proteinase K treatment showed that the protein consists of at least two functional domains, one of which is required for DNA binding. The PBP binds to the PSE with a much higher specific equilibrium constant (Ks = 1.33 x 10(11) M-1) than to nonspecific DNA (Kn = 1.18 x 10(5) M-1). The association and dissociation rates of PBP.PSE interactions were quantitatively determined by kinetic analyses. The pronounced lag phase during the initiation reaction of mammalian U6 transcription in vitro is probably correlated with the slow binding of the PBP to its target sequence. Once formed, however, the PBP.PSE complex is very stable and has a much lower dissociation (kd = 1.84 x 10(-5) s-1) than association rate constant (ka = 0.18 x 10(6) M-1 s-1). Collectively, the results demonstrate that the PSE binding protein stably associates with a high affinity to its cognate promoter sequence, and this process represents one of the primary events in the formation of the preinitiation complex on the U6 gene. Finally, we analyzed the effect of individual base pair mutations within mammalian U6 PSE sequences on the binding of the PBP."
https://openalex.org/W1547554455,"We demonstrated previously that a phencyclidine-displaceable quinacrine binding site exists at the lipid-protein interface of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (AcChR) (Valenzuela, C. F., Kerr, J. A., and Johnson, D. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8238-8244). In this manuscript, we assess (1) the transverse position of this site in the lipid bilayer by examining the ability of a series of paramagnetic n-doxyl stearates (n-SALs) and iodide to quench receptor-bound quinacrine and membrane-partitioned octadecyl rhodamine B (C18-Rho) fluorescence and (2) the stoichiometry of histrionicotoxin- or phencyclidine-displaceable quinacrine binding. Initial experiments established what fraction of the n-doxyl stearates partitioned into the membranes and that the n-doxyl stearates do not interfere with quinacrine binding to the receptor at the concentrations used in the quenching studies. The n-doxyl stearate quenching experiments indicated relatively small ( or = 5-SAL > 12-SAL > 16-SAL. This contrasts with the n-doxyl stearate quenching of the membrane-partitioned C18-Rho which showed as much as an 8.6-fold difference between the various isomers with a rank order of quenching efficiencies of 5-SAL > 7-SAL > 12-SAL > or = 16-SAL. Iodide quenching measurements indicated significant solute accessibility to membrane-partitioned C18-Rho but not to receptor-bound quinacrine. The ratios of the bimolecular quenching rate constants for free to bound quinacrine and for free rhodamine B to membrane-partitioned C18-Rho were 53.4 and 6.6, respectively. Direct titration of quinacrine into suspensions of a high concentration of AcChR-associated membranes yielded an upper limit to the binding stoichiometry of 1.4 HTX- or PCP-displaceable quinacrine binding sites/AcChR functional units. The results suggest that there is a single phencyclidine- or histrionicotoxin-displaceable quinacrine binding site located at or somewhat below the level of the C5-C7 in the phospholipid acyl chains at the lipid-protein interface."
https://openalex.org/W1602197918,"Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the major envelope component of human hepatitis B virus, during infection drives the assembly and basolateral secretion from hepatocytes of both virions and subviral lipoprotein particles into the bloodstream. We studied the sorting behavior of HBsAg in the heterologous epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells permanently transformed with the hepatitis B virus S gene. These cells, forming tightly packed monolayers in permeable supports, secreted HBsAg apically through a mechanism not involving transcytosis. This suggests that molecular features acting as apical addressing information, seemingly unfunctional or less efficiently used by the exocytic machinery of hepatocytes, could be contained in short hydrophilic regions of HBsAg. Lipids also could play a role in this asymmetric sorting because HBsAg is known to be secreted by forming macromolecular lipoprotein complexes rather than as a soluble protein. Together with available data, our results would imply not only the existence of tissue-specific variations in handling constitutively secreted proteins but also that these variations are strikingly dependent on the kind of protein examined. On the other hand, pulse-chase experiments with tunicamycin showed that the expression of apical information in HBsAg particles does not require N-linked glycosylation, contrasting with the known gp80 Madin-Darby canine kidney-endogenous apical secretory marker. This is the first experimental evidence that carbohydrate moieties in secretory proteins do not hold domain-specific sorting signals, a fact previously shown exclusively for membrane proteins. Thus, HBsAg provides a novel model system for the analysis of the molecular mechanisms of constitutive apical secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1563333310,"Glycoinositol phospholipid (GPI) anchor structures derive from sequentially glycosylated inositol phospholipid precursors assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum. To characterize GPI biosynthesis in nontransformed human lymphocytes and to define the GPI synthetic defect underlying deficient expression of GPI-anchored proteins by paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) cells, putative intracellular GPI intermediates were analyzed following [3H]Man labeling of normal and affected lymphocytes. In unstimulated normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, [3H]Man incorporation into GPIs was minimally detectable but after phytohemagglutinin (PHA), allogeneic cell, or anti-CD3 stimulation, assembly of [3H]Man-labeled GPIs markedly increased. Expression of GPIs by prestimulated quiescent PHA blasts could be efficiently induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and increased by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 independently of new protein synthesis. Utilizing allogeneically stimulated cells in conjunction with PMA induction, products deriving from [3H]Man labeling of affected CD48- T and natural killer lymphocyte cell lines from five PNH patients were compared to those deriving from unaffected CD48+ cell lines from the same patients or controls. In contrast to unaffected paired control cells, affected cells of all of the patients exhibited a common abnormality in which they assembled dolichol-phosphoryl-Man but failed to express [3H]Man-containing GPIs. These data indicate that 1) significant GPI production in lymphocytes is dependent on prior stimulation of the cells, 2) exposure of lymphocytes to agents which activate protein kinase C induces GPI synthesis, and 3) in five PNH patients affected lymphocytes are uniformly defective in an early GPI biosynthetic step which undermines expression of GPI mannolipids."

Incorporation of [3H]thymidine is inhibited by 70-90% within 24 h after addition of 0.1 microM dexamethasone. This effect on L cells is completely reversible. The expression of the thymidine kinase gene (Tk-1) has been examined in L cells that have been treated with 0.1 microM dexamethasone for 24 h. Dexamethasone inhibits thymidine kinase activity 70-90% after 24 h. This is associated with a 90-95% decrease in Tk mRNA abundance. The decrease in Tk mRNA is not caused by a decrease in transcription of Tk-1, as shown by nuclear run-on transcription assays. Transient expression of the CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) gene, driven by the Tk-1 promoter, was not affected by dexamethasone, and transcription of stably integrated Tk minigenes in LMTk- cells was not affected by dexamethasone. This effect was observed regardless of whether Tk cDNA was fused to the simian virus 40 promoter or the mouse Tk-1 promoter region. Conversely, expression of thymidine kinase was inhibited when stable Tk+ transformants of LMTk- cells were exposed to glucocorticoids; and inhibition of expression was observed irrespective of the promoter that was used to drive transcription of the Tk minigenes. These data indicate that glucocorticoid regulation of Tk-1 in mouse L cells is, within the limits of detection of the assays used in these studies, entirely due to a posttranscriptional mechanism."

Chromatin structure of the second exon, the major body of the protein-encoding region, was highly sensitive to both DNase I and methidiumpropyl EDTA-Fe(II) in the active state but highly resistant to those agents in both temporarily and permanently inactive states, except that the fibroin amorphous region-encoding subregions remained relatively sensitive to DNase I. Distributions of DNase I hypersensitive sites in the 5' upstream region were generally similar between active and temporarily inactive states, but those of the permanently inactive state were markedly different. In the promoter-enhancer region, phosphodiester bonds between nucleotide positions -41 and -42 and also -42 and -43 were remarkably hypersensitive to DNase I in the active chromatin, but the same positions in the other two states were not."

The mechanism of SMHT formation involves enzymatic deacylation of Met-tRNA (k = 0.06 s-1) and, to a lesser extent, Met-AMP (k = 0.02 s-1). Cyclization of methionine, reminiscent of cyclization of homocysteine during editing, illustrates the limited ability of methionyl-tRNA synthetase to discriminate against the cognate methionine at the editing site designed for the noncognate homocysteine. In early stages of biotic evolution, SMHT, a sulfonium compound, may have fulfilled the present day methyl donor function of S-adenosylmethionine. Existing homologies between methionyl-tRNA synthetase and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase indicate evolutionary relatedness of the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1488441381,"In Lec35.1 CHO mutants, mannose-P-dolichol is synthesized but does not participate in the production of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor precursors or dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. We tested Lec35.1 cells for stable expression of a cDNA encoding GPI-anchored human folate-binding protein (FBP) with the eukaryotic expression vector pJB20. All normal transfectants, but no Lec35.1 transfectants, expressed FBP activity. However, rather than an inability to produce GPI anchors, lack of FBP expression in Lec35.1 was caused by gradual inactivation of the FBP cDNA. FBP cDNA became fully inactive after 2-3 months of culture, and FBP activity was not restored upon correction of the Lec35 mutation. Southern blot analysis revealed that inactivation was associated with gross rearrangement of FBP cDNA. The cellular FBP gene remained intact. Because the Lec35.1 cell line has the ability to inactivate transfected human FBP cDNA, caution should be exercised when expressing transfected cDNAs in Lec35.1 and similar GPI anchor/glycosylation mutants. Interestingly, these results suggest similarities between the Lec35.1 defect and the human disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which may involve gradual inactivation of a gene necessary for mannosylation of GPI anchor precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1539688758,"Glucosidase I initiates the processing of asparagine-linked glycoproteins by excising the distal alpha 1,2-linked glucosyl residue from the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide, soon after its en bloc transfer from the lipid-linked donor to the nascent polypeptide. 1-Deoxynojirimycin, an analog of D-glucose, is a potent competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. Sulfhydryl-seeking reagents also strongly inhibit the enzyme, implying the involvement of an -SH group in its activity. To test this hypothesis, glucosidase I was purified from the rat mammary gland and its active site was loaded with 1-deoxynojirimycin, to protect such a group(s), while -SH groups on the remaining surface of the enzyme were blocked with N-ethylmaleimide or para-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid. Deoxynojirimycin was removed by dialysis to expose the active site -SH group(s). This group(s) was then tagged with 3-(N-maleimidopropionyl)biocytin (MPB) and detected with 125I-streptavidin on Western blots. A series of experiments is presented to show that indeed a critical -SH group(s) is located within the catalytic site of the enzyme. Additionally, the enzyme also possesses one or more sulfhydryls and disulfide bonds in its primary structure. The experimental approach outlined here should apply to identify reactive sulfhydryl groups in other catalytically active proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1501968488,"A monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody that interacts with thromboxane A2 receptor was generated using an anti-idiotypic approach. Idiotypic antibodies against a potent receptor antagonist, HS-145, were generated in rabbit. The idiotypic antibodies were then selected by an affinity procedure using SQ29,548-Affi-Gel-102 matrix. The selected idiotypic antibodies were used as surrogate receptor for anti-idiotypic antibody generation. A mouse monoclonal antibody, 3D-9E-12, was generated. It was shown to displace 125I-HS-145 from affinity-purified idiotypic antibodies. It also inhibits 125I-IS-145 binding to thromboxane A2 receptor in human platelet membranes in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, it attenuated U46,619-induced increase in [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) binding and GTPase activity in human platelet membranes. Finally, it inhibited U46,619- but not PAF-induced platelet aggregation. These results indicate that 3D-9E-12 acts as a specific antagonist in the thromboxane A2 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1533566698,"The conditioned medium from the epidermal carcinoma cell line A431 is shown to inhibit the growth of three human myeloid leukemic cell lines. We have purified to homogeneity from this conditioned medium a 36-kDa protein, as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which inhibits [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA and induces cell surface expression of CD11b, the alpha chain of the adhesion receptor MAC-1, on the human promyelocytic leukemic cell line HL-60. This factor was purified by sequential anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and gel permeation chromatography. Amino acid sequence analysis of two tryptic fragments of the purified material showed greater than 95% homology with sequences 179-194 and 319-328 of the M chain of human L-lactate dehydrogenase. Although the tetrameric L-lactate dehydrogenase alone exhibits no activities associated with the purified 36-kDa protein, brief acid treatment which has been shown to yield predominantly monomeric lactate dehydrogenase-M1 results in about 50% of the maximal antiproliferative activity of that induced by this factor. The role of soluble factors of tumor origin in modulating myeloid function as part of an immunosurveillance network is discussed."
