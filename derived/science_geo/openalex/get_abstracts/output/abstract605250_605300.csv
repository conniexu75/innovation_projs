https://openalex.org/W2790701366,"The heterogeneity of exosomal populations has hindered our understanding of their biogenesis, molecular composition, biodistribution and functions. By employing asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4), we identified two exosome subpopulations (large exosome vesicles, Exo-L, 90–120 nm; small exosome vesicles, Exo-S, 60–80 nm) and discovered an abundant population of non-membranous nanoparticles termed ‘exomeres’ (~35 nm). Exomere proteomic profiling revealed an enrichment in metabolic enzymes and hypoxia, microtubule and coagulation proteins as well as specific pathways, such as glycolysis and mTOR signalling. Exo-S and Exo-L contained proteins involved in endosomal function and secretion pathways, and mitotic spindle and IL-2/STAT5 signalling pathways, respectively. Exo-S, Exo-L and exomeres each had unique N-glycosylation, protein, lipid, DNA and RNA profiles and biophysical properties. These three nanoparticle subsets demonstrated diverse organ biodistribution patterns, suggesting distinct biological functions. This study demonstrates that AF4 can serve as an improved analytical tool for isolating extracellular vesicles and addressing the complexities of heterogeneous nanoparticle subpopulations."

Genome-scale network reconstructions have helped uncover the molecular basis of metabolism. Here we present Recon3D, a computational resource that includes three-dimensional (3D) metabolite and protein structure data and enables integrated analyses of metabolic functions in humans. We use Recon3D to functionally characterize mutations associated with disease, and identify metabolic response signatures that are caused by exposure to certain drugs. Recon3D represents the most comprehensive human metabolic network model to date, accounting for 3,288 open reading frames (representing 17% of functionally annotated human genes), 13,543 metabolic reactions involving 4,140 unique metabolites, and 12,890 protein structures. These data provide a unique resource for investigating molecular mechanisms of human metabolism. Recon3D is available at http://vmh.life ."

However, recovering stored data on a large-scale currently requires all the DNA in a pool to be sequenced, even if only a subset of the information needs to be extracted. Here, we encode and store 35 distinct files (over 200 MB of data), in more than 13 million DNA oligonucleotides, and show that we can recover each file individually and with no errors, using a random access approach. We design and validate a large library of primers that enable individual recovery of all files stored within the DNA. We also develop an algorithm that greatly reduces the sequencing read coverage required for error-free decoding by maximizing information from all sequence reads. These advances demonstrate a viable, large-scale system for DNA data storage and retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W2788733333,"Genomic analyses of cancer have identified recurrent point mutations in the RNA splicing factor-encoding genes SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2 that confer an alteration of function. Cancer cells bearing these mutations are preferentially dependent on wild-type (WT) spliceosome function, but clinically relevant means to therapeutically target the spliceosome do not currently exist. Here we describe an orally available modulator of the SF3b complex, H3B-8800, which potently and preferentially kills spliceosome-mutant epithelial and hematologic tumor cells. These killing effects of H3B-8800 are due to its direct interaction with the SF3b complex, as evidenced by loss of H3B-8800 activity in drug-resistant cells bearing mutations in genes encoding SF3b components. Although H3B-8800 modulates WT and mutant spliceosome activity, the preferential killing of spliceosome-mutant cells is due to retention of short, GC-rich introns, which are enriched for genes encoding spliceosome components. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of splicing modulation in spliceosome-mutant cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2785429866,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic form of intellectual disability in males, is caused by silencing of the FMR1 gene associated with hypermethylation of the CGG expansion mutation in the 5′ UTR of FMR1 in FXS patients. Here, we applied recently developed DNA methylation editing tools to reverse this hypermethylation event. Targeted demethylation of the CGG expansion by dCas9-Tet1/single guide RNA (sgRNA) switched the heterochromatin status of the upstream FMR1 promoter to an active chromatin state, restoring a persistent expression of FMR1 in FXS iPSCs. Neurons derived from methylation-edited FXS iPSCs rescued the electrophysiological abnormalities and restored a wild-type phenotype upon the mutant neurons. FMR1 expression in edited neurons was maintained in vivo after engrafting into the mouse brain. Finally, demethylation of the CGG repeats in post-mitotic FXS neurons also reactivated FMR1. Our data establish that demethylation of the CGG expansion is sufficient for FMR1 reactivation, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for FXS."

The genomic origins, sequences, and lengths of animal piRNAs vary, but some of the biological functions of piRISCs appear to be shared. For example, piRISCs are required for fertility and transposon silencing in worms, flies, and mice (Aravin et al., 2001Aravin A.A. Naumova N.M. Tulin A.V. Vagin V.V. Rozovsky Y.M. Gvozdev V.A.

The C. elegans Piwi protein, PRG-1, binds an abundant class of germline-expressed 21-nucleotide (nt) piRNAs with a 5′ uridine (21U-RNAs)(Batista et al., 2008Batista P.J. Ruby J.G. Claycomb J.M.

Targeting by the 21U-RNA/PRG-1 piRISC complex recruits an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that initiates the de novo synthesis of secondary 22-nt small RNAs that are templated directly from the target RNA and exhibit a bias for a 5′ guanosine residue. These so-called 22G-RNAs engage an expanded group of worm Argonautes (WAGOs) that function downstream of piRNAs to silence transposons and many endogenous genes. The WAGO pathway is required for long-term maintenance of silencing (Bagijn et al., 2012Bagijn M.P. Goldstein L.D. Sapetschnig A. Weick E.M. Bouasker S. Lehrbach N.J. Simard M.J. Miska E.A.

Conte Jr., D. Mello C.C. C. elegans piRNAs mediate the genome-wide surveillance of germline transcripts.Cell. 2012; 150: 78-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). piRNA targeting in C. elegans permits mismatches, suggesting that thousands of endogenous mRNAs could be targeted by piRNAs (Lee et al., 2012Lee H.C. Gu W. Shirayama M. Youngman E. Conte Jr., D. Mello C.C. C. elegans piRNAs mediate the genome-wide surveillance of germline transcripts.Cell. 2012; 150: 78-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, anti-silencing mechanisms are thought to prevent or reduce the sensitivity of endogenous mRNAs to piRNA-mediated silencing. The CSR-1 pathway, for example, is thought to be one arm of a “self” recognition pathway that protects endogenous mRNAs from piRNA surveillance (Seth et al., 2013Seth M. Shirayama M. Gu W. Ishidate T. Conte Jr., D. Mello C.C. The C. elegans CSR-1 argonaute pathway counteracts epigenetic silencing to promote germline gene expression.Dev. Cell. 2013; 27: 656-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CSR-1 engages RdRP-derived small RNAs templated from nearly all germline-expressed mRNAs (Claycomb et al., 2009Claycomb J.M. Batista P.J. Pang K.M. Gu W. Vasale J.J. van Wolfswinkel J.C. Chaves D.A. Shirayama M. Mitani S.

However, it is unknown whether CSR-1 blocks PRG-1 targeting directly or if it acts downstream to prevent WAGO recruitment. The identification of piRNA targets is essential for deciphering the roles of piRNAs in both sequence-directed immunity and more broadly in the regulation of germline gene expression. Here, we optimize a crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) protocol to identify piRNAs and associated (candidate) target RNA binding sites in C. elegans (Helwak et al., 2013Helwak A. Kudla G. Dudnakova T. Tollervey D.

Biol. 2014; 1093: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We identified 200,000 high-confidence piRNA-target site interactions. The overwhelming majority of interactions were between piRNAs and mRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis of the hybrids revealed that targets are enriched for energetically favorable Watson-Crick pairing with their associated piRNAs. We show that the seed sequence (i.e., positions 2 to 8) and supplemental nucleotides near the 3′ end (positions 14 to 19) of the piRNA are important determinants of piRNA-target binding and silencing, suggesting that piRNA targeting resembles miRNA targeting. piRNA target sites defined by CLASH show a non-random pattern of WAGO 22G-RNAs that initiate at both ends and near the center (position 12) of the piRNA target site, consistent with local recruitment of RdRP. Analysis of CLASH hybrids obtained from CSR-1-depleted animals suggest that CSR-1 protects its targets from PRG-1 binding and WAGO-dependent silencing. Our findings reveal that the entire germline mRNA transcriptome engages piRISC, and suggests how germline Argonaute pathways are coordinated to achieve comprehensive regulation and surveillance of germline gene expression. We used a modified cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) approach to identify RNAs associated with the C. elegans PRG-1-piRISC complex. Briefly, CLASH involves the in vivo cross-linking of RNAs to a protein of interest followed by immunoprecipitation (IP), trimming of RNA ends, ligation to form hybrids between proximal RNAs within the crosslinked complex, cDNA preparation, library construction, and deep sequencing (see STAR Methods; Figures 1A–1E). In principle, this procedure should allow the recovery of hybrid-sequence reads formed when piRNAs are ligated to proximal cellular target RNAs within the cross-linked PRG-1 IP complex. To perform CLASH, we first used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to introduce a GFP-TEV-FLAG (GTF) multiplex tag into the endogenous prg-1 locus (Kim et al., 2014Kim H. Ishidate T. Ghanta K.S. Seth M. Conte Jr., D. Shirayama M. Mello C.C. A co-CRISPR strategy for efficient genome editing in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2014; 197: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition to direct fluorescence detection this tag also permits tandem affinity purification with a TEV protease-mediated elution after the first affinity step. GTF::PRG-1 exhibited a robust expression and was prominently localized in P-granules (Figure S1A) in a pattern identical to that previously reported in PRG-1 immunolocalization studies (Batista et al., 2008Batista P.J. Ruby J.G. Claycomb J.M. Chiang R. Fahlgren N. Kasschau K.D. Chaves D.A. Gu W. Vasale J.J. Duan S. et al.PRG-1 and 21U-RNAs interact to form the piRNA complex required for fertility in C. elegans.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 67-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Moreover, the GTF::PRG-1 fusion protein was functional, as evidenced by its ability to mediate piRNA-dependent silencing of a gfp::cdk-1 reporter gene (Figure S1B). We then carefully optimized each step of the CLASH procedure using GTF-PRG-1 (Figures 1A–1E; STAR Methods) (Broughton et al., 2016Broughton J.P. Lovci M.T. Huang J.L. Yeo G.W. Pasquinelli A.E. Pairing beyond the Seed Supports MicroRNA Targeting Specificity.Mol. Cell. 2016; 64: 320-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, Helwak et al., 2013Helwak A. Kudla G. Dudnakova T. Tollervey D. Mapping the human miRNA interactome by CLASH reveals frequent noncanonical binding.Cell. 2013; 153: 654-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The tandem affinity purification of GTF::PRG-1 resulted in recovery of a single prominent protein of the expected size in silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Figure 1B). Although GTF::PRG-1 stably associated with piRNAs under these purification conditions, the recovery of longer associated RNA required the pretreatment of the worms with ultraviolet light. These crosslinked RNA Protein complexes, RNPs, were then treated with nuclease to trim the long RNAs, followed by intermolecular ligation to form RNA hybrids between the piRNA and target (Figures 1B–1D). RNA hybrids of approximately 42 nts were recovered by gel purification (Figure 1E) and were used for library construction and deep-sequencing. In two independent experiments, we found similar distributions of mapped sequence reads (Figures S1C–S1H). Together, these comprised a total of ∼21million reads, including a total of ∼7-million reads corresponding to 17,192 different piRNAs. Most of these piRNA-containing reads lacked a hybrid sequence (1,083,172), or the hybrid sequences could not be mapped to the genome because they were too short, or for other reasons (3,946,162). We obtained 2,106,813 hybrid reads composed of a piRNA sequence and a genome-mapping sequence, of which ∼1.5 million were composed of a single piRNA sequence fused to an mRNA. In addition to mRNA chimeras, we detected piRNAs fused to sequences corresponding to rRNA (137,322 reads), tRNA (11,231 reads), pseudogenes (48,208 reads), lincRNA (2,583 reads), miRNA (1,556 reads), introns (10,529 reads), and transposable elements (19,092 reads). Because mRNA chimeras were by far the most abundant type of hybrid read, we chose to focus on mRNA hybrids in the present study. Altogether a total of 16,385 genes were represented among the piRNA hybrids (Figure 1F). We found that “soma-specific” mRNAs were strongly under-represented in the CLASH data (Figure 1G) (Beanan and Strome, 1992Beanan M.J. Strome S. Characterization of a germ-line proliferation mutation in C. elegans.Development. 1992; 116: 755-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Li et al., 2014Li J.J. Huang H. Bickel P.J. Brenner S.E. Comparison of D. melanogaster and C. elegans developmental stages, tissues, and cells by modENCODE RNA-seq data.Genome Res. 2014; 24: 1086-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that CLASH captures interactions between piRNAs and mRNAs that occur in the germline, and not interactions that occur in lysates. The frequency of recovery of each piRNA by CLASH correlated with its level in the input sample as measured by small RNA sequencing (Figure S1I, r = 0.58, p < 0.005). The nuclease treatment during the CLASH procedure was optimized to produce chimeras of approximately 40 nucleotides. Thus, each chimera potentially reflects a piRNA/target mRNA duplex ligated at, or near, one end of the duplex. We noted, however, that not all chimeras contained a full-length piRNA and that the recovered target regions varied in length, indicating some variability in nuclease trimming during the CLASH procedure. Therefore, prior to searching for base-pairing interactions, we inferred the full-length piRNA and extended the empirically defined target space by adding nucleotides to each end, creating “ideal” piRNA/target RNA pairs (see STAR Methods). We next predicted the most energetically favorable piRNA-mRNA interactions from in silico folding of these “ideal” sequences and compared it with predicted binding energies in a control dataset with randomly matched pairs (Figure 1H). This analysis showed that stable base-pair interactions were strongly enriched in the recovered piRNA-mRNAs chimeras. In fact, when normalized for mRNA levels, hybrid read counts per target site correlated better with binding energy than with piRNA abundance (see Discussion) (Figure 1I). Chimeras in which the piRNA 3′ end was contiguous with mRNA sequence were roughly 20-fold more frequent than chimeras ligated at piRNA 5′ ends (Figure S1J). These findings are consistent with the idea that piRNA 3′ ends are more available for ligation to their targets. Taken together, these findings support the idea that CLASH captures proximal mRNAs bound to piRISC via base-pairing interactions. In C. elegans, piRISC recruits RdRP to its targets. Therefore, we wished to examine the pattern of RdRP-dependent 22G-RNA production near CLASH-defined piRNA target sites in both WT and prg-1 mutant worms. To do this, we plotted 22G-RNA levels within a 40-nt region centered on the piRNA complementary sequences defined by CLASH. The 5′ ends of 22G-RNAs are thought to be formed directly from RdRP initiating at C residues within the target mRNAs. We therefore normalized the 22G-RNA levels initiating at each position to the frequency of C residues within the CLASH-defined targets at each position. Because the CSR-1, and WAGO Argonaute pathway are thought to have opposing functions, resisting and supporting piRNA silencing (Seth et al., 2013Seth M. Shirayama M. Gu W. Ishidate T. Conte Jr., D.

Batista P.J. Pang K.M. Gu W. Vasale J.J. van Wolfswinkel J.C. Chaves D.A. Shirayama M. Mitani S.

Cell. 2009; 36: 231-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). As a control set, we considered a target region arbitrarily set 100 nts away (within each mRNA) from of the piRNA binding sites identified by CLASH. In WT animals, 22G-RNA levels were much higher for WAGO targets than for CSR-1 targets, as expected (Figures 2A and 2B , Figures S2A and S2B). However, piRNA binding sites within both WAGO and CSR-1 targets showed a non-random distribution of 22G-RNA levels across the interval. By contrast, the control regions within the same target mRNAs, but offset from the hybrid sites, exhibited no such patterns (Figures 2G and 2H). WAGO targets exhibited a strong central peak, and clusters of peaks at either end of the piRNA target sites. To describe these patterns, we refer to the mRNA sequences near the target site as follows: t1 through t30 includes the presumptive binding site (t1 to t21) plus 9 nucleotides 5′ of the target site (t22 to t30). The mRNA region 3′ of the target site consists of nucleotides t–1 through t–11. Strikingly, this analysis revealed a prominent peak in the center of the piRNA complementary region near t12, and smaller peaks centered at t1 and t21 (Figure 2A). CSR-1 targets exhibited a cluster of much smaller peaks near the 3′ end of the predicted target site, with the largest peak residing in sequences located near t–5 (Figure 2B). The amplitudes of 22G-RNA levels on both the WAGO and CSR-1 targets correlated positively with the predicted free energy of piRNA binding and to a lesser extent with piRNA abundance (Figures 2C–2F and S2C–2F).Figure S222G-RNAs Signal in the piRNA Binding Region, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–F) 22G-RNAs peak at the center and ends of piRNA binding sites in another dataset, similar to Figure 2.(G and H) Distribution of 22G-RNA signal in input versus WAGO-1 IP for WAGO targets (G), and for CSR-1 targets (H).(I and J) Distribution of 22G-RNA signal in input versus WAGO-9 IP for WAGO targets (I), and for CSR-1 targets (J).(K and L) Distribution of 22G-RNA signal in input versus CSR-1 IP for CSR-1 targets (K), and for WAGO targets (L).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A–F) 22G-RNAs peak at the center and ends of piRNA binding sites in another dataset, similar to Figure 2.

For WAGO targets, the central peak at t12 was completely depleted in prg-1 mutants, whereas the terminal peaks were reduced. In CSR-1 targets, the prominent peak located at t–5 disappeared, but new peaks at t1, t6, and t21 became evident (Figure 2F). This analysis suggests that PRG-1 influences both the precise position, and the levels of 22G-RNAs on its targets, and that CSR-1 and WAGO targets differ strikingly in their accumulation of 22G-RNAs in response to piRNA targeting (see Discussion). Previous studies have revealed features of Argonaute/small RNA guided targeting, including the importance of “seed” pairing between the target and nucleotides 2 to 8 of the small RNA guide (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15907) Google Scholar). To explore patterns of piRNA-mediated targeting we used two independent computational strategies. In the first strategy, we considered the in silico predicted folding within a high-confidence group of “ideal” piRNA/target RNA pairs that were identified by at least 5 sequence reads in our combined datasets. To identify preferred base-pairing patterns within this group of hybrids, we applied the Affinity Propagation clustering algorithm (APcluster) (Frey and Dueck, 2007Frey B.J. Dueck D. Clustering by passing messages between data points.Science. 2007; 315: 972-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (5157) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed a clearly preferred interaction at the seed region and distinct base-pairing patterns at the 3′ supplementary region (Figures 3A and 3B , and Figure S3A). Notably, base-pairing frequencies declined from positions 9 to 13 of the piRNA and increased from positions 14 to 19 (Figure S3B). As expected, these patterns were not enriched in a set of randomized piRNA target RNA pairs (Figure 3A, and Figure S3A).Figure S3Features of piRNA and Target Interactions, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Positions of base-paired nucleotides in piRNAs for all piRNA:mRNA interactions. piRNA:targets duplex structure predictions were calculated using RNAfold, and clustered using APcluster.

Here, we describe a Treg subpopulation that controls hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence and engraftment. These Tregs highly expressed an HSC marker, CD150, and localized within the HSC niche in the bone marrow (BM). Specific reduction of BM Tregs achieved by conditional deletion of CXCR4 in Tregs increased HSC numbers in the BM. Adenosine generated via the CD39 cell surface ectoenzyme on niche Tregs protected HSCs from oxidative stress and maintained HSC quiescence. In transplantation settings, niche Tregs prevented allogeneic (allo-) HSC rejection through adenosine and facilitated allo-HSC engraftment. Furthermore, transfer of niche Tregs promoted allo-HSC engraftment to a much greater extent than transfer of other Tregs. These results identify a unique niche-associated Treg subset and adenosine as regulators of HSC quiescence, abundance, and engraftment, further highlighting their therapeutic utility."

For the others, additional support (n = 9) or pleiotropic effects (n = 2) were found in the literature, but the results reported here were further refined. All 15 replicated loci highlighted distinctive patterns of global-to-local genetic effects on facial shape and showed enrichment for active chromatin elements in human cranial neural crest cells, suggesting an early developmental origin of the facial variation captured. These results have implications for studies of facial genetics and other complex morphological traits."

https://openalex.org/W2766545389,"The fate and function of epigenetic marks during the germline-to-embryo transition is a key issue in developmental biology, with relevance to stem cell programming and transgenerational inheritance. In zebrafish, DNA methylation patterns are programmed in transcriptionally quiescent cleavage embryos; paternally inherited patterns are maintained, whereas maternal patterns are reprogrammed to match the paternal. Here, we provide the mechanism by demonstrating that ""Placeholder"" nucleosomes, containing histone H2A variant H2A.Z(FV) and H3K4me1, virtually occupy all regions lacking DNA methylation in both sperm and cleavage embryos and reside at promoters encoding housekeeping and early embryonic transcription factors. Upon genome-wide transcriptional onset, genes with Placeholder become either active (H3K4me3) or silent (H3K4me3/K27me3). Notably, perturbations causing Placeholder loss confer DNA methylation accumulation, whereas acquisition/expansion of Placeholder confers DNA hypomethylation and improper gene activation. Thus, during transcriptionally quiescent gametic and embryonic stages, an H2A.Z(FV)/H3K4me1-containing Placeholder nucleosome deters DNA methylation, poising parental genes for either gene-specific activation or facultative repression."

This transfer learning mechanism might provide new insights into other covert processes like mental rehearsal. Understanding motor-related covert mental processes, such as imagined or intended movements, and mental rehearsal is tantalizing as these internal behaviors have been shown to exhibit varying degrees of motor learning transfer (Denis, 1985Denis M. Visual imagery and the use of mental practice in the development of motor skills.Can. J. Appl. Sport Sci. 1985; 10: 4S-16SPubMed Google Scholar, Papaxanthis et al., 2002Papaxanthis C. Schieppati M.

Decades of human behavioral studies have shown that mental rehearsal can improve motor skills such as throwing darts or making free throws (Feltz and Landers, 1983Feltz D.L. Landers D.M. The effects of mental practice on motor skill learning and performance: A meta-analysis.J. Sports Psychol. 1983; 5: 25-57Crossref Google Scholar), and mental rehearsal has also been shown to sometimes aid in rehabilitation (Warner and McNeill, 1988Warner L. McNeill M.E.

EEG Neurosci. 2011; 42: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Working theories posit that motor learning transfer is a result of covert learning engaging neural population activity similar to that employed during overt practice. In support of this, “mirror neurons” in ventral premotor cortex have been shown to discharge both when actions are overtly performed and when they are observed (Rizzolatti et al., 2001Rizzolatti G. Fogassi L. Gallese V. Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the understanding and imitation of action.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). These results, however, are still debated (Hickok, 2009Hickok G. Eight problems for the mirror neuron theory of action understanding in monkeys and humans.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2009; 21: 1229-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and do not propose mechanistic hypotheses about why neural similarity is helpful for learning transfer. This debate stems primarily from the fact that mental rehearsal, and covert processes in general, are difficult to define and even more challenging to experimentally study. They are open-loop hidden processes, where experimenters cannot directly observe the internal process or the trial-by-trial progression of learning. In this study, we present a covert process that enables a direct and real-time probe into this evolution, by “closing the loop.” We use a brain-machine interface (BMI), which takes as input neural activity from dorsal premotor and primary motor cortex. This neural activity is mapped through a fixed mathematical function, i.e., “decoder,” to produce a two-dimensional cursor movement. This defines a closed-loop system by which subjects receive visual feedback of the on-screen cursor, and the experimenters observe both the behavior and the evolving neural activity on a trial-by-trial basis. The BMI context elicits internal motor processes that share an end-goal with overt processes because subjects use the decoder (i.e., neural activity without overt movements) to make the same cursor movements as they will perform subsequently using arm movements. We constructed the decoder by associating the kinematics of automated cursor movements with neural activity recorded while subjects observed these movements (Gilja et al., 2012Gilja V. Nuyujukian P. Chestek C.A. Cunningham J.P. Yu B.M. Fan J.M. Churchland M.M. Kaufman M.T. Kao J.C. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. A high-performance neural prosthesis enabled by control algorithm design.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1752-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This was done in contrast to using neural activity measured during overt movements. Previous findings have shown that neural signals involved in watching cursor movements are engaged in mental rehearsal and involve many of the same cells as when generating movement (Cisek and Kalaska, 2004Cisek P. Kalaska J.F. Neural correlates of mental rehearsal in dorsal premotor cortex.Nature. 2004; 431: 993-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The BMI paradigm is a powerful tool for studying learning because the decoder establishes a causal link between behavior (i.e., cursor movements), and all the neurons directly responsible for producing that behavior. Thus, the only way to modify the behavior is to causally modify the input neurons to the decoder. Several groups have used BMIs to dissect a variety of sensorimotor and learning processes (recent germane studies include Jarosiewicz et al., 2008Jarosiewicz B. Chase S.M. Fraser G.W. Velliste M.

Here, we use BMIs to establish a “covert rehearsal” paradigm whereby subjects can “practice” or in a sense “rehearse” a motor task directly using their neural activity without movement (i.e., covertly). We can then evaluate the degree of learning transfer by having the subjects repeat the same task using overt movements. In this non-human primate study, we cannot definitively equate covert rehearsal to imagined movements or mental rehearsal (though this may well be what the monkeys are doing). Critically, covert rehearsal differs from mental rehearsal in that it provides the monkeys with real-time visual feedback of the on-screen cursor. This design, however, is intentional as it provides a first-ever direct probe into studying the single-trial neural (and behavioral) correlates of covert learning. Thus, the goal of this study is to use the covert rehearsal paradigm to evaluate two key scientific questions underlying most covert processes: (1) can covert processes (which covert rehearsal is a type of) facilitate overt motor learning, and (2) if so, what neural mechanism mediates this transfer? If covert processes can facilitate overt learning, we expect to observe that neural changes resulting from learning in one context would result in behavioral changes in the other. This would suggest that covert learning does transfer, and the corresponding neural activity would provide a glimpse at its mechanism. We note, however, that in this study learning is measured through the lens of motor adaptation; monkeys learn to adapt to a visuomotor rotation. Adaptation is used here, as is commonly done in the literature, as one simple subset of motor learning (Jarosiewicz et al., 2008Jarosiewicz B. Chase S.M. Fraser G.W. Velliste M. Kass R.E.

Somatosensory cortex plays an essential role in forelimb motor adaptation in mice.Neuron. 2017; 93: 1493-1503.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, a conservative interpretation of our claims concerning motor learning and its transfer, including any relation to mental rehearsal, should be restricted to the transfer of adaptation. Nonetheless, recent evidence (e.g., Churchland et al., 2012Churchland M.M. Cunningham J.P. Kaufman M.T. Foster J.D. Nuyujukian P. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Neural population dynamics during reaching.Nature. 2012; 487: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) suggests that the dynamical systems-based mechanism that we describe in this study could generally be at work for other more complex motor behaviors. The present experiments thus set the stage for future studies of motor learning transfer in skilled motor tasks. In the present study, we provide key evidence that covert learning does indeed transfer to overt performance. Concomitantly, we propose a dynamical systems mechanism for motor learning transfer. In particular, our analyses will reveal that overt and covert movements derive from a common neural substrate, which consists of motor preparatory activity. Our analyses will also reveal that learning is consistent with manipulating this preparatory activity, and the common substrate enables persistence of these changes, hence facilitating learning transfer. Furthermore, we find that this substrate is also common to neural activity recorded during contexts previously shown to be engaged in mental rehearsal. While this does not prove that our covert rehearsal paradigm is the same as mental rehearsal, the neural and behavioral results suggest that our proposed neural mechanism could generally be at work in other covert processes. We will also argue that our covert rehearsal paradigm can serve as a valuable tool for motor learning (and potentially rehabilitation) in and of itself. Lastly, our results add to a growing body of evidence that suggest a dynamical systems interpretation of motor cortex (Gallego et al., 2017Gallego J.A. Perich M.G. Miller L.E. Solla S.A. Neural manifolds for the control of movement.Neuron. 2017; 94: 978-984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), where in particular, we now argue for a more fundamental role of motor preparation in learning. Two monkeys were trained to move a computer cursor from the center of a virtual reality workspace to one of eight radially arranged targets. Monkeys performed this task either overtly using arm movements or covertly using a BMI (Figure 1A; Figure S1). The task appeared visually similar in both contexts as the virtual reality setup occluded the monkey’s view of his reaching arm. To directly test whether covert rehearsal can affect overt performance, we used the degree of transfer of motor adaptation to visuomotor rotations (VMRs) as an assay to study the relationship between covert and overt movements (Krakauer et al., 2000Krakauer J.W.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8916-8924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tanaka et al., 2009Tanaka H. Sejnowski T.J. Krakauer J.W.

Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We first measured VMR adaptation behavior in the overt context (i.e., “overt-to-overt transfer”) and then separately in the covert context (i.e., “covert-to-covert transfer”) to confirm that our experiments replicated expected VMR adaptation. We focus on VMR after-effects because this will subsequently be a key measure of across-context learning transfer. When VMRs were applied in the overt context, monkeys learned to move their arm at an angle (45°, 60°, or 90° relative to the non-rotated condition) in order for the cursor to directly reach the target (Figure 1B, task-flow). After adaptation, we removed the VMR and measured cursor movement errors (i.e., after-effects). We observed the well-known post-VMR adaptation after-effect: monkeys initially reached in the opposite direction of the VMR, took longer to reach the target, and had large angular errors with respect to the straight-line direction to the target (Figures S2A–S2D). For VMRs introduced during the covert context, monkeys had to modulate neural activity to generate velocity commands at an angle in order to move the cursor directly toward the target. In this context, we ensured that no physical movements were made by ensuring that the correlation between any measured movement and the cursor movement (i.e., the task) was negligible, i.e., ρ < ±0.1 (Figure S1). Results during this covert context were also consistent with VMR adaptation (Figures S2E–S2H). Thus, both overt and covert VMRs exhibit well-established motor adaptation after-effects. Next, we tested whether motor adaptation would transfer across contexts by applying a VMR in the covert context, and after adaptation, switching to the overt context without rotation (i.e., “covert-to-overt transfer”; Figure 1B, bottom, cyan). Previous studies have been inconclusive regarding VMR adaptations generalizing across contexts (Krakauer et al., 2000Krakauer J.W. Pine Z.M. Ghilardi M.F. Ghez C.

Neurophysiol. 2009; 102: 2921-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, we found that monkeys’ overt reaches initially erred in the opposite direction of the preceding covert context VMR (Figure 1C). The corresponding error angles (Figures 1D and 1E) were significantly larger than a control condition where arm reaches followed a no-VMR covert block (Figure 1B, bottom, orange). This indicates that VMR adaptation during the covert context did transfer to the overt context. While this behavioral effect was robust, its magnitude was smaller than VMR adaptation observed within the overt-to-overt context, both in terms of the error angle, and the rate of washout (Figures S3A and S3B). This suggests that while there was reliable transfer, it was not “complete” transfer. We found no significant relationship between the covert VMR angle and the magnitude of the subsequent transfer to the overt context as measured by initial error angle (Figure S3C). We did find that greater adaptation during the covert context led to longer washout both for subsequent covert and overt blocks (Figure 1F). Interestingly, this relationship was similar regardless of which context the learning occurred (covert and overt points lie along the same line). This raises the possibility that covert and overt adaptations could engage a similar neural process. Independent from degree of adaptation, we also found that decoders with higher absolute performance led to longer washouts (Figure S3C). This suggests that decoders more similar to the “manual decoder,” i.e., overt reaches, result in greater transfer of learning. Taken together, these findings suggest that covert rehearsal has strong effects on subsequent overt motor behavior (and vice versa, i.e., “overt-to-covert transfer”; Figures S2I–S2L). Having established that transfer occurs, we investigated the neural correlates of this behavior, in hopes of discovering a potential mechanism. We were motivated to examine preparatory neural activity because of a growing body of behavioral (Johnson et al., 2002Johnson S.H. Rotte M. Grafton S.T. Hinrichs H. Gazzaniga M.S. Heinze H.J.

Concretely, we asked whether adaptation transfer from the covert context was reflected in the overt context population-level motor preparatory activity. This activity is high dimensional, so we visualized it after dimensionality reduction (Cunningham and Yu, 2014Cunningham J.P. Yu B.M. Dimensionality reduction for large-scale neural recordings.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). We found a low-dimensional state-space capturing over 80% of the co-modulation in the baseline data (Figure 2B). We used this state-space to visualize the delay period activity of overt trials following the switch from a VMR adaptation covert block (Figure 1B cyan shows experimental condition, Figure 2A shows behavior, Figure 2C shows neural projections for one example target). A striking feature of these trials is that early after the switch, preparatory states are shifted toward the neural state corresponding to preparing to move toward the adjacent target (i.e., the “anti-VMR” target). In other words, the monkey’s motor plan is oriented in a direction that opposes the VMR from the previous block. We interpret this shift as evidence of residual adaptation reflected in the preparatory neural state. Quantifying the preparatory states without dimensionality reduction confirmed that immediately following the shift from the covert VMR block (Figure 1, cyan condition), these states were biased in the direction of preparing reaches to the anti-VMR target. Over the course of the washout, preparatory states gradually realigned with the baseline states corresponding to reaches to the cued target (Figures 2D and 2E). Consistent with these population results, we found that single neuron preferred directions (PDs) rotated during learning in the direction corresponding to the VMR. During the washout epochs, PDs reoriented back to baseline (Figure S3D). These results demonstrate that: (1) adaptation to the VMR systematically changes motor preparatory activity toward a pattern known to prepare movements angled away from the VMR. These changes enable the subjects to presumably adapt to the VMR, i.e., neural and behavioral changes are strongly correlated on a trial-by-trial basis (Figure 2E). (2) The preparatory changes persist after switching from covert to overt contexts. (3) This neural transfer effect washes out gradually rather than exhibiting a sudden “reset” of the motor circuit, despite visual and proprioceptive feedback (Shadmehr et al., 2010Shadmehr R. Smith M.A. Krakauer J.W. Error correction, sensory prediction, and adaptation in motor control.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 89-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) and the explicit context change of the experimenter removing the monkey’s arm restraint. Taken together with previous findings (Cisek and Kalaska, 2004Cisek P. Kalaska J.F.

Psychol. 2016; 12: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), our population analyses suggest that covert rehearsal may involve “practicing” the appropriate motor system preparatory state, whereby behavioral improvements due to learning are accompanied by corresponding changes to the motor plan. This evidence dovetails with recent work arguing that motor cortical preparatory activity functions as advantageous initial conditions for subsequent peri-movement neural dynamics that generate the desired movement (Churchland et al., 2006Churchland M.M.

We therefore hypothesized that VMR adaptation transfer was due to covert and overt contexts engaging a similar dynamical system, where in particular both contexts utilized similar initial conditions. To test this, we first projected baseline overt context preparatory activity into the baseline covert context preparatory activity neural state-space. We found that population covariance patterns explaining most of the preparatory activity was shared between the covert and overt contexts (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the neural states corresponding to preparing either covert or overt movements to each target were well aligned (Figure 3B). We quantified this for full-dimensional population activity and found that covert and overt neural states, when preparing movements to a given target, were significantly more similar to each other than to any other target (near-zero diagonal in Figure 3C). Finally, we also found that the degree to which the covert and overt states overlapped (on a session-by-session basis) significantly predicted the magnitude of learning transfer for that session, where greater overlap led to greater transfer (Figure 3D). Previous findings have demonstrated that monkeys watching cursor movements elicit neural activity consistent with mental rehearsal. Since we trained our decoders using this neural activity, we compared preparatory activity during this cursor-observation period to preparatory activity recoded during covert rehearsal and overt movements. We found that just as covert and overt movements shared preparatory states, observed movements also derive from that common subspace (Figure 3A, “watch” condition). These results suggest that at least at the preparatory level, overt behavior shares neural operation with both covert rehearsal and putative mental rehearsal. Together these findings suggest the following potential mechanism for VMR transfer. During covert movements in the presence of a VMR, the sensorimotor system gradually shifts the delay period initial conditions to align with the direction opposing the VMR. We suspect that these changes contribute to the observed VMR adaptation. When the behavioral context switches from covert to overt, two key properties are preserved: (1) the sensorimotor system uses the same neural subspace to prepare cursor movements, and (2) changes in which preparatory state is associated with which cued target persist across the context change. This persistence likely causes subsequent arm movements to be rotated in the direction opposing the VMR, i.e., learning transfer. As monkeys continue to make movements without any VMR, a similar adaptation process reorients the preparatory neural activity back to baseline. The corresponding arm kinematics return to normal once their preparatory initial conditions have reoriented. This mechanism makes two testable predictions: ("

Here, we show that under more physiological, osmoprotective conditions, for various Gram-positive bacteria, lysis is delayed or abolished, apparently because inhibition of class A penicillin-binding protein leads to a block in autolytic activity. Although these cells still then die by other mechanisms, exogenous lytic enzymes, such as lysozyme, can rescue viability by enabling the escape of cell wall-deficient “L-form” bacteria. This protective L-form conversion was also observed in macrophages and in an animal model, presumably due to the production of host lytic activities, including lysozyme. Our results demonstrate the potential for L-form switching in the host environment and highlight the unexpected effects of innate immune effectors, such as lysozyme, on antibiotic activity. Unlike previously described dormant persisters, L-forms can continue to proliferate in the presence of antibiotic."
https://openalex.org/W2789621216,"The social brain hypothesis posits that dedicated neural systems process social information. In support of this, neurophysiological data have shown that some brain regions are specialized for representing faces. It remains unknown, however, whether distinct anatomical substrates also represent more complex social variables, such as the hierarchical rank of individuals within a social group. Here we show that the primate amygdala encodes the hierarchical rank of individuals in the same neuronal ensembles that encode the rewards associated with nonsocial stimuli. By contrast, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices lack strong representations of hierarchical rank while still representing reward values. These results challenge the conventional view that dedicated neural systems process social information. Instead, information about hierarchical rank—which contributes to the assessment of the social value of individuals within a group—is linked in the amygdala to representations of rewards associated with nonsocial stimuli. New data reveal that the amygdala—a brain area specialized for emotion—also signals the hierarchical rank of peers in a social group. These neural signals likely mediate appropriate social and emotional behavior in many social settings."

https://openalex.org/W2791998488,"Methylation at the 5 position of cytosine in DNA (5meC) is a key epigenetic mark in eukaryotes. Once introduced, 5meC can be maintained through DNA replication by the activity of 'maintenance' DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Despite their ancient origin, DNA methylation pathways differ widely across animals, such that 5meC is either confined to transcribed genes or lost altogether in several lineages. We used comparative epigenomics to investigate the evolution of DNA methylation. Although the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans lacks DNA methylation, more basal nematodes retain cytosine DNA methylation, which is targeted to repeat loci. We found that DNA methylation coevolved with the DNA alkylation repair enzyme ALKB2 across eukaryotes. In addition, we found that DNMTs introduced the toxic lesion 3-methylcytosine into DNA both in vitro and in vivo. Alkylation damage is therefore intrinsically associated with DNMT activity, and this may promote the loss of DNA methylation in many species."

The MI-induced bidirectional interaction between progressive left ventricle (LV) remodeling and kidney dysfunction is known to advance cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). Whether resolvins limit MI-induced cardiorenal inflammation is unclear. Thus, to define the role of exogenous resolvin D (RvD)-1 in post-MI CRS, we subjected 8- to 12-wk-old male C57BL/6 mice to coronary artery ligation. RvD1 was injected 3 h after MI. MI mice with no treatment served as MI controls (d 1 and 5). Mice with no surgery served as naive controls. In the injected mice, RvD1 promoted neutrophil (CD11b+/Ly6G+) egress from the infarcted LV, compared with the MI control group at d 5, indicative of neutrophil clearance and thereby resolved inflammation. Further, RvD1-injected mice showed higher reparative macrophages (F4/80+/Ly6Clow/CD206+) in the infarcted LV than did MI control mice at d 5 after MI. RvD1 suppressed the miRNA storm at d 1 and limited the MI-induced edematous milieu in a remote area of the LV compared with the MI control at d 5 after MI. Also, RvD1 preserved the nephrin expression that was diffuse in the glomerular membrane at d 5 and 28 in MI controls, indicating renal injury. RvD1 attenuated MI-induced renal inflammation, decreasing neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the kidney compared with the MI control. In summary, RvD1 clears MI-induced inflammation by increasing resolving leukocytes and facilitates renoprotective mechanisms to limit CRS in acute and chronic heart failure.—Halade, G.V., Kain, V., Serhan, C.N.

New HIV test options are available, including mobile unit testing, one-minute testing, at home or self-testing and couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC). In the context of these newer options, the objective of this study was to explore whether and how preferences for specific characteristics of the tests acted as barriers to and/or facilitators of testing in general and consistent testing specifically among young Black MSM and transgender women aged 16 to 29. Methods We conducted 30 qualitative, semi-structured, in-depth interviews with young, Black, gay, bisexual or MSM and transgender women in the New York City metropolitan area to identify preferences for specific HIV tests and aspects of HIV testing options. Participants were primarily recruited from online and mobile sites, followed by community-based, face-to-face recruitment strategies to specifically reach younger participants. Thematic coding was utilized to analyze the qualitative data based on a grounded theoretical approach. Results We identified how past experiences, perceived test characteristics (e.g., accuracy, cost, etc.) and beliefs about the “fit” between the individual, and the test relate to preferred testing methods and consistent testing. Three major themes emerged as important to preferences for HIV testing methods: the perceived accuracy of the test method, venue characteristics, and lack of knowledge or experience with the newer testing options, including self-testing and CHTC. Conclusions These findings suggest that increasing awareness of and access to newer HIV testing options (e.g., free or reduced price on home or self-tests or CHTC available at all testing venues) is critical if these new options are to facilitate increased levels of consistent testing among young, Black MSM and transgender women. Addressing perceptions of test accuracy and supporting front line staff in creating welcoming and safe testing environments may be key intervention targets. Connecting young Black MSM and transgender women to the best test option, given preferences for specific characteristics, may support more and more consistent HIV testing."

New targeted therapies show preclinical promise in inhibiting the KRAS G12C variant. However, concerns exist regarding the effectiveness of such therapies in vivo given the possibilities of existing intratumor heterogeneity or de novo mutation leading to treatment resistance. We performed deep sequencing of 27 KRAS G12-positive lung tumors to determine the prevalence of other oncogenic mutations within KRAS or within commonly mutated downstream genes that could confer resistance at the time of treatment. We also passaged patient-derived xenografts to assess the potential for novel KRAS mutation to arise during subsequent tumor evolution. Furthermore, we estimate the de novo mutation rate in KRAS position 12 and in genes downstream of KRAS. Finally, we present an approach for estimation of the selection intensity for these point mutations that explains their high prevalence in tumors. We find no evidence of heterogeneity that may compromise KRAS G12C targeted therapy within sequenced lung tumors or passaged xenografts. We find that mutations that confer resistance are even less likely to occur downstream of KRAS than to occur within KRAS. Our approach predicts that BRAF V600E would provide the highest fitness advantage for de novo-resistant subclones. Overall, our findings suggest that resistance to targeted therapy of KRAS G12C-positive tumors is unlikely to be present at the time of treatment and, among the de novo mutations likely to confer resistance, mutations in BRAF, a gene with targeted inhibitors presently available, result in subclones with the highest fitness advantage."

The aim of the present study was to assess the genetic diversity of Podolian breeds and to reconstruct their origin. Methodology The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-regions of 18 Podolian breeds have been phylogenetically assessed. Nine non-Podolian breeds have been also included for comparison. Conclusion The overall analysis clearly highlights some peculiarities in the mtDNA gene pool of some Podolian breeds. In particular, a principal component analysis point to a genetic proximity between five breeds (Chianina, Marchigiana, Maremmana, Podolica Italiana and Romagnola) reared in Central Italy and the Turkish Grey. We here propose the suggestive hypothesis of a dual ancestral contribution to the present gene pool of Podolian breeds, one deriving from Eastern European cattle; the other arising from the arrival of Middle Eastern cattle into Central Italy through a different route, perhaps by sea, ferried by Etruscan boats. The historical migration of Podolian cattle from North Eastern Europe towards Italy has not cancelled the mtDNA footprints of this previous ancient migration."

Approximately 46% of older adults had had at least one fall during the previous two years (one fall 16% and recurrent falls 30%). Occasional falls were only associated with being a woman; in addition to the sex, recurrent falls were strongly associated with advanced age, rural residence, bad and very bad self-perception of health status, activity-limiting pain, urinary incontinence, depression, arthritis, limitations in basic activities of daily living, and limitations in advanced activities of daily living.

In this study, we (1) compared characteristics and diagnoses between CPs and NCPs who visited the ED in a cancer center or general hospital; (2) compared characteristics and diagnoses between CPs and NCPs who were hospitalized via the ED in a cancer center or general hospital; and (3) investigated important factors associated with such hospitalization. Methods and findings We analyzed patient characteristic and diagnosis [based on International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) codes] data from the ED of a comprehensive cancer center (MDACC), 24 general EDs in Harris County, Texas (HCED), and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 1/1/2007–12/31/2009. Approximately 3.4 million ED visits were analyzed: 47,245, 3,248,973, and 104,566 visits for MDACC, HCED, and NHAMCS, respectively, of which 44,143 (93.4%), 44,583 (1.4%), and 632 (0.6%) were CP visits. CPs were older than NCPs and stayed longer in EDs. Lung, gastrointestinal (excluding colorectal), and genitourinary (excluding prostate) cancers were the three most common diagnoses related to ED visits at general EDs. CPs visiting MDACC were more likely than CPs visiting HCED to be privately insured. CPs were more likely than NCPs to be hospitalized. Pneumonia and influenza, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and fever were important predictive factors for CP hospitalization; coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure were important factors for NCP hospitalization. Conclusions CPs consumed more ED resources than NCPs and had a higher hospitalization rate. Given the differences in characteristics and diagnoses between CPs and NCPs, ED physicians must pay special attention to CPs and be familiar with their unique set of oncologic emergencies."

Thus, targeting STAT3 promises to be an attractive strategy for the treatment of advanced metastatic tumors. Bisindolylmaleimide alkaloid (BMA) has been shown to have anti-cancer activities and was thought to suppress tumor cell growth by inhibiting protein kinase C. In this study, we show that a newly synthesized BMA analog, BMA097, is effective in suppressing tumor cell and xenograft growth and in inducing spontaneous apoptosis. We also provide evidence that BMA097 binds directly to the SH2 domain of STAT3 and inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation and activation, leading to reduced expression of STAT3 downstream target genes. Structure activity relationship analysis revealed that the hydroxymethyl group in the 2,5-dihydropyrrole-2,5-dione prohibits STAT3 inhibitory activity of BMA analogs. Altogether, we conclude that the synthetic BMA analogs may be developed as anti-cancer drugs by targeting and binding to the SH2 domain of STAT3 and inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway."

Our study explored client-provider communication about childbearing and safer conception among HIV clients in Uganda. Methods 400 Ugandan HIV clients in committed relationships and with intentions to conceive were surveyed. Knowledge, attitudes and practices related to childbearing, and use of safer conception methods were assessed, including communication with providers about childbearing needs, the correlates of which were examined with bivariate statistics and logistic multivariate analysis. Results 75% of the sample was female; 61% were on antiretroviral therapy; and 61% had HIV-negative or unknown status partners. Nearly all (98%) reported the desire to discuss childbearing intentions with their HIV provider; however, only 44% reported such discussions, the minority (28%) of which was initiated by the provider. Issues discussed with HIV providers included: HIV transmission risk to partner (30%), HIV transmission risk to child (30%), and how to prevent transmission to the child (27%); only 8% discussed safer conception methods. Regression analysis showed that those who had communicated with providers about childbearing were more likely to have been diagnosed with HIV for a longer period [OR (95% CI) = 1.09 (1.03, 1.15)], while greater internalized childbearing stigma was associated with lower odds of this communication [OR (95% CI) = 0.70 (0.49, 0.99)], after controlling for all bivariate correlates and basic demographics. Conclusions Communication between HIV clients and providers about childbearing needs is poor and associated with stigma. Innovations to mitigate stigma among clients as well as training to improve health worker communication and skills related to safer conception counseling is needed."

A total of 154 early adolescents (46% female; Mean age = 11.26; SD = .65) from diverse ethnic backgrounds provided self-reports of perspective taking, peer reports of acceptance by classmates, peer reports of prosocial behaviors, and saliva samples to assess basal cortisol. As expected and in alignment with previous research, afternoon cortisol, perspective taking, prosocial behaviors, and peer acceptance were all positively correlated. Path analyses followed by bootstrapping analyses revealed that the direct path from higher afternoon cortisol to higher levels of prosocial behavior was fully mediated by perspective taking skills. The direct path from higher afternoon cortisol to peer acceptance was fully mediated by perspective taking skills and prosocial behavior. The findings are discussed within the broader context of previous research on cortisol and social adjustment in childhood and early adolescence.

Transcription of the HOXA9 and HOXA10 genes is enhanced in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in these leukemias. We previously found the ARIH2 gene was repressed by HoxA9 in myeloid progenitors, but activated by HoxA10 during granulopoiesis. ARIH2 encodes the Triad1 protein, an anti-proliferative E3 ubiquitin ligase. In the current study, we investigate the role of Triad1 in leukemogenesis induced by an MLL1 fusion protein (Mll-Ell). We found Mll-Ell increased expression of HoxA9, HoxA10, and Triad1 because HoxA9 represses only one of two ARIH2 cis elements that are activated by HoxA10. Although Triad1 antagonized the generally pro-proliferative effects of the Mll-Ell oncoprotein, we found blocking HoxA9 and HoxA10 phosphorylation shifted the balance to ARIH2 repression in Mll-Ell+ cells. We investigated the significance of these in vitro results in a murine bone marrow transplant model. We found Triad1 knockdown significantly shortened the latency to development of AML in mice transplanted with Mll-Ell-transduced bone marrow. And, Triad1 expression fell during the prolonged AML latency period in mice transplanted with bone marrow expressing Mll-Ell alone. Our studies identify Triad1 as a leukemia suppressor in 11q23-AML.

Rapid events in desensitization include receptor phosphorylation and internalization, but mechanisms responsible for the decrease in receptor protein after prolonged agonist exposure (down-regulation) are ill defined. The microRNA (miRNA) let-7f regulates β2AR expression by translational repression. In cultured HASM cells from nonasthmatic and asthmatic lungs, 18 h of β-agonist exposure increased let-7f by 2–3-fold, concomitant with a ~90% decrease in β2ARs. Inhibition of let-7f attenuated this down-regulation response by ~50%. The let-7f increase was found to be cAMP/PKA-dependent. The mechanism of the let-7f increase was found by chromatin immunoprecipitation to be from activated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) binding to the let-7f promoter, thereby increasing let-7f expression. Knockdown of CREB attenuated agonist-promoted β2AR down-regulation by ~50%. Thus, β2AR down-regulation occurs as a result of not only internalized receptor degradation but also a novel cAMP/PKA/CREB-mediated increase in let-7f which causes enhanced repression of the β2AR gene, adrenoreceptor β2 (ADRB2) translation and represents ~50°% of the net loss of receptors observed after prolonged agonist exposure.

https://openalex.org/W2789965031,"Aim To characterise the genomic DNA (gDNA) yield from urine and quality of derived methylation data generated from the widely used Illuminia Infinium MethylationEPIC (HM850K) platform and compare this with buffy coat samples. Background DNA methylation is the most widely studied epigenetic mark and variations in DNA methylation profile have been implicated in diabetes which affects approximately 415 million people worldwide. Methods QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and QIAamp DNA micro kit were used to extract DNA from frozen and fresh urine samples as well as increasing volumes of fresh urine. Matched buffy coats to the frozen urine were also obtained and DNA was extracted from the buffy coats using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. Genomic DNA of greater concentration than 20μg/ml were used for methylation analysis using the HM850K array. Results Irrespective of extraction technique or the use of fresh versus frozen urine samples, limited genomic DNA was obtained using a starting sample volume of 5ml (0–0.86μg/mL). In order to optimize the yield, we increased starting volumes to 50ml fresh urine, which yielded only 0–9.66μg/mL A different kit, QIAamp DNA Micro Kit, was trialled in six fresh urine samples and ten frozen urine samples with inadequate DNA yields from 0–17.7μg/mL and 0–1.6μg/mL respectively. Sufficient genomic DNA was obtained from only 4 of the initial 41 frozen urine samples (10%) for DNA methylation profiling. In comparison, all four buffy coat samples (100%) provided sufficient genomic DNA. Conclusion High quality data can be obtained provided a sufficient yield of genomic DNA is isolated. Despite optimizing various extraction methodologies, the modest amount of genomic DNA derived from urine, may limit the generalisability of this approach for the identification of DNA methylation biomarkers of chronic diabetic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W2792311130,"The development of modern methods of species delimitation, unified under the ""integrated taxonomy"" approach, allows a critical examination and re-evaluation of complex taxonomic groups. The rose chafer Protaetia (Potosia) cuprea is a highly polymorphic species group with a large distribution range. Despite its overall commonness, its taxonomy is unclear and subject to conflicting hypotheses, most of which largely fail to account for its evolutionary history. Based on the sequences of two mitochondrial markers from 65 individuals collected across the species range, and a detailed analysis of morphological characters including a geometric morphometry approach, we infer the evolutionary history and phylogeography of the P. cuprea species complex. Our results demonstrate the existence of three separate lineages in the Western Palearctic region, presumably with a species status. However, these lineages are in conflict with current taxonomic concepts. None of the 29 analyzed morphological characters commonly used in the taxonomy of this group proved to be unambiguously species- or subspecies- specific. The geometric morphometry analysis reveals a large overlap in the shape of the analyzed structures (pronotum, meso-metaventral projection, elytra and aedeagus), failing to identify either the genetically detected clades or the classical species entities. Our results question the monophyly of P. cuprea in regard to P. cuprina, as well as the species status of P. metallica. On the other hand, we found support for the species status of the Sicilian P. hypocrita. Collectively, our findings provide a new and original insight into the taxonomy and phylogeny of the P. cuprea species complex. At the same time, the results represent the first attempt to elucidate the phylogeography of these polymorphic beetles."
https://openalex.org/W2790086488,"Prescription drug spending is growing faster than any other sector of healthcare. However, very little is known about patterns of prescribing and cost of prescribing between general practices. In this study, we examined variation in prescription rates and prescription costs through time for 55 GP surgeries in Northern Ireland Western Health and Social Care Trust. Temporal changes in variability of prescribing rates and costs were assessed using the Mann–Kendall test. Outlier practices contributing to between practice variation in prescribing rates were identified with the interquartile range outlier detection method. The relationship between rates and cost of prescribing was explored with Spearman's statistics. The differences in variability and mean number of prescribing rates associated with the practice setting and socioeconomic deprivation were tested using t-test and F-test respectively. The largest between-practice difference in prescribing rates was observed for Apr-Jun 2015, with the number of prescriptions ranging from 3.34 to 8.36 per patient. We showed that practices with outlier prescribing rates greatly contributed to between-practice variability. The largest difference in prescribing costs was reported for Apr-Jun 2014, with the prescription cost per patient ranging from £26.4 to £64.5. In addition, the temporal changes in variability of prescribing rates and costs were shown to undergo an upward trend. We demonstrated that practice setting and socio-economic deprivation accounted for some of the between-practice variation in prescribing. Rural practices had higher between practice variability than urban practices at all time points. Practices situated in more deprived areas had higher prescribing rates but lower variability than those located in less deprived areas. Further analysis is recommended to assess if variation in prescribing can be explained by demographic characteristics of patient population and practice features. Identification of other factors contributing to prescribing variability can help us better address potential inappropriateness of prescribing."

Methods The medical records of 614 men ≥40 years of age with LUTS and an International Prostate Symptom Score of ≥8 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had persistent storage symptoms after medical treatment for at least 6 months. A video-urodynamic study was done to investigate the underlying bladder or bladder outlet dysfunction. Predictors of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) by baseline urine flow metrics and prostate parameters were investigated. Results The final results revealed bladder neck dysfunction (BND) in 137/614 (22.3%), benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) in 246/614 (40.1%), detrusor overactivity (DO) in 193/614 (31.4%), and DO with detrusor underactivity (DO+DU) in 38/614 (6.2%) patients. Among the patients, 221/281 (78.6%) with a total prostatic volume (TPV) ≥40 ml had BOO, including 43/281 (15.3%) with BND and 178/281 (63.3%) with BPO. If we combined TPV ≥40 ml and Qmax <12 ml/s as predictors of BOO, BOO was found in 176/215 (81.8%) patients including 34/215 (15.8%) with BND and 142/215 (66.0%) with BPO. BOO was also found in 48.8% of men with a TPV <40ml, and in 36.3% of men with TPV< 40 ml and Qmax ≥ 12 ml/s. In 102 men with TPV <40 ml and Qmax ≥12 ml/s, 64 (62.7%) had DO. Conclusion BOO, including BND and BPO, comprise 62.4% (383/614) of men with persistent storage symptoms after initial medical treatment for LUTS/BPH. In men who have persistent storage symptoms after medical treatment for LUTS/BPH, BOO should be carefully investigated and appropriate management being given to improve LUTS."

https://openalex.org/W2788292918,"The HGMA1 architectural transcription factor is highly overexpressed in many human cancers. Because HMGA1 is a hub for regulation of many oncogenes, its overexpression in cancer plays a central role in cancer progression and therefore HMGA1 is gaining increasing attention as a target for development of therapeutic approaches to suppress either its expression or action in cancer cells. We have developed the strategy of introducing decoy hyper binding sites for HMGA1 into the nucleus of cancer cells with the goal of competetively sequestering overexpressed HMGA1 and thus suppressing its oncogenic action. Towards achieving this goal, we have introduced an HMGA1 decoy hyper binding site composed of six copies of a high affinity HMGA1 binding site into the genome of the replication defective adenovirus serotype 5 genome and shown that the engineered virus effectively reduces the viability of human pancreatic and cancer cells. Here we report the first pre-clinical measures of toxicity and biodistribution of the engineered virus in C57BL/6J Black 6 mice. The immune response to exposure of the engineered virus was determined by assaying the serum levels of key cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α. Toxicity due to exposure to the virus was determined by measuring the serum levels of the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Biodistribution was measured following direct injection into the pancreas or liver by quantifying viral loads in the pancreas, liver, spleen and brain."
https://openalex.org/W2791852246,"Background Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a leading cause of death in dengue. This study aims to identify predictors for GI bleeding in adult dengue patients, emphasizing the impact of existing comorbid disease(s). Methods Of 1300 adults with dengue virus infection, 175 (mean age, 56.5±13.7 years) patients with GI bleeding and 1,125 (mean age, 49.2±15.6 years) without GI bleeding (controls) were retrospectively analyzed. Results Among 175 patients with GI bleeding, dengue hemorrhagic fever was found in 119 (68%) patients; the median duration from onset dengue illness to GI bleeding was 5 days. Gastric ulcer, erythematous gastritis, duodenal ulcer, erosive gastritis, and hemorrhagic gastritis were found in 52.3%, 33.3%, 28.6%, 28.6%, and 14.3% of 42 patients with GI bleeding who had undergone endoscopic examination, respectively. Overall, nine of the 175 patients with GI bleeding died, giving an in-hospital mortality rate of 5.1%. Multivariate analysis showed age ≥60 years (cases vs. controls: 48% vs. 28.3%) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.663, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.128–2.453), end stage renal disease with additional comorbidities (cases vs. controls: 1.7% vs. 0.2%) (OR: 9.405, 95% CI: 1.4–63.198), previous stroke with additional comorbidities (cases vs. controls: 7.4% vs. 0.6%) (OR: 9.772, 95% CI: 3.302–28.918), gum bleeding (cases vs. controls: 27.4% vs. 11.5%) (OR: 1.732, 95% CI: 1.1–2.727), petechiae (cases vs. controls: 56.6% vs. 29.1%) (OR: 2.109, 95% CI: 1.411–3.153), and platelet count <50×109 cells/L (cases vs. controls: 53.1% vs. 25.8%) (OR: 3.419, 95% CI: 2.103–5.558) were independent predictors of GI bleeding in patients with dengue virus infection. Conclusions Our study is the first to disclose that end stage renal disease and previous stroke, with additional comorbidities, were strongly significant associated with the risk of GI bleeding in patients with dengue virus infection. Identification of these risk factors can be incorporated into the patient assessment and management protocol of dengue virus infection to reduce its mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2787716085,"Both Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones are overexpressed in cancer, making them relevant targets for the development of cancer chemotherapeutics, but a lack of biomolecular readouts for Hsp70 inhibition has limited the pursuit of specific inhibitors for this enzyme. A new study from Cesa et al. identifies two inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) as specific client substrates of Hsp70. These results establish biomarkers that can be utilized to monitor Hsp70 inhibition and provide a framework for future efforts to deconvolute chaperone networks."
https://openalex.org/W2791836317,"A better understanding of the normal and diseased biology of salivary glands (SG) has been hampered, in part, due to difficulties in cultivating and maintaining salivary epithelial cells. Towards this end, we have generated a mouse salivary gland epithelial cell (mSGc) culture system that is well-suited for the molecular characterization of SG cells and their differentiation program. We demonstrate that mSGc can be maintained for multiple passages without a loss of proliferation potential, readily form 3D-spheroids and importantly express a panel of well-established salivary gland epithelial cell markers. Moreover, mSGc 3D-spheroids also exhibit functional maturation as evident by robust agonist-induced intracellular calcium signaling. Finally, transcriptomic characterization of mSGc by RNA-seq and hierarchical clustering analysis with adult organ RNA-seq datasets reveal that mSGc retain most of the molecular attributes of adult mouse salivary gland. This well-characterized mouse salivary gland cell line will fill a critical void in the field by offering a valuable resource to examine various mechanistic aspects of mouse salivary gland biology."
https://openalex.org/W2790486925,"In birds, seasonal reproduction is regulated by day length, with long days in the spring activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and reproductive behaviors. The photoreceptors mediating this process remain unknown, but recently, the premammillary nucleus (PMM) of the hypothalamus has been implicated as the site of photoperiodic signaling in turkeys. We performed electrolytic lesions of the PMM to elucidate its role in the photoactivation and maintenance of egg production in female turkeys. Our results show that ablation of the PMM does not alter the normal lay cycle. No differences were found between lesioned birds and sham controls in the latency to lay following photostimulation, nor in subsequent egg production over a period of 29 weeks. No differences in the incidence of gonadal regression were found, indicating that the PMM is not essential for the termination of breeding. We conclude that any role of the PMM in photoperiodic regulation, if it exists, is redundant with other components of the system."
https://openalex.org/W2792663013,"External supervision of primary healthcare facilities in low- and middle-income countries often has a managerial main purpose in which the role of support for professional development is unclear.To explore how Rwandan primary healthcare supervisors and providers (supervisees) perceive evaluative and formative functions of external supervision.Qualitative, exploratory study.Focus group discussions: three with supervisors, three with providers, and one mixed (n = 31). Findings were discussed with individual and groups of supervisors and providers.Evaluative activities occupied providers' understanding of supervision, including checking, correcting, marking and performance-based financing. These were presented as sources of motivation, that in self-determination theory indicate introjected regulation. Supervisors preferred to highlight their role in formative supervision, which may mask their own and providers' uncontested accounts that systematic performance evaluations predominated supervisors' work. Providers strongly requested larger focus on formative and supportive functions, voiced as well by most supervisors. Impact of performance evaluation on motivation and professional development is discussed.While external supervisors intended to support providers' professional development, our findings indicate serious problems with this in a context of frequent evaluations and performance marking. Separating the role of supporter and evaluator does not appear as the simple solution. If external supervision is to improve health care services, it is essential that supervisors and health centre managers are competent to support providers in a way that transparently accounts for various performance pressures. This includes delivery of proper formative supervision with useful feedback, maintaining an effective supervisory relationship, as well as ensuring providers are aware of the purpose and content of evaluative and formative supervision functions."
https://openalex.org/W2793447762,"The primary objective of this study was to determine if activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis occurs in canine pleural effusions. Thirty-three dogs with pleural effusions of different origin were studied. Pleural effusion fibrinogen concentrations were significantly lower, while pleural fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) and D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher than those in plasma (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). These results show that, in canine pleural fluids, there is evidence of coagulation activation and fibrinolysis. The secondary aims of the current study were to determine if primary hyperfibrinolysis ([PHF] i.e., elevated plasma FDPs with a normal D-dimer concentrations), occurs in dogs with pleural effusion, and whether the presence of a concurrent inflammatory process may have activated the hemostatic cascade, with its intrinsically linked secondary hyperfibrinolysis, masking the concurrent PHF. The previously 33 selected dogs with pleural effusion (group 1) were compared to two control groups of 33 healthy (group 2) and 33 sick dogs without pleural effusion (group 3). Serum fibrinogen, FDPs, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen/CRP ratio, and frequency of PHF were determined. Fibrinogen, FDPs, D-dimer and CRP concentrations in group 1 were significantly increased compared to group 2 (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). FDPs and CRP concentrations in group 1 were also significantly increased compared to group 3 (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The fibrinogen/CRP ratio was significantly decreased in group 1 compared to groups 2 and 3 (P < 0.001 for both comparison). The frequency of PHF was significantly higher in group 1 compared to groups 2 (P = 0.004), but not compared to group 3. These results support the hypothesis that PHF occurs significantly more often in dogs with pleural effusion compared to healthy dogs. Nevertheless, the decrease in the fibrinogen/CRP ratio in group 1 compared to group 3, considering the higher FDPs and similar D-dimer concentrations, would suggest that PHF is also more frequent in dogs with pleural effusion compared to sick control dogs, and that this phenomenon is hidden due to concurrent secondary hyperfibrinolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2793896174,"Maternal genes present in mature oocytes play a crucial role in the early development of silkworm. Although maternal genes have been widely studied in many other species, there has been limited research in Bombyx mori. High-throughput next generation sequencing provides a practical method for gene discovery on a genome-wide level. Herein, a transcriptome study was used to identify maternal-related genes from silkworm eggs. Unfertilized eggs from five different stages of early development were used to detect the changing situation of gene expression. The expressed genes showed different patterns over time. Seventy-six maternal genes were annotated according to homology analysis with Drosophila melanogaster. More than half of the differentially expressed maternal genes fell into four expression patterns, while the expression patterns showed a downward trend over time. The functional annotation of these material genes was mainly related to transcription factor activity, growth factor activity, nucleic acid binding, RNA binding, ATP binding, and ion binding. Additionally, twenty-two gene clusters including maternal genes were identified from 18 scaffolds. Altogether, we plotted a profile for the maternal genes of Bombyx mori using a digital gene expression profiling method. This will provide the basis for maternal-specific signature research and improve the understanding of the early development of silkworm."
https://openalex.org/W2792196370,"Caloric restriction causes a homeostatic reduction in thermogenesis. We aimed to determine whether exercise could counteract this. We studied four groups of normal-weight ewes (n = 5), including control sedentary fed ad libitum, exercise fed ad libitum (30 min/d, 5 d/wk), diet-restricted (70% of ad libitum food intake), and combined diet and exercise. Temperature probes implanted in sternal and retroperitoneal adipose tissue and skeletal muscle measured thermogenesis. After the 4-wk intervention, hypothalami were collected for in situ hybridization, and fat and muscle biopsies were collected for real-time PCR and Western blotting. Combined diet and exercise reduced adiposity (P > 0.05). Caloric restriction alone reduced overnight temperatures in sternal and retroperitoneal fat (P > 0.05), which was counteracted by exercise (P > 0.05). Exercise did not induce expression of cellular markers of browning in adipose tissue. There was no effect of diet or exercise on skeletal muscle thermogenesis. Combined diet and exercise increased the expression of neuropeptide Y and agouti-related protein in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (P > 0.05), consistent with reduced adiposity. Gene expressions of key hypothalamic appetite-regulating peptides were not associated with altered thermogenesis.
