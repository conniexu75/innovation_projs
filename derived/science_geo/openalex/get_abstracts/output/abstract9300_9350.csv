https://openalex.org/W2049948139,"Rats learned, using distal room cues, to run to a goal on an elevated, circular track starting from any position on the track. The goal was one of eight equidistant, recessed cups set around the track, the goal cup being distinguished from the others solely by its position in the room. After learning, electrolytic lesions were made in the medial septal nucleus eliminating hippocampal theta rhythm in some animals but not in others. Rats without theta rhythm were no longer able to perform the spatial task, whereas rats with undisturbed theta rhythm retrained normal performance. Although rats without theta rhythm could not find their way directly to the goal, they recognized its location when they came upon it by chance. This type of spatial deficit appears similar to that shown by hippocampally lesioned patient H.M. Subsequent tests demonstrated that rats deprived of theta rhythm before training could nevertheless learn the task."
https://openalex.org/W1983408915,"As geologically relevant models of prebiotic environments, systems consisting of clay, water, and amino acids were subjected to cyclic variations in temperature and water content. Fluctuations of both variables produced longer oligopeptides in higher yields than were produced by temperature fluctuations alone. The results suggest that fluctuating environments provided a favorable geological setting in which the rate and extent of chemical evolution would have been determined by the number and frequency of cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2052665207,"Norepinephrine has a strongly lateralized distribution in the human thalamus. In the pulvinar region the left hemisphere is rich in norepinephrine, whereas in the somatosensory input area the right hemisphere has a higher concentration of this catecholamine. Such naturally occurring left-right differences in concentration of a neurotransmitter represent a new aspect of hemispheric specialization."
https://openalex.org/W2079403009,Samples of spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from the dorsal hippocampus of rabbits were recorded immediately before classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane response. Computer analysis revealed a significant predictive relationship between EEG frequency characteristics and the subsequent rate of learning.
https://openalex.org/W2044183185,"Studies of nitrate balance in humans and analyses of fecal and ileostomy samples indicate that nitrite and nitrate are formed de novo in the intestine, possibly by heterotrophic nitrification. These findings significantly alter our previous conceptions of human exposure to nitrite and suggest an even wider role for nitrite in the etiology of human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1979213859,Children with neoplastic diseases were offered an unusual ice cream before their drug treatments. Patients experiencing gastrointestinal toxicity due to the drugs were subsequently less likely to choose that ice cream again than controls. This suggests that taste aversions induced by drug-associated symptoms may contribute to the appetite loss experienced by cancer patients.
https://openalex.org/W2034230809,"In rats after portacaval anastomosis (an animal model of chronic liver disease), transport of tryptophan and other members of the large neutral amino acid group from blood to brain was markedly enhanced. Increased transport activity was apparently restricted to the neutral amino acid transport system, since brain uptake of glucose, inulin, and tyramine was unaffected while blood-brain arginine transport was significantly reduced. These results strikingly confirm the hypothesis that carrier-mediated blood-brain transport is the limiting factor determining the availability of the neutral amino acids to the brain. The encephalopathy associated with cirrhosis may be the result of abnormal neurotransmitter metabolism and neurotransmission secondary to increased neutral amino acid transport activity and an increased brain content of members of the neutral amino acid group."
https://openalex.org/W2043390818,"Antibodies to insulin receptors purified from rat liver membranes do not complete with [125I]insulin for binding to the insulin receptor but do precipitate solubilized receptors labeled with [125I]insulin. These antibodies have the insulin-like activities of enhancing glucose oxidation and inhibiting epinephrine-induced lipolysis in rat adipocytes. Thus, antibody binds to the receptor at a different site from that to which insulin binds, yet the interaction can initiate an effective biological response. These results indicate that the previously studied insulin-binding sites are the physiological macromolecular receptors for insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2056870501,"In search of repeatable ESP experiments, modern investigators are using more complex targets, richer and freer responses, feedback, and more naturalistic conditions. This makes tractable statistical models less applicable. Moreover, controls often are so loose that no valid statistical analysis is possible. Some common problems are multiple end points, subject cheating, and unconscious sensory cueing. Unfortunately, such problems are hard to recognize from published records of the experiments in which they occur; rather, these problems are often uncovered by reports of independent skilled observers who were present during the experiment. This suggests that magicians and psychologists be regularly used as observers. New statistical ideas have been developed for some of the new experiments. For example, many modern ESP studies provide subjects with feedback--partial information about previous guesses--to reward the subjects for correct guesses in hope of inducing ESP learning. Some feedback experiments can be analyzed with the use of skill-scoring, a statistical procedure that depends on the information available and the way the guessing subject uses this information."
https://openalex.org/W1967538789,"The swimming movement of the leech is produced by an ensemble of bilaterally symmetric, rhythmically active pairs of motor neurons present in each segmental ganglion of the ventral nerve cord. These motor neurons innervate the longitudinal muscles in dorsal or ventral sectors of the segmental body wall. Their duty cycles are phase-locked in a manner such that the dorsal and ventral body wall sectors of any given segment undergo an antiphasic contractile rhythm and that the contractile rhythms of different segments form a rostrocaudal phase progression. This activity rhythm is imposed on the motor neurons by a central swim oscillator, of which four bilaterally symmetric pairs of interneurons present in each segmental ganglion appear to constitute the major component. These interneurons are linked intra- and intersegmentally via inhibitory connections to form a segmentally iterated and intersegmentally concatenated cyclic neuronal network. The network appears to owe its oscillatory activity pattern to the mechanism of recurrent cyclic inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W1966569811,"Inflatable pyloric cuffs and stomach tubes were implanted in rats. With the cuff inflated and a valve to limit intragastric pressure to that accompanying normal satiety, they drank only as much when they had been deprived of food for 12 hours as without inflation of the cuff. However, they overdrank with the cuff inflated when they had been water deprived for 12 hours. When 10 ml of milk was withdrawn from the stomach with the cuff inflated, compensatory drinking occurred. Further, compensatory drinking also occurred when milk escaped from the stomach into the duodenum. Satiety signals thus arise from the stomach."
https://openalex.org/W2058164218,"Subjects who were either high or low in trait anxiety used alpha feedback to increase and to decrease their electroencephalographic alpha activity. The alpha changes were tightly linked to anxiety changes, but only in high anxiety subjects (for whom anxiety was reduced in proportion to alpha increases, and was increased in proportion to alpha suppression). Low trait-anxiety subjects were superior at both enhancement and suppression training, but their alpha changes were not related to anxiety changes. In both groups, anxiety changes were generally unrelated to either resting levels or changes in frontalis electromyograms and respiration rate. These results suggest that long-term alpha feedback training (at least 5 hours) may be useful in anxiety therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2070347328,"Although the phenomena of extended x=ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were observed as early as the 1930's, EXAFS has only recently, with the utilization of synchrotron radiation, been transformed into a powerful structural technique. The theory and experimental practice of the technique are described and illustrated with data on germanium. Applications to systems as diverse as hemoglobin, polymer-bound catalysts, ions in solution, amorphous solids, and adsorbate atoms on surfaces are reviewed. With the recent approval of funding for new, more powerful dedicated synchrotron sources, the future holds the possibility of a virtual revolution in structure determinations."

https://openalex.org/W2083870276,"Degradation of acetylcholine receptors of intact mouse neuromuscular junctions was determined in vivo and in vitro by the release of radioactivity from mouse diaphragms labeled with 125I-Î±-bungarotoxin. Treatment of mice with immunoglobulin from myasthenic patients accelerated the degradation rate to approximately three times normal, in both intact animals and organ cultures. The released radioactivity was in the form of [125I]tyrosine, confirming the nature of the degradative process. Accelerated degradation of acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions may represent an important antibody-mediated mechanism in myasthenia gravis."
https://openalex.org/W2082464217,"Throbin-activated human platelets cause agglutination of trypsinized, formalinized bovine erythrocytes. This lectin activity of stimulated platelets was blocked by galactosamine, glucosamine, mannosamine, lysine, and arginine, but not by N-acetylated sugars, other neutral sugars, or other amino acids. Inhibitors of the thrombin-induced lectin activity also blocked thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. It appears that a membrane surface component that has lectin activity mediates platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1976833271,"Diffusional motions of 1,6-diphenyl-1, 3, 5-hexatriene (DPH) were observed by differential polarized phase fluorometry. The measurements indicated that the depolarizing rotations of DPH in propylene glycol are isotropic. The results in vesicles of dimyristoyl-L-Î±-phosphatidylcholine indicated that diffusional rotations of DPH are dominated by hindered torsional motions. Combined use of both differential phase and steady-state anisotropy measurements showed that the average rotational angle of DPH, at times long compared to the fluorescence lifetime, is limited to about 23Â° at temperatures below the transition temperature of the lipid and that these rotations become less hindered above the transition temperature. The evidence that the depolarizing rotations of DPH in a lipid bilayer are different from those in an isotropic solvent calls into question the meaning of membrane microviscosity as determined by fluorescence anisotropy."

https://openalex.org/W2081728805,Subpicosecond pulses have been used to study the ultrafast dynamics of the photochemistry of bacteriorhodopsin. An optically induced absorption that appears in about 1.0 picosecond at physiological temperatures has been resolved in time. The data can be interpreted in terms of the photochemical formation of bathobacteriorhodopsin and provide support for an excitation mechanisms involving molecular rearrangement in the protein induced by electron redistribution in the chromophore.

This locus, along with the lymphocyte defined loci previously reported, establishes the existence of a major histocompatibility system of cattle."
https://openalex.org/W1979337789,"By injecting plastic microspheres of a specific size (3 to 4 micrometers) into the circulation and following their movement and distribution in the spleen, it was revealed how blood travels from the arterial capillaries to the venous sinuses. This method demonstrated that both open and closed circulation exist in the spleen and that about 90 percent of the blood takes the open route of circulation in the normal unanesthetized rabbit."
https://openalex.org/W2012871154,"Recent field experiments demonstrated the possibility of using the sterile male method for the control of Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann, the most important vector of human malaria in Central America. Until now there was no practical method for excluding females from the releases of sterile males. A genetic method was developed for the preferential elimination of females during any of the four life stages. This genetic sexing system utilizes propoxur (o-isopropoxyphenyl methyl-carbamate) susceptibility as a recessive conditional lethal a T(Y:2R) translocation, and an In(2R)inversion. The propoxur resistance allele (dominant) was linked to the Y chromosome via a radiation-induced translocation, and genetic recombination was suppressed by inversions. In one of the strains produced, 99.7 percent of the females are eliminated when treated with propoxur, without male loss."

https://openalex.org/W2076095905,"In cultures made from disaggregated human epidermal cells, growth to a confluent cell layer is followed by the emergence of patterns resembling those of human dermatoglyphs. These patterns reflect intrinsic properties of kertinocytes. In vivo, only the epidermis of the volar surfaces forms patterns, but in culture, patterns are formed by epidermal cells from other sites as well. Patterns develop by a process of cell movement which first produces ridges and then curves the ridges into figures of increasing complexity, ultimately whorls."
https://openalex.org/W1964469893,"In all species studied, the medial preoptic area has been found to be necessary for male copulatory behavior. No recovery of sexual function from the medial preoptic area lesions appears to have been reported. This study demonstrates that rats with large lesions of the medial preoptic area exhibit adult male sexual behavior when the surgery is performed prepuberally and the rats have interacted socially with peers."
https://openalex.org/W2059910462,"The city of Warsaw was razed at the end of World War II and rebuilt under a socialist government whose policy was to allocate dwellings, schools, and health facilities without regard to social class. Of the 14,238 children born in 1963 and living in Warsaw, 96 percent were given the Raven's Progressive Matrices Test and an arithmetic and a vocabulary test in March to June of 1974. Information was collected on the families of the children, and on characteristics of schools and city districts. Parental occupation and education were used to form a family factor, and the district data were collapsed into two factors, one relating to social marginality, and the other to distance from city center. Analysis showed that the initial assumption of even distribution of family, school, and district attributes was reasonable. Mental performance was unrelated either to school or district factors; it was related to parental occupation and education in a strong and regular gradient. It is concluded that an egalitarian social policy executed over a generation failed to override the association of social and family factors with cognitive development that is characteristic of more traditional industrial societies."
https://openalex.org/W2072163963,"The immunosuppressive drug 6-mercaptopurine is embryotoxic in mice. Of the surviving female offspring of mice treated with low doses of 6-mercaptopurine during pregnancy, despite normal body weight and general appearance, many were either sterile or, if they became pregnant, had smaller litters and more dead fetuses as compared to offspring of mothers that had not received the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2066349924,Cats were classically conditioned after the baroreceptor reflexes were abolished by bilateral placement of electrolytic lesions in the nucleus tractus solitarii. The conditioned increases in arterial pressure were more than five times larger than the responses obtained in similarly trained controls. This finding suggests that the baroreceptor reflexes actively inhibit conditioned increases of arterial pressure.
https://openalex.org/W1974578254,"3-Methylindole, a ruminal fermentation product of tryptophan, induces acute pulmonary edema and emphysema in cattle, and 3-methylindole is present in the ruminal fluid and blood of cows with a natually occurring form of this disease. Monensin, a polyether antibiotic and widely used feed additive for beef cattle, prevented tryptophan-induced acute bovine pulmonary edema and emphysema. Monensin acted by reducing the ruminal conversion of L-tryptophan to 3-methylindole both in vitro and in vivo. Lasalocid, also a polyether antibiotic, showed similar effects in vitro. These results provide a promising approach to prevention of this major respiratory disease of cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2003767356,"Visual sensitivity of one eye was determined under binocular stimulus conditions yielding apparent fusion, stereopsis, monocular dominance, and monocular suppression. Marked losses in sensitivity accompanied monocular suppression but were not evident during stable singel vision. The results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that supression alone mediates binocular single vision."

https://openalex.org/W1982348801,"THE dominant T mutation in the t complex on chromosome 17 of the mouse causes a shortening of the tail in heterozygotes and embryonic lethality in homozygotes1. Recessive t alleles are defined by their interaction with T to cause tail-lessness in double heterozygotes (T/t) and are often associated with three other properties: (1) homozygous lethality at several different embryonic stages, (2) effects on male reproduction including sterility and transmission ratio distortion, and (3) crossover suppression2,3. Although the multiplicity of these effects suggests that several genes are involved, crossover suppression has made classical genetic analysis of the region difficult. As T/t animals are viable, the lethal factors associated with recessive t homozygosity cannot be allelic to those associated with T homozygosity. Lyon et al. studied exceptional crossovers and found evidence that the homozygous lethality of t alleles and their property of interacting with T to cause tail-lessness were specified at different genetic loci4,5. We have studied a presumed deletion, Torl in crosses with recessive t alleles as well as with alleles at closely linked loci to map further the multiple effects associated with the t complex. We report here that factors associated with t lethality are distal to the Torl deletion and separable from those responsible for at least one kind ot t allele-associated male sterility apparently included in the deletion."

While the mercury-size trend is consistent with data for other species, the latitudinal trend is opposite to that reported for other fishes over the same geographical area. Consequently, latitudinal trends of mercury concentrations in fishes do not necessarily indicate trends of mercury concentrations in water. Food habits and metabolism may cause the observed variations."

https://openalex.org/W2029486152,"The article argues that insufficient attention has been paid to the operational aspects of the U.S. radioactive waste management system when it grows to the scale necessary to handle wastes produced by a fully deployed plutonium economy. Without such information, many of the unsettling speculations which have become part of the public debate and are summarized herein cannot be clearly addressed. The article then outlines the types of information necessary to begin estimating the costs and consequences of radioactive waste management. Finally, an index of social exposure to radioactive hazard is proposed to improve the basis for policy decisions in this area."
https://openalex.org/W1971621356,Intracellular recordings were used to measure the action spectrum of light adaptation in barnacle photoreceptors. The action spectrum closely resembles the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin (lambdamax at 530 nanometers) and is clearly different from that of metarhodopsin (lambdamax at 495 nanometers). These results suggest that absorption of light by rhodopsin initiates both excitation and light adaptation. The previously reported antagonistic process initiated by metarhodopsin does not appear to play a role at moderate light intensities.
