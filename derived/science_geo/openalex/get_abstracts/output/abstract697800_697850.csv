https://openalex.org/W4288447807,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal and treatment-refractory cancer. Molecular stratification in pancreatic cancer remains rudimentary and does not yet inform clinical management or therapeutic development. Here, we construct a high-resolution molecular landscape of the cellular subtypes and spatial communities that compose PDAC using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and whole-transcriptome digital spatial profiling (DSP) of 43 primary PDAC tumor specimens that either received neoadjuvant therapy or were treatment naive. We uncovered recurrent expression programs across malignant cells and fibroblasts, including a newly identified neural-like progenitor malignant cell program that was enriched after chemotherapy and radiotherapy and associated with poor prognosis in independent cohorts. Integrating spatial and cellular profiles revealed three multicellular communities with distinct contributions from malignant, fibroblast and immune subtypes: classical, squamoid-basaloid and treatment enriched. Our refined molecular and cellular taxonomy can provide a framework for stratification in clinical trials and serve as a roadmap for therapeutic targeting of specific cellular phenotypes and multicellular interactions."

https://openalex.org/W4288429595,"Anorexia and fasting are host adaptations to acute infection, inducing a metabolic switch towards ketogenesis and the production of ketone bodies, including β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) 1-6. However, whether ketogenesis metabolically influences the immune response in pulmonary infections remains unclear. Here we report impaired production of BHB in humans with SARS-CoV-2-induced but not influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CD4+ T cell function is impaired in COVID-19 and BHB promotes both survival and production of Interferon-γ from CD4+ T cells. Using metabolic tracing analysis, we uncovered that BHB provides an alternative carbon source to fuel oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the production of bioenergetic amino acids and glutathione, which is important for maintaining the redox balance. T cells from patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS were exhausted and skewed towards glycolysis, but can be metabolically reprogrammed by BHB to perform OXPHOS, thereby increasing their functionality. Finally, we demonstrate that ketogenic diet (KD) and delivery of BHB as ketone ester drink restores CD4+ T cell metabolism and function in respiratory infections, ultimately reducing the mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. Altogether, our data reveal BHB as alternative carbon source promoting T cell responses in pulmonary viral infections, highlighting impaired ketogenesis as a potential confounder of severe COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4288447410,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has yielded seemingly disparate insights into large-scale organization of the human brain. The brain's large-scale organization can be divided into two broad categories: zero-lag representations of functional connectivity structure and time-lag representations of traveling wave or propagation structure. In this study, we sought to unify observed phenomena across these two categories in the form of three low-frequency spatiotemporal patterns composed of a mixture of standing and traveling wave dynamics. We showed that a range of empirical phenomena, including functional connectivity gradients, the task-positive/task-negative anti-correlation pattern, the global signal, time-lag propagation patterns, the quasiperiodic pattern and the functional connectome network structure, are manifestations of these three spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns account for much of the global spatial structure that underlies functional connectivity analyses and unifies phenomena in resting-state functional MRI previously thought distinct."

Despite extensive research, the mechanistic details of ATP-dependent energy transduction and dinitrogen reduction by nitrogenase are not well understood, requiring new strategies to monitor its structural dynamics during catalytic action. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of the nitrogenase complex prepared under enzymatic turnover conditions. We observe that asymmetry governs all aspects of the nitrogenase mechanism, including ATP hydrolysis, protein-protein interactions, and catalysis. Conformational changes near the catalytic iron-molybdenum cofactor are correlated with the nucleotide-hydrolysis state of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W4288428126,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with a state of vaginal dysbiosis typically involving depletion of otherwise dominant populations of Lactobacillus . The causes of this microbial succession are not known; there may be multiple causes. Standard treatment includes oral metronidazole, which typically restores Lactobacillus species to dominance. However, recurrence rates are high; recurrent BV patients recur 3–4 times annually and are often refractory to treatment. Our previous qPCR-based study of recurrent BV patients pointed to putatively more virulent species of Gardnerella that were associated with refractory responses to oral metronidazole, and less robust recovery of Lactobacillus species associated with recurrence after an initial period of remission. However, these associations did not account for outcomes in all patients, suggesting that other bacterial species were involved. In this follow-up study, we sequenced the V4 domain of 16S rRNA sequences of 41of these same patients pre- and posttreatment. Overall compositions among pretreatment clinical outcome groups were not different, although alpha diversity significantly decreased: refractory &gt; recurrent &gt; remission. Combinations of key species were associated with and prognostic for outcome. Higher pretreatment abundance of Megasphaera lornae together with lower abundance of Gardnerella Gsp07 and Finegoldia magna predicted long term remission after oral metronidazole. Furthermore, a subset of refractory patients that did not have high levels of Gardnerella Gsp07 , instead had elevated levels of alternative species including Atopobium vaginae , Mageeibacillus indolicus (BVAB3) , and Prevotella timonensis . Patients who recurred after transient remission had elevated abundance of species including Atopobium vaginae , Gardnerella , and Aerococcus christensenii , compared to long-term remission patients. Core bacterial species among refractory patients did not change in abundance after metronidazole, suggesting resistance or tolerance, in contrast to the loss in abundance of the same species among recurrent or remission patients. These findings have potential prognostic and therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W4288436207,"Ferlins are complex, multi-domain proteins, involved in membrane trafficking, membrane repair, and exocytosis. The large size of ferlin proteins and the lack of consensus regarding domain boundaries have slowed progress in understanding molecular-level details of ferlin protein structure and function. However, in silico protein folding techniques have significantly enhanced our understanding of the complex ferlin family domain structure. We used RoseTTAFold to assemble full-length models for the six human ferlin proteins (dysferlin, myoferlin, otoferlin, Fer1L4, Fer1L5, and Fer1L6). Our full-length ferlin models were used to obtain objective domain boundaries, and these boundaries were supported by AlphaFold2 predictions. Despite the differences in amino acid sequence between the ferlin proteins, the domain ranges and distinct subdomains in the ferlin domains are remarkably consistent. Further, the RoseTTAFold/AlphaFold2 in silico boundary predictions allowed us to describe and characterize a previously unknown C2 domain, ubiquitous in all human ferlins, which we refer to as C2-FerA. At present, the ferlin domain-domain interactions implied by the full-length in silico models are predicted to have a low accuracy; however, the use of RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold2 as a domain finder has proven to be a powerful research tool for understanding ferlin structure."
https://openalex.org/W4288696715,"The increasing rate of antimicrobial-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae poses a considerable public health threat due to the difficulty in treating gonococcal infections. This study examined antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to drugs recommended for gonorrhea treatment between 2015 and 2017, and the AMR determinants and genetic compositions of plasmids in 3 gonococcal strains with high-level penicillin resistance.We collected 117 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from patients with gonococcal infections who attended Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 2015 and 2017. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, spectinomycin, cefixime, and ceftriaxone were determined by the agar dilution method. PCR amplification and sequencing of 23S rRNA and mtrR (a negative regulator of MtrCDE efflux pump) were performed. Whole genomes of 3 PPNG strains with high-level penicillin resistance (MIC ≥ 128 μg/ml) were sequenced using Illumina and Nanopore sequencing platforms.The proportions of N. gonorrhoeae isolates with resistance were 84.6% for penicillin, 91.5% for tetracycline, and 96.6% for ciprofloxacin. All isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin, azithromycin, cefixime, and ceftriaxone. An adenine deletion within a 13 bp inverted repeat sequence in the mtrR promoter and an H105Y mutation in the mtrR coding region were found in the N. gonorrhoeae isolate with the highest azithromycin MIC value (1 μg/ml). Three high-level penicillin-resistant isolates contained nonmosaic type II penA and had mutations in penB and the mtrR coding region. All isolates with high-level penicillin resistance carried the conjugative plasmids with or without the Dutch type tetM determinant, the beta-lactamase plasmid (Rio/Toronto), and the cryptic plasmid.The gonococcal population in Thailand showed high susceptibility to ceftriaxone and azithromycin, current dual therapy recommended for gonorrhea treatment. As elevated MIC of azithromycin has been observed in 1 strain of N. gonorrhoeae, expanded and enhanced surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility and study of genetic resistance determinants are essential to improve treatment guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W4288434566,"Abstract Mouse haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), on the ventral surface of the dorsal aorta, by endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition. We investigated whether mesenchymal stem cells, which provide an essential niche for long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) in the bone marrow, reside in the aorta–gonad–mesonephros and contribute to the development of the dorsal aorta and endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition. Here we show that mesoderm-derived PDGFRA + stromal cells ( Mesp1 der PSCs) contribute to the haemogenic endothelium of the dorsal aorta and populate the E10.5–E11.5 aorta–gonad–mesonephros but by E13.5 were replaced by neural-crest-derived PSCs ( Wnt1 der PSCs). Co-aggregating non-haemogenic endothelial cells with Mesp1 der PSCs but not Wnt1 der PSCs resulted in activation of a haematopoietic transcriptional programme in endothelial cells and generation of LT-HSCs. Dose-dependent inhibition of PDGFRA or BMP, WNT and NOTCH signalling interrupted this reprogramming event. Together, aorta–gonad–mesonephros Mesp1 der PSCs could potentially be harnessed to manufacture LT-HSCs from endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W4288703686,"We developed a simple tool to estimate the probability of dying from acute COVID-19 illness only with readily available assessments at initial admission.This retrospective study included 13,190 racially and ethnically diverse adults admitted to one of the New York City Health + Hospitals (NYC H+H) system for COVID-19 illness between March 1 and June 30, 2020. Demographic characteristics, simple vital signs and routine clinical laboratory tests were collected from the electronic medical records. A clinical prediction model to estimate the risk of dying during the hospitalization were developed.Mean age (interquartile range) was 58 (45-72) years; 5421 (41%) were women, 5258 were Latinx (40%), 3805 Black (29%), 1168 White (9%), and 2959 Other (22%). During hospitalization, 2,875 were (22%) died. Using separate test and validation samples, machine learning (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) identified eight variables-oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse rate, blood urea nitrogen level, age and creatinine-that predicted mortality, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 94%. A score based on these variables classified 5,677 (46%) as low risk (a score of 0) who had 0.8% (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.0%) risk of dying, and 674 (5.4%) as high-risk (score ≥ 12 points) who had a 97.6% (96.5-98.8%) risk of dying; the remainder had intermediate risks. A risk calculator is available online at https://danielevanslab.shinyapps.io/Covid_mortality/.In a diverse population of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness, a clinical prediction model using a few readily available vital signs reflecting the severity of disease may precisely predict in-hospital mortality in diverse populations and can rapidly assist decisions to prioritize admissions and intensive care."
https://openalex.org/W4288704366,"We aimed to develop prediction models for depression among U.S. adults with hypertension using various machine learning (ML) approaches. Moreover, we analyzed the mechanisms of the developed models. This cross-sectional study included 8,628 adults with hypertension (11.3% with depression) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011–2020). We selected several significant features using feature selection methods to build the models. Data imbalance was managed with random down-sampling. Six different ML classification methods implemented in the R package caret —artificial neural network, random forest, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient boosting, XGBoost, and support vector machine—were employed with 10-fold cross-validation for predictions. Model performance was assessed by examining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. For an interpretable algorithm, we used the variable importance evaluation function in caret . Of all classification models, artificial neural network trained with selected features (n = 30) achieved the highest AUC (0.813) and specificity (0.780) in predicting depression. Support vector machine predicted depression with the highest accuracy (0.771), precision (0.969), sensitivity (0.774), and F1-score (0.860). The most frequent and important features contributing to the models included the ratio of family income to poverty, triglyceride level, white blood cell count, age, sleep disorder status, the presence of arthritis, hemoglobin level, marital status, and education level. In conclusion, ML algorithms performed comparably in predicting depression among hypertensive populations. Furthermore, the developed models shed light on variables’ relative importance, paving the way for further clinical research."
https://openalex.org/W4288710357,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been causing the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has so far resulted in over 450 million infections and six million deaths. This respiratory virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a receptor to enter host cells and affects various tissues in addition to the lungs. The present study reports that the placental arteries of women who gave birth to live full-term newborns while developing COVID-19 during pregnancy exhibit severe vascular wall thickening and the occlusion of the vascular lumen. A morphometric analysis of the placental arteries stained with hematoxylin and eosin suggests a 2-fold increase in wall thickness and a 5-fold decrease in the lumen area. Placental vascular remodeling was found to occur in all of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers as defined by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry with α-smooth muscle actin and the Kv11.1 channel as well as Masson's trichrome staining showed that such placental vascular remodeling in COVID-19 is associated with smooth muscle proliferation and fibrosis. Placental vascular remodeling may represent a response mechanism to the clinical problems associated with childbirth in COVID-19 patients.
https://openalex.org/W4288441833,"Variation in the antibacterial potency of manuka honey has been reported in several published studies. However, many of these studies examine only a few honey samples, or test activity against only a few bacterial isolates. To address this deficit, a collection of 29 manuka/ Leptospermum honeys was obtained, comprising commercial manuka honeys from Australia and New Zealand and several Western Australian Leptospermum honeys obtained directly from beekeepers. The antibacterial activity of honeys was quantified using several methods, including the broth microdilution method to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against four species of test bacteria, the phenol equivalence method, determination of antibacterial activity values from optical density, and time kill assays. Several physicochemical parameters or components were also quantified, including methylglyoxal (MGO), dihydroxyacetone (DHA), hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and total phenolics content as well as pH, colour and refractive index. Total antioxidant activity was also determined using the DPPH* (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP (ferric reducing–antioxidant power) assays. Levels of MGO quantified in each honey were compared to the levels stated on the product labels, which revealed mostly minor differences. Antibacterial activity studies showed that MICs varied between different honey samples and between bacterial species. Correlation of the MGO content of honey with antibacterial activity showed differing relationships for each test organism, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa showing no relationship, Staphylococcus aureus showing a moderate relationship and both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli showing strong positive correlations. The association between MGO content and antibacterial activity was further investigated by adding known concentrations of MGO to a multifloral honey and quantifying activity, and by also conducting checkerboard assays. These investigations showed that interactions were largely additive in nature, and that synergistic interactions between MGO and the honey matrix did not occur."
https://openalex.org/W3194250214,"Background: Thyroid volumetry is crucial in diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of thyroid diseases. However, conventional thyroid volumetry with 2D ultrasound is highly operator-dependent. This study compares 2D ultrasound and tracked 3D ultrasound with an automatic thyroid segmentation based on a deep neural network regarding inter- and intraobserver variability, time and accuracy. Volume reference was MRI. Methods: 28 healthy volunteers were scanned with 2D and 3D ultrasound as well as by MRI. Three physicians (MD 1, 2, 3) with different levels of experience (6, 4 and 1 a) performed three 2D ultrasound and three tracked 3D ultrasound scans on each volunteer. In the 2D scans the thyroid lobe volumes were calculated with the ellipsoid formula. A convolutional deep neural network (CNN) segmented the 3D thyroid lobes automatically. On MRI (T1 VIBE sequence) the thyroid was manually segmented by an experienced medical doctor. Results: The CNN was trained to obtain a dice score of 0.94. The interobserver variability comparing two MDs showed mean differences for 2D and 3D respectively of 0.58 ml to 0.52 ml (MD1 vs. 2), -1.33 ml to -0.17 ml (MD1 vs. 3) and -1.89 ml to -0.70 ml (MD2 vs. 3). Paired samples t-tests showed significant differences in two comparisons for 2D and none for 3D. Intraobsever variability was similar for 2D and 3D ultrasound. Comparison of ultrasound volumes and MRI volumes by paired samples t-tests showed a significant difference for the 2D volumetry of all MDs, and no significant difference for 3D ultrasound. Acquisition time was significantly shorter for 3D ultrasound. Conclusion: Tracked 3D ultrasound combined with a CNN segmentation significantly reduces interobserver variability in thyroid volumetry and increases the accuracy of the measurements with shorter acquisition times."

https://openalex.org/W4288696158,"The 2019 novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in an unsustainable need for diagnostic tests. Currently, molecular tests are the accepted standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Mass spectrometry (MS) enhanced by machine learning (ML) has recently been postulated to serve as a rapid, high-throughput, and low-cost alternative to molecular methods. Automated ML is a novel approach that could move mass spectrometry techniques beyond the confines of traditional laboratory settings. However, it remains unknown how different automated ML platforms perform for COVID-19 MS analysis. To this end, the goal of our study is to compare algorithms produced by two commercial automated ML platforms (Platforms A and B). Our study consisted of MS data derived from 361 subjects with molecular confirmation of COVID-19 status including SARS-CoV-2 variants. The top optimized ML model with respect to positive percent agreement (PPA) within Platforms A and B exhibited an accuracy of 94.9%, PPA of 100%, negative percent agreement (NPA) of 93%, and an accuracy of 91.8%, PPA of 100%, and NPA of 89%, respectively. These results illustrate the MS method’s robustness against SARS-CoV-2 variants and highlight similarities and differences in automated ML platforms in producing optimal predictive algorithms for a given dataset."
https://openalex.org/W4288704154,"Background Few studies have analyzed the different biomechanical properties of the lumbar with various morphological parameters, which play an important role in injury and degeneration. This study aims to preliminarily investigate biomechanical characteristics of the spine with different sagittal alignment morphotypes by using finite element (FE) simulation and in-vitro testing. Methods According to the lumbar-pelvic radiographic parameters of the Chinese population, the parametric FE models (L1-S1-pelvis) of Roussouly’s type (1–4) were validated and developed based on the in-vitro biomechanical testing. A pure moment of 7.5 Nm was applied in the three anatomical planes to simulate the physiological activities of flexion, extension, left-right lateral bending and left-right axial rotation. Results The sagittal configuration of four Roussouly’s type models had a strong effect on the biomechanical responses in flexion and extension. The apex of the lumbar lordosis is a critical position where the segment has the lowest range of motion among all the models. In flexion-extension, type 3 and 4 models with a good lordosis shape had a more uniform rotation distribution at each motor function segment, however, type 1 and 2 models with a straighter spine had a larger proportion of rotation at the L5-S1 level. In addition, type 1 and 2 models had higher intradiscal pressures (IDPs) at the L4-5 segment in flexion, while type 4 model had larger matrix and fiber stresses at the L5-S1 segment in extension. Conclusion The well-marched lordotic type 3 lumbar had greater stability, however, a straighter spine (type 1 and 2) had poor balance and load-bearing capacity. The hypolordotic type 4 model showed larger annulus fiber stress. Therefore, the sagittal alignment of Roussouly’s type models had different kinetic and biomechanical responses under various loading conditions, leading to different clinical manifestations of the lumbar disease."
https://openalex.org/W4288705947,"Introduction Outside of pandemics, there is little information about occurrence of prolonged unplanned K-12 school closures (PUSC). We describe here the reasons, characteristics, and patterns of PUSC in the United States during 8 consecutive inter-pandemic academic years, 2011–2019. Methods From August 1, 2011 through June 30, 2019, daily systematic online searches were conducted to collect data on publicly announced unplanned school closures lasting ≥1 school days in the United States. Closures were categorized as prolonged when schools were closed for ≥5 unplanned days (approximating one full workweek), excluding weekends and scheduled days off per school calendars. Results During the eight academic years, a total of 22,112 PUSCs were identified, affecting over 800,000 teachers and 13 million students that resulted in 91.5 million student-days lost. A median of 62.9% of students in PUSC-affected schools were eligible for subsidized school meals. Most affected schools were in cities (35%) and suburban areas (33%). Natural disasters (47%), adverse weather conditions (35%), and budget/teacher strikes (15%) were the most frequently cited reasons for PUSC; illness accounted for 1%, and building/facility issues, environmental issues and violence together accounted for the remaining 2%. The highest number of PUSCs occurred in Health and Human Services Regions 2, 3, 4, and 6 encompassing areas that are frequently in the path of hurricanes and tropical storms. The majority of PUSCs in these regions were attributed to a handful of hurricanes during the fall season, including hurricanes Sandy, Irma, Harvey, Florence, and Matthew. Conclusions PUSCs occur annually in the United States due to a variety of causes and are associated with a substantive loss of student-days for in-school learning. Both these prior experiences with PUSCs and those during the current COVID-19 pandemic illustrate a need for creating sustainable solutions for high-quality distance learning and innovative supplemental feeding programs nationwide, especially in disaster-prone areas."
https://openalex.org/W4288426077,"This time-motion study explored the amount of time clinicians spent on wound assessments in a real-world environment using wound assessment digital application utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs. manual methods. The study also aimed at comparing the proportion of captured quality wound images on the first attempt by the assessment method.Clinicians practicing at Valley Wound Center who agreed to join the study were asked to record the time needed to complete wound assessment activities for patients with active wounds referred for a routine evaluation on the follow-up days at the clinic. Assessment activities included: labelling wounds, capturing images, measuring wounds, calculating surface areas, and transferring data into the patient's record.A total of 91 patients with 115 wounds were assessed. The average time to capture and access wound image with the AI digital tool was significantly faster than a standard digital camera with an average of 62 seconds (P<0.001). The digital application was significantly faster by 77% at accurately measuring and calculating the wound surface area with an average of 45.05 seconds (P<0.001). Overall, the average time to complete a wound assessment using Swift was significantly faster by 79%. Using the AI application, the staff completed all steps in about half of the time (54%) normally spent on manual wound evaluation activities. Moreover, acquiring acceptable wound image was significantly more likely to be achieved the first time using the digital tool than the manual methods (92.2% vs. 75.7%, P<0.004).Using the digital assessment tool saved significant time for clinicians in assessing wounds. It also successfully captured quality wound images at the first attempt."
https://openalex.org/W4288442515,"Introduction This study developed a novel risk assessment model to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. It uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to develop an easy-to-use model with high accuracy, calibrated based on the Isfahan Cohort Study (ICS) database. Methods The ICS was a population-based prospective cohort study of 6,504 healthy Iranian adults aged ≥ 35 years followed for incident CVD over ten years, from 2001 to 2010. To develop a risk score, the problem of predicting CVD was solved using a well-designed GA, and finally, the results were compared with classic machine learning (ML) and statistical methods. Results A number of risk scores such as the WHO, and PARS models were utilized as the baseline for comparison due to their similar chart-based models. The Framingham and PROCAM models were also applied to the dataset, with the area under a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) equal to 0.633 and 0.683, respectively. However, the more complex Deep Learning model using a three-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) performed best among the ML models, with an AUROC of 0.74, and the GA-based eXplanaible Persian Atherosclerotic CVD Risk Stratification (XPARS) showed higher performance compared to the statistical methods. XPARS with eight features showed an AUROC of 0.76, and the XPARS with four features, showed an AUROC of 0.72. Conclusion A risk model that is extracted using GA substantially improves the prediction of CVD compared to conventional methods. It is clear, interpretable and can be a suitable replacement for conventional statistical methods."
https://openalex.org/W4288699031,"Background and objectives Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes wide range of nosocomial and community-acquired infections which have spread worldwide leading to an urgent need for developing effective anti-staphylococcal agents. Efflux is an important resistance mechanism that bacteria used to fight the antimicrobial action. This study aimed to investigate the efflux mechanism in S . aureus and assess diclofenac, domperidone, glyceryl trinitrate and metformin as potential efflux pump inhibitors that can be used in combination with antibiotics for treating topical infections caused by S . aureus . Materials and methods Efflux was detected qualitatively by the ethidium bromide Cart-Wheel method followed by investigating the presence of efflux genes by polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-six isolates were selected for further investigation of efflux by Cart-Wheel method in absence and presence of tested compounds followed by quantitative efflux assay. Furthermore, antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations in absence and presence of tested compounds were determined. The effects of tested drugs on expression levels of efflux genes nor A, fex A and tet K were determined by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. Results Efflux was found in 65.3% of isolates, the prevalence of nor A, tet K, fex A and msr A genes were 91.7%, 77.8%, 27.8% and 6.9%. Efflux assay revealed that tested drugs had potential efflux inhibitory activities, reduced the antibiotic’s MICs and significantly decreased the relative expression of efflux genes. Conclusion Diclofenac sodium, domperidone and glyceryl trinitrate showed higher efflux inhibitory activities than verapamil and metformin. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows that diclofenac sodium, glyceryl trinitrate and domperidone have efflux pump inhibitory activities against S . aureus ."
https://openalex.org/W4288701821,"To assess morbidity and mortality of parainfluenza virus (PIV) infections in immunocompromised patients, we analysed PIV infections in a hematology and stem cell transplantation (SCT) unit over the course of three years. Isolated PIV strains were characterized by sequence analysis and nosocomial transmission was assessed including phylogenetic analysis of viral strains. 109 cases of PIV infection were identified, 75 in the setting of SCT. PIV type 3 (n = 68) was the most frequent subtype. PIV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was observed in 47 patients (43%) with a mortality of 19%. Severe leukopenia, prior steroid therapy and presence of co-infections were significant risk factors for development of PIV-LRTI in multivariate analysis. Prolonged viral shedding was frequently observed with a median duration of 14 days and up to 79 days, especially in patients after allogeneic SCT and with LRTI. Nosocomial transmission occurred in 47 patients. Phylogenetic analysis of isolated PIV strains and combination with clinical data enabled the identification of seven separate clusters of nosocomial transmission. In conclusion, we observed significant morbidity and mortality of PIV infection in hematology and transplant patients. The clinical impact of co-infections, the possibility of long-term viral shedding and frequent nosocomial transmission should be taken into account when designing infection control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4288429373,"Background Although consumption of ultra-processed and deep-fried foods among adolescents is a global health concern, little is known about its gender and socio-economic stratification in rural settings of low- and middle-income countries. We, thus, aimed to describe ultra-processed and deep-fried food consumption among rural adolescents by gender and socio-economic factors, and to explore their relative importance in shaping consumption. Methods This cross-sectional study drew on data from a household survey in Matlab, a rural sub-district in Bangladesh. The analytic sample comprised 2463 adolescents. We assessed consumption of four ultra-processed food groups: ready-to-eat or “instant” foods; confectionery, sweets and similar packaged products; savory snacks; sugar-sweetened beverage; and of deep-fried foods with a 24-hour, qualitative recall. Asset scores were constructed. Proportion of consumption was calculated and compared by gender and household wealth. Logistic regression models were fitted to isolate socio-demographic variables associated with consumption. Results Approximately 83% (81.5–84.4) adolescents consumed at least one ultra-processed or deep-fried item. Confectioneries were the most consumed (53.5%), whereas sugar-sweetened beverage was the least consumed (12%) group. Boys had greater odds of consumption than girls for all food groups. The association was strongest for sugar-sweetened beverage (adjusted odds ratio = 2.57; 95% CI: 1.97, 3.37), followed by deep-fried foods (adjusted odds ratio = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.66, 2.32) and ready-to-eat foods (adjusted odds ratio = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.45, 2.38). Belonging to the richest households was associated with ready-to-eat food consumption (adjusted odds ratio = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.16). Adolescents with higher educational attainment had lower odds of consuming sugar-sweetened beverage (adjusted odds ratio = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.98). Conclusion Consumption of packaged confectioneries, savory snacks, and deep-fried foods appeared common, while SSB consumption was relatively low. Role of gender was pre-eminent as consumption was more likely among boys across the food groups. This may disproportionately expose them to the risk of diet-related non-communicable diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4288436419,"Legal scholars have been trying to predict the outcomes of trials for a long time. In recent years, researchers have been harnessing advancements in machine learning to predict the behavior of natural and social processes. At the same time, the Brazilian judiciary faces a challenging number of new cases every year, which generates the need to improve the throughput of the justice system. Based on those premises, we trained three deep learning architectures, ULMFiT, BERT, and Big Bird, on 612,961 Federal Small Claims Courts appeals within the Brazilian 5th Regional Federal Court to predict their outcomes. We compare the predictive performance of the models to the predictions of 22 highly skilled experts. All models outperform human experts, with the best one achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.3688 compared to 0.1253 from the human experts. Our results demonstrate that natural language processing and machine learning techniques provide a promising approach for predicting legal outcomes. We also release the Brazilian Courts Appeal Dataset for the 5th Regional Federal Court (BrCAD-5), containing data from 765,602 appeals to promote further developments in this area."
https://openalex.org/W4288704170,"The aim of this study was to explore differences in trunk muscle activity on a stable and mobile seat for people after stroke and healthy participants. Trunk control exercises are known to have a beneficial effect on trunk control, balance, and mobility after stroke. The effect of such exercises could be enhanced by the use of a mobile seat to provide further training stimuli. However, little research on the musculoskeletal effects of trunk training on mobile seats has been carried out. On a stable and a mobile seat, thirteen people after stroke and fifteen healthy participants performed two selective trunk control exercises, which were lateral flexion initiated by the pelvis and the thorax. The maximal surface electromyography relative to static sitting of the muscles multifidus, erector spinae, and obliquus externus was recorded bilaterally. The effects of group, seat condition, trunk control exercise, and muscle side were investigated employing within-subject linear-mixed-models. Compared to the stable seat, the maximal muscle activity of people after stroke on the mobile seat was higher during the thorax-initiated exercise and lower during the pelvis-initiated exercise. Healthy participants showed opposite results with higher muscle activity on the mobile seat during the pelvis-initiated exercise. For trunk control training on a mobile seat with high muscle activation people after stroke should perform trunk control exercises initiated by the thorax, for training with lower muscle activity people after stroke should initiate selective trunk movements by the pelvis. The results can support the planning of progressive trunk control rehabilitation programs."
https://openalex.org/W4288707736,"Melioidosis is an underreported human disease of tropical and sub-tropical regions caused by the saprophyte Burkholderia pseudomallei . Although most global melioidosis cases are reported from tropical regions in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, there are multiple occurrences from sub-tropical regions, including the United States (U.S.). Most melioidosis cases reported from the continental U.S. are the result of acquiring the disease during travel to endemic regions or from contaminated imported materials. Only two human melioidosis cases from the continental U.S. have likely acquired B . pseudomallei directly from local environments and these cases lived only ~7 km from each other in rural Texas. In this study, we assessed the risk of acquiring melioidosis from the environment within the continental U.S. by surveying for B . pseudomallei in the environment in Texas where these two human melioidosis cases likely acquired their infections. We sampled the environment near the homes of the two cases and at additional sampling locations in surrounding counties in Texas that were selected based on ecological niche modeling. B . pseudomallei was not detected at the residences of these two cases or in the surrounding region. These negative data are important to demonstrate that B . pseudomallei is rare in the environment in the U.S. even at locations where locally acquired human cases likely have occurred, documenting the low risk of acquiring B . pseudomallei infection from the environment in the continental U.S."
https://openalex.org/W4288710338,"Background Emerging evidence shows allergic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and asthma, are risk factors of heart failure. However, the causal relationship between allergic diseases and heart failure is not clear. Methods We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis between allergic diseases and heart failure using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies from large GWAS consortia, with total sample size of 1.2 million. Independent instrumental variables for asthma and atopic dermatitis (P&lt;1×10 −5 ) were used as the exposure. We applied five models for the Mendelian randomization analysis. Finally, we performed the sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results. Results We have identified 55 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for asthma 54 independent SNPs for atopic dermatitis as our instrumental variables. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) analysis showed asthma was significantly associated with increased risk of heart failure (OR IVW = 1.04, 95% CI, 1.01–1.07, P = 0.03). The Mendelian randomization analysis using the other four models also showed consistent results with the IVW analysis. Similarly, atopic dermatitis was also significantly associated with an increased risk of heart failure (OR IVW = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.01–1.06, P = 0.01), consistent with the other four models. The sensitivity analysis showed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or results were driven by single SNPs. Conclusion Our study identified asthma and atopic dermatitis as a causal risk factor for heart failure and suggest inflammatory pathogenesis as a key factor contributing to the underlying mechanism. These findings emphasize the importance of asthma and allergy control in the prevention and management of heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W4288710342,"NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a flavoprotein that catalyzes two-electron reduction of quinone to hydroquinone by using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH), and functions as a scavenger for reactive oxygen species (ROS). The function of NQO1 in the immune response is not well known. In the present study, we demonstrated that Nqo1 -deficient T cells exhibited reduced induction of T helper 17 cells (Th17) in vitro during Th17(23)- and Th17(β)- skewing conditions. Nqo1 -deficient mice showed ameliorated symptoms in a Th17-dependent autoimmune Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Impaired Th17-differentiation was caused by overproduction of the immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-10. Increased IL-10 production in Nqo1 -deficient Th17 cells was associated with elevated intracellular Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Furthermore, overproduction of IL-10 in Th17 (β) cells was responsible for the ROS-dependent increase of c- avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (c -maf ) expression, despite the lack of dependency of c-maf in Th17(23) cells. Taken together, the results reveal a novel role of NQO1 in promoting Th17 development through the suppression of ROS mediated IL-10 production."
https://openalex.org/W4288384479,"Background and objectives Occupation and time‐use can never be separated because they are important criteria in determining one’s lifestyle, improvements of one’s lifestyle, and even the quality of life. The purpose of this study was to identify whether there is a difference in time‐use between the occupational balance (OB) group and occupational imbalance (OI) group and to determine the factors that influence the life satisfaction of those in the OB group. Methods This study sorted detailed activities of 9,228 participants who were over 65 years of age. Raw data of 2014 Korean Time Use Survey (KTUS) were used and the amount of time-use of older adults was classified into eight activity areas. This study classified the amount of time used by older adults for eight occupational areas, namely, activities of daily life (ADLs), instrumental ADL (IADLs), rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation. We identified areas of specific time differences between OB and OI groups, and confirmed variables affecting life satisfaction. Results The analysis of time-use corresponding to the eight occupational areas showed the greatest time-use for the instrumental activities of daily living, which averaged 1513.59 minutes (56.34%). The largest effect size was social participation (d = 1.38). As a result of analyzing the factors related to the life satisfaction of the OB group, we found that those who were younger (B = 0.02, p &lt; .001), females (B = -0.12, p &lt; .05), had a higher level of education (B = 0.65, p &lt; .001), had a lower need for care (B = -1.19, p &lt; .05), had a higher income (B = -0.43, p &lt; .001), and rural residence (B = 0.29, p &lt; .001) tended to have a higher life satisfaction. Conclusions This study may provide a basis for developing time‐use management and lifestyle redesign programs."
https://openalex.org/W4288445045,"The development of scientific technology for art authentication has elicited multidimensional evidence to distinguish forgeries from original artwork. Here, we analyzed the three-dimensional morphology of cracks that contain information, such as the painting features of artworks, using optical coherence tomography. The forgeries were produced by an expert from original oil paintings with cracks that occur owing to paint drying, canvas aging, and physical damage. Parameters, such as shape, width, and depth, were compared based on the cross-sectional images of the original and fake cracks. The original cracks were rectangular and inverted, but the fake cracks were relatively simple inverted triangles. The original cracks were as deep as the thickness of the upper layer and mostly were ""thin/deep"" or ""wide/shallow"". The fake cracks were observed to be ""'thin/shallow"" or ""wide/deep"". This study aims to improve the understanding of crack characteristics and promote the development of techniques for determining art authenticity."

The pandemic has been characterized by the development of a succession of variants containing mutations in the spike protein affecting infectiousness, virulence and efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. Resistance to vaccination and limitations in the current treatments available require the ongoing development of therapies especially for those with severe disease. The plant lectin Galanthus nivalis binds to mannose structures in the viral envelope. We hypothesized that viral binding should be unaffected by spike protein mutations. Known concentrations of seven clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants were spiked in medium and passed three times over columns containing 1 gm of GNA affinity resin. Percent decrease in viral titer was compared with a control sample. Viral capture efficiency was found to range from 53 to 89% for all variants. Extrapolation indicated that an adult Aethlon Hemopurifier® would have more than sufficient binding capacity for viral loads observed in adult patients with severe COVID-19 infection."

During the rounds, the items were revised, new items added for review, and their importance was rated on a five-point Likert scale in an online form. Those items that achieved a mean Likert rating of 4+ (rated important to very important) and ≥ 90.0% agreement among the experts were maintained in each round.The initial competencies list contained 30 items from the literature scoping review and online interview with 46 Brazilian healthcare practitioners. 25 experts (health personnel with publications on health literacy) were invited to participate in the e-Delphi rounds. Of the total of 56 items evaluated, 28 reached consensus among the experts. The Brazilian competencies list differed from other consensuses by the emphasis on professional commitment to the literacy in health, autonomy and social context of the patient.For the Brazilian context, 28 competencies are relevant to the practice of health literacy in health care.

https://openalex.org/W4288695362,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting over 50 million people worldwide in 2020 and this number will triple to 152 million by 2050. Much of the increase will be in developing countries like Colombia. In familial forms, highly penetrant mutations have been identified in three genes, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, supporting a role for amyloid-β peptide. In sporadic forms, more than 30 risk genes involved in the lipid metabolism, the immune system, and synaptic functioning mechanisms. We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to evaluate a family of 97 members, spanning three generations, with a familiar AD, and without mutations in APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2. We sequenced two affected and one unaffected member with the aim of identifying genetic variants that could explain the presence of the disease in the family and the candidate variants were validated in eleven members. We also built a structural model to try to determine the effect on protein function. WES analysis identified two rare variants in SORL1 and MTHFD1L genes segregating in the family with other potential risk variants in APOE, ABCA7, and CHAT, suggesting an oligogenic inheritance. Additionally, the structural 3D models of SORL1 and MTHFD1L variants shows that these variants produce polarity changes that favor hydrophobic interactions, resulting in local structural changes that could affect the protein function and may contribute to the development of the disease in this family."
https://openalex.org/W4288701846,"Prospective audit and feedback (PAF) is considered an effective procedure for appropriate antibiotic use. However, its effect on the time to de-escalation is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effect of daily PAF implementation, focusing on the time to de-escalation of anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) agents as an outcome measure. To this end, a single-center, retrospective, quasi-experimental study including patients treated with intravenous anti-MRSA agents during pre-PAF (April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015) and post-PAF (April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016) periods was conducted. The time to de-escalation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to assess the effect of daily PAF implementation on the time to de-escalation. Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between daily PAF implementation and anti-MRSA agent utilization data converted to defined daily dose (DDD) and days of therapy (DOT) per 1,000 patient days. The median time to de-escalation was significantly shorter in the post-PAF period than in the pre-PAF period (6 days vs. 7 days, P < 0.001). According to multivariate analysis, PAF implementation was independently associated with a shorter time to de-escalation (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.35). There were no significant differences in hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and length of stay between the two periods. Interrupted time series analysis showed significant reductions in the trends of DDD (trend change, -0.65; 95% CI, -1.20 to -0.11) and DOT (trend change, -0.74; 95% CI, -1.33 to -0.15) between the pre-PAF and post-PAF periods. Daily PAF implementation for patients treated with intravenous anti-MRSA agents led to a shorter time to de-escalation and lower consumption of anti-MRSA agents without worsening the clinically important outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4288704548,"The cell nucleus is a dynamic structure that changes locales during cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, or migration, and its mispositioning is a hallmark of several disorders. As with most mechanobiological activities of adherent cells, the repositioning and anchoring of the nucleus are presumed to be associated with the organization of the cytoskeleton, the network of protein filaments providing structural integrity to the cells. However, demonstrating this correlation between cytoskeleton organization and nuclear position requires the parameterization of the extraordinarily intricate cytoskeletal fiber arrangements. Here, we show that this parameterization and demonstration can be achieved outside the limits of human conceptualization, using generative network and raw microscope images, relying on machine-driven interpretation and selection of parameterizable features. The developed transformer-based architecture was able to generate high-quality, completed images of more than 8,000 cells, using only information on actin filaments, predicting the presence of a nucleus and its exact localization in more than 70 per cent of instances. Our results demonstrate one of the most basic principles of mechanobiology with a remarkable level of significance. They also highlight the role of deep learning as a powerful tool in biology beyond data augmentation and analysis, capable of interpreting-unconstrained by the principles of human reasoning-complex biological systems from qualitative data."
https://openalex.org/W4288705005,"Background The concept of home-based palliative care has been recently introduced in Bangladesh, but the patients’ quality of life remains unexplored. This study aimed to assess the quality of life and its determinants of the cancer patients receiving home-based palliative care in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 51 surviving cancer patients above 18 years registered under the home-based care service of the Department of Palliative Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data was collected by face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire based on the “Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative (FACIT-Pal)” questionnaire from February to March 2019. Descriptive analysis was done for the socio-demographic, disease and treatment related factors. Mann-Whiteney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and logistic regression were done to determine the relationships between independent variables and QoL. Result The majority of the patients (76.5%) were women. The mean age of the respondents was 56.2±4.8 years. Common primary sites of cancer were breast (39.2%), gastrointestinal (17.6%), and genitourinary system (23.5%). The median duration of getting home-based care was four months. The most prevalent problems were pain, sadness, feeling ill, and lack of satisfaction regarding sexual life. The majority (88.2%) of the patients had an average and above-average quality of life. Although, 92.1%patients had average or above-average social and emotional wellbeing, 60.8% had below-average physical wellbeing. Patients’ marital status, belief about disease prognosis, and duration of getting home-based care had a positive influence, and age negatively influenced the quality of life. Conclusion The majority of the patients receiving home-based palliative care in Dhaka city had average or above-average quality of life. However, these patients had better social and emotional wellbeing, but the physical wellbeing and symptom control were below-average according to the individual domain."
https://openalex.org/W4288710890,"To reorient food systems to ensure they deliver healthy diets that protect against multiple forms of malnutrition and diet-related disease and safeguard the environment, ecosystems, and natural resources, there is a need for better governance and accountability. However, decision-makers are often in the dark on how to navigate their food systems to achieve these multiple outcomes. Even where there is sufficient data to describe various elements, drivers, and outcomes of food systems, there is a lack of tools to assess how food systems are performing. This paper presents a diagnostic methodology for 39 indicators representing food supply, food environments, nutrition outcomes, and environmental outcomes that offer cutoffs to assess performance of national food systems. For each indicator, thresholds are presented for unlikely, potential, or likely challenge areas. This information can be used to generate actions and decisions on where and how to intervene in food systems to improve human and planetary health. A global assessment and two country case studies—Greece and Tanzania—illustrate how the diagnostics could spur decision options available to countries."
https://openalex.org/W4288713859,"The aim of this study was to establish the possible effect of age, corticosteroid treatment and brain dystrophin involvement on motor function in young boys affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy who were assessed using the North Star Ambulatory Assessment between the age of 4 and 7 years. The study includes 951 North Star assessments from 226 patients. Patients were subdivided according to age, to the site of mutation and therefore to the involvement of different brain dystrophin isoforms and to corticosteroids duration. There was a difference in the maximum North Star score achieved among patients with different brain dystrophin isoforms (p = 0.007). Patients with the involvement of Dp427, Dp140 and Dp71, had lower maximum NSAA scores when compared to those with involvement of Dp427 and Dp140 or of Dp427 only. The difference in the age when the maximum score was achieved in the different subgroups did not reach statistical significance. Using a linear regression model on all assessments we found that each of the three variables, age, site of mutation and corticosteroid treatment had an influence on the NSAA values and their progression over time. A second analysis, looking at 12-month changes showed that within this time interval the magnitude of changes was related to corticosteroid treatment but not to site of mutation. Our findings suggest that each of the considered variables appear to play a role in the progression of North Star scores in patients between the age of 4 and 7 years and that these should be carefully considered in the trial design of boys in this age range."
https://openalex.org/W4288714321,"This study aimed to evaluate relationships among maternal residual feed intake (RFI) with growth performance and expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in offspring of Nellore cattle. Fifty-three cows classified as negative or positive RFI by genomic prediction were exposed to fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocols at 2 and 3 years of age using semen from the same bull. In the first year, cows gestated under grazing conditions and nursed their calves in the feedlot. In the second year, the opposite occurred. Cows were weighed every 28 days during pregnancy and calves were weighed at birth and every 28 days until weaning. Ultrasound images were collected from the carcass of cows and calves. Muscle gene expression was evaluated in calves at birth and weaning. Data were analyzed by year considering the fixed effects of RFI class and FTAI protocol for variables measured in cows, and RFI class, FTAI protocol and sex for variables measured in calves. There was no effect of maternal RFI on calves performance in the first year. Lower expression of FABP4 gene and trend towards lower expression of SREBF1 and LPL genes were detected in samples collected after birth from calves born to negative RFI cows, indicating that adipogenesis was reduced during the fetal and neonatal period. In the second year, negative RFI cows had greater subcutaneous fat thickness than positive RFI cows, and their calves tended to be heavier at birth and to have less rump fat thickness at weaning. No significant differences in expression of genes studied were detected between cow RFI classes. Nellore cows classified as negative RFI consume less feed and produce calves whose growth potential is similar to that of calves produced by positive RFI cows."

In some sky cultures, constellations are represented as line (or connect-the-dot) figures, which are spatial networks drawn over the fixed background of stars. We analyse 1802 line figures from 56 sky cultures spanning all continents, in terms of their network, spatial, and brightness features, and ask what associations exist between these visual features and culture type or sky region. First, an embedded map of constellations is learnt, to show clusters of line figures. We then form the network of constellations (as linked by their similarity), to study how similar cultures are by computing their assortativity (or homophily) over the network. Finally, we measure the diversity (or entropy) index for the set of constellations drawn per sky region. Our results show distinct types of line figures, and that many folk astronomies with oral traditions have widespread similarities in constellation design, which do not align with cultural ancestry. In a minority of sky regions, certain line designs appear universal, but this is not the norm: in the majority of sky regions, the line geometries are diverse."
https://openalex.org/W4288431161,"Objectives Behavioural measures such as social distancing are crucial to prevent the spread of COVID-19. People sometimes have difficulty to comply with these behavioural measures for various reasons. Insight is needed into evidence-based strategies that can promote compliance. In the present study, we examined whether behaviour change techniques (volitional help sheet (VHS), behavioural journalism (BJ) and empathy inductions (EI)) could promote behavioural compliance with the COVID-19 measures. Methods Three online experiments were carried out (N = 424–593) among Dutch adult citizens, using a randomized 2-group post-test and 1-week follow-up design. In each experiment, a control group was compared with the experimental condition (respectively VHS, BJ or EI condition). Results Two out of the three different strategies did result in favourable changes with regard to the compliance-related measures. The VHS contributed to changes in perceived susceptibility of others (t = -2,78; f**2 = 0,019), perceived severity (t = -3,65; f**2 = 0,032) and individual behavioural compliance measures. People exposed to the VHS were more likely to receive less visitors (w = 16638; p = 0.003)and avoid crowds (w = 16631; p = 0.003). EI increased the perceived vulnerability of others. Video-based role model stories, based on BJ did not result in any changes. Conclusions Behaviour change strategies may contribute to promoting behavioural compliance and could be used in public health communication. The empathy induction can be used to enhance other protection motives, while the volitional help sheet effectively can help people to overcome compliance barriers. Behavioural science can add to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic."

Using 32 highly trained under (U) 12 to U14 soccer players (mean (SD) age 12.9 (0.9) years, body mass 46.4 (8.5) kg and stature 158.2 (14.9) cm) academy soccer players from two English professional male soccer academies. Players were categorised according to somatic maturity status using estimated percentage of adult stature attainment, with players randomly assigned into teams to play 4v4 SSG. The study used a repeated measures design, whereby the selected players participated within 6 bio-banded (maturity matched [pre-PHV Vs pre-PHV and post-PHV vs post PHV] and miss-matched [pre-PHV vs post-PHV] and 6 mixed maturity SSG at their respective clubs. Using mixed and fixed effect regression models, it was established hat pre-PHV players exhibited higher dRPE compared with their post-PHV counterparts. Mixed bio-banded games reported higher dRPE outputs overall. Variation in dRPE measures across a series of bio-banded games are caused by both between and within sources of variation in relatively equal amounts. Across a series of bio-banded games, the four dRPE measures do not provide unique information, and between variation is best expressed by one or two highly correlated components, with within variation best explained by a single equally loaded component. Using a bio-banding SSG design study, we have shown that pre-PHV players report higher subjective measures of exertion than post-PHV players during. Additionally, when evenly mixing players based on measures of maturation, higher measures of perceived exertion were generally reported."

For the future control of GBS-inflicted disease, GBS surface exposed proteins are particularly relevant as they may act as antigens for vaccine development and/or as serosubtype markers in epidemiological settings. Even so, the genes encoding some of the surface proteins established as serosubtype markers by antibody-based methods, like the R3 surface protein, are still unknown. Here, by examining a Norwegian GBS collection consisting of 140 strains, we find that R3 protein expression correlates with the presence of the gene sar5 . By inducible expression of sar5 in an R3-negative bacterial strain we show that the sar5 gene product is specifically recognized by an R3 monoclonal antibody. With this we identify sar5 as the gene encoding the R3 surface protein, a serosubtype marker of hitherto unknown genetic origin."

Method This cross-sectional study involved pre-doctoral dental students (years 2 to 4) who had a simulation and/or clinical experience working with dental faculty for at least one year. Students completed a self-administered questionnaire with three sections: demographic, difference between faculty related to their knowledge, skill, critical thinking, acceptance of cultural differences, and students’ preferences in working with faculty in specialty clinics. Results A total of 136 students completed the survey (75.4% response rate). Participants were 52.6% women, 62.2% self-identified as Caucasian/White. Students reported that female faculty are more understanding (p = 0.001) and accepting of cultural differences (p&lt;0.001) compared to male faculty (p&lt;0.05). Students reported perceiving female faculty more as being a role model than male faculty (p = 0.034). When comparing male and female students, male student’s perception of male faculty as a role model was significantly higher than female students (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in student’s perceptions between male and female faculty in their knowledge, skills, compassion, critical thinking, providing feedback, communication skills, and grading (p&gt;0.05).

However, all research, development and innovation activities depend on the financial resources made available, as specific financing accelerates the production and dissemination of the best ideas and practices, as well as their role in meeting the challenges our society deals with nowadays. Our study aims to identify the determining factors for the researcher’s participation and success rates in research funding competitions. The goal of the research is to understand how variables such as age, gender, main field, affiliation, and scientific rank can affect the access to funding opportunities available for research and innovation. The study relies on a questionnaire-based survey conducted with 243 early-career and senior researchers from many state universities across Romania. For an in-depth analysis of the factors that influence the success rate in research competitions, in the present approach, we used both graphical and econometric methods. A binary logistic regression modelling was performed in order to explain the relationships between variables. Among other considerations, our findings revealed that in all main research fields, scientific rank and gender are important features for raising the participation and success rate in research funding competitions."

Our objective was to assess whether interdisciplinary academic training and teamwork of authors publishing original research in 15 top-tier journals varied by year of publication (2000/2010/2020), type of journal (epidemiological/general clinical/specialty clinical), corresponding author gender, and time since the corresponding author completed formal training relative to the article publication date (&lt;5/≥5 years). Methods and findings We invited corresponding authors of original research articles to participate in an online survey (n = 103; response rate = 8.3% of 1240 invited authors). In bivariate analyses, year of publication, type of journal, gender, and recency of training were not significantly associated with interdisciplinary team composition, whether a co-author with epidemiological or biostatistical training was involved in any research stage (design/analysis/interpretation/reporting), or with participants’ confidence in their own or their co-authors epidemiological or biostatistical expertise (p &gt; 0.05 for each comparison). Exceptions were participants with more recent epidemiological training all had co-author(s) with epidemiological training contribute to study design and interpretation, and participants who published in 2020 were more likely to report being extremely confident in their epidemiological abilities. Conclusions This study was the first to quantify interdisciplinary training among research teams publishing in epidemiological and clinical journals. Our quantitative results show research published in top-tier journals generally represents interdisciplinary teamwork and that interdisciplinary training may provide publication type options. Our qualitative results show researchers view interdisciplinary training favorably."

However, the uptake of PrEP among individuals at high-risk of HIV acquisition in sub-Saharan Africa varies because of availability and acceptability. We assessed the acceptability of PrEP among participants in a prospective HIV vaccine preparedness study in Masaka, southwestern Uganda.From November 2018 to August 2019, 20 participants (10 female) were purposively selected for in-depth interviews (IDIs) at 3 and 9 months' post-enrolment in the vaccine preparedness study. Four focus group discussions (FGD) (two among men) were conducted with 29 individuals categorized as: younger (18-24 years) men, younger (18-24 years) women, older (≥30 years) men, and older (≥30 years) women. Apart from IDI specific questions on recent life history including work experience, relationship history and places lived, topics for IDIs and FGDs included knowledge of HIV, perceptions of HIV risk (including own risk), knowledge of and use of PrEP. The Theoretical Framework of Acceptability was used to structure a thematic framework approach for data analysis.Participants understood that PrEP was an oral pill taken daily by HIV negative individuals to prevent acquisition of HIV. Overall, interest in and acceptability of PrEP was high, more than half expressed positivity towards PrEP but were not ready to initiate taking it citing the burden of daily oral pill taking, related side effects, stigma and distrust of PrEP. Fourteen participants (from IDI and FGD) initiated PrEP, although some (one FGD and two IDI participants) stopped taking it due to side effects or perceived reduced risk.We observed a keen interest in PrEP initiation among our study participants. However, a limited understanding of PrEP and associated concerns impeded uptake and sustained use. Hence, interventions are needed to address end-user challenges to increase uptake and support adherence."
