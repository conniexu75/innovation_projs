https://openalex.org/W2089050775,"Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths despite the fact that detection of this cancer in early stages results in over 90% survival rate. Currently less than 45% of at-risk individuals in the US are screened regularly, exposing a need for better screening tests. We performed two case-control studies to validate a blood-based test that identifies methylated DNA in plasma from all stages of CRC. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a PCR assay for analysis of Septin 9 (SEPT9) hypermethylation in DNA extracted from plasma, clinical performance was optimized on 354 samples (252 CRC, 102 controls) and validated in a blinded, independent study of 309 samples (126 CRC, 183 controls). 168 polyps and 411 additional disease controls were also evaluated. Based on the training study SEPT9-based classification detected 120/252 CRCs (48%) and 7/102 controls (7%). In the test study 73/126 CRCs (58%) and 18/183 control samples (10%) were positive for SEPT9 validating the training set results. Inclusion of an additional measurement replicate increased the sensitivity of the assay in the testing set to 72% (90/125 CRCs detected) while maintaining 90% specificity (19/183 for controls). Positive rates for plasmas from the other cancers (11/96) and non-cancerous conditions (41/315) were low. The rate of polyp detection (>1 cm) was ∼20%. Conclusions/Significance Analysis of SEPT9 DNA methylation in plasma represents a straightforward, minimally invasive method to detect all stages of CRC with potential to satisfy unmet needs for increased compliance in the screening population. Further clinical testing is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2066691052,"RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene-I), a cytoplasmic RNA helicase, interacts with IPS-1/MAVS/Cardif/VISA, a protein on the outer membrane of mitochondria, to signal the presence of virus-derived RNA and induce type I interferon production. Activation of RIG-I requires the ubiquitin ligase, TRIM25, which mediates lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of the RIG-I N-terminal CARD-like region. However, how this modification proceeds for activation of IPS-1 by RIG-I remains unclear. Here we identify an alternative factor, Riplet/RNF135, that promotes RIG-I activation independent of TRIM25. The Riplet/RNF135 protein consists of an N-terminal RING finger domain, C-terminal SPRY and PRY motifs, and shows sequence similarity to TRIM25. Immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that the C-terminal helicase and repressor domains of RIG-I interact with the Riplet/RNF135 C-terminal region, whereas the CARD-like region of RIG-I is dispensable for this interaction. Riplet/RNF135 promotes lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of the C-terminal region of RIG-I, modification of which differs from the N-terminal ubiquitination by TRIM25. Overexpression and knockdown analyses revealed that Riplet/RNF135 promotes RIG-I-mediated interferon-β promoter activation and inhibits propagation of the negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus. Our data suggest that Riplet/RNF135 is a novel factor of the RIG-I pathway that is involved in the evoking of human innate immunity against RNA virus infection, and activates RIG-I through ubiquitination of its C-terminal region. We infer that a variety of RIG-I-ubiquitinating molecular complexes sustain RIG-I activation to modulate RNA virus replication in the cytoplasm."

However, studies that prospectively examined circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH] D) in relation to diabetes risk are limited. Our objective is to determine the association between maternal plasma 25-[OH] D concentrations in early pregnancy and the risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods A nested case-control study was conducted among a prospective cohort of 953 pregnant women. Among them, 57 incident GDM cases were ascertained and 114 women who were not diagnosed with GDM were selected as controls. Controls were frequency matched to cases for the estimated season of conception of the index pregnancy. Results Among women who developed GDM, maternal plasma 25-[OH] D concentrations at an average of 16 weeks of gestation were significantly lower than controls (24.2 vs. 30.1 ng/ml, P<0.001). This difference remained significant (3.62 ng/ml lower on average in GDM cases than controls (P value = 0.018)) after the adjustment for maternal age, race, family history of diabetes, and pre-pregnancy BMI. Approximately 33% of GDM cases, compared with 14% of controls (P<0.001), had maternal plasma 25-[OH] D concentrations consistent with a pre-specified diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml). After adjustment for the aforementioned covariates including BMI, vitamin D deficiency was associated with a 2.66-fold (OR (95% CI): 2.66 (1.01–7.02)) increased GDM risk. Moreover, each 5 ng/ml decrease in 25-[OH] D concentrations was related to a 1.29-fold increase in GDM risk (OR (95% CI): 1.29 (1.05–1.60)). Additional adjustment for season and physical activity did not change findings substantially. Conclusions Findings from the present study suggest that maternal vitamin D deficiency in early pregnancy is significantly associated with an elevated risk for GDM."
https://openalex.org/W2161600055,"Embryonic exposure to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin during gonadal sex determination promotes an epigenetic reprogramming of the male germ-line that is associated with transgenerational adult onset disease states. Further analysis of this transgenerational phenotype on the brain demonstrated reproducible changes in the brain transcriptome three generations (F3) removed from the exposure. The transgenerational alterations in the male and female brain transcriptomes were distinct. In the males, the expression of 92 genes in the hippocampus and 276 genes in the amygdala were transgenerationally altered. In the females, the expression of 1,301 genes in the hippocampus and 172 genes in the amygdala were transgenerationally altered. Analysis of specific gene sets demonstrated that several brain signaling pathways were influenced including those involved in axon guidance and long-term potentiation. An investigation of behavior demonstrated that the vinclozolin F3 generation males had a decrease in anxiety-like behavior, while the females had an increase in anxiety-like behavior. These observations demonstrate that an embryonic exposure to an environmental compound appears to promote a reprogramming of brain development that correlates with transgenerational sex-specific alterations in the brain transcriptomes and behavior. Observations are discussed in regards to environmental and transgenerational influences on the etiology of brain disease."
https://openalex.org/W2143442828,"Changes in cellular redox status are a well established response across phyla following pathogen challenge. In this context, the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) is a conspicuous feature of plants responding to attempted microbial infection and this redox-based regulator underpins the development of plant immunity. However, the associated molecular mechanism(s) have not been defined. Here we show that NO accretion during the nitrosative burst promotes increasing S-nitrosylation of the Arabidopsis thaliana salicylic acid-binding protein 3 (AtSABP3) at cysteine (Cys) 280, suppressing both binding of the immune activator, salicylic acid (SA), and the carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity of this protein. The CA function of AtSABP3 is required for the expression of resistance in the host against attempted pathogen infection. Therefore, inhibition of AtSBAP3 CA function by S-nitrosylation could contribute to a negative feedback loop that modulates the plant defense response. Thus, AtSABP3 is one of the first targets for S-nitrosylation in plants for which the biological function of this redox-based post-translational modification has been uncovered. These data provide a molecular connection between the changes in NO levels triggered by attempted pathogen infection and the expression of disease resistance."

In the present study mass spectrometric analyses of C-terminal domain of occludin identified Tyr-379 and Tyr-383 in chicken occludin as the phosphorylation sites, which are located in a highly conserved sequence of occludin, YETDYTT; Tyr-398 and Tyr-402 are the corresponding residues in human occludin. Deletion of YETDYTT motif abolished the c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of occludin and the regulation of ZO-1 binding. Y398A and Y402A mutations in human occludin also abolished the c-Src-mediated phosphorylation and regulation of ZO-1 binding. Y398D/Y402D mutation resulted in a dramatic reduction in ZO-1 binding even in the absence of c-Src. Similar to wild type occludin, its Y398A/Y402A mutant was localized at the plasma membrane and cell-cell contact sites in Rat-1 cells. However, Y398D/Y402D mutants of occludin failed to localize at the cell-cell contacts. Calcium-induced reassembly of Y398D/Y402D mutant occludin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was significantly delayed compared with that of wild type occludin or its T398A/T402A mutant. Furthermore, expression of Y398D/Y402D mutant of occludin sensitized MDCK cells for hydrogen peroxide-induced barrier disruption.

Occludin, claudins, and tricellulin are tetraspan proteins, and their extracellular domains interact with homotypic domains of the adjacent cells (1Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P.

Occludin, a ∼65-kDa protein, has been well characterized to be assembled into the TJs. Although occludin knock-out mice showed the formation of intact TJs in different epithelia (34Saitou M.

Cell. 2000; 11: 4131-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), numerous studies have emphasized that it plays an important role in the regulation of TJ integrity. Occludin spans the membrane four times to form two extracellular loops and one intracellular loop, and the N-terminal and C-terminal domains hang into the intracellular compartment (35Fujimoto K. J.

Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), whereas Tyr phosphorylation is undetectable. However, the disruption of TJs in Caco-2 cell monolayers by oxidative stress and acetaldehyde leads to Tyr phosphorylation of occludin; the tyrosine kinase inhibitors attenuate the disruption of TJs (39Rao R.K.

Furthermore, a previous in vitro study demonstrated that Tyr phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of occludin leads to the loss of its interaction with ZO-1 and ZO-3 (25Kale G. Naren A.P. Sheth P. Rao R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the present study we identified the Tyr residues in occludin that are phosphorylated by c-Src and determined their role in regulated interaction between occludin and ZO-1 and its assembly into the TJs. Results show that 1) Tyr-379 and Tyr-383 in chicken occludin and Tyr-398 and Tyr-402 in human occludin are the exclusive sites of phosphorylation by c-Src, and these Tyr residues are located in a highly conserved sequence of occludin, YET-DYTT, 2) deletion of YEDTYTT or point mutation of Tyr-398 and Tyr-402 in human occludin attenuates the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of ZO-1 binding, 3) Y398D/Y402D mutation of human occludin leads to loss of ZO-1 binding and prevents its translocation to the plasma membrane and cell-cell contact sites in Rat-1 cells, 4) Y398D/Y402D mutation of occludin delays its assembly into the intercellular junctions during the calcium-induced assembly of TJs, and 5) expression of Y398D/Y402D mutant occludin sensitizes cell monolayers for hydrogen peroxide-induced disruption of barrier function. Cell culture reagents and supplies, G418, Lipofectamine-R, and Plus reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. FuGENE was purchased from Roche Diagnostics, and glutathione (GSH), leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, GSH-agarose, Triton X-100, and vanadate were purchased from Sigma. The QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. Active c-Src (recombinant protein) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased either from Sigma or Fisher. cDNA for the C-terminal tail of chicken occludin (amino acids 358–504) was a kind gift from Dr. James Anderson (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC); this was used to amplify and insert into pGEX2T vector. The C-terminal tail of human occludin 378–522 was amplified from a full-length human occludin in pEGFP and then shuttled into pGEX2T vector. Site directed mutations were induced in both chicken and human occludin (C-terminal domain as well as full-length occludin). The sequences of the primers used for this are provided in Table 1. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. pGEX2T constructs containing wild type occludin C-terminal domain (GST-cOcl-C and GST-hOcl-C) were transformed into BL21DE3 cells, and recombinant proteins were purified.

The digest was passed through 0.45-μm filters. Clear supernatant was lyophilized to dryness. Air-dried samples were equilibrated in an aqueous solution containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and desalted by passing through C-18 ZipTip (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using the manufacturer's protocol. Peptides extracted from the ZipTip were subjected to phosphopeptide extraction. Extraction of Phosphopeptides—The phosphopeptides from trypsin digestion of Tyr-phosphorylated GST-cOcl-C were isolated using a phosphopeptide isolation kit (Pierce). Phosphopeptides were bound to immobilized gallium matrix at acidic pH (<3.5) and eluted in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at pH 10. Phosphopeptide extracts were then subjected to MALDI and LC/MS/MS analysis. MALDI-TOF—Phosphopeptide extracts were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 2 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) and spotted for crystallization. Crystals were analyzed for mass by MALDI-TOF using Voyager Biospectrometry work station DE (delayed extraction technology) (Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) and Data Explorer (Perseptive Biosystems). A Prescriptive Biosystems MALDI time-of-flight instrument incorporating a nitrogen laser (Laser Science, Newton, MA) was used to obtain MALDI mass spectra. Samples solubilized in 85% acetic acid and mixed (1:3 v/v) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix were spotted in 1-μl aliquots and air-dried. Typically, 100–250 laser shots were used to obtain one mass spectrum. Mass scale was calibrated with peptide internal standards. LC/MS/MS Analysis—Sequence analysis of tryptic peptides was performed by injecting 3 μl of the ZipTip-purified sample onto a capillary C-18 LC column on-line with a Finnigan LCQDECA (Thermoquest, San Jose, CA) ion-trap mass analyzer that is equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source. The capillary C-18 column was prepared in-house using New Objective Pico Frit (360-μm outer diameter, 75-μm inner diameter, 15-μm tip, 10.4-cm length) and Magic C18AQ packing material (5-μm beads, 200 A° pores). The peptides were fractionated using 0.1% formic acid in water as solvent A and 90% acetonitrile as solvent B. The acquired spectra were visualized using Qual-browser in the X-Calibur software suite. Raw data thus obtained was analyzed against a protein data base generated from Swissprot using the Sequest software suite (Sequest Technologies Inc., Lisle, IL). Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-ZO-1, rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1, and rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-3 were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was from BD Transduction Laboratories. HRP-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-GST antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Caco-2, Rat-1, and MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium from Invitrogen and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm glutamine as per the ATCC guidelines. MDCK cells were seeded on 6-well plates a day before transfection to achieve 50–60% confluency. The cells were transfected using 1 ml of antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μg of DNA plasmid (empty vector pEGFP or vector carrying hOclWT or its mutants), 1 μl of Plus reagent, and 3 μl of Lipofectamine-R for each well. After 20 h, the cell monolayers were trypsinized and seeded onto 100-mm plates. The cells were subjected to G418 selection (0.7 mg/ml) for 2 weeks. Resistant cells were sorted to obtain only GFP-expressing cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Cells were maintained in the medium that was supplemented with 0.3 mg/ml G418. Rat-1 cells were transfected using FuGENE reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol, and the GFP-positive cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Stably transfected cells were selected using G418 as described above. Cell monolayers (12-mm transwells) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in acetone-methanol (1:1) at 0 °C for 5 min. Cell monolayers were blocked in 3% nonfat milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP) followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG). The fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss LSM 5 laser scanning confocal microscope, and images from Z-series sections (1 μm) were collected by using Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal Confocal Microscopy Software (Release 3.2). Images were stacked using the software, Image J (NIH), and processed by Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Recombinant GST-cOcl-CWT or GST-hOcl-CWT (5 μg) was incubated with 500 ng of active c-Src in 250 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm MgCl2) containing 100 μm ATP at 30 °C for 3 h on a shaking incubator. Control reactions were done in the absence of ATP. To determine the interaction of occludin with ZO-1 and ZO-3, GST-hOcl-C GST-cOcl-C (2.5–10 μg) was incubated with Caco-2 whole cell extract made in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride for 16 h at 4 °C on an inverter. GST-occludin-C (GST-conjugated C-terminal tail of occludin) was pulled down with 20 μl of 50% GSH-agarose slurry at 4 °C for 1 h. The amounts of ZO-1 and ZO-3 bound to GSH-agarose were determined by immunoblot analysis. Nonspecific binding was determined by carrying out the binding with GST. Proteins were separated by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blotted for ZO-1, ZO-3, and p-Tyr by using specific antibodies in combination with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. HRP-conjugated anti-GST antibody was used for immunoblot analysis of GST or GST-occludin. The blot was developed using ECL chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed by densitometric analysis of specific bands on immunoblots by using the software, Image J. MDCK cell monolayers that stably express GFP-hOclWT, GFP-hOclY398A/Y402A, or GFP-hOclY398D/Y402D were exposed to varying concentrations (20–2500 μm) of hydrogen peroxide for 2 h, and paracellular permeability was evaluated by measuring the unidirectional flux of inulin as described before (11Basuroy S. Sheth P. Kuppuswamy D. Balasubramanian S. Ray R.M. Rao R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11916-11924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). MDCK cell monolayers that stably express GFP-hOclWT, GFP-hOclY398A/Y402A, or GFP-hOclY398D/Y402D were incubated overnight with low calcium medium followed by calcium replacement as described before (29Seth A. Sheth P. Elias B.C. Rao R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11487-11498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). TJ assembly was evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance, inulin permeability, and confocal microscopy. GFP was immunoprecipitated from cells under native or denatured conditions as described before (29Seth A. Sheth P. Elias B.C. Rao R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11487-11498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Anti-GFP immunocomplexes at native conditions were immunoblotted for ZO-1, whereas complexes under denatured conditions were immunoblotted for p-Tyr. Comparison between two groups was made by Student's t tests for grouped data. Significance in all tests was set at 95% or greater confidence level. Tyr-379 and Tyr-383 in Chicken Occludin Are the Sites of Phosphorylation by c-Src—A previous study showed that Tyr phosphorylation of occludin C-terminal domain by c-Src resulted in the loss of its interaction with ZO-1 (25Kale G. Naren A.P. Sheth P. Rao R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the present study we identified the phosphorylation sites in occludin C-terminal domain by mass spectrometric analysis. GST-fused C-terminal region (150 amino acids) of chicken occludin (GST-cOcl) was prepared and phosphorylated by incubation with c-Src and ATP. Tyr-phosphorylated GST-cOcl-C was digested with trypsin. Generation of five different tryptic peptides containing Tyr residues was predicted (Fig. 1A); the mass of these peptides was expected to increase by 80 Da with phosphorylation of each Tyr residue. MALDI mass spectrometric analysis of the phosphopeptide extracts from the tryptic digest detected several phosphopeptides with masses slightly deviated from the predicted mass analysis (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows the ion fragmentation spectrum from LC/MS/MS analysis of the phosphopeptide with a mass of 2918 Da. The sequences of peptides as determined by LC/MS/MS analyses of the phosphopeptide extract are summarized in Fig. 1D. Three different Tyr-phosphorylated peptides were identified. All three peptides were identified as the derivatives of tryptic peptide, P1 with single or double phosphorylation of Tyr residues. These results determine that two Tyr residues in occludin C-terminal region corresponding to the sequence of P1 were singly or doubly phosphorylated. These two Tyr residues correspond to Tyr-379 and Tyr-383 in chicken occludin. Sequence alignment of occludin from different species (Fig. 2A) demonstrated that Tyr-379 and Tyr-383 are located in a highly conserved sequence of occludin (YETDYTT) and that Tyr-398 and Tyr-402 are the corresponding Tyr residues in human occludin. Therefore, we induced mutations in chicken and human occludin C-terminal region (cOcl-C and hOcl-C). The YETDYTT was deleted or the tyrosine residues in this region were subjected to point mutation in cOcl-C and hOcl-C (Fig. 2B) and inserted into pGEX2T vector to generate GST-fused mutant proteins. Tyr-398 and Tyr-402 in full-length human occludin in pEGFP vector were mutated to phenylalanine or aspartic acid and expressed in Rat-1 or MDCK cells as GFP fusion proteins. Deletion of YEDYTT in Chicken Occludin C-terminal Region Prevents Phosphorylation and Attenuates Regulation of ZO-1 Binding—The ability of GST-cOcl-C or GST-cOcl-C(Δ378–385) to bind ZO-1 was evaluated by GST pulldown assay. Both GST-cOcl-CandGST-cOcl(Δ378–385)showeddose-dependent binding to ZO-1 and ZO-3 (Fig. 3A). However, ZO-1 binding to GST-cOcl(Δ378–385) was low at higher doses compared with the ZO-1 binding to GST-cOcl-C under similar conditions (Fig. 3B). Incubation with c-Src in the presence of ATP induced Tyr phosphorylation of GST-cOcl-C, whereas no phosphorylation was detected in GST-cOcl(Δ378–385) (Fig. 3C). Incubation of GST-cOcl-C with c-Src in the presence of ATP significantly reduced ZO-1 binding (Fig. 3, C and D), whereas ZO-1 binding was similar for GST-cOcl(Δ378–385) that was incubated with c-Src in the presence or absence of ATP. Y379F and Y383F Mutation of Chicken Occludin Attenuates Its Phosphorylation and Regulation of ZO-1 Binding— GST pulldown assay for ZO-1 binding showed that GST-cOcl-CWT, GST-cOcl-CY379F, GST-cOcl-CY383F, and GST-cOcl-CY379F/Y383F bind ZO-1 and ZO-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Incubation with c-Src in the presence of ATP showed a partial phosphorylation of single mutants, GST-cOcl-CY379F and GST-cOcl-CY383F, whereas phosphorylation was undetectable in the double mutant, GST-cOcl-CY379F/Y383F (Fig. 4B). ZO-1 binding was not significantly different among unphosphorylated occludin (Fig. 4, B and C), except that ZO-1 binding of GST-cOcl-CY379F was slightly greater than that of GST-cOcl-CWT. Incubation in the presence of ATP and c-Src resulted in a reduced ZO-1 binding by GST-cOcl-CWT and GST-cOcl-CY379F (Fig. 4, B and C). However, incubation with c-Src in the presence of ATP did not alter the ZO-1 binding by GST-cOcl-CY383F and GST-cOcl-CY379F/Y383F (Fig. 4, B and C). Y379D and Y383D Mutation in Chicken Occludin Attenuates Its Binding to ZO-1—GST pulldown assay showed a dose-dependent binding of GST-cOcl-CWT, GST-cOcl-CY379D, GST-cOcl-CY383D, and GST-cOcl-CY379/383D to ZO-1 and ZO-3 (Fig. 5A). However, the ZO-1 binding to GST-cOcl-CY379D, GST-cOcl-CY383D, and GST-cOcl-CY379/383D was significantly low as compared with - ZO-1 binding to GST-cOcl-CWT (Fig. 5A). ZO-3 binding to GST-cOcl-CY383D and GST-cOcl-CY379/383D were significantly low compared with ZO-3 binding to GST-cOcl-CWT, whereas ZO-3 binding to GST-cOcl-CY379D was significantly greater. c-Src-induced Tyr-phosphorylation of GST-cOcl-CY379D and GST-cOcl-CY383D was low compared with Tyr phosphorylation of GST-cOclWT, and the Tyr-phosphorylation was absent in GST-cOcl-CY379"
https://openalex.org/W2025251808,"eIF2α is part of a multimeric complex that regulates cap-dependent translation. Phosphorylation of eIF2α (phospho-eIF2α) is induced by various forms of cell stress, resulting in changes to the proteome of the cell with two diametrically opposed consequences, adaptation to stress or initiation of programmed cell death. In contrast to the robust eIF2α phosphorylation seen in response to acute insults, less is known about the functional role of basal levels of eIF2α phosphorylation. Here we show that mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing a nonphosphorylatable eIF2α have enhanced sensitivity to diverse toxic insults, including amyloid β-(1–42) peptide (Aβ), a key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. This correlates with impaired glutathione metabolism because of down-regulation of the light chain, xCT, of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system X-c. The mechanistic link between the absence of phospho-eIF2α and xCT expression is nuclear factor ATF4. Consistent with these findings, long term activation of the phospho-eIF2α/ATF4/xCT signaling module by the specific eIF2α phosphatase inhibitor, salubrinal, induces resistance against oxidative glutamate toxicity in the hippocampal cell line HT22 and primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, in PC12 cells selected for resistance against Aβ, increased activity of the phospho-eIF2α/ATF4/xCT module contributes to the resistant phenotype. In wild-type PC12 cells, activation of this module by salubrinal ameliorates the response to Aβ. Furthermore, in human brains, ATF4 and phospho-eIF2α levels are tightly correlated and up-regulated in Alzheimer disease, most probably representing an adaptive response against disease-related cellular stress rather than a correlate of neurodegeneration. eIF2α is part of a multimeric complex that regulates cap-dependent translation.

Furthermore, in human brains, ATF4 and phospho-eIF2α levels are tightly correlated and up-regulated in Alzheimer disease, most probably representing an adaptive response against disease-related cellular stress rather than a correlate of neurodegeneration. eIF2α is part of the multimeric eIF2 complex that is involved in the initiation of cap-dependent protein translation (for reviews see Refs. 1Wek R.C. Jiang H.-Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 2Proud C.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The eIF2 complex brings the 40 S ribosomal subunit together with the initiating tRNAMet when eIF2 is bound to GTP. Upon hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, the complex is no longer active, and protein synthesis is not initiated. GDP/GTP exchange requires the activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. However, when eIF2α is phosphorylated on Ser-51 (phospho-eIF2α), the affinity of eIF2α for eIF2B increases, and thus it can sequester eIF2B, thereby inhibiting GDP/GTP exchange. As cells have considerably higher amounts of eIF2α compared with eIF2B, even modest increases in phospho-eIF2α can modulate eIF2B reactivation. Although these changes slow down cap-dependent initiation, they favor cap-independent translation. Proteins up-regulated by this mechanism include transcription factors such as activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4). Therefore, eIF2α phosphorylation orchestrates significant changes in the proteome of the cell. There are four known eIF2α kinases as follows: protein kinase R, heme-regulated eIF2α kinase, protein kinase R-like kinase (PERK), and GCN2 (general control nonderepressible-2) (for reviews see Refs. 1Wek R.C. Jiang H.-Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 2Proud C.G. Semin. Cell Dev.

Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), all of which are activated by distinct forms of stress. In addition, two different phosphatase complexes have been described that can mediate eIF2α dephosphorylation (4Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In general, the changes to the proteome induced by changes in eIF2α phosphorylation lead to adaptation of the cell to stress with two possible, diametrically opposed consequences, survival or initiation of programmed cell death. The outcome seems to be determined by the duration of the insults, the interplay of different branches of the stress response, and their time courses (5Lin J.H. Li H. Yasumura D. Cohen H.R. Zhang C. Panning B. Shokat K.M. Lavail M.M. Walter P. Science. 2007; 318: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). In addition to a response to cellular stress, basal levels of phospho-eIF2α are present in vitro (6Scheuner D. Van der Mierde D. Song B. Flamez D. Creemers J.W. Tsukamoto K. Ribick M. Schuit F.C. Kaufman R.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and in vivo (7Gietzen D.W. Ross C.M. Hao S. Sharp J.W. J.

Boye E. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), glucose homeostasis (10Scheuner D. Song B. McEwan E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S.

Cell. 2007; 129: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). There is good evidence that eIF2α phosphorylation can modulate the resistance of nerve cells to oxidative stress. For example, in early work from our laboratory (12Tan S. Somia N. Maher P. Schubert P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), infection of the HT22 nerve cell line with a construct expressing the S51D mutant of eIF2α, which acts as a constitutively phosphorylated form of the protein, was shown to bring about an increase in the resistance of the cells to oxidative stress, which correlated with an ability to maintain a high GSH concentration in the presence of oxidative stress. Further studies from the David Ron laboratory using a different approach to generate constitutively phosphorylated eIF2α in the HT22 cells confirmed these results (13Lu P.D. Jousse C. Marciniak S.J. Zhang Y. Novoa I. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ron D. Harding H.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). GSH and GSH-associated metabolism provide the major line of defense for the protection of cells from oxidative and other forms of stress (14Maher P. Ageing Res. Rev. 2005; 4: 288-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In addition, the GSSG/GSH redox pair forms the major redox couple in cells and as such plays a critical role in regulating redox-dependent cellular functions. GSH is a tripeptide containing the amino acids cysteine, glutamate, and glycine. Because glutamate and glycine occur at relatively high intracellular concentrations, cysteine is limiting for GSH synthesis in many types of cells. In the extracellular environment, cysteine is readily oxidized to form cystine, so for most cell types cystine transport mechanisms are essential to provide them with the cysteine needed for GSH synthesis. Cystine uptake in many types of cells is mediated by the Na+-independent cystine/glutamate antiporter, system X-c. System X-c is a member of the disulfide-linked heterodimeric amino acid transporter family and consists of a light chain (xCT) that confers substrate specificity and a heavy chain (4F2hc) that is shared among a number of different amino acid transporters (15Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). It transports cystine into cells in a 1/1 exchange with glutamate and is thus inhibited by high concentrations of extracellular glutamate (16Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2256-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of system X-c for the maintenance of GSH levels in cells is demonstrated by the loss of GSH and subsequent cell death seen in neural cells following exposure to millimolar concentrations of extracellular glutamate, a pathway termed oxidative glutamate toxicity or oxytosis (17Tan S. Schubert D. Maher P. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). System X-c is expressed in the brain (18Baker D.A. McFarland K. Lake R.W. Shen H. Tang X.-C.

In this study we investigate further the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in regulating GSH metabolism and the response of cells to oxidative stress. Using multiple, distinct cell lines, we show a tight linkage between eIF2α phosphorylation, ATF4, and system X-c expression. We further show that the phospho-eIF2α/ATF4 module is activated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). 3The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid β; UTR, untranslated region; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; siRNA, short interfering RNA; BCNU, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HCA, homocysteic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; AARE, amino acid-response element; tBHQ, tert-butylhydroquinone.3The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid β; UTR, untranslated region; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; siRNA, short interfering RNA; BCNU, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HCA, homocysteic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; AARE, amino acid-response element; tBHQ, tert-butylhydroquinone.

Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For viability assays, 1 × 104 MEFs, 2.5 × 103 HT22, or 2 × 103 PC12 cells were plated in 96-well plates, in some cases with 30 μm salubrinal (Axxora, San Diego) dissolved in DMSO or DMSO alone. After 24 h of culture, the medium was exchanged with fresh medium and the indicated concentrations of compounds. Sodium glutamate, homocysteic acid, SIN-1, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea (BCNU), ethacrynic acid, and tert-butylhydroperoxide were from Sigma. Amyloid β-(1–42) peptide (Aβ-(1–42)) was obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA). MEFs and HT22 cells were treated for 24 h and PC12 cells for 48 h. Viability or toxicity of Aβ was measured by the MTT assay as described previously (32Lewerenz J. Letz J. Methner A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mouse cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (33Schubert D. Piasecki D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7455-7462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well onto poly-l-lysine- and laminin-coated 96-well plates using high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum with 30 μm salubrinal dissolved in DMSO or DMSO alone. After 24 h, glutamate was added at the indicated concentrations. Survival was measured by the MTT assay after another 24 h. Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—For transfection, 5 × 104 S/S and 2 × 106 A/A MEFs were plated in 60-mm dishes and grown for 48 h. Because the two cell lines proliferate at different rates, these conditions yield similar cell densities at the end of the experiment. Transfection was performed with 2 μg of p-SV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega, Madison, WI), 2 μg of xCT promoter luciferase constructs (generous gifts from Dr. Hideyo Sato, Yamagata University, Tsuruoka, Japan), and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 2.5 ml of fresh DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum for 6 h. For some experiments, the transfection additionally included 40 pmol of ATF4 siRNA (catalog number sc-35113) or control siRNA (catalog number sc-37007), both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For overexpression of ATF4, some experiments additionally included 2 μg of empty pRK7 vector (a generous gift form Dr. Robert C. Cumming, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada) or a pRK7 vector expressing ATF4. This construct was obtained by excising the ATF4 open reading frame from a pcDNA3-hCD2 plasmid containing ATF4 (a generous gift from Dr. David Ron, Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY) and re-ligating into pRK7. To measure the translational activity of the ATF4 5′UTR, luciferase reporter promoter constructs were replaced by a vector containing the ATF4 5′-untranslated region (5′UTR) and AUG fused to luciferase by the TK promoter in a pGL3 backbone (a generous gift from David Ron). 24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and enzyme activities were measured by luminescence using the Beta Glo and Luciferase Assay Systems (Promega) on a luminometer from Molecular Devices (Madison, WI). The luciferase/β-galactosidase ratio for each condition and cell line was normalized to the ratio obtained by transfection of pGL3 and pSV-β-Gal for the same condition and cell line. HT22 cells were plated at a density of 4.4 × 105 cells/100-mm dish and grown for 24 h. The medium was exchanged with 5 ml of fresh growth medium, and the cells were transfected with 4 μg of pRK7 or pRK7-ATF4 vector using 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 for 6 h. 24 h later, the cells were re-plated for the different assays performed in parallel as follows: 8.8 × 105 in 100-mm dishes for protein preparation; 1.65 × 105 in 60-mm dishes for GSH measurement; 3 × 104/well in 24-well plates for [35S]cystine uptake; and 2.5 × 103/well in 96-well plates for oxidative glutamate toxicity, respectively. Cells were harvested or glutamate was added 24 h after re-plating. Enzymatic Measurement of Total GSH—For measurement of GSH, 5 × 105 A/A and S/S MEFs, 1.65 × 105 HT22 cells or 4.5 × 105 PC12 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes. MEFs and HT22 cells with or without salubrinal were grown for 24 h and PC12 cells for 48 h. Cells were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 10% sulfosalicylic acid was added to a final concentration of 3.3%. GSH was assayed as described (34Maher P. Lewerenz J. Lozano C. Torres J.L. J. Neurochem. 2008; 107: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and normalized to protein recovered from the acid-precipitated pellet by treatment with 0.2 n NaOH at 37 °C overnight and measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Measurement of System X -c Activity and of Other Amino Acid Uptake Systems—6 × 105 A/A and S/S MEF in parallel, 3 × 105 HT22, or PC12 cells with or without 30 μm salubrinal were plated in 24-well dishes and grown for 24, 24, and 48 h, respectively. For PC12 cells, the plates were coated with poly-l-lysine. Cells were washed three times with sodium-free HBSS. Uptake was performed in triplicate with 25 μm [35S]cystine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min at 37 °C. To specifically measure system X-c activity, 10 mm glutamate was added to parallel wells in triplicate. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold, sodium-free HBSS and lysed in 0.2 n NaOH. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting and normalized to protein measured by the Bradford method (Pierce). Because [35S]cystine became unavailable during the course of the experiments, system X-c activity in HT22 cells treated with salubrinal was measured as sodium-insensitive, HCA-inhibitable uptake of [3H]glutamate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells in triplicate were incubated in 10 μm glutamate ([3H]glutamate/cold glutamate 1/1000) with or without 1 mm HCA adjusted to pH 7.4 in sodium-free HBSS. To measure cysteine uptake, [35S]cystine was preincubated with 10 μm cysteamine, and uptake was performed similarly as for system X-c but with sodium-containing HBSS. This results in glutamate-insensitive, cysteine-sensitive uptake of radioactivity reflecting the function of system ASC and others (34Maher P. Lewerenz J. Lozano C. Torres J.L. J. Neurochem. 2008; 107: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To measure system L activity, 1 μm [3H]leucine was used in sodium-containing HBSS. Protein Preparation—For Western blotting, confluent A/A or S/S MEFs in 100-mm dishes, 3.3 × 105 HT22 cells per 60-mm dish grown for 24 h, or 1.2 × 106 wild-type PC12 cells and 6 × 105 PC12r7 cells per 100-mm dish grown for 48 h were used. For whole cell extracts, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1× protease inhibitor, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Cells were sonicated on ice and centrifuged. Cystosolic, membrane, and nuclear fractions were prepared as described previously (35Cordey M. Pike C.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein in the different fractions was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) and adjusted to equal concentrations. 5× Western blot sample buffer (74 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6.25% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) was added to a final concentration of 2.5×, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Samples of midfrontal cortex from individuals with histologically confirmed Alzheimer disease and age-matched control brains were obtained from Dr. Carol Miller at the Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Los Angeles, CA, and were described in detail previously (29Soucek T. Cumming R. Dargusch R. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 2003; 39: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 30Cumming R.C. Dargusch R. Fischer W.H. Schubert D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30523-30534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Frozen tissue samples were partially thawed, minced in 5× weight/volume extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, and protein inhibitor mixture), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged. Protein concentrations were determined using the Lowry assay (Pierce). Samples were boiled in 1× Western blot sample buffer. Western Blotting—For SDS-PAGE, similar amounts of cellular protein, typically 40 μg per lane were used. In experiments using human brain extracts, 40 μg per lane was loaded for detection of phospho-eIF2α and ATF4 and 20 μg/lane for detection of pan-eIF2α and actin. All samples were separated using 10% Criterion XT Precast BisTris gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the quality of protein measurement, electrophoresis, and transfer was checked by staining with Ponceau S. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the primary antibody diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20. The primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-phospho-Ser-51-eIF2α (catalog number 9721, 1/1000) and rabbit anti-eIF2α (catalog number 9722, 1/500) from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); rabbit anti-ATF4 (catalog number sc-200, 1/500) and rabbit anti-Nrf2, (catalog number sc-13032, 1/500) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; mouse anti-actin (catalog number A5441, 1/200,000) from Sigma; and rabbit anti-xCT (1/1000, a generous gift from Dr. Sylvia Smith, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA). Subsequently, blots were washed in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in horse-radish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse (Bio-Rad) diluted 1/5000 in 5% skim milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. After additional washing, protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using the Super Signal West Pico substrate (Pierce). For relative eIF2α phosphorylation, parallel blots were performed. For all other antibodies, the same membrane was re-probed for actin. Ponceau S-stained membranes and autoradiographs were scanned using a Bio-Rad GS800 scanner. Band density was measured using the manufacturer's software. Relative eIF2α phosphorylation was calculated as the ratio of band densities obtained by the phospho- and the pan-eIF2α antibody. Relative expression of the other proteins was normalized to actin band density, with the exception of the comparison of wild-type and resistant PC12 cells that express highly different amounts of nonmembrane-associated actin (30Cumming R.C. Dargusch R. Fischer W.H. Schubert D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30523-30534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that sediments with the nuclear fraction using our technique. Here relative expression was normalized to histone band density obtained by scanning the Ponceau S-stained membranes. Each Western blot was repeated at least three times with independent protein samples. ATF4 Promoter Analysis—Genomic sequence comparison was done using the NCBI genome data base and the reference sequence and the BLASTn algorithm (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The reference sequences for the different genomic sequences are NT 039229.7/Mm3 39269 37 for murine chromosome 3, NW 047625.2/Rn2 WGA21474 for rat chromosome 2, NT 016354.18/Hs4 16510 for human chromosome 4, and NW 001493490.2/Bt17 WGA16084 for bovine chromosome 17. Statistical Analysis—Data from at least three independent experiments were normalized, pooled, and analyzed using Graph Pad Prism 4 software followed by appropriate statistical tests. For exclusion of outliers, the established definition of an extreme outlier was used as follows: values lower or higher than the 25% percentile (Q1) or 75% percentile (Q3) minus or plus three times the interquartile range (Q3–Q1), respectively. In our earlier study on eIF2α and GSH metabolism (12Tan S. Somia N. Maher P. Schubert P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we showed that nerve cells engineered to express decreased levels of eIF2α were much less sensitive than wild-type cells to oxidative glutamate toxicity. This decrease in sensitivity to glutamate correlated with an increase in the levels of GSH that the cells were able to maintain in the presence of glutamate. Similar results were obtained following overexpression of a constitutively phosphorylated form of eIF2α (13Lu P.D. Jousse C. Marciniak S.J. Zhang Y. Novoa I. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ron D. Harding H.P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To explore further the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in modulating the response of cells to toxic stress, we utilized MEFs derived from mice homozygously expressing a nonphosphorylatable form of eIF2α (A/A MEFs) and compared them with wild-type fibroblasts (S/S MEFs) (10Scheuner D. Song B. McEwan E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). When S/S and A/A MEFs were subjected to oxidative glutamate toxicity by exposure to increasing concentrations of glutamate and cell survival assessed after 24 h by the MTT assay, we observed a striking difference in sensitivity between the two cell lines (Fig. 1A). Whereas S/S MEFs were relatively resistant to glutamate treatment with an EC50 of ∼7.5 mm for cell death, A/A MEFs showed a significant enhancement of sensitivity with an EC50 of ∼1 mm (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained following treatment with HCA, another system X-c inhibitor (Fig. 1B). Of note, the sensitivity of both cell lines against inhibition of GSH synthesis by the glutamate cysteine ligase inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine (36Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was similar (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, A/A MEFs were significantly more sensitive to a variety of other insults that decrease GSH levels in cells, including the peroxynitrite generator SIN-1 (37Burdo J. Schubert D. Maher P. Brain Res. 2008; 1189: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), BCNU (38Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol.

Treatment with trastuzumab (a monoclonal antibody against erbB2) improves survival; however, it also causes cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that blockade of the erbB2 receptor induces cardiomyocyte death through a mitochondrial pathway that is dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We first showed that levels of erbB2 receptor are significantly decreased in an animal model of ischemic heart disease and in human ischemic cardiomyopathy. We treated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with an inhibitory erbB2 antibody to study the mechanism behind the deleterious effects of erbB2 blockade. These cells displayed a dose-dependent increase in ROS production and cell death compared with control IgG-treated cells; these processes were reversed by the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine. The effects of erbB2 antibody on both cell death and ROS production were also reversed by cyclosporine A and diazoxide, chemicals that regulate the pro- and anti-apoptotic channels in the mitochondria, respectively. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Bax and Bak (proteins that mediate cell death through a mitochondrial pathway) were resistant to the deleterious effects of erbB2 antibody. These effects of erbB2 blockade appear to occur through a pathway involving AKT and PKC-α. Our results suggest that erbB2 plays a role in cardiomyocyte survival, and that the deleterious effects of trastuzumab on the heart occur through a mitochondrial pathway and is mediated by ROS production.

Manipulation of redox signaling may be beneficial in cancer patients receiving trastuzumab. The Her-2/neu oncogene, also known as erbB2 in nonhuman organisms, is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor family (1Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors.. 1994; 11: 235-257Google Scholar, 2Lemke G. Mol. Cell Neurosci.. 1996; 7: 247-262Google Scholar). Overexpression of Her2 is seen in ∼30% of breast cancer patients and is associated with poor survival, increased metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy (3Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G.

Trastuzumab is clinically efficacious both as a single agent or in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens (4Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J.

However, this agent is cardiotoxic on its own, and especially when administered with anthracyclines, where it can cause cardiomyopathy (CM) in up to 27% of patients (8Keefe D.L. Cancer.. 2002; 95: 1592-1600Google Scholar). The importance of erbB2 in normal cardiac development and physiology was demonstrated in mice by cardiac-specific knock-out of erbB2 (9Crone S.A. Zhao Y.Y. Fan L. Gu Y. Minamisawa S. Liu Y. Peterson K.L. Chen J. Kahn R. Condorelli G. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Lee K.F. Nat. Med.. 2002; 8: 459-465Google Scholar, 10Ozcelik C. Erdmann B. Pilz B.

The mice were initially normal, but developed CM as adults. One study demonstrated no difference between the wild-type and knock-out mice in the degree of cardiac cell death as assessed by TUNEL staining (10Ozcelik C. Erdmann B. Pilz B. Wettschureck N. Britsch S. Hubner N. Chien K.R. Birchmeier C. Garratt A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 8880-8885Google Scholar). However, in another study that used a more sensitive PCR-based DNA fragmentation assay increased DNA fragmentation was reported in the hearts of erbB2-knock-out animals (9Crone S.A. Zhao Y.Y. Fan L. Gu Y. Minamisawa S. Liu Y. Peterson K.L. Chen J. Kahn R. Condorelli G. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Lee K.F. Nat. Med.. 2002; 8: 459-465Google Scholar). Recently, Grazette et al. (11Grazette L.P. Boecker W. Matsui T. Semigran M. Force T.L. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. J. Am. Coll Cardiol.. 2004; 44: 2231-2238Google Scholar) studied the effects of erbB2 blockade on cardiomyocyte survival, and showed that erbB2 antibody (erbB2-Ab) caused a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in cell death. The mechanism for the deleterious effects of erbB2 blockade remains unclear, but a recent report showed that activation of erbB2 reduces doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes (12Timolati F. Ott D. Pentassuglia L. Giraud M.N. Perriard J.C. Suter T.M. Zuppinger C. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol.. 2006; 41: 845-854Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that erbB2-Ab-induced cell death in cardiomyocytes is a mitochondrial dependent process that involves ROS production. In this report, we show that erbB2 levels are decreased in an animal model of myocardial ischemia and in patients with ischemic CM. We then demonstrate that erbB2 blockade in cardiomyocytes leads to ROS production, and that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) protects against the damage induced by erbB2-Ab. We also find that erbB2 signaling in cardiomyocytes occurs through a mitochondrial, AKT-, and PKCα-dependent pathway. Moreover, the deleterious effects caused by the loss of erbB2 function require the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. Finally, by using an erbB2-specific siRNA, we demonstrate that the effects of erbB2 blockade evolve from the specific inhibition of the erbB2 pathway rather than through nonspecific effects of the antibody. Together, our results suggest that erbB2 blockade increases ROS through a mitochondrial pathway. Human Heart Samples—Non-failing, failing non-ischemic, and ischemic human heart samples were obtained from the Human Heart Tissue Bank at Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The failing non-ischemic and ischemic human heart tissues were procured from the explanted hearts of cardiac transplant recipients. Non-failing samples were obtained from unmatched organ donors with no history of cardiac disease (as measured by echocardiography) whose ejection fractions were >55% and whose hearts were unsuitable for transplantation. The explanted hearts were immediately placed in cold cardioplegic solution and were subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical analysis. Protocols for tissue procurement were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Informed consent was obtained from all transplant patients and from the families of the organ donors before tissue collection. Frozen samples were homogenized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin) and centrifuged at 37,500 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The myocardial extract (120 μg) was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and Western blotting was subsequently performed as described below. Ischemic Dog Tissue Extracts—Dog tissue samples were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Decker (Northwestern University). Experimental ischemic animal preparation was performed as described previously (13Decker R.S. Decker M.L. Kulikovskaya I. Nakamura S. Lee D.C. Harris K. Klocke F.J. Winegrad S. Circulation.. 2005; 111: 906-912Google Scholar). Tissue samples from dogs undergoing 75% left circumflex coronary artery occlusion were homogenized on ice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with the addition of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Total protein was quantified via Bradford assay, and 40 μg of each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting as described below. Preparation of Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes (NRCM)—NRCM preparation was performed as described previously (14Ardehali H. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circ. Res.. 2005; 97: 740-742Google Scholar). Cells were treated with control rabbit IgG or erbB2 IgG antibody for 24 h before viability studies or measurement of ROS levels. For Western blotting, mitochondria were isolated by using a kit from Pierce Biotechnology. Viability Studies—The mitochondrial membrane depolarizes rapidly at the onset of cell death. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) is a marker of cell injury and is assessed by using 100 nm of the fluorescent dye, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). After addition of TMRE, ΔΨm was measured by flow cytometry. For trypan blue studies, cells were detached and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). An equal volume of trypan blue was then added, and the numbers of unstained (viable) and stained (non-viable) cells were counted using a hemocytometer. The proportion of viable cells was determined by calculating the percentage of unstained cells. Three different counts were performed in at least three independent experiments for each group. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed with an LSM 510 META laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). The following wavelengths were used for excitation: 488 nm for green, 543 nm for red, and 405 nm for blue. Filters used for emission were: 505–530 nm for green, 565–615 nm for red, and 420–480 nm for blue. The lens objective was 40x Plan-NEOFLUAR NA 1.4 for red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (mitoSOX) and DCF studies. LSM 510 software (Zeiss) was used for data analysis. RNA Interference Experiments—An siRNA for erbB2 that had been previously used to knockdown erbB2 levels in NRCM was synthesized (Qiagen) (11Grazette L.P. Boecker W. Matsui T. Semigran M. Force T.L. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. J. Am. Coll Cardiol.. 2004; 44: 2231-2238Google Scholar). Non-silencing siRNA sequences from Qiagen and Dharmacon were used for control experiments. RNA duplexes were transfected into NRCM with a TransMessenger Kit (Qiagen). ROS Measurements—For studies with 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), myocytes were harvested by trypsinization, washed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS, and suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. H2DCFDA was then added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 30 min. Cells were washed, suspended in PBS, and analyzed by confocal microscopy or flow cytometry with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530-nm wavelength. For mitoSOX studies, 5 μm mitoSOX was added to NRCM, and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Western Blots—40 μg of dog myocardial extracts, 120 μg of human myocardial extracts, or NRCM mitochondrial extracts were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) and Western blotting was performed to detect erbB2 (anti-Neu, C-18) or cytochrome c (cyto c). Other antibodies used in our experiments are: AKT, phospho-AKT, PKCα and phosphor-PKCα (all purchased from Cell Signaling). Control IgG was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The blots were stripped and re-probed with anti-actin (I-19) antibody (human samples), anti-GAPDH antibody (dog samples), or anti-ATPase antibody (NRCM mitochondrial samples), which were used for normalization. All antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Chemiluminescent images were captured with an Epson Perfection 3490 Photo scanner, and the band intensities were determined with ImageJ analysis software (NIH). Data were quantified as the ratio of the luminescence of the given protein to that of the internal control. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Unpaired Student's t tests were performed for statistical comparisons. For all tests, a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Ischemia Decreases Levels of erbB2 Protein in Cardiomyocytes—To understand the role of the erbB2 pathway in cardiomyocyte survival, we first used Western blots to measure the levels of erbB2 in the explanted hearts of patients with ischemic or non-ischemic CM, as well as in normal hearts from organ donors that were unsuitable for transplant. Compared with normal hearts, the level of erbB2 protein was ∼40% lower in hearts from patients with ischemic CM, and a nonstatistically significant increase in erbB2 levels was observed in patients with nonischemic CM (Fig. 1, A and B). These results suggest that erbB2 levels in the heart decline only in response to ischemic damage. To better assess the role of erbB2 in ischemic injury, dogs were subjected to left circumflex (LCx) coronary constriction, which reduced coronary flow in the LCx territory by 75% (as determined by microsphere blood flow analysis) (13Decker R.S. Decker M.L. Kulikovskaya I. Nakamura S. Lee D.C. Harris K. Klocke F.J. Winegrad S. Circulation.. 2005; 111: 906-912Google Scholar). Extracts of heart tissue from dogs subjected to LCx constriction were examined by Western blotting to determine erbB2 levels. Tissue samples from both LCx (ischemic) and left anterior descending (LAD, nonischemic) territories were included in our studies. ErbB2 levels were reduced ∼60% in the ischemic LCx territory compared with the non-ischemic LAD samples (Fig. 1, C and D). Together with our findings in human CM samples, these results suggest that erbB2 levels are reduced in response to both acute and chronic ischemic damage. To assess whether the effects of ischemia on erbB2 occur through a pathway that is dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), erbB2 levels were measured in NRCM that had been treated with 500 μm of 1 dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG), which inhibits HIF-α prolyl hydroxylase and stabilizes HIF. As shown in Fig. 1, E and F, cells treated with DMOG displayed a significant decrease in the levels of erbB2, suggesting that the response to hypoxia occurs through a HIF-dependent pathway. Treatment with erbB2-Ab Increases Cell Death and ROS Production–Recently, it has been demonstrated that activation of the erbB2 receptor by neuregulin-1-reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress in adult rat cardiomyocytes (12Timolati F. Ott D. Pentassuglia L. Giraud M.N. Perriard J.C. Suter T.M. Zuppinger C. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol.. 2006; 41: 845-854Google Scholar), suggesting that the erbB2 pathway has a role in the inhibition of ROS production. We hypothesized that the deleterious effects of erbB2 blockade are caused by an increase in ROS production. To test this hypothesis, we assessed viability and ROS levels in NRCM treated with erbB2-Ab or pre-immune rabbit IgG as a control. Treatment with erbB2-Ab caused a significant and specific increase in cell death, as measured by TMRE uptake and trypan blue exclusion studies (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine whether treatment with erbB2-Ab increases ROS production, we treated cells with control IgG or erbB2-Ab then measured intracellular ROS production with fluorescent markers detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. There was a statistically significant, dose-dependent increase in the amount of ROS produced with erbB2-Ab treatment (Fig. 2, C and D). To determine whether erbB2-Ab-associated cell death is a direct result of this increase in ROS, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml erbB2-Ab in the presence and absence of 10 mm NAC (a reducing agent and ROS scavenger). In cells treated with erbB2-Ab, NAC restored viability to the levels observed in control cells (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that treatment of NRCM with erbB2-Ab increases intracellular ROS levels, which results in cell death. ErbB2 Signaling Occurs through a Mitochondrial Dependent Pathway—Because erbB2 blockade causes an increase in cellular ROS production, and the majority of ROS in the cell are produced in the mitochondria, we studied the role of mitochondria in erbB2 signaling. First, we determined the effects of erbB2-Ab on cyto c release into the cytoplasm. We treated NRCM with erbB2-Ab, and isolated protein from the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions. Treatment of NRCM with erbB2-Ab resulted in a marked decrease in mitochondrial cyto c levels compared with IgG treatment (Fig. 3A). To better characterize the link between the erbB2 pathway and mitochondria, we used cyclosporine A (CsA) to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), or diazoxide to activate the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (mitoKATP). Both CsA and diazoxide treatment reduced cell death caused by erbB2-Ab (Fig. 3B). Moreover, cells treated with CsA or diazoxide in combination with erbB2-Ab displayed significantly lower levels of ROS production than were measured in cells treated with erbB2-Ab alone (Fig. 3C). CsA also reduced baseline ROS, whereas diazoxide produced a significant effect only in the presence of erbB2. These results show that blocking the mPTP channel blocks the ROS-producing effects of erbB2-Ab treatment. This observation suggests that erbB2-Ab-induced ROS production and cell death occur through an mPTP-dependent pathway. Furthermore, activation of the pro-survival channel mitoKATP can reverse this effect. ErbB2-Ab-mediated Cell Death Is Regulated by a Bax/Bak-dependent Pathway—Growth factor-induced cell death is generally believed to be Bax/Bak-dependent (15Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science.. 2001; 292: 727-730Google Scholar). In response to an insult, these proteins translocate to the mitochondria and induce mitochondrial dependent cell death. To evaluate the role of Bax and Bak in erbB2-Ab-induced cell death, we examined cell death in WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in MEFs obtained from Bax/Bak double-knock-out (DKO) mice after treatment with erbB2-Ab or a control Ab. Wild type (WT) and DKO MEFs express similar levels of erbB2 at baseline (Fig. 4A). In WT MEFs, erbB2-Ab treatment significantly increased cell death compared with control-treated MEFs (Fig. 4B). However, in DKO MEFs, there was no increase in cell death associated with erbB2-Ab treatment (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that Bax and/or Bak are necessary for erbB2-Ab-mediated cell death, because their absence attenuated the cell death response associated with erbB2 blockade. Time Course of the Deleterious Effects of erbB2-Ab—The data presented thus far suggest that blockade of the erbB2 receptor increases cell death through a mitochondrial and ROS-dependent pathway. These results raise the question of whether cyto c release into the cytoplasm precedes or follows mitochondrial changes and ROS production. To answer this question, we analyzed the time course of ROS production, of changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and of the release of cyto c into the cytoplasm after treatment with erbB2-Ab or the control Ab. As shown in Fig. 5A, ROS production reaches significant levels 24 h after treatment, and the MMP (Fig. 5B) begins to change at 24 h and continues to decline at 48 h. However, the increase in cytoplasmic levels of cyto c does not reach statistical significance until about 48 h after treatment (Fig. 5, C and D). These results suggest that ROS production probably occurs before MMP loss and the release of cyto c into the cytoplasm, which subsequently results in cell death. Effects of erbB2-Ab on Cardiomyocytes Occur through an AKT- and PKCa-dependent Pathway—We then studied the signaling mechanisms that lead to the deleterious effects of erbB2-Ab on cardiomyocytes. Previous reports suggested that PI3K and AKT have a role in erbB2-mediated signal transduction (16Fuller S.J. Sivarajah K. Sugden P.H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol.. 2008; 44: 831-854Google Scholar). It has also been shown that PKCα is up-regulated and activated in breast cancer in response to erbB2-receptor activation (17Tan M. Li P. Sun M. Yin G. Yu D. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 3286-3295Google Scholar). Thus, we studied the role of PI3K, AKT, and PKCα in the erbB2-Ab-mediated pathway in the heart. NRCM were treated with the erbB2-Ab, and cell extracts were probed with AKT, p-AKT, and PKCα antibodies. Treatment with the erbB2-Ab resulted in a significant decrease in both total and phosphorylated AKT and PKCα protein (Fig. 6, A–D). These results suggest that the deleterious effects of erbB2-Ab are likely mediated through the inhibition of AKT and PKCα signaling. Reports also suggest that erbB2 signaling is mediated by a JNK-dependent pathway (18Le X.F. Arachchige-Don A.S. Mao W. Horne M.C. Bast Jr., R.C. Mol. Cancer Ther.. 2007; 6: 2843-2857Google Scholar). To study the role of this protein in erbB2-Ab-mediated cardiomyocyte death, NRCM were treated with 10 μm JNK inhibitor IX (CalBiochem) in the presence of either IgG or erbB2-Ab. The JNK inhibitor did not significantly change the rate of cell death when cells were treated with IgG or erbB2-Ab (Fig. 6E). These results suggest that erbB2-Ab-mediated cell death in cardiomyocytes probably occurs independently of the JNK pathway. Reduction of erbB2 Protein Increases Cell Death—To demonstrate that the effects of erbB2 blockade do not result from nonspecific Ab interactions, we used an siRNA that targets erbB2 as an alternative method for blocking erbB2 function. NRCM were treated with erbB2 or control siRNA for 48 h, and erbB2 protein levels were assessed by Western blotting. Treatment with the erbB2-specific siRNA significantly reduced erbB2 protein levels compared with control siRNA treatment (Fig. 7, A and B). Next, we used this approach to study the effects of a reduction in erbB2 protein levels on cell survival. NRCM treated with erbB2 siRNA exhibited a significant increase in cell death as assessed via TMRE uptake and trypan blue exclusion assays (Fig. 7, C and D). These results are consistent with our findings that erbB2 blockade induces cell death and suggest that the effects of the erbB2-Ab likely result from the specific inhibition of the erbB2 pathway. The cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor erbB2 plays an important role in a variety of cellular functions; however, it can also function as an oncogene in several malignancies, including breast, lung, and endometrial cancer (19Roskoski Jr., R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2004; 319: 1-11Google Scholar, 20Schlessinger J. Cell.. 2000; 103: 211-225Google Scholar). Therefore, erbB2 has become an important target for breast cancer therapy. Data suggest that trastuzumab (Herceptin) improves survival in patients with metastatic disease, and when used as an adjuvant (4Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Science.. 1989; 244: 707-712Google Scholar, 7Slamon D.J. Leyland-Jones B. Shak S. Fuchs H. Paton V. Bajamonde A. Fleming T. Eiermann W. Wolter J. Pegram M. Baselga J. Norton L. N. Engl. J. Med.. 2001; 344: 783-792Google Scholar); however, trastuzumab also contributes to the development of CM in a significant number of patients, especially in those who either have previously had anthracyclines or are treated with trastuzumab and anthracyclines together (8Keefe D.L. Cancer.. 2002; 95: 1592-1600Google Scholar). ErbB2 has been shown to play a role in cardiac development, as cardiac-specific knock-out of this protein in mice leads to dilated CM. However, the mechanism of erbB2-Ab-mediated cell death and the role of erbB2 in cell survival and in response to ischemic injury are not known. In this study, we examined the mechanism of cell death induced by erbB2 inhibition. Because receptor-mediated cell death is believed to be regulated by mitochondria (15Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science.. 2001; 292: 727-730Google Scholar, 21Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell.. 1998; 94: 481-490Google Scholar, 22Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell.. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar), we hypothesized that erbB2 blockade leads to activation of a mitochondrial pathway that results in an increase in cellular ROS production and subsequent cell death. To test this hypothesis, we treated NRCM with an inhibitory erbB2-Ab, then demonstrated that erbB2 blockade leads to an increase in ROS production, and that the deleterious effects of erbB2-Ab are reversed by the antioxidant NAC. We then showed that erbB2-Ab-mediated cell death is inhibited by an mPTP inhibitor and by an activator of mitoKATP, suggesting that mitochondria are involved in erbB2-Ab-mediated cell death. These chemicals also reversed erbB2-Ab-mediated ROS production. Finally, to demonstrate that the deleterious effects of erbB2-Ab on cardiomyocytes do not evolve from nonspecific effects of the Ab, we showed that erbB2 knockdown with siRNA increased cell death. Our results are consistent with those of Grazette et al. (11Grazette L.P. Boecker W. Matsui T. Semigran M. Force T.L. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. J. Am. Coll Cardiol.. 2004; 44: 2231-2238Google Scholar) who showed that the erbB2-Ab mediates cell death. We also demonstrate that erbB2-Ab-mediated cell death signaling requires both Bax and Bak, as MEFs lacking these proteins were resistant to the deleterious effects of erbB2-Ab. These data are in accord with the generally accepted model that receptor-mediated cell death occurs through a mitochondrial and Bax/Bak-dependent pathway (15Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science.. 2001; 292: 727-730Google Scholar). Our findings not only provide mechanistic insights into the biological effects of erbB2-receptor blockade, they may also have therapeutic implications. Patients with breast cancer who receive trastuzumab may develop heart failure. Because our understanding of how erbB2 signaling leads to myocardial cell death is limited, there are no effective approaches to attenuate the deleterious effects of trastuzumab on the heart. Our current results provide evidence for two potential therapeutic targets for the prevention of trastuzumab-induced CM: cellular ROS and mitochondria. Cellular ROS are significantly increased after treatment with erbB2-Ab; however, an antioxidant may reverse this effect. Thus, concurrent antioxidant therapy with trastuzumab may attenuate the adverse effects of this drug on the heart. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that erbB2-Ab-induced cell death occurs through a mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, patients who receive trastuzumab may also benefit from drugs that inhibit mPTP or activate the protective mitoKATP channel. The effectiveness of these interventions requires further study. The levels of many proteins are altered in response to ischemic injury in the heart. Here, we show that erbB2 levels decrease in response to both acute ischemia and chronic ischemic damage. The observation that patients with chronic ischemic CM displayed lower levels of erbB2 suggests that erbB2 may be an important factor in ischemic damage of the heart. These results, along with our observation that diminished erbB2 signaling results in an increase in cell death, suggest that erbB2 is important for normal cardiomyocyte function. Furthermore, changes in the activity of erbB2 may make heart cells more susceptible to injury from ischemic damage. Thus, increasing the activity of erbB2 in the ischemic heart may prove to be a novel therapeutic tool for treating ischemic heart disease. In summary, our results indicate that erbB2 blockade leads to cell death through mitochondrial and ROS-dependent pathways. We also show that erbB2-mediated cell death occurs through AKT- and PKCα-dependent pathways. Furthermore, both acute and chronic ischemic damage to the heart decreased erbB2 levels. These findings suggest that concomitant therapy with agents that regulate redox signaling (such as antioxidants) or target mitochondrial death channels may reduce cardiac injury from trastuzumab in cancer patients.

https://openalex.org/W1986256291,"Artemisinin, a naturally occurring component of Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwood, is a potent anti-malaria compound that has recently been shown to have anti-proliferative effects on a number of human cancer cell types, although little is know about the molecular mechanisms of this response. We have observed that artemisinin treatment triggers a stringent G1 cell cycle arrest of LNCaP (lymph node carcinoma of the prostate) human prostate cancer cells that is accompanied by a rapid down-regulation of CDK2 and CDK4 protein and transcript levels. Transient transfection with promoter-linked luciferase reporter plasmids revealed that artemisinin strongly inhibits CDK2 and CDK4 promoter activity. Deletion analysis of the CDK4 promoter revealed a 231-bp artemisinin-responsive region between -1737 and -1506. Site-specific mutations revealed that the Sp1 site at -1531 was necessary for artemisinin responsiveness in the context of the CDK4 promoter. DNA binding assays as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that this Sp1-binding site in the CDK4 promoter forms a specific artemisinin-responsive DNA-protein complex that contains the Sp1 transcription factor. Artemisinin reduced phosphorylation of Sp1, and when dephosphorylation of Sp1 was inhibited by treatment of cells with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, the ability of artemisinin to down-regulate Sp1 interactions with the CDK4 promoter was ablated, rendering the CDK4 promoter unresponsive to artemisinin. Finally, overexpression of Sp1 mostly reversed the artemisinin down-regulation of CDK4 promoter activity and partially reversed the cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a key event in the artemisinin anti-proliferative effects in prostate cancer cells is the transcriptional down-regulation of CDK4 expression by disruption of Sp1 interactions with the CDK4 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2062518702,"xCT, the functional subunit of the cystine/glutamate transporter xc- system, plays a critical role in the maintenance of intracellular glutathione and redox balance. Disruption of xCT significantly inhibits the growth of a variety of carcinomas, including lymphoma, glioma, prostate and breast cancer. However, the role of xCT in tumor metastasis remains largely unknown. In this study, both xCT+/+ and xCT−/− melanocytes were used to evaluate the role of xCT in adhesion. xCT activity was suppressed by an inhibitor, sulfasalazine (SASP), or by xCT siRNA in an esophageal cancer cell line, KYSE150. We found that disruption of xCT enhanced homotypic cell–cell adhesion and attenuated cell–extracellular matrix adhesion. SASP significantly inhibited both cell invasion of KYSE150 in vitro and its experimental metastasis in nude mice. Caveolin-1 was upregulated and β-catenin was recruited to the plasma membrane when xCT was deficient, which were followed by the inhibition of β-catenin transcriptional activity. Further study revealed that the upregulation of caveolin-1 and inhibition of tumor cell invasion were mediated by reactive oxygen species-induced p38 MAPK activation. These results first establish the role of xCT in tumor metastasis and implicate a potential target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2171771398,"Although autophagy maintains normal neural function by degrading misfolded proteins, little is known about how neurons activate this integral response. Furthermore, classical methods of autophagy induction used with nonneural cells, such as starvation, simply result in neuron death. To study neuronal autophagy, we cultured primary cortical neurons from transgenic mice that ubiquitously express green fluorescent protein-tagged LC3 and monitored LC3-I to LC3-II conversion by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Evaluation of different culture media led us to discover that culturing primary neurons in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without B27 supplementation robustly activates autophagy. We validated this nutrient-limited media approach for inducing autophagy by showing that 3-methyl-adenine treatment and Atg5 RNA interference knockdown each inhibits LC3-I to LC3-II conversion. Evaluation of B27 supplement components yielded insulin as the factor whose absence induced autophagy in primary neurons, and this activation was mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent. When we tested if nutrient-limited media could protect neurons expressing polyglutamine-expanded proteins against cell death, we observed a strong protective effect, probably due to autophagy activation. Our results indicate that nutrient deprivation can be used to understand the regulatory basis of neuronal autophagy and implicate diminished insulin signaling in the activation of neuronal autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2060372899,"Background/Aims microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate cognate mRNAs post-transcriptionally. Human embryonic stem cells (hESC), which exhibit the characteristics of pluripotency and self-renewal, may serve as a model to study the role of miRNAs in early human development. We aimed to determine whether endodermally-differentiated hESC demonstrate a unique miRNA expression pattern, and whether overexpression of endoderm-specific miRNA may affect hESC differentiation. Methods miRNA expression was profiled in undifferentiated and NaButyrate-induced differentiated hESC of two lines, using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR. Then, the effect of lentiviral-based overexpression of liver-specific miR-122 on hESC differentiation was analyzed, using genomewide gene microarrays. Results The miRNA profiling revealed expression of three novel miRNAs in undifferentiated and differentiated hESC. Upon NaButyrate induction, two of the most upregulated miRNAs common to both cell lines were miR-24 and miR-10a, whose target genes have been shown to inhibit endodermal differentiation. Furthermore, induction of several liver-enriched miRNAs, including miR-122 and miR-192, was observed in parallel to induction of endodermal gene expression. Stable overexpression of miR-122 in hESC was unable to direct spontaneous differentiation towards a clear endodermal fate, but rather, delayed general differentiation of these cells. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that expression of specific miRNAs correlates with that of specific genes upon differentiation, and highlight the potential role of miRNAs in endodermal differentiation of hESC."
https://openalex.org/W2035279803,"It is system dynamics that determines the function of cells, tissues and organisms. To develop mathematical models and estimate their parameters are an essential issue for studying dynamic behaviors of biological systems which include metabolic networks, genetic regulatory networks and signal transduction pathways, under perturbation of external stimuli. In general, biological dynamic systems are partially observed. Therefore, a natural way to model dynamic biological systems is to employ nonlinear state-space equations. Although statistical methods for parameter estimation of linear models in biological dynamic systems have been developed intensively in the recent years, the estimation of both states and parameters of nonlinear dynamic systems remains a challenging task. In this report, we apply extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to the estimation of both states and parameters of nonlinear state-space models. To evaluate the performance of the EKF for parameter estimation, we apply the EKF to a simulation dataset and two real datasets: JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling transduction pathways datasets. The preliminary results show that EKF can accurately estimate the parameters and predict states in nonlinear state-space equations for modeling dynamic biochemical networks."

Caspase-6 is an executioner caspase that also appears to have regulatory functions in hematopoetic cell lines. We aimed to elucidate the role of caspase-6 in bile acid-induced apoptosis. The major human hydrophobic bile acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA, 75 μmol/liter), rapidly induced caspase-6 cleavage in HepG2-Ntcp human hepatoma cells. GCDCA-induced, but not tumor necrosis factor α- or etoposide-induced activation of effector caspases-3 and -7 was significantly reduced by 50% in caspase-6-deficient HepG2-Ntcp cells as well as in primary rat hepatocytes pretreated with a caspase-6 inhibitor. Inhibition of caspase-9 reduced GCDCA-induced activation of caspase-6, whereas inhibition of caspase-6 reduced activation of caspase-8 placing caspase-6 between caspase-9 and caspase-8. GCDCA also induced apoptosis in Fas-deficient Hep3B-Ntcp and HuH7-Ntcp hepatoma cells. In addition, GCDCA-induced apoptosis was reduced by 50% in FADD-deficient HepG2-Ntcp cells, whereas apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α was reduced by 90%. Collectively, these observations suggest that GCDCA can induce hepatocyte apoptosis in the absence of death receptor signaling, presumably by a compensatory mitochondrial pathway.

Graf D. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology.. 2003; 125: 839-853Google Scholar, 9Reinehr R. Becker S. Keitel V. Eberle A. Grether-Beck S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology.. 2005; 129: 2009-2031Google Scholar). GCDCA-induced oligomerization of Fas then causes activation of the initiator caspase-8, which requires the adaptor protein FADD. In hepatocytes, caspase-8 then would cause apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway (10Barnhart B.C. Alappat E.C. Peter M.E. Semin Immunol... 2003; 15: 185-193Google Scholar). In cell-free systems, however, toxic bile acids like GCDCA can directly cause mitochondrial damage leading to cytochrome c leakage, which is followed by the activation of caspase-9 via the apoptosome (11Sola S. Brito M.A. Brites D. Moura J.J. Rodrigues C.M. Clin. Sci. (Lond.).. 2002; 103: 475-485Google Scholar). GCDCA can dose-dependently induce the mitochondrial permeability transition in isolated human mitochondria (12Sokol R.J. Dahl R. Devereaux M.W. Yerushalmi B. Kobak G.E. Gumpricht E. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr... 2005; 41: 235-243Google Scholar). In addition, a marked increase in reactive oxygen species production was observed within minutes in the mitochondria treated with GCDCA (12Sokol R.J. Dahl R. Devereaux M.W. Yerushalmi B. Kobak G.E. Gumpricht E. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr... 2005; 41: 235-243Google Scholar). Procaspase-8 appears to be processed late in Fas-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis, suggesting that only a small amount of procaspase-8 may actually be activated at the Fas receptor (13Bajt M.L. Lawson J.A. Vonderfecht S.L. Gujral J.S. Jaeschke H. Toxicol. Sci... 2000; 58: 109-117Google Scholar). Although caspase-6 is generally believed to be an effector caspase (14Cohen G.M. Biochem. J... 1997; 326: 1-16Google Scholar), it has recently been shown in Jurkat cell extracts to efficiently cleave caspase-8 and induce Bid-dependent cytochrome c release (15Cowling V. Downward J. Cell Death Differ.. 2002; 9: 1046-1056Google Scholar). The role of caspase-6 in bile acid-induced liver cell apoptosis remains unclear. The aims of our study were, therefore, to investigate the role of caspase-6 as well as the death receptor Fas in human liver cell lines for the induction of apoptosis by the major human hydrophobic bile acid GCDCA. Materials—The caspase inhibitors Z-VEID-fmk, Z-LEHD-fmk, and Z-IETD-fmk were from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), Z-VAD-fmk was from Promega (Madison, WI). Primary antibodies against full-length and cleaved caspases-3, -6, -7, and -9 as well as Bid were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Primary antibodies against caspase-8 were a generous gift from Dr. Peter Krammer (Division of Immunogenetics, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany). Primary antibodies against the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) were a generous gift of Dr. Bruno Stieger (University of Zurich, Switzerland). Primary antibodies against Fas and cytochrome were from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against β-actin as well as GCDCA, taurolithocholic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, etoposide, and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture and Stable Transfection of HepG2, Hep3B, and HuH7 Cells—HepG2, Hep3B, and HuH7 cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium (pH 7.4) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 1 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (complete culture medium). For transfection with rat Ntcp, HepG2 cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates. After reaching ∼80% confluence, cells were transfected using a pcDNA3.1/Ntcp construct (16Glasova H. Berghaus T.M. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Paumgartner G. Beuers U. Eur. J. Clin. Investig... 2002; 32: 437-442Google Scholar). Complete culture medium was replaced by 2 ml of serum-free medium, containing 2 μg of the respective plasmid cDNA and 5 μl of FuGENE (Roche) in each well. After 4 h (37 °C; 5% CO2), 200 μl of fetal bovine serum were added to each well. Cells were incubated for 24 h (37 °C; 5% CO2) and subsequently harvested. Continuous selection was achieved by growth in culture medium supplemented with 1000 μg/ml (HepG2) or 500 μg/ml (Hep3B, HuH7) active geneticin. Preparation of Primary Rat Hepatocytes—Livers of narcotized male Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused 10 min with carbogen (95% O2, 5%CO2) equilibrated buffer A (122 mmol/liter sodium chloride, 5 mmol/liter potassium chloride, 0.4 mmol/liter potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 2 mmol/liter disodium hydrogen phosphate, 25 mmol/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.5 mmol/liter EGTA) at 37 °C, then 5 min with buffer B (buffer A without EGTA, with 0.5 mmol/liter magnesium chloride, 0.4 mmol/liter magnesium sulfate, 3 mmol/liter calcium chloride, 0.225 g/liter collagenase IV) in a recirculating fashion. Tissue was minced with scissors and cells suspended by shaking in buffer B (without collagenase). Cells were filtered through 80-μm cheesecloth, centrifuged for 5 min at 50 × g at 4 °C, and suspended with buffer B. Cells were overlaid at 50% (v/v) isotonic and buffered Percoll™ (Amersham Biosciences) and then centrifuged at 50 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet with living hepatocytes suspended in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) with 15 mmol/liter HEPES, 5% fetal calf serum, 0.1 μmol/liter insulin, 0.1 μmol/liter dexamethasone, 1% antibiotics and antimycotics (Invitrogen), and once again washed. Cells were counted and viability controlled by trypan blue stain. Cells were seeded in collagen-coated (5 μg/cm2) cell culture dishes with a density of 105 cells/cm2. Quantification of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was determined by assessing the characteristic nuclear changes of apoptosis using the DNA-binding dye 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride and fluorescence microscopy. In addition, apoptosis was determined by measuring activation of the effector caspases-3 and -7. The activity assays were performed in subconfluent cells using commercially available caspase assay kits from Promega (ApoONE®) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Caspase-8 Assay—Caspase-8 activity was quantified in primary rat hepatocytes using a commercially available assay kit from Promega (Caspase-Glo 8 Assay®) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Primary rat hepatocytes were used after 24 h of culture and then stimulated with the respective bile acids for 4 h. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured HepG2, Huh7, and Hep3B cells using the Nucleo Spin RNA II kit (Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Purified RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry and cDNA was prepared using the reverse transcriptase Superscript III (Invitrogen) as previously described in detail (17Bernt C. Vennegeerts T. Beuers U. Rust C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2006; 340: 800-806Google Scholar). 2 μg of the cDNA product was amplified by PCR with Taq DNA polymerase using standard protocols and the following primers for human Fas: sense 5′-AGA GTG TGT GCA CAA GGC TG-3′ and antisense 5′-CAC TCT GCA ACC TCT CTC CC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, sense 5′-CGA GAG AAC TGA TTG ATA CCA T-3′ and antisense 5′-TGG CAT ACT ACC AGA TGA CC-3′. Products of PCR were analyzed with 2% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining. siRNA-mediated Gene Silencing of Caspase-6, -8, and -9—siRNA targeted to the human caspase-6 (catalog number M-004406-02), caspase-8 (catalog number M-003466-05), caspase-3 (catalog number M-004307-02), and caspase-9 (catalog number M-003309-01) mRNA sequence as well as random oligonucleotide controls (catalog number D-001210-01) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). HepG2-Ntcp cells at 30–40% confluency were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) using 10–50 nmol/liter siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used for experiments 24 to 48 h after transfection. Down-regulation of caspase-6, caspase-8, caspase-3, and caspase-9 was shown by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Subconfluent cells were stimulated, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% Triton, 100 μmol/liter vanadate, 10 mmol/liter NaF, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete® by Roche), incubated for 5 min on ice, sonicated, and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant (50 μg of protein) was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany), and probed against the appropriate primary antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 in 1% milk, TBS-T and 1% albumin overnight. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was incubated at a dilution of 1:5000. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against β-actin (1:3,500) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:100,000) to ensure equal loading. For cytochrome c immunoblots, cytosolic fractions were prepared by washing the cells twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraping them with 150 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7,4, 250 mmol/liter saccharose, 2 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmol/liter 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μmol/liter leupeptin, and 25 μg of aprotinin) and homogenization by passing several times through a 26-gauge 5/8 inch needle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 8 min at 25 p.s.i. (A-110 rotor, Beckman Airfuge). The supernatant was recovered as the cytosolic fraction and normalized by protein content. For cytochrome c immunoblots 10 μg of protein were loaded onto 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Adenoviral Infection—The recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5-dnFADD (a generous gift of Dr. H. Moshage, Center for Liver, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen), and Addl70-3 (a generous gift of Dr. Frank Graham, Department of Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada), an empty adenovirus for control experiments (18Bett A.J. Haddara W. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1994; 91: 8802-8806Google Scholar), were grown and purified by banding twice in CsCl gradients as described previously (19Rust C. Karnitz L.M. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Simari R.D. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 20210-20216Google Scholar). For adenovirus infection, HepG2-Ntcp cells were grown to 50–75% confluence. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and Ad5-dnFADD or Addl70-3 viral stock solutions were added at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5. After 18 h, medium was removed and cells were split and then used for experiments 48 h later. Immunocytochemical AU1 Staining—To visualize expression of Ad5-dnFADD in infected cells, immunocytochemical staining for the AU1-tag of this adenoviral plasmid was performed after infection (m.o.i. 5) in HepG2-Ntcp cells seeded on uncoated glass coverslips in 12-well culture plates. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed using paraformaldehyde (3%, 20 min, 4 °C). Fixed cells were blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Antibodies against AU1 (1:200) were diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBS-T and applied for 24 h. After washing with TBS-T, Alexa Fluor 488 (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-coupled secondary antibodies (1:200 in TBS-T) and Hoechst 33342 (DAPI, 1:200) were applied for 1 h. Cells were visualized using an Axioskop (Zeiss, Germany). Statistics—Results from at least 3 independent experiments are expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences between groups were compared by analysis of variance for repeated measures and a post hoc Bonferroni test to compare for multiple comparisons. Activation of Caspase-6 Is Important for GCDCA-induced Apoptosis—The Fas-containing human hepatoma cell line HepG2 stably transfected with the bile acid transporter sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) (16Glasova H. Berghaus T.M. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Paumgartner G. Beuers U. Eur. J. Clin. Investig... 2002; 32: 437-442Google Scholar) was used to investigate the role of caspase-6 in GCDCA-induced apoptosis. We confirmed that these HepG2-Ntcp cells express Ntcp and effectively transport radiolabeled taurocholic acid (data not shown). GCDCA is known to effectively induce apoptosis in human hepatoma cells and primary rat hepatocytes in a concentration-dependent manner at low micromolar concentrations of 50–100 μmol/liter (5Reinehr R. Graf D. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology.. 2003; 125: 839-853Google Scholar, 20Rust C. Bauchmuller K. Bernt C. Vennegeerts T. Fickert P. Fuchsbichler A. Beuers U. Gut.. 2006; 55: 719-727Google Scholar). Based on these previous observations we used GCDCA at a concentration of 75 μmol/liter for the in vitro studies. We first tested whether GCDCA induces cleavage of caspase-6 in HepG2-Ntcp cells. Indeed, GCDCA (75 μmol/liter) induced caspase-6-cleavage that started 30 min after bile acid administration and reached a maximum after 2–3 h (Fig. 1A). Activation of caspase-6 preceded activation of the initiator caspase-8 in this experimental setting. We next transfected HepG2-Ntcp cells with specific siRNA against caspase-6 to scrutinize the role of caspase-6 in bile acid-induced apoptosis. Full-length caspase-6 was almost completely down-regulated 24 h after transfection with siRNA against caspase-6 at a concentration of 50 nmol/liter, whereas no reduction was observed in scrambled siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). We next analyzed if bile acid-induced apoptosis is reduced in caspase-6 siRNA-transfected HepG2-Ntcp cells. In cells transfected with siRNA against caspase-6 for 24 h, GCDCA-induced apoptosis was markedly reduced as determined by morphological assessment of apoptosis by DAPI staining (Fig. 2A) and caspase-3/-7 measurement (Fig. 2B). Because quantification of apoptosis by DAPI staining and by a caspase-3/-7 assay led to similar results, the latter was used for the remainder of the experiments. Although GCDCA-induced apoptosis was reduced by 50%, apoptosis induced by TNFα (50 ng/ml) in combination with actinomycin D (0.2 μg/ml) or etoposide (30 μmol/liter) was unchanged in caspase-6 siRNA-transfected cells, suggesting that caspase-6 is important for bile acid-induced apoptosis, but not for apoptosis induced by other stimuli (Fig. 2B). Comparable results were obtained with 20 μmol/liter taurolithocholic acid, another proapoptotic bile acid (data not shown). GCDCA-induced Caspase-6 Cleavage Is Downstream of Caspase-9 and -3 and Upstream of Caspase-8—In untransfected and scrambled siRNA-transfected cells, GCDCA (75 μmol/liter) activated caspases-3, -6, -7, -8, and -9 after 4 h as shown by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against cleaved caspases (Fig. 3A). In caspase-6 siRNA-transfected cells, cleaved caspase-6 was, as expected, not detectable and cleaved caspases-3 and -7 were reduced after stimulation with GCDCA (Fig. 3A), confirming the results of the caspase-3/-7 activity assays. In addition, initiator caspase-9 and caspase-8 were also reduced in caspase-6 siRNA-transfected cells, suggesting that caspase-6 might by part of a feedback loop in GCDCA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Activation of caspases-3, -6, and -7 was also dose-dependently reduced in GCDCA-stimulated HepG2-Ntcp cells using increasing concentrations of the caspase-6 inhibitor Z-VEID-fmk and reached control levels at a concentration of 20 μmol/liter (Fig. 3B). Likewise, GCDCA-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced using 20 μmol/liter Z-VEID-fmk as determined by a caspase-3/-7 assay (data not shown). Although cleaved caspase-8 was reduced to control levels using 10 μmol/liter of Z-VEID-fmk in GCDCA-stimulated cells, cleaved caspase-9 was detectable even at the highest Z-VEID-fmk concentration in the same experimental setting (Fig. 3B). It has to be noted, however, that the specificity of these caspase inhibitors has been questioned in a recent study (21McStay G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ.. 2008; 15: 322-331Google Scholar) and should therefore be interpreted with caution. We next used primary rat hepatocytes to test if these results are reproducible in non-malignant hepatocytes. GCDCA at 75 μmol/liter induced cytochrome c release and hepatocyte apoptosis in primary rat hepatocytes that was also significantly reduced using the caspase-6 inhibitor Z-VEID-fmk as assessed by morphological (not shown) and biochemical criteria (Fig. 4A) of apoptosis. In this experimental setting, inhibition of caspase-6 also reduced GCDCA-induced caspase-8 activity to control levels (Fig. 4B) and inhibited caspase-3 activation (Fig. 4C). Because the true specificity of caspase inhibitors is unclear (21McStay G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ.. 2008; 15: 322-331Google Scholar), these data again have to be interpreted with caution. However, a siRNA approach is not technically feasible in primary hepatocytes. We next used caspase-9 siRNA-transfected HepG2-Ntcp cells to determine whether caspase-6 activation is caspase-9-dependent. Full-length caspase-9 was down-regulated to almost control levels 24 h after transfection with siRNA against caspase-9 at a concentration of 50 nmol/liter (Fig. 5A). Apoptosis was reduced by 60% in these caspase-9 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5B). GCDCA-induced activation of caspase-6 was markedly down-regulated in caspase-9 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained using the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-fmk (5–20 μmol/liter), which dose-dependently reduced cleavage of caspase-9 as well as caspase-6, whereas full-length capase-9 levels remained unchanged (data not shown). We repeated these experiments with caspase-3 siRNA-transfected cells to determine next, if activation of caspase-6 is also caspase-3-dependent. Caspase-6 activation was reduced in caspase-3 siRNA-transfected cells treated with GCDCA (75 μmol/liter) for 2 h (Fig. 5C). Apoptosis was markedly reduced in these caspase-3-deficient cells as determined by morphology (Fig. 5D) and caspase-3/-7 activation (not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate that caspase-6 is activated in bile acid-induced apoptosis. GCDCA-induced activation of caspase-6 appears to be downstream of caspase-9 and caspase-3 as well as upstream of caspase-8, suggesting that caspase-6 might be part of a feedback loop in bile acid-induced apoptosis (Fig. 9). This effect is bile acid-specific, because apoptosis induced by other well defined stimuli was unchanged in caspase-6-deficient cells. GCDCA Effectively Induces Hepatocyte Apoptosis in the Absence of Fas—It has been suggested that bile acids can induce hepatocyte apoptosis by both Fas death receptor-dependent and death receptor-independent signaling (9Reinehr R. Becker S. Keitel V. Eberle A. Grether-Beck S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology.. 2005; 129: 2009-2031Google Scholar, 12Sokol R.J. Dahl R. Devereaux M.W. Yerushalmi B. Kobak G.E. Gumpricht E. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr... 2005; 41: 235-243Google Scholar). To determine the role of the death receptor Fas in GCDCA-induced apoptosis we employed the Fas-deficient human hepatoma cell lines Hep3B and HuH7 (22Jiang S. Song M.J. Shin E.C. Lee M.O. Kim S.J. Park J.H. Hepatology.. 1999; 29: 101-110Google Scholar, 23Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N. Takimoto R. El-Deiry W. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 38610-38618Google Scholar). First, the absence of Fas was confirmed both on mRNA and protein levels. In contrast to HepG2, neither Fas-mRNA nor Fas-protein were detectable in Hep3B and HuH7 cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Because bile acid-mediated apoptosis requires transport of bile acids into cells (8Faubion W. Guicciardi M. Miyoshi H. Bronk S. Roberts P. Svingen P. Kaufmann S. Gores G. J. Clin. Investig... 1999; 103: 137-145Google Scholar), we then developed bile acid transporting cell lines. Both Hep3B and HuH7 hepatoma cell lines were stably transfected with the sodium-dependent bile acid transporter Ntcp. Expression of Ntcp was confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. 6, C and D) and efficient sodium-dependent bile acid uptake was confirmed by performing uptake studies with radiolabeled taurocholate (data not shown). GCDCA (75 μmol/liter) induced apoptosis in Hep3B-Ntcp and HuH7-Ntcp cells after 4 h as measured by caspase-3/-7 activity (Fig. 6, C and D). Taurolithocholic acid, another proapoptotic bile acid, also induced significant apoptosis in Hep3B-Ntcp cells (Fig. 6C) after 4 h. In both cell lines, GCDCA induced marked cytochrome c release as a marker of mitochondrial dysfunction in the Ntcp-transfected, but not in the parent cell lines (Fig. 6E). Likewise, GCDCA did not induce apoptosis in the parent non-bile salt transporting Hep3B and HuH7 cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Taken together, these results suggest that GCDCA can effectively induce hepatocyte apoptosis in the absence of Fas. GCDCA-induced Apoptosis Is Reduced in FADD-deficient Cells—To determine whether other death receptors in addition to Fas might be involved in GCDCA-induced apoptosis, we next inhibited FADD, because all major death receptors require the FADD adaptor protein for transmitting their apoptotic signal (24Tourneur L. Buzyn A. Chiocchia G. Med. Immunol... 2005; 4: 1Google Scholar). This was achieved by infection of HepG2-Ntcp cells with an adenoviral construct containing a dominant negative FADD (Ad5-dnFADD). At a m.o.i. of 5, HepG2-Ntcp cells were effectively infected with Ad5-dnFADD as demonstrated by immunocytochemical staining of the AU1-tag (Fig. 7A) as well as immunoblot analysis (Fig. 7B). Infection of HepG2-Ntcp cells with this Ad5-dnFADD construct reduced GCDCA-mediated apoptosis by 50% as demonstrated by caspase-3/-7 assays (Fig. 7C). However, when apoptosis was induced by TNFα in combination with actinomycin D, a well known death receptor stimulus that requires recruitment of FADD, caspase-3/-7 activity was reduced to almost control levels. Thus, GCDCA can induce hepatocyte apoptosis even in the absence of Fas as well as of other death receptors, probably by directly activating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as an escape mechanism. Role of Caspase-8 in GCDCA-induced Apoptosis—Caspase-8 is the first caspase to become activated in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. To study the role of caspase-8 in GCDCA-induced apoptosis we induced down-regulation of caspase-8 in HepG2-Ntcp cells using specific siRNA against caspase-8. Full-length caspase-8 was down-regulated to almost control levels 24 h after transfection with siRNA against caspase-8 at a concentration of 10 and 50 nmol/liter, whereas no reduction was observed in controls transfected with siRNA against green fluorescent protein (Fig. 8A). The lower siRNA concentration (10 nmol/liter) was used for the remainder of the experiments. We next analyzed if bile acid-induced apoptosis as determined by a caspase-3/-7 assay is reduced in caspase-8 siRNA-transfected HepG2-Ntcp cells. In cells transfected with siRNA against caspase-8 (10 nmol/liter), GCDCA-induced apoptosis was reduced by 26% (Fig. 8B). In contrast, caspase-3/7 activity was reduced by 79% when apoptosis was induced by TNFα in combination with actinomycin D, a well known death receptor stimulus that requires caspase-8 signaling. In untransfected and control siRNA-transfected cells, GCDCA (75 μmol/liter) activated caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 after 4 h as shown by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against cleaved caspases (Fig. 8C). In caspase-8 siRNA-transfected cells, full-length and cleaved caspase-8 was markedly reduced, but cleaved caspases-3, -7, and -9 were nearly unchanged after stimulation with GCDCA (Fig. 8C). In contrast, cleaved caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 were hardly detectable in caspase-8 siRNA-transfected cells, when apoptosis was induced with TNFα and actinomycin D, indicating that lower levels of activated caspase-8 are needed in GCDCA-induced apoptosis in contrast to true death receptor-induced apoptosis. GCDCA-induced cleavage of Bid as a functional read-out of caspase-8 inhibition was reduced in caspase-8 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 8D). Of note, activation of caspase-6 was also markedly reduced in caspase-8 siRNA-transfected cells treated with GCDCA (Fig. 8D). Collectively, these observations indicate that proapoptotic bile acids can still induce hepatocyte apoptosis, when the extrinsic death receptor pathways are blocked. The novel findings of the present study indicate that caspase-6 plays a critical role in bile acid-induced apoptosis of human liver cell lines and primary rat hepatocytes. In addition, this study suggests that major human hydrophobic bile acids like GCDCA are still able to induce hepatocyte apoptosis when death-receptor pathways are blocked. The role of caspase-6 in hepatocyte apoptosis has not been studied so far. Caspase-6 is generally considered to be a member of the executioner caspases in the caspase family of cell death proteases (14Cohen G.M. Biochem. J... 1997; 326: 1-16Google Scholar). Similar to the other known executioner caspases, caspase-3 and -7, caspase-6 has a short prodomain, but appears to play only a minor role in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (14Cohen G.M. Biochem. J... 1997; 326: 1-16Google Scholar, 25Lavrik I.N. Golks A. Krammer P.H. J. Clin. Investig... 2005; 115: 2665-2672Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, caspase-6 has recently been identified as a protease that can directly cleave caspase-8 in cytochrome c-activated extracts (15Cowling V. Downward J. Cell Death Differ.. 2002; 9: 1046-1056Google Scholar). In addition, purified caspase-6 was sufficient to induce Bid-dependent cytochrome c releasing activity in Jurkat cell extracts, whereas inhibition of caspase-6 reduced caspase-8 activation (15Cowling V. Downward J. Cell Death Differ.. 2002; 9: 1046-1056Google Scholar). There is also evidence that caspase-6 is an initiator caspase in reservatrol-induced apoptosis in T cell leukemia cell lines (26Bernhard D. Tinhofer I. Tonko M. Hubl H. Ausserlechner M.J. Greil R. Kofler R. Csordas A. Cell Death Differ.. 2000; 7: 834-842Google Scholar). However, caspase-6 does not seem to play a major role in anticancer drug-induced apoptosis in cancer cell lines (27Loegering D.A. Ruchaud S. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. Cell Death Differ.. 2006; 13: 346-347Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by the Fas antibody Jo-2 in C3Heb/FeJ mice was used to analyze the time course of caspase-8 activation (13Bajt M.L. Lawson J.A. Vonderfecht S.L. Gujral J.S. Jaeschke H. Toxicol. Sci... 2000; 58: 109-117Google Scholar). Interestingly, the majority of procaspase-8 was processed late in this experimental system, suggesting that only a small amount of procaspase-8 was actually activated at the Fas receptor, whereas most of caspase-8 activation supposedly occurred by one or more unidentified effector caspases after mitochondrial activation (13Bajt M.L. Lawson J.A. Vonderfecht S.L. Gujral J.S. Jaeschke H. Toxicol. Sci... 2000; 58: 109-117Google Scholar). In our study, caspase-6 was strongly activated in bile acid-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase-6 in human hepatoma cells significantly inhibited GCDCA-induced caspase-8 cleavage and apoptosis, therefore establishing caspase-6 as a potential activator of caspase-8 and confirming that this pathway may have a critical role in promotion of bile acid-induced apoptosis. In contrast, apoptosis induced by treatment with TNFα in combination with actinomycin D or etoposide was unchanged in caspase-6-deficient human hepatoma cells. Activation of the effector caspases-3 and -7 was also markedly reduced in caspase-6-deficient cells. In addition, down-regulation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 by specific siRNA resulted in a distinct reduction of caspase-6 activation in GCDCA-induced apoptosis suggesting that these caspases are upstream of caspase-6 in our experimental system. Caspase-6 has also been placed downstream of caspase-3 in the past (28Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 144: 281-292Google Scholar). Taken together, caspase-6 appears to be part of a feedback loop in bile acid-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes thereby enhancing the toxicity of proapototic bile acids (Fig. 9). Further studies using in vivo models of liver injury should not only provide a more complete picture of the role of caspase-6 in bile acid-induced apoptosis, but also evaluate caspase-6 as a potential therapeutic target for reducing bile acid-induced hepatocellular damage. Because activation of caspase-6 appears to be of importance for bile acid-induced apoptosis, but not for apoptosis induced by other stimuli, targeting caspase-6 might offer a better approach to selectively reduce bile acid-induced apoptotic liver injury. In the second part of this study we could demonstrate that GCDCA at moderate micromolar concentrations effectively induces apoptosis in two Fas-deficient human hepatoma cell lines suggesting that bile acid-induced apoptosis still occurs in the absence of this death receptor. In the past, bile acids such as GCDCA have been shown to induce hepatocyte apoptosis by a Fas death receptor-dependent mechanism (8Faubion W. Guicciardi M. Miyoshi H. Bronk S. Roberts P. Svingen P. Kaufmann S. Gores G. J. Clin. Investig... 1999; 103: 137-145Google Scholar, 29Reinehr R. Becker S. Hongen A. Haussinger D. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 23977-23987Google Scholar). In primary rat hepatocytes, GCDCA has been shown to first activate NADPH oxidase isoforms followed by generation of reactive oxygen species resulting in epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Fas (5Reinehr R. Graf D. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology.. 2003; 125: 839-853Google Scholar, 9Reinehr R. Becker S. Keitel V. Eberle A. Grether-Beck S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology.. 2005; 129: 2009-2031Google Scholar). However, hepatocyte apoptosis was also observed in the lpr bile duct-ligated mouse, which only has minimal Fas expression (30Miyoshi H. Rust C. Roberts P.J. Burgart L.J. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology.. 1999; 117: 669-677Google Scholar). Although hepatocyte apoptosis was diminished in this model of extrahepatic cholestasis, the rate of apoptosis increased over time suggesting that Fas-independent mechanisms of apoptosis were also occurring in these animals. Bile acids have also been postulated to cause direct mitochondrial cytotoxicity thereby activating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis (12Sokol R.J. Dahl R. Devereaux M.W. Yerushalmi B. Kobak G.E. Gumpricht E. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr... 2005; 41: 235-243Google Scholar, 31Sola S. Aranha M.M. Steer C.J. Rodrigues C.M. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol... 2007; 9: 123-138Google Scholar). Indeed, bile acids induced mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, and the mitochondrial permeability transition in primary rat hepatocytes (32Rodrigues C.M. Ma X. Linehan-Stieers C. Fan G. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Cell Death Differ.. 1999; 6: 842-854Google Scholar). Mitochondrial cytochrome c release is FADD/caspase-8-dependent during death receptor-mediated apoptosis of type II cells such as hepatocytes (33Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J.. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of FADD/caspase-8 signaling can help differentiate death receptor-associated versus direct mitochondrial dysfunction in type II. We therefore initially inhibited FADD using a dnFADD in an adenoviral vector to further establish the functional role of death receptors for bile acid-induced apoptosis in our model. Inhibition of FADD would not only block Fas-mediated, but also TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, which has also been shown to be involved in GCDCA-induced apoptosis (23Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N. Takimoto R. El-Deiry W. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 38610-38618Google Scholar). Interestingly, GCDCA still induced apoptosis in dnFADD-infected human hepatoma cells, although it was reduced by 50%. In contrast, TNFα-induced death receptor apoptosis was inhibited to control levels in the same experimental system. GCDCA-induced apoptosis has also been demonstrated to occur in the absence of FADD in primary rat hepatocytes (34Schoemaker M.H. Gommans W.M. de la Rosa L.C. Homan M. Klok P. Trautwein C. van Goor H. Poelstra K. Haisma H.J. Jansen P.L. Moshage H. J. Hepatol... 2003; 39: 153-161Google Scholar), therefore excluding a potential influence of the malignant transformation in the HepG2 hepatoma cells employed in our model. These results suggest that proapoptotic human bile acids like GCDCA at moderate micromolar concentrations representative of those found in cholestatic human liver injury are still capable to induce hepatocyte apoptosis in human and rodent hepatocytes by the intrinsic pathway when death receptor activation is inhibited. Because the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways can act independently to initiate apoptosis, bile acids most likely primarily activate death receptors as documented by various studies. When this fast extrinsic pathway is not available, toxic bile acids can induce apoptosis in hepatocytes by activating the intrinsic pathway as an escape mechanism, whereas this does not occur in pure death receptor signaling as exemplified by TNFα/actinomycin D-induced apoptosis. Thus, inhibition of death receptor signaling alone is probably not sufficient to reduce hepatocyte apoptosis and consecutive liver damage induced by toxic bile acids in cholestatic liver diseases. We thank Dr. Gregory Gores for helpful discussion of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1990898347,"In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) correlates with aggressiveness of tumors and poor survival. We employed a model of EMT based on immortalized p19ARF null hepatocytes (MIM), which display tumor growth upon expression of oncogenic Ras and undergo EMT through the synergism of Ras and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Here, we show that the interleukin-related protein interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI), a novel EMT-, tumor- and metastasis-inducing protein, cooperates with oncogenic Ras to cause TGF-β-independent EMT. Ras-transformed MIM hepatocytes overexpressing ILEI showed cytoplasmic E-cadherin, loss of ZO-1 and induction of α-smooth muscle actin as well as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF-R isoforms. As shown by dominant-negative PDGF-R expression in these cells, ILEI-induced PDGF signaling was required for enhanced cell migration, nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, nuclear pY-Stat3 and accelerated growth of lung metastases. In MIM hepatocytes expressing the Ras mutant V12-C40, ILEI collaborated with PI3K signaling resulting in tumor formation without EMT. Clinically, human HCC samples showed granular or cytoplasmic localization of ILEI correlating with well and poorly differentiated tumors, respectively. In conclusion, these data indicate that ILEI requires cooperation with oncogenic Ras to govern hepatocellular EMT through mechanisms involving PDGF-R/β-catenin and PDGF-R/Stat3 signaling."

In agreement with that finding, the binding region was mapped to amino acid positions 314-328 of D1 by applying a peptide-scanning approach. Approximately 10-20% of the soluble PratA factor was found to be associated with membranes in a D1-dependent manner. Sucrose density gradient centrifugations allowed the identification of a specific membrane subfraction that contains both PratA and D1 and which might represent a transfer and/or connecting region between plasma and thylakoid membrane.

Cyanobacterial PSII has been characterized in great detail at the structural level (1Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P.

However, much less is known about the stepwise biogenesis of this molecular machine, which contains at least 19 protein subunits as well as a complex set of cofactors (5Müller B. Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Dobakova M. Tichy M. Komenda J.

In the prokaryotic model organism Synechocystis PCC sp. 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803), several proteins have recently been identified that associate transiently with PSII, and inactivation of these leads to severe defects in PSII activity. Such proteins represent good candidates for putative assembly factors. The protein Slr1471p (OXA1/Alb3/YidC homologous), for instance, has been shown to interact directly with the D1 protein during integration of the latter into the thylakoid membrane (8Ossenbühl F. Inaba-Sulpice M. Meurer J. Soll J. Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2236-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The lumenal factor YCF48 (HCF136) is required for both efficient assembly and repair of PSII (9Plücken H. Müller B. Grohmann D. Westhoff P. Eichacker L.A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4044-4050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Finally, the 22-kDa Psb29 protein is apparently necessary for accurate biogenesis of the inner antennae of PSII (13Keren N. Ohkawa H. Welsh E.A. Liberton M. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2768-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the tetratricopeptide repeat protein PratA is involved in the biogenesis of PSII: loss of PratA function affects the maturation of the reaction-center protein D1 (14Klinkert B.

In almost all photoautotrophic organisms, D1 is synthesized as a precursor with a C-terminal extension that must be removed to allow assembly of the manganese cluster at the lumenal side of PSII. In Synechocystis 6803, this extension consists of 16 amino acids, which are processed in a two-step fashion (15Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Komenda J. Kuvikova S. Granvogel B. Eichacker L.A. Diner B.A. Nixon P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The precise contribution of the extension to photosynthetic performance is still under debate, but recent analyses of site-directed mutants have revealed that it has a photoprotective function (17Ivleva N.B. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Kuvikova S. Tichy M. Komenda J. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2005; 4: 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, PratA is a periplasmic protein that was previously shown to interact directly with the soluble C-terminal portion of D1 in yeast two-hybrid studies (19Fulda S. Huang F. Nilsson F. Hagemann M. Norling B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5900-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Klinkert B. Ossenbühl F. Sikorski M. Berry S. Eichacker L.A. Nickelsen J. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 2005; 69: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This finding strongly supports the idea that the early steps in photosystem biogenesis in cyanobacteria take place at the plasma membrane and not in the thylakoids (21Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6548-6553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, recent ultrastructural analyses have failed to unambiguously solve the long-standing question of whether or not a direct connection exists between plasma and thylakoid membranes; such a link would establish a continuum between the periplasm and the thylakoid lumen (23Van de Meene A.M.L.

Protoplasma. 2006; 227: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here, we report on the molecular details of the D1-PratA interaction. Based on two-hybrid studies in yeast and in vitro assays, we mapped the binding region of PratA on the D1 C terminus. Furthermore, we show that PratA forms part of a complex that also contains the D1 protein. Intriguingly, this complex is apparently not localized to the main thylakoid fraction but is enriched in a specific membrane subcompartment. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Protein interaction studies in yeast were performed using the MATCHMAKER LexA system (Clontech, see Ref. 14Klinkert B. Ossenbühl F. Sikorski M. Berry S. Eichacker L.A. Nickelsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44639-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cloning of the PratA gene (slr2048) into the yeast expression vector pJG4-5 and of a DNA fragment encoding the last 68 amino acids of the pD1 protein into pEG202 has been described previously (14Klinkert B. Ossenbühl F. Sikorski M. Berry S. Eichacker L.A. Nickelsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44639-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for the C-terminal segment of mD1, which lacks the 16-amino acid extension found in pD1, was amplified by PCR and subsequently inserted into pEG202 via primer-derived EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of the sequence encoding the C-terminal region of D1 was carried out using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). GST Pulldown Assays—GST pulldown assays were performed with recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. After amplification by PCR, the coding region of the PratA gene, excluding the transit sequence (14Klinkert B. Ossenbühl F. Sikorski M. Berry S. Eichacker L.A. Nickelsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44639-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the expression vector pGEX-4T-1. GST fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells. His-tagged PratA protein was produced in E. coli M15 cells (Qiagen) after PCR amplification of the same region and subsequent insertion into the SalI and PstI sites of the vector pQE31. Fragments encoding either the C-terminal segment of pD1 (68 amino acids) or mD1 (52 amino acids) were cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites in pGEX-4T-1. GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) for 3 h. The Sepharose beads were then incubated with a mixture of His-tagged PratA protein and GST protein alone for 1 h with gentle rotation, washed five times with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20) and finally resuspended in SDS loading buffer. After 10 min at 98 °C samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting. Peptide Scanning—To map the binding site(s) for PratA in the C-terminal portion of D1, pentadecameric peptides were synthesized (jpt Technologies, Berlin), which overlapped by 12 amino acids and covered the C-terminal 68 amino acids of pD1, and aliquots (5 nmol) of each were immobilized on a filter membrane (PepSpots™ membrane, jpt Technologies). Subsequently, the membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 20 μg of His-tagged-PratA protein. Bound PratA was localized using the αPratA antibody (25Reineke U. Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 243: 23-26PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane Isolation and Solubilization—For preparation of soluble and non-soluble protein fractions, equal amounts of wild-type and TD41 cells were harvested and resuspended in 500 μl of breaking buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl). Cells were then mechanically disrupted with glass beads (0.25-0.5 mm diameter) in a mini-bead-beater (Glen Mills), using three 20-s bursts. After centrifugation for 1 min at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was loaded onto a 1 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged for 30 min at 94,000 × g. The supernatant containing all soluble proteins was collected, and the pellet with membrane-bound proteins was resuspended in breaking buffer containing 5% Triton X-100. Finally the protein fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Membranes for solubilization assays (50 μg of protein) were prepared as described (26Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lunser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), sedimented by centrifugation and washed twice in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6. The samples were resuspended in 20-μl aliquots of HEPES buffer, to which 20 μl of 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6 (control), 0.2 m Na2CO3, 4 m urea, or 2 m NaCl was added. After a 30-min incubation on ice and centrifugation for 15 min with 18,000 × g at 4 °C the supernatants were collected and the pellets were washed twice in HEPES buffer. All samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Two-dimensional PAGE—For blue native (BN)-PAGE, membranes (500 μg of protein (26Dühring U. Irrgang K.D. Lunser K. Kehr J. Wilde A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) were sedimented by centrifugation (30 min, 15,000 × g, 4 °C) and resuspended in 50 μl of ACA buffer (750 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA). After addition of freshly prepared β-dodecylmaltoside (10% w/v) to a final concentration of 1.5% (w/v), membrane proteins were solubilized for 35 min on ice. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, 8 μl of 5% Coomassie solution (750 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue) was added to each supernatant, and the samples were loaded onto a 4.5-12% BN gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 50 V at 4 °C overnight, replacing the blue cathode buffer with fresh, colorless buffer a third of the way through the run, as described previously (27Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). For the second dimension, a single lane of the BN-PA gel was washed in solubilization buffer (66 mm Na2CO3, 2% SDS (w/v), 0.67% β-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min and then placed on top of a 12.5% SDS gel containing 4 m urea. Electrophoresis was carried out at 20 mA for 30 min and then at 4 mA overnight. Subsequently, gels were stained with Coomassie or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose-membranes and probed with various antibodies. For first-dimension colorless native (CN)-PAGE, Coomassie dye was omitted from samples and cathode buffer. Soluble proteins (500 μg) were mixed with 0.001% Ponceau S and electrophoretically separated as reported before (28Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Separation of Synechocystis Membranes—Equal amounts of cells from each strain in the early exponential growth phase were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min, washed with 5 mm Tris buffer, and resuspended in buffer I (10 mm Tris, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 600 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 0,2% lysozyme). The suspension was shaken for 2 h at 30 °C and subsequently washed twice in buffer II (20 mm Tris, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were disrupted by passing them twice through a French Press at 1200 p.s.i. DNase I (20 μl) was added, and, after incubation for 15 min at 4 °C, cell debris was sedimented at 4 °C (4500 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was adjusted to 50% sucrose by adding 80% sucrose in 10 mm Tris. A 10-ml sample of this solution was overlaid with 8 ml of 39% sucrose, 6 ml of 30% sucrose, and 8 ml of 10% sucrose (all in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 4 °C for 17 h at 135,000 × g the gradient was fractionated into five fractions containing 10% (I), 30% (II), or 50% (V) sucrose. The part containing 39% sucrose was divided into two separate fractions (III and IV) for obtaining a higher resolution in this region of the gradient. The samples were concentrated via ultrafiltration (Millipore) and then separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and finally probed with various antibodies. Fraction number V was diluted with 5 mm Tris buffer to a sucrose concentration of 20% and then centrifuged at 4 °C on a linear (30% to 60%) sucrose gradient for 17 h at 135,000 × g. After fractionation, proteins were subjected to immunodetection. Construction of Strains Expressing eCFP-D1 Fusion Proteins and Confocal Microscopy—For tagging the D1 protein with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (eCFP), both the promoter and the coding region of the psbA2 gene (slr1311) from Synechocystis 6803 were PCR separately amplified from wild-type genomic DNA. The eCFP coding region was amplified from plasmid p2GWC7 (29Karimi M. de Meyer B. Hilson P. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 103-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and inserted via appropriate primer-derived restriction sites into the N terminus of the psbA gene. The fusion gene was then inserted into the SmaI site of the conjugation vector pVZ322 (30Zinchenko V.V. Piven I.P. Melnik V.A. Shestakov S.V. Russ. J. Genet. 1999; 35: 228-232Google Scholar) giving rise to plasmid N-eCFP-D1. Wild-type and pratA mutant cells were each conjugated with this plasmid by following the protocol of (30Zinchenko V.V. Piven I.P. Melnik V.A. Shestakov S.V. Russ. J. Genet. 1999; 35: 228-232Google Scholar). Conjugants were then suspended in 0.3% Gelrite® (w/v) (Serva) and applied to coverslips for fluorescence microscopy. Confocal images were acquired with a TCS-SP5 confocal laser scanning system equipped with an inverted microscope (Leica) and an 63× glycerol immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.3). For the specific detection of eCFP and chlorophyll, excitation wavelengths were set to 480 nm and 670 nm, respectively. PratA Interacts with the Mature D1 Protein—We have previously shown that the soluble, periplasmic tetratricopeptide repeat protein PratA from Synechocystis 6803 is involved in the biogenesis of PSII (14Klinkert B.

The analysis of pulse-labeled proteins had suggested that the C-terminal processing of the reaction-center protein D1 is affected by a pratA mutation. In agreement with this finding, a direct interaction between the soluble C-terminal 68 amino acids of the D1 precursor (pD1) and PratA was documented using a yeast two-hybrid system (14Klinkert B.

To test whether PratA binding is specific for the precursor form of the D1 protein, we have now analyzed a version that lacks the C-terminal extension characteristic of the precursor using the same two-hybrid approach in yeast. As shown in Fig. 1A, PratA also recognizes the C-terminal segment of the mature D1 (mD1), suggesting that the 16-amino acid extension present in the precursor is not required for binding of PratA. Instead, the 52 amino acids retained in mD1 appear to contain the crucial determinants that mediate the D1-PratA interaction. Previous attempts to demonstrate this interaction using in vitro approaches yielded ambiguous results (14Klinkert B. Ossenbühl F. Sikorski M. Berry S. Eichacker L.A. Nickelsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44639-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, optimization of the conditions used for GST pulldown assays has now allowed us to confirm the specific interaction of the D1 protein and PratA also in vitro (Fig. 1B). Sepharose-bound GST alone failed to capture recombinant His-tagged PratA protein. In contrast, matrix-bound GST fused to the C-terminal portion of either the precursor or the mature D1 interacted with recombinant PratA, and PratA could subsequently be eluted from the matrix material under denaturing conditions (Fig. 1B). As a negative control, E. coli proteins from a strain containing no recombinant PratA protein were always analyzed in parallel. No signals were obtained in these cases. Taken together, the data thus strongly suggest that PratA specifically recognizes the C-terminal sequence that is common to pD1 and mD1. Mapping of the PratA Binding Region in the C-terminal Segment of D1—To determine the one or more regions that mediate this interaction, a peptide scan was performed based on immobilized, pentadecameric peptides with 12-amino acid overlaps and covering the entire C-terminal segment of pD1. Recombinant PratA protein was incubated with the PepSpots™ membrane bearing the whole peptide set, and subsequent decoration with the αPratA antibody revealed that PratA specifically binds to peptide No. 8, corresponding to positions 314-328 of the D1 protein (Fig. 2, A and B). Peptide No. 1 (positions 293-307) was also recognized by PratA, although the signal was less pronounced. We then analyzed mutant versions of the D1 C terminus that lacked either peptide 1 or 8 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Deletion of amino acids 293-307 had only a limited impact on yeast growth, suggesting that these positions make only a minor contribution, if any, to PratA-D1 complex formation (Fig. 2C). In contrast, when residues 314-328 were deleted, no interaction between PratA and the D1 segment was observed (Fig. 2C). This indicates that the region represented by peptide 8 indeed contains essential determinants that are strictly required for recognition of PratA. It is intriguing that, based on available structural data of crystallized PSII, this D1 region forms an α-helical structure (4Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). Furthermore, peptides 7 and 9, each of which overlaps peptide 8 by 12 amino acids, exhibited no detectable PratA binding at all, suggesting that the entire helix and/or its left and right borders are required for recognition by PratA. To substantiate this hypothesis, we replaced the threonine at position 316 with a glycine, because alignments of D1 sequences from various organisms revealed that Thr-316 is the only highly conserved amino acid at the left end (Ile-Gly-Thr) of the helix region. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indeed revealed that the T316G mutation is sufficient to prevent PratA binding completely (Fig. 2C). PratA Forms Part of Two Different Protein Complexes—Because an association with the D1 protein should result in a membrane localization of the otherwise soluble PratA protein, we measured the amounts of PratA present in soluble and membrane fractions of broken Synechocystis 6803 cells (Fig. 3A). In the wild-type, ∼10-20% of PratA was found to co-sediment with the membrane fraction in three independent experiments. In contrast, in the triple psbA deletion strain TD41, which fails to accumulate any D1 protein (31Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10589-10871Google Scholar), only minute amounts of PratA were found to be associated with membranes, supporting the idea of a PratA-D1 interaction (Fig. 3A). The nature of the membrane association of PratA was examined further by testing the effects of various potential solubilizing agents (Fig. 3B). Treatment of membranes with 1 m NaCl did not release PratA from the membrane, suggesting that non-ionic interactions play a crucial role for its localization. This was confirmed by the finding that 0.1 m Na2CO3 or 4 m urea was capable of solubilizing substantial amounts of PratA protein (Fig. 3B). To analyze the membrane-associated and soluble forms of PratA in more detail, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of protein subfractions was performed. When the membrane fraction was analyzed by two-dimensional BN-SDS-PAGE, PratA was detected together with unassembled D1 protein in the 70-kDa range (Fig. 4A). In addition, smaller amounts of PratA material formed a faint smear toward higher molecular mass regions (>100 kDa, Fig. 4A). However, various PSII core complexes, such as RCa, RC47, and RCC (32Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B.C. Dobakova M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), did not contain any detectable PratA protein. These data are consistent with the idea that a membrane-associated D1-PratA complex forms very early during the biogenesis of PSII. When the TD41 strain was similarly analyzed, no PratA protein was detected in the membrane fraction, again indicating that the membrane association of PratA is solely mediated via the D1 protein (Fig. 4A, compare also Fig. 3B). Two-dimensional CN-SDS-PAGE of soluble proteins from the two strains revealed a different picture (Fig. 4B). In wild-type cells, the soluble PratA form is found in a complex of ∼200 kDa. Subsequent analysis of the psbA deletion strain TD41 revealed that neither the size nor the amount of this complex is altered in the absence of the D1 protein (Fig. 4B). This is in striking contrast to the behavior of the smaller, membrane-associated complex. Thus, two PratA complexes that differ in size and localization exist in Synechocystis cells. Whether these complexes are functionally related remains to be elucidated. Repeated attempts to immunoprecipitate the PratA-D1 complex were initiated to confirm its presence in vivo. However, presumably due to the low abundance of the complex, evidence for the presence of neither PratA nor D1 in various precipitates remained equivocal (data not shown). The PratA-D1 Complex Is Localized to a Membrane Subcompartment—All the data presented above strongly suggest that a PratA-D1 complex is formed in vitro and in vivo. But is this complex associated with the plasma membrane or the thylakoid membrane system in Synechocystis 6803? To answer this question, we employed sucrose density gradient centrifugation to separate the two membrane types. Initial centrifugation through a step gradient allowed the partial purification of the plasma membrane, as judged by the immunodetection of the plasma membrane marker NrtA (Fig. 5A). However, NrtA was detectable in all fractions, including that containing the thylakoid membranes (Fig. 5A, fraction V). This indicates that the latter one is still significantly contaminated with plasma membrane material. PratA was mainly found in fraction II and in the thylakoid fraction V, whereas D1 was only detectable in fraction V, even after overexposure of films. We did not further analyze the PratA-containing fraction II, because the main focus of the work was on the characterization of the native D1-PratA complex, which must be localized in the crude thylakoid fraction V of the gradient. To further resolve the membrane mixture present in this fraction, it was subjected to a second centrifugation through a linear 30% to 60% sucrose gradient (Fig. 5B). This resulted in a clear separation of PratA (Fig. 5B, fractions 1-6) from the chlorophyll-containing thylakoid membrane fractions, which contained most of the mature mD1 protein (Fig. 5B, fractions 7-14). In contrast to mD1, the precursor pD1 protein exhibited a different distribution on the linear sucrose gradient. Roughly similar amounts of pD1 were detected in the PratA-containing fractions 3-7 and the thylakoid fractions 11-13. The inner antenna protein PsbB was identified only in thylakoid fractions 7-14. However, due to the lower sensitivity of the antibody used, we cannot exclude the possibility that minor amounts of PsbB are also present in fractions 1-6. Hence, the data strongly suggest that PratA is not associated with thylakoid membranes per se, but rather with a distinct membrane subfraction, which co-migrates with thylakoids during centrifugation through the step gradient (Fig. 5A). NrtA again showed a distribution throughout the whole gradient (Fig. 5B). It remains unclear whether this really reflects the sedimentation of the plasma membrane or might represent a special feature of NrtA during sucrose gradient centrifugation. However, no absolute co-fractionation of PratA and neither NrtA nor PsbB was observed in these experiments strongly suggesting that PratA marks a specific membrane subcompartment of Synechocystis 6803 cells. To answer the question whether the PratA form in fractions 1-6 of the linear gradient indeed represents the membrane-associated one two-dimensional-BN-SDS-PAGE was carried out on material from fraction 1 (Fig. 5B). The results demonstrated that indeed the smaller membrane-associated PratA complex of 70 kDa was present in this fraction (Fig. 5C). When membranes from the pratA mutant were fractionated in the same way, a moderate but significant shift of mD1 material toward the top of the gradient was observed (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 4-7 from WT and pratA). In contrast, both NrtA and PsbB exhibited the same sedimentation behaviors irrespective of its source. The latter finding indicates that only a PSII subfraction that does not contain appreciable amounts of PsbB is affected by the pratA mutation. The strongest impa"
https://openalex.org/W2029764594,"Transcriptional control of Runx2 gene expression through two alternative promoters (P1 and P2) is critical for the execution of its function as an osteogenic cell fate determining factor. In all vertebrates examined to date, the bone related P1 promoter contains a purine-rich region (-303 to -128 bp in the rat) that separates two regulatory domains. The length of this region differs dramatically between species even within the same order. Using deletion analysis, we show that part of this purine-rich region (-200 to -128) containing a duplicated element (Y-repeat) positively regulates Runx2 P1 transcription. Electrophoretic mobility assays and chromatin immunoprecipitations reveal that Y-repeat binds at least two different classes of transcription factors related to GC box binding proteins (e.g. SP1 and SP7/Osterix) and ETS-like factors (e.g. ETS1 and ELK1). Forced expression of SP1 increases Runx2 P1 promoter activity through the Y-repeats, and small interfering RNA depletion of SP1 decreases Runx2 expression. Similarly, exogenous expression of wild type ELK1, but not a defective mutant that cannot be phosphorylated, enhances Runx2 gene expression. SP1 is most abundant in proliferating cells, and ELK1 is most abundant in postconfluent cells; during MC3T3-E1 osteoblast differentiation, both proteins are transiently co-expressed when Runx2 expression is enhanced. Taken together, our data suggest that basal Runx2 gene transcription is regulated by dynamic interactions between SP1 and ETS-like factors during progression of osteogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2094703571,"Background In the present study, synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and Cryo-TEM were used to characterize the temperature-induced structural transitions of monoelaidin (ME) aqueous dispersion in the presence of the polymeric stabilizer F127. We prove that the direct transition from vesicles to cubosomes by heating this dispersion is possible. The obtained results were compared with the fully hydrated bulk ME phase. Methodology/Principal Findings Our results indicate the formation of ME dispersion, which is less stable than that based on the congener monoolein (MO). In addition, the temperature-dependence behavior significantly differs from the fully hydrated bulk phase. SAXS findings indicate a direct Lα-V2 internal transition in the dispersion. While the transition temperature is conserved in the dispersion, the formed cubosomes with internal Im3m symmetry clearly contain more water and this ordered interior is retained over a wider temperature range as compared to its fully hydrated bulk system. At 25°C, Cryo-TEM observations reveal the formation of most likely closely packed onion-like vesicles. Above the lamellar to non-lamellar phase transition at 65°C, flattened cubosomes with an internal nanostructure are observed. However, they have only arbitrary shapes and thus, their morphology is significantly different from that of the well-shaped analogous MO cubosome and hexosome particles. Conclusions/Significance Our study reveals a direct liposomes-cubosomes transition in ME dispersion. The obtained results suggest that the polymeric stabilizer F127 especially plays a significant role in the membrane fusion processes. F127 incorporates in considerable amount into the internal nanostructure and leads to the formation of a highly swollen Im3m phase."

The BAR domain of ASAP1 is critical for in vivo function of ASAP1, but the molecular functions of the BAR domain of ASAP1 have not been extensively characterized. Hypotheses related to membrane curvature have been examined. Recombinant ASAP1 can induce the formation of tubules from large unilamellar vesicles, which may be related to a function of ASAP1 in membrane traffic. The BAR domain might also regulate GAP activity of ASAP1. We have considered two mechanisms based on the known properties of BAR domains. First the BAR domain could regulate association of ASAP1 with membrane surfaces containing the substrate Arf1·GTP. The BAR domain could also affect GAP activity through an intramolecular association. In one BAR-PH protein that has been crystallized (APPL1), the two domains fold together to form a protein binding site (9Zhu G.Y. Chen J. Liu J. Brunzelle J.S. Huang B. Wakeham N. Terzyan S. Li X.M.

In lipid binding assays, we used LUVs containing molar ratios of either 40% phosphatidylcholine (PC), 25% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 15% phosphatidylserine (PS), 9.5% phosphatidylinositol (PI), 0.5% PIP2, and 10% cholesterol (+PS LUV) or 55% PC, 25% PE, 9.5% PI, 0.5% PIP2, and 10% cholesterol (-PS LUV). In fixed time point (3-min) GAP assays, we used LUVs containing 55% egg PC or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), 20% PE, 15% PS, 7.5% PI, and 2.5% PIP2. The lipid mixtures were extruded through 1- or 0.1-μm pore filters. Single turnover and steady state kinetics were performed using LUVs containing 55% DSPC, 20% PE, 15% PS, 7.5% PI, and 2.5% PIP2. The lipid mixtures were extruded through 0.1-μm pore filters. GAP Assays and Kinetic Analysis—The conversion of Arf1·GTP to Arf1·GDP was followed in one of two ways (26Che M.M. Nie Z.Z. Randazzo P.A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In fixed time point assays and in single turnover kinetics, [α-32P]GTP bound to Arf1 was used as a substrate, and the conversion of protein bound [α-32P]GTP to [α-32P]GDP was measured. To determine initial rates for saturation kinetics, tryptophan fluorescence of Arf1 was monitored. Arf1·GTP has a greater quantum yield than does Arf1·GDP. Fixed time point assays were used to determine the amount of ASAP1 required to hydrolyze 50% of the Arf bound GTP in 3 min, which we refer to as the C50 (26Che M.M. Nie Z.Z. Randazzo P.A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Randazzo P.A. Miura K. Jackson T.R. Method Enzymol. 2001; 329: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Either PZA or BAR-PZA was titrated into the reaction containing myrArf1·GTP as the substrate. Reactions were stopped after 3 min by adding 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein-bound nucleotide was trapped on nitrocellulose, eluted with formic acid, and separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose. In these experiments, only protein-bound GTP was analyzed. Steady state kinetics was performed with a FluorMax3 spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon Horiba, Edison, NJ) (24Luo R. Ahvazi B. Amariei D. Shroder D. Burrola B. Losert W. Randazzo P.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Che M.M. Nie Z.Z. Randazzo P.A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using 0.03 nm PZA or 0.5 nm BAR-PZA as enzyme and 0.25–15 μm myrArf1·GTP as substrate. The reaction contained 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm GTP, and 500 μm LUVs. The excitation wavelength was 297 nm, and the emission wavelength was 340 nm. Fluorescence was recorded every 10 s. Initial rates were determined from the progress curves. The single turnover assay and other rapid kinetic analyses were performed using an RQF-3 rapid chemical quench flow instrument (KinTek, Austin, TX) (24Luo R. Ahvazi B. Amariei D. Shroder D. Burrola B. Losert W. Randazzo P.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MyrArf1 (3 μm) incubated with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.125 nm [α-32P]GTP, and 500 μm LUVs for 60 min was used as the substrate. For experiments in which substrate was in excess of enzyme, 10 μm myrArf1 was incubated with 20 μm GTP to form Arf1·GTP. PZA (0.47–3.76 μm final concentration) or BAR-PZA (0.27–8.7 μm final concentration) with 500 μm LUVs was rapidly mixed with Arf1·GTP at 30 °C. The reaction was quenched with 3 m formic acid after 2–250 ms. GTP and GDP in the quenched reaction were separated by thin layer chromatography. In these experiments, unlike that used to determine C50, the protein-bound GTP was not separated from the free GTP. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectral Analysis—CD spectra were collected using a Jasco J720 CD spectropolarimeter for ASAP1 proteins. When collecting CD spectra of PZA, PH, ZA, and PH plus ZA, each protein was diluted to 2 μm in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. When collecting CD spectra of BAR-PZA, BAR-PH, ZA, and BAR-PH plus ZA, each protein was diluted to 4 μm in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) to prevent the BAR-PZA from precipitating out of the solution. Dynamic Light Scattering—Light scattering data were acquired at 90° at a wavelength of 633 nm and correlated with a BI-9000 AT autocorrelator (Brookhaven Instruments, Holtsville, NY). Data analysis was performed by modeling with particle size distributions with the maximum entropy method (30Livesay A.K. Licinio P. Delaye M. J. Chem. Phys. 1986; 84: 5102-5107Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar) as implemented in the software SEDFIT (31Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). The decay time is a measure of both diffusion (size-dependent) as well as rotation and other mechanical fluctuations. For particles larger than the wavelength of laser light used, multiple scattering events further complicate the quantitative interpretation toward Stokes radii. This is why we do not quantify the radii, but from the similarity of the autocorrelation functions we can conclude that the size-dependent translational diffusion and other mechanical movements are very similar. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Sedimentation Velocity— Stock samples of BAR-PZA (6.7 μm), BAR-PH (14.1 μm), PZA (22.4 μm), and ZA (31.8 μm), purified by size exclusion with Sephacryl columns (GE Healthcare) in 200 mm K2PO4, pH 7.0, were used to prepare experimental samples at several different loading concentrations by serial dilution using the respective size exclusion chromatography running column buffer. The density (1.0238 g/ml) and viscosity (1.0759 centipoises) of the buffer were determined using a DMA5000 Density Meter (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) and an AMVn Automated Micro Viscometer (Anton Paar), respectively. The protein partial specific volumes were determined to be 0.7334 ml/g (BAR-PZA), 0.7330 ml/g (BAR-PH), 0.7331 ml/g (PZA), and 0.7338 ml/g (ZA) from the amino acid sequence using the software SEDNTERP. 400-μl samples were loaded into 12-mm path length double sector cells and were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm at 20 °C in a ProteomeLab-XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA) following the standard protocol. The evolution of the resulting concentration gradient was monitored by both the absorbance optics (280 nm) and the interference detection system. Sedimentation coefficients for the protein constructs were obtained from the analysis of the sedimentation velocity data using the software SEDFIT. For this analysis, an average of 30 scans were loaded and modeled with a continuous c(s) distribution using a resolution of 200 s-values between 0.2 to 8.0 S and maximum entropy regularization (p = 0.68) (31Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). From the superposition of c(s) distributions obtained at different loading concentrations, the absence of concentration-dependent interactions was verified, and the ideal sedimentation was confirmed by obtaining molar mass estimates from c(s) close to the theoretical molar masses of the respective protein species. The s-value of the protein species was determined as the weight average sedimentation coefficient of the peak. The sequence molar mass and the measured sedimentation coefficient were utilized as input parameters in the program SEDNTERP to calculate values for the respective protein frictional ratio. Axial dimensions were calculated using a cylinder model assuming a hydration of 0.3 g/g. For calculating the hydrodynamic properties of the homology models, Protein Data Bank files were loaded into the modeling software Hydropro (version 7) (32de la Torre J.G. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Homology Modeling—The homology model of the ASAP1-(1–431) BAR-PH construct was generated using the APPL1 BAR/PH x-ray structure (Protein Data Bank code 2Q13) (9Zhu G.Y. Chen J. Liu J. Brunzelle J.S. Huang B. Wakeham N. Terzyan S. Li X.M. Rao Z. Li G.P. Zhang X.J.C. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3484-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with the Prime program (Schrödinger Inc., New York, NY) with N and C termini sequences (including the His tag sequence) beyond the x-ray structure generated in random coil conformations. The model was first generated with Prime as a monomer, superposed on the x-ray structure dimer, and minimized holding non-insert, non-termini backbone atoms fixed using the MacroModel program (Schrödinger Inc.). The model for ASAP1-(1–724) BAR-PZA construct was generated by superposing PH domain residues 340–430 of the representative structure from the ensemble of PZA structures from Luo et al. (33Luo R. Miller Jenkins L.M. Randazzo P.A. Gruschus J. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) onto the PH domain of the ASAP1-(1–431) BAR-PH homology model monomer. Residues beyond position 310 for BAR-PH and before position 330 for PZA were removed, and the BAR-PH linker was regenerated using Prime as well as the C terminus His tag of the BAR-PZA construct. The result was superposed using the BAR-PH model as template to form the BAR-PZA dimer, and the structure was minimized using MacroModel with the non-linker, non-termini backbone atoms fixed. Secondary structure consensus predictions were performed using [email protected] (34Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). To provide hypothetical sedimentation coefficients for the BAR-PH and BAR-PZA in conformations with no interdomain contacts, additional model structures were generated. The BAR, PH, and ZA linkers were first deleted, and the domains were displaced to a 10-Å minimum separation between domains and rotated to bring the domain termini to within 15-Å separation using Maestro (Schrödinger Inc.). The linker regions were then rebuilt using Prime. Electron Microscopy—For negative stained images, a carbon-coated electron microscopy grid was placed on a 10-μl sample drop for 2 min, blotted with filter paper, chemically stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 2 min, blotted again, and air-dried. Negative stained specimens were examined in a transmission electron microscope (Philips CM120, FEI Co.) operated at 100 kV. Images were recorded digitally on a 794 Gatan MultiScan charge-coupled device camera with the DigitalMicrograph software package (35Danino D. Moon K.-H. Hinshaw J.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The experiments described here use recombinant proteins derived from ASAP1 that are represented schematically in Fig. 1A. The nomenclature we use for the recombinant proteins refers to the domain structure: the protein composed of the BAR and PH domains is called BAR-PH, the protein composed of the BAR, PH, Arf GAP, and Ank repeat domains is called BAR-PZA, the protein composed of the PH, Arf GAP, and Ank repeat domains is called PZA, and the protein composed of the Arf GAP and Ank repeat domains is called ZA. Homology Modeling of ASAP1—The model of BAR-PH constructed using the x-ray structure of the homologous APPL1 (Fig. 1B) shows contacts between the BAR and PH domains in three regions. The loop between helices 2 and 3 of the BAR domain (ASAP1 residues 182–206) from one chain of the dimer packs against the PH domain of the other chain between β strands 5 and 6 (around residue 396) and the N-terminal end of the C-terminal helix (around residue 415). The linker region between the BAR and PH domains (residues 300–330) is 21 residues longer than the corresponding linker in the APPL1 structure. Although homology modeling does provide for insertions, the predicted structure for the additional linker residues is necessarily more speculative. A consensus of secondary structure prediction algorithms (34Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar) predicts the additional linker residues to be in random coil conformation consistent with the homology model. The third contact between the BAR and PH domains occurs between the BAR N-terminal residues of one chain and the loop between strands 3 and 4 of the PH domain (around residue 375) of the other chain. This loop forms part of the phosphoinositide binding site of the PH domain. ASAP1 contains 26 additional N-terminal residues compared with APPL1. As with the insertion in the BAR-PH linker, the additional residues of the N terminus are represented by random coil in the model. Secondary structure prediction algorithms predict an α helix not present in APPL1 that includes part of the additional N-terminal residues (ASAP1 residues 15–32). This putative helix would be located such that it could pack against part of the BAR domain, or it could interact with the PH domain in or near its phosphoinositide binding site. The Arf GAP and Ank repeat (ZA) domain portion of the ASAP1-(1–724) BAR-PZA construct was modeled by taking the member nearest the average of the ensemble of PZA structures previously generated based on NMR, analytical ultracentrifugation, chemical protection, and mutagenesis data (33Luo R. Miller Jenkins L.M. Randazzo P.A. Gruschus J. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and superposing the PH domain onto the PH domain of the BAR-PH homology model. The resulting model shows no contact between residues of the BAR domain analogous to APPL1 and the Arf GAP/Ank repeat domains. However, contact between the Arf GAP and Ank repeat domains and the additional N-terminal extension of the BAR domain could possibly occur if the additional residues adopt a relatively extended conformation. The linker between BAR and PH domains lies near the PH-ZA linker, and contacts between the additional BAR-PH linker residues and PH-ZA linker could also occur. The NMR data on the PZA construct indicated that the PH and ZA domains interact dynamically in an ensemble of contacts. If a similar dynamic interaction occurs in the BAR-PZA construct, then for some members of the ensemble, then possible N terminus to ZA domain or BAR-PH to PH-ZA linker contacts could be more likely. Limited Proteolysis—We examined the structural relationship between the BAR, PH, and Arf GAP domains using limited proteolysis of BAR-PH, BAR-PZA, and PZA. Trypsin was titrated into a fixed time reaction, and the proteolytic products were examined by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). The most sensitive cleavage site, affected by 1 ng of trypsin in a 25-μl reaction under these conditions, was between the BAR and PH domains consistent with a flexible linker between the two domains that was predicted from the homology modeling. The BAR fragment had additional cleavage sites apparent with 2–10 ng of trypsin. The fragment containing the PH, Arf GAP, and Ank repeat domains was less sensitive. Cleavage of the fragment generated from BAR-PZA or of recombinant PZA was observed with 50 ng of trypsin and occurred between the PH and Arf GAP domains (Fig. 2A and Ref. 25Kam J.L. Miura K.

https://openalex.org/W2101013582,"We recently established the critical role of the PTEN/MAGI-1b signalosome in stabilization of cell-cell contacts and suppression of invasiveness. The PTEN tumor suppressor is recruited to E-cadherin junctional complexes through the binding to the second PDZ domain of the MAGI-1b scaffolding molecule, whereas beta-catenin interacts with the fifth PDZ domain. To identify additional effectors of this signalosome, we used yeast 2-hybrid screening. Among the clones identified, we focused on TRIP6, which belongs to the zyxin family of proteins. We demonstrated that TRIP6 interacted directly with MAGI-1b by binding to its fifth PDZ domain. Ectopic expression of TRIP6 induced invasiveness in the epithelial MDCK and MDCKts-src cells in a PI3-kinase- and a NF-kappaB-dependent manner and impaired cell-cell aggregation at least in part by uncoupling adherens junctional complexes from the cytoskeleton. The TRIP6Stop473 mutant, which lacks the PDZ binding motif, was still able to increase NF-kappaB and Akt activities but did not promote invasiveness or interfere with cell-cell aggregation. Intracellular delivery of competing peptides corresponding to TRIP6 or beta-catenin C terminus restored invasive properties in MDCKts-src TRIP6Stop473 cells, highlighting the requirement of PDZ scaffolds in junctional complexes activity. TRIP6 overexpression in colon tumors suggest its critical role in cancer progression."

Maintenance and growth of mitochondria depend on the constitutive import of newly synthesized proteins that are encoded by nuclear DNA, translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes as precursors and eventually taken up from the cytosol. The latter process is mediated by several complex sorting and import machineries, protein translocases, and insertases that are located in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 2Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Annu. Rev.

EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The port of entry for almost all of the precursor proteins is the TOM (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane) complex. Once the precursor protein has started to cross the outer membrane through the TOM complex, sorting signals trigger transport to its final destination, a process facilitated by one of the various import complexes (2Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 4Pfanner N. Curr.

The TIM23 complex can be distinguished into two functionally defined parts: a core complex comprised of integral membrane proteins whose subunits are firmly associated with the membrane and the import motor. The core complex comprises three essential proteins: Tim17, Tim23, and Tim50, which make up the receptors and the translocation channel of the complex. Initial translocation of the N-terminal presequence across the inner membrane requires the membrane potential ΔΨ. Completion of translocation across the inner membrane, however, requires the action of the import motor (2Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Annu. Rev.

Finally, two nonessential membrane proteins, Pam17 and Tim21, modulate the activity of the TIM23 complex in an antagonistic manner.

Using in vivo chemical cross-linking, two regions on Tim23 were recently identified that mediate interaction with Tim50. The first one lies in the N-terminal domain, and the second one lies in the first transmembrane helix (24Alder N.N. Sutherland J. Buhring A.I. Jensen R.E. Johnson A.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).We set out to reconstitute the interaction between Tim23 and Tim50 in vitro. We prepared recombinant purified intermembrane space domains of two proteins and studied their interaction by cross-linking and surface plasmon resonance measurements. Also, we identified mutations in Tim23 that abolished its interaction with Tim50. Mitochondria harboring Tim23 with these mutations were deprived in their ability to import precursor proteins via the TIM23 complex. This is the first study to reconstitute the Tim23-Tim50 interaction in vitro from recombinant proteins and to identify specific residues on Tim23 that are essential for it.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Proteinase K (P-6556), V8 proteinase (P-2922), and DNase (D-5025) were purchased from Sigma. Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS; 21555) was from Pierce, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (13625900) was from Roche Applied Science.Construction of NusA-Tim23IMS and NusA-Tim50IMS—The sequences encoding the soluble domains of yeast Tim23 (amino acids 1-96) and Tim50 (amino acids 133-476) were amplified by PCR, with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA as a template and the primers listed in Table 1. The PCR products were cloned into a modified pET-43.1a(+) vector containing octahistidine-tagged NusA protein (25Davis G.D. Elisee C. Newham D.M. Harrison R.G. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 65: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Joel Hirsch) and a cleavage site for the TEV protease. The construct was engineered in such a way that the histidine tag and NusA were removed upon TEV protease treatment. The Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was used as a host for the expression of NusA-Tim23IMS or NusA-Tim50IMS fusion proteins.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyTim50IMSGGATCCATGAGGGATTGGGAGCCTCAAGGAATTCTTATTTGGATTCAGCAATCTTCTim23IMS (wild type)GGATCCATGTCGTGGCTTTTTGGAGGAATTCCAGTCATCGGTCCACCCACGGTim23IMS (P60A)ACCGCTAGGCTGCATGCGTTGGCTGGTCTAGACGTCTAGACCAGCCAACGCATGCAGCCTAGCGGTTim23IMS (D65A)CATCCTTTGGCTGGTCTAGCAAAGGGTGTGGAGTATTTAGCTAAATACTCCACACCCTTTGCTAGACCAGCCAAAGGATGTim23IMS (K66A)CTTTGGCTGGTCTAGACGCAGGTGTGGAGTATTTAGCTAAATACTCCACACCTGCGTCTAGACCAGCCAAAGTim23IMS (Y70A)GACAAGGGTGTGGAGGCTTTAGATCTGGAAGCTTCCAGATCTAAAGCCTCCACACCCTTGTCTim23IMS (L71A)CAAGGGTGTGGAGTATGCAGATCTGGAAGAAGAACGTTCTTCTTCCAGATCTGCATACTCCACACCCTTGTim23IMS (G83A)CCTCGTTAGAAGCCTCACAGGGTCTGCAACCCTGTGAGGCTTCTAACGAGGTim23IMS (R91A)GGTCTGATCCCTTCCGCTGGGTGGACCGATGACCGGTCATCGGTCCACCCAGCGGAAGGGATCAGACCTim23IMS (D95A)CCTTCCCGTGGGTGGACCGCTGACCTATGTTACGGCCGTAACATAGGTCAGCGGTCCACCCACGGGAAGGTim23IMS (Y70L71AA)GTCTAGACAAGGGTGTGGAGGCAGCAGATCTGGAAGAAGAACAACGTTGTTCTTCTTCCAGATCTGCTGCCTCCACACCCTTGTCTAGAC Open table in a new tab Purification of Tim23IMS and Tim50IMS—Bacteria were grown for ∼3 h at 37°C in 6 L of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Upon reaching an A600 of 0.6, the temperature was lowered to 16 °C, and protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside overnight. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min and homogenized in 60 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05 mg/ml lysozyme, 45 mg/ml DNase, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one tablet of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. After incubation for 15 min on ice, the bacteria were disrupted using a microfluidizer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (20 ml) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). The column was washed with three volumes of buffer A until a stable base line was reached. The fractions were eluted with a linear gradient (0–50%, 90 ml) of buffer B (buffer A containing 1 m imidazole). The fractions enriched with the protein were pooled and treated with TEV protease (TEV:protein, 1:40 w/w) overnight at 4 °C in a dialysis bag against 5 liters of buffer A. The protein was then passed over a second nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column to remove in one step the TEV protease, which contained an uncleavable octahistidine tag, NusA, which remained after digestion of the fusion protein and also contained the histidine tag, along with the nondigested material and nonspecifically bound proteins. Fractions enriched with the desired protein were concentrated and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (total bead volume, 90 ml; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions with the desired protein were concentrated using Vivaspin protein concentrators (Vivascience; molecular weight cut-off of 5,000 for Tim23IMS and 10,000 for Tim50IMS), divided into aliquots, and flash-frozen in liquid N2. All of the purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C.Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutants were created according to the protocol of Stratagene, using the primers listed in Table 1.Circular Dichroism—All of the CD measurements were carried out with an Aviv CD spectrometer model 202 over the range of 260-190 nm at a scan rate of 1 nm/s, using a cell with a path length of 0.1 mm. Each spectrum is an average of five scans. The raw data were corrected by subtracting the contribution of the buffer to the CD signal. The data were smoothed and converted to molar ellipticity units. The measurements were taken at a constant temperature of 25 °C in buffer containing 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol, with a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml.Thermal Aggregation Assay for Tim23IMS and Tim50IMS—Aliquots (0.4 mg/ml) of Tim23IMS or Tim50IMS in 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol were incubated at different temperatures for 15 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature to obtain aggregated (pellet) and soluble (supernatant) fractions. The proteins in each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB).Limited Proteolysis of Tim23IMS and Tim50IMS—V8 Protease (0.01 mg/ml) was used to digest 0.2 mg/ml Tim23IMS or Tim50IMS. PK (0.2 μg/ml) was added to 0.4 mg/ml protein. The reactions were allowed to proceed on ice in 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, and 200 mm NaCl. Time-dependent proteolysis of proteins was followed by SDS-PAGE and CBB staining.Cross-linking Experiments—Cross-linking reactions were carried out with 1 mm DSS at room temperature for 1 h in 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol at a protein concentration of 10 μm. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-containing sample buffer. The cross-linked products were separated by SDS-PAGE using a gradient of 8–16% acrylamide and stained with CBB.Surface Plasmon Resonance—The experiments were performed with a ProteOn XPR36 instrument (Bio-Rad). This system uses an SPR-based detector to monitor formation of complexes between analytes and ligand molecules. The sensor chip (GLC) was activated for 80 s with a mixture of 0.1 m EDC and 0.025 m sulfo-NHS (TS-Pierce). Immediately after activation, 20 μg of Tim23IMS (wild type or mutant) in 1 volume of buffer C (20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.001% Tween) were diluted with 4 volumes of buffer D (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.5) and injected across channel/s (400 s at a flow rate of 30 μl/min). One channel, which was treated with the buffer without protein, served as a reference. Finally, the channels were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.5, for 200 s. Tim23IMS was coupled at response levels of ∼800 RU in a channel. The chip was rotated at 90°, the channels were washed for 30 min with buffer C, and six different concentrations of Tim50IMS were simultaneously injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for an association phase of 200 s, which was followed by a 600-s dissociation phase.Yeast Strains and Media—Wild type yeast strain YPH499 was used (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate the strain containing a chromosomal deletion of TIM23 rescued with Tim23 on URA plasmid, YPH499 cells were transformed with pVT-U plasmid (27Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) carrying the wild type copy of Tim23 under the control of the ADH promoter. The chromosomal copy of TIM23 was subsequently deleted by the KAN cassette using homologous recombination. This strain was designated Δ23 + 23URA. To generate yeast strains carrying mutant versions of Tim23 instead of wild type, Tim23 mutants were cloned into centromeric plasmid pRS315 (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under control of the endogenous promoter and 3′-untranslated region and transformed into Δ23 + 23URA. An empty pRS315 and the plasmid carrying the wild type copy of Tim23 were transformed as controls. Yeast cells that had lost the URA plasmid were selected on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid.Yeast cells were normally grown on lactate medium containing 0.1% (w/v) glucose at 30 °C. To exclude possible secondary effects, for import assays yeast cells were grown at 24 °C. For drop dilution assays, 10-fold serial dilutions of yeast cells were spotted on YPG plates and incubated at 24, 30, and 37 °C for 2 days.Miscellaneous—Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed according to published procedures (11Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Import into isolated mitochondria was done as described previously (11Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) with the modification that mitochondria were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition of radiolabeled precursor proteins.RESULTSProperties of Purified Tim23IMS and Tim50IMS—We purified the soluble intermembrane space domains of Tim23 and Tim50 after expression in E. coli. (Fig. 1A). Their secondary structure was determined by CD spectroscopy. The spectrum of Tim50IMS showed that it was folded with a high content of α-helices and β-sheets (Fig. 1B). Tim23IMS yielded a spectrum indicative of an unstructured protein; however, there were also indications of the presence of some structured elements (Fig. 1C). Protease digestion experiments (supplemental Fig. S1) confirmed that Tim50IMS is a tightly folded protein, whereas Tim23IMS is largely unstructured. Interestingly, programs that predict secondary structures on the basis of primary sequences suggest ∼85% of the IMS domain of Tim23 to be unstructured (supplemental Fig. S2).Next we examined the stability of the purified IMS domains. The thermal stability of both proteins was assessed by following their denaturation. Aggregation of Tim50IMS started at 50 °C and was complete at 60 °C (Fig. 1D). Thermal denaturation was also followed by recording the CD spectrum at 222 nm. A Tm value of 52.5 °C was measured (supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, Tim23IMS did not aggregate but remained completely soluble at all temperatures examined (up to 80 °C) (Fig. 1E). The CD spectrum of Tim23IMS remained unchanged even at temperatures as high as 80 °C (not shown). In summary, the isolated Tim50IMS protein was folded with a well defined secondary structure. In contrast, Tim23IMS appeared to be essentially unstructured.Reconstitution of Tim23-Tim50 Interaction Using Purified Tim23IMS and Tim50IMS—To detect an interaction between the isolated Tim23IMS and Tim50IMS domains, we used two methods. First, they were incubated, separately or together, with the cross-linking agent DSS. The cross-linked adducts were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. With Tim23IMS no cross-linked species were observed (Fig. 2). In contrast, Tim50IMS, after exposure to DSS, yielded a pattern comprising not only monomers but also dimers and higher oligomers (Fig. 2). Incubation of Tim23IMS in the presence of DSS and increasing concentrations of Tim50IMS led to the formation of a cross-linked product, which corresponded in size to an adduct of the two proteins. This was confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies raised against both proteins (not shown). The same result was obtained when the concentration of Tim50IMS was kept constant (10 μm), and the concentration of Tim23IMS was increased (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Complex formation of the isolated intermembrane space domains of Tim50 and Tim23 detected by chemical cross-linking. A, purified Tim23IMS (10 μm) was incubated for 10 min with increasing concentrations of purified Tim50IMS and then for 1 h with 1 mm DSS at 25 °C. B, purified Tim50IMS (10 μm) was incubated with increasing amounts of Tim23IMS and treated as in A. Cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with CBB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Concentration-dependent complex formation between Tim23IMS and Tim50IMS was also observed using surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 3A). Dissociation of the complex occurred upon washing with buffer. The KD of the interaction of Tim23IMS and Tim50IMS, calculated from the maximal SPR signal as a function of the concentrations, was 60 μm (Fig. 3B). In summary, interaction of the purified IMS domains of Tim23 and Tim50 can be demonstrated in vitro using both chemical cross-linking and SPR.FIGURE 3Complex formation of the isolated intermembrane space domains of Tim50 and Tim23 measured by surface plasmon resonance. A, Tim23IMS was immobilized at a density of ∼800 RU in the channel. The chip was rotated at 90°, and six different concentrations of Tim50IMS analyte were injected simultaneously at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for a 200-s association phase, followed by a 600-s dissociation phase.

The TIM23IMS domains of these mutants were prepared as described above for wild type. Upon chemical cross-linking only two mutants (Y70A and L71A) showed impaired interaction with Tim50IMS as compared with wild type (Fig. 4, A and B, and data not shown). Analysis by SPR demonstrated virtually complete lack of interaction of Tim23IMSY70A and Tim23IMSL71A with Tim50IMS (Fig. 4, C and D). The mutant P60A showed a reduction of its KD relative by a factor of three as compared with wild type (Table 2).FIGURE 4Interaction of Tim23IMS mutants with Tim50IMS determined by cross-linking and surface plasmon resonance. A and B, mutants Y70A and L71A, respectively, of Tim23IMS were subjected to chemical cross-linking, as described for Fig. 2.

Open table in a new tab Examination of Tim23 Mutants in Vivo—In view of the striking loss of interaction displayed by the Y70A and L71A mutants, we analyzed them further with regard to their effects in intact yeast cells. We introduced plasmids carrying Tim23Y70A, Tim23L71A, or the double mutation into a yeast strain containing a chromosomal deletion of TIM23, which could be rescued by the wild type copy of Tim23 on the URA plasmid. After shuffling the URA plasmids out on medium containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid, yeast strains harboring only the mutant forms of Tim23 were obtained. Whereas the single mutants displayed no obvious growth defect under the conditions analyzed, the Tim23Y70A,L71A double mutant showed temperature-sensitive growth and was inviable at 37 °C (Fig. 5A). We therefore chose to further investigate only the double mutant. In mitochondria isolated from this strain grown at permissive temperature, the stability of Tim23 was unaffected, and the endogenous levels were observed to be unchanged (data not shown). The interaction between Tim23 and Tim50 in wild type and mutant mitochondria was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation. The complex between Tim23 and Tim50 observed in wild type was not detected in the Tim23 double mutant (Fig. 5B). The same result was obtained irrespective of whether antibodies to Tim23 or to Tim50 were used for immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, the interaction of Tim23 with other subunits of the TIM23 complex such as Tim17, Tim44, and Pam17 was not affected by these mutations. This demonstrates the specific involvement of the respective residues in the interaction of the IMS domain of Tim23 with Tim50.FIGURE 5Phenotypes of mutations in the intermembrane space domain of Tim23. A, 10-fold serial dilutions of yeast cells carrying wild type (WT) Tim23 or Y70A, L71A, or Y70L71AA mutants were spotted onto YPG plates and grown at the indicated temperatures for 2 days. B, mitochondria isolated from wild type or cells carrying the Y70AL71A double mutation in Tim23 were solubilized with digitonin and subjected to immunoprecipitation using affinity purified antibodies to Tim23 and Tim50. Antibodies from preimmune serum were used as a control. Total and immunoprecipitated fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunodecoration with indicated antibodies. C, mitochondria as above were incubated in the presence or absence of PK for the indicated times and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunodecoration with the depicted antibodies. Tom70, Tim50, and Hep1 were used as marker proteins for the outer membrane, intermembrane space, and the matrix, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The first ∼20 residues of Tim23, normally accessible to the externally added protease in intact mitochondria, were found in a protease-protected location in mitochondria lacking Tim50 (22Yamamoto H.

Here we performed systematic investigations on the volumetric nature of the amyloidogenic conformations of β2-microglobulin (β2-m) and its amyloidogenic core peptide, K3, using a high precision densitometer. The transition from the acid-denatured β2-m to the mature amyloid fibrils was accompanied by a positive change in the partial specific volume, which was larger than that observed for the transition from the acid-denatured β2-m to the native structure. The data imply that the mature amyloid fibrils are more voluminous than the native structure because of a sparse packing density of side chains. In contrast, the formation of the mature amyloid-like fibrils of the K3 from the random coil was followed by a considerable decrease in the partial specific volume, suggesting a highly compact core structure. Interestingly, the immature amyloid-like fibrils of β2-m exhibited a volume intermediate between those of the mature fibrils of β2-m and K3, because of the core structure at their center and the relatively noncompact region around the core with much hydration. These volumetric differences would result from the nature of main-chain-dominated fibrillogenesis. We suggest comprehensive models for these three types of fibrils illustrating packing and hydrational states.

We suggest comprehensive models for these three types of fibrils illustrating packing and hydrational states. A polypeptide chain folds spontaneously to the most stable form, the native structure. However, it has been recognized that a misfolding-induced ordered aggregate, known as an amyloid, is an alternative fold that might be in the global minimum of free energy (1Jahn T.R. Radford S.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys.. 2008; 469: 100-117Google Scholar). Intriguingly, various nonamyloidogenic polypeptides can also assemble into fibrillar structures, implying that fibrillation is a generic property of polypeptides (2Dobson C.M. Nature.. 2003; 426: 884-890Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that although the native structure depends on interactions among side chains of amino acid residues, i.e. a side-chain-dominated structure, the amyloidogenic structure does not depend on interactions of side chains, i.e. a main-chain-dominated structure. It is therefore conceivable that a main-chain-dominated fibrillar structure is misfolded without optimal packing of side chains, and a side-chain-dominated native structure has evolved pursuing a unique fold with optimal packing of residues (3Chatani E. Kato M. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol.. 2005; 352: 941-951Google Scholar, 4Chatani E. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol.. 2006; 359: 1086-1096Google Scholar, 5Kardos J. Yamamoto K. Hasegawa K.

This defective packing results in a lot of cavities, thereby rendering multiple fibrillar conformations, the so-called polymorphism (4Chatani E. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol.. 2006; 359: 1086-1096Google Scholar). By contrast, fibrils of amyloidogenic core peptides were suggested to possess tight packing (7Nelson R. Sawaya M.R. Balbirnie M. Madsen A.O. Riekel C.

Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Google Scholar), much remains to elucidate about the conformational and thermodynamic features of fibrous proteins. In this respect, the volumetric technique for fibrillogenesis is a promising alternative, because volume is a key thermodynamic quantity and can sensitively probe changes of molecular hydration (17Chalikian T.V. Volker J. Anafi D. Breslauer K.J. J. Mol. Biol.. 1997; 274: 237-252Google Scholar), intrinsic packing (18Gekko K. Kimoto A. Kamiyama T.

Dobson C.M. Heremans K. J. Mol. Biol.. 2005; 347: 903-909Google Scholar), there is no consensus over the volumetric properties of fibrillation. Our previous study (3Chatani E. Kato M. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol.. 2005; 352: 941-951Google Scholar) showed that mature amyloid fibrils of β2-microglobulin (β2-m) 2The abbreviations used are: β2-m, β2-microglobulin; ASA, accessible surface area; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; AFM, atomic force microscopy; Gdn-HCl, guanidine hydrochloride; HDex, hydrogen deuterium exchange; PMV, partial molar volume; SV, sedimentation velocity; ThT, thioflavin T; HEWL, hen egg white lysozyme; TTR, transthyretin. 2The abbreviations used are: β2-m, β2-microglobulin; ASA, accessible surface area; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; AFM, atomic force microscopy; Gdn-HCl, guanidine hydrochloride; HDex, hydrogen deuterium exchange; PMV, partial molar volume; SV, sedimentation velocity; ThT, thioflavin T; HEWL, hen egg white lysozyme; TTR, transthyretin. (99 residues) are in a voluminous state with loose packing. Similarly, Foguel et al. (21Foguel D. Suarez M.C. Ferrao-Gonzales A.D. Porto T.C. Palmieri L. Einsiedler C.M. Andrade L.R. Lashuel H.A. Lansbury P.T. Kelly J.W. Silva J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 9831-9836Google Scholar) reported that amyloidogenesis of transthyretin (TTR, 127 residues) and α-synuclein (140 residues) correlated with less packed structures (larger volume changes). Akasaka et al. (22Akasaka K. Latif A.R. Nakamura A. Matsuo K. Tachibana H. Gekko K. Biochemistry.. 2007; 46: 10444-10450Google Scholar) also found that a disulfide-deficient variant of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL, 129 residues) formed flexible amyloid-like fibrils with an increase in volume. Conversely, Winter and co-workers (23Smirnovas V. Winter R. Funck T. Dzwolak W. J. Phys. Chem. B.. 2005; 109: 19043-19045Google Scholar, 24Smirnovas V. Winter R. Funck T. Dzwolak W. Chemphyschem.. 2006; 7: 1046-1049Google Scholar) observed that the transition from poly-d-lysine (∼200 residues) and insulin (51 residues) monomers to mature fibrils was in both cases accompanied by reductions in volume (i.e. structural compaction). It is also intriguing that the mature and the early fibrils of a short fragment of TTR-(105–115) (11 residues) take denser and looser packing than the mature fibrils of full-length TTR, respectively (21Foguel D. Suarez M.C. Ferrao-Gonzales A.D. Porto T.C. Palmieri L. Einsiedler C.M. Andrade L.R. Lashuel H.A. Lansbury P.T. Kelly J.W. Silva J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 9831-9836Google Scholar, 25Dirix C. Meersman F. MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.M. Heremans K. J. Mol. Biol.. 2005; 347: 903-909Google Scholar). These disparities of volumetric changes on fibrillation could reflect the intrinsic feature of polymorphism of amyloid(-like) fibrils. Most importantly, to obtain a reliable volume value of a solute of interest, one should certify that solutes are dispersive enough without precipitation (17Chalikian T.V. Volker J. Anafi D. Breslauer K.J. J. Mol. Biol.. 1997; 274: 237-252Google Scholar) and confirm the constituent components with their populations. These prerequisites become more serious in the case of a polymerization reaction such as fibrillation. Fibrillar or amorphous aggregates are apt to precipitate because of high molecular weight, and unreacted monomers are often left. In view of the notions for the polymorphism and core structures of fibrils, the model of the amyloidogenicity of β2-m is excellent because volumetric properties of the various fibrillar structures formed by the identical β2-m and its fragment can be examined systematically. Typically, rigid and long amyloid fibrils referred to as “mature fibrils” are assembled by acid-denatured β2-m (3Chatani E. Kato M. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol.. 2005; 352: 941-951Google Scholar, 4Chatani E. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol.. 2006; 359: 1086-1096Google Scholar, 5Kardos J. Yamamoto K. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol.

Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Google Scholar). At high concentrations (>200 mm) of sodium chloride at acidic pH, β2-m can assemble spontaneously into flexible thin amyloid-like fibrils, often called “immature fibrils” (26Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Google Scholar, 27McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Google Scholar). In addition, K3 peptide, an amyloidogenic core fragment corresponding to Ser-20 to Lys-41 of β2-m, can form amyloid-like fibrils similar to mature fibrils at neutral pH (14Yamaguchi K. Katou H. Hoshino M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 338: 559-571Google Scholar) and thin filamentous fibrils at acidic pH in the absence and presence of 20% (v/v) 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, respectively (28Yamaguchi K. Takahashi S. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol.. 2005; 352: 952-960Google Scholar). Keeping the prerequisites for preparing sample solution for densitometry described above in mind and to gain insight into volumetric properties of amyloidogenesis, we have performed direct measurements of changes in volume accompanying the fibrillation of β2-m and K3, using a high precision densitometry. To our surprise, the extent of the partial volumetric changes upon the formation of the mature fibrils and immature fibrils of β2-m, and the mature fibrils of K3, differed. Here we report the partial volume and states of these three fibrillar conformations in light of the main-chain-dominated fibrillation and the core structure of fibrils with polymorphism. Preparation and Characterization of the Samples—Recombinant human β2-m was expressed and purified using the Escherichia coli expression system as described (15Kihara M. Chatani E. Iwata K. Yamamoto K. Matsuura T. Nakagawa A. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 31061-31069Google Scholar). K3 was obtained by digestion of β2-m with lysyl endopeptidase (Achromobacter protease I) as reported (16Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Google Scholar). For CD and measurements of density, β2-m was dissolved in 6 mm HCl (pH 2.3) and 38 mm NaCl or 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 2.5) in the presence and absence of 5.7 m Gdn-HCl and, in turn, K3 in solution of 6 mm HCl and 38 mm NaCl. Mature β2-m fibrils of 1.2 mg·ml-1 were elongated in a 6 mm HCl solution (pH 2.3) containing 38 mm NaCl in the presence of 5 μg·ml-1 of seeds, ultrasonicated fibrils, at 37 °C for ∼14 h. The short mature fibrils were prepared by ultrasonicating the fresh mature fibrils 100 times on ice using a Microson sonicator (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY) at intensity level 2 and with 20 1-s pulses. The fibrils were confirmed to be fragmented with AFM (data not shown). Immature fibrils of β2-m were spontaneously polymerized as reported (26Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture containing 0.6 mg·ml-1 of recombinant β2-m, 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 2.5), and 200 mm NaCl. The reaction solution was incubated at 37 °C for ∼90 h. Mature fibrils of K3 were seed-dependently polymerized by K3 monomer in the solution containing 6 mm HCl, 7 mm NaCl, and 0.00091% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. Details of the preparation of K3 fibrils are presented in the supplemental material. All the polymerization reactions in this study were traced by fluorometric analysis using ThT and monitored at 485 nm with excitation at 445 nm with a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer, F4500, at 25 °C as reported (16Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Google Scholar, 26Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectra of all samples were measured at 25 °C with a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter, using a cell with a light-path of 1 mm. AFM images were obtained using a Nano Scope IIIa (Digital Instruments/Veeco) at 25 °C. Sedimentation Velocity (SV) with Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC)—SV measurements were performed on the mature and immature fibrils of β2-m and the mature fibrils of K3 at 5 °C using a Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge (Fullerton, CA) equipped with an An-60 rotor and two- or six-channel charcoal-filled Epon cells. After pre-centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min, the rotor speed was increased to 17,400–31,000 × g. The sedimentation curves were recorded using absorbance data at 280 nm at intervals of 10–20 min. All conditions for SV were identical to those for polymerization reactions except temperature. Each measurement was conducted with a radial increment of 0.003 cm in a continuous scanning mode. High Precision Density Measurements—All measurements of density were made using a vibrating tube density meter (DMA5000, Anton Paar, Austria) with a precision of 1 × 10-6 g·ml-1, and the polypeptide concentration was between 0.25 and 4 mg·ml-1. To prevent condensation in measuring density at 5 °C, a U-shaped densitometric cell was thoroughly dried with the use of a dry air pump, and ambient relative air humidity and temperature were kept under 30% and 25 °C, respectively. The adjustments with water and air were performed following every single set of measurements, and almost no deviation of water density before and after a series of density measurements was confirmed. Characterization of Various Conformational States—The far-UV CD spectrum of native β2-m at pH 7.0 (Fig. 1A) is consistent with that of our earlier study that exhibited a 7-stranded β-sheet as shown by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 2A) (15Kihara M. Chatani E. Iwata K. Yamamoto K. Matsuura T. Nakagawa A. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 31061-31069Google Scholar, 26Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Google Scholar). In contrast, β2-m is largely unfolded at pH 2.3 as indicated by far-UV CD (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 2Distinct conformational states of β2-m.

The scale bars represent 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We obtained a clear solution of the mature fibrils of β2-m by performing seed-dependent elongation in 6 mm HCl (pH 2.3) and 38 mm NaCl. The intensity of the ThT fluorescence increased with the incubation period without a lag time (Fig. 1B). The far-UV CD spectra of these fibrils possessed a minimum at 220 nm and were compatible with those of mature fibrils studied previously (Fig. 1A) (16Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 1310-1315Google Scholar, 26Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Google Scholar). In AFM images, mature fibrils showed a morphology similar to that of the typical amyloid fibrils formed at acidic pH and 100 mm NaCl, i.e. several micrometers in length with a diameter of ∼5 nm (Fig. 2B) (3Chatani E. Kato M. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol.. 2005; 352: 941-951Google Scholar). We ensured the satisfactory dispersion of fibrils for measurements of density and confirmed the presence of residual monomers using SV at 17,400 × g and 5 °C for several hours with AUC equipped with a UV-visible absorption optical system. We obtained a series of sedimentation curves by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm, suggesting the absence of precipitates, i.e. uniformly dispersed solutes (Fig. 3A). If much larger molecules not suitable for densitometric measurements are present, one cannot obtain a series of well defined sedimentation curves. For instance, amyloid β-(1–40) fibrils formed at pH 7.2 rapidly sedimented during pre-centrifugation at 700 × g within 5 min, as shown in supplemental Fig. S1A. On the basis of SV, a distribution of sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) values for mature β2-m fibrils was obtained (supplemental Fig. S1B). The s20,w, which reflects a molecular weight, showed a broad distribution from 100 S to 350 S. The variance in s20,w values may come from the difference in length of fibrils. The base lines of UV spectra of the sedimentation curves were slightly above zero, indicating that not all monomers transformed into fibrils. The residual monomers accounted for up to about 10% of the total intensity of absorbance. To examine the effects on volume of the increase in accessible surface area (ASA) of the terminal parts of the fibrils, we further investigated the partial volume of short mature fibrils of β2-m prepared by ultrasonicating long mature fibrils. SV measurements for the short mature fibrils were conducted at 17,400 × g and 5 °C for several hours. We obtained a sedimentation pattern indicating the fibrils to be well dispersed (Fig. 3B). The s20,w values of short fibrils exhibited a narrow distribution from 50 S to 90 S (supplemental Fig. S1B). The values were smaller than those of long fibrils, implying that the fibrils were shortened by sonication. About 10% of residual monomers remained unreacted based on the absorbance at 280 nm (Fig. 3B). The immature fibrils of β2-m were spontaneously polymerized in solution containing 200 mm NaCl at pH 2.5 and 37 °C. The formation of fibrils was monitored by the changes in intensity of ThT, and immature fibrils were elongated without a lag time as in our previous study (Fig. 1B) (26Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Google Scholar). The far-UV CD spectrum was consistent with that of the earlier study (Fig. 1A) (26Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Google Scholar). The AFM image revealed fibrils that were curved and short with a small diameter (∼2 nm) (Fig. 2C). The immature fibrils prepared here were shorter than the previously reported immature fibrils (26Hong D.P. Gozu M. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 21554-21560Google Scholar) because of the low concentration of salt (200 mm NaCl) compared with the previous study (400 mm NaCl) (1Jahn T.R. Radford S.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys.. 2008; 469: 100-117Google Scholar). However, this difference could not affect volumetric properties as in the case of long and short mature fibrils of β2-m (see under “Discussion”). Based on the results of the SV experiments with AUC at 31,000 × g and 5 °C for several hours, immature fibrils were in a sufficiently dispersed state (Fig. 3C). The s20,w values showed a narrow distribution from 10 S to 30 S (supplemental Fig. S1B). The smaller s20,w values than those of mature fibrils would be due to the short length and single-stranded property (Fig. 2C). The base lines of UV spectra were nearly zero, indicating that almost all monomers were transformed into fibrils (Fig. 3C). The far-UV CD spectrum of K3 peptides at 6 mm HCl (pH 2.3) and 38 mm NaCl showed a substantially unfolded structure (Fig. 1A). The mature fibrils were seed-dependently polymerized at 6 mm HCl (pH 2.3) and 7 mm NaCl. The fibril formation monitored by ThT intensity exhibited a similar profile to that of immature fibrils but was slightly higher (Fig. 1B). The CD spectrum of K3 fibrils was similar with that of mature β2-m fibrils (Fig. 1A). The AFM image of K3 fibrils revealed long thin fibrillar structures with a diameter of ∼3 nm (Fig. 2D). SV experiments were also undertaken at 17,400 × g and 5 °C for several hours. We found that mature K3 fibrils were dispersive enough, and about 10% K3 monomers were left as judged from absorbance baselines (Fig. 3D). The distribution of s20,w values of K3 fibrils had a broad range from 10 S to 120 S (supplemental Fig. S1B). Considering the long length of K3 fibrils (Fig. 2D), the small s20,w values compared with those of β2-m fibrils could result from the low molecular weight of K3 monomers and the single- or double-stranded property. Density and Volumetric Measurements—Density values of individual samples measured were transformed into the apparent specific volume (νapp) using Equation 1. To obtain the partial specific volume at infinite dilution, ν°, a series of νapp values were plotted against concentration and then linearly extrapolated to the zero concentration according to Equation 2 (Fig. 4), vapp=1/c−(ρ−c)/ρ0c(Eq. 1) vo=lim vappc→0(Eq. 2) where ρ and ρ0 are the densities of the solution and solvent, respectively; and c is the specific concentration of the protein in grams/ml of solution. The measured densities and calculated νapp of all the samples are shown in Fig. 4, and the mean ν° values of the three series of density measurements for all the samples are presented Table 1.TABLE 1Summary of partial specific volume (ν°) for polypeptides of various conformationsPolypeptideν°Conditionsml·g–1Native HEWL0.711 ± 0.00225°C, water from this studyNative HEWL0.712 ± 0.00125°C, water from Gekko and Noguchi (29Gekko K.

We first obtained a ν° of HEWL comparable with that of an earlier study under the same conditions (29Gekko K. Noguch H. J. Phys. Chem.. 1979; 83: 2706-2714Google Scholar). The ν° of FNR was larger than that of ferredoxin at pH 6.0 and 20 °C. Native β2-m at pH 7.0 and 20 °C had a small ν° compared with ferredoxin and FNR. The ν° of native β2-m dropped as the temperature was lowered. For the densitometry of all fibrils prepared, we conducted measurements at low temperature, 5 °C, to avoid destabilization and lateral aggregation of fibrils. Hence, to compare differences in the volume of diverse conformational states at the same temperature, the densities of native and denatured β2-m as well as K3 peptide were also measured at 5 °C. The ν° values obtained were in the following order: mature fibrils > native monomer > acid-denatured monomer ≈ K3 monomer > immature fibrils >> mature fibrils of K3. The formation of the main-chain-dominated structure of fibrils from monomers showed various changes in volume. Mature fibrils of β2-m showed the largest ν° of the polypeptides explored here. The ν° values of immature and mature K3 fibrils were lower than a side-chain-dominated native β2-m. The ν° value of mature K3 fibrils was the lowest of the three fibrous conformations. As largely extended β2-m folded to its a native structure, the Δν° increased as much as 0.016 ± 0.009 ml·g-1. This Δν° corresponds to the change in partial molar volume (PMV) of 190 ± 106 ml·mol-1. The transition from the unfolded β2-m to mature fibrils was accompanied by an augmentation of volume, Δν° = 0.046 ± 0.008 ml·g-1 and Δ"
https://openalex.org/W2139519214,"Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is a key enzyme in the mobilization of fatty acids from stored triacylglycerols. Its activity is regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation. In rat HSL Ser563, Ser659 and Ser660 have been shown to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) in vitro as well as in vivo.In this study we employed site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro phosphorylation and mass spectrometry to show that in vitro phosphorylation of human HSL by PKA occurs primarily on Ser649 and Ser650 (Ser659 and Ser660 in rat HSL). The wild type enzyme and four mutants were expressed in C-terminally His-tagged form in Sf9 insect cells and purified to homogeneity. HSL variants in which Ser552 and/or Ser554 were mutated to Ala or Glu retained both lipolytic and non-lipolytic activity and were phosphorylated by PKA and activated to a similar extent as the wild type enzyme. (32)P-labeling studies revealed that the bulk of the phosphorylation was on the Ser649/Ser650 site, with only a minor phosphorylation of Ser552 and Ser554. MS/MS analysis demonstrated that the peptide containing Ser649 and Ser650 was primarily phosphorylated on Ser650. The mutant lacking all four serines had severely reduced lipolytic activity, but a lesser reduction in non-lipolytic activity, had S(0.5) values for p-nitrophenol butyrate and triolein comparable to those of wild type HSL and was not phosphorylated by PKA. PKA phosphorylation of the wild type enzyme resulted in an increase in both the maximum turnover and S(0,5) using the TO substrate.Our results demonstrate that PKA activates human HSL against lipid substrates in vitro primarily through phosphorylation of Ser649 and Ser650. In addition the results suggest that Ser649 and Ser650 are located in the vicinity of a lipid binding region and that PKA phosphorylation controls the accessibility of this region."

(2000) Nature 407, 94-98) that the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) form constitutive heterodimers. Furthermore they demonstrate that AT1R signaling significantly increases in the presence of the B2R. These findings suggest that heterodimerization and potentiation of AT1R signaling is a universal phenomenon that occurs as a natural consequence of simultaneous expression of the two receptors. Hence this potential interaction is of great pharmacological and biological interest that adds an additional layer of complexity to the understanding of the cross-talk between the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems. Given the remarkable significance of this finding, scientists from four independent research groups have set out to reproduce and further examine the potential AT1R/B2R interaction. We have investigated functional potentiation by the B2R of AT1R signaling in three different cell lines using multiple assays including phosphoinositide hydrolysis, ERK activation, β-arrestin recruitment, and receptor selection and amplification technology, and we have examined dimerization using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and regulated secretion/aggregation technology. However, although both the AT1Rs and B2Rs were functional in our systems and the systems were fine tuned to detect small changes in receptor function, we failed to detect any functional modulation by or physical interaction between the two receptor proteins. In contrast to the previous observations, our data collectively suggest that AT1R/B2R heterodimerization does not occur as a natural consequence of their simultaneous expression in the same cell nor does the B2R influence the AT1R signaling.

The AT1R is a key regulator of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis, and its importance in renal and cardiovascular pathophysiology is underscored by the widespread use of receptor blockers and inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme in clinical practice (1Zaman M.A. Oparil S.

There is mounting evidence that the AT1R may form both homo- and heterodimers and that dimerization could be important for the receptor function (3Hansen J.L. Theilade J. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. J.

For example, it has been shown that the AT1R decreases Gq coupling when the receptor interacts with either the MAS or the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors (6AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M.

It has also been shown that the AT1R can form complexes with the β2-adrenergic receptors and that it is possible to achieve dual receptor inhibition of AT1R and β2-adrenergic receptor signaling using only a single receptor antagonist (9Barki-Harrington L. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1611-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The AT1R also co-immunoprecipitates with the Dopamine D1 and D3 receptor in tissue specimen obtained from Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats (13Zeng C. Luo Y. Asico L.D. Hopfer U. Eisner G.M. Felder R.A. Jose P.A. Hypertension. 2003; 42: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Zeng C. Asico L.D. Wang X. Hopfer U. Eisner G.M. Felder R.A. Jose P.A. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally AbdAlla et al. (5AbdAlla S. Abdel-Baset A. Lother H. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 26: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7AbdAlla S. Lother H. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) have shown in a number of studies that the AT1R forms heterodimers with the B2R. From these studies, they derive three important pharmacological conclusions. First, the AT1R and the B2R form heterodimers in all the cellular systems examined including HEK293 cells (16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), primary cells such as vascular smooth muscle cells (16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), neurons (5AbdAlla S. Abdel-Baset A. Lother H. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 26: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and platelets (7AbdAlla S. Lother H. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the system is “universal” and that AT1R/B2R heterodimerization occurs as a natural consequence of simultaneous AT1R and B2R expression within the same cell (5AbdAlla S. Abdel-Baset A. Lother H. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 26: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7AbdAlla S. Lother H. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Second, when compared with the individually expressed receptors, the AT1R/B2R heterodimer signals with higher potency and efficacy upon Ang II stimulation, whereas bradykinin signaling remains largely unaffected (16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Third, the B2R must be competent to engage its G protein signaling pathway to produce the functional AT1R potentiation (16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). From a medical perspective, the AT1R/B2R interaction would be of outstanding value because the authors show that it can be linked to experimental hypertension (5AbdAlla S. Abdel-Baset A. Lother H. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 26: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), vascular smooth muscle cell contraction (16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and preeclampsia (7AbdAlla S. Lother H. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The disease relevance of the dimer implies that development of AT1R/B2R heterodimer-specific antagonists could be beneficial for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The interaction is also of great biological interest because it could add an additional layer of complexity to the understanding of the cross-talk between the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems (17Shen B. Harrison-Bernard L.M. Fuller A.J. Vanderpool V. Saifudeen Z. El-Dahr S.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Tan Y. Hutchison F.N. Jaffa A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H926Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both systems are intricately connected. (i) The AT1R mediates vasoconstriction, whereas the B2R is a vasodepressor (17Shen B. Harrison-Bernard L.M. Fuller A.J. Vanderpool V. Saifudeen Z. El-Dahr S.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Tan Y. Hutchison F.N. Jaffa A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H926Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). (ii) Angiotensin-converting enzyme is responsible for both production of circulating Ang II and at the same time degradation of bradykinin (19Yang H.Y. Erdos E.G. Levin Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 214: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). (iii) AT1R activation leads to up-regulation of the B2R (17Shen B. Harrison-Bernard L.M. Fuller A.J. Vanderpool V. Saifudeen Z. El-Dahr S.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Tan Y. Hutchison F.N. Jaffa A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H926Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that many biological effects of AT1R blockers such as losartan are in fact mediated by the release of bradykinin and, accordingly, can be blocked by the B2R inhibitor HOE130 (20Hu K. Gaudron P. Anders H.J. Weidemann F. Turschner O. Nahrendorf M. Ertl G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 39: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Zhu P. Zaugg C.E. Hornstein P.S. Allegrini P.R.

Circulation. 2000; 102: III346-III351PubMed Google Scholar). Finally heterodimerization between the AT2 receptor and B2R has also been proposed to enhance NO release (23Abadir P.M. Periasamy A. Carey R.M. Siragy H.M. Hypertension. 2006; 48: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and it has been implicated in left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction in mice (24Isbell D.C. Voros S. Yang Z. DiMaria J.M. Berr S.S. French B.A. Epstein F.H. Bishop S.P. Wang H. Roy R.J. Kemp B.A. Matsubara H. Carey R.M. Kramer C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: H3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The concept of 7TM receptor heterodimerization is of emerging importance, and it will be crucial to address general questions with respect to experimental pitfalls, specificity, generality, and biological significance of a given heterodimeric interaction. Scientists from four independent groups set out to study the putative AT1R/B2R heterodimerization in detail. Surprisingly although both the AT1Rs and the B2Rs were functional in our studies, we were not able to establish any functional potentiation or physical interaction between the two receptors. Despite careful experimental fine tuning, our data do not support the concept of an AT1R/B2R heterodimer occurring as a natural consequence of simultaneous AT1R and B2R expression in the same cell. The rAT1aR and the hAT1R have been described previously (3Hansen J.L. Theilade J. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24108-24115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Hansen J.L. Haunso S. Brann M.R. Sheikh S.P. Weiner D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using PCR-based methods, the rB2R was cloned from rat heart cDNA, and the hB2R was cloned from human smooth muscle cDNA. Both receptors were fully sequence-verified and subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and pSI (Promega) expression vectors, respectively. The wild type rat B2R sequence is identical to that of GenBank™ accession number M59967 (26McEachern A.E. Shelton E.R. Bhakta S. Obernolte R. Bach C. Zuppan P. Fujisaki J. Aldrich R.W. Jarnagin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7724-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and the human B2R is identical to that described in Hess et al. (27Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S. Strader C.D. Ransom R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The enhanced GFP-tagged bovine β-arrestin 2 and AT1R-Rluc were reported previously (3Hansen J.L. Theilade J. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24108-24115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Hansen J.L. Haunso S. Brann M.R. Sheikh S.P. Weiner D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To perform this assay, we seeded 2.5 × 106 COS-7 cells in a p10 dish and transfected the cells with the amounts of receptor plasmid described under “Results” using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 1 day, the cells were seeded into 48-well plates coated with 0.25% poly-l-lysine (100,000 cells/well) and incubated in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with myo-[2-3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences). Twenty hours after transfection, the cells were assayed as described previously (3Hansen J.L. Theilade J. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24108-24115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Jensen A.A. Hansen J.L. Sheikh S.P. Brauner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5076-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This assay was performed as described previously (3Hansen J.L. Theilade J. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. J. Biol.

After 24 h, the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The day after transfection they were seeded onto 6-well plates. Next 45 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 3 h, incubated with agonist for 12 min at 37 °C, and then lysed. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (30Aplin M. Christensen G.L. Schneider M. Heydorn A. Gammeltoft S. Kjolbye A.L. Sheikh S.P. Hansen J.L. Basic Clin. Pharmacol.

To assess the relative efficacies of agonists, a densitometric gel quantification of the phosphorylated ERK (P-ERK) and total ERK band intensities was performed, and the ratios of P-ERK to total ERK were normalized with reference to the receptor maximum Ang II response (100%). This assay was performed as described previously (3Hansen J.L. Theilade J. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. J. Biol.

After 24 h, the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. We used 20 μg of GFP2-β-arrestin 2 and 1 μg of rAT1R-Rluc or B2R-Luc DNA with either 3 μg of empty vector, B2R, or AT1R as described in the text. The cells were isolated and submitted to either basal or agonist treatment for 20 min at room temperature before measuring the BRET2 ratios as described in the text and previously (3Hansen J.L. Theilade J. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24108-24115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). RSAT was performed as described previously (25Hansen J.L.

Pharmacol. 2008; 590: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly NIH3T3 cells at 70-80% confluence were transfected with cDNA as follows (0-25 ng of receptor as described in the figures and 20 ng of β-galactosidase reporter/well of a 96-well plate) using the PolyFect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. One day after transfection, ligands were added in DMEM supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 2% Cyto-SF3. After 6 days, the medium was removed by aspiration, cells were lysed, O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the resulting absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically. All concentration-response curves were performed in duplicate. BRET2 Assay—Except for minor differences, the BRET2 assay was performed as described previously (3Hansen J.L. Theilade J. Haunsø S.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 5076-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly 0.5 million COS-7 cells/well were seeded into a 6-well plate and grown in 10% fetal calf serum, DMEM overnight. After 24 h the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (varying amounts of DNA were used to assure equal expression levels between the different combinations). After 2 days, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the indicator dye before detachment in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then split into two portions. The first portion was used to examine the GFP2 levels by fluorescent measurements as described previously (3Hansen J.L. Theilade J. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. J. Biol.

Theilade J. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24108-24115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Jensen A.A. Hansen J.L. Sheikh S.P. Brauner-Osborne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5076-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The second portion of the cells was submitted to DeepBlueC excitation, and the luminescence at the dual bands (515/30 and 410/80 nm) was measured on a Fusion reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The BRET2 ratio was determined according to the principle described in (32Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). The BRET2 ratio equals [(emission 515/30)-(emission 410/80) × Cf)]/(emission 410/80) where Cf denotes the cross-Rluc luminescence cross-talk ratio into the 515/30 filter defined as (emission 515/30)/(emission 410/80) when Rluc expressed alone is excited.

Rothman J.E. Clackson T. Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and is available from ARIAD Pharmaceuticals. The assay was performed as described previously (3Hansen J.L. Theilade J. Haunsø S. Sheikh S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24108-24115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly 2.5 × 106 COS-7 cells were seeded in a p10 dish and transfected with 10 μg of Fm4-AT1R (either wild type or mutant) cDNA alone or together with 2 μg of wild type B2R DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, the cells were split into 48-well plates coated with 0.25% poly-l-lysine (100,000 cells/well) and stimulated with or without AP21998 at 2 μm for 2 h prior to performing the PI hydrolysis assays as described above. The B2R Does Not Enhance AT1R-mediated G Protein Activation in Various Cellular Models—AbdAlla et al. (5AbdAlla S. Abdel-Baset A. Lother H. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 26: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7AbdAlla S. Lother H. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) have shown that simultaneous expression of functional B2Rs dramatically increases the ability of AT1Rs to activate Gαq signaling. These studies were performed very carefully in a variety of systems including HEK293 cells (16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), primary cells such as vascular smooth muscle cells (16AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), neurons (5AbdAlla S. Abdel-Baset A. Lother H. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 26: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and platelets (7AbdAlla S. Lother H. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Given the natural interest in this interaction and its significant (patho)physiological relevance, we set out to examine this interaction in more detail. To be able to detect enhanced signaling, it is pivotal that the assay is within a dynamic range that allows for detection of further increases in signaling. We therefore transfected increasing amounts of AT1R cDNA into COS-7 cells and measured the Ang II-induced PI hydrolysis (Fig. 1A). We observed that an increasing amount of DNA would result in increased signaling up to the level of 10 μg of DNA/10-cm culture dish. Next we analyzed the effect of B2R expression on AT1R signaling. To do so, we compared the Ang II-induced signaling in cells transfected with either 2 μg of AT1R alone or with 0.5, 2, or 5 μg of B2R as indicated in Fig. 1B. Surprisingly we did not observe any changes in the AT1R efficacy or potency even though our system is indeed able to pick up changes as shown in Fig. 1A. AT1R expression did not change by co-transfection of the B2R and was consistently in the range of 20-22 fmol of receptor/100,000 cells as determined by radioligand binding as described previously (25Hansen J.L. Haunso S. Brann M.R. Sheikh S.P. Weiner D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The bradykinin receptor expression and function increased as a result of increasing amounts of B2R cDNA transfection. The expression levels of the B2R per 100,000 cells were 7 ± 3 fmol (for 0.5 μg of B2R), 23 ± 4 fmol (for 2 μg of B2R), and 50 ± 6 fmol (for 5 μg of B2R). Functional activity of the B2R was verified in the PI hydrolysis assay (Fig. 1C). In addition, we have tried several combinations of cDNAs in COS-7 cells, and we also have performed analysis in HEK-293 cells, but we have not observed any gain of function of the AT1R as a result of B2R co-transfection (data not shown). The B2R Does Not Enhance AT1R-mediated β-Arrestin 2 Recruitment or ERK Activation in Different Cellular Models—To test whether potentiation by the B2R of AT1R signaling could be detected with other functional assays, Ang II-mediated activation of the ERK cascade and β-arrestin 2 recruitment has been investigated. To analyze the Ang II-induced ERK activation, we first confirmed that the system was dynamic as described for the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate assay (Fig. 2A) and then examined the effects on Ang II-mediated AT1R stimulation as a consequence of B2R co-transfection, but we did not see any changes in this assay either (Fig. 2B). To analyze the β-arrestin 2 recruitment, COS-7 cells were transfected with AT1R-Rluc and β-arrestin 2-GFP2 either alone or in combination with the B2R, and the Ang II-induced BRET2 signal was measured. As depicted in Fig. 2C, we failed to detect any changes in the AT1R-mediated β-arrestin 2 recruitment. Failure to detect enhancement by B2R of AT1R-mediated β-arrestin 2 recruitment is not due to lack of activity of the B2R in this functional assay because the B2R-Rluc is capable of inducing a strong β-arrestin 2 translocation response (Fig. 2D). We have shown previously that it is possible to “transactivate” β-arrestin 2 recruitment to an AT1R mutant (K199A) that does not bind Ang II by co-expression of the AT1R-K199A-Rluc, β-arrestin 2-GFP2, and an untagged version of the wild type AT1R (3Hansen J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2096669865,"The relationship between contextual information and object perception has received considerable attention in neuroimaging studies. In the work reported here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the relationship between aesthetic judgment and images of objects in their normal contextual setting versus images of objects in abnormal contextual settings and the underlying brain activity. When object-context relationships are violated changes in visual perception and aesthetic judgment emerges that exposes the contribution of vision to interpretations shaped by previous experience. We found that effects of context on aesthetic judgment modulates different memory sub-systems, while aesthetic judgment regardless of context recruit medial and lateral aspects of the orbitofrontal cortex, consistent with previous findings. Visual cortical areas traditionally associated with the processing of visual features are recruited in normal contexts, irrespective of aesthetic ratings, while prefrontal areas are significantly more engaged when objects are viewed in unaccustomed settings."
https://openalex.org/W1994560999,"A great deal of sub-cellular organelle positioning, and essentially all minus-ended organelle transport, depends on cytoplasmic dynein, but how dynein's function is regulated is not well understood. BicD is established to play a critical role in mediating dynein function-loss of BicD results in improperly localized nuclei, mRNA particles, and a dispersed Golgi apparatus-however exactly what BicD's role is remains unknown. Nonetheless, it is widely believed that BicD may act to tether dynein to cargos. Here we use a combination of biophysical and biochemical studies to investigate BicD's role in lipid droplet transport during Drosophila embryogenesis.Functional loss of BicD impairs the embryo's ability to control the net direction of droplet transport; the developmentally controlled reversal in transport is eliminated. We find that minimal BicD expression (near-BicD(null)) decreases the average run length of both plus and minus end directed microtubule (MT) based transport. A point mutation affecting the BicD N-terminus has very similar effects on transport during cellularization (phase II), but in phase III (gastrulation) motion actually appears better than in the wild-type.In contrast to a simple static tethering model of BicD function, or a role only in initial dynein recruitment to the cargo, our data uncovers a new dynamic role for BicD in actively regulating transport. Lipid droplets move bi-directionally, and our investigations demonstrate that BicD plays a critical-and temporally changing-role in balancing the relative contributions of plus-end and minus-end motors to control the net direction of transport. Our results suggest that while BicD might contribute to recruitment of dynein to the cargo it is not absolutely required for such dynein localization, and it clearly contributes to regulation, helping activation/inactivation of the motors."
https://openalex.org/W2125722327,"The regulation of gene expression through alternative pre-mRNA splicing is common in metazoans and is often controlled by intracellular signaling pathways that are important in cell physiology. We have shown that the alternative splicing of a number of genes is controlled by membrane depolarization and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) through CaMKIV-responsive RNA elements (CaRRE1 and CaRRE2); however, the trans-acting factors remain unknown. Here we show that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) L is a CaRRE1 binding factor in nuclear extracts. An hnRNP L high affinity CA (cytidine-adenosine) repeat element is sufficient to mediate CaMKIV and hnRNP L repression of splicing in a location (3′-splice site proximity)-dependent way. Depletion of hnRNP L by RNA interference followed by rescue with coexpressed exogenous hnRNP L demonstrates that hnRNP L mediates the CaMKIV-regulated splicing through CA repeats in heterologous contexts. Depletion of hnRNP L also led to increased inclusion of the stress axis-regulated exon and a CA repeat-harboring exon under depolarization or with activated CaMKIV. Moreover, hnRNP L binding to CaRRE1 was increased by CaMKIV and, conversely, was reduced by pretreatments with protein phosphatases. Therefore, hnRNP L is an essential component of CaMKIV-regulated alternative splicing through CA repeats, with its phosphorylation likely playing a critical role.

Alternative splicing in mammalian systems is often controlled by multiple cis-acting regulatory elements in introns and exons (1Black D.L. Annu. Rev.

The shRNA expression cassette, driven by the human H1 promoter, was then cut off by XbaI and cloned into FG12 (42Qin X.F. An D.S. Chen I.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% of newborn calf serum and rat GH3 pituitary cells in F10 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) with 10% of horse serum plus 2.5% of fetal bovine serum. Transfections of overnight HEK293T cultures were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's procedure. For the HEK293T cells in 24-well plates, 0.1 μg of splicing reporter minigene plasmid and 0.3 μg of another plasmid including CaMKIV-dCT (IV), CaMKIV-dCTK75E (IVm), or hnRNP L-FLAG were used. RNA Interference—Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were produced by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection of HEK293T cells as described previously (43An D.S. Kung S.K. Bonifacino A. Wersto R.P. Metzger M.E. Agricola B.A. Mao S.H. Chen I.S. Donahue R.E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 × 107 HEK293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of pHCMVG, 12.5 μg of pCMVΔR8.2DVPR, and 12.5 μg of the lentiviral plasmids. Culture supernatant was collected on days 2 and 3 post-transfection, pooled, and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. Viral supernatant was further concentrated 100 times by ultracentrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 90 min. Titers of the concentrated virus were determined by enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in transduced HEK293T cells. For transduction, HEK293T cells were plated at a density of 6 × 104 cells per well in a 24-well plate (Falcon) on day 1. On day 2, 25 μl of lentivirus stock (titer ∼1 × 108 units) was mixed with 225 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) then with 2.0 μl of Polybrene (1 μg/μl), gently vortexed, allowed to sit at room temperature for 5 min, incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then pipetted onto the cells. The cells were then incubated with the virus supernatant at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2.5–3.0 h before fresh media were supplied. On day 3 the cells were infected again as on day 2 and transferred into a 6-well plate.

On day 6, the cells were harvested for Western blots (with anti-hnRNP L 4D11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay. For transduction of GH3 cells, similar procedures were followed. RT-PCR—HEK293T cells were harvested 18–22 h after transfection. Cytoplasmic RNA of HEK293T or total RNA of GH3 cells was extracted using GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). RT-PCR was performed as previously described (16Xie J. Black D.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), except that about 400 ng of HEK293T cytoplasmic RNA or GH3 total RNA was used for 10 μl of reverse transcription reaction. PCR reaction of splicing reporters was performed with forward primer DUP8a (5′-CTCAAACAGACACCATGCATGG-3′) and reverse primer DUP1 (5′-GCAGCTCACTCAGTGTGGCA-3′) for 25 cycles. Products were resolved in 2.5% agarose gels with ethidium bromide, visualized, and documented with a digital camera under UV. For hot PCR of endogenous genes of GH3 cells with a 32P-labeled primer, 1 μl of the reverse transcription product was used for 25 cycles. The PCR products were resolved in 5% polyacrylamide, 7.5 m urea gels, which were dried, exposed, and scanned by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad). The percentage of the middle exon-included product is expressed as the percent band intensities relative to the total of exon-included and -excluded products. The band intensities of the agarose gels were not calibrated for product lengths. Nuclear Extract Preparation—HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared on a 5-liter scale (44Black D.L. Chan R.C. Min H. Wang J. Bell L. RNA:Protein Interactions, A practical approach. 1998; (Smith, C., ed), pp. , Oxford University Press, New York: 109-136Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of HEK293T or GH3 cells were made in a smaller scale (45Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the small scale preparation, 3-day cultures in 2–3 dishes of 150 mm in diameter were phosphate-buffered saline-washed three times, resuspended in 5× cell pellet volume of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.4% IGEPAL, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1/1000 protease inhibitor mixture), and left on ice for 10 min. Then the nuclei were pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 1 min, resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1/1000 protease inhibitor mixture) with shaking for 2 h and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was saved as nuclear extracts and diluted 2–3 times before use in DG buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 80 mM potassium glutamate, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PSMF, 1.0 mM DTT) (44Black D.L. Chan R.C. Min H. Wang J. Bell L. RNA:Protein Interactions, A practical approach. 1998; (Smith, C., ed), pp. , Oxford University Press, New York: 109-136Google Scholar). For HEK293T nuclear extracts expressing kinases or together with hnRNP L-FLAG, 5.0 μg of CaMKIVm or CaMKIV or 1.5μg of hnRNP L-FLAG plus 3.0μg of CaMKIV plasmids were transfected into a well of cells grown in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000. UV Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—DNA templates of RNA transcripts were made from splicing reporter plasmids by PCR with T7 promoter-tagged primers. RNA probes were made with T7 RNA polymerase in in vitro transcription (46Ma S. Liu G. Sun Y. Xie J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

UV cross-linking was performed similarly as described (47Chan R.C. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa (∼60 μg), HEK, or GH3 (∼40 μg) nuclear extract was incubated with 3 × 105 cpm of [α-32P]CTP-labeled RNA transcripts in cross-linking buffer (12 mm Hepes-KOH, pH7.9, 12% glycerol, 48 mm potassium glutamate, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.12 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm ATP, 2.2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 0.2 μg/μl yeast tRNA) in 13-μl reaction at 30 °C for 20 min, irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 25 min on ice, and digested with 8 units of RNase T1 plus 4.0 μg of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 10 μl of settled resin of immobilized protein G (Pierce) in 200 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) were incubated with 1.0 μg of anti-hnRNP L (4D11, Santa Cruz), anti-hnRNP LL (Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA), polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) (BB7) (48Chou M.Y. Underwood J.G. Nikolic J. Luu M.H. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), or control antibodies (U2AF65, Sigma-Aldrich, or hnRNP F/H, Santa Cruz) at 4 °C for 4 h with rotation, and washed 5 times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer. Then 10 μl of the beads in 200 μl of RIPA buffer was incubated with 3–8 volumes of UV cross-linking reactions with rotation at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed 5 times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer (containing 150 mm NaCl). The resulting proteins were denatured in SDS loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved in 4–20% or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were dried, exposed, and scanned by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad). Pretreatment of nuclear extracts (about 40 μg) with phosphatases were carried out in λ-protein phosphatase (λ-PPase) buffer lacking the detergent Brij 35 (λ-PPase 1× reaction buffer, New England Biolabs) or calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) buffer (1× dephosphorylation buffer, Invitrogen) with 600 units of λ-PPase or 10 units of CIAP at 30 °C for 30 min or 37 °C for 20 min, respectively. Under this condition, we found that the phosphatases efficiently reduced the 32P-labeled nuclear extract proteins without disrupting subsequent UV cross-linking. In vivo labeling of proteins with [32P]orthophosphoric acid was carried out as described previously (40Xie J. Lee J.A. Kress T.L. Mowry K.L. Black D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8776-8781Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). hnRNP L Is a CaRRE1 Binding Factor—To identify the protein factor(s) binding to the CaRRE1 element of the STREX exon, we carried out a UV cross-linking assay with the upstream 3′-splice site of the middle exon of the splicing reporter DUP175ST (Fig. 1), which harbors the CaRRE1 (16Xie J. Black D.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In HeLa nuclear extracts the wild type RNA transcript was cross-linked mainly to three protein bands of about 55, 65, and 110 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A, right, lane 1). Mutation of the CaRRE1 element mainly reduced the 65- and 110-kDa bands (lane 2). Similarly cross-linked bands were observed in HEK293T nuclear extracts (lanes 3 and 4). Immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked proteins in the HEK293T nuclear extracts with antibodies against hnRNP L (lane 5), hnRNP LL (lane 6), or PTB (lane 7) indicates that the 65-kDa band contains hnRNP L, and the 55-kDa band contains PTB. hnRNP LL is not observed in the precipitates even with twice the nuclear extract input (lane 6). To examine the CaRRE1-binding proteins in depolarized cells, we carried out a similar UV cross-linking assay with nuclear extracts prepared from non-treated or KCl (50 mm)-depolarized GH3 cells (Fig. 1B). The pattern of the cross-linked major bands was similar to that in HeLa and HEK293T nuclear extracts. Interestingly, the ratio of the 65- and 55-kDa bands appears increased by about 10% upon depolarization (compare lanes 1 and 2 and the graph on the right). The cross-linked 65-kDa products was immunoprecipitated by anti-hnRNP L as well (lanes 3 and 4) but not by anti-hnRNP F/H (lane 5) or anti-hnRNP LL (lanes 6 and 7). Taken together with the previous finding that hnRNP L selectively binds CA repeat elements and controls alternative splicing (26Hui J. Stangl K. Lane W.S. Bindereif A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Hui J. Hung L.H. Heiner M. Schreiner S. Neumuller N. Reither G. Haas S.A. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1988-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), these data suggest that hnRNP L is a CaRRE1 binding factor. An hnRNP L High Affinity CA Repeat Element Is Sufficient to Mediate CaMKIV- and hnRNP L Repression of Splicing in a Location-dependent Way—To isolate the role of hnRNP L and CA repeats from the influence of non-CA nucleotides of CaRRE1, we tested the effect of known hnRNP L binding simple CA repeats in CaMKIV-regulated splicing. We first replaced 17 nt of the CaRRE1 with a high or low affinity sequence of hnRNP L (27Hui J. Hung L.H. Heiner M. Schreiner S. Neumuller N. Reither G. Haas S.A. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1988-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) to make splicing reporters L1 and L1m (Fig. 2). These reporter plasmids were each cotransfected with constitutively active CaMKIV-dCT (IV) or kinase-dead mutant (CaMKIV-dCTK75E, IVm) into HEK293T cells, and inclusion of the middle exon was measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR (PCR for 25 cycles). Exon inclusion levels of both L1 and L1m reporters were similar to the DUP175ST when co-expressed with CaMKIVm (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 3, and 5), suggesting that the 17-nt L1 and L1m elements here are not constitutive splicing silencers. However, when co-expressed with CaMKIV, exon inclusion levels of the L1 reporter were reduced by 18% (Fig. 2, compare lanes 3 and 4), similarly as the CaRRE1 reporter DUP175ST (lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the L1m reporter did not respond to CaMKIV (lanes 5 and 6). Thus, the hnRNP L high affinity CA repeat element can specifically replace CaRRE1 in response to CaMKIV. To determine whether the L1 element is sufficient to mediate CaMKIV repression of exon inclusion outside of the 3′-splice site, we placed 20 nt of the original L1 sequence inside the middle exon or in the flanking introns of the CaMKIV-nonresponsive DUP175 (16Xie J. Black D.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 37Dominski Z. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and assayed its response to CaMKIV co-expression (Fig. 3A, reporters L2–L5). The middle exon was strongly repressed by CaMKIV only in the L3 reporter that contains the CA repeat in the exon nearby the upstream 3′-splice site (27% reduction, Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6) but not in any of the other reporters L2, L4, and L5 that contain CA repeats at other locations. Moreover, the repression was abolished by A to G mutations in the CA repeats (L3m, lane 8). In comparison to CaMKIV, coexpressed protein kinase A barely reduced the exon inclusion of the L3 reporter (lane 14). Therefore, the high affinity hnRNP L binding CA repeat element confers CaMKIV-specific repression of exon inclusion in a location-dependent way. To determine whether hnRNP L is also able to repress exon inclusion through the CA repeats, we overexpressed hnRNP L-FLAG (L) with the vector DUP175 or the CA repeat-containing splicing reporters L1-L5 (Fig. 3C) with YB-1 (Y), another splicing factor known to interact with A/C-rich elements (49Stickeler E. Fraser S.D. Honig A. Chen A.L. Berget S.M. Cooper T.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), as a control. Similar to CaMKIV, hnRNP L-FLAG coexpression strongly repressed inclusion of the middle exon of reporters L1 and L3 (lanes 4 and 10) but not of DUP175, L2, L4, and L5 (lanes 2, 8, 14, and 16), neither of the CA repeat mutants (lanes 6 and 12). In contrast, YB-1 coexpression did not change the splicing of any reporter (Y, odd-numbered lanes). Therefore, overexpressed hnRNP L specifically represses exon inclusion through the CA repeats, with the same location dependence as CaMKIV. hnRNP L Mediates CaMKIV Repression of Splicing through the hnRNP L High Affinity CA Repeat Element Nearby the 3′-Splice Site—To determine whether hnRNP L is essential for the CaMKIV-regulated splicing, we examined the response of reporter L3 to CaMKIV without or with hnRNP L depletion by RNA interference (RNAi, Fig. 4). Exon inclusion of this L3 reporter was again reduced by CaMKIV in cells without hnRNP L depletion (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–4). In contrast, when the endogenous hnRNP L was effectively depleted by RNAi (11% protein left, lane 5, compared with controls), the L3 reporter lost its response to CaMKIV (96% ± 1.0 exon inclusion, n = 4, lane 5). Importantly, coexpression of the exogenous hnRNP L-FLAG protein in the RNAi cells restored the CaMKIV repression of the middle exon inclusion (lane 6). Thus, the loss of CaMKIV repression of exon inclusion by RNAi is indeed due to the specific depletion of hnRNP L. To confirm hnRNP L binding to the CA repeats as to the CaRRE1, we cross-linked RNA transcripts containing the CA repeats or its mutant with HeLa or HEK nuclear extracts. The wild type transcript was strongly cross-linked to an ∼65-kDa protein (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 6). Mutating A to G in the CA repeats almost abolished this protein band (lanes 3 and 7). Importantly, this protein was specifically immunoprecipitated by the antibody"
https://openalex.org/W1995338261,"Clostridium perfringens produces numerous toxins, which are responsible for severe diseases in man and animals. Delta toxin is one of the three hemolysins released by a number of C. perfringens type C and possibly type B strains. Delta toxin was characterized to be cytotoxic for cells expressing the ganglioside G(M2) in their membrane. Here we report the genetic characterization of Delta toxin and its pore forming activity in lipid bilayers. Delta toxin consists of 318 amino acids, its 28 N-terminal amino acids corresponding to a signal peptide. The secreted Delta toxin (290 amino acids; 32619 Da) is a basic protein (pI 9.1) which shows a significant homology with C. perfringens Beta toxin (43% identity), with C. perfringens NetB (40% identity) and, to a lesser extent, with Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin and leukotoxins. Recombinant Delta toxin showed a preference for binding to G(M2), in contrast to Beta toxin, which did not bind to gangliosides. It is hemolytic for sheep red blood cells and cytotoxic for HeLa cells. In artificial diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine membranes, Delta and Beta toxin formed channels. Conductance of the channels formed by Delta toxin, with a value of about 100 pS to more than 1 nS in 1 M KCl and a membrane potential of 20 mV, was higher than those formed by Beta toxin and their distribution was broader. The results of zero-current membrane potential measurements and single channel experiments suggest that Delta toxin forms slightly anion-selective channels, whereas the Beta toxin channels showed a preference for cations under the same conditions. C. perfringens Delta toxin shows a significant sequence homolgy with C. perfringens Beta and NetB toxins, as well as with S. aureus alpha hemolysin and leukotoxins, but exhibits different channel properties in lipid bilayers. In contrast to Beta toxin, Delta toxin recognizes G(M2) as receptor and forms anion-selective channels."

The reaction takes place at the active site, which is composed of a nickel and an iron atom and three diatomic ligands, two cyanides and one carbon monoxide, bound to the iron. The NiFe(CN-)2CO cofactor is synthesized by an intricate posttranslational maturation process, which is mediated by a set of six conserved Hyp proteins. Depending on the cellular location and the physiological function, additional auxiliary proteins are involved in hydrogenase biosynthesis. Here we present evidence that the auxiliary proteins HoxL and HoxV assist in assembly of the Fe(CN-)2CO moiety.

They have been classified according to their metal content in di-iron [FeFe], nickel-iron [NiFe], and monoiron [Fe] hydrogenases (2Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Chem. Rev.. 2007; 107: 4206-4272Google Scholar). This study focuses on one member of the group of [NiFe] hydrogenases, which consists of a Ni-Fe active site-containing large subunit, a Fe-S cluster-accommodating, electron-transferring small subunit, and a membrane-spanning cytochrome b. The Ni-Fe cofactor is coordinated to the protein via thiol groups originating from four invariant cysteine residues, two of which form a bridge between nickel and iron. The iron is additionally equipped with two CN- groups and one CO ligand, which confer a low spin state on the iron (3Volbeda A. Garcin E. Piras C. de Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M.

According to the current model, predominantly based on studies with hydrogenase 3 from Escherichia coli, a carbamoyl group is transferred from carbamoylphosphate via HypF to the thiol group of the C-terminal cysteine in HypE. Upon dehydration, a HypE-thiocyanate complex is formed, and subsequently the CN- ligand is transmitted to an iron exposed on a HypC-D complex (10Paschos A. Bauer A. Zimmermann A. Zehelein E. Böck A.

A dual chaperone function was assigned to these two proteins: protection of the Fe-S clusters against oxidative damage and avoidance of premature MBH export, which is mediated by the twin-arginine-translocation system (31Schubert T. Lenz O. Krause E. Volkmer R. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol.. 2007; 66: 453-467Google Scholar). The present study focuses on the role of HoxL and HoxV in the process of MBH maturation. HoxL is a HypC paralogue (23Kortlüke C. Horstmann K. Schwartz E. Rohde M. Binsack R. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol.. 1992; 174: 6277-6289Google Scholar), of which multiple copies exist in a number of organisms (32Blokesch M. Magalon A. Böck A. J. Bacteriol.. 2001; 183: 2817-2822Google Scholar, 33Maroti G. Fodor B.D. Rakhely G. Kovacs A.T. Arvani S. Kovacs K.L. Eur. J. Biochem.. 2003; 270: 2218-2227Google Scholar). HoxV and orthologous proteins display sequence similarity to the large subunit of [NiFe] hydrogenases (34Imperial J. Rey L. Palacios J.M. Ruiz-Argueso T. Mol. Microbiol.. 1993; 9: 1305-1306Google Scholar). In this study, experimental evidence is presented that HoxL and HoxV participate specifically in the maturation of the large subunit of the Re MBH. Biochemical and spectroscopic evidence supports the notion that HoxV functions as a scaffold delivering the Fe(CN-)2CO moiety to the precursor of the MBH large subunit pre-HoxG, whereas copurification experiments indicate that HoxL plays a role as a chaperone dedicated to pre-HoxG.

The StrepTag II sequence was fused to the 3′-end of hoxG by PCR with primers CtermStrep-hoxG_RsrII-rev and CtermStrep-hoxG_RsrII-fwd with pCH1235 as template, which is a religated 4.20-kbp BsiWI fragment of pCH1229 (carrying parts of hoxG and hoxZ), resulting in a 4.24-kbp fragment. The PCR product was digested with RsrII and religated, yielding pCH1238. A 1.10-kbp BsaBI-AsiSI fragment was transferred from pCH1238 into pCH1351, yielding pCH1239. Then a 9.06-kbp SpeI-Ecl136II fragment from pCH1239 was inserted into pCH785, resulting in pCH1240, and a 21.60-kbp SpeI-XbaI fragment was transferred from pCH1240 into pEDY309, yielding pGE609. The mobilizable overexpression plasmid was transferred from E. coli S17–1 to Re HF631, yielding strain HF686. A StrepTag II fusion to hoxL was constructed as follows. Using primers CtermStrep-hoxL_NheI-fwd and CtermStrep-hoxL_NheI-rev, the StrepTag II sequence was fused to the 3′-end of hoxL by inverse PCR with pCH1136 as template, a pBluescriptII KS+ derivative harboring a 2-kbp Ecl136II-MfeI fragment of pCH462 in Ecl136II-EcoRI sites. The resulting PCR product was cut with NheI and religated, resulting in pCH1137, from which a 1.4-kbp XhoI fragment was transferred to SalI-digested pLO2, yielding pCH1138. Finally, pCH1138 was transferred to Re HF632 by conjugation, and the mutation was introduced by allele exchange (37Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol.. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Google Scholar), resulting in strain HF656. The StrepTag II fusion of HoxV was constructed by inverse PCR with primers NtermStrep-hoxV_NheI-fwd and NtermStrep-hoxV_NheI-rev with pCH305 as template. The NheI-digested PCR product was religated, yielding pCH1287. A 0.7-kbp SphI-SalI fragment from pCH1287 was transferred to pLO2, yielding pCH1288. Finally, pCH1288 was transferred into HF632, and the mutation was introduced by allele exchange (37Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol.. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Google Scholar), yielding HF714. Amino acid exchanges were introduced into hoxV using PCR on a subcloned hoxV sequence; a 4.16-kbp SalI fragment carrying the hoxTVhypA1B1F1C region from pCH785 was subcloned into pBluescript KS+, resulting in pCH1355. A 199-bp FseI-MscI fragment from the PCR product with primers hoxV_FseI-fwd, hoxV_MscI-rev, and hoxV_C52S-rev, with pCH785 as template, was transferred into pCH1355, yielding pCH1356. BspEI-Ecl136II fragments (159 bp) from PCR products with primers hoxV_BspEI-fwd, hypA1_SacI-rev, and hoxV_C366S-fwd or hoxV_Y369C-fwd with pCH785 as template were transferred into pCH1351, yielding pCH1357 and pCH1358, respectively. SpeI-Ecl136II fragments (9.02 kbp) from pCH1357 and pCH1358 were transferred to pCH785, yielding pCH1359 and pCH1360, respectively. SalI fragments (4.16 kbp) from pCH1356, pCH1359, and pCH1360 were transferred into pLO2, yielding pCH1361, pCH1362, and pCH1363, respectively. The respective mutations were introduced into R. eutropha by conjugational transfer of pCH1361, pCH1362, and pCH1363 into HF388 and allele exchange (37Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol.. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Google Scholar), resulting in HF742, HF743, and HF744, respectively. A 3.78-kbp FseI (Klenow-treated)-SalI fragment of pCH1359 was cloned into EcoRV-SalI-digested pLO2, yielding pCH1400. A 455-bp FseI-NcoI fragment of pCH1356 was transferred into pCH1287, yielding pCH1401, and a 1.31-kbp EcoRV-Ecl136II fragment of pCH1401 was cloned into pLO2, resulting in pCH1402. The respective mutations (hoxV C52S and C366S) were introduced into R. eutropha by conjugational transfer of pCH1402 and pCH1400 into HF752 and allele exchange (37Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol.. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Google Scholar), resulting in HF761 and HF762, respectively. In frame deletions in hoxG, hoxM, hoxL, hoxV, hypD, and hyp1 were introduced in the respective strains by allele exchange (37Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol.. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Google Scholar) using plasmids pCH424, pCH411, pCH464, pCH430, pCH1304, and pCH547, respectively. A 1.11-kbp PstI-MscI fragment from pCH375 cloned into PstI-EcoRV-digested pLO2 yielded pCH1304. Media and Growth Conditions—Strains of Re were grown in Luria broth medium containing 0.25% (w/v) sodium chloride (LSLB) or in mineral salts medium (38Schlegel H.G. Kaltwasser H. Gottschalk G. Arch. Mikrobiol.. 1961; 38: 209-222Google Scholar). Sucrose-resistant segregants of sacB-harboring strains were selected on LSLB plates containing 15% (w/v) sucrose (37Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol.. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Google Scholar). Strains of E. coli were grown in Luria broth medium (39Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Solid media contained 1.5% (w/v) agar. Antibiotics for Re were used at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 350 μgml-1; tetracycline, 15 μgml-1. Antibiotics for E. coli were used at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 25 μgml-1; tetracycline, 15 μgml-1; ampicillin, 100 μgml-1. When cultivated on a small scale (0.1–1-liter culture volume), cells were grown under hydrogenase-derepressing conditions in mineral salts medium containing 0.2% fructose and 0.2% glycerol at continuous shaking at 120 rpm (40Schwartz E. Gerischer U. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol.. 1998; 180: 3197-3204Google Scholar). For large-scale purifications, cells were grown in a fermenter (Biostat MD; Braun) at continuous stirring at 400 rpm. Cells were harvested (centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min) after 48 h of cultivation at 30 °C at an A436 of about 10. Preparation of Membrane Fraction and Soluble Extract—The cell pellets resulting from 100-ml cultures were resuspended in 2 ml of K-PO4 buffer (50 mM, K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.0), DNase I was added (20 μg). The cells were disrupted using a French pressure cell (SLM Aminco) and centrifuged (4000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min to separate the membrane fraction from soluble extract. The membrane fraction was homogenized in an appropriate volume of 50 mm K-PO4 buffer (pH 7.0), ultracentrifuged again at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and homogenized in 200 μl50 mm K-PO4 buffer (pH 7.0). Protein Purification—For purification of StrepTag II-tagged proteins, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl (washing buffer) per 1 g of cell material, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science) was added. The cells were disrupted using a French pressure cell (SLM Aminco), and the crude extract was ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 45 min). The supernatant was loaded on StrepTactin Superflow columns (2.5-ml columns, 1-ml bed volume; MoBiTec) equilibrated with washing buffer (maximum 25 ml of solubilized membrane extract per column). In the case of large scale preparations (60 g of cell material), the StrepTactin matrix (4 ml) was added to the soluble extract. After stirring for 1 h on ice, the suspension was transferred to two 10-ml columns (MoBiTec). The columns were washed with 12 column volumes of washing buffer and eluted with elution buffer (washing buffer, 5 mm desthiobiotin). The protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (Amicon Ultra-15 (PL-10 or PL-30); Millipore). For Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, the protein solution was further concentrated using Amicon Microcon (YM-30) (Millipore). For metal determination of HoxV, the eluate after the StrepTactin column was further purified using gel filtration (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 preparation grade column; Amersham Biosciences). HoxV-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 (PL-30) and Microcon (YM-30). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem.. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of the samples was examined by SDS-PAGE (42Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Hydrogenase activity in the membrane fraction was measured as described previously (21Schink B. Schlegel H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1979; 567: 315-324Google Scholar) in 50 mm K-PO4 buffer at pH 7.0. Methylene blue was used as an artificial electron acceptor, and its absorption at 570 nm was measured spectrophotometrically. Western Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were resolved using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (42Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Western immunoblot analysis was performed according to a standard protocol (43Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). For immunological detection of hydrogenase-related proteins, antisera were applied in the following dilutions: anti-HoxG serum (1:10,000), anti-HypC serum (1:500 dilution), and anti-HypD serum (1:500 dilution). Antibodies directed against the MBH accessory proteins HoxL and HoxV were produced by rabbit immunization with the respective proteins, purified under denaturing conditions. Infrared and EPR Spectroscopy—Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector at a spectral resolution of 2 cm-1. The sample compartment was purged with dried air, and the sample (0.66–1.83 mm protein) was held in a temperature-controlled (10 °C) gas-tight liquid cell (volume ∼7 μl, path length = 50 μm) with CaF2 windows. Spectra were baseline-corrected by using a spline function implemented within OPUS 4.2 software supplied by Bruker. The spectra shown in this work were normalized with respect to the protein concentration. Attempts to reduce the samples were carried out with excess dithionite under anaerobic conditions. EPR spectroscopy was performed as described in Ref. 44Buhrke T. Löscher S. Lenz O. Schlodder E. Zebger I. Andersen L.K. Hildebrandt P. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H"
https://openalex.org/W2075777498,"Human Dicer is an integral component of the RNA interference pathway. Dicer processes premicro-RNA and double-strand RNA to, respectively, mature micro-RNA and short interfering RNA (siRNA) and transfers the processed products to the RNA-induced silencing complex. To better understand the factors that are important for the binding, translocation, and selective recognition of the siRNA strands, we determined the binding affinities of human Dicer for processed products (siRNA) and short single-strand RNAs (ssRNA). siRNAs and ssRNAs competitively inhibited human Dicer activity, suggesting that they are interacting with the active site of the enzyme. The dissociation constants (Kd) for unmodified siRNAs were 5-11-fold weaker compared with a 27-nucleotide double-strand RNA substrate. Chemically modified siRNAs exhibited binding affinities for Dicer comparable with the substrate. 3′-Dinucleotide overhangs in the siRNA affected the binding affinity of human Dicer for the siRNA and biased strand loading into RNA-induced silencing complex. The Kd values for the ssRNAs ranged from 3- to 40-fold weaker than the Kd for the substrate. Sequence composition of the 3′-terminal nucleotides of the ssRNAs exhibited the greatest effect on Dicer binding. Dicer cleaved substrates containing short siRNA-like double-strand regions and extended 3′ or 5′ ssRNA overhangs in the adjacent ssRNA regions. Remarkably, cleavage sites were observed consistent with the enzyme entering the substrate from the extended 3′ ssRNA terminus. These data suggest that the siRNAs and ssRNAs interact predominantly with the PAZ domain of the enzyme. Finally, the tightest binding siRNAs were also more potent inhibitors of gene expression. Human Dicer is an integral component of the RNA interference pathway. Dicer processes premicro-RNA and double-strand RNA to, respectively, mature micro-RNA and short interfering RNA (siRNA) and transfers the processed products to the RNA-induced silencing complex. To better understand the factors that are important for the binding, translocation, and selective recognition of the siRNA strands, we determined the binding affinities of human Dicer for processed products (siRNA) and short single-strand RNAs (ssRNA). siRNAs and ssRNAs competitively inhibited human Dicer activity, suggesting that they are interacting with the active site of the enzyme. The dissociation constants (Kd) for unmodified siRNAs were 5-11-fold weaker compared with a 27-nucleotide double-strand RNA substrate. Chemically modified siRNAs exhibited binding affinities for Dicer comparable with the substrate. 3′-Dinucleotide overhangs in the siRNA affected the binding affinity of human Dicer for the siRNA and biased strand loading into RNA-induced silencing complex. The Kd values for the ssRNAs ranged from 3- to 40-fold weaker than the Kd for the substrate. Sequence composition of the 3′-terminal nucleotides of the ssRNAs exhibited the greatest effect on Dicer binding. Dicer cleaved substrates containing short siRNA-like double-strand regions and extended 3′ or 5′ ssRNA overhangs in the adjacent ssRNA regions. Remarkably, cleavage sites were observed consistent with the enzyme entering the substrate from the extended 3′ ssRNA terminus. These data suggest that the siRNAs and ssRNAs interact predominantly with the PAZ domain of the enzyme. Finally, the tightest binding siRNAs were also more potent inhibitors of gene expression. Post-transcriptional gene silencing by the mechanism known as RNA interference involves the processing of long double-strand RNAs (dsRNA) 2The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-strand RNA; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ssRNA, single-strand RNA; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; RLC, RISC loading complex; TRBP, transactivating response RNA-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; 3′-32PCp, 32P-labeled cytidine bisphosphate; pCp, unlabeled cytidine bisphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin. 2The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-strand RNA; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ssRNA, single-strand RNA; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; RLC, RISC loading complex; TRBP, transactivating response RNA-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; 3′-32PCp, 32P-labeled cytidine bisphosphate; pCp, unlabeled cytidine bisphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin. into short effector dsRNAs by the RNase III enzyme, Dicer (1Fire A.

Human cells contain a single Dicer isoform, which has been shown to generate both short interfering RNAs (siRNA) and mature micro-RNA products (3Grishok A. Pasquinelli A.E. Conte D. Li N. Parrish S.

Science.. 2001; 293: 2269-2271Google Scholar). siRNA and micro-RNA consist of sense and antisense strands relative to the target mRNA. The siRNA and micro-RNA products of Dicer are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), resulting in either the translational repression or destruction of the mRNA target (7Zamore P.D. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P. Cell.. 2000; 101: 25-33Google Scholar, 8Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev.. 2001; 15: 188-200Google Scholar, 9Hammond S.M. Bernstein E. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Nature.. 2000; 404: 293-296Google Scholar). Dicer belongs to the RNase III family of enzymes and appears to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes. The enzyme is a 220-kDa protein consisting of a dsRNA-binding domain, a PAZ domain, two RNase III domains, and a domain homologous to ATP-dependent RNA helicase (10Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Brondani V. Billy E. Filipowicz W. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 5875-5885Google Scholar, 11Billy E. Brondani V. Zhang H. Muller U. Filipowicz W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell.. 2004; 118: 57-68Google Scholar). The two RNase III domains of Dicer form an intramolecular dimer that together cleave the opposing strands of the dsRNA, generating 2-nucleotide-long 3′-overhangs (13Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Jaskiewicz L. Westhof E. Filipowicz W. Cell.. 2004; 118: 57-68Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Dicer from Giardia showed that the PAZ domain of the enzyme exhibited a tertiary structure similar to the PAZ domain of human Argonaute2 (14MacRae I.J. Zhou K. Fei L. Repic A. Brooks A.N. Cande W.Z. Adams P.D. Doudna J.A. Science.. 2006; 311: 195-198Google Scholar). In addition, the hydrophobic pocket of the PAZ domain was responsible for binding the 3′-dinucleotide overhang of the substrate (14MacRae I.J. Zhou K. Fei L. Repic A. Brooks A.N. Cande W.Z. Adams P.D. Doudna J.A. Science.. 2006; 311: 195-198Google Scholar). The PAZ and RNase III domains are separated by an α-helix that functions as a molecular ruler to generate the ∼20-base pair dsRNA products (14MacRae I.J. Zhou K. Fei L. Repic A. Brooks A.N. Cande W.Z. Adams P.D. Doudna J.A. Science.. 2006; 311: 195-198Google Scholar). Finally, the role of the ATPase/RNA helicase domain of the enzyme is unclear, since no helicase activity has been observed for the enzyme (10Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Brondani V. Billy E. Filipowicz W. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 5875-5885Google Scholar). Dicer is a key component of the RISC loading complex (RLC) (2Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature.. 2001; 409: 363-366Google Scholar, 3Grishok A. Pasquinelli A.E. Conte D. Li N. Parrish S. Ha I. Baillie D.L. Fire A. Ruvkun G. Mello C.C. Cell.. 2001; 106: 23-24Google Scholar, 4Hutvagner G.

The minimum RLC consists of human Dicer and the human immunodeficiency virus transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP) (16Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science.. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Google Scholar, 17Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R. Nature.. 2005; 436: 740-744Google Scholar). The role of the RLC in the activities of siRNAs is unclear. Several studies showed that the reduction of either human Dicer or TRBP protein expression reduced the activities of siRNAs (17Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R. Nature.. 2005; 436: 740-744Google Scholar, 18Doi N. Zenno S. Ueda R. Ohki-Hamazaki H. Ui-Tei K. Saigo K. Curr. Biol.. 2003; 13: 41-46Google Scholar). Other studies showed that a reduction in Dicer protein expression appeared to have no effect on siRNA activity (19Vickers T.A. Lima W.F. Nichols J.G. Crooke S.T. Nucleic Acids Res.. 2007; 35: 6598-6610Google Scholar, 20Kanellopoulou C. Muljo S.A. Kung A.L. Ganesan S. Drapkin R. Jenuwein T. Livingston D.M. Rajewsky A.K. Genes Dev.. 2005; 19: 489-501Google Scholar). In addition, synthetic Dicer substrates ranging from 25 to 30 nucleotides were shown to be more potent inhibitors of gene expression than the corresponding 21-nucleotide siRNAs, further suggesting a role for human Dicer in the activities of siRNAs (21Kim D.H. Behlke M.A. Rose S.D. Chang M.S. Choi S. Rossi J.J. Nat. Biotechnol.. 2005; 23: 222-226Google Scholar). In Drosophila, cross-linking studies between Dicer-2 and the TRBP paralog R2D2 bound to the siRNA indicated that Dicer-2 was positioned adjacent to the 5′ terminus of the sense strand, and R2D2 was positioned adjacent the 5′ terminus of the antisense strand (22Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science.. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Google Scholar). The directionality of the interaction appeared to be influenced by the base-pairing stabilities of the siRNA termini (22Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science.. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Google Scholar). Similarly, substrates containing 3′-overhangs were determined to affect the directionality of human Dicer cleavage as well as the gene silencing activities of the siRNAs (23Rose S.D. Kim D.H. Amarzguioui M. Heidel J.D. Collingwood M.A. Davis M.E. Rossi J.J. Behlke M.A. Nucleic Acids Res.. 2005; 33: 4140-4156Google Scholar). Together, these data suggested that Dicer participates in the translocation of the cleavage product to RISC and that binding directionality between the enzyme and the product plays a role in the selective loading of the siRNA strands into RISC. The substrate specificity of human Dicer has been characterized. The enzyme cleaves long double-strand RNA substrates from either terminus, producing cleavage products that are typically 21-25 base pairs long (10Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Brondani V. Billy E. Filipowicz W. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 5875-5885Google Scholar). Substrates containing 3′-overhangs exhibited faster cleavage rates compared with substrates with blunt termini, although both substrates exhibited similar binding affinities for the enzyme (24Vermeulen A. Behlen L. Reynolds A. Wolfson A. Marshall W.S. Karpilow J. Khvorova A. RNA.. 2005; 11: 674-682Google Scholar). The sequence composition of the 3′-overhangs as well as the length of the overhangs also affected the rate of cleavage, with no cleavage observed for overhangs longer than 3 ribonucleotides (24Vermeulen A. Behlen L. Reynolds A. Wolfson A. Marshall W.S. Karpilow J. Khvorova A. RNA.. 2005; 11: 674-682Google Scholar). It is surprising, given that the enzyme is believed to participate in the translocation of the products to RISC that much less is known about the interaction between human Dicer and siRNA products it produces. Provost et al. (25Provost P. Dishart D. Doucet J. Friendewey D. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 5864-5874Google Scholar) showed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay Dicer did not bind siRNA, suggesting that the enzyme may not be directly involved in the translocation of the products of Dicer cleavage (siRNAs) into RISC. Thus, there is a need to resolve the issue of whether Dicer indeed translocates siRNA to RISC and how this is accomplished. To better understand the interaction between human Dicer and its siRNA cleavage products as well as the properties important for the translocation of the siRNA from Dicer to RISC, we determined the binding affinities of human Dicer for substrate and various native and chemically modified siRNAs and short single-strand RNAs (ssRNA). Based on the observed binding interactions between the enzyme and the siRNAs and ssRNAs, substrates containing short siRNA-like double-strand regions and extended 3′ or 5′ single-strand RNA regions were prepared, and the Dicer cleavage activities were determined. Finally, we compared the gene silencing activities of various modified and unmodified siRNAs in cultured cells with the binding affinities of human Dicer for the siRNAs. Preparation of Oligonucleotides and 32P-Labeled Substrate—Synthetic oligoribonucleotides were manufactured by Dharmacon Research, Inc. siRNA duplexes were formed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The double (siRNA) and single strand (ssRNA) structures of the oligoribonucleotides were confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The alternating 2′-fluoro-, 2′-methoxy-modified oligonucleotides were prepared as previously described (26Allerson C.R. Sioufi N. Jarres R. Prakash T.P. Naik N. Berdeja A. Wanders L. Griffey R.H. Swayze E.E. Bhat B. J. Med. Chem.. 2005; 48: 901-904Google Scholar). The final concentration of the duplex was 20 μm in 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. The 27-base pair RNA substrate was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and standard procedures (27Ausubel F.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York1988: 3.10.3Google Scholar). The labeled substrate was purified on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The specific activity of the labeled oligonucleotide was ∼3000-8000 cpm/fmol. Preparation of Recombinant Human Dicer—The human Dicer cDNA clone was purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). The GST and His tags were engineered into the N and C termini of the cDNA of the pcDNA3.1/V5-HIS plasmid (OriGene Technologies). The GST-Dicer-His cDNA was then subcloned into the pENTR 2B plasmid (Invitrogen). The plasmid was recombined with the BaculoDirect Linear DNA to create the BaculoVirus expressing GST- and His-tagged human Dicer in sf9 cells. The virus was amplified and transfected into sf9 cells. The cells were harvested 3 days following transfection, and lysate was subjected to two affinity purifications. First, His tag affinity purification with the Talon column (Clontech) and elution of the enzyme with 80 mm imidazole and 80 mm EDTA were performed. Second, the eluant was GST affinity-purified with the GST column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the Dicer protein was more then 95%. Multiple-turnover Kinetics—The 27-base pair RNA substrate ranging in concentration from 100 nm to 10 μm was digested with 200 ng of human Dicer in cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. At times of 2-120 min, a 10-μl aliquot of the cleavage reaction was quenched with 5 μl of stop solution (8 m urea and 120 mm EDTA). Cleavage reactions were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitated on an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. The concentration of the converted product was plotted as a function of time. The initial cleavage rate was obtained from the slope (mol of RNA cleaved/min) of the best fit line for the linear portion of the plot, which comprises in general <10% of the total reaction and data from at least five time points. Alternatively, cleavage products were analyzed by ion pair HPLC electrospray mass spectrometry. Specifically, samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted and injected directly on a Waters XBridge column (Waters, Milford, MA). Separation was accomplished using an Agilent 1100 HPLC-mass spectrometry system (Agilent, Wilmington, DE). The column was maintained at 55 °C, and flow rate on the column was 0.25 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with 35% acetonitrile in 5 mm tributylammonium acetate, pH 7.0. A gradient from 35 to 80% acetonitrile over 15 min was used to elute the RNA duplex and dicer processing products, and the single strands were detected in the mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were obtained using a spray voltage of 4 kV, a sheath gas flow of 35 p.s.i.g., a drying gas flow rate of 12 liters/min at 325 °C, and a capillary voltage of -125 V. under these conditions, oligonucleotides ranging in length from 15 to 27 nucleotides are detected in the -4 and -5 charge state. Chromatograms and mass spectra were analyzed using Agilent Chemstation software. Each peak was manually averaged for its m/z value, and the results were compared with a table containing the calculated m/z values of expected Dicer products. Determination of Dissociation Constants (Kd)—Binding affinities were determined by inhibition analysis. Here, the initial cleavages rates were determined for the 27-base pair RNA substrate at a variety of concentrations in both the presence and absence of a competing noncleavable substrate analog (i.e. siRNA, ssRNA, and dsDNA), as described for multiple-turnover kinetics. The dsRNA substrate was prepared as described above except in 50 μl of cleavage buffer with final concentrations ranging from 200 to 800 nm. The competing noncleavable substrate analog was prepared in 50 μl of hybridization buffer ranging in concentration from 1 to 10 μm. The reactions were digested with human Dicer, quenched, analyzed, and quantitated as described for multiple-turnover kinetics. The equation, Ki = [inhibitor]/((slopeinhibitor/slopesubstrate) - 1) was used to calculate the inhibition constant (Ki). Ki equals the dissociation constant (Kd) when the competitor is a noncleavable substrate. siRNA Treatment—HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (0.1 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). Treatment of cells with siRNA was performed using Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 2-5 μg/ml Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 3-5 h at 37 °C, as described previously. For the generation of IC50 curves, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 4000-6000 cells/well and then treated at doses ranging from 2 pm to 60 nm in half-log serial dilutions. Treated cells were incubated overnight. The next day, total RNA was purified from 96-well plates using an RNeasy 3000 BioRobot (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reduction of target mRNA expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. mRNA levels were normalized to total RNA for each sample as measured by Ribogreen (Invitrogen). IC50 curves and values were generated using Prism 4 software (GraphPad). Immunoprecipitation of Overexpressed Ago2 for the RISC Activity Assay—The cDNA of human Ago2 with an N-terminal HA epitope was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector phCMV-2. HeLa cells (CCL-2) were treated with the Ago2 expression plasmid using Effectene transfection reagent. 24 h later, cells were treated with 75 nm synthetic oligoribonucleotides or siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and incubated for an additional 18 h. Cells were harvested with trypsin and washed twice with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris at pH 7.5, protease inhibitor, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and passed through an insulin syringe. Supernatants were clarified with a 10,000 × g clearing spin for 10 min, and protein concentrations were determined. 1.8 mg of total protein was incubated with 15 μl of HA II beads (Covance) for 2 h, washed three times with lysis buffer, and equilibrated in cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). 0.1 nm32P-labeled target RNA was added, and cleavage reactions quenched at the specified times in gel loading buffer (Ambion). Cleavage reactions were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitated with an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. siRNA and ssRNA Are Competitive Inhibitors of Dicer Substrate—Kd values for substrate, the cleavage products of Dicer (siRNA), and short ssRNA were determined by inhibition analysis. We chose inhibition analysis for several reasons. First, this method allows the measurement of a wide range of dissociation constants, including weaker binding affinities (i.e. those in the high nanomolar to micromolar range) (28Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 390-398Google Scholar). Second, this method provides information about the nature of the enzyme/ligand interaction. Specifically, the type of inhibition, (e.g. competitive, uncompetitive, noncompetitive) gives an indication of whether the inhibitor is binding to the reactive site on the enzyme, modifying the substrate, or causing an allosteric effect on the enzyme. Lineweaver-Burk and Augustinsson analysis of the data were used to determine the inhibitory constant (Ki), and the Ki is equivalent to the Kd of the enzyme when a noncleavable inhibitor is used (28Lima W.F. Crooke S.T. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 390-398Google Scholar). The enzyme cleaved the 27-base pair substrate, generating 21-25-base pair products (Figs. 1 and 2A). To determine the binding affinity of human Dicer for substrate, a 27-base pair noncleavable substrate was prepared with 2′-methoxyribonucleotide substitutions at the cleavage sites (Fig. 2A). No human Dicer cleavage activity was observed for the noncleavable 27-base pair duplex containing 2′-methoxy substitutions, the 19-base pair siRNA (si92), or the 19-nucleotide single-strand RNA (s92) (Fig. 2A). Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the initial cleavage rates for the 27-base pair RNA substrate in the presence and absence of the si92 siRNA or s92 single-strand RNA demonstrated that si92 and s92 were competitive inhibitors of the 27-base pair substrate (Fig. 2, B and C). The noncleavable 27-base pair duplex containing 2′-methoxy ribonucleotide substitutions at the cleavage sites also functioned as competitive inhibitor of the 27-base pair substrate (data not shown). The Kd values for the noncleavable 27-base pair duplex, si92, and s92 were 47, 451, and 154 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2siRNA and single-strand RNA are competitive inhibitors of human Dicer substrate.

Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science.. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Google Scholar). To evaluate the effects of thermodynamic stabilities of the terminal base pairs on the interaction with the enzyme, we designed 19-base pair siRNAs containing terminal base pairs predicted to exhibit similar (si92) and asymmetrical (si97) thermodynamic stabilities and siRNAs with various types of overhangs (Table 1).TABLE 1Dissociation constants for human Dicer binding to siRNA constructs Open table in a new tab The dissociation constants for the 19-base pair si92 and si97 duplexes were ∼7-12-fold weaker compared with the Kd for the 27-base pair noncleavable substrate (Table 1A and Fig. 2A). Dicer exhibited a slightly tighter binding affinity for the si97 duplex with G:C and A:U base pairs at the termini, compared with the si92 duplex with A:U terminal base pairs (Table 1A). The 5′-phosphate appeared to have no effect on Dicer binding, since comparable dissociation constants were also observed for the si92 duplexes containing 5′-phosphates (si92/s5′-PO, si92/as5′-PO, and si92/s:as5′-PO) and the si92 siRNA (Table 1A). Similarly, comparable binding affinities were observed for the si97 duplex containing a 5′-phosphate (si97/as5′-PO) and the si97 siRNA (Table 1A). Finally, human Dicer exhibited a significantly weaker binding affinity for the double-strand deoxyribonucleotide duplex (si92/DNA) compared with si92. To explore the effects of the dinucleotide 3′-overhang on Dicer binding, a series of duplexes was prepared in which purine and pyrimidine ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide overhangs were positioned at either the 3′ or 5′ terminus of the sense and antisense strands of the si92 and si97 duplexes (Table 1B). The duplexes containing 5′-dinucleotide overhangs exhibited Kd values comparable with the length-matched si92 duplex, suggesting that the 5′-overhangs have no effect on the binding affinity of human Dicer for the siRNA (Table 1B). The position of the 3′-overhang (e.g. 3′ terminus of the sense strand verses the antisense strand) of the siRNA appeared to have a greater influence on human Dicer binding compared with the nucleotide composition of the 3′-overhang. Specifically, human Dicer exhibited a 2-7-fold tighter binding affinity for the si92 duplexes containing the 3′-diribonucleotide overhang in the antisense strand compared with the si92 duplexes with the 3′-overhang in the sense strand (Table 1B). In contrast, varying the dinucleotide composition in the 3′-overhang of the antisense strand resulted in only a 2-fold difference in binding affinity. Similarly, a maximum 2-fold difference in binding affinity was observed for the various nucleotide combinations at the 3′-overhang of the sense strand. (Table 1B). Finally, the influence of the 3′-overhang on human Dicer binding appears to be independent of duplex sequence. For example, a tighter binding affinity was also observed for the si97 duplex containing the thymidine deoxyribonucleotide overhang at the 3′ terminus of the antisense strand (si97/as3′-dTdT) compared with the duplex overhang at the 3′-terminus of the sense strand (si97/s3′-dTdT) (Table 1B). Taken together, these data suggest that although the thermodynamic stability of the terminal base pairs plays a role, the dinucleotide 3′-overhangs exhibit a greater effect on human Dicer binding. Table 2 shows the binding affinities of human Dicer for single-strand RNAs. The binding affinities for the various single-strand oligonucleotides differed significantly compared with the siRNA duplexes. Specifically, human Dicer exhibited an ∼14-fold tighter binding affinity for the sense strand (s92) compared with the antisense strand (as92) of the si92 duplex (Table 2A). The tightest binding affinities were observed for the single-strand RNAs that contained purine dinucleotides at the 3′ terminus compared with single-strand RNAs with 3′-terminal pyrimidine dinucleotides. Remarkably, the binding affinity for s92 was only 3-fold weaker than the binding affinity for the noncleavable 27-base pair substrate (Table 2A). A similar trend was observed for the single-strand RNAs of the si97 duplex in which Dicer bound the sense strand tighter than the antisense strand, although a smaller 2′-fold difference in binding affinity was observed (Table 2B). The 2′-fluoro/2′-methoxy substitutions reversed the rank order for binding. Specifically, Dicer exhibited a 2-fold tighter binding affinity for the modified antisense strands (as92/2′-F/OMe and as97/2′-F/OMe) compared with the modified sense stands (s92/2′-F/OMe and s97/2′-F/OMe) (Table 2, A and B). Finally, significantly weaker binding affinities were observed for the single-strand RNAs containing thymidine deoxynucleotides at the 3′ termini of the sense and antisense strands (Table 2, A and B).TABLE 2Dissociation constants for human Dicer binding to single-strand RNAs Open table in a new tab To better understand the observ"
https://openalex.org/W1983438215,"Bone marrow (BM) derived vascular precursor cells (BM-PC, endothelial progenitors) are involved in normal and malignant angiogenesis, in ischemia and in wound healing. However, the mechanisms by which BM-PC stimulate the pre-existing endothelial cells at sites of vascular remodelling/recovery, and their contribution towards the formation of new blood vessels are still undisclosed. In the present report, we exploited the possibility that members of the Notch signalling pathway, expressed by BM-PC during endothelial differentiation, might regulate their pro-angiogenic or pro-wound healing properties. We demonstrate that Notch pathway modulates the adhesion of BM-PC to extracellular matrix (ECM) in vitro via regulation of integrin alpha3beta1; and that Notch pathway inhibition on BM-PC impairs their capacity to stimulate endothelial cell tube formation on matrigel and to promote endothelial monolayer recovery following wounding in vitro. Moreover, we show that activation of Notch pathway on BM-PC improved wound healing in vivo through angiogenesis induction. Conversely, inoculation of BM-PC pre-treated with a gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) into wounded mice failed to induce angiogenesis at the wound site and did not promote wound healing, presumably due to a lower frequency of BM-PC at the wound area. Our data suggests that Notch pathway regulates BM-PC adhesion to ECM at sites of vascular repair and that it also regulates the capacity of BM-PC to stimulate angiogenesis and to promote wound healing. Drug targeting of the Notch pathway on BM-PC may thus represent a novel strategy to modulate neo-angiogenesis and vessel repair."
https://openalex.org/W2008809020,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) is a recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in calpain 3 (CAPN3). Calpain 3 plays different roles in muscular cells, but little is known about its functions or in vivo substrates. The aim of this study was to identify the genes showing an altered expression in LGMD2A patients and the possible pathways they are implicated in. Ten muscle samples from LGMD2A patients with in which molecular diagnosis was ascertained were investigated using array technology to analyze gene expression profiling as compared to ten normal muscle samples. Upregulated genes were mostly those related to extracellular matrix (different collagens), cell adhesion (fibronectin), muscle development (myosins and melusin) and signal transduction. It is therefore suggested that different proteins located or participating in the costameric region are implicated in processes regulated by calpain 3 during skeletal muscle development. Genes participating in the ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway were found to be deregulated in LGMD2A patients, suggesting that regulation of this pathway may be under the control of calpain 3 activity. As frizzled-related protein (FRZB) is upregulated in LGMD2A muscle samples, it could be hypothesized that beta-catenin regulation is also altered at the Wnt signaling pathway, leading to an incorrect myogenesis. Conversely, expression of most transcription factor genes was downregulated (MYC, FOS and EGR1). Finally, the upregulation of IL-32 and immunoglobulin genes may induce the eosinophil chemoattraction explaining the inflammatory findings observed in presymptomatic stages. The obtained results try to shed some light on identification of novel therapeutic targets for limb-girdle muscular dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W1974401909,"Heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is a member of a vertebrate transcription factor family for genes of heat shock proteins and is involved in the regulation of development and cellular differentiation. The DNA binding property of HSF2 is modulated by the post-translational modification of a specific lysine residue in its DNA binding domain by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), but the consequences of SUMOylation and its underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. Here we show the inhibitory effect of SUMOylation on the interaction between HSF2 and DNA based on biochemical analysis using isolated recombinant HSF2. NMR study of the SUMOylated DNA binding domain of HSF2 indicates that the SUMO moiety is flexible with respect to the DNA binding domain and has neither a noncovalent interface with nor a structural effect on the domain. Combined with data from double electron-electron resonance and paramagnetic NMR relaxation enhancement experiments, these results suggest that SUMO attachment negatively modulates the formation of the protein-DNA complex through a randomly distributed steric interference.

The heat shock response is a cellular defense against environmental and physiological stresses, such as heat, heavy metals, oxygen radicals, and viral or bacterial infections. Eukaryotic cells maintain homeostasis through elevating the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), 4The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; DBD, DNA binding domain; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; HSF, heat shock factor; HSE, heat shock element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; hHSF2FL, full-length human HSF2β; TDG, thymine DNA glycosylase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MTSL, (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d3-pyrroline-3-methyl) methane thiosulfonate; SDSL, site-directed spin labeling; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; SIM, SUMO interaction motif; HR, hydrophobic repeat; DEER, double electron-electron resonance; PRE, paramagnetic NMR relaxation enhancement; HtH, head-to-head; TtT, tail-to-tail. which function as molecular chaperones, in response to various stress stimuli. The heat shock response is also evoked during nonstress-induced processes, such as early development and cellular differentiation in mammals (1Akerfelt M. Trouillet D. Mezger V. Sistonen L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.. 2007; 1113: 15-27Google Scholar). The HSP genes are up-regulated by heat shock elements (HSEs) comprising multiple, and at least three, inverted repeats of the pentanucleotide 5′-nGAAn-3′, where n denotes any nucleotide. The proteins within the heat shock factor (HSF) family, evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human, bind to HSEs and regulate the transcription level of a set of the HSP genes. One of the mammalian members, HSF2, is involved in development and differentiation-related processes, whereas HSF1 is responsive to classical stress stimuli (2Loones M.T. Rallu M. Mezger V. Morange M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci.. 1997; 53: 179-190Google Scholar, 3Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Google Scholar). Recent genetic and biological studies have revealed that interplays between HSF1 and HSF2 gain functional versatility in the stress response and developmental signaling pathways. For example, HSF1 and HSF2 form heterocomplexes on the promoters of chaperone genes, clusterin and hsp70, and are cooperatively involved in the regulation of these genes (4Loison F. Debure L. Nizard P. le Goff P. Michel D. le Drean Y. Biochem. J.. 2006; 395: 223-231Google Scholar, 5Ostling P. Bjork J.K. Roos-Mattjus P. Mezger V. Sistonen L. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 7077-7086Google Scholar). The HSF members are characterized by a conserved domain structure that consists of a winged helix-turn-helix motif near the N terminus followed by an extended hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR-A/B). By itself, the helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain (DBD) of HSFs is capable of binding to at least two inverted HSEs, regardless of the repeat directions, that is head-to-head (nGAAnnTTCn) and tail-to-tail (nTTCnnGAAn) repeats (6Perisic O. Xiao H. Lis J.T. Cell.. 1989; 59: 797-806Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that Drosophila and yeast HSFs preferentially bind to the tail-to-tail elements rather than the head-to-head ones (7Bonner J.J. Ballou C. Fackenthal D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1994; 14: 501-508Google Scholar, 8Xiao H. Perisic O. Lis J.T. Cell.. 1991; 64: 585-593Google Scholar). The HR-A/B domain facilitates trimerization through the formation of a coiled-coil bundle upon receiving stress signals. The trimer formation enables HSFs to bind the HSE repeats with high affinity, and hence transcription of the downstream HSP genes is activated. Nevertheless, the isolated DBDs of Kluyveromyces lactis have been shown to bind to HSEs in vitro (9Littlefield O. Nelson H.C. Nat. Struct. Biol.. 1999; 6: 464-470Google Scholar); thus it is suggested that isolated DBDs of HSFs retain a binding affinity for HSE repeats and that the trimer formation of HSF1 and HSF2 has a regulative role in DNA binding. In addition to these functional domains, HSF1 and HSF2 possess a C-terminal hydrophobic repeat (HR-C) that suppresses the trimer formation to maintain an inactive state in the absence of stimuli (10Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science.. 1993; 259: 230-234Google Scholar). Functional properties of mammalian HSFs were found to be modulated by post-translational modification with small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). Modification with SUMO (SUMOylation) has been recognized as an important regulatory mechanism in diverse cellular processes such as nuclear trafficking, transcription, and DNA repair (11Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev.. 2003; 4: 690-699Google Scholar). SUMO shares structural similarity with ubiquitin and can be covalently attached to lysine residues within a ψKXE consensus sequence (ψ indicates hydrophobic residue and X is any amino acid) in target proteins via an isopeptide bond formed through an enzymatic pathway that is similar to but distinct from that in ubiquitination (11Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev.. 2003; 4: 690-699Google Scholar, 12Gill G. Genes Dev.. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Google Scholar, 13Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Google Scholar). Several SUMO paralogues, termed SUMO-1, SUMO-2/3, and SUMO-4, have been identified in mammals to date (14Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Google Scholar). The majority of SUMOylation substrates identified thus far are nuclear factors, including transcriptional regulators (11Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev.. 2003; 4: 690-699Google Scholar, 15Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev.. 2005; 15: 536-541Google Scholar). With some transcription factors, the conjugation of SUMO introduces a new protein-protein interaction surface without changing the DNA binding properties, leading to the recruitment of distinct multiprotein complexes required for transcriptional activation or repression (16Chang C.C. Lin D.Y. Fang H.I. Chen R.H. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 10164-10173Google Scholar, 17Lin D.Y. Fang H.I. Ma A.H. Huang Y.S. Pu Y.S. Jenster G. Kung H.J. Shih H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 10529-10541Google Scholar). In some other cases, SUMOylation regulates gene expression levels by altering the subnuclear localization of transcriptional regulators (18Dobreva G. Dambacher J. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev.. 2003; 17: 3048-3061Google Scholar, 19Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev.. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Google Scholar). The molecular basis underlying the regulation of protein-DNA interactions by SUMO remains to be elucidated, but one clear example has been provided by biochemical and structural studies on a DNA repair enzyme, thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) (20Baba D. Maita N. Jee J.G. Uchimura Y. Saitoh H. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Tochio H. Hiroaki H. Shirakawa M. Nature.. 2005; 435: 979-982Google Scholar, 21Hardeland U. Steinacher R. Jiricny J. Schar P. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 1456-1464Google Scholar). The modification with SUMO-1 is suggested to induce a conformational change in TDG that is associated with noncovalent contacts between the covalently linked SUMO-1 and TDG moieties, and ultimately it leads to a loss of DNA binding. The HSF isoforms exhibit different SUMOylation patterns that might provide complex physiological effects, whereas Lys-298 in HSF1 is modified by either SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 (22Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis M.J. Mayhew C.N. Goodson M.L. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 40263-40267Google Scholar), Lys-82 and Lys-139 in HSF2 are modified by SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3, respectively (23Anckar J. Hietakangas V. Denessiouk K. Thiele D.J. Johnson M.S. Sistonen L. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2006; 26: 955-964Google Scholar, 24Goodson M.L. Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis M.J. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Google Scholar). Of these sites in HSF2, Lys-82, which is located in a loop region (“wing”) of the DBD, is the primary SUMOylation site. Lys-139 in the trimerization domain has been observed to be much less efficiently sumoylated than Lys-82 (23Anckar J. Hietakangas V. Denessiouk K. Thiele D.J. Johnson M.S. Sistonen L. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2006; 26: 955-964Google Scholar). The importance of SUMOylation at Lys-82 of HSF2 has been emphasized by its involvement in bookmarking of the hsp70i gene in mitosis (25Xing H. Wilkerson D.C. Mayhew C.N. Lubert E.J. Skaggs H.S. Goodson M.L. Hong Y. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. Science.. 2005; 307: 421-423Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of the SUMOylation are still unclear because the SUMO modification of HSF2 at Lys-82 has been reported to both enhance and inhibit its DNA binding (23Anckar J. Hietakangas V. Denessiouk K. Thiele D.J. Johnson M.S. Sistonen L. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2006; 26: 955-964Google Scholar, 24Goodson M.L. Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis M.J. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Google Scholar, 26Hilgarth R.S. Murphy L.A. O'Connor C.M. Clark J.A. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. Cell Stress Chaperones.. 2004; 9: 214-220Google Scholar). To clarify the effect of SUMOylation on the DNA interaction activity of HSF2, we examined the biochemical properties of isolated recombinant human HSF2 conjugated with SUMO-1. Furthermore, to understand the detailed molecular mechanism by which SUMO-1 conjugation alters the DNA binding mode of HSF2, we performed structural analysis on the SUMO-1-conjugated HSF2 DBD using NMR and ESR spectroscopic techniques. Our biochemical and structural data indicate that SUMOylation of HSF2 interferes with the binding to HSEs through a molecular mechanism distinct from that proposed by structural studies of the SUMOylated TDG. The covalent attachment of SUMO does not cause any notable conformational change in the HSF2 DBD or form a stable noncovalent interaction with HSF2. Here we propose a novel model in which the randomly distributed SUMO moiety tethered to the flexible loop in HSF2 DBD restricts accessibility of HSF2 to DNA through a steric interference in a probabilistic manner, resulting in less chance for the formation of the encounter complex. Protein Expression and Purification—The cDNA region encoding DBD of human HSF2β (hHSF2DBD) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T-3 (GE Healthcare) with an N-terminal GST tag. The hHSF2DBD expression vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5 at 660 nm, and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 30 °C. For preparation of 15N-SUMO-1 and 15N-hHSF2DBD, M9 minimal media containing 0.5 g/liter 15NH4Cl was used instead of LB media. Cells were lysed by sonication in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm EDTA. The clarified lysate was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) after the debris was removed by centrifugation. hHSF2DBD was eluted from the beads by cleaving off the GST tag with 60 units/g thrombin protease (GE Healthcare) for 3 h at room temperature. The eluted protein was further purified using ion-exchange and affinity column chromatography with HiTrap SP HP and Hitrap heparin HP columns (GE Healthcare), respectively. hHSF2DBD was purified with more than 95% homogeneity. A K139R point mutation was introduced into full-length human HSF2β (hHSF2FL) by PCR using two complementary primers containing mismatched nucleotides at the codon corresponding to Lys-139. The PCR mixture was treated with DpnI to remove the template plasmid, followed by direct transformation into E. coli DH5α cells. hHSF2FLK139R was expressed as a GST fusion protein in BL21(DE3)-Codon Plus-RIL cells (Novagen) and was purified by GST affinity column chromatography. The GST tag was cleaved off with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) on the glutathione beads, resulting in elution of hHSF2FLK139R from the beads. Further purification was carried out using cation-exchange column chromatography with a Hitrap heparin HP column (GE Healthcare) and size-exclusion column chromatography with a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200-pg column (GE Healthcare). Preparation of SUMOylated Protein—For preparation of SUMOylated hHSF2DBD, a pGEX4T-3 vector encoding hHSF2DBD and a pTS1 vector encoding SUMO-1 and SUMOylation enzymes, Aos1/Uba2 and Ubc9, were co-transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (27Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Sugasawa K. Nakao M. Saitoh H. Anal. Biochem.. 2004; 331: 204-206Google Scholar). The transformed cells were cultivated in LB medium at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5 at 660 nm, and then were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C for 18 h. About 60% of the expressed hHSF2DBD was SUMOylated. SUMO-hHSF2-DBD was purified in the same manner as the SUMO-free DBD. Unmodified hHSF2DBD was completely removed during the purification process. 15N-SUMO-1-conjugated nonlabeled hHSF2DBD, nonlabeled SUMO-1-conjugated 15N-hHSF2DBD, and SUMOylated hHSF2FLK139R were prepared using an in vitro SUMOylation method. 15 μm SUMO-1 and 7.5 μm GST-hHSF2 were mixed in 30-50 ml of a reaction mixture containing partially purified His-Aos1/Uba2, 3 μm His-Ubc9, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 5 mm ATP. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 4 h. These SUMOylated proteins were purified in the same manner as described above. DNA Interaction Assay (EMSA)—Synthesized oligonucleotides were used in EMSA experiments as follows: HtH16, 5′-GGTAGAATATTCTTGG-3′; TtT16, 5′-GGTATTCTAGAATTGG-3′; HtH26, 5′-GTTATGGTAGAATATTCTTGGTATTG-3′; and TtT26, 5′-GTTATGGTATTCTAGAATTGGTATTG-3′. Each duplex oligonucleotide was mixed with the unmodified or SUMOylated protein in a binding reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then was subjected to electrophoresis on 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.5× TBE buffer at 200 V, 10 mA for 30 min at 4 °C. The bands containing DNA were visualized by staining with Gelred™ (Biotinum) and UV illumination. SPR Measurement—Dissociation constants of hHSF2 for HSE oligonucleotides were measured by SPR using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (GE Healthcare). 5′-Biotinylated HtH and TtT HSE oligonucleotides were each immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip SA, 200 response units for experiments with hHSF2DBD, and 100 response units for those with hHSF2FLK139R. Analytes were diluted with the binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA and 0.005% Tween 20, and were injected/applied at a flow rate of 20 μl/min (hHSF2DBD) or 30 μl/min (hHSF2FLK139R). The sensor chip immobilizing the oligonucleotides was regenerated between runs by flowing 50 mm NaOH, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.001% SDS over the chip surface. SPR sensorgrams were processed and analyzed using the BIA-evaluation 3.0 software package (GE Healthcare) and assuming the binding occurred at a protein:DNA molar ratio of 2:1. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra of hHSF2DBD and SUMOylated hHSF2DBD were acquired with an Avance 700 spectrometer equipped with a CryoProbe (Bruker Biospin) at 298 K in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), containing 200 mm KCl, 5% D2O. Sequential backbone assignments for hHSF2DBD were carried out by HNCA, HNCACB, CBCA-(CO)NH, HN(CO)CA, and HN(CO)CACB experiments using a 15N-13C uniformly labeled sample. NMR data were analyzed using NMRPipe (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR.. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar) and SPARKY 3.1 (29Goddard T.G. Kneller D.G. Sparky3. University of California, San Francisco2002Google Scholar). Backbone assignments were evaluated using a reverse isotopic labeling technique; the signals derived from Arg and Lys residues were confirmed by adding natural abundant l-Arg or l-Lys at 100 mg/liter in M9 minimal media (30Vuister G.W. Kim S.J. Wu C. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 1994; 116: 9206-9210Google Scholar). MTSL Labeling—Cysteine mutants of SUMO-1, C52A/S50C, C52A/Q53C, C52A/V87C, and C52A/E89C were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as described above, and were expressed and purified as reported previously (27Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Sugasawa K. Nakao M. Saitoh H. Anal. Biochem.. 2004; 331: 204-206Google Scholar). E19C and K51C mutants of hHSF2DBD were also generated by site-directed mutagenesis and prepared as described above. For DEER measurements, both hHSF2DBDE19C and hHSF2DBDK51C were SUMOylated in vitro with SUMO-1C52A/Q53C and purified as mentioned above. For PRE measurements, 15N-hHSF2DBD was conjugated with each SUMO-1 cysteine mutant using the in vitro SUMOylation system, and was subsequently purified using anion-exchange chromatography. MTSL, dissolved in DMSO, was added to each SUMOylated hHSF2DBD mutant in a 4 m excess of cysteine residues, and then the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 12 h. The MTSL-labeled protein was further purified by affinity chromatography using a Heparin-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare). DEER Spectra Measurement—DEER spectra were measured on 150 μl of each MTSL-labeled protein (100 μm), which were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, as described previously (31Hara H. Tenno T. Shirakawa M. J. Magn. Reson.. 2007; 184: 78-84Google Scholar, 32Pannier M. Veit S. Godt A. Jeschke G. Spiess H.W. J. Magn. Reson.. 2000; 142: 331-340Google Scholar). Pulsed DEER data were acquired at 80 K on an ELEXSYS E580 X-band FT/CW spectrometer (Bruker Biospin) equipped with a dielectric resonator (ER4118X-MD5-W1) and helium gas flow system (CF935, Oxford Instruments). The obtained DEER spectra were analyzed by using the DEER Fit and DEER Trafo programs (available on line). For DEER measurement, a 4-pulse constant time DEER sequence was employed (31Hara H. Tenno T. Shirakawa M. J. Magn. Reson.. 2007; 184: 78-84Google Scholar, 32Pannier M. Veit S. Godt A. Jeschke G. Spiess H.W. J. Magn. Reson.. 2000; 142: 331-340Google Scholar). The pump pulse was set to the maximum of the nitroxide ESR spectrum (ωB = 9.58 GHz). The observer pulse was set to 60 MHz higher (ωA = 9.64 GHz), which corresponds to about a 20-G field separation. The π/2 pulse width was 16 ns. The π pulses and the pump pulse were 32 ns. Comparative Modeling—The amino acid sequences of human and Drosophila HSF DBD were aligned using FUGUE (33Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol.. 2001; 310: 243-257Google Scholar). A series of models of hHSF2DBD was generated with MODELLER (34Eswar N. Eramian D. Webb B. Shen M.Y. Sali A. Methods Mol. Biol.. 2008; 426: 145-159Google Scholar) using each of the 28 NMR-derived models of Drosophila HSF DBD (35Vuister G.W. Kim S.J. Orosz A. Marquardt J. Wu C. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol.. 1994; 1: 605-614Google Scholar) deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry 1HKT) as a template. Ten of these hHSF2DBD models were superimposed onto one of the subunits in the crystal structure of the K. lactis HSF DBD dimer bound to the TtT repeat (chain B of PDB entry 3HTS) using the programs SSM (36Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr.. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Google Scholar) and MOLMOL (37Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics.. 1996; 14: 29-32Google Scholar). The superimposed structures were displayed using PyMOL (38DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. De Lano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Calculation of Structural Model—The modeled structure of the SUMO-1-conjugated hHSF2DBD was calculated with HADDOCK 2.0 (39Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Google Scholar). An ensemble of the 10 structures of the hHSF2DBD comparative models and 1 SUMO-1 structure taken from an NMR ensemble (PDB entry 1A5R) were used as the starting structures. The C-terminal region of SUMO-1 (residues 94-97) and the flexible loop of hHSF2DBD (residues 75-87) were defined as “fully flexible.” Two distance constraints derived from the most populated distances obtained by DEER experiments were used in the calculation: 36-46 and 35-45 Å for the distances between Gln-53 C-α of SUMO-1 and Glu-19 C-α of hHSF2DBD, and between Gln-53 C-α of SUMO-1 and Lys-51 C-α of hHSF2DBD, respectively. Lower limits were set based on the fact that difference in distances between two C-α atoms (Rαα) of spin-labeled cysteines and between the two nitroxide moieties (RNONO) of a doubly MTSL-labeled protein has been shown to range from 0 to 10 Å (40Borbat P.P. McHaourab H.S. Freed J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2002; 124: 5304-5314Google Scholar). To mimic the isopeptide bond between hHSF2DBD and SUMO, a 2.0 Å distance constraint was introduced between the carboxyl carbon of Gly-97 of SUMO-1 and the N-ζ nitrogen of Lys-82 of the hHSFDBD with a force constant of 500 kcal mol-1 Å-2. A total of 1000 structures was initially generated. The top 200 structures were subjected to simulated annealing calculations, and the 20 with the lowest intermolecular energy were analyzed and presented. SUMO-1 Modification Abrogates the DNA Binding Activity of hHSF2 DBD—Combined with biochemical data, the crystal structure of the K. lactis HSF DBD in complex with DNA previously demonstrated a stable dimer formation of its DBD upon binding to two inverted HSEs arranged in the tail-to-tail orientation (9Littlefield O. Nelson H.C. Nat. Struct. Biol.. 1999; 6: 464-470Google Scholar). Each of the HSE repeats is recognized by an individual DBD of K. lactis HSF, and the specific protein-DNA interaction is stabilized by the intersubunit contacts of the protein dimer. In agreement with this previous observation, our results from the EMSA indicate that the isolated DBD of human HSF2, including amino acid residues 6-110 (hereafter designated as hHSF2DBD), binds to two or three inverted HSE consensus repeats (Fig. 1, A and B) but not to a single one (data not shown). An analysis using size-exclusion column chromatography showed that hHSF2DBD exists as a monomer without DNA in solution (data not shown), supporting the dimerization of DBD upon specific binding to the repeated HSEs. To examine whether hHSF2DBD exhibits a preference for the direction of the HSE repeats, we performed EMSA using a 26-bp-long oligonucleotide containing two inverted repeats in either the HtH or TtT direction (Fig. 1A). The HSF2DBD-HtH26 and the HSF2DBD-TtT26 complexes each showed a clear band shift (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 5). The affinity of hHSF2DBD for each HSE oligonucleotide was quantified using SPR. Assuming the binding of protein:DNA in a 2:1 molar ratio, the dissociation constants (Kd) for the HtH26 and TtT26 repeats were estimated to be 9.25 ± 0.54 and 20.96 ± 2.12 μm, respectively (Fig. 1C and Table 1). Thus hHSF2DBD binds to two inverted HSE arrays without strong preference for either the HtH or TtT arrangement. Next, EMSA was performed with recombinant SUMOylated hHSF2DBD to examine the influence of SUMO-1 conjugation at Lys-82 on the DNA binding activity. SUMO-1-conjugated hHSF2DBD (SUMO-hHSF2DBD) was produced in E. coli using a binary vector system in which SUMO-1 and an acceptor protein are simultaneously expressed together with SUMOylation enzymes, SUMO-E1 and SUMO-E2 (27Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Sugasawa K. Nakao M. Saitoh H. Anal. Biochem.. 2004; 331: 204-206Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1A). In the EMSA using the oligonucleotides described above, interaction of SUMO-hHSF2DBD with neither HtH26 nor TtT26 repeats was detected (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 6). An accurate dissociation constant of SUMO-HSF2DBD for both the HtH26 and TtT26 DNA could not be determined by SPR measurements, because the SPR responses were weak and did not reach a state of equilibrium. In addition, SUMO-hHSF2DBD was not able to bind to a longer DNA probe containing three-inverted HSE arrays (data not shown). These data demonstrate that SUMO-1 conjugation inhibits the DNA binding activity of hHSF2DBD regardless of the direction of the HSE repeats. These DNA binding assays were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm KCl. The same effect of SUMOylation on the DNA binding affinity of hHSF2DBD was also observed in EMSA performed in the presence of 200 mm KCl (supplemental Fig. 1C).TABLE 1Dissociation constants between HSE DNA and hHSF2 or SUMOylated hHSF2 as determined by SPR measurementshHSF2DBD-(6-110)SUMO1-hHSF2DBDHtH 26 mer9.25 ± 0.54 μmNDaAn accurate dissociation constant could not be determined, due to small SPR responses.TtT 26 mer20.96 ± 2.12 μmNDaAn accurate dissociation constant could not be determined, due to small SPR responses.HtH 16 mer14.37 ± 0.26 μm112.89 ± 2.99 μmTtT 16 mer60.91 ± 8.22 μmNDaAn accurate dissociation constant could not be determined, due to small SPR responses.hHSF2FLK139RSUMO1-hHSF2FLK139RHtH 26 mer12.15 ± 0.27 nm192.53 ± 2.89 nmTtT 26 mer19.67 ± 0.74 nm355.98 ± 17.01 nmHtH 16 mer29.99 ± 2.36 nm357.55 ± 47.91 nmTtT 16 mer124.34 ± 7.55 nm3.16 ± 0.17 μma An accurate dissociation constant could not be determined, due to small SPR responses. Open table in a new tab SUMO Modification Decreases the DNA Binding Activity of Full-length hHSF2—The effect of SUMO modification on the DNA binding activity of hHSF2FL was also investigated using EMSA and SPR measurements with recombinant SUMOylated hHSF2FL (SUMO-hHSF2FL). The SUMO-hHSF2FL sample was prepared by an in vitro SUMOylation reaction (supplemental Fig. 1B). To assess the consequence of the SUMO conjugation to Lys-82 solely, another possible SUMOylation site, Lys-139, lying in the HR-A/B domain, was mutated to arginine. In the EMSA experiment shown in Fig. 1D, band shifts of the complex with unmodified hHSF2FLK139R were observed for both HtH26 and TtT26 oligonucleotides (lanes 2 and 6). On the other hand, SUMO-hHSF2FLK139R bound less efficiently to the HSE repeats than unmodified hHSF2FLK139R, but full DNA binding activity was recovered by releasing the SUMO moiety with SUMO-specific protease (SENP) treatment (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4 and 7 and 8). Based on SPR measurements, the Kd values of hHSF2FLK139R for HtH26 and TtT26 repeats were estimated to be 12.15 ± 0.27 and 19.67 ± 0.74 nm, respectively, whereas the Kd values of SUMO-hSHF2FLK139R were estimated to be 192.53 ± 2.89 nm for HtH26 and 355.98 ± 17.01 nm for TtT26 (Fig. 1E and Table 1). The modification with SUMO-1 was also shown to decrease the affinity of hHSF2FL for five repeated HSEs existing in the natural hsp70 proximal promoter region by an EMSA experiment (data not shown). Taken together, these observations indicate that hHSF2FL binds to the two inverted HSEs in both the HtH and TtT directions with similar affinities, and that its DNA binding affinity is reduced by more than 10-fold by SUMOylation at Lys-82, regardless of the HSE repeat direction. hHSFDBD Does Not Form a Noncovalent Interface with the Covalently Attached SUMO-1—We next addressed whether there were stable noncovalent interactions between SUMO-1 and hHSF2DBD when they are covalently linked through an isopeptide bond. The molecular interaction and conformational changes induced by the covalent attachment were analyzed using two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation spectra. SUMO-hHSF2DBD was prepared by an in vitro SUMOylation reaction, in which either the SUMO-1 or the hHSFDBD moiety was uniformly labeled with 15N to selectively observe NMR signals from the labeled moiety. Chemical shift perturbation experiments were carried out in a buffer containing 200 mm KCl. The two-dimensional 1H-15N correlati"

Pex19p is the import receptor for type I PMPs, whereas targeting of type II PMPs, of which Pex3p so far represents the only species, does not require Pex19p. Pex3p possesses two domains with distinct function: a short N-terminal domain, which harbors the information for peroxisomal (and ER) targeting, and a C-terminal domain, which faces the cytosol and serves as a docking site for Pex19p, thereby delivering newly synthesized PMPs to the peroxisome. Here we show that the N-terminal domain of Pex3p can be functionally replaced by the N-terminal peroxisomal membrane targeting signal (mPTS) of Pex22p, a supposedly unrelated component of the import machinery for peroxisomal matrix proteins. An exchange of the mPTS of Pex22p by that of Pex3p likewise fully preserved the function of Pex22p. Neither of the two mPTS interacted with Pex19p, and in the absence of Pex19p, colocalization of Pex3p and Pex22p was observed, indicating that also Pex22p is targeted to peroxisomes by a type II mPTS. When a type I mPTS was hooked to the C-terminal domains of Pex22p and Pex3p, function was retained in the case of Pex22p and in part even for Pex3p. The C-terminal domain of Pex3p thus contains the relevant information required for de novo peroxisome formation, thereby challenging the concept of the N terminus of Pex3p being key in that process.

The C-terminal domain of Pex3p thus contains the relevant information required for de novo peroxisome formation, thereby challenging the concept of the N terminus of Pex3p being key in that process. Peroxisome biogenesis requires a set of proteins called peroxins, most of which accomplish the faithful import of matrix proteins (1Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Biochem.. 2000; 69: 399-418Google Scholar). Two types of targeting signals are known to direct proteins to the peroxisomal lumen: a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) 2The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; mPTS, peroxisomal membrane targeting signal; PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TMD, transmembrane domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; mPTS, peroxisomal membrane targeting signal; PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TMD, transmembrane domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. comprising the C-terminal tripeptide SKL and conservative variants thereof, and an N-terminal PTS2. The import of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) follows a distinct route and depends on Pex3p and Pex19p in all of the species analyzed (4Fujiki Y. Matsuzono Y. Matsuzaki T. Fransen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2006; 1763: 1639-1646Google Scholar) and on Pex16p in mammals (5South S.T. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol.. 1999; 144: 255-266Google Scholar, 6Honsho M. Hiroshige T. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 44513-44524Google Scholar). The majority of PMPs are recognized by Pex19p during or early after synthesis in the cytosol. Pex19p binding not only protects these hydrophobic proteins from aggregation but also delivers them to the peroxisomal membrane (7Matsuzono Y. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 36-42Google Scholar, 8Pinto M.P. Grou C.P. Alencastre I.S. Oliveira M.E. Sa-Miranda C. Fransen M. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 34492-34502Google Scholar, 9Pause B.

Docking of the cargo-loaded Pex19p receptor at the peroxisomal membrane occurs via the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Pex3p (10Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol.. 2004; 164: 57-67Google Scholar, 11Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol.

Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol.. 2004; 164: 863-875Google Scholar). In a subsequent, poorly understood step, PMPs are released from Pex19p for insertion into the peroxisomal membrane. Although some controversy exists in the literature on the nature of a peroxisomal membrane protein targeting signal (mPTS), it requires one or more transmembrane spans and a targeting-specific sequence that is identical to the Pex19p-binding site in at least a subset of PMPs (4Fujiki Y. Matsuzono Y. Matsuzaki T. Fransen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2006; 1763: 1639-1646Google Scholar, 10Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J.

In mutants with a specific block in matrix protein import, PMPs are normally imported into so-called peroxisomal remnants. In contrast, in the absence of the peroxins required for PMP import, i.e. Pex3p, Pex16p, or Pex19p, peroxisomes are thought to be truly missing (14Hettema E.H. Girzalsky W. van Den Berg M. Erdmann R. Distel B. EMBO J.. 2000; 19: 223-233Google Scholar). Nonetheless, upon reintroduction of the respective missing gene, peroxisome formation can be restored in these strains (5South S.T. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol.. 1999; 144: 255-266Google Scholar, 15South S.T. Sacksteder K.A. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol.. 2000; 149: 1345-1360Google Scholar, 16Ghaedi K. Tamura S. Okumoto K. Matsuzono Y. Fujiki Y. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2000; 11: 2085-2102Google Scholar). Recent work highlights the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a cornerstone in this process (17Hoepfner D. Schildknegt D. Braakman I. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Cell.. 2005; 122: 85-95Google Scholar, 18Motley A.M. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol.. 2007; 178: 399-410Google Scholar, 19Kim P.K. Mullen R.T. Schumann U. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol.. 2006; 173: 521-532Google Scholar), but other scenarios such as the existence of a protoperoxisome still appear conceivable (20Lazarow P.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol.. 2003; 15: 489-497Google Scholar, 21South S.T. Baumgart E. Gould S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 12027-12031Google Scholar). Consent exists on Pex3p being essential for PMP import, and it is widely considered as an early peroxin that is able to trigger de novo peroxisome formation by virtue of its N-terminal mPTS, which comprises ∼45 amino acids (22Tam Y.Y. Fagarasanu A. Fagarasanu M. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 34933-34939Google Scholar, 23Faber K.N. Haan G.J. Baerends R.J. Kram A.M. Veenhuis M. J. Biol.

In mammals targeting of Pex3p turned out to be Pex19p-independent, whereas all other PMPs tested did require Pex19p (10Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol.. 2004; 164: 57-67Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pex3p was reported to reside in the ER in the absence of Pex19p, poised to form mature peroxisomes upon reintroduction of Pex19p (17Hoepfner D. Schildknegt D. Braakman I. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Cell.. 2005; 122: 85-95Google Scholar). That Pex3p sorts to peroxisomes via the ER also in wild-type cells is supported by a transient localization of conditionally expressed Pex3p to the ER (17Hoepfner D. Schildknegt D. Braakman I. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Cell.. 2005; 122: 85-95Google Scholar), as well as by a set of experiments using a Pex3p variant with an appended ER-targeting signal (25Kragt A. Voorn-Brouwer T. van den Berg M. Distel B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 34350-34357Google Scholar). Vesicular transport of Pex3p to peroxisomes would also explain how peroxisomes are supplied with membrane lipids (18Motley A.M. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol.. 2007; 178: 399-410Google Scholar, 26Tabak H.F. Hoepfner D. Zand A. Geuze H.J. Braakman I. Huynen M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2006; 1763: 1647-1654Google Scholar). Notably, however, none of these experimental setups monitored endogenous Pex3p, and as a consequence, a direct insertion of Pex3p from the cytosol in the presence of peroxisomes cannot be totally ruled out. Evidence for a direct targeting was indeed reported for the Arabidopsis thaliana (27Hunt J.E. Trelease R.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2004; 314: 586-596Google Scholar) and human (10Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol.. 2004; 164: 57-67Google Scholar) orthologs of Pex3p. Pex3p possesses two domains with distinct function: the short N-terminal domain harbors the mPTS including a short luminal domain and one transmembrane domain (TMD) and is also thought to create the basis for the formation of peroxisomes, and the C-terminal domain faces the cytosol and serves as a docking site for Pex19p, thereby delivering newly synthesized PMPs to the peroxisome (4Fujiki Y. Matsuzono Y. Matsuzaki T. Fransen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2006; 1763: 1639-1646Google Scholar). Pex22p is involved in a late step of matrix protein import and does not play a role in the biogenesis of the peroxisomal membrane (28Koller A. Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol.. 1999; 146: 99-112Google Scholar). Although functionally distinct, the topology of Pex22p resembles that of Pex3p, with a single TMD, a short N-terminal region facing the peroxisomal lumen, and a large C-terminal domain exposed to the cytosol. This latter domain provides the docking site for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Pex4p (28Koller A. Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol.. 1999; 146: 99-112Google Scholar), which accomplishes the export of the PTS1 receptor Pex5p via ubiquitination of a conserved cysteine residue (29Platta H.W. El Magraoui F. Schlee D. Grunau S. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. J. Cell Biol.. 2007; 177: 197-204Google Scholar, 30Williams C. van den Berg M. Sprenger R.R. Distel B. J. Biol.

In Pichia pastoris, targeting of Pex22p depended on its N terminus (28Koller A. Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol.. 1999; 146: 99-112Google Scholar), but it is currently unknown whether Pex19p is directly involved in the recruiting of Pex22p to the peroxisomal membrane. In this study we compared the targeting of Pex3p with that of Pex22p and examined the role of Pex19p in this process. The mPTS sequences were mutually exchanged and analyzed for their ability to restore function in pex22Δ and pex3Δ mutants. The gathered data not only led to the identification of a second, functionally unrelated PMP that is targeted to peroxisomes via a Pex19p-independent type II mPTS but also challenge the concept of the N terminus of Pex3p being key in peroxisome formation. Strains and Media—Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) was used for all of the plasmid amplifications and preparations according to standard protocols (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Promega, Madison, WI) was employed for heterologous expression of GST-ScPEX19 (GE Healthcare). The S. cerevisiae wild-type strain UTL-7A (MATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1) was used throughout the study (33Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Google Scholar) except for two-hybrid analysis where yeast strain PJ69-4A (34James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics.. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar) was employed. The deletion strains UTL-7A pex3Δ, UTL-7A pex22Δ, and UTL-7A pex3Δpex19Δ were created by the “short flanking homology” method using the removable loxP-kanMX-loxP cassette (35Güldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res.. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Google Scholar). Strain yHPR251 harbors a genomically integrated construct designed to express a PTS2-DsRed fusion protein (36Stein K. Schell-Steven A. Erdmann R. Rottensteiner H. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2002; 22: 6056-6069Google Scholar). Standard media for cultivation of bacterial and yeast strains were prepared as described previously (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 33Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Peroxisome induction was achieved with Rytka medium (0.1% (w/v) oleic acid, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 40, 0.1% glucose, 0,17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, amino acids as required, adjusted to pH 6). Oleic acid plates contained 0.1% (w/v) oleic acid, 0.5% (w/v) Tween 80, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, amino acids as required, 0.5% potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6, and 2.4% agar. Plasmids—The plasmids and oligonucleotides used are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, genes and gene fragments were amplified from genomic DNA of the S. cerevisiae wild-type strain UTL-7A. The respective PCR primers, restriction sites, and target vectors used for cloning are also listed in supplemental Table S1. The sequence of all PCR-generated fragments was verified by automated sequencing (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). To clone pMDE24/2, DsRed.T1 was amplified from pMDE21 (37Deckers M. Charakterisierung peroxisomaler Proteine aus Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D. Thesis, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum2007Google Scholar) by using PCR primers RE1685/1686 and inserted into pMDE23 (38Kuravi K. Nagotu S. Krikken A.M. Sjollema K. Deckers M. Erdmann R.

Following SacI/KpnI digestion of pMDE24/1, the entire MET25Prom-DsRed.T1-Ant1-CYC1Term cassette was transferred into appropriately digested pRS414. Plasmid pAH78 was created by replacing ANT1 with CYB5; pHPR346 was digested with SpeI/XhoI and the isolated CYB5 was transferred to the similarly treated pMD24/2. To construct pAH54, the isolated MET25 promoter was transferred from pUG35 to pRS414 after SacI/SpeI digestion of both plasmids. The CYC1 terminator was lifted from pUG36 by XhoI/KpnI digestion and inserted into the similarly treated pAH54 resulting in pAH76. DsRed.T1 was amplified from pUG34DsRed.T1-SKL (38Kuravi K. Nagotu S. Krikken A.M. Sjollema K. Deckers M. Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. J.

PCR amplification of PEX22 by virtue of primer pair RE1708/1709 and subsequent insertion into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pAH77 finally led to pAH73. Fluorescence and Electron Microscopy—Live cell imaging was carried out essentially as described (11Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol.

The cells were analyzed for GFP and DsRed by virtue of a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a Zeiss α Plan-FLUAR 100×/1.45 oil objective. The micrographs were recorded with an Axiocam MR digital camera and processed with Axio Vison 4.2 software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Electron microscopy was carried out as described (33Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Google Scholar, 39Rottensteiner H. Stein K. Sonnenhol E. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2003; 14: 4316-4328Google Scholar). To induce peroxisome proliferation, the cells were incubated in oleic acid-containing medium over night. The cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde, stained with 1.5% KMnO4 and 1% uranyl acetate, and inspected with a Philips EM 300 transmission electron microscope (Philips Electron Optics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Subcellular Fractionation by Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—A post-nuclear supernatant (total protein content, 10 mg) prepared from cells that had been induced overnight in Rytka medium was loaded on top of a linear sucrose gradient (20-54% w/w) and subjected to centrifugation at 38,000 × g in a vertical rotor (SV-288, Sorvall RCB5; DuPont, Bad Nauheim, Germany) for 90 min. Subsequently, the gradients were fractionated from the bottom to the top, and the resulting fractions were analyzed for catalase activity (EC 1.11.1.6) using an established method (40Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.-H. Harder W. Yeast.. 1987; 3: 77-84Google Scholar). In addition, aliquots of each fraction were precipitated, resolved in standard Laemmli SDS buffer, and subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine the distribution of peroxisomal Pex14p and mitochondrial porin. Polyclonal antibodies directed against Pex14p (41Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Cell.. 1997; 89: 83-92Google Scholar) and porin (42Kerssen D. Hambruch E. Klaas W. Platta H.W. de Kruijff B. Erdmann R. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 27003-27015Google Scholar) were described previously. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The assay was carried out as described (11Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Google Scholar), based on the method of Fields and Song (43Fields S. Song O. Nature.. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar). PEX3, PEX22, and truncations thereof were fused to the Gal4p DNA-binding domain in vector pPC86, whereas PEX4 and PEX19 were fused to the transcription-activation domain of Gal4p in pPC97 (44Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Google Scholar). Appropriate plasmid combinations were cotransformed into yeast strain PJ69-4A and selected on synthetic dextrose plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. Transformed PJ69-4A was tested for concomitant histidine and adenine prototrophy by growth on selective plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Miscellaneous—Purification of GST-Pex19p and peptide scan analysis were carried out as described previously (11Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Google Scholar). Topology and Targeting Signals Are Similar for ScPex3p and ScPex22p—To learn more about the topogenesis of Pex3p in S. cerevisiae, we compared its targeting with that of Pex22p. The latter PMP bears a similar topology (Fig. 1A) but is not involved in membrane biogenesis (28Koller A. Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol.. 1999; 146: 99-112Google Scholar). A C-terminal GFP fusion of Pex22p gave rise to a punctate staining pattern that was congruent with that of PTS2-DsRed (Fig. 1B), a synthetic peroxisomal marker protein (36Stein K. Schell-Steven A. Erdmann R. Rottensteiner H. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2002; 22: 6056-6069Google Scholar). Peroxisomal localization was also visible for the N-terminal 35 amino acids of Pex22p, although some perinuclear ER staining was additionally discernible (Fig. 1C). The complementary fragment comprising the large cytosolic domain of Pex22p (amino acids 36-180) led to a diffuse staining pattern typical for a cytosolic localization and expected for a fragment that lacks a TMD (Fig. 1D). Similarly, and consistent with published work (22Tam Y.Y. Fagarasanu A. Fagarasanu M. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 34933-34939Google Scholar), peroxisomal targeting of Pex3p was observed for the full-length protein (Fig. 1E) and its N-terminal 45 amino acids (Fig. 1F), whereas the complementary C-terminal fragment (amino acids 46-441) was localized to the cytosol (Fig. 1G). Thus, the targeting signals of Pex3p and Pex22p are comprised of the extreme N termini and include the single TMD (Fig. 1A), whereas the large C-terminal domains are not required for targeting. The mPTS of Pex3p and Pex22p Do Not Interact with Pex19p—Common among the mPTS of several PMPs is the presence of at least one Pex19p-binding site, which is typically composed of a linear sequence of ∼15 amino acids enriched for hydrophobic and basic residues (10Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol.. 2004; 164: 57-67Google Scholar, 11Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Google Scholar). Such sites are readily detectable by peptide scan analysis (11Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 3406-3417Google Scholar, 45Halbach A. Lorenzen S. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Rottensteiner H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 21176-21182Google Scholar); however, purified Pex19p bound neither to overlapping 20-mer peptides covering the first 50 amino acids of Pex3p or Pex22p (i.e. their mPTS) nor to 15-mer peptides representing the entire proteins (not shown). A yeast two-hybrid assay was used to test for Pex19p interaction in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), neither the mPTS of Pex3p (amino acids 1-45) nor that of Pex22p (amino acids 1-35) showed an interaction with Pex19p. The strong interaction of full-length Pex3p with Pex19p reflects the established function of Pex3p as a docking protein for Pex19p and is apparently not linked to its targeting, similar to observations made in mammals (10Jones J.M. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol.. 2004; 164: 57-67Google Scholar). An interaction of Pex19p with Pex22p was not observed. That the fusion proteins employed were correctly folded can be inferred from the interaction of full-length Pex22p (amino acids 1-180) and its cytosolic domain (amino acids 36-180) with Pex4p, a known interaction partner of Pex22p (Fig. 2C). Pex3p did not interact with Pex4p, confirming that the C termini of Pex3p and Pex22p serve distinct functions. The Pex19p interaction data suggested that targeting of Pex22p and Pex3p is independent of Pex19p and thus differs markedly from that of other PMPs. Notably, the mPTS sequences of Pex3p and Pex22p are not only similarly positioned but also quite similar in sequence; within the first 31 amino acids, ∼42% of the residues are identical (Fig. 2D). Pex3p and Pex22p Accumulate in the Same Compartment in the Absence of Pex19p—Localization of Pex3p and Pex22p was analyzed in pex19Δ cells lacking peroxisomes. In this mutant strain, Pex3p is believed to accumulate in distinct regions of the ER (17Hoepfner D. Schildknegt D. Braakman I. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Cell.. 2005; 122: 85-95Google Scholar, 18Motley A.M. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol.. 2007; 178: 399-410Google Scholar) and poised to form peroxisomes, whereas Pex19p-dependent PMPs are mislocalized or degraded. Labeling of the ER with Cyb5p-DsRed revealed that the majority of Pex3p and Pex22p was localized to punctate structures within or in vicinity to the ER (Fig. 3, A and B) (18Motley A.M. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol.. 2007; 178: 399-410Google Scholar). Because of the similar staining pattern of Pex3p and Pex22p, a DsRed fusion of Pex22p was coexpressed with Pex3p-GFP in a pex19Δ mutant. A clear congruent staining was discernible, demonstrating colocalization of the two proteins (Fig. 3C). These data support the hypothesis that Pex3p and Pex22p share the same targeting pathway. The mPTS of Pex3p and Pex22p Are Interchangeable—The semblance in mPTS might point to a common import pathway for Pex3p and Pex22p. We therefore tested whether an exchange of the targeting signals of Pex3p and Pex22p would retain correct peroxisomal topogenesis. In a wild-type strain, a chimera of Pex3p1-45 and Pex22p36-180 faithfully transported GFP to peroxisomes and so did Pex22p1-35-Pex3p46-441, as demonstrated by a colabeling with the synthetic peroxisomal marker protein DsRed-SKL in a wild-type strain (Figs. 4A and 5A). Targeting efficiency of the mPTS of Pex22p was even increased in the presence of the cytoplasmic domain of Pex3p (compare with Fig. 1C). From these results it was concluded that the mutual exchange of the mPTS did not compromise the targeting of Pex3p and Pex22p.FIGURE 5Targeting and de novo peroxisome formation are retained upon exchanging the mPTS of Pex3p by that of Pex22p. A, targeting of a chimera comprising the mPTS of Pex22p and the cytoplasmic domain of Pex3p. A C-terminal GFP fusion of this chimera was expressed together with PTS2-DsRed in a wild-type strain (yHPR251). Peroxisomal colocalization of the chimera becomes evident in the merged image. B-F, test for complementation of the pex3Δ matrix protein import defect by the Pex22pN-Pex3pC chimera. Pex3Δ strains coexpressing C-terminal GFP fusions of Pex3p (B), the mPTS of Pex3p (C), the cytoplasmic domain of Pex3p (D), the mPTS of Pex22p (E), and the Pex22pN-Pex3pC chimera (F) together with DsRed-SKL as matrix marker were subjected to fluorescence microscopy. The Pex22pN-Pex3pC-chimera and Pex3p clearly reconstituted matrix protein import, evident by a punctate staining pattern for DsRed-SKL. Bar, 2 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Pex3pN-Pex22pC Chimera Can Functionally Complement a pex22Δ Mutant—We next examined the potential of the Pex3p-Pex22p chimeras to functionally replace Pex22p. Because of its essential role in Pex4p recruitment to the peroxisomal membrane, matrix protein import is disabled in the absence of Pex22p, which can be visualized by a cytosolic distribution of the synthetic peroxisomal marker protein DsRed-SKL (Fig. 4B). Membrane protein targeting, on the other hand, is not affected in the pex22Δ mutant, as demonstrated by a congruent, punctate staining pattern for Pex3p and Ant1p (Fig. 4C). Expression of Pex22p restored peroxisomal localization of the matrix protein marker (Fig. 4D), whereas Pex3p (Fig. 4B) and Pex22p36-180 (Fig. 4E) failed to do so. Interestingly, the Pex22p chimera harboring the mPTS of Pex3p and the cytoplasmic domain of Pex22p clearly provoked a relocation of DsRed-SKL into peroxisomes (Fig. 4F). The ability of Pex3p1-45-Pex22p36-180 to complement the import defect of a pex22Δ mutant was also analyzed by a test for growth on solid agar medium containing oleic acid as the sole carbon source. Because in yeast, peroxisomes are essential for the breakdown of fatty acids, cells devoid of functional peroxisomes as in the pex22Δ mutant cannot utilize oleic acid and as a consequence neither grow efficiently nor form the typical halo on such plates. Halo formation was restored upon expression of Pex22p and Pex3p1-45-Pex22p36-180 but not of Pex22p1-35-Pex3p46-441 (Fig. 4G). The combined results indicated that Pex3p1-45-Pex22p36-180 had inserted into the membrane with the correct topology. Furthermore, it demonstrated that the Pex22p-specific function is contained within its cytoplasmic domain, whereas its N-terminal domain is required for targeting and insertion into the peroxisomal membrane. The Pex22pN-Pex3pC Chimera Restores Peroxisome Formation in pex3Δ Cells—In the absence of Pex3p, peroxisomes are considered to be missing, yet the reintroduction of Pex3p allows their restoration (15South S.T.

https://openalex.org/W2123200842,"Sliding-window analysis has widely been used to uncover synonymous (silent, d(S)) and nonsynonymous (replacement, d(N)) rate variation along the protein sequence and to detect regions of a protein under selective constraint (indicated by d(N)<d(S)) or positive selection (indicated by d(N)>d(S)). The approach compares two or more protein-coding genes and plots estimates d(/\)(S) and d(/\)(N) from each sliding window along the sequence. Here we demonstrate that the approach produces artifactual trends of synonymous and nonsynonymous rate variation, with greater variation in d(/\)(S) than in d(/\)(N). Such trends are generated even if the true d(S) and d(N) are constant along the whole protein and different codons are evolving independently. Many published tests of negative and positive selection using sliding windows that we have examined appear to be invalid because they fail to correct for multiple testing. Instead, likelihood ratio tests provide a more rigorous framework for detecting signals of natural selection affecting protein evolution. We demonstrate that a previous finding that a particular region of the BRCA1 gene experienced a synonymous rate reduction driven by purifying selection is likely an artifact of the sliding window analysis. We evaluate various sliding-window analyses in molecular evolution, population genetics, and comparative genomics, and argue that the approach is not generally valid if it is not known a priori that a trend exists and if no correction for multiple testing is applied."
https://openalex.org/W2006263017,"The population genetics of pathogenic bacteria has been intensively studied in order to understand the spread of disease and the evolution of virulence and drug resistance. However, much less attention has been paid to bacterial carriage populations, which inhabit hosts without producing disease. Since new virulent strains that cause disease can be recruited from the carriage population of bacteria, our understanding of infectious disease is seriously incomplete without knowledge on the population structure of pathogenic bacteria living in an asymptomatic host. We report the first extensive survey of the abundance and diversity of a human pathogen in asymptomatic animal hosts. We have found that asymptomatic swine from livestock productions frequently carry populations of Salmonella enterica with a broad range of drug-resistant strains and genetic diversity greatly exceeding that previously described. This study shows how agricultural practice and human intervention may lead and influence the evolution of a hidden reservoir of pathogens, with important implications for human health."
https://openalex.org/W2112176133,"A colorful variety of fluorescent proteins (FPs) from marine invertebrates are utilized as genetically encoded markers for live cell imaging. The increased demand for advanced imaging techniques drives a continuous search for FPs with new and improved properties. Many useful FPs have been isolated from species adapted to sun-flooded habitats such as tropical coral reefs. It has yet remained unknown if species expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like proteins also exist in the darkness of the deep sea. Using a submarine-based and -operated fluorescence detection system in the Gulf of Mexico, we discovered ceriantharians emitting bright green fluorescence in depths between 500 and 600 m and identified a GFP, named cerFP505, with bright fluorescence emission peaking at 505 nm. Spectroscopic studies showed that approximately 15% of the protein bulk feature reversible ON/OFF photoswitching that can be induced by alternating irradiation with blue und near-UV light. Despite being derived from an animal adapted to essentially complete darkness and low temperatures, cerFP505 maturation in living mammalian cells at 37 degrees C, its brightness and photostability are comparable to those of EGFP and cmFP512 from shallow water species. Therefore, our findings disclose the deep sea as a potential source of GFP-like molecular marker proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2112352676,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) exert profound influences on many physiologic functions by virtue of their diverse roles in growth, development, and maintenance of homeostasis. We previously created a novel gain of function in the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR), hGRM604L, which is active at GC concentrations 5-10-fold lower than wild-type GR. To gain a greater insight into GC physiology in vivo, we inserted this mutant GR (GRM610L in mice) into mice via homologous recombination. Mice expressing the allele are phenotypically normal with respect to GC function. However, corticosterone levels, ACTH levels, and adrenocortical size are markedly reduced, suggesting they are phenotypically normal because the mutant GR alters the basal regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We demonstrate via physiologic and immunologic studies that GRM610L mice have increased sensitivity to GCs in vivo. Sensitivity to the actions of endogenous GCs may be an important factor underlying the development of many human diseases including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Our model may provide a new and powerful tool for the study of GC physiological and pathological processes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2061309502,"The red imported fire ant (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta, is an invasive species, accidentally introduced in the United States that can cause painful (sometimes life-threatening) stings to human, pets, and livestock. Their colonies have two social forms: monogyne and polygyne that have a single and multiple functional queens, respectively. A major gene (Gp-9), identified as a putative pheromone-binding protein on the basis of a modest amino acid sequence identity, has been suggested to influence the expression of colony social organization. Monogyne queens are reported to possess only the GP-9B alleles, whereas polygyne queens possess both GP-9B and GP-9b. Thus, both social forms are reported to express GP-9B, with GP-9b being a marker expressed in polygynes but it is absent in monogynes. Here, we report two types of polygyne colonies, one that does not express GP-9b (monogyne-like) and the other expressing both proteins, GP-9B and GP-9b. Given their expression pattern, GP-9s are hemolymph proteins, which are more likely to be involved in the transport of lipids and small ligands within the homocoel. GP-9B existed in two forms, one of them is phosphorylated. The helical-rich content of the protein resembles the secondary structures of a beetle hemolymph protein and moth pheromone-binding proteins. An olfactory role is unlikely given the lack of specific expression in the sensillar lymph. In marked contrast to GP-9s, a chemosensory protein, SinvCSP, is demonstrated to be specifically expressed in the antennae. Within the antennae, expression of SinvCSP is restricted to the last two segments, which are known to house olfactory sensilla."
https://openalex.org/W2033170435,"RecF pathway proteins play an important role in the restart of stalled replication and DNA repair in prokaryotes. Following DNA damage, RecF, RecR, and RecO initiate homologous recombination (HR) by loading of the RecA recombinase on single-stranded (ss) DNA, protected by ssDNA-binding protein. The specific role of RecF in this process is not well understood. Previous studies have proposed that RecF directs the RecOR complex to boundaries of damaged DNA regions by recognizing single-stranded/double-stranded (ss/ds) DNA junctions. RecF belongs to ABC-type ATPases, which function through an ATP-dependent dimerization. Here, we demonstrate that the RecF of <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> interacts with DNA as an ATP-dependent dimer, and that the DNA binding and ATPase activity of RecF depend on both the structure of DNA substrate, and the presence of RecR. We found that RecR interacts as a tetramer with the RecF dimer. RecR increases the RecF affinity to dsDNA without stimulating ATP hydrolysis but destabilizes RecF binding to ssDNA and dimerization, likely due to increasing the ATPase rate. The DNA-dependent binding of RecR to the RecF-DNA complex occurs through specific protein-protein interactions without significant contributions from RecR-DNA interactions. Finally, RecF neither alone nor in complex with RecR preferentially binds to the ss/dsDNA junction. Our data suggest that the specificity of the RecFOR complex toward the boundaries of DNA damaged regions may result from a network of protein-protein and DNA-protein interactions, rather than a simple recognition of the ss/dsDNA junction by RecF."
https://openalex.org/W2163551727,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone Hho1p is not essential for cell viability, and very little is known about its function in vivo. We show that deletion of HHO1 (hho1Δ) suppresses the defect in transcriptional silencing caused by a mutation in the globular domain of histone H4. hho1Δ also suppresses the reduction in HML silencing by the deletion of SIR1 that is involved in the establishment of silent chromatin at HML. We further show that hho1Δ suppresses changes in silent chromatin structure caused by the histone H4 mutation and sir1Δ. These results suggest that HHO1 plays a negative role in transcriptionally silent chromatin. We also provide evidence that Hho1p hinders the de novo establishment of silent chromatin but does not affect the stability of preexistent silent chromatin. Unlike canonical linker histones in higher eukaryotes that have a single conserved globular domain, Hho1p possesses two globular domains. We show that the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of Hho1p is dispensable for its function, suggesting that the mode of Hho1p action is similar to that of canonical linker histones.

The eukaryotic genome is packed into chromatin that plays a key role in regulating DNA transactions, including transcription, replication, and recombination. The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome consisting of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a protein core composed of two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6975) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes in chromatin are connected by linker DNAs whose average lengths vary from organism to organism (2Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Fan Y. Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Linker DNAs associate with linker histones, referred to as histone H1, that bind DNA near the entry and exit points of the nucleosome. There is evidence that linker histones facilitate chromatin condensation and regulate the 30 nm chromatin fiber structure in vitro (3Robinson P.J. Rhodes D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Since linker histones are involved in the formation of higher order chromatin structures and repress chromatin transcription in vitro (4Hannon R. Bateman E. Allan J. Harborne N. Gould H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Shimamura A. Sapp M. Rodriguez-Campos A. Worcel A. Mol.

Science. 1991; 254: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), it was originally believed that they function as global transcription repressors in vivo. However, increasing evidence demonstrates that this is not the case. In mice, reducing the level of histone H1 to 50% of its normal level causes dramatic changes in chromatin structure, including a general decrease in nucleosome spacing and reduced chromatin compaction (7Fan Y. Nikitina T. Zhao J. Fleury T.J. Bhattacharyya R. Bouhassira E.E. Stein C.L. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I.

Similarly, in Tetrahymena thermophilia, deletion of histone H1 reduces global chromatin compaction and affects transcription of specific genes but does not have a major effect on global transcription (8Shen X.

The functions of linker histones are essential in mice, and reducing the level of histone H1 by half leads to embryonic lethality (10Fan Y. Nikitina T. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Zhao J. Magnuson T.R. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4559-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). On the other hand, linker histones in lower eukaryotes, such as Tetrahymena and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not essential for cell survival (8Shen X. Yu L. Weir J.W.

Linker histones can be divided into two major families based on their structural characteristics (12Kasinsky H.E. Lewis J.D. Dacks J.B. Ausio J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Members of one family have a tripartite structure consisting of a conserved globular domain flanked by a short NH2-terminal tail and a long COOH-terminal tail that are both lysine-rich, highly charged, and relatively unstructured. Linker histones in the other family lack the conserved globular domain and contain only the equivalent of the COOH-terminal domain of the tripartite family. Tripartite linker histones are generally found in multicellular eukaryotes, whereas the single domain ones are found in certain protists, such as Tetrahymena. A search of yeast genome sequence for homologs of the conserved globular domain of histone H1 identified the HHO1 gene (13Landsman D. Trends Biochem.

Interestingly, the sequence of HHO1 predicts a protein that resembles the tripartite linker histone but contains a second globular domain fused to its COOH terminus (12Kasinsky H.E. Lewis J.D.

The two globular domains of Hho1p (GI and GII) can form similar secondary and tertiary structures in vitro, but GI is significantly more stable than GII under physiological salt conditions (15Ono K. Kusano O. Shimotakahara S. Shimizu M. Yamazaki T. Shindo H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7199-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Ali T. Coles P. Stevens T.J. Stott K. Thomas J.O. J.

Initial biochemical analyses of recombinant Hho1p suggest that it has properties similar to those of canonical tripartite linker histones (18Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7268-7276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Hho1p forms a stable 1:1 tertiary complex with reconstituted dinucleosomes, but its concentration in vivo is significantly less than that of the nucleosome cores (18Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7268-7276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Freidkin I. Katcoff D.J.

Deletion of HHO1 has no noticeable effect on cell growth (14Ushinsky S.C. Bussey H. Ahmed A.A. Wang Y. Friesen J. Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol.

Genet. 1997; 256: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and causes a reduction in the transcripts of only 27 of about 6000 genes by a factor of 2 or more, indicating that Hho1p positively regulates the expression of only a subset of genes (22Hellauer K. Turcotte B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13587-13592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There is evidence suggesting that Hho1p is inhibitory to homologous recombination (20Downs J.A. Kosmidou E. Morgan A. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1685-1692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Li C. Mueller J.E. Elfline M. Bryk M. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 906-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One interesting question regarding Hho1p is whether it plays any role in transcriptional silencing. Silencing occurs at the HML and HMR loci, regions near the telomeres, as well as the rDNA array in yeast, which is mediated by a special silent chromatin (24Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The establishment of silent chromatin is achieved via an initiation process that recruits the Sir complex consisting of Sir2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p to specific nucleation sequences, including the silencers flanking the HM loci and telomeric repeats. A Sir complex recruited to silencers or telomeric repeats is believed to deacetylate histones in adjacent nucleosomes through the deacetylase activity of Sir2p (25Moazed D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The deacetylated nucleosomes then bind additional Sir complexes. This is because the Sir complex self-interacts and preferentially binds hypoacetylated histones. Through repeated cycles of histone deacetylation and Sir complex recruitment, Sir complexes propagate along the chromatin. Each silencer at the HM loci consists of binding sites for origin recognition complex (ORC), 3The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; ORF, open reading frame; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; FRT, Flp1p recombination target; RT, reverse transcription; IP, immunoprecipitation; FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; SC, synthetic complete. Rap1p, and/or Abf1p. The silencer-binding factors recruit the Sir complex through a direct interaction between ORC and Sir1p that binds to Sir4p and the binding of Rap1p to Sir3p or Sir4p. Sir1p acts only in the establishment of silent chromatin, and its deletion reduces but does not eliminate silencing (26Pillus L. Rine J. Cell. 1989; 59: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 27Xu E.Y. Zawadzki K.A. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 219-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As a nucleosome-interacting protein, Hho1p has the potential to influence the formation and maintenance of silent chromatin. However, deletion of HHO1 seems to have no effect on silencing at HM loci, telomeres, and rDNA (14Ushinsky S.C. Bussey H. Ahmed A.A. Wang Y. Friesen J. Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol.

On the other hand, we found that overexpression of HHO1 has an inhibitory effect on silencing (28Veron M. Zou Y. Yu Q. Bi X. Selmi A. Gilson E. Defossez P.A. Genetics. 2006; 173: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We show in this work that Hho1p functionally interacts with core histone H4 and Sir1p and negatively regulates the de novo establishment of silent chromatin. We also present evidence suggesting that Hho1p functionally resembles canonical tripartite linker histones. Plasmids and Strains—The DNA sequence from coordinates 308227 to 310203 of chromosome XVI encompassing the HHO1 ORF plus 600-bp upstream and 600-bp downstream sequences was PCR-amplified. XhoI and SpeI sites were added to the ends of this fragment during PCR to yield the XhoI-HHO1-SpeI fragment that was inserted into pRS414 (CEN-TRP1) to make pQY288. A similar BglII-HHO1-BglII fragment was inserted into pYEP13 (2 μm-LEU2) to yield pYEP13-HHO1. pQY290 was made by precisely deleting the sequence corresponding to the COOH-terminal 87 amino acids of Hho1p from pQY288. pQY292 and -293 were similarly constructed by deleting from pQY288 HHO1 sequences corresponding to amino acids 1–118 and 1–40, respectively. The HHO1 allele in each plasmid was confirmed by sequencing. pQY318 and -319 were made by replacing the HHO1 ORF in pQY288 with the ORFs of Xenopus H1° and human H1.1 genes, respectively. pMS337, -364, -366, and -367 are CEN-LEU2 plasmids encoding HHT1-HHF1, HHT1-hhf1-Y88G, HHT1-hhf1-Y98H, and HHT1-hhf1-Y98W, respectively, and pMS329 is CEN-URA3-HHT1-HHF1 (29Santisteban M.S. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Smith M.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2493-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). pUC-SK was made by inserting the sir3-8 allele and KanMX into pUC19. Yeast strains are listed in Table 1. Strains 1m, 3m, 5m, and 7m were derived from Y1838 (MATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ pMS329, from J. R. Broach) by replacing its pMS329 with pMS337, -364, -366, and -367, respectively. Strains 2m, 4m, 6m, and 8m were made by replacing the HHO1 ORF in 1m, 3m, 5m, and 7m with KanMX, respectively. Strains 1–8 were made by transforming 1m–8m, respectively, to Ura+ with EcoRI-SalI-digested pT1 (30Bi X. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Zou Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2118-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Strains 9–12 were made by transforming 1m–4m to Ura+ with HindIII-digested p114 (31Zou Y. Yu Q. Chiu Y.-H. Bi X. Genetics. 2006; 174: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The HMR-E silencer in these strains was inverted to enhance silencing on the left of HMR (31Zou Y. Yu Q. Chiu Y.-H. Bi X. Genetics. 2006; 174: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Strains 13–16 were made by transforming 1m–4m to Ura+ with BamHI-digested p102 (31Zou Y. Yu Q. Chiu Y.-H. Bi X. Genetics. 2006; 174: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The HML-I silencer in these strains was inverted to enhance silencing on the right of HML (31Zou Y. Yu Q. Chiu Y.-H. Bi X. Genetics. 2006; 174: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Strains 17 and 18 were made by transforming pYEP13 and pYEP13-HHO1 into 9, respectively. Strains 19 and 20 were made by transforming pYEP13 and pYEP13-HHO1 into 13, respectively. Strains 21 and 22 were made by replacing the CEN-URA3-HHF1 plasmid in YXB102 (32Xu E.Y. Bi X. Holland M.J. Gottschling D.E. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1846-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with pRS414-HHF1 and -hhf1-Y88G, respectively. HHO1 in strains 21 and 22 was replaced by URA3 to yield 23 and 24, respectively. Strain 25 was derived from 21 by replacing its SIR3 with URA3. Strains 26 and 27 were made by transforming 1 and 3, respectively, to Geneticin-resistant with a PCR-produced fragment encoding 9-Myc linked to KanMX embedded in a sequence spanning the 3′ region of HHO1 ORF. Strains 28–30 are from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Strain 31 was made by replacing HHO1 in 30 with LEU2. Strains 32, 34, and 36 have been described (33Bi X. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Elizondo S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34Zou Y. Bi X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5189-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Strain 37 was made by transforming 36 to Geneticin-resistant with Tth111I-digested pUC-SK. Strains 33, 35, and 38 were made by replacing HHO1 in 32, 34, and 37, respectively, with NatMX. Strains 39–45 were made by transforming plasmids pRS414 and pQY288, -290, -293, -292, -318, and -319, respectively, into strain 4. The relevant genotypes of all of the strains constructed in this work were confirmed by PCR and/or Southern blotting.TABLE 1Yeast strainsNumberNameGenotype1mYQY385mMATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ pMS337 (CEN-LEU2-HHT1-HHF1)1YQY385YQY385m, Tel VII-L-URA32mYQY386mYQY385m, hho1Δ::KanMX2YQY386YQY386m, Tel VII-L-URA33mYQY355mMATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ pMS364 (CEN-LEU2-HHT1-hhf1-Y88G)3YQY355YQY355m, Tel VII-L-URA34mYQY356mYQY355m, hho1Δ::KanMX4YQY356YQY356m, Tel VII-L-URA35mYQY452mMATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ pMS366 (CEN-LEU2-HHT1-hhf1-Y98H)5YQY452YQY452m, Tel VII-L-URA36mYQY500mYQY452m, hho1Δ::KanMX6YQY500YQY500m, Tel VII-L-URA37mYQY450mMATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ pMS367 (CEN-LEU2-HHT1-hhf1-Y98W)7YQY450YQY450m, Tel VII-L-URA38mYQY451mYQY450m, hho1Δ::KanMX8YQY451YQY451m, Tel VII-L-URA39YQY379MATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ URA3-HMR-E(inverted)-HMRa-HMR-I pMS337 (CEN-LEU2-HHT1-HHF1)10YQY380YQY379, hho1Δ::KanMX11YQY368MATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ URA3-HMR-E(inverted)-HMRa-HMR-I pMS364 (CEN-LEU2-HHT1-hhf1-Y88G)12YQY384YQY368, hho1Δ::KanMX13YQY377MATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ HML-E-HMLα-HML-I(inverted)-URA3 pMS337 (CEN-LEU2-HHT1-HHF1)14YQY378YQY377, hho1Δ::KanMX15YQY367MATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ HML-E-HMLα-HML-I(inverted)-URA3 pMS364 (CEN-LEU2-HHT1-hhf1-Y88G)16YQY383YQY367, hho1Δ::KanMX17YQY379 + pYEP13 (2 μm-LEU2)18YQY379 + pYEP13-HHO119YQY377 + pYEP1320YQY377 + pYEP13-HHO121YXB803MATa ura3-52 ade2-101 can1-100 trp1Δ901 his3Δ200 his5-1 LEU2-GAL10-FLP1 hhf1Δ::HIS3 hhf2Δ::LEU2 E-FRT-hml::β-FRT-I pRS414-HHF1(CEN-TRP1-HHF1) [ciro]22YXB815MATa ura3-52 ade2-101 can1-100 trp1Δ901 his3Δ200 his5-1 LEU2-GAL10-FLP1 hhf1Δ::HIS3 hhf2Δ::LEU2 E-FRT-hml::β-FRT-I pRS414-hhf1-Y88G [ciro]23YQY566YXB803, hho1Δ::URA324YQY567YXB815, hho1Δ::URA325YQY570YXB803, sir3Δ::URA326YQY478MATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ Tel VII-L-URA3 HHO1-Myc-KanMX pMS337 (CEN-LEU2-HHT1-HHF1)27YQY479MATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ trp1-289 (hht1-hhf1)Δ (hht2-hhf2)Δ Tel VII-L-URA3 HHO1-Myc-KanMX pMS363 (CEN-LEU2-HHT1-hhf1-Y88G)28BY4741MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ029BY4741, hho1Δ::KanMX30BY4741, sir1Δ::KanMX31YYZ333BY4741, sir1Δ::KanMX hho1Δ::LEU232YXB10MATa ura3-52 ade2-1 lys1-1 his5-1 can1-100 LEU2-GAL10-FLP1 FRT-E-hml::β1-I-FRT [ciro]33YHK13YXB10, hho1Δ::NatMX34YXB810YXB10, sir1::URA335YHK14YXB810, hho1Δ::NatMX36YXB10sYXB10, sir3::URA337YXB814YXB10s, sir3-8-KanMX38YHK16YXB814, hho1Δ::NatMX39YQY512YQY354 + pRS414 (CEN-TRP1)40YQY513YQY354 + pQY288 (CEN-TRP1-HHO1)41YQY514YQY354 + pQY290 (CEN-TRP1-hho1-ΔGII)42YQY516YQY354 + pQY293 (CEN-TRP1-hho1-ΔN)43YQY517YQY354 + pQY292 (CEN-TRP1-hho1-ΔN-GI)44YQY354 + pQ318 (CEN-TRP1-XI-H1)45YQY354 + pQ319 (CEN-TRP1-Hs-H1) Open table in a new tab RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from log phase cells and diluted to a concentration of 1 μg/ml. The sample was treated with DNase I and then used as template for RT-PCR with the SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR system with Platinum® TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction. For measuring the transcript of SIR1, SIR2, SIR3, or SIR4, 1 μl of RNA was used in a 25-cycle PCR. For ACT1,1 μl of RNA was used in a 20-cycle PCR. PCR products were fractionated on 2.0% agarose gels. The proper amount of RNA used as template in RT-PCR was predetermined to be in the linear range by serial dilutions. No-RT control PCR was performed by using Platinum® TaqDNA polymerase instead of the RT/Platinum® Taq mix. Analysis of DNA Topology—Cells grown in YPR medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, and 2% raffinose) were treated with galactose (2%) for 2.5 h to induce the expression of PGAL10-FLP1. Nucleic acids were isolated using the glass bead method and fractionated on agarose gels supplemented with 13 μg/ml chloroquine. DNA circles were detected by Southern blotting. The profiles of topoisomers were determined by using the NIH Image software. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was carried out as described (35Chiu Y.H. Yu Q. Sandmeier J.J. Bi X. Genetics. 2003; 165: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the culture (50 ml) was grown to log phase and then fixed for 25 min at room temperature in 1% formaldehyde. Cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled H2O and FA-Lysis 140 buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholic acid (catalog number P-8215; Sigma) at 15 μl/ml). Cell pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of FA-Lysis 140 and lysed using the glass bead method. The extract was then sonicated with a Branson Sonifier 450, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation. According to the A260, 120 units of whole-cell extract was added to each IP for a final volume of 240 μl in FA-Lysis 140. Myc antibody was added at 1.5 μl/IP. Incubation of IP reactions was done at 4 °C overnight. Bound chromatin was precipitated with Protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and the immune complexes were eluted twice with 200 μl of 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 at room temperature. The cross-links were then reversed at 65 °C for 5 h in the presence of NaCl and ethanol-precipitated overnight at –20 °C. The recovered material was RNase A- and Proteinase K-treated and phenol/chloroform-extracted. Purified DNA was resuspended in 150 μl of 1× Tris-EDTA. Six μl of each sample was used in 25-μl PCRs for 28 cycles. In PCRs, the proper amount of input and immunoprecipitated chromatin DNA used was predetermined to be in the linear range by serial dilutions. Input chromatin was added to PCRs as a 1:10 dilution. PCR products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel. ChIP data were analyzed as described in “Results”. The sequences of the PCR primers used are available upon request. Deletion of HHO1 Suppresses the Defect in Transcriptional Silencing Caused by the Y88G Mutation in Histone H4—In an attempt to systematically investigate the potential role of HHO1 in transcriptional silencing, we monitored silencing of the URA3 reporter placed near Tel VII-L (the left telomere of chromosome VII) and the HML and HMR loci in HHO1 wild type and null strains (Fig. 1, A, C, and D, top). URA3 silencing was measured as cell growth on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA), since cells expressing URA3 are sensitive to killing by FOA (36van Leeuwen F. Gottschling D.E. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As predicted, URA3 was strongly silenced at Tel VII-L and the HM loci in wild type cells (Fig. 1, robust growth of strains 1, 9, and 13 on FOA medium). Deletion of HHO1 had no effect on URA3 silencing (Fig. 1, compare 2 with 1, 10 with 9, and 14 with 13 on FOA). This is consistent with previous studies that revealed no role of HHO1 in transcriptional silencing (14Ushinsky S.C. Bussey H. Ahmed A.A. Wang Y. Friesen J. Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Patterton H.G. Landel C.C. Landsman D. Peterson C.L. Simpson R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7268-7276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Escher D. Schaffner W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, it is formally possible that Hho1p plays a role in silencing that is redundant with or antagonistic to functions of other factors, such as histones, involved in the formation and/or maintenance of silent chromatin. To test this idea, we set out to look for synthetic effects of hho1Δ and histone mutations on transcriptional silencing. A salient feature of silent chromatin is the hypoacetylation of lysines in the NH2-terminal tails of core histones (24Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). We examined if hho1Δ had synthetic interactions with a series of lysine to arginine or glutamine mutations in the NH2-terminal tails of H3 and H4 but found that hho1Δ neither suppressed nor exacerbated the phenotypes of the histone mutants with regard to telomeric silencing, cell growth, and resistance to the DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (data not shown). Therefore, we found no evidence for functional interactions between Hho1p and the NH2-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4. We next examined if Hho1p functionally interacts with the globular domains of core histones that interact to form the nucleosome core. Three tyrosine residues, Tyr-72, -88, and -98, in the globular domain of histone H4 play a key role in the interaction between the H3/H4 tetramer and the H2A/H2B dimers (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6975) Google Scholar, 29Santisteban M.S. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Smith M.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2493-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Santisteban et al. (29Santisteban M.S. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Smith M.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2493-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of these tyrosine residues by showing that H4-Y72G, -Y88G, and -Y98H mutants are sensitive to high temperatures (Ts–) (Fig. 1A, compare 3 and 5 with 1 at 37 °C). Here we showed that the H4-Y88G and -Y98H mutants were also sensitive to MMS (Fig. 1A, compare 3 and 5 with 1 on MMS). Moreover, the Y88G mutation abolished URA3 silencing near Tel VII-L or the HM loci (Fig. 1, compare 3 with 1, 11 with 9, and 15 with 13 on FOA). On the other hand, cells with H4 Tyr-98 changed to tryptophan, a substitution that conserved the side chain aromatic ring, had none of the phenotypes of Y88G or Y98H (Fig. 1A, compare 7 with 1). These results support the notion that hydrophobic interactions between H3/H4 and H2A/H2B mediated by H4 Tyr-88 and Tyr-98 are important for various cellular functions. HHO1 deletion partially suppressed the defect in telomeric silencing of the H4-Y88G mutant (Fig. 1A, compare 4 with 3 on FOA). It also partially suppressed the silencing defect at the HM loci (Fig. 1, C and D, compare 12 with 11 and 16 with 15 on FOA). In addition, hho1Δ suppressed the Ts– phenotype and, to a lesser extent, MMS sensitivity of H4-Y88G (Fig. 1A, 37 °C and MMS panels, compare 4 with 3). HHO1 deletion had no effect on the phenotypes of the H4-Y98H and -Y98W mutants (Fig. 1A, compare 6 with 5 and 8 with 7). These results demonstrate that Hho1p functionally interacts with histone H4 in an allele-specific manner and plays a negative role in various cellular functions, including transcriptional silencing. Consistently, increasing the dosage of the HHO1 gene reduced transcriptional silencing in histone H4 wild type cells (Fig. 1, E and F, compare 18 with 17 and 20 with 19). It is formally possible that restoration of silencing in the H4-Y88G mutant by hho1Δ is due to increased expression of the SIR1 through SIR4 genes. However, the levels of the SIR genes as measured by RT-PCR in the H4-Y88G hho1Δ double mutant were not significantly different from those in the H4-Y88G and hho1Δ single mutants (Fig. 1B). Therefore, hho1Δ does not suppress the silencing defect of H4-Y88G by increasing the expression of SIR genes. Hho1p Plays a Negative Role in Silent Chromatin—We investigated whether the negative role of HHO1 in silencing revealed above reflected changes in the structure of silent chromatin using a DNA topology-based assay. The topology of eukaryotic DNA is determined by multiple factors, including the density of nucleosomes along the DNA and the configurations of nucleosomes. The major contribution to the negative supercoiling of DNA is its wrapping into nucleosomes with an average linking number change (ΔLk) of about –1 per nucleosome formed (37Germond J.E. Hirt B.

Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). DNA at HML and HMR is more negatively supercoiled when these loci are silenced than when they are derepressed, and the degree of negative supercoiling is an indicator of the state of silent chromatin (39Bi X.

The increased resilience of this pathogen is due, to a great extent, to its complex, polysaccharide-rich, and unusually impermeable cell wall. The synthesis of this essential structure is still poorly understood despite the fact that enzymes involved in glycosidic bond synthesis represent more than 1% of all M. tuberculosis ORFs identified to date. One of them is GpgS, a retaining glycosyltransferase (GT) with low sequence homology to any other GTs of known structure, which has been identified in two species of mycobacteria and shown to be essential for the survival of M. tuberculosis. To further understand the biochemical properties of M. tuberculosis GpgS, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the apo enzyme, as well as of its ternary complex with UDP and 3-phosphoglycerate, by X-ray crystallography, to a resolution of 2.5 and 2.7 A, respectively. GpgS, the first enzyme from the newly established GT-81 family to be structurally characterized, displays a dimeric architecture with an overall fold similar to that of other GT-A-type glycosyltransferases. These three-dimensional structures provide a molecular explanation for the enzyme's preference for UDP-containing donor substrates, as well as for its glucose versus mannose discrimination, and uncover the structural determinants for acceptor substrate selectivity. Glycosyltransferases constitute a growing family of enzymes for which structural and mechanistic data urges. The three-dimensional structures of M. tuberculosis GpgS now determined provide such data for a novel enzyme family, clearly establishing the molecular determinants for substrate recognition and catalysis, while providing an experimental scaffold for the structure-based rational design of specific inhibitors, which lay the foundation for the development of novel anti-tuberculosis therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2054379473,"Efflux of cytosolic Ca2+ mediated by plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCA) plays a key role in fine tuning the magnitude and duration of Ca2+ signaling following activation of G-protein-coupled receptors. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin the trafficking of PMCA to the membrane during Ca2+ signaling remain largely unexplored in native cell models. One potential mechanism for the recruitment of proteins to the plasma membrane involves PDZ interactions. In this context, we investigated the role of PMCA interactions with the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF-2) during muscarinic-induced Ca2+ mobilization in the HT-29 epithelial cell line. GST pull-downs in HT-29 cell lysates showed that the PDZ2 module of NHERF-2 bound to the PDZ binding motif on the C terminus of PMCA. Co-immunoprecipitations confirmed that PMCA1b and NHERF-2 associated under normal conditions in HT-29 cells. Cell surface biotinylations revealed significant increases in membrane-associated NHERF-2 and PMCA within 60 s following muscarinic activation, accompanied by increased association of the two proteins as seen by confocal microscopy. The recruitment of NHERF-2 to the membrane preceded that of PMCA, suggesting that NHERF-2 was involved in nucleating an efflux complex at the membrane. The muscarinic-mediated translocation of PMCA was abolished when NHERF-2 was silenced, and the rate of relative Ca2+ efflux was also reduced. These experiments also uncovered a NHERF-2-independent PMCA retrieval mechanism. Our findings describe rapid agonist-induced translocation of PMCA in a native cell model and suggest that NHERF-2 plays a key role in scaffolding and maintaining PMCA at the cell membrane.

A change in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) is a key initiator of a multitude of cellular responses. Low resting [Ca2+]i is maintained by the sequestration of Ca2+ into intracellular stores or the extrusion of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane by transporters such as the ubiquitous plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) 3The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NHERF-2, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethylester; ACh, acetylcholine; CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PDZ, PSD-95/Dlg/Zo-1.

Many G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (such as purinergic and muscarinic receptors) signal via transient increases in [Ca2+]i to effect physiological responses (2Carafoli E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The increase in [Ca2+]i is biphasic, with an initial mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores which in turn triggers Ca2+ influx via ion channels in the plasma membrane. Following termination of receptor signaling, [Ca2+]i returns rapidly to resting levels due to refilling of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum as well as Ca2+ efflux mediated by PMCA and/or Na+-Ca2+ exchange (3Duman J.G. Chen L. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 131: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus the magnitude and duration of the increase in [Ca2+]i during the activation of a GPCR signaling cascade reflects a dynamic equilibrium between influx, reuptake, and efflux. Since the discovery of PMCA in the erythrocyte membrane in the mid-1960s (4Schatzmann H.J. Experientia. 1966; 22: 364-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), this ubiquitous enzyme has been well-defined as a primary mechanism for Ca2+ efflux from eukaryotic cells to maintain low resting Ca2+ levels (5Wanaverbecq N. Marsh S.J. Al-Qatari M. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PMCA is encoded by four separate genes that give rise to four distinct variants; PMCA1, -2, -3, and -4 (6Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). PMCA1 and -4 are thought to be ubiquitous, while the expression of PMCA2 and -3 is much more restricted predominantly in the brain and striated muscle (7Zylinska L. Kawecka I. Lachowicz L. Szemraj J. Cell Mol. Biol. Lett. 2002; 7: 1037-1045PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stauffer T.P. Guerini D. Celio M.R. Carafoli E. Brain Res. 1997; 748: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Alternate splicing of the original transcripts indicates that there are numerous PMCA variants in the mammalian proteome (9Brini M. Coletto L. Pierobon N. Kraev N. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24500-24508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The diversity of splice variants of PMCA is thought to allow for the complex and dynamic, spatio-temporal regulation of cell-specific Ca2+ handling (6Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The level of complexity of Ca2+ signaling may be increased by spatially constraining various regulatory components associated with the movement of Ca2+. Such supramolecular signaling platforms are already described for store-operated Ca2+ channels as well as their upstream, downstream, and regulatory components (10Ambudkar I.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 25-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and PMCAs are also reported to be part of such store-operated signaling complexes (11Kim J.Y. Zeng W.

PMCAs are known to interact with a number of cytosolic accessory and scaffold proteins that can direct the formation of Ca2+ signaling microdomains. These scaffolds include PSD-95/Dlg/Zo-1 (PDZ) proteins that are now recognized as playing key roles in aggregating receptors, ion channels, and transporters into functionally specific complexes in membrane microdomains (12Weinman E.J.

Due to alternate splicing of the mRNA transcripts at the C-terminal tail splice site C, there are 2 main variants of the PMCA isoforms denoted PMCAa and PMCAb. Importantly, all PMCAb splice variants have a PDZ consensus binding motif at their C terminus that has been shown to bind a wide variety of PDZ proteins (15Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Gambaryan S.

Sci. 2003; 986: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Some of these interactions have been shown to be physiologically relevant; for example, PDZ-mediated interactions between PMCA4b and nitric-oxide synthase I (NOS1) are essential for the regulation NO synthesis in the heart (20Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Telkamp M. Rothlein N. Neyses L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Oceandy D. Stanley P.J. Cartwright E.J. Neyses L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One family of PDZ proteins are the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factors, denoted NHERF-1 to -4 (22Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W.

Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C20Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). NHERF-1 was the first PDZ scaffold identified for an epithelial transporter. It was shown to direct the formation of a multi-protein complex that mediated cAMP-regulated protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation and inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) (24Weinman E.J.

NHERF-1 and -2 contain two PDZ modules (PDZ1 and PDZ2) that bind the PDZ binding motifs in the C terminus of target ion channels, receptors, and transporters (23Brone B. Eggermont J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C20Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). NHERF-1 and -2 also contain a C-terminal ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) binding domain that interacts with ERM proteins to link to the actin cytoskeleton. NHERF-1 and -2 can also nucleate the formation of macromolecular complexes by physically linking plasma membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton and recruiting signaling molecules such as PKA (26Yun C.H.

NHERF-2 has been reported to interact with PMCA2b when it was transiently transfected in (Madine Darby Canine Kidney) MDCK cells (18DeMarco S.J. Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10506-10511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of the interaction between PMCAs and NHERF-2, particularly in the context of endogenous GPCR-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i remain unexplored. Many of the intracellular kinases that have been shown to bind NHERF-2 such as PKC and PKA are also regulators of PMCA (33Zylinska L. Guerini D. Gromadzinska E. Lachowicz L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Coordinated signaling via NHERF-2 and modulation of PMCA-mediated efflux introduces a level of complexity that may account for the differences observed in the morphology of Ca2+ responses following GPCR activation (34Poronnik P. Cummins M.M. O'Mullane L.M. Cook D.I. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 36: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The human colonic epithelial cell line (HT-29) is an accepted model for studying Ca2+ signaling in epithelial cells and expresses only the M3 isoform of the muscarinic receptor (35Kopp R. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Moser U. Tacke R. Pfeiffer A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 172: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Muscarinic activation of HT-29 cells increases [Ca2+]i following activation of PLCβ by the βγ-subunits and release of Ca2+ stores and subsequent Ca2+ influx (34Poronnik P. Cummins M.M. O'Mullane L.M.

Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of muscarinic receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in these cells have been well established (34Poronnik P. Cummins M.M. O'Mullane L.M. Cook D.I. Cell Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), little is known about the role of PMCA-mediated Ca2+ efflux in this pathway. The current study was undertaken to determine the functional relevance of the interactions between NHERF-2 and PMCA in the context of muscarinic receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling in HT-29 cells. Cell Culture, Transfection, and siRNA—The human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 (ATCC) was maintained in standard RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), 10% turbo calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells used in this study were between passages 20-40. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% turbo calf serum (Invitrogen), and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the experiments to silence NHERF-2, HT-29 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding siRNA directed against two different regions of NHERF-2 (Shag-274 and Shag-361) or control (Shag-FF). These plasmids have been shown previously to effectively suppress the endogenous levels of NHERF-2 (38Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S.

Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies 5F10 and JA9 (Affinity Bioreagents), have been previously characterized (40Kessler F. Bennardini F. Bachs O. Serratosa J. James P. Caride A.J. Gazzotti P.

Generation of the specific antibodies against NHERF-1 and -2 was previously described (27Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The monoclonal GFP antibody was from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). RNA Isolation and PCR—Total RNA was extracted from HT-29 cells using the TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA (100 ng) was reverse-transcribed using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with primers based on mouse NHERF-1 and -2 (39Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Ferguson C. Lee A. Wang D. Parton R.G.

Chem. 2006; 281: 16068-16077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). β-Actin was used as a housekeeping gene using commercially available primers (Promega). Samples without the reverse transcriptase were also run in parallel as a control. The PCR was run for 20 cycles at 94, 55, and 72 °C, 1 min each. RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Western Blotting—Flasks (75 cm2) of confluent HT-29 cells were washed three times in PBS at room temperature. Cells were according to experimental conditions first preincubated with 50 μm BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethylester, Invitrogen) for 30 min, then exposed to either acetylcholine (ACh, 10 μm) or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 5 μm). At the given time points, the flasks were immediately placed on ice and washed three times in ice-cold PBS. Cells were then exposed to Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.) (1.22 μg/ml) for 45 min at 4 °C. This was followed by a wash of 100 μm glycine in PBS at 4 °C for 5 min to quench excess biotin, followed by three more washes of cold PBS. Cells were solubilized in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Roche Applied Science), complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Protein quantification was done on the supernatants then equal amounts of lysate were mixed with immunopure streptavidin (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.) for 30 min with end-to-end rotation at 4 °C. Protein was eluted off the beads using 6× SDS loading dye and run on 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and stained with Ponceau-S to visually confirm equal loading of membrane fraction. Blots were then blocked for 1 h in 5% skim milk powder in Tris-NaCl-Tween buffer (TBS-T). Primary antibody was incubated overnight at 4 °C (5F10 1:2000, JA9 1:1000, and NHERF-1-2, 1:5000) in TBS-T. Blots were washed four times with TBS-T, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.) and washed again. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal kit (Pierce Biotechnology Inc). Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins—Full-length NHERF-1, NHERF-2, and individual domains of NHERF-2 (PDZ1, PDZ2, and COOH) cloned into pGEX4T-1 have been described previously (42Fouassier L. Yun C.C. Fitz J.G. Doctor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25039-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Stratagene). Optimal expression of fusion proteins was achieved by adding a final concentration of 2 mm isopropyl-ß-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the bacterial culture, with overnight incubation at 22 °C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS. After sonication, GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. GST Pull-downs—HT-29 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors) for 1 h at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C, and the supernatant collected. Lysates for the pull-down experiment investigating the Ca2+ dependence of PMCA-NHERF-2 interactions had an additional 100 μm BAPTA free acid. GST fusion proteins (10 μg) were bound to Sepharose in GST binding buffer (lysis buffer, + 5 mm dithiothreitol) for 3 h at 4 °C; the beads were washed three times in wash buffer (GST binding buffer, + 0.0075% SDS) and once in lysis buffer. The cell lysate (5-10 mg) was then incubated with GST fusion protein beads in lysis buffer at 4 °C overnight with gentle rotation. Bound proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer (no protease inhibitor) and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western-blotted and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation—HT-29 cell lysates were prepared following activation with 10 μm ACh 60 s. The supernatant was collected and incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h at 4 °C. Cleared cell lysate (3 mg) was incubated with NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Protein complexes were recovered using protein A-agarose beads for 4 h, and subsequent complexes recovered in SDS loading buffer. Samples were run on an 10% SDS-PAGE gel and Western blots performed using appropriate antibodies. In Vitro Binding Assay—The 130-amino acid C-terminal tail of PMCA1b and the tail minus the PDZ binding motif were cloned into pGFP-C1N (Clontech), using the BamH1/Sal1 site and were PCR-amplified using the following primers: PMCA1b fwd-gcgtcgacgagattgatcacgctgaaacc, PMCA1b: rev-cgcggatccttcagagtgatgtttcc, PMCA1b-PDZΔ: rev-ctggatccctcaaactatgtagtggg. PCR amplicons were ligated into pGFP-C1N to make the constructs GFP-PMCA1b-CT and GFP-PMCA1b-PDZΔ. Constructs were transfected into HEK cells and left for 48 h to allow optimal transgene expression. Cells were solubilized in GST lysis buffer (as described above). Using the same GST pull-down protocol as previously described, GST-NHERF-2 bound to Sepharose beads were incubated with the cell lysates produced. Complexes were recovered, run on a Western blot, and probed with the anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen). Measurement of Cytosolic [Ca2+]—[Ca2+]i measurements were performed using the fluorescent ratiometric Ca2+ dye Fura-2 (Fura-2 AM, Invitrogen). The efflux of free [Ca2+]i was determined using a fluorescence microplate reader to monitor the rate of decline in [Ca2+]i after the generation of ACh-evoked Ca2+ transients. Cells were seeded in tissue culture-treated black 96-well plates (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, VIC, Australia). Before experimentation, cells were washed twice in HEPES buffered salt solution (HBSS, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), and loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 in the same buffer for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. After loading, cells were washed three times in HBSS to remove excess dye. All experiments were performed in a BMG Fluostar Optima (BMG Lab Technologies, Offenburg, Germany) using 340 nm, 380 nm excitation, and 520 nm emission filters (BMG Lab Technologies). An automated injection of agonist was made at 20 s to give final well concentrations of ACh(10 μm) and CPA (5 μm). The ratio of the emission at 520 nm relative following 348/380 nm excitation represent the relative changes in [Ca2+]i. Relative PMCA-mediated Ca2+ efflux was assessed based on previously described methods (43Lee W.J. Robinson J.A. Holman N.A. McCall M.N. Roberts-Thomson S.J. Monteith G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27076-27084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For Ca2+ efflux measurements the HBSS buffer was removed, and cells were washed once with loading buffer and then twice with Na+/Ca2+-free HBSS in which Na+ was replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine and which contained 100 μm BAPTA-tetra-K+ salt (cell impermeant BAPTA, Sigma Aldrich). The solution in which the agonist was injected also contained 5 μm CPA to prevent Ca2+ reuptake by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). This Na+/Ca2+-free HBSS buffer also prevents any possible contribution of Na+/Ca2+ exchange. The rate of decline in [Ca2+]i measured under these conditions was predominately a measure of PMCA-mediated efflux of cytosolic Ca2+. In some experiments in which NHERF-2 was silenced, Ca2+ store release was determined without the inclusion of CPA in the agonist solution. The relative rate of recovery from the peak Ca2+ transient was measured by fitting the declining phase of the [Ca2+]i transient with a monoexponential curve over 30 s, commencing 20 s after the peak. Immunohistochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—HT-29 cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips. Cells were incubated in HBSS ± 10 μm ACh for 60 s, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were washed four times in PBS and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (3% normal horse serum, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Triton X-100). Cells were then washed two more times with PBS, then primary antibodies (pan-PMCA 1:1000 and NHERF-2 1:500) were applied in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed four times in PBS, and secondary antibody was applied (Alexa-Fluor 488 and 546, Invitrogen, 1:500) for 30 min. Cells were washed again four times in PBS and mounted onto glass slides using Prolong-Gold mounting medium (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 meta confocal microscope using a 488-nm argon and 543-nm HeNe laser (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Images were taken using Plan-Apochromat 63× and 100×, 1.4 oil immersion objectives. All images were captured and analyzed using Zeiss LSM image viewer. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was assessed using ANOVA with a Tukey-Neuman post-test. Data were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Unless otherwise specified, results are presented as mean ± S.E. Data from microplate assays are representative of 3-4 independent assays where each group was measured from 6-8 wells. NHERF/PMCA Interactions in HT-29 Cells—We have previously reported that HT-29 cells express only PMCA1 and PMCA4 isoforms (44Aung C.S. Kruger W.A. Poronnik P. Roberts-Thomson S.J. Monteith G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RT-PCR confirmed that the HT-29 cells used in this study expressed the mRNA for NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 (Fig. 1A). Western blotting also confirmed that HT-29 cells expressed readily detectable levels of both NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 protein (Fig. 1, B and C). It has been shown recently, using heterologous expression systems that the CNS isoform PMCA2b interacts with NHERF-2 (18DeMarco S.J. Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10506-10511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Importantly, PMCA1b has a Class 1 PDZ binding motif identical to that of PMCA2b (6Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). HT-29 cell lysates were incubated with GST fusion proteins of either full-length NHERF-1 or NHERF-2, the bound proteins were eluted, and then run on Western blots and probed with the 5F10 antibody. We found that NHERF-2 but not NHERF-1 interacted with PMCA (Fig. 2A). In parallel we performed these experiments using three GST fusion proteins that encoded the individual binding domains of NHERF-2; PDZ1, PDZ2, and the C-terminal ezrin binding domain. These data revealed that PMCA in HT-29 cells bound the PDZ2 module of NHERF-2 (Fig. 2A). GST pull-downs rely on an added excess of fusion proteins and can therefore unmask low affinity interactions. To confirm that the interaction between PMCA and NHERF-2 occurred in the presence of endogenous levels of each protein we also performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These experiments were also performed in the presence of ACh to determine whether the PMCA/NHERF-2 interaction was altered during muscarinic receptor activation. Cell lysates were prepared from cells treated ± ACh for 60 s, the lysates then incubated with anti-NHERF-1 or NHERF-2 antibodies, and the resultant complexes resolved by Western blotting. Under these conditions, NHERF-2, but not NHERF-1"
https://openalex.org/W2086364184,"Targeted therapy against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represents a major therapeutic advance in lung cancer treatment. Somatic mutations of the EGFR gene, most commonly L858R (exon 21) and short in-frame exon 19 deletions, have been found to confer enhanced sensitivity toward the inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. We have recently identified an EGFR mutation E884K, in combination with L858R, in a patient with advanced lung cancer who progressed on erlotinib maintenance therapy, and subsequently had leptomeningeal metastases that responded to gefitinib. The somatic E884K substitution appears to be relatively infrequent and resulted in a mutant lysine residue that disrupts an ion pair with residue R958 in the EGFR kinase domain C-lobe, an interaction that is highly conserved within the human kinome as demonstrated by our sequence analysis and structure analysis. Our studies here, using COS-7 transfection model system, show that E884K works in concert with L858R in-cis, in a dominant manner, to change downstream signaling, differentially induce Mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signaling-regulated kinase 1/2) signaling and associated cell proliferation and differentially alter sensitivity of EGFR phosphorylation inhibition by ERBB family inhibitors in an inhibitor-specific manner. Mutations of the conserved ion pair E884-R958 may result in conformational changes that alter kinase substrate recognition. The analogous E1271K-MET mutation conferred differential sensitivity toward preclinical MET inhibitors SU11274 (unchanged) and PHA665752 (more sensitive). Systematic bioinformatics analysis of the mutation catalog in the human kinome revealed the presence of cancer-associated mutations involving the conserved E884 homologous residue, and adjacent residues at the ion pair, in known proto-oncogenes (KIT, RET, MET and FAK) and tumor-suppressor gene (LKB1). Targeted therapy using small-molecule inhibitors should take into account potential cooperative effects of multiple kinase mutations, and their specific effects on downstream signaling and inhibitor sensitivity. Improved efficacy of targeted kinase inhibitors may be achieved by targeting the dominant activating mutations present."
https://openalex.org/W2007063639,"Positive selection for protein function can lead to multiple mutations within a small stretch of DNA, i.e., to a cluster of mutations. Recently, Wagner proposed a method to detect such mutation clusters. His method, however, did not take into account that residues with high solvent accessibility are inherently more variable than residues with low solvent accessibility. Here, we propose a new algorithm to detect clustered evolution. Our algorithm controls for different substitution probabilities at buried and exposed sites in the tertiary protein structure, and uses random permutations to calculate accurate P values for inferred clusters. We apply the algorithm to genomes of bacteria, fly, and mammals, and find several clusters of mutations in functionally important regions of proteins. Surprisingly, clustered evolution is a relatively rare phenomenon. Only between 2% and 10% of the genes we analyze contain a statistically significant mutation cluster. We also find that not controlling for solvent accessibility leads to an excess of clusters in terminal and solvent-exposed regions of proteins. Our algorithm provides a novel method to identify functionally relevant divergence between groups of species. Moreover, it could also be useful to detect artifacts in automatically assembled genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1987333943,"Background Mass mortalities of marine mammals due to infectious agents are increasingly reported. However, in contrast to previous die-offs, which were indiscriminate with respect to sex and age, here we report a land-based mass mortality of Subantarctic fur seals with apparent exclusivity to adult males. An infectious agent with a male-predilection is the most plausible explanation for this die-off. Although pathogens with gender-biased transmission and pathologies are unusual, rodents are known sources of male-biased infectious agents and the invasive Mus musculus house mouse, occurs in seal rookeries. Methodology/ Principal Findings Molecular screening for male-biased pathogens in this potential rodent reservoir host revealed the absence of Cardiovirus and Leptospirosis genomes in heart and kidney samples, respectively, but identified a novel Streptococcus species with 30% prevalence in mouse kidneys. Conclusions/ Significance Inter-species transmission through environmental contamination with this novel bacterium, whose congenerics display male-bias and have links to infirmity in seals and terrestrial mammals (including humans), highlights the need to further evaluate disease risks posed by alien invasive mice to native species, on this and other islands."
https://openalex.org/W2003674277,"Eukaryotic genomes are scattered with retroelements that proliferate through retrotransposition. Although retroelements make up around 40 percent of the human genome, large regions are found to be completely devoid of retroelements. This has been hypothesised to be a result of genomic regions being intolerant to insertions of retroelements. The inadvertent transcriptional activity of retroelements may affect neighbouring genes, which in turn could be detrimental to an organism. We speculate that such retroelement transcription, or transcriptional interference, is a contributing factor in generating and maintaining retroelement-free regions in the human genome.Based on the known transcriptional properties of retroelements, we expect long interspersed elements (LINEs) to be able to display a high degree of transcriptional interference. In contrast, we expect short interspersed elements (SINEs) to display very low levels of transcriptional interference. We find that genomic regions devoid of long interspersed elements (LINEs) are enriched for protein-coding genes, but that this is not the case for regions devoid of short interspersed elements (SINEs). This is expected if genes are subject to selection against transcriptional interference. We do not find microRNAs to be associated with genomic regions devoid of either SINEs or LINEs. We further observe an increased relative activity of genes overlapping LINE-free regions during early embryogenesis, where activity of LINEs has been identified previously.Our observations are consistent with the notion that selection against transcriptional interference has contributed to the maintenance and/or generation of retroelement-free regions in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2031271501,"Glycoprotein Ib α (GpIbα), a trans-membrane glycoprotein, is expressed on the surface of megakaryocytes and platelets, where, in association with glycoprotein Ib β, glycoprotein V, and glycoprotein IX, it normally forms the von Willebrand factor receptor (vWFR). A fully functional vWFR is necessary for platelet attachment, aggregation, and activation and has also been shown to regulate megakaryocyte ploidy. We have recently shown that the gene encoding GpIbα is a transcriptional target for the c-Myc oncoprotein and is more widely expressed than previously thought, with particularly high levels occurring in transformed cells. Indeed, GpIbα can substitute for c-Myc in promoting growth, transformation, and genomic instability. In the current work, we have demonstrated that, despite the promiscuous expression of GpIbα, other vWFR subunits remain largely restricted to megakaryocytes. We have characterized a panel of GpIbα mutants and shown that some regions of the protein essential for vWFR activity are not necessary for c-Myc-like functions. Specifically, the six C-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, which mediate vWFR signaling, are entirely dispensible for the c-Myc-like functions of GpIbα. Instead, these require a more membrane-proximal filamin-binding domain. Also important is the GpIbα signal peptide, which, in the absence of other vWFR subunits, directs GpIbα to the endoplasmic reticulum rather than the membrane.

GpIbα is initially synthesized as a 627-amino acid precursor, with a 610-amino acid membrane-bound mature form resulting from cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide. vWF is exposed on damaged vascular endothelium, which allows for the attachment, aggregation, and activation of vWFR-bearing platelets during the initial stages of hemostasis. In addition to its role in hemostasis, GpIbα also regulates bone marrow megakaryocyte ploidy and proliferation (4Feng S. Christodoulides N. Kroll M.H.

Recently, we showed that GpIbα is more widely expressed than previously appreciated and participates in aspects of c-Myc oncoprotein function that are unrelated to and independent of its role in platelet physiology. Specifically, we showed that the GPIBA gene is a direct downstream target for c-Myc and that GpIbα is both necessary and sufficient to promote the genomic instability (GI) that typically accompanies c-Myc deregulation (11Yin X.Y.

Li Y. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, cancer cell lines that overexpress c-Myc tend to have extremely high levels of GpIbα, whereas untransformed cells or primary cells tend to have extremely low or undetectable levels (15Li Y.

Taken together, these unanticipated oncoprotein-like aspects of GpIbα indicate that it plays an integral role in mediating a number of distinct c-Myc phenotypes. These unexpected properties of GpIbα raise a number of important questions. For example, which regions of the molecule are necessary for these multiple behaviors, and are they genetically separable? How do these regions relate to those that execute the traditional vWFR-dependent functions of GpIbα? Finally, if GpIbα is expressed more widely than previously realized, are GpIbβ, GpV, and GpIX also similarly expressed, and, if so, is their association with GpIbα required for its oncoprotein-like properties? In the current work, we have investigated these and other questions pertaining to the means by which GpIbα exerts its oncoprotein-like functions. Our findings provide evidence that cells other than megakaryocytes do not coordinately express all vWFR subunits, that GpIbα need not be expressed at the cell surface in order for it to carry out its c-Myc-like functions, that certain of these functions are genetically separable, and that these regions may be quite different from those that mediate vWFR functions. Our results also imply that, in nonmegakaryocytic cells, GpIbα plays roles that are distinct from those related to hemostatasis.

Monolayers were then washed three times in serum-free medium and maintained in serum-free medium for the remainder of the experiment. Viable cell counts using trypan blue exclusion were then performed at regular intervals in triplicate. Immunoblotting and Subcellular Fractionation—Immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) (13Rogulski K.R. Cohen D.E. Corcoran D.L. Benos P.V. Prochownik E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18968-18973Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Antibodies consisted of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the c-Myc epitope tag present on the C termini of all GpIbα constructs (clone 9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), a mAb directed against β-tubulin (clone D10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against calnexin (SPA-860; StressGen Biotechnologies, San Diego CA). A murine mAb against human GpIbα antibody (WM23) was a generous gift from Dr. Michael Berndt). Membranes were blocked for at least 1 h in PBS, 0.15% Tween (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by the addition of primary antibodies at the dilutions recommended by the supplier. Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation, followed by extensive washing in PBS-T. The membranes were then incubated with 1:20,000 dilutions of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (sc-2005; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2313; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature in PBS-T-milk followed by repeated washing. Membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate; Pierce). Isolation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was performed with a Sigma endoplasmic reticulum isolation kit (catalog number ER0100 –1KT) according to the directions of the supplier. Fluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were trypsinized and seeded into 12-well plates containing 18-mm glass coverslips (VWR, Inc., West Chester, PA). 1–2 days later, coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed at room temperature for 10 min with freshly prepared 4% paraform-aldehyde-PBS. After washing an additional 2–3 times with PBS, coverslips were either used immediately or stored in PBS for no longer than 24 h. Immunostaining was performed with the above described anti-c-Myc epitope tag mAb, with the above described WM23 anti-GpIbα mAb, with another GpIbα mAb (LJ-Ibα1 mAb; gift of Dr. Zaverio Ruggieri), or with an anti-γ-H2AX mAb (JBW301; Upstate, Temacula, CA). Secondary antibodies consisted of AlexaFluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse and rabbit IgGs (1:1500 dilution) (Invitrogen). To show the lack of localization of GpIbα to the surface, Rat1a cells expressing various forms of the protein were stained with the LJ-IBα1 mouse anti-GpIbα mAb. Secondary staining was with AlexaFluor 610-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. The cells were also stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the transforming growth factor-β2 receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and secondarily stained with AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG. Final nuclear staining was with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with an Olympus Provis fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Inc., Center Valley, PA), as described previously (13Rogulski K.R. Cohen D.E. Corcoran D.L. Benos P.V.

Confocal images were taken with an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope, and Adobe Photoshop CS2 (version 9.0) was employed for image analysis. Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated as described previously (14Li Y. Lu J. Prochownik E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3490-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Yin X. Grove L. Rogulski K. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol.

We used the Primer 3 program (available on the World Wide Web) to select optimal primers for the coding regions of the human mRNAs for GpIbα (GenBank™ accession number NM_000173), GpIbβ (NM_000407), GpV (L11238), and GpIX (NM_000174). Specific primers and their predicted products are listed in Table S1. Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). For each qRT-PCR reaction, we used 50 ng of total input RNA in a SYBR Green-based assay (Quantitect; Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) according to the directions of the supplier. Reactions were performed in triplicate on a Roche LightCycler 2 (Roche Applied Science) using the conditions recommended by the supplier. All analyses used LightCycler Relative Quantification Software 4. S.E. values on all samples were <2%. Cτ values for each reaction were normalized to those for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reactions that were included in parallel for each set of qRT-PCR runs (13Rogulski K.R. Cohen D.E.

The specificity of all primer sets was confirmed by electrophoresis of select amplified DNAs on 4% NuSieve-GTG low melt agarose gels (Cambrex Biosciences, Inc., Rockland, ME) in order to demonstrate the presence of a single amplified fragment of the predicted size (not shown). Generation and Expression of Gp1bα Deletion Mutants—Most GpIbα deletion mutants were generated using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT, Inc. and were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sequences of mutagenic primers are shown in Table S2. The starting template in all cases consisted of the pLXSN-EYFP vector containing the wild-type Gp1bα coding region tagged at its C terminus with a c-Myc epitope (14Li Y. Lu J. Prochownik E.V. Proc.

Plasmid DNAs were transfected into Phoenix A cells using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) (24Rothermund K. Rogulski K. Fernandes E. Whiting A. Sedivy J. Pu L. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2097-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Viral supernatants were harvested 48–72 h later and used to infect recipient cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Sequabrene (Sigma). Stable transfectants were then isolated by cell sorting (24Rothermund K. Rogulski K. Fernandes E. Whiting A. Sedivy J. Pu L. Prochownik E.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2097-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), pooled, and expanded for all further studies. Widespread Expression of Endogenous GpIbα Occurs in the Absence of Other vWFR Subunits—We previously reported that GpIbα is expressed to varying degrees by many established and primary cells (14Li Y. Lu J. Prochownik E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3490-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Li Y. Lu J. Cohen D. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2007; 27: 1599-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Elevated levels are seen in c-Myc-overexpressing cancer cell lines, particularly those with rearranged or amplified CMYC genes, such as Burkitt's lymphoma and HL60 promyelocytic leukemia (16Prochownik E.V. Li Y. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4016) Google Scholar). However, the status of other vWFR subunits was not determined in those studies. To investigate this in more detail, we quantified transcript levels for GpIbα and each of the other three vWFR subunits in several nontransformed and transformed human cell lines and primary cell strains using qRT-PCR. As positive controls, we utilized the human megakaryoblastic cell line Mo7e, which expresses a functional vWFR (25Miyazawa K. Nishimaki J. Katagiri T. Yaguchi M. Iwase O. Gotoh A. Tauchi T.

U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3490-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The latter cells express high levels of GpIbα, as determined by immunoblotting (16Prochownik E.V. Li Y. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1, transcripts for GpIbα, GpIbβ, GpV, and GpIX were readily detected in Mo7e cells. In contrast BJ/TTR-GpIbα cells, although expressing GpIbα transcripts at levels 3-fold higher than those expressed by Mo7e cells, expressed barely detectable levels of GpIbβ, GpV, and GpIX transcripts. All other cell types tested expressed GpIbα transcripts at levels 20–50% of those measured in Mo7e cells but in most cases failed to express significant levels of GpIbβ, GpV, or GpIX transcripts. The only exception to this was seen in HL60 myeloid leukemia cells, which expressed low levels of all four transcripts. Although normal human diploid fibroblasts also expressed low levels of GpV and even lower levels of GpIbβ, they did not express significant levels of GpIX. These studies confirm our own earlier findings and those of others that GpIbα expression occurs in variety of cell types (14Li Y. Lu J. Prochownik E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They further show that, in most cases, this occurs independently of any significant or coordinated up-regulation of the other three vWFR subunit transcripts. Expression of GpIbα Mutants—The paucity of transcripts for vWFR subunits other than GpIbα in most cell types (Fig. 1) suggested that the previously reported effects of GpIbα on transformation, proliferation, and genomic integrity (14Li Y. Lu J. Prochownik E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3490-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Li Y. Lu J. Cohen D. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2007; 27: 1599-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were independent of its role in hemostasis. At the same time, it raised the question of how GpIbα performs these nontraditional functions and which regions of the molecule are involved. To address these issues, we generated a series of Myc epitope-tagged GpIbα mutants in the same retroviral backbone previously used to express the full-length protein (14Li Y. Lu J. Prochownik E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3490-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Li Y. Lu J. Cohen D. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 2007; 27: 1599-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These mutants consisted primarily of deletions in regions of the molecule involved in acknowledged vWFR-related functions (Fig. 2A and Table S3). For example, we generated mutants to test the need for GpIbα trafficking to the ER and cell surface (Del. Sig.), for vWF binding (Del.(25–75) and Del. LRR/vWF(75–210)), and for two distinct intracellular domains involved in 14-3-3ζ binding and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulation (Del.(620–627)) and filamin binding (Del. Fil.(540–590)) in response to engagement of the receptor by vWF (5Wu Y. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Yatomi Y. Takafuta T. Berndt M.C. Ozaki Y.

Polym.) removed a 13-amino acid polymorphic region between residues Glu-396 and Thr-411 that is repeated up to three times in certain GpIbα alleles (31Lopez J.A. Ludwig E.H. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10055-10061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region has been proposed to be a site of O-glycosylation that can affect the susceptibility of platelets to shear-induced activation (31Lopez J.A. Ludwig E.H. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10055-10061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a double point mutation (C384S/C385S) was generated to determine the consequences of abrogating the ability of GpIbα to be expressed on the cell surface in association with GpIbβ (3Luo S.Z. Mo X. Afshar-Kharghan V. Srinivasan S. Lopez J.A. Li R. Blood. 2007; 109: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The above GpIbα mutants were stably expressed in Rat1a fibroblasts. As seen in Fig. 2B, most GpIbα proteins were expressed at similar levels. However, the wild-type protein, along with small deletion mutations or point mutations, migrated substantially faster (apparent molecular mass ∼115–120 kDa) than did endogenous GpIbα from the megakaryocytic cell line Mo7e (apparent molecular mass ∼135–140 kDa) (9Feng S.

Sig.(567–627), also migrated faster than predicted and/or were expressed at lower levels than the wild-type protein. Discrepancies in apparent molecular mass values probably reflect the failure to properly glycosylate the mature protein as a result of an impaired ability to traverse the ER → Golgi → cell surface pathway when other vWFR subunits are absent (9Feng S.

https://openalex.org/W1966641833,"Background Four and a half LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) has been implicated in multiple signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and tissue homeostasis. We reported previously that FHL2 regulates cyclin D1 expression and that immortalized FHL2-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) display reduced levels of cyclin D1 and low proliferative activity. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we address the contribution of FHL2 in cell transformation by investigating the effects of oncogenic Ras in FHL2-null context. We show that H-RasV12 provokes cell cycle arrest accompanied by accumulation of p53 and p16INK4a in immortalized FHL2−/− MEFs. These features contrast sharply with Ras transforming activity in wild type cell lines. We further show that establishment of FHL2-null cell lines differs from conventional immortalization scheme by retaining functional p19ARF/p53 checkpoint that is required for cell cycle arrest imposed by Ras. However, after serial passages of Ras-expressing FHL2−/− cells, dramatic increase in the levels of D-type cyclins and Rb phosphorylation correlates with the onset of cell proliferation and transformation without disrupting the p19ARF/p53 pathway. Interestingly, primary FHL2-null cells overexpressing cyclin D1 undergo a classical immortalization process leading to loss of the p19ARF/p53 checkpoint and susceptibility to Ras transformation. Conclusions/Significance Our findings uncover a novel aspect of cellular responses to mitogenic stimulation and illustrate a critical role of FHL2 in the signalling network that implicates Ras, cyclin D1 and p53."

Pulse radiolytically produced CO2− radical ions were found to reduce the disulfide bridges to yield disulfide radicals, RSS*R–. Rates and absorption changes due to formation or decay of RSS*R– and the flavin quinone, semiquinone, and hydroquinone were measured and analyzed. During the first 100 μs following the pulse, the flavin was reduced to the semiquinone by intramolecular electron transfer from the active site disulfide radical. The semiquinone and the remaining disulfide radicals then reacted by much slower, 40 ms to 40 s, inter-homodimer electron transfer reactions, culminating in reduced flavin and dithiols. The dithiols were then subject to oxidation by enzyme molecules via their intrinsic enzymatic activity, at a rate comparable to the slower intermolecular processes in the 10-s time regime. Mutants of AtErv1 lacking each of the three individual cysteine pairs were studied to determine the involvement of the respective disulfide groups in these reactions. Elimination of the active site disulfide bridge increased the stability of the flavin semiquinone making it a long-lived product. Relevance of these observations to the design and function of the sulfhydryl oxidases is discussed.

Herrmann J.M. Cell.. 2005; 121: 1059-1069Google Scholar). A Mia40 homolog exists in A. thaliana, suggesting that an orthologous oxidative pathway operates in the plant mitochondrial IMS. AtErv1 is a homodimer, in which each subunit has three disulfides. The proposed catalytic mechanism of AtErv1 assumes the two-electron uptake from protein substrates by the “shuttle” disulfide (Cys-177/Cys-182) present on the flexible C-terminal tail (21Vitu E. Bentzur M. Lisowsky T. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. J. Mol. Biol.. 2006; 362: 89-101Google Scholar), followed by transfer of the electrons to the active site disulfide (Cys-119/Cys-122) and further to the FAD. The flavin then reduces dioxygen (21Vitu E. Bentzur M. Lisowsky T. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. J. Mol. Biol.. 2006; 362: 89-101Google Scholar) to hydrogen peroxide, or cytochrome c [Fe(III)] to cytochrome c [Fe(II)]. 4D. Fass, O. Farver, and S. Wherland, unpublished data. 4D. Fass, O. Farver, and S. Wherland, unpublished data. The third disulfide present in this enzyme (Cys-148/Cys-165) plays a structural role and does not participate in its electron transfer activity. Flavoproteins can form the necessary interface between two-electron donors and single-electron acceptors (or vice versa), or between two-electron donors and two-electron acceptors, through modulation of the relative stability and reactivity of the quinone, semiquinone, and hydroquinone states of the flavin. In the present study, we have employed the pulse radiolysis method to resolve individual electron transfer (ET) steps potentially related to the catalytic cycle of AtErv1. By this technique, reducing or oxidizing species are produced in the reactant solution by very short pulses (∼1 μs) of high-energy (5 MeV) electromagnetic radiation. The ensuing electron transfer reactions are then monitored by absorption spectrometry. In addition to the advantageous time resolution of this method, it enables production of reagents with a wide range of reduction potentials (22Farver O. Pecht I. Prog. Inorg. Chem.. 2007; 55: 1-78Google Scholar). A disulfide bridge has been used previously as an entry port for pulse radiolytically produced reduction equivalents in studies of electron transfer through proteins including azurin (23Farver O. Pecht I. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 1992; 114: 5764-5767Google Scholar) and ceruloplasmin (24Farver O. Bendahl L. Skov L.K. Pecht I. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 26135-26140Google Scholar). An elegant example of thorough analysis by pulse radiolysis of a flavin-containing enzyme is the work of Hille on xanthine oxidase (25Hille R. Anderson R.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1991; 266: 5608-5615Google Scholar). The present study illustrates the applicability of the method to proteins containing multiple disulfides, both structural and redox active. As strong, one-electron donors, the disulfide radicals produced by pulse radiolysis may be non-physiological compared with dithiols that donate two electrons, but they necessarily produce the semiquinone state of the flavin. The semiquinone would also be formed when a one-electron acceptor, cytochrome c [Fe(III)] (known as a physiological oxidant), reacts with the fully reduced flavin. A variety of opportunities for intra- and intermolecular ET exist between disulfide radicals and the flavins in the AtErv1 dimer, between the disulfide radicals themselves, and between different reduction states of the flavins, as well as with dithiols that are produced by the pulses. The pulse radiolysis method enables determination of the rates of these processes, thereby providing insights into the reactivities of the available sites. The amplitudes of the absorbance changes provide the amounts of the species that are formed and hence also their relative stabilities. Results of the present studies yielded insights into possible inter- and intramolecular electron transfer processes that take place during the reductive half-cycle of this enzyme. Site-directed mutants were generated using the Quikchange kit (Stratagene). Sequences of mutagenic oligonucleotides can be provided upon request. The AtErv1 coding region was fully sequenced for all mutants. AtErv1 and its mutants were expressed and purified as described for enzymatic assays (21Vitu E. Bentzur M. Lisowsky T. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. J. Mol. Biol.. 2006; 362: 89-101Google Scholar) and then dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 200 mm sodium formate. All experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions between 9 and 13 °C at pH 7.0 in nitrous oxide-saturated solutions containing 200 mm formate and 10 mm phosphate. AtErv1 dimer concentrations were in the range from 2.5 to 6 μm. All protein concentrations and respective rate constants are reported as protomer concentrations. Pulse widths of 0.75–1.0 μs were used. Under these conditions, pulse widths of 1.0 μs produce ∼15 μmCO2− radicals, as determined by independent dosimetry measurements. Experiments were done using a 1-cm Spectrosil® cuvette, using either one or three light passes, which result in an overall optical path-length of either 1 or 3 cm. The analyzing light beam was produced with a 150-watt xenon lamp together with a Bausch & Lomb double grating monochromator. Appropriate optical filters with cut-off at 285 or 385 nm were used to reduce photochemical and light scattering effects. The data acquisition system consisted of a Tektronix 390 A/D transient recorder attached to a PC. The temperature of the reaction solutions in the cuvette was controlled by a thermostating system and continuously monitored by a thermistor attached to the cuvette. Reactions were generally performed under pseudo-first order conditions, with typically a 10-fold excess of protein's redox-sites over reducing radicals. In each experiment 2,000 data points were collected, divided equally between two different time scales. Usually the processes were recorded over at least three half-lives. Each kinetic run was repeated at least four times. The data were analyzed by fitting to a sum of exponentials using a non-linear least squares program written in MATLAB®. The main primary products of interaction of high-energy electromagnetic radiation with aqueous solutions are hydrated electrons (e–aq) and OH radicals. These are rather nonselective agents, but they can be converted to milder, more specific ones such as CO2− radicals in N2O-saturated aqueous solutions containing formate ions by the following reaction sequence in Reaction. eaq−+N2O+H2O→OH+OH−+N2Reaction Scheme 1 OH+HCO2−→CO2−+H2O In dilute protein solutions, the CO2− radicals will either react with thermodynamically and sterically accessible redox centers, or decay by dimerization to form oxalate, and the reactions can be followed spectrophotometrically.

Open table in a new tab Wild type (WT) AtErv1—Each subunit of WT AtErv1 contains four potential redox centers: an FAD and three disulfide bridges. The FAD-proximal, active site disulfide is 3.4 Å (cysteine sulfur to isoalloxazine C4) from the FAD. The distal, shuttle disulfide is on a flexible polypeptide segment that could not be resolved in electron density maps obtained from x-ray crystallography of AtErv1 (21Vitu E. Bentzur M. Lisowsky T. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. J. Mol. Biol.. 2006; 362: 89-101Google Scholar). This segment of the enzyme may access conformations that place the shuttle disulfide anywhere between van der Waals contact and ∼30 Å from the active site disulfide of the second subunit of the dimer, as estimated from the extensibility of the polypeptide chain. The third, structural disulfide is found ∼15 Å from the active site disulfide and the FAD isoalloxazine (Fig. 1). When an anaerobic, N2O-saturated, 10 μm (protomer) solution of WT AtErv1 was subjected to CO2− radical ions, a fast absorption increase was monitored at 340 nm (Fig. 2A) with a protein concentration-dependent rate constant of (5.7 ± 1.0)·104 s–1. This process was studied over a protomer concentration range from 4.8 to 11.5 μm (see Fig. 3) yielding a second order rate constant of (5.8 ± 0.5)·109m–1 s–1 at 10.2 °C, i.e. an essentially diffusion controlled process. From the spectroscopic properties of all potential redox centers (Table 1), it is seen that the FAD has an isosbestic point at 340 nm, whereas the disulfide radical anion, RSS*R– has an extinction coefficient of 5,000 m–1 cm–1 at this wavelength. Hence, the observed absorption changes suggest Reaction 2. CO2−+RSSR→CO2+RSS*R−Reaction 2 However, the concomitant decay of CO2− causes an absorption decrease at this wavelength (ϵ340 = –1,400 m–1 cm–1). Disappearance of ∼15 μmCO2− radicals produced in a single, 1 μs, pulse would result in an absorption decrease of ∼0.021 cm–1. Hence, the observed amplitude of this process corresponds to a reduction yield of ∼5.5 μm disulfide radicals per pulse. On slower time scales, the 340-nm absorption decayed in two phases, the first with a rate constant of 290 ± 50 s–1 at a protein concentration of 10 μm. Since no similar process was observed at wavelengths characteristic of the FAD, this phase probably reflects a dismutation reaction between two different disulfide radicals, (2 RSS*R– → 2RS– + RSSR). The cause of the apparent first-order kinetics is discussed below. The slower phase of absorption amplitude decay decreases back to zero with rate constants 2.1 ± 0.8 s–1. This phase is apparently due to a fraction of the disulfide radicals that is sufficiently protected to prohibit the faster intermolecular ET and either dismutates or reacts with FAD semiquinone (SQ) at this slower rate (see below). Observed rate constants and sign of absorbance changes for the different reactions monitored in WT and AtErv1 mutants are presented in Table 2 below.FIGURE 3Observed rate constants of the initial formation of disulfide radical ions in WT AtErv1 as a function of protomer protein concentration, monitored at 340 nm and 10.2 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 2Observed rate constants and sign of absorbance changes for the different reactions monitored in WT and mutant AtErv1WavelengthFast.time scale (100-400 μs)Int. time scale (10-40 ms)Slow time scale (1-40 s)kfast/s-1Ampkint/s-1Ampkslow/s-1Ampnm1.

The observed rate constant of (2.0 ± 0.5)·104 s–1 was also protein concentration-dependent and similar to that of RSS*R– formation. SQ formation may be due to either direct reduction by CO2− radicals or reduction mediated by the active site disulfide. Considering the proximity of these two redox centers, the latter process is expected to take place in a very fast time domain that cannot be resolved by our technique. The reduction yield of this phase was calculated to be ∼3.3 μm per pulse, i.e. the ratio between RSS*R– and FAD SQ produced was ∼1.7. The 580-nm absorption decayed with an observed rate constant of 3.0 ± 1.0 s–1. Thus, FAD SQ is relatively unstable in this enzyme and may either dismutate intermolecularly (SQ + SQ → Q + HQ) (Δϵ580 = –3,300 m–1 cm–1) or be reduced further by an RSS*R– radical in another dimer. However, the former process should give rise to a net absorption increase at 453 nm, which is not observed (vide infra). Therefore, the process is likely to be reduction of the SQ by RSS*R–. A fast absorption increase was also observed at 453 nm (Fig. 2C), with a rate constant similar to those observed at 340 nm and 580 nm (Table 2). The rates of these fast phases are protein concentration-dependent and thus reflect bimolecular events (i.e. between two enzyme homodimers). As both disulfide radicals and FAD absorb at 453 nm, the observed absorption changes have composite contributions: FAD reduction to SQ causes an absorption decrease (Δϵ453 = –6,100 m–1 cm–1), whereas the disulfide radical formation exhibits an absorption increase with a similar extinction value (Δϵ453 = +6,200 m–1 cm–1). The observed net absorption increase at 453 nm indicates that more disulfide bridges than FAD molecules were reduced. Assuming that the absorption increase at 453 nm is due to partitioning of reduction equivalents between FAD and disulfides, this conclusion agrees with the above calculations based on the absorption changes observed for disulfide radical formation at 340 nm and SQ formation at 580 nm. The same slow absorption decay observed at 340 nm and 580 nm was also observed at 453 nm with a rate constant 2.7 ± 0.3 s–1, in accordance with the concomitant slow decay of both disulfide radicals and SQ (Δϵ453 = –9,600 m–1 cm–1). One important question pertinent to the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme is identification of the disulfide bridges that are reduced as a result of these initial pulses. Disulfide radicals and SQ were formed at the same, diffusion-controlled rate, so information about how many disulfides are reduced can be derived from the relative amplitudes of this phase monitored at different wavelengths. If all three disulfides and FAD are reduced indiscriminately by CO2−, and the latter is immediately reduced via the active site disulfide radical, we would expect a ratio of 1.0 between the initial yields of RSS*R– and SQ, which is not in agreement with the observed net absorption increase at 453 nm. As stated above, we assume that the active site FAD-disulfide complex acts as a single electron accepting site when reduced by CO2−, rapidly forming SQ. If the other two disulfide groups are reduced with equal probability, we would expect a ratio between reduced disulfides and FAD of ∼2:1. This ratio is indeed in good agreement with the calculated average ratio of 1.7 ± 0.2 obtained from analysis of all our data collected for the WT enzyme over the time regime of ∼10 s after the pulse. Each enzyme solution was exposed to a series of pulses to monitor possible changes in reactivity caused by the increased extent of protein reduction. Under the anaerobic conditions employed, 10 μm AtErv1 may, in principle, take up 80 μm reduction equivalents. Static spectra of the enzyme solutions were routinely measured before, between pulses, and after each set of experiments. Fig. 4 demonstrates that 7.8 μm out of 10 μm FAD were reduced as a result of exposure to thirteen pulses (1.0 μs each, total equivalent to ∼195 μmCO2−), based on calculations using absorbance changes monitored at 453 nm (Δϵ453 = –9,500 m–1 cm–1). The presence of the SQ form of FAD could not be detected in the static WT spectra, suggesting that this form has limited stability. To distinguish between the reactivities of the three different disulfide groups present in AtErv1, comprehensive experiments were next performed on mutants where one cystine at a time was replaced by redox inactive amino acid residues. The cysteines participating in the active site and shuttle disulfides were replaced by alanines, and those of the structural disulfide with a valine and a leucine. Results of pulse radiolysis experiments using these three mutants are presented in the following sections. Mutant Missing the Structural Disulfide—Upon reaction with CO2− radicals, solutions of this mutant also exhibited the fast increase in 340-nm absorption, a change assigned to disulfide radical ion formation (Table 2). The observed rate constants for this bimolecular reaction decreased with the number of reduction equivalents introduced, as observed for other AtErv1 variants. However, the 340-nm absorption decay amplitude was very small and seen only in the slow time window (kobs 4 ± 1 s–1), indicating that the disulfide radical dismutation, occurring on a millisecond time range in the WT enzyme, did not take place in this mutant. This observation suggests that the structural disulfide, when present, may be involved in the faster phase of disulfide dismutation. An absorption increase was monitored at 580 nm, reflecting SQ formation, on the same time scale as the fast absorption decay monitored at 340 nm. The observed rate constant of (0.61 ± 0.03)·104 s–1 is lower than the other AtErv1 variants. Still, the amplitudes are comparable, ∼0.01 cm–1. The absorption at 580 nm decreased to zero, but with a much lower rate constant (0.03 ± 0.02 s–1) than that observed for WT. In contrast to the other AtErv1 variants (see also below), a fast absorption decay was monitored at 453 nm with observed rate constant (0.9 ± 0.4)·104 s–1. Because the only processes occurring at this fast rate are disulfide and FAD reduction by CO2− (see Table 2), SQ formation must be dominant, possibly due to greater FAD exposure. A slow 453-nm absorption decrease with a rate constant 4 ± 1 s–1 is also monitored in this mutant, reflecting RSS*R– decay, in accordance with the observations at 340 nm. Finally, on a 10-s time scale, an absorption increase was observed with a concentration-dependent rate constant, which could reflect intermolecular dismutation of the SQ (Δϵ453 = +2,700 m–1 cm–1), in accordance with the absorption change monitored at 580 nm. The ratio of disulfide to FAD reduction yield is 1.2 ± 0.2, i.e. lower here than for WT and the mutant missing the active site disulfide, and comparable or slightly lower than the mutant missing the shuttle disulfide, both discussed below. Mutant Missing the Active Site Disulfide—This variant also exhibited a fast increase in absorption at 340 nm upon reaction with CO2−. The concentration-dependent observed rate constant (Table 2) implies a second order rate constant of ∼2·109m–1 s–1, again close to the diffusion controlled limit. Thus, in the presence or absence of the active site disulfide, the remaining disulfide groups exhibit similar reactivity toward the pulse-generated radicals. As in the WT enzyme, the 340-nm absorption decreased, although not completely, on an intermediate time scale (rate constant 150 ± 60 s–1) and with an amplitude of ∼0.005 cm–1. At 580 nm, an absorption increase with a rate constant of 2.3 ± 1.0·104 s–1 was observed, indicating formation of the FAD SQ at a rate similar to the above 340-nm absorption increase. Such a fast process in the mutant missing the FAD-proximal, active site disulfide suggests that the flavin was reduced directly by the CO2− radicals. From the absorption increase, we calculate a yield for SQ formation of 2.0 ± 0.2 μm. Unique to this mutant among the AtErv1 variants studied is the observation that the absorption at 580 nm, caused by the SQ formation, does not decay completely even on the longest time scale examined (minutes), suggesting that the SQ is stabilized by this mutation. This conclusion is further supported by static spectra of the ensuing solutions showing that the 580 nm band is observed for at least 10 min after the pulse. In contrast to all other enzyme variants studied here, no absorption changes were observed at either wavelength on the slow time scale (1–10 s) in the mutant lacking the active site disulfide. Finally, as for WT AtErv1, a net increase was observed in absorption at 453 nm following the pulse, again indicating that more disulfides than FAD were reduced. This absorption decayed at the same rate as that observed for the intermediate processes monitored at both 340 and 580 nm, and the ratio between reduced disulfides and FAD was found to be 2.5 ± 0.2. A ratio of 2.0 is expected for an equal probability of reducing any of the three redox centers. Mutant Missing the Shuttle Disulfide—In the absence of the shuttle disulfide, the fast formation of RSS*R– radicals was again observed at 340 nm with a second order rate constant of ∼4·109m–1 s–1 (Table 2). As for the structural disulfide mutant, no intermediate phase of radical disappearance in the millisecond time range was observed. Instead, the RSS*R– decayed in a much slower pseudo-first order process (Table 2). The direct reduction of FAD to the SQ form monitored at 580 nm (kobs = (1.8 ± 0.8)·104 s–1) was 2-fold slower than the disulfide radical formation, and the SQ radicals decayed with a rate constant of 2 ± 1 s–1, i.e. concomitant with the disulfide radical. At 453 nm, a fast absorption increase was observed (Table 2), with amplitudes indicating that the yield of RSS*R– was higher than that of reduced FAD. The ratio between disulfide reduction and SQ formation was calculated to be 1.4 ± 0.2. The 453-nm band decayed below zero with a rate constant of 6 ± 2 s–1, and this negative amplitude suggests that the disulfide radical oxidation proceeds concomitantly with FAD or SQ reduction. From the static spectrum, we calculated that ∼9.3 μm FAD was reduced to HQ out of the initial 11.2 μm protein concentration in 15 pulses"
