https://openalex.org/W2584033231,"The genetic dependencies of human cancers widely vary. Here, we catalog this heterogeneity and use it to identify functional gene interactions and genotype-dependent liabilities in cancer. By using genome-wide CRISPR-based screens, we generate a gene essentiality dataset across 14 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Sets of genes with correlated patterns of essentiality across the lines reveal new gene relationships, the essential substrates of enzymes, and the molecular functions of uncharacterized proteins. Comparisons of differentially essential genes between Ras-dependent and -independent lines uncover synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic Ras. Screens in both human AML and engineered mouse pro-B cells converge on a surprisingly small number of genes in the Ras processing and MAPK pathways and pinpoint PREX1 as an AML-specific activator of MAPK signaling. Our findings suggest general strategies for defining mammalian gene networks and synthetic lethal interactions by exploiting the natural genetic and epigenetic diversity of human cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2586263334,"Considerable evidences have shown that autophagy has an important role in tumor chemoresistance. However, it is still unknown whether the lncRNA HULC (highly upregulated in liver cancer) is involved in autophagy and chemoresistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we for the first time demonstrated that treatment with antitumor reagents such as oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin (THP) dramatically induced HULC expression and protective autophagy. Silencing of HULC sensitized HCC cells to the three antitumor reagents via inhibiting protective autophagy. Ectopic expression of HULC elicited the autophagy of HCC cells through stabilizing silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) protein. The investigation for the corresponding mechanism by which HULC stabilized Sirt1 revealed that HULC upregulated ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22), leading to the decrease of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Sirt1 protein by removing the conjugated polyubiquitin chains from Sirt1. Moreover, we found that miR-6825-5p, miR-6845-5p and miR-6886-3p could decrease the level of USP22 protein by binding to the 3′-untranlated region of USP22 mRNA. All the three microRNAs (miRNAs) were downregulated by HULC, which resulted in the elevation of USP22. In addition, we showed that the level of HULC was positively correlated with that of Sirt1 protein in human HCC tissues. Collectively, our data reveals that the pathway ‘HULC/USP22/Sirt1/ protective autophagy’ attenuates the sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that this pathway may be a novel target for developing sensitizing strategy to HCC chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2583553931,"Pain thresholds are, in part, set as a function of emotional and internal states by descending modulation of nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord. Neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) are thought to critically contribute to this process; however, the neural circuits and synaptic mechanisms by which distinct populations of RVM neurons facilitate or diminish pain remain elusive. Here we used in vivo opto/chemogenetic manipulations and trans-synaptic tracing of genetically identified dorsal horn and RVM neurons to uncover an RVM-spinal cord-primary afferent circuit controlling pain thresholds. Unexpectedly, we found that RVM GABAergic neurons facilitate mechanical pain by inhibiting dorsal horn enkephalinergic/GABAergic interneurons. We further demonstrate that these interneurons gate sensory inputs and control pain through temporally coordinated enkephalin- and GABA-mediated presynaptic inhibition of somatosensory neurons. Our results uncover a descending disynaptic inhibitory circuit that facilitates mechanical pain, is engaged during stress, and could be targeted to establish higher pain thresholds. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2586573214,"Gene therapy in the inner ear achieves unprecedented recovery of hearing and balance behavior in Usher syndrome mice. Because there are currently no biological treatments for hearing loss, we sought to advance gene therapy approaches to treat genetic deafness. We focused on Usher syndrome, a devastating genetic disorder that causes blindness, balance disorders and profound deafness, and studied a knock-in mouse model, Ush1c c.216G>A, for Usher syndrome type IC (USH1C). As restoration of complex auditory and balance function is likely to require gene delivery systems that target auditory and vestibular sensory cells with high efficiency, we delivered wild-type Ush1c into the inner ear of Ush1c c.216G>A mice using a synthetic adeno-associated viral vector, Anc80L65, shown to transduce 80–90% of sensory hair cells. We demonstrate recovery of gene and protein expression, restoration of sensory cell function, rescue of complex auditory function and recovery of hearing and balance behavior to near wild-type levels. The data represent unprecedented recovery of inner ear function and suggest that biological therapies to treat deafness may be suitable for translation to humans with genetic inner ear disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2586762515,"Efficient gene transfer to the mouse inner ear is achieved with a synthetic adeno-associated viral vector. Efforts to develop gene therapies for hearing loss have been hampered by the lack of safe, efficient, and clinically relevant delivery modalities1,2. Here we demonstrate the safety and efficiency of Anc80L65, a rationally designed synthetic vector3, for transgene delivery to the mouse cochlea. Ex vivo transduction of mouse organotypic explants identified Anc80L65 from a set of other adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors as a potent vector for the cochlear cell targets. Round window membrane injection resulted in highly efficient transduction of inner and outer hair cells in mice, a substantial improvement over conventional AAV vectors. Anc80L65 round window injection was well tolerated, as indicated by sensory cell function, hearing and vestibular function, and immunologic parameters. The ability of Anc80L65 to target outer hair cells at high rates, a requirement for restoration of complex auditory function, may enable future gene therapies for hearing and balance disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2584451192,"Although the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) extends throughout axons and axonal ER dysfunction is implicated in numerous neurological diseases, its role at nerve terminals is poorly understood. We developed novel genetically encoded ER-targeted low-affinity Ca2+ indicators optimized for examining axonal ER Ca2+. Our experiments revealed that presynaptic function is tightly controlled by ER Ca2+ content. We found that neuronal activity drives net Ca2+ uptake into presynaptic ER although this activity does not contribute significantly to shaping cytosolic Ca2+ except during prolonged repetitive firing. In contrast, we found that axonal ER acts as an actuator of plasma membrane (PM) function: [Ca2+]ER controls STIM1 activation in presynaptic terminals, which results in the local modulation of presynaptic function, impacting activity-driven Ca2+ entry and release probability. These experiments reveal a critical role of presynaptic ER in the control of neurotransmitter release and will help frame future investigations into the molecular basis of ER-driven neuronal disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2587288954,"Antitumor T cells are subject to multiple mechanisms of negative regulation. Recent findings that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) regulate adaptive T cell responses led us to examine the regulatory potential of ILCs in the context of cancer. We identified a unique ILC population that inhibits tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from high-grade serous tumors, defined their suppressive capacity in vitro, and performed a comprehensive analysis of their phenotype. Notably, the presence of this CD56+CD3- population in TIL cultures was associated with reduced T cell numbers, and further functional studies demonstrated that this population suppressed TIL expansion and altered TIL cytokine production. Transcriptome analysis and phenotypic characterization determined that regulatory CD56+CD3- cells exhibit low cytotoxic activity, produce IL-22, and have an expression profile that overlaps with those of natural killer (NK) cells and other ILCs. NKp46 was highly expressed by these cells, and addition of anti-NKp46 antibodies to TIL cultures abrogated the ability of these regulatory ILCs to suppress T cell expansion. Notably, the presence of these regulatory ILCs in TIL cultures corresponded with a striking reduction in the time to disease recurrence. These studies demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized ILC population regulates the activity and expansion of tumor-associated T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2586169653,"A method enabling copy-number analysis of single cells from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples is described, validated and applied to analyze samples of synchronous ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast carcinoma. A substantial proportion of tumors consist of genotypically distinct subpopulations of cancer cells. This intratumor genetic heterogeneity poses a substantial challenge for the implementation of precision medicine. Single-cell genomics constitutes a powerful approach to resolve complex mixtures of cancer cells by tracing cell lineages and discovering cryptic genetic variations that would otherwise be obscured in tumor bulk analyses. Because of the chemical alterations that result from formalin fixation, single-cell genomic approaches have largely remained limited to fresh or rapidly frozen specimens. Here we describe the development and validation of a robust and accurate methodology to perform whole-genome copy-number profiling of single nuclei obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical tumor samples. We applied the single-cell sequencing approach described here to study the progression from in situ to invasive breast cancer, which revealed that ductal carcinomas in situ show intratumor genetic heterogeneity at diagnosis and that these lesions may progress to invasive breast cancer through a variety of evolutionary processes."

https://openalex.org/W2585656693,"Elm (Ulmus) has a long history of use as a high-quality heavy hardwood famous for its resistance to drought, cold, and salt. It grows in temperate, warm temperate, and subtropical regions. This is the first report of Ulmaceae chloroplast genomes by de novo sequencing. The Ulmus chloroplast genomes exhibited a typical quadripartite structure with two single-copy regions (long single copy [LSC] and short single copy [SSC] sections) separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IRs). The lengths of the chloroplast genomes from five Ulmus ranged from 158,953 to 159,453 bp, with the largest observed in Ulmus davidiana and the smallest in Ulmus laciniata. The genomes contained 137-145 protein-coding genes, of which Ulmus davidiana var. japonica and U. davidiana had the most and U. pumila had the fewest. The five Ulmus species exhibited different evolutionary routes, as some genes had been lost. In total, 18 genes contained introns, 13 of which (trnL-TAA+, trnL-TAA-, rpoC1-, rpl2-, ndhA-, ycf1, rps12-, rps12+, trnA-TGC+, trnA-TGC-, trnV-TAC-, trnI-GAT+, and trnI-GAT) were shared among all five species. The intron of ycf1 was the longest (5,675bp) while that of trnF-AAA was the smallest (53bp). All Ulmus species except U. davidiana exhibited the same degree of amplification in the IR region. To determine the phylogenetic positions of the Ulmus species, we performed phylogenetic analyses using common protein-coding genes in chloroplast sequences of 42 other species published in NCBI. The cluster results showed the closest plants to Ulmaceae were Moraceae and Cannabaceae, followed by Rosaceae. Ulmaceae and Moraceae both belonged to Urticales, and the chloroplast genome clustering results were consistent with their traditional taxonomy. The results strongly supported the position of Ulmaceae as a member of the order Urticales. In addition, we found a potential error in the traditional taxonomies of U. davidiana and U. davidiana var. japonica, which should be confirmed with a further analysis of their nuclear genomes. This study is the first report on Ulmus chloroplast genomes, which has significance for understanding photosynthesis, evolution, and chloroplast transgenic engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2586149603,"Peritoneum is the most common site for ovarian cancer metastasis. Here we investigate how cancer epigenetics regulates reciprocal tumor-stromal interactions in peritoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer. Firstly, we find that omental stromal fibroblasts enhance colony formation of metastatic ovarian cancer cells, and de novo expression of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α) is induced in stromal fibroblasts co-cultured with ovarian cancer cells. We also observed an over-expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in ovarian cancer cells, which is regulated by promoter DNA hypomethylation as well as chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, this ovarian cancer-derived TNF-α induces TGF-α transcription in stromal fibroblasts through nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). We further show that TGF-α secreted by stromal fibroblasts in turn promotes peritoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Finally, we identify a TNFα-TGFα-EGFR interacting loop between tumor and stromal compartments of human omental metastases. Our results therefore demonstrate cancer epigenetics induces a loop of cancer-stroma-cancer interaction in omental microenvironment that promotes peritoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer cells via TNFα-TGFα-EGFR."
https://openalex.org/W2587202385,"Wild-type p53 (wtp53) is described as a tumour suppressor gene; mutations in this gene occur in many human cancers and promote oncogenic capacity. Here, we establish that the oncogenic activity of mutant p53 (mtp53) is driven by the WASP-interacting protein (WIP). WIP knockdown from mtp53-expressing glioblastoma and breast cancer cells (BCC) greatly reduced proliferation and growth capacity of cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells and decreased CSC-like markers (CD133, CD44 or YAP/TAZ). mtp53 overexpression in human astrocytes enhanced their proliferative capacity in suspension culture and increased expression of CSC markers and WIP. WIP knockdown compromised tumour glioblastoma and BCC growth capacity in vivo. We show that WIP is phosphorylated by AKT2 and is regulated by mtp53/p63 through enhancement of PI3K/AKT2-mediated integrin/receptor recycling pathways. WIP regulates this oncogenic pathway by controlling YAP/TAZ stability. We thus establish a new CSC signalling pathway downstream of mtp53 in which AKT2 regulates WIP and controls YAP/TAZ stability."
https://openalex.org/W2587293106,"In 1893 August Weismann proposed that information about the environment could not pass from somatic cells to germ cells, a hypothesis now known as the Weismann barrier. However, recent studies have indicated that parental exposure to environmental stress can modify progeny physiology and that parental stress can contribute to progeny disorders. The mechanisms regulating these phenomena are poorly understood. We report that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can protect itself from osmotic stress by entering a state of arrested development and can protect its progeny from osmotic stress by increasing the expression of the glycerol biosynthetic enzyme GPDH-2 in progeny. Both of these protective mechanisms are regulated by insulin-like signalling: insulin-like signalling to the intestine regulates developmental arrest, while insulin-like signalling to the maternal germline regulates glycerol metabolism in progeny. Thus, there is a heritable link between insulin-like signalling to the maternal germline and progeny metabolism and gene expression. We speculate that analogous modulation of insulin-like signalling to the germline is responsible for effects of the maternal environment on human diseases that involve insulin signalling, such as obesity and type-2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2587265764,"Sacculus is a peptidoglycan (PG) matrix that protects bacteria from osmotic lysis. In Gram-positive organisms, the sacculus is densely functionalized with glycopolymers important for survival, but the way in which assembly occurs is not known. In Staphylococcus aureus, three LCP (LytR-CpsA-Psr) family members have been implicated in attaching the major glycopolymer wall teichoic acid (WTA) to PG, but ligase activity has not been demonstrated for these or any other LCP proteins. Using WTA and PG substrates produced chemoenzymatically, we show that all three proteins can transfer WTA precursors to nascent PGs, establishing that LCP proteins are PG-glycopolymer ligases. Although all S. aureus LCP proteins have the capacity to attach WTA to PG, we show that their cellular functions are not redundant. Strains lacking lcpA have phenotypes similar to those of WTA-null strains, indicating that this is the most important WTA ligase. This work provides a foundation for studying how LCP enzymes participate in cell wall assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2587432179,"Spectroscopic studies of allosteric activation of Aurora A kinase using a site-specific infrared probe combined with FRET analysis and molecular dynamics simulations reveals a water-mediated hydrogen bond network in the active site that regulates Aurora A activity. The catalytic activity of many protein kinases is controlled by conformational changes of a conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif. We used an infrared probe to track the DFG motif of the mitotic kinase Aurora A (AurA) and found that allosteric activation by the spindle-associated protein Tpx2 involves an equilibrium shift toward the active DFG-in state. Förster resonance energy transfer experiments show that the activation loop undergoes a nanometer-scale movement that is tightly coupled to the DFG equilibrium. Tpx2 further activates AurA by stabilizing a water-mediated allosteric network that links the C-helix to the active site through an unusual polar residue in the regulatory spine. The polar spine residue and water network of AurA are essential for phosphorylation-driven activation, but an alternative form of the water network found in related kinases can support Tpx2-driven activation, suggesting that variations in the water-mediated hydrogen bond network mediate regulatory diversification in protein kinases."

However, the loss of thermosensors only partially impairs heat nociception, suggesting the existence of undiscovered mechanisms. We found that the loss of an intracellular fibroblast growth factor (FGF), FGF13, in the mouse DRG neurons selectively abolished heat nociception. The noxious heat stimuli could not evoke the sustained action potential firing in FGF13-deficient DRG neurons. Furthermore, FGF13 interacted with the sodium channel Nav1.7 in a heat-facilitated manner. FGF13 increased Nav1.7 sodium currents and maintained the membrane localization of Nav1.7 during noxious heat stimulation, enabling the sustained firing of action potentials. Disrupting the FGF13/Nav1.7 interaction reduced the heat-evoked action potential firing and nociceptive behavior. Thus, beyond the thermosensors, the FGF13/Nav1.7 complex is essential for sustaining the transmission of noxious heat signals.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are classified into secretory (FGF1–10 and FGF15–23) or intracellular, non-secretory forms (FGF11–14) (Guillemot and Zimmer, 2011Guillemot F. Zimmer C.

Noxious stimuli (e.g., thermal, mechanical, and chemical) cause pain by activating cutaneous Aδ and C nociceptors, the peripheral terminals of small-diameter DRG neurons. Our recent neuron-typing study analyzed the transcriptome and functions of DRG neurons, and at least six types of mechanoheat nociceptors (MHNs) were identified (Li et al., 2016Li C.L. Li K.C. Wu D.

The transduction of nociceptive signals involves special membrane proteins sensitive to a particular stimulus. For instance, the transient receptor potential cation channel V1 (TRPV1) expressed in small DRG neurons serves as a thermosensor (>42°C). However, the TRPV1 gene knockout mice only showed a partial reduction of the nociceptive behaviors induced by intense heat stimuli (>52°C) and did not exhibit apparent reduction in response to noxious heat stimuli below 48°C (Caterina et al., 2000Caterina M.J.

In hippocampal and cerebellar neurons, FGF14 is localized at the initial segment of axons and interacts with Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.6 (Laezza et al., 2007Laezza F. Gerber B.R. Lou J.Y.

The genetic ablation of Fgf12 and Fgf14 in mice results in ataxia and paroxysmal dystonia (Goldfarb et al., 2007Goldfarb M. Schoorlemmer J. Williams A. Diwakar S. Wang Q. Huang X. Giza J.

Neurosci. 2007; 34: 366-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). FGF13 co-localizes with Nav1.6 at the Ranvier nodes along the myelinated nerve fibers, and FGF13 overexpression increases the sodium current density in ND7/23 cells (Wittmack et al., 2004Wittmack E.K. Rush A.M. Craner M.J. Goldfarb M. Waxman S.G. Dib-Hajj S.D. Fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 2B: association with Nav1.6 and selective colocalization at nodes of Ranvier of dorsal root axons.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6765-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have shown that FGF13 is expressed in small DRG neurons (Li et al., 2002Li G.D. Wo Y. Zhong M.F. Zhang F.X. Bao L. Lu Y.J. Huang Y.D. Xiao H.S. Zhang X. Expression of fibroblast growth factors in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons and regulation after peripheral nerve injury.Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 1903-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, its function in somatosensation remains unknown. Here, we reveal a role of FGF13 in noxious heat sensation in mice. The FGF13 deletion in DRG neurons selectively abolished heat nociception and reduced the heat-evoked neuronal firing. FGF13 interacted with Nav1.7, and this heat-facilitated interaction maintained the cell membrane localization of Nav1.7, enabling the heat-evoked AP firing. Disrupting the FGF13/Nav1.7 interaction reduced both heat-induced AP firing and nociceptive behavior. Thus, our study provides a molecular mechanism essential for heat nociception beyond thermosensors. We first examined the FGF13 expression profile in the nervous systems of adult mice by immunoblotting and found that FGF13 was abundant in the DRG (Figure S1A). Immunostaining showed that FGF13 was present in 83.4% ± 4.3% (n = 3 mice) of small DRG neurons (Figure 1A; Figure S1B). FGF13 was present in both the dorsal root and the sciatic nerve (Figure S1C), suggesting that FGF13 synthesized in somata of DRG neurons is transported to their central and peripheral terminals. Double immunostaining showed that 60.6% ± 6.6% of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-positive neurons (n = 3 mice, 100–200 neurons per mouse) and 86.1% ± 3.2% of isolectin B4 (IB4)-positive neurons (n = 3 mice, 100–200 neurons per mouse) expressed FGF13 (Figure S1D). FGF13 was also detected in the DRG afferent fibers in the laminae I-II of spinal cord (SC), where C and Aδ fibers terminate, as well as efferent fibers in the glabrous skin (Figure 1A; Figure S1E). We used single-cell RNA sequencing and electrophysiological recording to categorize DRG neuron types (Li et al., 2016Li C.L. Li K.C. Wu D. Chen Y. Luo H. Zhao J.R. Wang S.S. Sun M.M. Lu Y.J. Zhong Y.Q. et al.Somatosensory neuron types identified by high-coverage single-cell RNA-sequencing and functional heterogeneity.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 83-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and found that FGF13 was highly expressed in five types of MHNs (C1, C2, C4, C5, and C6) (Figure S1F) (Li et al., 2016Li C.L. Li K.C. Wu D. Chen Y. Luo H. Zhao J.R. Wang S.S. Sun M.M. Lu Y.J. Zhong Y.Q. et al.Somatosensory neuron types identified by high-coverage single-cell RNA-sequencing and functional heterogeneity.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 83-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 were also expressed in these neuron types, while TRPV1 was mainly expressed in C1 and C2 (Figure S1F). The co-expression of Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 in DRG neurons was confirmed with dual fluorescent in situ hybridization (81.8% ± 0.5% of Nav1.7 mRNA-expressing neurons contained Nav1.8 mRNA and 95.0% ± 0.3% of Nav1.8 mRNA-expressing neurons contained Nav1.7 mRNA, n = 3 mice, 100–200 neurons per mouse) (Figure S1G). To determine the FGF13 function, we deleted FGF13 gene (Fgf13) in small DRG neurons by crossing homozygous Fgf13-flox mice with a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse line expressing Cre recombinase controlled by promoter elements of the Nav1.8 gene (SNS-Cre) (Agarwal et al., 2004Agarwal N. Offermanns S. Kuner R. Conditional gene deletion in primary nociceptive neurons of trigeminal ganglia and dorsal root ganglia.Genesis. 2004; 38: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Figure S2A). Then, behavioral tests were performed with the control Fgf13-flox mice (Fgf13F/Y) and the Fgf13 knockout mice (SNS-Cre/Fgf13F/Y; Fgf13−/Y). In Fgf13−/Y mice, FGF13 expression was reduced in DRG neurons, afferent fibers in the dorsal spinal cord and efferent fibers in the skin (Figures 1A and 1B). There were no apparent changes in the total number and morphology of DRG neurons (Figures S2B and S2C), the structure of their fibers and synapses in the dorsal spinal cord, or their nerve innervation in the skin (Figures S2D–S2G). The synaptic transmission from the DRG to dorsal spinal cord neurons was also normal (Figure S2H). Thus, the tissue structure and synaptic transmission in Fgf13−/Y mice are largely unaltered. Interestingly, the noxious heat-induced behavioral responses were abolished in Fgf13−/Y mice, while the innocuous temperature detection and the responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were not affected. It is generally accepted that heat nociceptors are activated by noxious heat above 43°C. In the tail-flick test at 48°C, 50°C, or 52°C, Fgf13−/Y mice did not respond to the heat stimulation even when the cutoff time of 20 s, 15 s, or 10 s was reached, respectively (Figure 1C). Similarly, Fgf13−/Y mice did not exhibit avoidance behavior during the Hargreaves test (radiant heat test) (Figure 1D). In the hot plate test, at 50°C, 52°C, or 55°C (with cutoff time of 70 s, 50 s, or 30 s, respectively), the mutant mice did not respond to the heat stimulation (Figure 1E). Furthermore, in the CFA inflammatory pain model, Fgf13−/Y mice were insensitive to the noxious heat stimulation, while Fgf13F/Y mice showed obvious hyperalgesic responses (Figure 1F). The mechanical hypersensitivity induced by CFA or the spared nerve injury (SNI), a model of neuropathic pain, was not altered by FGF13 loss (Figures S3A and S3B). These results indicate that noxious heat sensation is absent in Fgf13−/Y mice. In contrast, Fgf13−/Y mice had normal responses to evaporative cooling (Figure S3C). In the two-temperature choice test, Fgf13−/Y mice tended to choose the innocuous warm temperature (30°C) and avoid noxious cold (5°C and 15°C) or noxious heat (48°C and 55°C), suggesting that they were able to distinguish different temperatures; yet, their tolerance to noxious heat was increased (Figure 1G). Fgf13−/Y mice exhibited normal mechanical nociceptive responses in both the von Frey and Randall-Selitto (tail clip) tests (Figure S3D). We used formalin test to examine the chemical nociception and found that Fgf13−/Y mice, like wild-type mice, exhibited two-phase nociceptive responses, but the phase II was delayed without changes in its peak level (Figure S3E), suggesting that chemical nociception was mildly changed. Moreover, FGF13-deficient mice showed normal locomotor functions in rotarod and open field tests (Figures S3F and S3G). Furthermore, microarray analysis showed no prominent change (>2-fold change, p < 0.05, n = 3) in mRNA levels of other FGFs, sodium channels, thermosensors—such as TRP channels (Caterina et al., 2000Caterina M.J.

Yang Y.D. Lee J. Lee B. Kim T. Jang Y. Back S.K. Na H.S. Harfe B.D. Wang F. et al.The calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin 1 acts as a heat sensor in nociceptive neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) in the DRG of Fgf13−/Y mice (Figure S3H). This is consistent with the result of semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (Figure S3I). However, the protein levels of Nav1.8 and TRPV1 were elevated in the DRG of Fgf13−/Y mice (Figure S4A), suggesting a compensatory reaction in the mutant mice. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording showed that both the percentage of small DRG neurons sensitive to TRPV1 agonist capsaicin and the amplitude of capsaicin-induced current were increased (Figure S4B). Therefore, Fgf13−/Y mice exhibit a selective loss of heat nociception despite the compensatory increase of TRPV1 function. In Fgf13F/Y mice, noxious heat stimuli (47.5°C) applied to the surface of left hindpaw elicited robust fMRI activation across the brain, but these stimuli elicited limited activation and more negative signals in Fgf13−/Y mice (Figure 1H). To determine the most-affected brain regions, we compared the activation maps between the Fgf13F/Y and the Fgf13−/Y groups and described the response differences in a statistical difference map (Figure 1H). The FGF13 deficiency eliminated the majority of noxious heat-evoked responses. The primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory, retrosplenial granular (RSG), and insular (Ins) cortices, as well as the amygdala (Amyg), the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen, CPu), the CA1 region of hippocampus (HPC), and the mediodorsal (MD) and parafascicular (PF) nuclei of thalamus showed different responses between two groups. Many of these brain regions are known to be involved in nociception (Treede et al., 1999Treede R.D. Kenshalo D.R. Gracely R.H. Jones A.K. The cortical representation of pain.Pain. 1999; 79: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). To analyze how the FGF13 loss differentially affected brain regions, we further compared the magnitudes (i.e., signal change percentages) of noxious heat responses in ten brain regions between Fgf13F/Y and Fgf13−/Y mice (Figures 1I–1K). The fMRI signal magnitudes in Fgf13F/Y mice were robust (0.5%–1.5%) and over 2-fold greater than those in Fgf13−/Y mice (0.2%–0.5%). Some areas showed apparent lateralized responses. For example, the contralateral S1 (F/Y–R) of Fgf13F/Y mice responded strongly to heat stimuli, whereas the ipsilateral S1 (F/Y–L) showed very weak signal change (Figure 1I). Response magnitudes of the contra- and ipsilateral S1 in Fgf13−/Y mice were equally weak, comparable to that of the ipsilateral S1 in Fgf13F/Y mice. Other brain regions of Fgf13F/Y mice, including the Amyg, S2, CPu, HPC, and Ins, were equally activated in both hemispheres. The noxious heat-induced activation signals in these regions were eliminated in Fgf13−/Y mice. The responses also reduced in the RSG, two thalamic nuclei (MD and PF), and the PAG (Figure 1J). FGF13 deficiency affected the Amyg to the greatest degree, followed by the CPu, Ins, S2, and RSG. The S1 cortex exhibited the smallest difference in the magnitude (Figure 1K). Thus, FGF13 deficiency in DRG neurons reduces noxious heat-evoked responses in the brain. To examine whether the heat sensation loss of Fgf13−/Y mice was caused by the change of nociceptor sensitivity to heat stimuli, we applied heat ramps from room temperature (22°C–25°C) to noxious heat levels 45°C–49°C to small DRG neurons (10–20 μm in diameter) of Fgf13F/Y and Fgf13−/Y mice (Figure 2A). The percentage of noxious heat-sensitive neurons was similar in two groups (38.1% for Fgf13F/Y, n = 42; 35.9% for Fgf13−/Y, n = 39) (Figure 2B). We analyzed the distribution pattern of APs through the percentage of AP numbers at each degree. In small DRG neurons of Fgf13F/Y mice, the AP firing rate started to accelerate at ∼42°C, reached maximum at 43°C, and remained at that level to 45°C (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D). In contrast, the AP firing in small DRG neurons of Fgf13−/Y mice gradually decreased in response to temperature elevation and tended to cease at 45°C (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D). Moreover, the AP amplitude was relatively uniform following the all-or-none rule in Fgf13F/Y neurons, whereas the AP amplitude exhibited a rapid decline in Fgf13−/Y neurons as temperature increased (Figures 2A, 2E, and 2F). The fitting curves of the AP amplitudes from 38°C to 45°C showed that the AP amplitude reduced more sharply in Fgf13−/Y neurons (Figure 2E). When normalized to the amplitude of the first AP, AP amplitude at 45°C was 66.2% ± 0.06% in Fgf13F/Y neurons (n = 16) and 9.3% ± 0.05% in Fgf13−/Y neurons (n = 14) (Figure 2F). The heat-induced attenuation of AP firing in Fgf13−/Y neurons was not caused by impaired neuronal responsiveness because APs were efficiently triggered by current injection after the heat stimulation (Figure S5A). Therefore, FGF13-deficient small DRG neurons exhibit attenuated AP firing during noxious heat stimulation, although they are capable of detecting thermal changes below 42°C. To further evaluate the distinct roles of FGF13 and TRPV1 in noxious heat sensation, we examined heat-induced AP firing in TRPV1-deficient DRG neurons for comparison. The percentage of heat-sensitive small DRG neurons (35.2%, n = 71 wild-type neurons) was decreased in Trpv1 knockout (Trpv1−/−) mice (16.1%, n = 78) (Figure 2B). However, the remaining heat-sensitive neurons responded to heat stimuli with an accelerating frequency and an evenly distributed amplitude in a manner that was similar to that of wild-type neurons (Figures 2C–2F). The AP amplitude at 45°C was reduced to 62.5% ± 0.12% in TRPV1-deficient neurons (n = 11), similar to that in wild-type neurons (p = 0.77). Thus, although more than half of the DRG neurons lost the responsiveness to heat stimuli in Trpv1−/− mice, a considerable number of neurons remained intact in heat sensitivity. These results differ from that in Fgf13−/Y mice, in which the number of noxious heat-sensitive DRG neurons was not reduced, but the AP amplitude decreased while temperature increased into noxious heat range (Figures 2A–2F), suggesting that FGF13 and TRPV1 participate in heat sensation through different mechanisms. To confirm the role of FGF13 in heat nociception, we further investigated whether the loss of heat sensation in Fgf13−/Y mice could be reversed by acute application of exogenous FGF13 protein. GST-tagged FGF13B was fused with a TAT peptide, which is a membrane-penetrating vector developed from the human immunodeficiency virus (Schwarze et al., 1999Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. In vivo protein transduction: delivery of a biologically active protein into the mouse.Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar) (GST-FGF13B-TAT). GST-FGF13B-TAT incubation (1 μM for 120 min) reversed the reduced AP firing during noxious heat stimulation in Fgf13−/Y DRG neurons; the AP amplitude at 45°C returned to"

Although it is generally believed that RASopathies are caused by altered levels of pathway activation, the signaling changes in developing tissues remain largely unknown. We used assays with spatiotemporal resolution in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and Danio rerio (zebrafish) to quantify signaling changes caused by mutations in MAP2K1 (encoding MEK), a core component of the Ras pathway that is mutated in both RASopathies and cancers in humans. Surprisingly, we discovered that intrinsically active MEK variants can both increase and reduce the levels of pathway activation in vivo. The sign of the effect depends on cellular context, implying that some of the emerging phenotypes in RASopathies may be caused by increased, as well as attenuated, levels of Ras signaling."

Harnessing these dechlorinating processes could provide an opportunity for environmental remediation, but detailed catalytic mechanisms for these enzymes are not yet known. To close this gap, we now report transient kinetics and product analysis of the dechlorinating flavin-dependent monooxygenase, HadA, from the aerobic organism Ralstonia pickettii DTP0602, identifying several mechanistic properties that differ from other enzymes in the same class. We first overexpressed and purified HadA to homogeneity. Analyses of the products from single and multiple turnover reactions demonstrated that HadA prefers 4-CP and 2-CP over CPs with multiple substituents. Stopped-flow and rapid-quench flow experiments of HadA with 4-CP show the involvement of specific intermediates (C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD and C4a-hydroxy-FAD) in the reaction, define rate constants and the order of substrate binding, and demonstrate that the hydroxylation step occurs prior to chloride elimination. The data also identify the non-productive and productive paths of the HadA reactions and demonstrate that product formation is the rate-limiting step. This is the first elucidation of the kinetic mechanism of a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase that can catalyze oxidative dechlorination of various CPs, and as such it will serve as the basis for future investigation of enzyme variants that will be useful for applications in detoxifying chemicals hazardous to human health.

https://openalex.org/W2583494745,"There is a growing interest in identifying natural food ingredients that may serve to prevent dementia such as that due to Alzheimer disease (AD). Peptides derived from food proteins have been demonstrated to have various physiological activities such as a hypotensive action. Recent findings have indicated possible associations of hypertension with AD progression, and suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with potential to pass through the blood brain barrier (BBB) may reduce the risk of AD. In this study, we investigated the effect of milk peptide (CH-3) on cognitive function in AD model mice. CH-3 contains a tripeptide (methionine-lysine-proline, MKP) that has been found to have a strong ACE inhibitory effect and the potential to pass through the BBB. Adult male ddY mice were used in this study, and an animal model of AD was induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Aβ1-42. CH-3 (250 mg/kg/day) or MKP (0.5 mg/kg/day) was orally administered every day starting 2 days before ICV injection. At 3 weeks after ICV injection, cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze test. Brain samples were obtained after behavioral testing, and expression of inflammatory cytokines and NADPH oxidase subunits was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. ICV injection of Aβ1-42 significantly impaired cognitive function compared with that in PBS-injected mice. Daily administration of CH-3 markedly attenuated this Aβ1-42-induced cognitive decline. Aβ1-42 injection significantly enhanced the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and p22phox in the mouse hippocampus compared with PBS injection, and showed a tendency to increase the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), p47phox and gp91phox, whereas CH-3 treatment markedly reduced Aβ1-42-induced TNF-α, MCP-1, iNOS, p47phox and gp91phox expression. Finally, administration of MKP also attenuated Aβ1-42-induced cognitive impairment with an increase in cerebral blood flow. The present study demonstrated that repeated oral administration of CH-3 to AD model mice not only improved cognitive function but also suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines and production of oxidative stress, and suggests its therapeutic potential for preventing cognitive impairment in AD."

https://openalex.org/W2585774534,"During DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, short single-stranded DNA segments known as Okazaki fragments are first synthesized on the lagging strand. The Okazaki fragments originate from ∼35-nucleotide-long RNA-DNA primers. After Okazaki fragment synthesis, these primers must be removed to allow fragment joining into a continuous lagging strand. To date, the models of enzymatic machinery that removes the RNA-DNA primers have come almost exclusively from biochemical reconstitution studies and some genetic interaction assays, and there is little direct evidence to confirm these models. One obstacle to elucidating Okazaki fragment processing has been the lack of methods that can directly examine primer removal in vivo. In this study, we developed an electron microscopy assay that can visualize nucleotide flap structures on DNA replication forks in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). With this assay, we first demonstrated the generation of flap structures during Okazaki fragment processing in vivo. The mean and median lengths of the flaps in wild-type cells were ∼51 and ∼41 nucleotides, respectively. We also used yeast mutants to investigate the impact of deleting key DNA replication nucleases on these flap structures. Our results provided direct in vivo evidence for a previously proposed flap cleavage pathway and the critical function of Dna2 and Fen1 in cleaving these flaps. In addition, we found evidence for another previously proposed exonucleolytic pathway involving RNA-DNA primer digestion by exonucleases RNase H2 and Exo1. Taken together, our observations suggest a dual mechanism for Okazaki fragment maturation in lagging strand synthesis and establish a new strategy for interrogation of this fascinating process."

The Executive Functions Module from the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery and the Iowa Gambling Task were the primary cognitive predictors of reported phishing suspiciousness. Other predictors included age group (older vs. younger), sex, education, race, ethnicity, prior knowledge of phishing, prior susceptibility to phishing, and whether or not browsing behaviors were reportedly different in the laboratory setting versus at home. A logistic regression, which accounted for a 22.7% reduction in error variance compared to the null model and predicted phishing suspiciousness with 73.1% (95% CI [66.0, 80.3]) accuracy, revealed three statistically significant predictors: the main effect of education (b = 0.58, SE = 0.27) and the interactions of age group with prior awareness of phishing (b = 2.31, SE = 1.12) and performance on the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Mazes test (b = 0.16, SE = 0.07). Whether or not older adults reported being suspicious of the phishing attacks used in this study was partially explained by educational history and prior phishing knowledge. This suggests that simple educational interventions may be effective in reducing phishing vulnerability. Although one test of executive functioning was found useful for identifying those at risk of phishing susceptibility, four tests were not found to be useful; these results speak to the need for more ecologically valid tools in clinical neuropsychology."
https://openalex.org/W2585373193,"Background Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an indolent disease stage, considered to represent the transition phase from the premalignant MGUS (Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance) state towards symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM). Even though this diagnosis provides an opportunity for early intervention, few treatment studies have been done and the current standard of care is observation until progression. BI-505, a monoclonal antibody directed against intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) with promising anti-myeloma activity in preclinical trials, is a possible treatment approach for this patient category with potential to eliminate tumor cells with minimal long-term side effects. BI-505 was well tolerated in an earlier phase 1 trial. Methods and findings In this phase 2 trial the effects of BI-505 in patients with SMM were studied. Four patients were enrolled and three of them completed the first cycle of treatment defined as 5 doses of BI-505, a total of 43 mg/kg BW, over a 7-week period. In the three evaluable patients, BI-505 showed a benign safety profile. None of the patients achieved a response as defined per protocol. EudraCT number: 2012-004884-29. Conclusions The study was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamics of BI-505 in patients with SMM. BI-505 showed no clinically relevant efficacy on disease activity in these patients with SMM, even if well tolerated. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01838369."
https://openalex.org/W2585721747,"Background There is an urgent need for accurate and rapid diagnostic tests to identify carbapenemase producing enterobacteria (CPE). Here, we have evaluated the Carbapenem Inactivation Method (CIM) test to detect CPEs from cultured colonies. Methods A total of 256 enterobacterial isolates were used to evaluate the performance of the CIM in comparison to Carba NP test and molecular detection used a reference method. Ninety three well-characterized isolates (including 29 non-CPE and 63 CPEs of worldwide origin) with decreased susceptibility to at least one carbapenem were used to (i) evaluate the efficacy of CIM test and (ii) to compare it to the Carba NP test. We also tested different carbapenems to determine the best substrate for this test. Finally, the CIM test was then evaluated prospectively against 164 isolates referred to the French National Reference Center (NRC) for Antimicrobial Resistance from may 2016 to july 2016. Results Based on the results of this retrospective study, sensitivity and specificity of the CIM and the Carba NP test were 92.1% and 100%, respectively. We demonstrated that the meropenem was the best substrate to perform the CIM test since sensitivity and specificity were 81.1% and 100% using ertapenem disk, and 100% and 65,6% using imipenem disk, and respectively. Taking in account the results of retrospective and prospective studies, CIM and Carba NP tests have similar sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values being 96.3%, 98.9%, 99.0% and 98.4% for the CIM test versus 96.9%, 100%, 100% and 100% for the Carba NP test. Conclusions Our results confirm that the CIM test may be a useful tool for the reliable confirmation of carbapenemase-activity in enterobacterial isolates, especially in clinical microbiological laboratories with limited resources, no trained personnel, and no specialized equipment."
https://openalex.org/W2586999592,"Targeted therapeutics, such as those abrogating hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)/vascular endothelial growth factor signaling, are initially effective against kidney cancer (or renal cell carcinoma, RCC); however, drug resistance frequently occurs via subsequent activation of alternative pathways. Through genome-scale integrated analysis of the HIF-α network, we identified the major protein kinase C substrate MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) as a potential target molecule for kidney cancer. In a screen of nephrectomy samples from 56 patients with RCC, we found that MARCKS expression and its phosphorylation are increased and positively correlate with tumor grade. Genetic and pharmacologic suppression of MARCKS in high-grade RCC cell lines in vitro led to a decrease in cell proliferation and migration. We further demonstrated that higher MARCKS expression promotes growth and angiogenesis in vivo in an RCC xenograft tumor. MARCKS acted upstream of the AKT/mTOR pathway, activating HIF-target genes, notably vascular endothelial growth factor-A. Following knockdown of MARCKS in RCC cells, the IC50 of the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib was reduced. Surprisingly, attenuation of MARCKS using the MPS (MARCKS phosphorylation site domain) peptide synergistically interacted with regorafenib treatment and decreased survival of kidney cancer cells through inactivation of AKT and mTOR. Our data suggest a major contribution of MARCKS to kidney cancer growth and provide an alternative therapeutic strategy of improving the efficacy of multikinase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2587553267,"The Ni(ii) affinity of Ni(ii) sensor InrS is attuned to buffered Ni(ii) concentrations, explaining why these two parameters co-vary for different metals over many orders of magnitude. The metal affinities of metal-sensing transcriptional regulators co-vary with cellular metal concentrations over more than 12 orders of magnitude. To understand the cause of this relationship, we determined the structure of the Ni(II) sensor InrS and then created cyanobacteria (Synechocystis PCC 6803) in which transcription of genes encoding a Ni(II) exporter and a Ni(II) importer were controlled by InrS variants with weaker Ni(II) affinities. Variant strains were sensitive to elevated nickel and contained more nickel, but the increase was small compared with the change in Ni(II) affinity. All of the variant sensors retained the allosteric mechanism that inhibits DNA binding following metal binding, but a response to nickel in vivo was observed only when the sensitivity was set to respond in a relatively narrow (less than two orders of magnitude) range of nickel concentrations. Thus, the Ni(II) affinity of InrS is attuned to cellular metal concentrations rather than the converse."
https://openalex.org/W2583336452,"Elevated serum haptoglobin (Hp) is identified as a prognostic marker in multiple types of solid tumors, which is correlated with poor prognosis. HCC is one of the major causes of cancer deaths in worldwide, which remains poor prognosis and is clinically urgent for discovering early diagnostic markers. However, except for serum Hp, the correlation of tumor Hp expression with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated and identified the tissue Hp expression as a prognostic marker to predict the survival rate of HCC patients. To evaluate the prognostic value of Hp expression for HCC, two cohorts were enrolled in our study, including total 130 matched pair tissue sections (both adjacent non-tumorous and tumor tissue derived from same patient) of HCC patients from Changhua Christian Hospital (CCH) and total 316 RNA-seq data with clinical information of HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In contrast to other types of cancers, HCC tumor tissues have lower Hp protein expression in CCH cohort and have lower Hp mRNA expression in TCGA cohort as compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues (p < 0.001). Moreover, lower Hp expression is significantly correlated with different stages of HCC cancer differentiation in CCH cohort (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001). Most importantly, lower Hp expression is highly correlated with poor five-year overall survival rate in TCGA cohort (p < 0.01). Based on our data, we conclude that tissue Hp expression positively correlates with better HCC tumor differentiation and increased five-year overall survival rate of HCC patients. The results indicated that tissue Hp is potentially a prognostic marker for HCC patients. Our findings may further provide a new insight of effective treatments along with biopsy diagnosis of HCC patients."

Population-based controls gave the same information. With a modified factor analysis, we determined the optimal number of factors, factor loadings for each symptom, factor-specific factor-loading cutoffs and factor scores.Altogether data from 623 survivors and 344 population-based controls were analyzed. Six factors best explain the correlation structure of the symptoms; for five of these a statistically significant difference (P< 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) was found between survivors and controls concerning factor score quantiles. Taken together these five factors explain 42 percent of the variance of the symptoms. We interpreted these five factors as radiation-induced syndromes that may reflect distinct survivorship diseases. We obtained the following frequencies, defined as survivors having a factor loading above the 95 percent percentile of the controls, urgency syndrome (190 of 623, 30 percent), leakage syndrome (164 of 623, 26 percent), excessive gas discharge (93 of 623, 15 percent), excessive mucus discharge (102 of 623, 16 percent) and blood discharge (63 of 623, 10 percent).Late effects of radiotherapy include five syndromes affecting bowel health; studying them and identifying the underlying survivorship diseases, instead of the approximately 30 long-term symptoms they produce, will simplify the search for prevention, alleviation and elimination."
https://openalex.org/W2583163815,"Angiogenesis and inflammation are regarded as important factors in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation, cancer, and wound healing. Recent studies have supported prior evidence that common signaling pathways are involved in angiogenesis and inflammatory responses; however, key factors controlling both processes remain unclear. Although tripartite motif-containing (TRIM)-28 is known to have an immunosuppressive role in immune cells, its expression level and role in endothelial cells (ECs) are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of TRIM28 in inflammatory responses and angiogenic activity of ECs for the first time. We showed that TRIM28 is the most abundant TRIM family member and is localized in nuclei of ECs. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TRIM28 strikingly suppressed expression of TNF receptor (TNFR)-1 and −2, decreased TNFα-induced phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκBα and degradation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of p65, and suppressed basal level and TNF-α-induced expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules, including VCAM-1, IL-6, ICAM-1, E-selectin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. Unexpectedly, IL-8 was potentiated by TRIM28 knockdown in ECs in an NF-κB-inducing kinase–dependent manner. Meanwhile, knockdown of TRIM28 inhibited expression of VEGF receptor 2 and suppressed VEGF-induced proliferation and tube formation by ECs. Finally, knockdown of TRIM28 suppressed recruitment of ECs in vivo in a murine synthetic basement membrane model. In summary, we found that TRIM28 acts as a central factor in controlling endothelial inflammatory responses and angiogenic activities by retaining expression of TNFR-1 and −2 and VEGF receptor 2 in ECs.—Wang, Y., Li, J., Huang Y., Dai, X., Liu, Y., Liu, Z., Wang, Y., Wang, N., Zhang, P.

https://openalex.org/W2586693937,"Metastatic relapse remains largely incurable and a major challenge of clinical management in breast cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Herein, we report that CGI-99 is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues from patients with metastatic recurrence within 5 years. High CGI-99 significantly predicts poorer 5-year metastasis-free patient survival. We find that CGI-99 increases breast cancer stem cell properties, and potentiates efficient tumor lung colonization and outgrowth in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CGI-99 activates the autocrine interleukin-6 (IL-6)/STAT3 signaling by increasing the accumulation and activity of RNA polymerase II and p300 cofactor at the proximal promoter of IL-6. Importantly, delivery of the IL-6-receptor humanized monoclonal antibody tocilizumab robustly abrogates CGI-99-induced metastasis in vivo. Finally, we find that high levels of CGI-99 are significantly correlated with STAT3 hyperactivation in breast cancer patients. These findings reveal a potential mechanism for constitutive activation of autocrine IL-6/STAT3 signaling and may suggest a novel target for clinical intervention in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2587269166,"Dysregulation of the NF-κB transcription factor occurs in many cancer types. Krüppel-like family of transcription factors (KLFs) regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Here, we report a new mechanism of NF-κB activation in glioblastoma through depletion of the KLF6 tumor suppressor. We show that KLF6 transactivates multiple genes negatively controlling the NF-κB pathway and consequently reduces NF-κB nuclear localization and downregulates NF-κB targets. Reconstitution of KLF6 attenuates their malignant phenotype and induces neural-like differentiation and senescence, consistent with NF-κB pathway inhibition. KLF6 is heterozygously deleted in 74.5% of the analyzed glioblastomas and predicts unfavorable patient prognosis suggesting that haploinsufficiency is a clinically relevant means of evading KLF6-dependent regulation of NF-κB. Together, our study identifies a new mechanism by which KLF6 regulates NF-κB signaling, and how this mechanism is circumvented in glioblastoma through KLF6 loss."
https://openalex.org/W2585822716,"Due to different replication mechanisms between the leading and lagging strands, nucleotide composition asymmetries widely exist in bacterial genomes. A general consideration reveals that the leading strand is enriched in Guanine (G) and Thymine (T), and the lagging strand shows richness in Adenine (A) and Cytosine (C). However, some bacteria like Bacillus subtilis have been discovered composing more A than T in the leading strand. To investigate the difference, we analyze the nucleotide asymmetry from the aspect of AT and GC bias correlations. In this study, we propose a windowless method, the Z-curve Correlation Coefficient (ZCC) index, based on the Z-curve method, and analyzed more than 2000 bacterial genomes. We find that the majority of bacteria reveal negative correlations between AT and GC biases, while most genomes in Firmicutes and Tenericutes have positive ZCC indexes. The presence of PolC, purine asymmetry and stronger genes preference in the leading strand are not confined to Firmicutes, but also likely to happen in other phyla dominated by positive ZCC indexes. This method also provides a new insight into other relevant features like aerobism, and can be applied to analyze the correlation between RY (Purine and Pyrimidine) and MK (Amino and Keto) bias and so on."
https://openalex.org/W2526694099,"Learning based on networks of real neurons, and learning based on biologically inspired models of neural networks, have yet to find general learning rules leading to widespread applications. In this paper, we argue for the existence of a principle allowing to steer the dynamics of a biologically inspired neural network. Using carefully timed external stimulation, the network can be driven towards a desired dynamical state. We term this principle “Learning by Stimulation Avoidance” (LSA). We demonstrate through simulation that the minimal sufficient conditions leading to LSA in artificial networks are also sufficient to reproduce learning results similar to those obtained in biological neurons by Shahaf and Marom, and in addition explains synaptic pruning. We examined the underlying mechanism by simulating a small network of 3 neurons, then scaled it up to a hundred neurons. We show that LSA has a higher explanatory power than existing hypotheses about the response of biological neural networks to external simulation, and can be used as a learning rule for an embodied application: learning of wall avoidance by a simulated robot. In other works, reinforcement learning with spiking networks can be obtained through global reward signals akin simulating the dopamine system; we believe that this is the first project demonstrating sensory-motor learning with random spiking networks through Hebbian learning relying on environmental conditions without a separate reward system."

These experiments took into account the season of the year, apiary, colony, and developmental state and strength of the colony. The acaricides used were a synthetic (amitraz, Apivar®) and a natural (formulated from Api Life Var®, thymol oil and thymol alcohol) product. The treatments used in the present study reduce high infestations of V. destructor, although they do not eliminate the infestation. Similar efficacies between treatments were found. Nevertheless, the efficacy of a treatment depends on the apiary where applied. Moreover, the detected variability in the apiary and hive poses a challenge to the identification of the significant factors. Therefore, more field studies to assess efficacies in several apiaries are needed to obtain a better understanding of the effects of the applied treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2584960757,"Development, tissue homeostasis and tumor suppression depend critically on the correct regulation of cell division. Central in the cell division process is the decision whether to enter the next cell cycle and commit to going through the S and M phases, or to remain temporarily or permanently arrested. Cell cycle studies in genetic model systems could greatly benefit from visualizing cell cycle commitment in individual cells without the need of fixation. Here, we report the development and characterization of a reporter to monitor cell cycle entry in the nematode C. elegans. This reporter combines the mcm-4 promoter, to reveal Rb/E2F-mediated transcriptional control, and a live-cell sensor for CDK-activity. The CDK sensor was recently developed for use in human cells and consists of a DNA Helicase fragment fused to eGFP. Upon phosphorylation by CDKs, this fusion protein changes in localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The combined regulation of transcription and subcellular localization enabled us to visualize the moment of cell cycle entry in dividing seam cells during C. elegans larval development. This reporter is the first to reflect cell cycle commitment in C. elegans and will help further genetic studies of the mechanisms that underlie cell cycle entry and exit."
https://openalex.org/W2585308089,"Human RecQ-like helicase 4 (RECQL4) plays crucial roles in replication initiation and DNA repair; however, the contextual regulation of its unwinding activity is not fully described. Mutations in RECQL4 have been linked to three diseases including Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, which is characterized by osteoskeletal deformities, photosensitivity, and increased osteosarcoma susceptibility. Understanding regulation of RECQL4 helicase activity by interaction partners will allow deciphering its role as an enzyme and a signaling cofactor in different cellular contexts. We became interested in studying the interaction of RECQL4 with ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) because previous studies have shown that RPS3 activity is sometimes associated with phenotypes mimicking those of mutated RECQL4. RPS3 is a small ribosomal protein that also has extraribosomal functions, including apurnic-apyrimidinic endonuclease-like activity suggested to be important during DNA repair. Here, we report a functional and physical interaction between RPS3 and RECQL4 and show that this interaction may be enhanced during cellular stress. We show that RPS3 inhibits ATPase, DNA binding, and helicase activities of RECQL4 through their direct interaction. Further domain analysis shows that N-terminal 1-320 amino acids of RECQL4 directly interact with the C-terminal 94-244 amino acids of RPS3 (C-RPS3). Biochemical analysis of C-RPS3 revealed that it comprises a standalone apurnic-apyrimidinic endonuclease-like domain. We used U2OS cells to show that oxidative stress and UV exposure could enhance the interaction between nuclear RPS3 and RECQL4. Regulation of RECQL4 biochemical activities by RPS3 along with nuclear interaction during UV and oxidative stress may serve to modulate active DNA repair."

By computational and hypothesis driven approaches additional mutations enhancing the trans-sialidase activity have been suggested. In the present work, we made a systematic combination of these mutations leading to seven new variants of the T. rangeli sialidase, having 6–16 targeted amino acid mutations. The resulting enzyme variants were analyzed via kinetics for their ability to carry out trans-sialidase reaction using CGMP and D-lactose as substrates. The sialidase variants with 15 and 16 mutations, respectively, exhibited significantly improved trans-sialidase activity for D-lactose sialylation. Our results corroborate, that computational studies of trans-glycosylation can be a valuable input in the design of novel trans-glycosidases, but also highlight the importance of experimental validation in order to assess the performance. In conclusion, two of the seven mutants displayed a dramatic switch in specificity from hydrolysis towards trans-sialylation and constitute the most potent trans-sialidase mutants of TrSA described in literature to date."
https://openalex.org/W2583769406,"Seed dispersal permits the colonization of favorable habitats and generation of new populations, facilitating escape from habitats that are in decline. There is little experimental evidence of the factors that limit epiphyte dispersion towards their hosts. In a tropical dry forest in central Mexico, we monitored the phenology of dispersion of epiphyte species of the genus Tillandsia; we tested experimentally whether precipitation could cause failures in seed dispersal and whether seed capture differs among vertical strata and between host species with high (Bursera copallifera) and low (Conzattia multiflora) epiphyte loads. With the exception of one species that presents late dispersion and low abundance, all of the species disperse prior to the onset of the rainy season. However, early rains immobilize the seeds, affecting up to 24% of the fruits in species with late dispersion. We observed that Tillandsia seeds reach both Bursera and Conzattia hosts, but found that adherence to the host is 4–5 times higher in Bursera. Furthermore, seeds liberated from Bursera travel shorter distances and up to half may remain within the same crown, while the highest seed capture takes place in the upper strata of the trees. We conclude that dispersion of Tillandsia seeds is limited by early rains and by the capture of seeds within the trees where populations concentrate. This pattern of capture also helps to explain the high concentrations of epiphytes in certain hosts, while trees with few epiphytes can be simultaneously considered deficient receivers and efficient exporters of seeds."
https://openalex.org/W2585594141,"Th17 cells and their cytokines are linked to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation. Th17 development is initiated by combined signaling of TGF-β and IL-6 or IL-21, and can be reduced in the absence of either IL-6 or IL-21. The aim of this study was to assess whether combinatorial IL-6/IL-21 blockade would more potently inhibit Th17 development, and be more efficacious in treating arthritis than targeting either cytokine. We assessed in vitro Th17 differentiation efficacy in the absence of IL-6 and/or IL-21. To investigate in vivo effects of IL-6/IL-21 blockade on Th17 and arthritis development, antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was induced in IL-6-/- x IL-21R-/- mice. The therapeutic potential of this combined blocking strategy was assessed by treating mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) with anti-IL-6R antibodies and soluble (s)IL-21R.Fc. We demonstrated that combined IL-6/IL-21 blocking synergistically reduced in vitro Th17 differentiation. In mice with AIA, absence of IL-6 and IL-21 signaling more strongly reduced Th17 levels and resulted in stronger suppression of arthritis than the absence of either cytokine. Additionally, anti-IL-6/anti-IL-21 treatment of CIA mice during the arthritis induction phase reduced disease development more potent than IL-6 or IL-21 inhibition alone, as effective as anti-TNF treatment. Collectively, these results suggest dual IL-6/IL-21 inhibition may be a more efficacious therapeutic strategy compared to single cytokine blockade to suppress arthritis development."
https://openalex.org/W2587057091,"Despite decades of research in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling field, and many targeted anti-cancer drugs that have been tested clinically, the success rate for these agents in the clinic is low, particularly in terms of the improvement of overall survival. Intratumoral heterogeneity is proposed as a major mechanism underlying treatment failure of these molecule-targeted agents. Here we highlight the application of fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM)-based biosensing to demonstrate intratumoral heterogeneity of EGFR activity. For sensing EGFR activity in cells, we used a genetically encoded CrkII-based biosensor which undergoes conformational changes upon tyrosine-221 phosphorylation by EGFR. We transfected this biosensor into EGFR-positive tumour cells using targeted lipopolyplexes bearing EGFR-binding peptides at their surfaces. In a murine model of basal-like breast cancer, we demonstrated a significant degree of intratumoral heterogeneity in EGFR activity, as well as the pharmacodynamic effect of a radionuclide-labeled EGFR inhibitor in situ. Furthermore, a significant correlation between high EGFR activity in tumour cells and macrophage-tumour cell proximity was found to in part account for the intratumoral heterogeneity in EGFR activity observed. The same effect of macrophage infiltrate on EGFR activation was also seen in a colorectal cancer xenograft. In contrast, a non-small cell lung cancer xenograft expressing a constitutively active EGFR conformational mutant exhibited macrophage proximity-independent EGFR activity. Our study validates the use of this methodology to monitor therapeutic response in terms of EGFR activity. In addition, we found iNOS gene induction in macrophages that are cultured in tumour cell-conditioned media as well as an iNOS activity-dependent increase in EGFR activity in tumour cells. These findings point towards an immune microenvironment-mediated regulation that gives rise to the observed intratumoral heterogeneity of EGFR signalling activity in tumour cells in vivo."

In this study, we created fat-1 transgenic sheep, investigated the fine-mapping and the modulatory mechanisms of promoter methylation. Sheep fetal fibroblasts were transfected by pCAG-fat1-IRES-EGFP. Monoclonal cell line was screened as nuclear donor and carried out nuclear transfer (441 transgenic cloned embryos, 52 synchronism recipient sheep). Six offsprings were obtained. Expressions of exogenous genes fat-1 and EGFP were detectable in 10 examined tissues and upregulated omega-3 fatty acid content. Interestingly, more or less EGFP negative cells were detectable in the positive transgenic fetal skin cells. EGFP negative and positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry, and their methylation status in the whole promoter region (1701 nt) were investigated by bisulphate sequencing. The fine-mapping of methylation in CAG promoter were proposed. The results suggested that exogenous gene expression was determined by the methylation status from 721–1346 nt and modulated by methylation levels at 101, 108 and 115 nt sites in CAG promoter. To clarify the regulatory mechanism of methylation, examination of four DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) demonstrated that hypermethylation of CAG promoter is mainly maintained by DNMT 1 in EGFP negative cells. Furthermore, investigation of the cell surface antigen CD34, CD45 and CD166 indicated that EGFP positive and negative cells belong to different types. The present study systematically clarified methylation status of CAG promoter in transgenic sheep and regulatory mechanism, which will provide research strategies for gene expression regulation in transgenic animals."

The inhibition process relies on two factors specific to AHAS: (i) the requirement of a reduced FAD cofactor for the enzyme to be active and (ii) a characteristic slow rate of FAD reduction by the pyruvate oxidase side reaction of the enzyme. The mechanism of inhibition involves the oxidation of the FAD cofactor, leading to a time-dependent inhibition of AHAS correlated with the slow process of FAD re-reduction.

The unexplained conservation of this “vestigial” quinone binding site in all AHAS suggests the possibility of its involvement in a, yet undiscovered, physiological role (3.Schloss Schloss Ciskanik Ciskanik Vandyk Vandyk Origin of the herbicide binding site of acetolactate synthase.Nature. 1988; 331: 360-362Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Schloss (4.Schloss Schloss Acetolactate synthase.Chem. Biochem. Flavoenzymes. 1991; III: 531-542Google Scholar) has also shown that Q0 is able to oxidize the enzyme-bound FAD, a cofactor derived from a POX ancestor but without an assigned role in AHAS activity. Here, we demonstrate that (i) the reduction of the FAD cofactor is imperative to activate AHAS, and (ii) the inhibition of AHAS by uquinones is related to the oxidation of FAD. We propose that the existence and conservation of such a complex mechanism is testimony to the regulation of the BCAA synthetic pathway by the redox level of the environment. AHAS activity is characterized by a temperature-dependent lag phase requiring incubation with substrate before reaching maximal activity (5.Hwang Hwang Kim Kim Kim Kim Choi Choi Yoon Yoon Lag time of the recombinant acetohydroxy acid synthase from tobacco.Bull. Korean Chem. Soc. 2003; 24: 1856-1858Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Monitoring the ScAHAS activity at 333 nm (6.Schloss Schloss Van Dyk Van Dyk Vasta Vasta Kutny Kutny Purification and properties of Salmonella typhimurium acetolactate synthase isozyme-Ii from Escherichia coli Hb101/Pdu9.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4952-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and the absorbance of oxidized FAD (FADox) at 450 nm under identical assay conditions with a saturating concentration of pyruvate revealed that the concentration of enzyme-bound FADox decreases during the lag phase, FAD being fully reduced when the enzyme reaches steady-state activity (Fig. 2, A and B). The reduction of ScAHAS-bound FADox occurs in two phases. In the first phase, the reduction is rapid and involves around 25–30% of the total FAD. This phase could be attributed to the pre-existence of an enzyme-hydroxyethyl-ThDP complex allowing rapid reduction of FADox through a long-range electron transfer (7.Lonhienne Lonhienne Nouwens Nouwens Williams Williams Fraser Fraser Lee Lee West West Guddat Guddat Commercial herbicides can trigger the oxidative inactivation of acetohydroxyacid synthase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2016; 55: 4247-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the second phase, the FAD reduction rate is lower and follows an exponential decay. To assess the correlation between FAD reduction and enzyme activation during phase II (Fig. 2C), two equations were derived (see “Experimental Procedures” for equation derivation). [P]=kcat([Etot]t+([Etot]−[E0])(e−kobs(act)t−1kobs(act)))(Eq. 1) Equation 1, which represents the variation of the product concentration [P] as a function of time, where [Etot] represents the total concentration of enzyme, [E0] the concentration of enzyme that is initially activated during the rapid first phase of activation (Phase I, Fig. 2, A and C), kcat the catalytic constant, and kobs(act) the “observed” first-order rate of AHAS activation. The equation was used to fit the experimental curves, giving an average kobs(act) value of 0.122 ± 0.016 min−1 (S.E. of the mean of five measurements). A450=ξ1[FADtot]+(ξ2−ξ1)([FADtot]−[FAD0])(e−kobs(red)t)(Eq. 2) Equation 2, which represents the variation of the absorbance of FAD at 450 nm as a function of time, where [FADtot] represents the total concentration of enzyme-bound FAD, [FAD0] the concentration of FAD that is initially reduced during the rapid first phase of activation, ξ1 and ξ2, the (unknown) molar absorption coefficients at 450 nm of enzyme-bound reduced FAD (FADred) and FADox, and kobs(red) the observed first-order rate constant of FADox reduction. The equation was used to fit the experimental curves, yielding an average kobs(red) value of 0.120 ± 0.013 min−1 (S.E. of the mean of five measurements). Remarkably, the value of kobs(red) correlates very well with the value of kobs(act). The relationship between the enzyme activity and the redox status of enzyme-bound FAD is further demonstrated by the fact that addition of pyruvate to the reaction cuvette at the end of the first reaction where FAD has been fully reduced leads to a reaction velocity characterized by the absence of a lag phase (Fig. 2A). A good correlation between the rates of FAD reduction and enzyme activation was also observed for AHAS from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtAHAS, catalytic subunit ilvB1) (Fig. 3), suggesting that this feature is generic in AHASs and that a reduced FAD cofactor is imperative for AHAS activity. Considering the absorbance profile of reduced FAD is perturbed by the presence of pyruvate/acetolactate (Fig. 2B), it was not possible to determine which form of reduced FAD (FAD fully reduced or the semiquinone form) is present during steady-state catalysis. To eliminate the contributions of pyruvate/acetolactate in the UV-visible spectrum, an experiment was undertaken where the activated enzyme was rapidly purified on a desalting column. However, the result was not a spectrum typical of fully reduced or semiquinone FAD (Fig. 2D), suggesting the spectrum of reduced FAD is affected by the environment within the enzyme. Tittmann et al. (8.Tittmann Tittmann Schröder Schröder Golbik Golbik McCourt McCourt Kaplun Kaplun Duggleby Duggleby Barak Barak Chipman Chipman Hübner Hübner Electron transfer in acetohydroxy acid synthase as a side reaction of catalysis.

Importantly, Tittmann et al. (8.Tittmann Tittmann Schröder Schröder Golbik Golbik McCourt McCourt Kaplun Kaplun Duggleby Duggleby Barak Barak Chipman Chipman Hübner Hübner Electron transfer in acetohydroxy acid synthase as a side reaction of catalysis. Implications for the reactivity and partitioning of the carbanion/enamine form of (α-hydroxyethyl)thiamin diphosphate in a “nonredox” flavoenzyme.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8652-8661Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also found that FADred is very unreactive toward molecular oxygen, and this feature is indeed crucial to maintain the enzyme active in aerobic conditions. Consistent with FAD being catalytically reduced by pyruvate, the variation of kobs(act) as a function of the concentration of pyruvate follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km values of 24 and 90 mm for ScAHAS and MtAHAS, respectively (Fig. 4). The plateau of the curves corresponds to the catalytic rate constant (kact) of AHAS activation (POX activity), which has at 30 °C a value of 0.83 and 0.28 min−1 for ScAHAS and MtAHAS, respectively. These results imply that at physiological concentrations of pyruvate, the rate of FAD reduction (and enzyme activation) is expected to be slow (e.g. if [pyruvate] ≤ 1 mm, kobs(act) ≤ 0.003/0.04 min−1 (corresponding to a half-time of activation ≥230/17 min) for MtAHAS/ScAHAS at 30 °C). The seemingly low activation rate, especially for MtAHAS, could appear to be an obstacle for achieving full activity under physiological conditions because the half-life of AHAS could be quite short. It is known for example that ScAHAS has a half-life of 8.5 h (yeastmine.yeastgenome.org), but there is no equivalent data available for the Mt enzyme. There are also a number of other factors that could come into play in achieving high enzymatic activity within cell. These include the concentration of pyruvate, rate of protein synthesis, and the availability of the regulatory subunit. Further studies need to be performed to dissect the role of each factor in activating AHAS under the physiological conditions of the cell. To investigate the role of the FAD cofactor in AHAS inhibition by ubiquinones, 50 μm Q1 was reacted with MtAHAS and three events were monitored: (i) the activity of MtAHAS at 333 nm, (ii) the redox state of FAD cofactor at 450 nm, and (iii) the redox state of Q1 at 405 nm (spectral peak, Fig. 5A). MtAHAS inhibition by Q1 appears to be time-dependent (as reported for the inhibition of ALS1–3 by Q0 (3.Schloss Schloss Ciskanik Ciskanik Vandyk Vandyk Origin of the herbicide binding site of acetolactate synthase.Nature. 1988; 331: 360-362Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar)) and in correlation with the progressive oxidation of the FAD cofactor (Fig. 6A). The inhibition by Q1 is also associated with the reduction of Q1 (Fig. 6B), inferring that a redox reaction occurs between Q1 and FAD. When Q1 is fully reduced by addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), the enzyme recovers activity meaning that Q1 has the ability to inhibit AHAS activity only in its oxidized form. The recovery of the enzyme activity is slow and linked to the re-reduction of FAD (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that FAD oxidation by Q1 is the main driver of the inhibition process.FIGURE 6Inhibition of MtAHAS by Q1. A, progress curves for the inhibition of MtAHAS by Q1 monitored at 333 (pyruvate absorbance, upper curve) and 450 nm (intrinsic FAD absorbance, lower curve) under identical assay conditions. 7 μm MtAHAS was incubated with 100 mm pyruvate in standard buffer in the absence of free FAD at 25 °C. After reaching full activation (17 min), the inhibition reaction was initiated by adding 50 μm Q1 in the sample cell. After 7 min of incubation with Q1 associated with the oxidation of the FAD cofactor an the inhibition of MtAHAS activity by 80%, 1 mm DTT was added in the sample cell to reduce the remaining Q1, triggering the re-activation of the enzyme and re-reduction of FAD. Notably the progress curve at 450 nm not only monitors FAD reduction/oxidation, but also Q1 concentration (Fig. 5A), which is reflected by the absorbance jumps observed upon injection of Q1 and DTT (arrows). B, progress curves for the inhibition of MtAHAS by Q1 monitored at 333 (upper curve) and 405 nm (spectral peak of Q1 (Fig. 5A), lower curve) under identical assay conditions. 1.7 μm MtAHAS was incubated with 100 mm pyruvate in standard buffer in the absence of free FAD at 30 °C. After activation of MtAHAS (8 min), the inhibition reaction was initiated by adding 50 μm Q1 in the sample cell. After 11 min of incubation associated with the reduction of Q1, the inhibition of MtAHAS activity reached 74%. 1 mm DTT was then added in the sample cell to reduce the remaining Q1, allowing the re-activation of the enzyme. Due to the low concentration of MtAHAS in this experiment, the progress curve at 405 nm monitoring Q1 reduction was not significantly affected by the reduction/oxidation of the FAD cofactor. C, initial inhibition of MtAHAS as a function of Q1 concentration. 1.7 μm activated MtAHAS was incubated with different concentrations of Q1 (25–500 μm) and a calculation of the initial inhibition was performed, as illustrated in the inset where curves a, b, and c correspond to inhibition by 500, 50, and 0 μm Q1, respectively. The dotted lines represent linear regressions made with data collected during the initial 50 s of inhibition. The measurement of the initial inhibition was feasible only to Q1 concentrations ≤500 μm (”Experimental Procedures“). The data were fitted using Equation 3 yielding an estimated Ki value of 240 μm. D, scheme representing the mechanism of inhibition of AHAS by Q1. Eox/Ered represent the enzyme with oxidized/reduced FAD cofactor, pyr the pyruvate molecule, Q1red the reduced form of Q1, kact the rate constant of enzyme activation, and kox the rate constant of FAD oxidation by Q1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For ALS1–3, the initial inhibition by Q1 is weak and non-competitive (3.Schloss Schloss Ciskanik Ciskanik Vandyk Vandyk Origin of the herbicide binding site of acetolactate synthase.Nature. 1988; 331: 360-362Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here, the inhibition curves (Fig. 6, A and B) show that the initial inhibition of MtAHAS by 50 μm of Q1 is small, implying a weak affinity. The initial inhibition of 1.7 μm MtAHAS was determined for different concentrations of Q1 (25–500 μm, Fig. 6C) and the % of remaining activity was plotted against the concentration of Q1. The data were fitted with the equation for non-competitive inhibition, vi=vO/(1+[I]/Ki)(Eq. 3) yielding an estimated Ki value of 240 μm, comparable with those reported for the inhibition of ALS1–3 by Q1 (3.Schloss Schloss Ciskanik Ciskanik Vandyk Vandyk Origin of the herbicide binding site of acetolactate synthase.Nature. 1988; 331: 360-362Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The weak affinity of Q1 for MtAHAS implies that the inhibition relies mainly on two factors: (i) the rate at which Q1 oxidizes FAD and (ii) the rate of enzyme re-activation corresponding to the rate of FAD re-reduction by the POX side activity of AHAS. Both factors are responsible for the observed time dependence of the inhibition (Fig. 6, A and B). After some time, the inhibition curves show a stabilization of AHAS activity (Fig. 6, A–C), implying that an equilibrium is reached between the rate of FAD oxidation (kox × [Ered:Q1]) and the rate of AHAS re-activation (kact × [Eox:pyr]) (Fig. 6D). An estimated value of 4.7 min−1 was obtained for kox at 30 °C (“Experimental Procedures”). An evident deduction from the mechanism of inhibition by Q1 (Fig. 6D) is that Q1 will be a more potent inhibitor at low concentration of pyruvate, as the rate of AHAS re-activation decreases with decreasing pyruvate concentration (Fig. 4). This situation is illustrated by the inhibition of ScAHAS by Q1 at two different concentrations of pyruvate (Fig. 7) showing that 500 μm Q1 has no effect in the presence of 100 mm pyruvate, but almost fully inhibits the enzyme when the concentration of pyruvate decreases to 4 mm. Notably, the inhibition by Q1 is more effective with MtAHAS, compared with ScAHAS, and this can be at least partially explained by the fact that kact is significantly lower in MtAHAS (Fig. 4). The influence of the pyruvate concentration on the inhibition of AHAS by Q1 is a feature intimating that regulation of AHAS by the redox level of the environment is of physiological relevance. Indeed, a low redox level in the mitochondria/cell correlates with a low production of energy (Fig. 1). In this situation, if the concentration of pyruvate (precursor molecule for energy production) is low, the inhibition of the anabolic BCAA synthetic pathway is logical. However, a high concentration of pyruvate has the potential to rapidly increase the redox level and energy production required for an anabolic process (Fig. 1), and consistently, a reduction of the inhibitory potency of Q1 is observed in our experiments. Q0 has been shown to inhibit ALS1–3 and here we show that it also inhibits MtAHAS and Arabidopsis thaliana AHAS (AtAHAS) (Fig. 8, A and B), through a mechanism apparently similar to the one involved in inhibition by Q1. Here we also show that other aromatic molecules, different from ubiquinone, can inhibit AHAS. Menadione, an oxidized quinone derivative that serves as a redox mediator in Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.Green Green Paget Paget Bacterial redox sensors.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 954-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), inhibits MtAHAS in a similar fashion to Q0 and Q1 (Fig. 9). These results suggest that the regulation by oxidized soluble quinones is generic for AHAS from all organisms (bacteria, fungi, plants) and that different molecules can serve as redox signaling molecules, presumably specific to each kind of organism. Schloss (3.Schloss Schloss Ciskanik Ciskanik Vandyk Vandyk Origin of the herbicide binding site of acetolactate synthase.Nature. 1988; 331: 360-362Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar) has shown that Q0 and the commercial AHAS inhibiting herbicides compete for the same binding site. Here, docking studies confirm that Q1 fits neatly into the herbicide binding pocket (Fig. 10). The model suggests that electrons that are transferred from reduced FAD to Q1 could pass through the aromatic ring of Phe-201. The ring is 3.51 Å from the C7 carbon atom of FAD and 3.56 Å from the aromatic ring of Q1, distances that can be traversed by the electrons (10.Pang Pang Duggleby Duggleby Guddat Guddat Crystal structure of yeast acetohydroxyacid synthase: a target for herbicidal inhibitors.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Phe-201 can also serves as a relay for electrons transferred from hydroxyethyl-ThDP to FADox during the POX side reaction that activates the enzyme. This arrangement resembles that observed in Lactobacillus plantarum POX, where the transfer of two electrons from hydroxyethyl-ThDP to FADox occurs through the aromatic ring of a phenylalanine residue (Phe-121 or Phe-479) (11.Muller Muller Schulz Schulz Structure of the thiamine-dependent and flavin-dependent enzyme pyruvate oxidase.Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). As the soluble quinone derivatives and herbicides bind to the same pocket in AHAS, a comparison of their mode of inhibition is worthy of discussion. The major difference is that the herbicides have a high affinity (i.e. sulfonylureas have Ki values in the low nm range), whereas the quinones have a much weaker affinity (>100 μm, Ref. 3.Schloss Schloss Ciskanik Ciskanik Vandyk Vandyk Origin of the herbicide binding site of acetolactate synthase.Nature. 1988; 331: 360-362Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar and this study) for AHAS. The low affinity of quinones may reflect the need for AHAS to be able to accommodate different types of quinones and also to prevent the inhibition of AHAS by standard concentrations of quinones at normal physiological conditions. In contrast, herbicides have a high affinity for AHAS because they have been designed to maximally inhibit under all conditions. Another important aspect, which is different between the herbicides and quinones, is that herbicides are apparently not altered by interaction with AHAS, whereas the quinones are subject to modification (reduction by the enzyme-bound FADred) that renders the molecule ineffective for further inhibition. This is a crucial aspect in the regulation of AHAS activity by quinones as this feature would prevent the enzyme from being affected by small decreases of redox level that are not relevant physiologically. Indeed, the quinone reduction activity would allow AHAS to quickly re-establish normal redox conditions in the cell, restoring normal AHAS activity. Besides these differences, there is a commonality between quinones and the commercial herbicides in that their mode of inhibition is time-dependent and linked to oxidation of the FADred (7.Lonhienne Lonhienne Nouwens Nouwens Williams Williams Fraser Fraser Lee Lee West West Guddat Guddat Commercial herbicides can trigger the oxidative inactivation of acetohydroxyacid synthase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2016; 55: 4247-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms leading to this common phenomenon are unrelated. As shown here, the quinones directly oxidize FADred, whereas the herbicides stabilize a ThDP-peracetate intermediate derived from the inherent oxygenase side reaction of AHAS, 4T. Lonhienne, M. D. Garcia, and L. W. Guddat, unpublished data. ultimately leading to the release of reactive oxygen species (peracetate, singlet oxygen) that oxidizes FAD (7.Lonhienne Lonhienne Nouwens Nouwens Williams Williams Fraser Fraser Lee Lee West West Guddat Guddat Commercial herbicides can trigger the oxidative inactivation of acetohydroxyacid synthase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2016; 55: 4247-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the high potency of herbicides appears to be the consequence of a combination of exceptional circumstances, linked to the multiple reactions that can occur in the AHAS active and herbicide/quinone binding sites. Our results explain two subjects of conjecture, i.e. why AHAS has a highly conserved “ancestral” ubiquinone-binding site and also why it has retained its requirement for FAD (3.Schloss Schloss Ciskanik Ciskanik Vandyk Vandyk Origin of the herbicide binding site of acetolactate synthase.Nature. 1988; 331: 360-362Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 4.Schloss Schloss Acetolactate synthase.Chem. Biochem. Flavoenzymes. 1991; III: 531-542Google Scholar). It is because both features are an integral part of a mechanism of critical importance for the regulation of BCAA synthesis. In light of this research, it appears that this novel regulation pathway is at the core of the inhibitory activity of many of the commercial herbicides that target AHAS. The expression and purification of MtAHAS and ScAHAS was carried out in two steps as described previously (IMAC and gel filtration) (12.Pang Pang Guddat Guddat Duggleby Duggleby Crystallization of the catalytic subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae acetohydroxyacid synthase.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1321-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), however, with a modification: the gel-filtration purification step was performed on a Sephacryl S200 size exclusion FPLC column and Mt- or ScAHAS were eluted in buffer that contained 0.2 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 10 μm FAD. Using a Millipore Centricon with a 30-kDa cut-off, Mt- or ScAHAS was then concentrated to 35–64 mg/ml and aliquots were snap cooled at −80 °C. This process led to highly concentrated enzyme (480–870 μm) carrying the cofactor FAD, and giving an enzyme solution in which the ratio of enzyme-bound FAD versus free FAD is ≥40 in favor of the enzyme-bound FAD. The expression and purification of AtAHAS was carried as described previously (13.McCourt McCourt Pang Pang King-Scott King-Scott Guddat Guddat Duggleby Duggleby Herbicide-binding sites revealed in the structure of plant acetohydroxyacid synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined by using a Direct Detect spectrophotometer (Millipore). Enzyme assays were performed using a continuous spectrophotometric method measuring the disappearance of pyruvate (6.Schloss Schloss Van Dyk Van Dyk Vasta Vasta Kutny Kutny Purification and properties of Salmonella typhimurium acetolactate synthase isozyme-Ii from Escherichia coli Hb101/Pdu9.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4952-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or a colorimetric method (14.Singh Singh Stidham Stidham Shaner Shaner Assay of acetohydroxyacid synthase.Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The standard buffer contained 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm ThDP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm FAD. The concentration of pyruvate was variable and described in the text, under “Experimental Procedures,” or in the figure legends. ScAHAS activity was measured at 333 nm by the continuous spectrophotometric method, whereas reduction-oxidation of enzyme-bound FAD was monitored at 450 nm (intrinsic absorbance of FAD), under identical assay conditions. The assays were performed in standard buffer in the absence of free FAD to avoid interference with the enzyme-bound FAD. The first reaction involved the incubation of 9.5 μm ScAHAS with 100 mm pyruvate at 15 °C (total volume of 200 μl) for 36 min until full depletion of pyruvate occurred. A low temperature of 15 °C was chosen to increase the time of the lag phase and therefore to increase the accuracy of its analysis. The second reaction (Fig. 2A, arrow) was initiated by addition of 7 μl of a 3 m pyruvate stock solution (pyruvate dissolved in 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2) in the sample cell. The addition of a high pyruvate concentration ensured that the extra volume did not significantly alter the concentration of the enzyme in the sample cell. Two samples (samples 1 and 2) were analyzed. Sample 1 consisted of a 1-ml solution of 41 μm ScAHAS in standard buffer that did not include free FAD and pyruvate. Sample 2 consisted of a 1-ml solution of 41 μm ScAHAS (in standard buffer exempt of free FAD) incubated with 1.4 m pyruvate for 30 min at 15 °C. Note that the pH (7.2) was not affected by the high concentration of pyruvate. Spectrophotometric monitoring of the reaction occurring in sample 2 confirmed that after 30 min of reaction, ScAHAS was in steady-state activity and that the sample still contained significant concentration of pyruvate. Each sample was desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated at 5 °C with a buffer (50 mm KP, 1 mm ThDP, 10 mm Mg) de-oxygenated by N2 bubbling to minimize FAD re-oxidation during the desalting process. For sample 1, which was yellow (color of oxidized FAD), 10 of the most intensely yellow drops were collected (drops 44 to 53 after application of the 1-ml sample) and an absorbance spectrum was performed (PD-10 equilibration buffer used to establish the baseline). For sample 2, which was uncolored because FAD was reduced, the same drops (44 to 53) were collected and the absorbance spectrum was immediately performed. The concentration of enzyme in the samples after desalting was 27.5 (sample 1) and 23.8 μm (sample 2). The spectrum of sample 2 (Fig. 2D) was corrected to match the concentration in sample 1. 21.5 μm MtAHAS was incubated with 300 mm pyruvate at 30 °C. MtAHAS activity was measured by the continuous spectrophotometric method at 360 nm instead of the typical 333 nm to avoid absorbance saturation linked to the high concentration of pyruvate used in the assays. The equations were derived as follow. For the rate of AHAS activation, ∂[Eact]∂t=kobs(act)[Einact]=kobs(act)([Etot]−[Eact])(Eq. 4) where kobs(act) represents the first-order rate of AHAS activation observed at a pyruvate concentration specific to a particular experiment, and where [Etot], [Eact], and [Einact] represent the concentration of total enzyme, enzyme activated, and enzyme inactivated, respectively. Integration of Equation 4 gives, [Eact]=[Etot]−([Etot]−[E0])e−kobs(act)t(Eq. 5) where [E0] represents the concentration of ScAHAS that is initially activated during the rapid first phase of activation (Fig. 2). Note that for MtAHAS, [E0] = 0 as there is only one phase (Fig. 3). At saturating substrate conditions for the AHAS reaction, ∂[P]∂t=kcat[Eact]=kcat([Etot]−([Etot]−[E0])e−kobs(act)t)(Eq. 6) where [P] represents the product concentration. Integration of Equation 6 gives Equation 7. [P]=kcat([Etot]t+([Etot]−[E0])(e−kobs(act)t−1kobs(act)))(Eq. 7) Taking into account that the product (acetolactate) is the result of the condensation of two pyruvate molecules and that the extinction coefficient of pyruvate is 17.5 m−1 cm−1 at 333 nm, Equation 7 can be transformed as followed, A333=−0.000035kcat([Etot]t+([Etot]−[E0])(e−kobs(act)t−1kobs(act)))+C(Eq. 8) where A333 represents the absorbance of pyruvate and where the concentration of enzyme is given in micromolar. The raw data were fitted with Equation 8 using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The parameter Etot was known and fixed. kcat, E0, and kobs(act) were variable parameters. For the first-order rate of FAD reduction, ∂[FADred]∂t=kobs(red)[FADox]=kobs(red)([FADtot]−[FADred])(Eq. 9) where kobs(red) represent the observed first-order rate constant rate of FAD reduction and [FADtot], [FADred], and [FADox] represent the concentration of total enzyme-bound FAD, enzyme-bound reduced FAD, enzyme-bound oxidized FAD, respectively. Integration of Equation 9 gives [FADred]=[FADtot]−([FADtot]−[FAD)0])(e−kobs(red)t)(Eq. 10) where [FAD0] represents the concentration of FAD that is initially reduced during the rapid first phase of activation (Fig. 2). [FADox] is deduced from Equation 10. [FADox]=[FADtot]−[FADred]=([FADtot]−[FAD0])(e−kobs(red)t)(Eq. 11) The total absorbance at 450 nm is represented by, A450=ξ1[FADred]+ξ2[FADox](Eq. 12) where ξ1 and ξ2 represent the (unknown) absorption coefficients at 450 nm of enzyme-bound FADred and FADox. Using Equations 10 and 11, Equation 12 was transformed to, A450=ξ1[FADtot]+(ξ2−ξ1)([FADtot]−[FAD0])(e−kobs(red)t)(Eq. 13) or A450=C1+C2(e−kobs(red)t)(Eq. 14) where C1 and C2 represent constants equal to ξ1[FADtot] and (ξ2 − ξ1)([FADtot] − [FAD0]), respectively. The raw data were fitted with Equation 14 using GraphPad Prism 6.0. C1, C2, and kobs(red) were variable parameters. The continuous spectrophotometric method was used for this experiment. The kinetic assays were performed at 30 °C, in the standard buffer containing different concentrations of pyruvate. At all concentrations of pyruvate tested (10–400 mm), the concentration of the enzyme was optimized to have less than 10–15% of the pyruvate consumed during the assay. At high concentrations of pyruvate (100–400 mm), the value of the absorption wavelength was increased (350, 360, or 370 nm) to avoid saturation. This does not affect the calculation of the rate of enzyme activation. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, kobs(act)=kact[Pyr][Pyr]+KM(Eq. 15) where kobs(act) represents the observed rate of AHAS activation, kact the catalytic rate constant of AHAS activation, and [pyr] the concentration of pyruvate. 7 μm MtAHAS was incubated with 100 mm pyruvate in standard buffer in the absence of FAD at 25 °C (in a total volume of 198 μl in a Quartz cuvette) for 17 min to allow the full activation of the enzyme to occur. 2 μl of a solution of 5 mm Q1 (diluted in DMSO) was then added in the cuvette resulting in a concentration of 50 μm Q1. We verified that 1% DMSO did not significantly affect AHAS activity. After 7 min of incubation with Q1, 2 μl of a solution of 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was added, reaching a final concentration of 1 mm able to fully reduce Q1 (Fig. 5A). The experiment was similar to the one mentioned above except for the concentration of MtAHAS (1.7 μm) and the temperature (30 °C). 1.7 μm MtAHAS was incubated with 100 mm pyruvate in standard buffer at 30 °C, ensuring saturation by the substrate. After 8 min of incubation allowing almost full activation of the enzyme, various concentrations of Q1 (25 to 500 μm) were added and a linear regression calculation was performed with the data corresponding to the initial 50 s of the inhibition curve (see inset of Fig. 6C). The initial activity rates were plotted versus the concentration of Q1 and the curve was fitted with the equation for non-competitive inhibition. vi=vo/(1+[I]/Ki)(Eq. 16) Due to the rapid increase of inhibition with time, it was not possible to assess the initial inhibition at concentrations of Q1 higher than 500 μm. ScAHAS activity was measured using the colorimetric method. 60/30 nm ScAHAS was incubated with 4/100 mm pyruvate in standard buffer at 30 °C in a total volume of 2.46 ml. During the entire inhibition assay, 80-μl aliquots were taken every 2 min and added to an Eppendorf tube containing 14 μl of 50% H2SO4 (v/v) to stop the reaction and have a H2SO4 concentration adequate for the colorimetric assay (see below). After 11 min of incubation, 20 μl of a solution of 50 mm Q1 was added to the sample (remaining volume of 1.98 ml after 6 samplings of 80 μl), yielding a final concentration of 500 μm. Only for the sample that initially contained 4 mm pyruvate: after 16 min of incubation with Q1 (and a remaining sample volume of 1.36 ml), 7 μl of a solution of 1 m DTT was added (final concentration of ∼5 mm DTT) to reduce the remaining Q1. The colorimetric assay was performed as follow: the aliquots sampled during the reaction and treated with H2SO4 (see above) were incubated at 60 °C for 15 min (formation of acetoin). Then, 100 μl of creatine (0.5% w/v) and 100 μl of α-naphthol (diluted in 4 m NaOH, 5% w/v) was added and samples were further incubated at 60 °C for 15 min (color development). 200 μl of the samples were transferred in a 96-well plate and absorbance was measured at 525 nm. Note that full catalytic conversion of 4 mm pyruvate to acetolactate leads to an absorbance ∼10 AU in the same conditions, meaning that less than 20% pyruvate was consumed during the inhibition experiment (Fig. 7). MtAHAS activity was measured using the colorimetric method. 250 nm MtAHAS was incubated with 5 mm pyruvate in standard buffer at 30 °C in a total volume of 3 ml. During the entire inhibition assay, 80-μl aliquots were taken every minute and added to an Eppendorf tube containing 14 μl of 50% H2SO4 (v/v). After 12.5 min of incubation, 8 μl of a solution of 5 mm of menadione (dissolved in DMSO) was added to the sample (having a remaining volume of 1.96 ml after 13 samplings of 80 μl), yielding a final concentration of 20 μm. After 12 min of incubation with menadione (remaining volume of the sample was 1 ml), 10 μl of a solution of 100 mm DTT was added (final concentration of 1 mm DTT) to reduce the remaining menadione. The colorimetric assay was performed as described above. The slope of the linear part of the inhibition curve (steady-state inhibition) obtained when 1.7 μm MtAHAS is inhibited by 50 μm Q1 (Fig. 6B) and is −0.01443 AU/min, which represents 74% inhibition as the velocity before adding Q1 is −0.055 AU/min. This can be interpreted as 26% of the enzyme being reduced and 74% being oxidized. As the estimated Km of Q1 is 240 μm, it can be deduced that 17% of enzyme binds Q1 when its concentration is 50 μm. Therefore, at equilibrium, (kox × 0.17 × 26) = (kact × 74). Because kact of MtAHAS is equal to 0.28 min−1 (at the same experimental temperature (30 °C), Fig. 4), the value of kox is estimated to be 4.7 min−1 at 30 °C. The ScAHAS-Q1 complex was obtained by molecular docking simulation of Q1 in the crystal structure of ScAHAS in complex with BSM (PDB code 5FEM) using the ChemPLP fitness of GOLD (15.Jones Jones Willett Willett Glen Glen Leach Leach Taylor Taylor Development and validation of a genetic algorithm for flexible docking.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5378) Google Scholar). The pose of Q1 in the binding pocket was selected according to the best score value function of ChemPLP and the binding free energy changes (ΔG). The structure refinement and energy minimization of the ScAHAS-Q1 complex was calculated with the YASARA Energy Minimization Server (16.Krieger Krieger Joo Joo Lee Lee Lee Lee Raman Raman Thompson Thompson Tyka Tyka Baker Baker Karplus Karplus Improving physical realism, stereochemistry, and side-chain accuracy in homology modeling: four approaches that performed well in CASP8.Proteins. 2009; 77: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar).

Thus, understanding the mechanisms responsible for substrate selection by kinases and phosphatases is central to our ability to model signal transduction at a system level. Classical protein-tyrosine phosphatases can exhibit substrate specificity in vivo by combining intrinsic enzymatic specificity with the network of protein-protein interactions, which positions the enzymes in close proximity to their substrates. Here we use a high throughput approach, based on high density phosphopeptide chips, to determine the in vitro substrate preference of 16 members of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family. This approach helped identify one residue in the substrate binding pocket of the phosphatase domain that confers specificity for phosphopeptides in a specific sequence context. We also present a Bayesian model that combines intrinsic enzymatic specificity and interaction information in the context of the human protein interaction network to infer new phosphatase substrates at the proteome level.

https://openalex.org/W2585159138,"To investigate the factors associated with sexually transmitted infection and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (STI-HIV) co-infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). A total of 357 HIV-infected participants (84 STI-HIV co-infection and 273 HIV infections only) were recruited from Jiangsu, China. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the related factors associated with STI-HIV co-infection. Marginal structural models were adopted to estimate the effect of transmission drug resistance (TDR) on STI-HIV co-infection. For all participants, logistic regression analyses revealed that those who diagnosed with HIV-1 for longer duration (≥1.8 years) were significantly associated with reduced STI-HIV co-infection risk (OR = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.32-0.96, P = 0.036). In further stratification analysis by antiretroviral therapy (ART), individuals with longer duration showed consistent significant associations with STI-HIV co-infection risk (OR = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.26-0.83, P = 0.010) among MSM with ART-naïve status. In addition, significant reduced risk for STI-HIV co-infection (OR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.96-0.99, P = 0.010) were observed in younger (under the average age of 31.03) MSM of the same group. Interestingly, we also found TDR was significantly associated with an increased risk of STI-HIV co-infection risk (OR = 3.84, 95%CI: 1.05-14.03, P = 0.042) in ART-naïve group. Our study highlights a pattern of STI-HIV co-infection among MSM in China and indicates that targeted interventions aimed at encouraging TDR monitoring in MSM with early HIV infection are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2585257673,"Previous literature has shown that vehicle crash risks increases as drivers’ off-road glance duration increases. Many factors influence drivers’ glance duration such as individual differences, driving environment, or task characteristics. Theories and past studies suggest that glance duration increases as the task progresses, but the exact relationship between glance sequence and glance durations is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of glance sequence on glance duration among drivers completing a visual-manual radio tuning task and an auditory-vocal based multi-modal navigation entry task. Eighty participants drove a vehicle on urban highways while completing radio tuning and navigation entry tasks. Forty participants drove under an experimental protocol that required three button presses followed by rotation of a tuning knob to complete the radio tuning task while the other forty participants completed the task with one less button press. Multiple statistical analyses were conducted to measure the effect of glance sequence on glance duration. Results showed that across both tasks and a variety of statistical tests, glance sequence had inconsistent effects on glance duration—the effects varied according to the number of glances, task type, and data set that was being evaluated. Results suggest that other aspects of the task as well as interface design effect glance duration and should be considered in the context of examining driver attention or lack thereof. All in all, interface design and task characteristics have a more influential impact on glance duration than glance sequence, suggesting that classical design considerations impacting driver attention, such as the size and location of buttons, remain fundamental in designing in-vehicle interfaces."
