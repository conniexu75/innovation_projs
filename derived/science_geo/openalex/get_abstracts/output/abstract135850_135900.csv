The synthesis of at least 115 proteins is stimulated by H2O2, whereas 52 other proteins are repressed by this treatment. We have identified 71 of the stimulated and 44 of the repressed targets. The kinetics and dose-response parameters of the H2O2 genomic response were also analyzed. Identification of these proteins and their mapping into specific cellular processes give a distinct picture of the way in which yeast cells adapt to oxidative stress. As expected, H2O2-responsive targets include an important number of heat shock proteins and proteins with reactive oxygen intermediate scavenging activities. Exposure to H2O2 also results in a slowdown of protein biosynthetic processes and a stimulation of protein degradation pathways. Finally, the most remarkable result inferred from this study is the resetting of carbohydrate metabolism minutes after the exposure to H2O2. Carbohydrate fluxes are redirected to the regeneration of NADPH at the expense of glycolysis. This study represents the first genome-wide characterization of a H2O2-inducible stimulon in a eukaryote.

Aerobic organisms have to maintain a reduced cellular redox environment in the face of the prooxidative conditions characteristic of aerobic life. The incomplete reduction of oxygen to water during respiration leads to the formation of redox-active oxygen intermediates (ROI) 1The abbreviations used are: ROIredox-active oxygen intermediateRTreverse transcriptionPCRpolymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are: ROIredox-active oxygen intermediateRTreverse transcriptionPCRpolymerase chain reaction. such as the superoxide anion radical (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (OH⋅) (for review, see Refs. 1Halliwell B.

ROI are also produced during the β-oxidation of fatty acids, and upon exposure to radiation, light, metals, and redox active drugs. Oxidative stress results from abnormally high levels of ROI which perturb the cell redox status and leads to damage to lipids, proteins, DNA, and eventually cell death. Living organisms constantly sense and adapt to such redox perturbations by the induction of batteries of genes or stimulons whose products act to maintain the cellular redox environment (4Crawford D.R. Davis K.J.A. Environ. Heath Perspect. 1994; 102: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, two distinct stimulons exist, one for H2O2 and the other for O⨪2, each consisting of a set of 30–40 proteins (for review, see Refs. 2Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Farr S.B. Ames B.N.

The genes encoding nine of the H2O2-inducible proteins are controlled by the transcriptional regulator OxyR and include katG (catalase),ahpCF (an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase), gorA(glutathione reductase), and dps (a nonspecific DNA binding protein). The genes encoding nine of the O⨪2-inducible proteins are controlled by the SoxR/S transcriptional regulators and includesodA (manganese superoxide dismutase), zwf1(glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), nfo (DNA repair exonuclease IV), fumC (fumarase C), and micF (an antisense RNA regulator). Most of the remaining proteins of these stimulons are unknown, but their identification would increase our understanding of the mechanisms of cellular redox control and ROI metabolism. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can also adapt to both H2O2- and O⨪2-generating drugs (7Flattery-O'Brien J. Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen.

Yeast has the same defense mechanisms as higher eukaryotes (for review, see Refs. 11Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv.

It therefore represents an ideal eukaryotic model in which to study the cellular redox control and ROI metabolism. redox-active oxygen intermediate reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. redox-active oxygen intermediate reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We recently established a general method to identify yeast proteins based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (13Maillet I. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10263-10270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We used this genome-wide experimental approach to characterize proteins whose expression is altered upon exposure to low doses of H2O2. Such an oxidative stress challenge results in a dramatic genomic response involving at least 167 proteins. Identification of these proteins and their mapping into cellular processes give a global view of the ubiquitous cellular changes elicited by H2O2 and provides the framework for understanding the mechanisms of cellular redox homeostasis and H2O2 metabolism. The yeast strain YPH98 (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (MAT a ura3-52lys2-801 amber ade2-101 ochre trp1-Δ1 leu2-Δ1) was used for the analysis of the H2O2 response. The strain S288C (15Mortimer R.K. Johnston J.R. Genetics. 1986; 113: 35-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for protein spot identification. Strains were grown at 30 °C in a medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose, buffered to pH 5.8 with 1% succinate and 0.6% NaOH. For YPH98, uracil, adenine, lysine, tryptophan and leucine (30 mg/liter) were added to the culture medium. All the 32 new protein identifications were performed in the S288C strain background. Of these, three were identified by a peptide mass mapping approach using matrix-assisted laser desorption isonization-time of flight/mass spectrometry (16Shevshenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7785) Google Scholar). The remaining 29 were identified by the method described in Maillet et al. (13Maillet I. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10263-10270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This method is based on the determination of the amino acid composition of a given protein by a double amino acid labeling technique with 35S and 3H as radioactive markers. The isotopic ratio determined for several pairs of amino acids together with the mass and the pI of a given spot is informative enough to find the corresponding open reading frame in a yeast data base containing 2700 protein sequences of codon bias index >0.1 with the help of a specific algorithm program. Eight different double labelings were performed here: 35S-Met/3H-Leu,35S-Met/3H-Lys,35S-Met/3H-Phe,35S-Met/3H-Tyr,35S-Met/3H-Trp,35S-Met/3H-His,35S-Cys/3H-Leu and35S-Cys/3H-His. We analyzed 260 spots out of which 124 already identified spots were used as internal standards for the establishment of calibration curves. Six of these 124 proteins devoid of Cys (Ssc1p, Pgi1p, Hsp12p, Hsp82p, Hsc82p, and Cys3p) were used to estimate the metabolic interconversion of Cys to Met which is about 15%. Reciprocally, two proteins devoid of Met (Tpi1p and Tsa1p) were used to estimate the interconversion from Met to Cys which is about 33%. 3H-Labeled amino acids were chosen among those which are not metabolized into other amino acids in our culture conditions (13Maillet I. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10263-10270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The isotopic ratio obtained for the 124 reference proteins were plotted against their known amino acid ratios taking into account Met and Cys interconversion. Experimental values were in good agreement with the theorical amino acid ratios. The standard deviation of this analysis ranged from 5 to 18%, depending on the double labeling. These calibration curves were used to determine the 8 amino acid ratios for the other 136 proteins analyzed. Mid-log cells (A600, 0.3) were exposed to H2O2 (0.4 mm) att = 0. 2 ml of treated or untreated cultures were then labeled with 500 μCi of [35S]methionine att = 15 min and collected at t = 30 min.35S-Labeled cultures were mixed to an equal aliquot of an3H-labeled culture just before lysis. This served as an internal standard to correct for any variation in protein yield not attributable to H2O2. 3H-Labeled cells were obtained by labeling exponentially growing cells (A600, 0.3) with [3H]methionine and [3H]leucine for 2 h. Mixtures were then extracted and processed for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously (13Maillet I. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10263-10270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Gels were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, dried, and exposed to autoradiography. The more abundant protein spots were numbered, identified on the dried gel, and extracted for counting 35S and 3H emission in a scintillation counter (WALLAC 1409). The 35S/3H ratio of each spot normalized to the 35S/3H Act1p ratio defines the protein synthesis rate index. The ratio of induced to control synthesis rate indexes defines the stimulation (or repression) index. The accuracy of this procedure was demonstrated by comparing two identical uninduced cultures which yielded almost identical results for 400 spots analyzed (S.D. = 0.10). The levels of 111 proteins which differed by a factor of 1.5 or more between uninduced and induced conditions are reported under “Results.” The 233 other analyzed protein spots did not significantly change their expression level upon H2O2 treatment. Among them, 110 proteins were identified on our two-dimensional maps: ABP1, ACO2, ACT1, ACT2, ADE1, ADH3, ADK1, APA1, ASN2, ATP14, VMA2, BMH1, BMH2, CCT5, CCT6, CLC1, CMD1, COF1, COR1, CPR1, CPR6, CPR7, CYS4, DAL1, DYS1, EGD1, EGD2, ERG1, FBA1, FRS1, FUM1, GLN1, GND1, GRS1, GSP1, HOM2, HOM6, HSP60, HXK1, HXK2, IDH2, IPP1, KAR2, KRS1, LEU1, LEU2, LPA13, MAS1, MET25, MRP8, NPL3, NTF2, PFK1, PFK2, PFY1, PGI1, PGK1, PRE2, PRE6, PRS4, PSA1, PUB1, PYK1, RBK1, RIB4, RPL1, RPLA3, RPS25A, SBP1, SEC14, SER1, SRP1, SSA4, SSC1, SSE1, SSE2, SUP45, TFP1, TIF11, TIF45, TOM40, TPI1, TPM1, TRP5, TUB2, UBC4, UBC6, UGA1, VMA2, VMA4, YDL100C, YDL161W, YEL047C, YEL071W, YFR044C, YGL245W, YGR012W, YHR064C, YJL068C, YJR105W, YLR192C, YLR206W, YLR301W, YMR116C, YMR120C, YOR007C, YOR230W, YOR280C, YPL088W, YRB1. A mid log culture (A600, 0.3) was treated at t = 0 with H2O2 (0.2 mm). Aliquots were then taken at t = 1, 2, 7, 11, 19, 36, and 59 min, labeled with 500 μCi of [35S]methionine for 2 min, and then collected, mixed with 3H-labeled cells, and processed as above. Given the 2-min duration of the [35S]methionine pulse, the kinetics experiments corresponded to times 0, 2, 3, 8, 12, 20, 37, and 60 min. For the dose-response analysis, mid log cell cultures (A600, 0.3) were treated att = 0 with 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mmH2O2. Cells were then labeled with 500 μCi of [35S]methionine at t = 15 min, collected at t = 30 min, and processed for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described above. Exponentially growing cells (A600, 0.3) were exposed to H2O2 (0.2 mm) at t = 0 and collected for mRNA preparation att = 0, 15, and 60 min. Cells were disrupted with an Eaton press, and mRNA were extracted with Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). mRNA levels were also quantified by a mutiplex RT-PCR strategy based on coamplification of specific internal fragments from selected genes using a combination of primers with similar Tm and designed to produce different fragment lengths to be resolved on a 4% acrylamide gel. Poly(A)+ mRNA were prepared with the poly(A) tract kit (Amersham Promega Biotech). Double-stranded cDNA libraries were generated from poly(A)+ messages with the Life Technologies, Inc. Superscript kit. These cDNA libraries were used in an RT-PCR reaction with appropriate primers and [33P]dCTP. The labeled RT-PCR products were then resolved by electrophoresis. Gels were dried, exposed to autoradiography, and quantified by phosphor technology (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics). ACT1 RT-PCR products were used as internal standard. All these PCR reactions were in the linear range as attested by comparison to preliminary calibration experiments. The exposure of exponentially growing cells to low doses of H2O2 results in dramatic changes in protein synthesis. To characterize this oxidative stress genomic response, exponentially growing cells were treated with 0.4 mm H2O2 for 15 min and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine. Labeled extracts from control untreated and treated cells were then subjected to comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig.1). Changes in the intensity of a number of spots could be recognized by simple visual inspection. We sought to precisely measure these genomic changes. Usual methods rely on the comparative quantification of corresponding 35S-labeled protein spots with a PhosphorImager. However, this method is imprecise at least in part due to differences in the yields of extraction of each protein. To improve this method, we defined an internal protein concentration standard for each spot by adding an equal aliquot of3H-labeled cells to the 35S-labeled cultures. This allows one to express any change in the rate of protein synthesis as the ratio between the 35S/3H ratios of corresponding spots from two different gels and hence to correct for any variation not related to the H2O2 treatment (see “Materials and Methods”). Preliminary experiments comparing two-dimensional gels from two identical cultures showed that the variations observed in the protein quantitation were below a factor of 1.3 for 96% of the 400 control spots analyzed and never exceeded 1.5 (Fig. 2). Therefore, differences by a factor greater than 1.5 between treated and control cultures were considered to be significant. Accordingly, 115 proteins were specifically induced by H2O2 with a stimulation index ranging from 1.5 to 20 (see TableI). Conversely, 52 other proteins were repressed with a repression index ranging from 0.65 to 0.15 (Table I). Almost identical results were observed with two related yeast strains S288C and YPH98.Figure 2Histogram indicating the distribution of the changes in synthesis rate index for 400 proteins. The synthesis rate index was calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” White bars, differences observed in the synthesis rate index of 400 proteins in duplicate experiments performed in identical conditions with extracts from control untreated cultures. These differences actually reflect the experimental error associated with the procedure.

Open table in a new tab The identity of 71 of the 115 proteins induced by H2O2 is given in Table I along with their stimulation index. 39 of them were previously identified on two-dimensional maps (for review, see Ref.17Boucherie H. Sagliocco F. Joubert R. Maillet I. Labarre J. Perrot M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1683-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 32 other spots were identified in this work by amino acid analysis as described by Maillet et al. (13Maillet I. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10263-10270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or by mass spectrometry (16Shevshenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7785) Google Scholar). H2O2-responsive proteins were sorted into seven different functional classes (see Table I). (i) Proteins directly related to the cellular antioxidant defense: This class shows a high stimulation index which ranges from 3 to 20 depending on the protein. It comprises the major oxidant scavenging enzymes cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp1p), cytosolic catalase (Ctt1p), Cu/Zn and Mn superoxide dismutases (Sod1p and Sod2p), thioperoxidase (Tsa1p), thioredoxin (Trx1p or Trx2p), NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase (Trr1p), and glutathione reductase (Glr1p). Four newly identified proteins were included in this functional class on the basis of their homology to known oxidant scavenging enzymes and/or suspected antioxidant defense properties. YDR453Cp is one of the two other AhpC/TSA family members identified in the yeast genome. YCL035Cp is 86% similar and 68% identical to TTR1-encoded glutaredoxin (thioltransferase). YLR109Wp and YOL151Wp were classified here on the basis of their role in the tolerance to tert-butyl hydroperoxide and diamide, respectively (see “Discussion”). (ii) Heat shock proteins: This class also shows a strong stimulation index for several of its members. (iii) Proteases and proteasome subunits: The stimulation index is significant but not as high as in the two previous classes. (iv) Translation apparatus components: This class contains only two H2O2-inducible proteins but several H2O2-repressed targets (see below). (v) Carbohydrate metabolism enzymes. (vi) Enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism. (vii) Unclassified proteins and open reading frames of unknown function: These include two putative regulators, Cdc37p and Mpr1p. MPR1 is the S. cerevisiae homologue ofSchizosaccharomyces pombe Pad1+, a global positive regulator of transcription implicated in chromatin structure and identified as a positive regulator of Pap1p, the S. pombe homologue of Yap1p (18Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yanagida M. Toda T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 569-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc37p has been shown to be a chaperone acting with Hsp90p and other chaperones to promote the folding/activity of a series of kinases (19Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). 44 out of these 52 proteins had been previously identified on two-dimensional maps (17Boucherie H. Sagliocco F. Joubert R. Maillet I. Labarre J. Perrot M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1683-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Each was assigned a repression factor and sorted into functional classes (Table I). Most of these proteins are translational apparatus components and metabolic enzymes. They include the translation initiation factors eIF4A (Tif1p) and eIF5A (Tif51Ap) and the translation elongation factors EF1-β (Efb1p), EF-2 (Eft1p), and EF-3 (Yef3p), which are dramatically repressed. Rpa0p, Rpa2p, Rpa4p, and Rps5p are acidic ribosomal proteins that act both at the initiation and the elongation steps (20Ramacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Bermejo B. Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Guarinos E.

Ssb1p and Ssb2p are heat shock proteins of the 70-kDa superfamily that are ribosomal-associated and have a role in the folding of nascent polypeptides emanating from the ribosome (21Craig E.A.

Metabolic enzymes repressed by H2O2include enzymes involved in glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, purine and amino acid biosynthesis, sulfur metabolism,S-adenosylmethionine, and polyamine biosynthesis. Ilv2p(a) (acetolactate synthase) appears repressed by a factor of 0.35. Interestingly, we could identify a H2O2-responsive spot of pI 6.7 andMr 67,000 with a very good match with Ilv2p with regard to its amino acid composition, and therefore it is indicated as Ilv2p(b) in Fig. 1 (13Maillet I.

However, some recent studies on Gpx1 knockout (−/−) mice have failed to show a role for Gpx1 under conditions of oxidative stress such as hyperbaric oxygen and the exposure of eye lenses to high levels of H2O2. These findings have, unexpectedly, raised the issue of the role of Gpx1, especially under conditions of oxidative stress. Here we demonstrate a role for Gpx1 in protection against oxidative stress by showing that Gpx1 (−/−) mice are highly sensitive to the oxidant paraquat. Lethality was already detected within 24 h in mice exposed to paraquat at 10 mg·kg−1 (approximately 17 the LD50of wild-type controls). The effects of paraquat were dose-related. In the 30 mg·kg−1-treated group, 100% of mice died within 5 h, whereas the controls showed no evidence of toxicity. We further demonstrate that paraquat transcriptionally up-regulatesGpx1 in normal cells, reinforcing a role forGpx1 in protection against paraquat toxicity. Finally, we show that cortical neurons from Gpx1 (−/−) mice are more susceptible to H2O2; 30% of neurons fromGpx1 (−/−) mice were killed when exposed to 65 μm H2O2, whereas the wild-type controls were unaffected. These data establish a function for Gpx1 in protection against some oxidative stressors and in protection of neurons against H2O2. Further, they emphasize the need to elucidate the role of Gpx1 in protection against different oxidative stressors and in different disease states and suggest thatGpx1 (−/−) mice may be valuable for studying the role of H2O2 in neurodegenerative disorders.

Reactive oxygen species (such as singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals) are highly reactive molecules produced during the course of normal cellular processes involving oxygen (1Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D.

These strong oxidants have the potential to create situations of oxidative stress within cells by reacting with macromolecules and causing damage such as mutations in DNA, destruction of protein function and structure, and peroxidation of lipids (3Halliwell B.

In order to protect against such harmful reactive intermediates, aerobic organisms have developed a number of cellular defenses. These include the antioxidant enzymes, namely superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases and catalase (1Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 412-426PubMed Google Scholar, 5Halliwell B.

Recently, a new member, Gpx5, has been added to the Gpx family. This Gpx, which is specifically expressed in mouse epididymis, is interestingly selenium-independent (16Ghyselinck N.B. Dufaure I.

Despite the well known ability of glutathione peroxidases to remove hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxides, the exact role of these enzymes under physiological and oxidative stress conditions is still not clearly defined. For many years, there has been controversy regarding the primary role of these enzymes. While several authors supported the notion that these enzymes play a major role in the protection against oxidative damage under normal physiological conditions (18Nicholls P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 279: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Jones D.P. Eklow L. Thor H. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem.

Recent studies using knockout mice as a model have provided unexpected data about the function of the most abundant glutathione peroxidase, Gpx1. Mice deficient in Gpx1 are healthy and fertile and do not show any histopathologies up to 15 months of age, thus suggesting a limited role for Gpx1 during normal development and under physiological conditions (24Ho Y.-S.

Ross D.A. Valentine B.A. Combs G.F. Lei X.G. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). More intriguingly, however, Gpx1 knockout mice display no abnormalities when exposed to an oxidative stressor such as hyperbaric oxygen (24Ho Y.-S. Magnetat J.-L. Bronson R.T. Cao J. Gargano M. Sugawara M. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Furthermore, even though Reddy et al. (26Reddy V.N. Lin L.R. Ho Y.S. Magnenat J.L. Ibaraki N. Giblin F.L. Dang L. Ophthalmologica. 1997; 211: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were able to show in vitro that lenses from Gpx1knockout mice exposed to low concentrations of H2O2 displayed evidence of abnormalities, Spector et al. (27Spector A. Yang Y. Ho Y.S. Magnenat J.L. Wang R.R. Ma W. Li W.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 521-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Spector A. Ma W. Wang R.R. Yang Y. Ho Y.S. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) found that lenses fromGpx1 (−/−) mice exposed to high levels of H2O2 (also in vitro) were not significantly different from those of wild-type mice. These latter data were interpreted as providing evidence that Gpx1 was dispensable even under conditions of oxidative stress, since catalase and glutathione were the functional molecules that detoxified H2O2. Therefore, the aforementioned studies (24Ho Y.-S. Magnetat J.-L. Bronson R.T. Cao J. Gargano M. Sugawara M. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 27Spector A. Yang Y. Ho Y.S. Magnenat J.L. Wang R.R. Ma W. Li W.C. Exp.

Eye Res. 1997; 64: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggest, somewhat surprisingly, a limited role for this enzyme under situations of oxidative stress. Cheng et al. (25Cheng W.H. Ho Y.S. Ross D.A. Valentine B.A. Combs G.F. Lei X.G. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have also shown that the knockout of the Gpx1 gene does not render the mice more susceptible to dietary, selenium, and vitamin E deficiencies and concluded that further studies on delineating the role of Gpx1 should employ more sensitive assays and more direct oxidative stresses. In an attempt to further clarify the antioxidant role of Gpx1, we have investigated the susceptibility of our Gpx1 knockout mice to other oxidative challenges. Our data show that Gpx1 functions in the cellular protection against oxidative stress induced by paraquat as well as in the protection of neurons against hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, our results suggest that the protective role conferred by Gpx1 against paraquat toxicity is mediated, partly at least, via an increase in transcriptional activity induced by this agent. A mouse 129/SVJ bacteriophage FIX II genomic library (Stratagene) was screened by hybridization with a Gpx1genomic probe (29de Haan J.B. Newman J.D. Kola I. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 13: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to obtain a 5.2-kb SacI fragment that contained the entire mouse Gpx1 genomic sequence (confirmed by hybridization and restriction mapping analysis; data not shown). A neomycin resistance gene cassette (neo, 1.1-kb fragment, from pMC1neoPoly(A), Stratagene) was then blunt end-ligated into the unique SacII site within the first exon of Gpx1. Finally, a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase cassette (Tk, 1.7 kb, from pMC1neoPoly(A)) was inserted into theSalI site, within the multicloning site, of pGEM 11Zf+ (see Fig. 1 A). Mouse D3 embryonic stem cells (approximately 107 cells) were electroporated with 20 μg of linear targeting sequence, as per Hwang et al. (30Hwang S.Y. Hertzog P.J. Holland K.A. Sumarsono S.H. Tymms M.J. Hamilton J.A. Whitty G. Bertoncello I. Kola I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11284-11288Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and selected with 175 μg·ml−1 G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 μm Cymevene™ (ganciclovir sodium) (Syntex, Australia). Resistant colonies were isolated and screened by Southern blotting. DNA was digested with BamHI and hybridized with a 770-bpGpx1 EcoRI fragment (probe 1; see Fig. 1 A). BamHI-restricted DNA was also hybridized with a 1.1-kb neomycin resistance gene (probe 2). Targeted clones were further confirmed by a second restriction with NcoI and hybridization with Gpx1 (probe 1) and neo (probe 3; a 850-bp neomycin resistance gene fragment excised from plasmid pMC1neoPoly(A) by NcoI and XhoI digestion) (see Fig. 1 A). Clones containing the Gpx1 targeted sequence were microinjected into Balb/c blastocysts and transferred into pseudopregnant females. Chimaeras were mated with CF1 females, and progeny was analyzed by Southern blotting and/or PCR. 5′ and 3′ primers were designed to detect targeted and non-targeted Gpx1alleles. The 5′ primer is 5′-AAG GAG GTG CAG GCG GCT GTG AGC G-3′, and the 3′ primer is 5′-GCG CGG AGA AGG CAT ACA CGG TGG-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: one 7-min denaturation step at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of (i) 1 min at 94 °C, (ii) 1 min at 60 °C, and (iii) 1 min at 72 °C. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total RNA was loaded on each track of a 17.5% formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel, electrophoresed, transferred to Genescreen Plus membranes (NEN Life Science Products), and probed with a 770-bp EcoRI genomic [32P]dCTP-labeled Gpx1 fragment (29de Haan J.B. Newman J.D. Kola I. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 13: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A 1.1-kb rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe was used as a control for RNA loading. Filters were prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 25% SSC, 1% Denhardt's solution, and 300 μg·ml−1 salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in 10% dextran sulfate, 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 1 m NaCl, and 0.4 μg·ml−1 salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed in 2×, 1×, and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, and signals for Gpx1 were detected on a Fujix BAS 1000 phosphor image analyzer. Two-month-old mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 1% avertin solution and cardiac perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brain, heart, liver, lung, and kidney were immediately removed and snap-frozen. Grinding was done in liquid nitrogen, and homogenates were obtained by adding 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mmEDTA and kept on ice. The samples were then centrifuged at 100 000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and stored at −70 °C until assays were performed. Gpx activity was assayed using a modified method of Lawrence and Burk (32Lawrence R.A. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). Briefly, reduced glutathione and hydrogen peroxide were used as substrates, and oxidized glutathione produced by Gpxs was monitored through NADPH oxidation with glutathione reductase. The final concentrations of the reagents in the reaction mixture were 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm NADPH, 1 unit·ml−1 GSSG reductase, 4 mm GSH, and 0.25 mm H2O2. The change in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded. Gpx activity was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 · 10−3μm−1·cm−1 for NADPH at 340 nm. Specific activities are expressed as nmol of NADPH·min−1·mg−1 protein. Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Bovine serum albumin (Promega) was used as a protein standard. Mice of approximately 6 weeks of age were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 1% avertin solution. The entire body was cardiac perfused with PBS and then with Bouin's fixative. The organs were then embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were examined under a light microscope. Mice of approximately 6 weeks of age were injected intraperitoneally with paraquat at doses of 10, 20, or 30 mg·kg−1 body weight (methyl viologen (1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride), catalog no. 1910-42-5; Sigma) prepared in PBS, and their health status was observed several times per day for 10 days. In some experiments, Gpx1wild-type and knockout mice of approximately 6 weeks of age were injected intraperitoneally with paraquat at a dose of 30 mg·kg−1 body weight (prepared in PBS) or PBS and killed 4 h later, and lung Gpx activity was assayed as described above. A 1013-bp fragment containing the 5′-flanking or upstream promoter region of human GPX1(GenBankTM accession no. AF029317) was isolated from a human genomic library and sequenced using Sanger's dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (33Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). A KpnI site was attached to the 5′ or upstream terminus. The 1-kb GPX1 fragment was directionally cloned (using the KpnI site and a naturally occurring MunI site of GPX1) into a pGEM3 vector (Promega; previously modified to contain a MunI site). The naturally occurring GPX1 MunI site occurs downstream of the mRNA initiation site but upstream of the start (ATG) codon. TheGPX1 fragment was then cloned into the pGL2-enhancer (Promega) in the correct orientation using the SacI andHindIII sites to produce the reporter construct pGL2(2A)5′GPX1-luciferase. HepG2 and CHO cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and supplemented with 50 ng·ml−1 of selenium to eliminate variation in endogenous cellular Gpx1 activity (34Hornsby P.J. Person D.W. Autor A.P. Aldern K.A. Harris S.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 123: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) due to post-transcriptional regulation of Gpx1 by selenium content (35Chu F.F. Esworthy E.S. Akman S. Doroshow J.H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5949-5958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 105 cells/35-mm well and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% humidified CO2. Transfection mixture was freshly prepared by mixing equal amounts of solution A (2 μg of pGL2-derived plasmid, 3 μg of SV40-galactosidase vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 μl of DMEM) and solution B (10 μl of Lipofectin in 100 μl of DMEM), allowing this to incubate for 15 min at room temperature, and then adding 800 μl of DMEM. The pGL2-derived plasmids were always co-transfected withSV40-galactosidase vector to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and once with DMEM, and finally lipofection solution (1 ml) was overlaid onto the cells. Cells were incubated for 5 h. The transfection solution was rinsed away by washing with PBS, and the cells were removed by trypsinization, centrifuged, and then replated to allow for uniform distribution of transfected cells. Two ml of normal growth medium containing increasing concentrations of paraquat (0–2 μg·ml−1 or 10 μg·ml−1 depending on cell line used) were then added, and cells were incubated for 18 h before luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed. After removal of the medium, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and 400 μl of Analytical Luminescence Laboratory lysis buffer (diluted 1:3) was added. This was followed by agitation for 15 min at 4 °C. Buffer containing lysed cells was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was removed for luciferase analysis. After removal of the medium, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and 400 μl of diluted reporter lysis buffer was added. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatant was collected. One hundred fifty μl of 2× galactosidase assay buffer was added to 150 μl of supernatant, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of sodium carbonate, and the absorbance was determined at 420 nm. Within each sample, endogenous galactosidase cellular activity was corrected for by assaying a plasmid-negative transfected cell extract. Primary cultures of murine cerebral cortical neurons were prepared using a modified method of Larm et al. (37Larm J.A. Cheung N.S. Beart P.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices were obtained from fetalGpx1 wild-type and knockout mice (15 or 16 days of gestation) under sterile conditions and maintained on ice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies). Cortices were digested in medium containing 0.2 mg·ml−1 trypsin and 20 μg·ml−1 DNase for 6 min at 37 °C and dissociated by trituration (15 strokes with a 24-gauge needle). Cells were resuspended in Neurobasal Medium™ (Life Technologies) containing B27 (38Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar), penicillin (100 units·ml−1), streptomycin (100 μg·ml−1), l-glutamine (0.5 mm), and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Sigma). Cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine (50 μg·ml−1)-coated plates at a density of 1.6 × 105 cells·cm−2 and maintained in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 8.5% O2; 37 °C). After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free growth medium. Test cultures were stained at day 8 for neuronal (MAP2) and glial (GFAP) markers using the method of Larm et al. (37Larm J.A. Cheung N.S. Beart P.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cultured neurons from wild-type and Gpx1 knockout mice were exposed to H2O2 on day 8 of culture. Dilutions of H2O2 were prepared in antioxidant free N-2 medium (Neurobasal medium, penicillin (100 units·ml−1), streptomycin (100 μg·ml−1), BSA (2.5 mg·ml−1), d-(+)-galactose (15 μg·ml−1), ethanolamine (1 μg·ml−1),l-carnitine (1 μg·ml−1), biotin (0.1 mg·ml−1), and N-2 supplement (39Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). Culture medium was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of H2O2solution that had been preincubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Each dilution of H2O2 was tested on 4–6 wells of cultured neurons and on two or more independent cultures. Cell viability was determined 24 h after H2O2 treatment by the addition of MTT (Sigma) (37Larm J.A. Cheung N.S. Beart P.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). MTT was dissolved in RPMI 1640 growth medium (Sigma) and 100 μl of 5 μg·ml−1 MTT was added to the cells in 1 ml of medium. Following a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, cells were lysed by the addition of 500 μl of 20% SDS in 40% dimethylformamide, pH 4.4. After overnight incubation at room temperature, absorbance at 570 nm was determined using a microplate reader. Cultured neurons were scraped from plates in PBS at day 8 of culture, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mm EDTA. The samples were then pelleted again by centrifugation, and the supernatants were collected and stored at −70 °C until Gpx assays were performed as described above. The neomycin resistance and the thymidine kinase genes allowed both positive and negative selection of embryonic stem cells in culture (see Fig. 1 A). One hundred forty-four resistant clones were isolated, and these were screened by Southern blotting. Two clones gave the expected BamHI restriction patterns (a 4.5-kb targeted allele and a 10.5-kb wild-type allele; Fig. 1 B) after hybridization with a 770-bpGpx1 genomic fragment (probe 1, see Fig. 1 A). Southern blots hybridized with a neomycin probe (probe 2; see Fig.1 A) also gave a 7.1-kb fragment of a correctly targeted event (data not shown). A second restriction digest was performed to further validate the targeted event. NcoI-restricted DNA was hybridized with both the Gpx1 probe (probe 1) and a neomycin probe that lacked sequences 3′ of the NcoI site (probe 3; see Fig. 1 A). Probe 1 detected two fragments of approximately 15.0 and 11.2 kb (Fig. 1 B) corresponding to the wild-type and targeted alleles, respectively, while probe 3 detected a fragment of approximately 5.0 kb (data not shown), further confirming a correctly targeted event. Heterozygous mice (+/−) were identified by screening agouti pups by Southern blot analysis (Fig.1 B) and/or by PCR using primers that spanned regions of theGpx1 gene adjacent to the neomycin resistance gene insertion site (5′p and 3′p; see Fig. 1 A). A targeted allele gave the expected PCR product of approximately 1.3 kb, while the non-targeted allele gave a fragment of approximately 0.1 kb (Fig. 1 C). Heterozygous mice were used in breeding experiments to generate mice that were homozygous (−/−) for the disruption of Gpx1 (Fig. 1, B and C). Northern blot analysis of mice homozygous for the targeted Gpx1 mutation (−/−) showed that Gpx1 mRNA expression was not detected in all of the five organs examined (liver, brain, heart, kidney, and lung) (Fig.2). In wild-type mice, Gpx1mRNA was abundantly expressed in the five organs with particularly high levels in the liver and kidney (Fig. 2). Gpx activity was measured in tissues of mice homozygous for the targeted mutation and age-matched wild-type controls. The relative amount of Gpx activity in liver, kidney, lung, and brain of knockout mice was not detectable and/or was negligible as compared with controls (<4% of controls; TableI). A 32% residual Gpx activity was found in the heart of knockout mice. Such residual activity is most likely due to other Gpx isoenzymes, since the Gpx assay used in this study is not specific for Gpx1 but measures other Se-dependent Gpxs as well.Table IGpx activity in tissues and cultured neurons of Gpx1 wild-type and knockout miceOrgansGpx activityPercentage of wild-typenmol/min/mg%Liver +/+2232 ± 239 −/−6 ± 1ap < 0.001 (Student's ttest).0.3Kidney +/+470 ± 99 −/−17 ± 3bp < 0.01.3.6Heart +/+87 ± 11 −/−28 ± 9cp < 0.05.32Lung +/+100 ± 6 −/−NDdND, not detectable; defines specific activities lower than 3.5 nmol of NADPH · min−1 · mg−1protein.Brain +/+24 ± 3 −/−NDNeurons +/+9 ± 1 −/−NDGpx activity was measured in liver, brain, heart, kidney, lung, and cultured neurons (day 8 of culture) of Gpx1 wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (−/−) mice.

To examine the importance of Gpx1 in protecting against oxidative stress, we challenged Gpx1 wild-type and knockout mice with paraquat, since it is a well known generator of free radicals within cells (40Bus J.S.

Our recent work has provided evidence that inducible NOS (iNOS) may also catalyze O⨪2 formation in macrophages. However, there has been a lack of direct evidence of superoxide generation from the purified iNOS, and it was previously hypothesized that significant O⨪2production does not occur. Moreover, the mechanism and enzyme site responsible for O⨪2 generation is unknown. To determine whether iNOS produces O⨪2 and to identify the mechanism of this process, we performed electron paramagnetic resonance measurements on purified iNOS using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide. In the presence of NADPH, prominent O⨪2adduct signals were detected from iNOS. These signals were totally abolished by superoxide dismutase but not affected by catalase. High concentrations of l-arginine decreased this O⨪2formation, whereas its enantiomer d-arginine did not. Pre-incubation of iNOS with the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium totally blocked these O⨪2 signals. Conversely, pretreatment of the enzyme with the heme blocker cyanide had no effect on O⨪2 generation. Furthermore, strong O⨪2 generation was directly detected from the isolated iNOS reductase domain.

Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). In cells or tissues, NO is produced by a family of NO synthases (NOSs), which utilizel-arginine, oxygen, and NADPH as substrates to synthesize NO as well as the coproduct l-citrulline (2Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Masters B.S.S. McMillan K. Sheta E.A. Nishimura J.S. Roman L.J. Martasek P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Three distinct isoforms of NOS have been cloned: neuronal NOS (nNOS, type I), inducible NOS (iNOS, type II), and endothelial NOS (eNOS, type III) (4Nathan C. Xie Q.-w. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar). nNOS and eNOS are also referred to as constitutive NOS, while the expression of iNOS requires induction by microbial endotoxins or cytokines. With tightly bound calmodulin, iNOS is fully active at basal Ca2+ levels, whereas constitutive nNOS and eNOS activity depend on the elevation of intracellular Ca2+. In addition to calmodulin-binding sites, all three NOS isoforms also contain FAD, FMN, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) binding sites and require these cofactors for their enzymatic function (5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). nitric oxide nitric-oxide synthase inducible NOS neuronal NOS endothelial NOS 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide riboflavin 5′-phosphate tetrahydrobiopterin peroxynitrite electron paramagnetic resonance N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester superoxide dismutase diphenyleneiodonium. Besides synthesizing NO, purified nNOS can catalyze superoxide (O⨪2) formation when l-arginine is absent (6Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Bohme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This is also a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent process. In l-arginine-depleted cells, nNOS was found to generate both O⨪2 and NO leading to peroxynitrite (ONOO−)-mediated cell injury (8Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Whereas the O⨪2generation from nNOS was well documented both in vitro and in intact cells, controversy remains regarding whether iNOS is also capable of producing O⨪2. Considering the similarity in amino acid sequence and enzymatic function between these two isoforms, it would be expected that iNOS will also generate O⨪2. However, iNOS was reported to be much less prone to oxidize NADPH than nNOS under conditions of l-arginine depletion, and it was presumed that iNOS does not produce significant amounts of O⨪2(9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This highly limited O⨪2-generating capacity from iNOS has been proposed to be critical for its biological functions since O⨪2 could in turn react with and scavenge NO, and it was hypothesized that this would perturb iNOS-mediated immune defense actions (9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 10Bastian N.R. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, our experiments on macrophages have provided evidence that iNOS may produce significant amounts of O⨪2 in cells (11Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6954-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Under l-arginine depletion, iNOS was found to generate O⨪2 as well as ONOO−, and these oxidants may contribute to the antibacterial activity of macrophages. However, these observations on macrophages cannot conclusively prove if iNOS synthesizes O⨪2. So far, definitive oxygen radical measurements on purified iNOS have not been performed. Moreover, even if iNOS is indeed capable of synthesizing O⨪2, questions remain regarding whether the mechanism of O⨪2 generation from iNOS is similar to or different from that of nNOS. To address these issues, we have applied electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping techniques to directly measure and characterize the process of O⨪2 generation from purified iNOS. We also explored the role of the reductase and oxygenase domains in this iNOS-catalyzed O⨪2 generation. Materials—The NADPH, l- ord-arginine, BH4, calmodulin,l-NAME, dithiothreitol, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and sodium cyanide (NaCN) were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA) and Fisher, respectively. Cell culture materials were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and S-200 gel were the products of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. l-[14C]Arginine was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. DMPO was purchased from Aldrich and further purified by double distillation. DEPMPO was prepared as reported (12Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tucci B. Le Moigne F. Culcasi M. Pietri S. Lauricella R. Tordo P. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of iNOS was based on that of nNOS, as described previously (13Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A similar expression system for iNOS has been reported (14Fosseta J.D. Niu X.D. Lunn C.A. Zavodny P.J. Narula S.K. Lundell D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, two plasmids containing mouse iNOS gene (iNOSpCW) and rat calmodulin sequence (pACMIP) were cotransfected into Escherichia coliBL21 cells via electroporation. Under selective pressure (50 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol), bacteria were grown toA600 = 0.8-1.2 at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The heme and flavin precursors, δ-aminolevulinic acid and riboflavin, were also added to final concentrations of 450 and 3 μm, respectively. The flasks were moved to room temperature (22–25 °C) and shaken in the dark at 250 rpm. The cells were harvested at about 40 h postinduction, and the cell paste was frozen at −80 °C until purification. Harvested cells were resuspended in 30 ml of resuspension buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) per liter of initial culture and were lysed by sonication. After centrifugation (150,000 × gfor 60 min), the supernatant was applied to 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The column was washed with at least 10 column volumes of buffer B. The protein was eluted with buffer B containing 500 mm NaCl and 5 mm 2′-AMP, and is approximately 50% pure after this step. The iNOS-containing fractions were concentrated using a Centriprep 30 (Amicon). After reconstitution with BH4 (250 μm), this fraction was applied to a S-200 gel filtration column. The iNOS-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C. iNOS concentration was determined by CO-difference spectrum, assuming an extinction coefficient of 75 mm−1 cm−1. The purity of iNOS was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized with Coomassie Blue staining. iNOS activity was up to 1300 nmol/min/mg at 37 °C assayed by monitoring the conversion ofl-[14C]arginine tol-[14C]citrulline as described below. The iNOS reductase domain construct is residues 499–1144 of the holoenzyme, encompassing the calmodulin binding site. An alanine and six histidine residues were added directly following the initiation methionine (MAHHHHHH … ). At the beginning of the cDNA is anNdeI (CATATG) site, and at the end is a HindIII site (AAGCTT). The construct was made by inserting polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA, incorporating the above changes, from the iNOSpCW plasmid into NdeI/HindIII restricted pCW vector. The resultant iNOS reductase domain plasmid was coexpressed with the calmodulin plasmid (pACMIP), as in the holoenzyme. The growth was the same as the above except that delta-ALA was not added at induction. The cells were harvested, and the supernatant of cell lysate was loaded on 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column. Fractions containing iNOS reductase domain were pooled and loaded onto a nickel-charged metal chelating column in buffer B plus 5 mm imidazole. The column was washed with about 10 volumes of this buffer, and the iNOS reductase domain was eluted with buffer B containing 100 mmimidazole. iNOS-catalyzed l-[14C]arginine tol-[14C]citrulline conversion was monitored in a total volume of 300 μl buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 μml-[14C]arginine, 0.5 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm Ca2+, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 μm BH4, and 3 μg/ml purified NOS. After a 5-min incubation at ambient temperature (23 °C) or 37 °C, the reaction was terminated. l-[14C]Citrulline was separated by passing reaction mixtures through Dowex AG 50W-X8 (Na+ form, Bio-Rad) cation exchange columns and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting (15Bredt D.S.

Spin trapping measurements of oxygen free radicals were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mmNADPH, 0.5 mm Ca2+, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 7.3 μg/ml purified iNOS, and the spin trap DMPO (50 mm) or DEPMPO (25 mm). EPR spectra were recorded in a quartz flat cell at room temperature (23 °C) with a Bruker ER 300 spectrometer operating at X-band with a TM 110 cavity using a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 0.5 G, microwave power of 20 mW, and microwave frequency of 9.785 GHz as described (11Xia Y.

The microwave frequency and magnetic field were precisely measured using an EIP 575 microwave frequency counter and Bruker ER 035 NMR gauss meter. Quantitation of the free radical signals was performed by comparing the double integral of the observed signal with that of a known concentration of TEMPO free radical in aqueous solution as described previously (17Xia Y. Khatchikian G. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10096-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse iNOS was isolated from an E. coliexpression system. This system has been proven to be a powerful and efficient way to prepare large quantities of NOS proteins (13Roman L.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17791-17796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recombinant eNOS or nNOS from this system has exhibited enzymatic properties indistinguishable from native enzymes isolated from mammalian cells (13Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 19Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). iNOS was isolated by NADPH affinity chromatography, and the purity of the preparations was further improved by size exclusion chromatography. As shown in Fig.1, top, purified protein preparations exhibited a prominent major band (>90% pure) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular mass of 130 kDa, which is in agreement with the molecular mass for native iNOS as previously reported (4Nathan C. Xie Q.-w. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar, 5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This recombinant protein possessed strong NOS activity as measured from conversion of l-arginine tol-citrulline (Fig. 1, bottom). The catalytic activity was independent of additional Ca2+ and could be blocked by the NOS inhibitor, l-NAME (1 mm), confirming that it was derived from iNOS. To determine whether iNOS generates O⨪2, EPR spin-trapping measurements were performed on iNOS using the well characterized spin trap DMPO. In the absence of the enzyme, no signals were observed from solutions containing DMPO and NADPH (Fig.2, top, trace A). However, after adding purified iNOS (7.3 μg/ml), strong EPR signals were seen (Fig. 2, bottom, trace B). These prominent signals exhibited the characteristic DMPO-OOH spectrum (aN = 14.2 G, aH = 11.3 G, aHγ = 1.3 G), indicative of trapped O⨪2. A small DMPO-OH signal (aH= aN = 14.9 G), which can be derived from the breakdown of DMPO-OOH, was also observed. These signals were totally abolished by SOD (200 units/ml) but not affected by catalase (300 units/ml) (Fig. 2, top, traces C andD), demonstrating that O⨪2 was the primary oxygen radical generated by iNOS and that the small DMPO-OH signals were derived from the decomposition of DMPO-OOH (20Finkelstein E. Rosen G.M. Rauckman E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 262-265PubMed Google Scholar). EPR signals from iNOS persisted for at least 60 min, indicating that sustained O⨪2generation occurred. The time course of O⨪2 generation from iNOS is shown in Fig. 2, bottom. As shown, the signals were detected immediately after the start of the reaction and reached peak levels after 4∼5 min. In the presence of SOD, the process of O⨪2 generation was totally quenched. To reconfirm and quantify the production of O⨪2 from iNOS, the recently developed spin trap DEPMPO was also used. The O⨪2adduct, DEPMPO-OOH (half-life ∼15 min), is much more stable than that of DMPO, which allows more accurate quantitative measurement of O⨪2 production (21Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As shown in the Fig.3 A, no EPR signals were observed in the reaction system with 25 mm DEPMPO in the absence of iNOS. After adding iNOS, prominent DEPMPO-OOH signals were seen (Fig. 3 B). These signals were totally quenched by SOD (200 units/ml, Fig. 3 C), reconfirming the process of O⨪2 generation from iNOS. By comparing the double integral of observed signals with that of known concentrations of the standard TEMPO measured under the same conditions, the initial rate of DEPMPO-OOH production was determined to be 0.4 μm/min. Using the previously reported value for the efficiency of O⨪2trapping by DEPMPO of approximately 60%, we estimate the initial rate of O⨪2 generation to be 0.67 μm/min which for the 7.5 μg/ml of iNOS protein used corresponds to 89 nmol/min/mg. Under similar room temperature conditions, the NOS activity measured froml-[14C]arginine tol-[14C]citrulline conversion was 290 ± 6 nmol/min/mg. Because nNOS generates O⨪2 only in the absence ofl-arginine, we studied the effect of l-arginine on the O⨪2 formation from iNOS. Interestingly, iNOS-catalyzed O⨪2 formation was not effected by low levels ofl-arginine. With 100 μml-arginine present, O⨪2 signals were essentially unchanged (spectrum similar to Fig.4 A, not shown). However,l-arginine at high concentrations (1-5 mm) markedly decreased the O⨪2 signals (Fig. 4, B andC). This inhibition was specifically elicited byl-arginine because its enantiomer, d-arginine, at the same concentration (5 mm) had no effects (Fig.4 D). The fact that iNOS-catalyzed O⨪2 is much less sensitive to l-arginine raised the question of whether O⨪2 is synthesized at the heme center of the oxygenase domain or the flavins bound at the reductase domain. To explore whether O⨪2 was generated from the oxygenase or the reductase domain of iNOS, the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI and heme blocker NaCN were used. O⨪2 generation from iNOS was completely blocked by DPI (20 μm, Fig. 4 F) but not effected by NaCN (100 μm, Fig. 4 E). The effects of DPI and NaCN strongly suggest that O⨪2 generation primarily occurs at the flavin-binding sites of the reductase domain, not the heme center of the oxygenase domain. To directly prove that the iNOS reductase domain is responsible for this O⨪2 formation, measurements were also carried out using isolated iNOS reductase domain (residues 499–1144). In the control experiments without the iNOS reductase domain, no EPR signal was detected (Fig. 5 A). After adding the iNOS reductase domain (7 μg/ml), strong O⨪2generation was observed as expected (Fig. 5 B). These O⨪2 signals were totally abolished by SOD (200 units/ml, Fig.5 C). In parallel to the results obtained from holoenzyme, O⨪2 production from the iNOS reductase domain was also prevented by DPI (20 μm, Fig. 5 D). Thus, these experiments provide incontrovertible proof that O⨪2 generation occurs from the reductase domain. Two important findings emerge from this study. First, the spin trapping experiments present definitive evidence demonstrating that iNOS does synthesize O⨪2 in addition to NO. With the oxygen radical spin trap DMPO, strong O⨪2-derived EPR signals are detected from iNOS in the presence of NADPH. The effects of SOD and catalase on these EPR signals reconfirm that O⨪2 is the primary oxygen radical generated by iNOS. iNOS-catalyzed O⨪2 can be significantly decreased by l-arginine, which is also in accordance with our previous observations in macrophages where iNOS-derived oxygen radical generation was stimulated byl-arginine depletion (11Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6954-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Second, our results indicate that O⨪2 synthesis from iNOS mainly occurs at the flavin-binding sites of its reductase domain. This is different from the process of O⨪2 generation from nNOS which is thought to occur primarily at the oxygenase domain (5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). This may have important implications in the enzymatic and biological function of iNOS. Although derived from separate genes and chromosomes, the three NOS isoforms share 50–60% identity in their amino acid sequence (4Nathan C. Xie Q.-w. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar, 5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are all bi-domain enzymes consisting of a C-terminal reductase and N-terminal oxygenase. The reductase domain contains NADPH, FAD, and FMN binding sites and exhibits 58% homology to NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (22Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). Binding sites for heme, BH4, andl-arginine are located at the oxygenase domain. A unified model has been proposed to explain the enzymatic mechanism of NOSs (5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their catalytic mechanisms involve flavin-mediated electron transport from C-terminal-bound NADPH and flavins to an N-terminal heme center, where oxygen is reduced and incorporated into the guanidino group ofl-arginine giving rise to NO and l-citrulline. Calmodulin binds to a consensus sequence in the NOS enzymes and serves to position the two domains allowing the electron transfer from FMN to heme (5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cho H.J. Xie Q.-w. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Although iNOS and nNOS may share similar NO-synthesizing mechanisms, our study reveals a dramatic difference in their mechanisms of O⨪2 generation. nNOS produces O⨪2 when the heme center is not occupied by l-arginine (5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol.

This process requires Ca2+/calmodulin to facilitate the delivery of electrons from the reductase to oxygenase domains. In contrast, O⨪2 generation from iNOS was much less sensitive tol-arginine and cannot be blocked by cyanide, indicating that it does not occur primarily at the heme. On the other hand, the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI can totally prevent iNOS-catalyzed O⨪2 formation. Finally, the experiments performed on isolated iNOS reductase domain definitively demonstrate that O⨪2synthesis occurs at the flavin-binding sites of the reductase domain (Fig. 6). iNOS and nNOS exhibit very differentl-arginine-dependent inhibition of O⨪2generation. Inhibition of O⨪2 generation from iNOS was seen only at high l-arginine concentrations. Whereas 100 μml-arginine can totally block O⨪2generation from nNOS (7Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Bohme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), iNOS-mediated O⨪2 formation was essentially unaltered by 100 μml-arginine. Even in the presence of high levels of l-arginine (1 mm), iNOS-catalyzed O⨪2 was only partially blocked. In fact, the mechanisms underlying l-arginine-induced inhibition may also vary with these two isoforms.l-arginine blocks the O⨪2 generation from nNOS by occupying the heme center leading to NO and l-citrulline formation. From our experiments, it is not clear why large amounts ofl-arginine are required to quench the O⨪2 generated from the reductase domain, especially in light of the lowKm values for l-arginine with iNOS (1–10 μm). The fact that the signal was not affected by 100 μml-arginine indicates that DMPO in the 50 mm concentrations used effectively outcompeted NO for reaction with O⨪2. The loss of signal at highl-arginine concentrations is most likely due to substrate inhibition. A nonspecific effect of the amino acid is less likely because identical concentrations of d-arginine had no effect. Similarly a reaction between arginine and DMPO-OOH is unlikely because d-arginine had no effect. We hypothesize that higher concentrations of l-arginine suppress the O⨪2 generation from iNOS either by altering the conformation of the protein and accessibility of the flavin or by rendering the flavin in a more oxidized state due to more rapid electron transfer to the heme. Our data did show that substantial O⨪2 generation occurs even in the presence of 1 mml-arginine, strongly suggesting that O⨪2 and NO synthesis can occur simultaneously within iNOS. It has been well established that O⨪2 reacts with NO at diffusion-limited rates to form another potent oxidant ONOO− (25Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar). Therefore, O⨪2 and NO generated from iNOS may combine to form ONOO−. Indeed, iNOS has been found to generate ONOO− in l-arginine-depleted macrophages (11Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6954-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Considering the structural similarity between the NOS reductase domain and cytochrome P-450 reductase, and because cytochrome P-450 reductase is known to be capable of reducing oxygen to O⨪2 (26Prough R.A. Masters B.S.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 212: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Nishibayashi H. Omura T. Sato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 520-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Masters B.S.S. Bilimoria M.H. Kamin H. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4081-4088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not surprising that the iNOS reductase domain can generate O⨪2. A recent study showed that the reductase domain of eNOS can also utilize adriamycin as an electron acceptor to generate O⨪2 (29Vasquez-Vivar J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11293-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, nNOS-derived O⨪2 is highly sensitive to l-arginine and is thought to mainly arise from the oxygenase domain (5Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). This different O⨪2 generation mechanism between nNOS and iNOS appears to precisely match the requirements of their biological function. nNOS mainly generates NO that serves as a neurotransmitter. Because of the relative highl-arginine levels in cytosol (200–800 μm), under physiological conditions, O⨪2 generation would rarely occur. This will ensure that nNOS only produces NO and operates properly in signal transduction in neurons. On the other hand, host defense is the main role of iNOS. Simultaneous NO and O⨪2generation may be more beneficial than NO formation alone, because these two free radicals will interact to form the more potent toxic oxidant, ONOO−. Moreover, the combination of O⨪2and NO will prevent the feedback inhibition on iNOS caused by NO or O⨪2, promoting sustained NO and O⨪2 generation which eventually enhances the killing activity of iNOS.

Caveolae are small, plasma membrane invaginations first identified by Palade and co-workers in the 1950s (1Palade G.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1953; 24: 1424Google Scholar). Although caveolae are non-clathrin-coated invaginations, subsequent studies have shown that caveolae do possess a striated coat that appears to be comprised largely of caveolin (2Rothberg K.G.

Caveolin is a 21-kDa integral membrane protein first described as a substrate for the tyrosine kinase, pp60src (3Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J.

It is a member of a family of three homologous proteins termed caveolin, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3 (5Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P.

Caveolae appear to represent specialized lipid domains that contain high levels of glycosphingolipids and cholesterol (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This unusual lipid composition renders caveolae and their constituent proteins resistant to solubilization with Triton X-100. Thus, caveolae can be isolated as a low density membrane fraction from cells lysed in the presence of Triton X-100 (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). Because proteins might be redistributed during extraction of membranes with Triton X-100, detergent-free procedures have also been developed to isolate caveolae (9Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T.

Substantial evidence also implicates caveolae/DIGs in signal transduction. Low density membrane fractions prepared in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 contain many proteins involved in signal transduction, including low molecular weight and heterotrimeric G proteins, src family kinases, EGF receptors, PDGF receptors, endothelin receptors, the phosphotyrosine phosphatase syp, Grb2, Shc, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, protein kinase C, and the p85 subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase (9Song K.S.

Together these results have been used to support the hypothesis that caveolae/DIGs provide a site within the plasma membrane at which signaling molecules are concentrated and through which initial signaling events proceed. Not only signaling proteins but also signaling lipids appear to be concentrated in low density membrane domains. Studies with Madin-Darby canine kidney, A431, and Neuro 2a cells indicate that as much as half of the cellular PtdIns 4,5-P2 in cells is present in low density, detergent-insoluble domains that are enriched in caveolin (22Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 23Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol.

Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). If localization of PtdIns 4,5-P2 and other signaling proteins in low density membrane domains is required for hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover, then disruption of these domains should result in the ablation of this biological response. We report here that treatment of A431 cells with the cholesterol-binding agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin leads to depletion of cellular cholesterol and results in the loss of compartmentalization of PtdIns 4,5-P2, EGF receptors, and Gq. This delocalization of signaling components is associated with a loss of EGF- and bradykinin-stimulated PtdIns turnover. Replacement of cellular cholesterol leads to the reorganization of the low density domains and the reestablishment of hormone-stimulated PtdIns hydrolysis. These data implicate cholesterol in the process of hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover and are consistent with the hypothesis that the localization of signaling proteins and lipids to cholesterol-enriched domains is required for the function of this signaling pathway. Anti-caveolin-1 and anti-caveolin-2 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Gq antibody was from Santa Cruz. The polyclonal antibody to the EGF receptor (DB-1) was prepared as described previously (25Schuh S.M. Newberry E.P. Dalton M.A. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol.

Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was from Aldrich. All other chemicals were from Sigma. A431 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 7% newborn calf serum and 3% fetal calf serum. For labeling, subconfluent cultures were switched to inositol-free DMEM containing 5% newborn calf serum and 1 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol and grown for a further 48 h, at which point the cultures were confluent. One 150-mm plate of A431 cells was washed in phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold 150 mm Na2CO3, pH 11, 2 mm EDTA. The cells were passed through a 23-gauge needle 10 times and subsequently sonicated 3 times for 15 s on ice using a Branson 250 sonicator set at maximum power output for a microtip. The lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA) and placed in the bottom of a centrifuge tube. 6 ml of 35% sucrose in MES-buffered saline and 4 ml of 5% sucrose in MES-buffered saline were layered on top of the lysate. The gradient was centrifuged for 3 h at 175,000 × gand fractionated into 10 1.2-ml fractions. The small pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of MES-buffered saline. Aliquots (800 μl) of each sucrose density gradient fraction were extracted in chloroform: methanol:HCl and inositol phospholipids analyzed as described previously (22Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For analysis of cholesterol levels, lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh-Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42411) Google Scholar), and cholesterol was assayed using the Cholesterol CII assay kit (Wako). Cells were plated in six-well dishes and labeled with myo-[3H]inositol as described above. Before the assay, cells were switched to inositol-free DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Vehicle, EGF (50 nm), or bradykinin (10 μm) was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Assays were terminated by aspiration of the medium, washing once in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and addition of 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid. Inositol phosphates were isolated on Dowex columns as described previously (28Downes C.P. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Aliquots (100 μl) of sucrose density gradient fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked using 10% powdered milk and then incubated for 2 h with primary antibody. Antibody detection was carried out using Enhanced Chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's specifications. Sterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes were synthesized as described by Klein et al. (29Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 mg of sterol was dissolved in 80 μl of isopropyl alcohol:CHCl3 (2:1). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (200 mg) was dissolved in 2.2 ml of water and heated to 80 °C with stirring in a water bath. The sterol was added in small aliquots and the solution stirred until clear. This yields a solution that contains 6.8 mm sterol. For use, complexes were diluted into inositol-free DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. We have demonstrated previously that PtdInsP2 is compartmentalized in caveolae/DIGs and that it is this compartmentalized PtdInsP2 that is turned over in response to hormones (22Hope H.R. Pike L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 23Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Because caveolae/DIGs are membrane domains that are enriched in cholesterol, we wondered what effect cholesterol depletion would have on the integrity of these domains, their ability to compartmentalize PtdInsP2, and the process of hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin is a cholesterol-binding agent that removes cholesterol from intact cells (30Ohtani Y. Irie T. Uekama K. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 31Kilsdonk E.P.C. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). A431 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min at 37 °C and then assayed for EGF- and bradykinin-stimulated PtdIns turnover. As shown in Fig. 1, cyclodextrin dose dependently inhibited inositol phosphate production stimulated by both hormones. The dose response to cyclodextrin for inhibition of PtdIns turnover was similar for both hormones, suggesting that the effect of cyclodextrin was not receptor-specific but rather more generally targeted. The effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin on hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover was rapid and was associated with a decrease in total cellular cholesterol levels. The data in Fig. 2demonstrate that both EGF- and bradykinin-stimulated PtdIns turnover were inhibited significantly within 10 min after the addition of cyclodextrin. Maximal inhibition was observed after 30–40 min of treatment with this agent. Over this same time period, cellular cholesterol levels declined almost linearly. Maximal inhibition of hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover occurred when approximately half of the cellular cholesterol had been removed. However, 50% inhibition was observed when only 20% of the cellular cholesterol had been lost. To determine the effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin on the integrity of caveolae/DIGs, A431 cells were treated in the absence or presence of this reagent for 30 min. Low density membrane fractions were then isolated, and the distribution of several proteins enriched in caveolae/DIGs was assessed by Western blotting of the analytical sucrose density gradients (Fig. 3). Fraction 1 represents the top of the gradient, and fraction 10 is the bottom of the gradient. Fraction 4 contains the 5%/35% sucrose interface. In untreated cells, the majority of the caveolin-1 was found in fraction 4, identifying this fraction as the caveolar fraction. After treatment with cyclodextrin, this tight compartmentalization was lost, and the bulk of the caveolin-1 was recovered in the high density region of the gradient, fractions 9, 10, and the pellet. Similarly, caveolin-2 was strongly localized to fraction 4 in control cells but was found almost exclusively in the high density fractions in cyclodextrin-treated cells. Treatment of A431 cells with cyclodextrin also led to the loss of compartmentalization of signaling-related proteins in the low density fractions. Both the EGF receptor and Gq were extensively localized to fraction 4 in untreated cells. However, after treatment with cyclodextrin both of these proteins were lost from the low density portion of the gradient and recovered instead in the high density region of the gradient. To determine the effect of cholesterol depletion on the compartmentalization of PtdInsP2, A431 cells were labeled with [3H]inositol and subsequently treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min (Fig.4). Treatment with cyclodextrin did not significantly alter the distribution of PtdIns or lyso-PtdIns in A431 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). However, this treatment was associated with the loss of PtdInsP and PtdInsP2 from the low density, caveolin-enriched fraction of the sucrose gradients (Fig. 4, C and D). The PtdInsP and PtdInsP2 lost from fraction 4 were recovered quantitatively in the high density fractions, indicating that there was not a general decrease of polyphosphoinositides but rather a specific relocalization of these lipids to other parts of the cell membrane. These data suggest that depletion of cellular cholesterol results in the loss of hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover and the delocalization of caveolin, signaling proteins and PtdInsP2 from the low density membrane fraction. Whereas methyl-β-cyclodextrin can remove cholesterol from cell membranes, soluble complexes of cholesterol and methyl-β-cyclodextrin can mediate the incorporation of cholesterol into membranes (29Klein U.

To determine whether the loss of hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover and the loss of integrity of caveolin-enriched membrane domains were due to the depletion of cholesterol, A431 cells were first treated with cyclodextrin for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed and incubated for increasing times with either 0.1% bovine serum albumin or cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes in 0.1% bovine serum albumin and tested for bradykinin-stimulated PtdIns turnover. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment of cholesterol-depleted cells with cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes rapidly reversed the cyclodextrin-induced loss of bradykinin-stimulated PtdIns turnover. Essentially complete recovery was observed within 20 min after the addition of cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes. Some reversal occurred in the presence of bovine serum albumin alone, but it was slower and less extensive than that seen in the presence of the cholesterol-containing complexes. This may be due to redistribution of cholesterol from intracellular membranes to the plasma membrane. Treatment with the cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes also reversed the effects of cyclodextrin treatment on EGF-stimulated PtdIns turnover (not shown). Measurement of the cholesterol levels of cells treated with cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes confirmed that treatment with the complexes led to the repletion of cellular cholesterol, whereas incubation in bovine serum albumin-containing medium did not lead to an increase in cholesterol levels (TableI).Table ICholesterol levels in cells treated with cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexesConditionCholesterolμg/wellControl11.1 ± 0.5+Cyclodextrin7.5 ± 0.3* +Bovine serum albumin10 min7.4 ± 0.1*20 min6.7 ± 0.3*30 min7.0 ± 0.4* +Cholesterol complexes10 min9.4 ± 0.3*20 min9.8 ± 1.030 min10.3 ± 0.6A431 cells were treated without (Control) or with 5 mmmethyl-β-cyclodextrin (+Cyclodextrin) for 30 min at 37 °C.

Methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes of several oxysterol analogs of cholesterol were also prepared to determine whether these cholesterol derivatives could reverse the effects of cyclodextrin on PtdIns turnover. As shown in Fig. 6, there was significant variation in the ability of the different analogs to restore hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover. For both EGF- and bradykinin-stimulated inositol phosphate production, 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol were unable to reverse the effects of cyclodextrin. However, other oxysterol derivatives were able to substitute for cholesterol. The 7-ketocholesterol derivative partially restored hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover, while cholesterol 5α,6α-epoxide was more effective than cholesterol in reversing the effects of cyclodextrin. Interestingly, while bradykinin-stimulated PtdIns turnover typically recovered to levels similar to or only slightly higher than control values, EGF-stimulated PtdIns turnover was consistently higher in sterol-replenished cells than in control cells. Thus, although the order of potency of the different oxysterols for restoring PtdIns turnover was similar for both hormones, the effect of sterol replacement was quantitatively different for the two hormones. Treatment of A431 cells with cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes also reversed the cyclodextrin-induced loss of integrity of the caveolin-enriched membrane fraction. The data in Fig.7 demonstrate that although caveolin-1 was lost from the low density fraction after a 30-min treatment with cyclodextrin, addition of cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes led to the recovery of the bulk of the caveolin in the low density fraction of the gradient. Similarly, EGF receptors and Gqwere lost from the low density domains upon treatment with cyclodextrin but were found to relocalize to the caveolin-containing fraction after incubation with cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes. The cyclodextrin-induced PtdInsP2 delocalization was also reversed after treatment with cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes (Fig. 8). Approximately two thirds of the PtdInsP2 originally present in the low density domain was lost after treatment of cells with cyclodextrin. However, after removal of the cyclodextrin and incubation with cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes, PtdInsP2 was recompartmentalized to the low density domains, and the level of this lipid in the caveolin-enriched fraction was similar to that seen in untreated cells. Neither cyclodextrin treatment nor treatment with cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin complexes significantly affected the fraction of PtdIns that was recovered in the low density domains (not shown). The data presented here demonstrate that hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover requires appropriate levels of cholesterol in cells. Removal of as little as 20% of the cellular cholesterol led to an ∼50% loss in EGF- or bradykinin-stimulated PtdIns turnover. Additional extraction of cholesterol from the cells resulted in a further loss of hormone-stimulated inositol phosphate production. These data suggest that this biological response is dependent on the presence of cholesterol in cell membranes. The cholesterol dependence of hormone-stimulated PtdIns hydrolysis may be caused by the localization of this signaling pathway to cholesterol-enriched membrane domains. We have shown previously that the hormone-sensitive pool of PtdInsP2 is localized in a caveolin-enriched membrane fraction that also contains EGF receptors and Gq (23Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).2 These domains typically contain high levels of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). We show here that the inhibition of PtdIns turnover that results from depletion of cell cholesterol is associated with a decrease in the compartmentalization of PtdInsP2 as well as caveolin, EGF receptors, and Gq. Treatment with cyclodextrin resulted in the loss of all of these components from the low density fraction and their recovery in the high density portion of the sucrose gradients. These data suggest that the removal of cholesterol disrupts the integrity of the low density domains. This results in the delocalization of these molecules and the inhibition of hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover. Bradykinin- and EGF-stimulated PtdIns turnover was inhibited over the same dose range of cyclodextrin and showed a similar time course of inhibition at a fixed concentration of cyclodextrin. While these data suggest that cyclodextrin treatment affects a component that is common to both pathways, it is not clear from these data whether the decrease in hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover is due to the loss of compartmentalization of PtdInsP2, the delocalization of EGF receptors and Gq, or a combination of these events. The association between domain integrity and hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover is strengthened further by the results of the experiments in which cholesterol was replaced in cyclodextrin-treated cells. Replenishing cellular cholesterol resulted in the re-formation of the caveolin-enriched membrane domains and the relocalization of PtdInsP2, EGF receptors, and Gq to the low density membrane fraction. Hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover was restored concomitant with the re-formation of the low density domains. These data are consistent with the conclusion that the localization of PtdInsP2 and signaling proteins to cholesterol-enriched domains is required for hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover. Disruption of the domains results in loss of hormonal responsiveness, while restoration of the domains is associated with the reinstatement of hormone effects. Because the effects of cyclodextrin can be reversed by the replacement of cholesterol, these results also suggest that the effect of cyclodextrin is due to its capacity to remove cholesterol from cells rather than by some other activity of this compound. Cholesterol replacement in cyclodextrin-treated cells consistently resulted in a marked increased in the ability of EGF to stimulate PtdIns hydrolysis compared with control, untreated cells. Although bradykinin-stimulated PtdIns turnover was also increased after cholesterol replacement, the enhancement was significantly less than that seen for EGF-induced PtdIns turnover. The generally greater ability of cholesterol and oxysterols to restore EGF-stimulated compared with bradykinin-stimulated PtdIns turnover suggests that sterols may have effects on the EGF pathway other than simple restoration of low density domain integrity. Cholesterol has been shown to modulate binding to the cholecystokinin and oxytocin receptors by both changes in membrane fluidity and specific molecular interactions (34Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed effects of sterols on hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover may be due not only by their capacity to re-form caveolae/DIGs but also to their ability to induce changes in membrane fluidity or interact directly with receptors or other signaling components. The observation that some but not all oxysterols are capable of reversing the effects of cyclodextrin is consistent with this possibility. If the hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics of the oxysterols were the only consideration in their ability to restore PtdIns turnover, then many of the compounds tested should have exhibited similar restorative properties. The vastly different capacities of the 7-keto, 5,6-epoxide, and 3,5,6-triol derivatives of cholesterol to reverse the effect of cyclodextrin on PtdIns turnover suggest that these compounds may regulate PtdIns hydrolysis by a mechanism other than simple structural replacement of cholesterol in cholesterol-enriched domains. Previous workers have reported inhibitory effects of cholesterol-reducing agents on signaling pathways. Liu et al. (35Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) reported that filipin reduced the PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. Similarly, McGuire et al. (36McGuire T.F. Corey S.J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22227-22230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that lovastatin inhibited the ability of PDGF to stimulate PtdIns 3-kinase activity and the association of p85 with the PDGF receptor. Cyclodextrin treatment was shown to reduce the affinity of oxytocin for its receptor, and this was associated with a decrease in the ability of this hormone to stimulate inositol phosphate production (29Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 34Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that many aspects of hormone signaling are dependent on cholesterol and may be mediated through low density, cholesterol-enriched domains. In summary, the data reported here demonstrate that hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover is dependent upon the presence of sufficient cholesterol in the cell membrane. The decrease in cellular cholesterol is associated with the loss of compartmentalization of PtdInsP2, Gq, and the EGF receptor in low density, caveolin-enriched membrane fraction. Replacement of cholesterol leads to the re-formation of these domains, the relocalization of these signaling components, and the reestablishment of hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover. These findings suggest that hormone-stimulated PtdIns turnover requires the integrity of cholesterol-enriched domains and imply that localization of both protein and lipid components to these low density domains is necessary for the proper function of this signaling system."

Immunofluorescent staining showed that the collapse of the cortical spectrin cytoskeleton is an early event following staurosporine challenge. This collapse correlated with the generation of a series of prominent spectrin breakdown products (BDPs) derived from both αII- and βII-subunits. Major C-terminal αII-spectrin BDPs were detected at ≈150, 145, and 120 kDa (αII-BDP150, αII-BDP145, and αII-BDP120, respectively); major C-terminal βII-spectrin BDPs were at ≈110 and 85 kDa (βII-BDP110 and βII-BDP85, respectively). N-terminal sequencing of the major fragments produced in vitro by caspase 3 revealed that αII-BDP150 and αII-BDP120 were generated by cleavages at DETD1185*S1186 and DSLD1478*S1479, respectively. For βII-spectrin, a major caspase site was detected at DEVD1457*S1458, and both βII-BDP110 and βII-BDP85 shared a common N-terminal sequence starting with Ser1458. An additional cleavage site near the C terminus, at ETVD2146*S2147, was found to account for βII-BDP85. Studies using specific caspase or calpain inhibitors indicate that the pattern of spectrin breakdown during apoptosis differs from that during non-apoptotic cell death. We postulate that in concert with calpain, caspase rapidly targets critical sites in both αII- and βII-spectrin and thereby initiates a rapid dissolution of the spectrin-actin cortical cytoskeleton with apoptosis.

Indeed, αII-spectrin cleavage by calpain appears to be a molecular mechanism by which skeletal plasticity can be enhanced without complete dissolution of the spectrin skeleton since calpain-mediated cleavage of αII-spectrin bestows calmodulin regulation on oligomeric spectrin-actin complexes, but does not dissociate them (unless βII-spectrin is also cleaved) (19Harris A.S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 15754-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), calpain also targets several additional sites in both αII- and βII-spectrin (27Harris A.S. Croall D. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15754-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 In the present report, we demonstrate the specific sites of caspase 3 cleavage within both αII- and βII-spectrin and show that during apoptotic induction in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, it is caspase 3 that most rapidly cleaves not only αII-spectrin, but also βII-spectrin, and that this process is accompanied by skeletal dissolution. Together, these results define the molecular targets of these two important protease systems on the spectrin skeleton and suggest a mechanism by which different proteases, acting at slightly different sites within spectrin, might alternatively induce either enhanced skeletal plasticity or membrane skeletal dissolution. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (SY5Y) were grown to confluence on 12-well plates (∼2 × 106 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml Fungizone (amphotericin B). Cultures were washed three times with serum-free minimum essential medium. After 1 h of preincubation with calpain inhibitor I (acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO, Calbiochem) or Z-D-DCB (a caspase inhibitor), cultures were challenged either with a 0.1 nm concentration of the calcium channel activator maitotoxin (28Wang K.K.W. Nath R. Raser K.J. Hajimohammadreza I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or with 0.5 μm staurosporine, each for 1 h (29Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, cultures were washed and returned to regular non-serum medium for 24 h, when cell viability was monitored or protein or DNA extraction was performed. Purified heteromeric bovine brain spectrin2 was digested with purified recombinant caspases (30Kamens J. Paskind M. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Allen H. Banach D. Bump N. Hackett M. Johnston C.G. Li P.

Digestion was halted by the addition of an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Triplicate samples were subjected to electrophoresis. One gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, whereas two were transferred to Immobilon® membranes and probed by Western blotting with anti-αII-spectrin (pAb RAF-A) and anti-βII-spectrin (pAb 10D) antibodies, respectively.2Similar experiments were also carried out on GST fusion peptides representing various regions of αII- and βII-spectrins, prepared and analyzed as described previously (32Lombardo C.R. Weed S.A. Kennedy S.P. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29212-29219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 GST-containing fusion peptides were also detected by Western blotting using anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After SDS-PAGE on either 8% polyacrylamide or 4–20% gradient gels, samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using 20 mm CAPS and 10% methanol (pH 11.0) for 60–75 min. The membrane was rinsed with water, stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue in 50% methanol, and destained briefly with 100% methanol. Upon drying, the bands of interest were cut from the blot and subjected to N-terminal determination using an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer. SY5Y cell death was assessed by measuring the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase released into the medium (25-μl samples) (39Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Alternatively, 40 μg/ml propidium iodide was added directly to the cell culture wells at 24 h, and fluorescence of the dye-DNA complex (excitation at 530 nm and emission at 620 nm) was measured after 5 min with a Millipore Cytoflor 2300 fluorescence plate reader. At the end of an experiment, the medium was first removed, and the attached cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline and 1 mm EDTA. Protein extraction was accomplished by cell lysis with SDS, followed by protein precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and solubilization with Tris base (33Wang K.K. Posner A. Hajimohammadreza I. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 662-668PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples were analyzed for protein concentration with a modified Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of total protein (15 μg) was loaded onto each lane and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4–20% acrylamide) with a Tris/glycine running buffer system and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μm) using a Tris/glycine buffer system in a semidry electrotransfer unit (Bio-Rad) at 20 mA for 1.5–2 h. αII-Spectrin was detected with monoclonal antibody 1622 (Chemicon International, Inc.), pAb RAF-A, or pAb RAF-B (34Harris A.S. Anderson J.P. Yurchenco P.D. Green L.A.D. Ainger K.J. Morrow J.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 30: 51-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). βII-Spectrin was detected by pAb 10D, raised against a recombinant βII-spectrin peptide representing repeat unit 13 to residue 2204 within domain III (βII13-CΔ) (32Lombardo C.R. Weed S.A. Kennedy S.P. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29212-29219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated second antibody and avidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The blots were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed using a color scanner (Umax UC630) and either the National Institutes of Health program Image 1.5 or the program ScanAnalysis (Biosoft) operating on an Apple Macintosh® computer. Nonlinear regression analysis was carried out using the Biosoft program Ultrafit (Version 3.0), also operating on a Macintosh®computer. Immunofluorescence studies employed SH-SY5Y cells cultured on German glass coverslips (Fisher) at medium density. At the desired time point upon staurosporine treatment (6 h, unless stated otherwise), cells from all experimental treatment groups were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 81 mmKCl, 1.6 mm Na2HPO4, and 14 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)). Cultures were first incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C for 2 h. Primary antibodies (anti-CPP32 and anti-poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase) in blocking solution (10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk) were incubated for 3 h at 25 °C. The cultures were then washed with blocking solution three times for 10 min. Secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG) linked to a specific fluorophore (fluorescein isothiocyanate) were applied for 2 h. The coverslips were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline solution, mounted on slides containing Elvanol (anti-fade agent, DuPont), and allowed to dry. Slides were stored in the dark prior to immunofluorescence microscopic examination. Control cultures without primary antibodies did not stain. Our previous studies have established that SY5Y cells subjected to staurosporine (0.5 μm) undergo apoptosis, with chromatin condensation and other stigmata of apoptosis appearing within 5–6 h. The number of cells dying in culture plateau within 16–24 h (12Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A. Allen H. Talanian R.V. Yuen P. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K.W. Biochem.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2328-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the current study, loss of intact αII- and βII-spectrin in staurosporine-treated cells was detected by 1 h and continued progressively for 24 h (Fig.1 A). This loss was mirrored by increased levels of αII-spectrin BDPs at ≈150, 145, and 120 kDa (αII-BDP150, αII-BDP145, and αII-BDP120, respectively). βII-Spectrin was also simultaneously degraded into two major immunoreactive fragments at ≈110 and 85 kDa (βII-BDP110 and βII-BDP85, respectively). A minor βII-BDP was also evident at ≈55 kDa (βII-BDP55) (Fig. 1 B). The time course of the breakdown of both αII- and βII-spectrins into their major cleavage fragments could be roughly modeled as a three-step kinetic process, in which each intact subunit (A) broke down to an intermediate product (B) and then was then further degraded to a smaller major product (C), with two corresponding rate constants, kAandkB (Equation 1).A→kAB→kBCEquation 1 Scaling data to unit maximum value for A (the starting value of αII- or βII-spectrin) and solving the resulting kinetic equation as a function of time (t) yield the relative amount of B or C (Equations 2 and 3).B=kAe−kAt−e−kBtkB−kAEquation 2 C=1−e−kAt−kAe−kAt−e−kBtkB−kAEquation 3 Fitting the observed breakdown patterns using Equations 2 and 3indicated that kA ≈ 0.17 h−1 (for generation of αII-BDP150) and that kB ≈ 0.12 h−1 (for generation of αII-BDP120) (Fig. 1 B). For βII-spectrin, the corresponding values were kA≈ 0.16 h−1 (for generation of βII-BDP110) andkB ≈ 0.03 h−1 (for generation of βII-BDP85). These rates correspond to half-lives (t½) for intact αII-spectrin of ≈2.9 h and for βII-spectrin of ≈3.1 h. The half-lives of the intermediates derived from these fits were ≈4.2 h for αII-BDP150 and ≈19.2 h for βII-BDP110. Although these t½ values tended to vary (±0.8 h) from experiment to experiment (data not shown), it was clear that unlike for calpain cleavage (19Harris A.S. Croall D.E. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17401-17408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),2 the time course of βII-spectrin breakdown by caspase 3 essentially paralleled that of αII-spectrin. Except for the transient generation of αII-BDP150, which can arise from proteolysis by several different proteases at a hypersensitive region within αII-spectrin repeat unit 11 (27Harris A.S. Croall D. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15754-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Harris A.S. Morrow J.S. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2640-2651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),2 the pattern of BDPs generated by staurosporine action in the SY5Y cells appeared to be distinct from those produced by calpain.2 To further define the nature of the protease cascade operating in these experiments, the effects of specific calpain and caspase inhibitors on staurosporine-induced breakdown were compared (Fig.2). Calpain inhibitor I specifically blocked the generation of αII-BDP145, but did not affect the generation of the major product, αII-BDP120 (Fig. 2 A). Conversely, Z-D-DCB, a caspase inhibitor, blocked the appearance of αII-BDP120. Both inhibitors slowed the overall generation of αII-BDPs, and thus, it appeared that both proteases contributed in some measure to the generation of αII-spectrin BDPs. With respect to βII-spectrin, calpain inhibitor I had little effect on βII-spectrin degradation compared with Z-D-DCB, which blocked the cleavage of βII-spectrin almost completely (Fig. 2 B). These patterns of cleavage were distinct from those induced in SY5Y cells by treatment with MTX (0.01 nm), a highly potent marine toxin that activates both voltage-sensitive and receptor-operated calcium channels in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Presumably, the intracellular calcium load induced by such treatment activates cell death pathways similar to those operating during necrosis (7Glantz S.B. Morrow J.S. Haddad G.G. Lister G. Tissue Oxygen Deprivation: Developmental, Molecular and Integrated Function. 95. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 153-192Google Scholar, 28Wang K.K.W. Nath R. Raser K.J. Hajimohammadreza I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). With MTX treatment, there was dramatic loss of both αII- and βII-spectrin coupled with the generation of αII-BDP150, βII-BDP110, and βII-BDP55. On the other hand, the αII-BDP120 and βII-BDP85 products, characteristic of caspase 3 activity, were not formed. Z-D-DCB provided minimal protection, whereas calpain inhibitor I almost completely blocked both αII- and βII-spectrin breakdown in MTX-treated cells (Fig. 2). A βII-spectrin cleavage product of ≈110 kDa observed with MTX is similar in size to the caspase-generated βII-BDP110; based on the lack of βII-BDP85 as well as the inhibition of this cleavage by calpain inhibitor I, it appears that this band is a calpain product. These data, together with our earlier studies (12Nath R. Raser K.J. Stafford D. Hajimohammadreza I. Posner A. Allen H. Talanian R.V. Yuen P. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 28Wang K.K.W. Nath R. Raser K.J. Hajimohammadreza I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicate that staurosporine and MTX activate in large measure distinct pathways of spectrin proteolytic cleavage in SY5Y cells. These pathways appear to be characteristic of apoptotic and non-apoptotic (necrotic) cell death, respectively, and both involve cleavage of βII-spectrin as part of the cell death event. The pattern of spectrin degradation during staurosporine-induced apoptosis in SY5Y cells and the response of these cells to Z-D-DCB strongly implicated a caspase in the apoptotic breakdown of spectrin. Since several related caspases may be active during apoptosis (37Faleiro L. Kobayashi R. Fearnhead H. Lazebnik Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine their relative activity against spectrin in the milieu of SY5Y cells. Cell lysates were thus digested for 1 h with comparable amounts of recombinant human caspases 1–4, 6, and 7, and the breakdown patterns were analyzed after Western blotting (Fig. 3). As expected, all caspases generated αII-BDP150, presumably due to cleavage within αII-spectrin's hypersensitive site. In contrast, only caspase 3 produced significant levels of αII-BDP120. All caspases also readily digested βII-spectrin, but differed significantly in the ratio of the major βII-spectrin fragments generated (Fig. 3). For example, the dominant products generated by caspases 2, 3, 6, and 7 were βII-BDP70, βII-BDP85, βII-BDP55, and βII-BDP110, respectively. Again, only caspase 3 produced significant levels of both βII-BDP110 and βII-BDP85. While additional βII-spectrin BDPs no doubt existed in these experiments that were not visualized by pAb 10D (which is directed to the C-terminal third of βII-spectrin), these findings establish that caspases display characteristic differences in their relative specificity and activityvis-á-vis spectrin. Variations in the amount of active enzyme or in the enzyme/substrate ratios are unlikely to be a factor in these experiments since even in the very same experiment (e.g. with caspase 2; Fig. 3), a protease that displayed minimal activity against αII-spectrin often showed the greatest activity against βII-spectrin. Interestingly, αII-BDP120, βII-BDP110, and βII-BDP85, the spectrin fragments most prominent in apoptotic SY5Y cells (cf. Fig. 1), are characteristic of caspase 3 action (Fig. 3). Conversely, neither μ-calpain nor m-calpain, even when added to the SY5Y lysates, generated these fragments. Taken together, these data indicate that caspase 3 is the dominant protease mediating spectrin cleavage in staurosporine-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma SY5Y cells. The sites of calpain cleavage in both αII- and βII-spectrin have been identified (27Harris A.S. Croall D. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15754-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 To identify the precise sites at which caspase 3 cleaves spectrin, purified bovine brain αII/βII-spectrin was digested in vitro, and the resulting digestion products were analyzed by Western blotting and N-terminal microsequencing. Caspase 3 generated multiple spectrin fragments ranging from ≈165 to ≈85 kDa on Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Fig. 4). Two of these products (αII-BDP150 and αII-BDP120) reacted with monoclonal antibody 1622, indicating their origin from the αII-subunit. Conversely, pAb 10D detected βII-fragments at ≈110, ≈100, ≈85, and ≈55 kDa. Only the Coomassie Blue-stained fragment at ≈165 kDa was unaccounted for on the Western blots; presumably this represents a βII-spectrin N-terminal fragment that was not detected by pAb 10D. Collectively, the in vitro caspase 3 digestion products were almost identical to those observed in staurosporine-induced SY5Y cells (except for the αII-BDP145 generated by calpain). N-terminal sequencing identified the origin of several major caspase 3-generated fragments. Due to the presence of multiple bands of very similar molecular mass, the identity of some fragments proved difficult to obtain. These results (in which at least six terminal residues could be determined with confidence) are summarized in TableI and in Fig. 8. The αII-BDP150 fragment mapped to the sequence DETD1185*S1186KTASP in repeat 11 (with * representing the site of cleavage and the beginning point of the determined sequences). This site is just distal to the major calpain cleavage site (VY1176*G1177MMP) and immediately proximal to the calmodulin-binding domain (residues 1187–1206) (27Harris A.S. Croall D. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15754-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also likely that the N-terminal half of αII-spectrin was present within the αII-BDP150 band, based on analogy with the cleavage of αII-spectrin by calpain (7Glantz S.B. Morrow J.S. Haddad G.G. Lister G. Tissue Oxygen Deprivation: Developmental, Molecular and Integrated Function. 95. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 153-192Google Scholar, 36Harris A.S. Morrow J.S. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2640-2651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 However, given the blocked N terminus of αII-spectrin, this fragment did not appear in the microsequencing results. The αII-BDP120 fragment mapped to a second caspase 3 cleavage site (DSLD1478*S1479EALIKKHE) in repeat 14 of αII-spectrin. The fragment liberated from αII-BDP150 to yield αII-BDP120 appeared in αII-BDP35 (Table I). Both the βII-BDP110 and βII-BDP85 fragments shared a common N-terminal sequence, placing this site of cleavage in repeat 11 of βII-spectrin (DEVD1457*S1458KRLTVQT). Reliable sequence information was not obtained from βII-BDP55 due to its low abundance.Table IMajor caspase 3-generated spectrin fragmentsFragmentN-terminal sequencePredicted cleavage siteAssumed endCalculated MrNative protein αII-BDP150′ aIt is likely that a second cleavage product also is present in the αII-BDP150 band, representing αII-spectrin residues 1–1185; this product (αII-BDP150′) cannot be detected by end sequencing since the N terminus of spectrin is methylated.(MDPSGVKVLE)(Start of αII-spectrin, assumed)Asp1185"

The PH-20 protein is normally expressed only in mammalian testis. However, it has recently been shown that this enzyme is present in some tumor cells (10Liu D. Pearlman E. Diaconu E. Guo K. Mori H. Haqqi T. Markowitz S. Wilson J. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7832-7837Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A related hyaluronidase termed HYAL1, which is present in human serum, has recently been characterized (11Frost G.I. Csóka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).In recent years, several partial cDNA sequences have been deposited in the data banks that are derived from genes that potentially code for polypeptides related to the PH-20 hyaluronidase. Three of these genes are located close to each other on chromosome region 3p21.3 (12Latif F. Duh F.M. Bader S. Sekido Y. Li H. Geil L. Zbar B. Minna J.D. Lerman M.I. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This region is deleted in some cell lines from small cell carcinomas of the lung (13Daly M.C. Xiang R.H. Buchhagen D. Hensel C.H. Garcia D.K. Killary A.M. Minna J.D. Naylor S.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar). The genes were thus provisionally termed LuCa-1, -2, and -3. The serum enzyme HYAL1 is the product of the LuCa-1 gene (11Frost G.I. Csóka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Starting from commercially available ESTs we have now assembled the complete LuCa-2cDNA. Expression of this cDNA yields a hyaluronidase with a rather unusual substrate specificity, which is located in lysosomes. It is proposed to replace the term LuCa-2 by HYAL2for both the gene and its product.DISCUSSIONThe human HYAL2 cDNA encodes a mature polypeptide of 452 amino acids that shows 36.5% identity with the PH-20 hyaluronidase present on the head of spermatozoa. At the nucleotide level, the identity is 43.1%. The HYAL2 gene is located on chromosome 3p21.3 in a region that is deleted in most small cell carcinomas of the lung as well as other tumor cells (12Latif F. Duh F.M. Bader S. Sekido Y. Li H. Geil L.

The hyaluronidase present in mouse (24Sampson P.M. Rochester C.L. Freundlich B. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1492-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and human (11Frost G.I. Csóka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) serum was termed HYAL1 earlier. This enzyme is apparently secreted by a variety of cells.The human HYAL2 gene is expressed in all cells tested, the sole exception being adult brain. It is noteworthy that several of the ESTs encoding part of the HYAL2 enzyme have been isolated from infant human brain. The expression of the HYAL2 gene may thus be developmentally regulated. Indeed, the mouse HYAL2 mRNA is present in brains from embryos but disappears for unknown reasons soon after birth. 2G. Lepperdinger, B. Strobl, and G. Kreil, unpublished experiments.Using recombinant vv, the HYAL2 protein has been expressed in several cell lines; here we present the results obtained with HeLa and C6 glioma cell. The HYAL2 cDNA codes for a preprotein with an amino-terminal signal peptide, yet the protein is not secreted into the media to a measurable extent. The product of this gene is a soluble hyaluronidase that resembles the lysosomal enzyme present in HeLa cells. Both have a pH optimum below 4 and react with the same antiserum. A fusion protein of HYAL2 and EGFP could be shown to be localized in lysosomes of C6 glioma cells. We conclude from these results that HYAL2 encodes a lysosomal hyaluronidase present in many cell types.It was apparent from initial turbidity measurements that the activity of HYAL2 was rather low compared with that of the testicular PH-20 enzyme. Subsequent experiments with a gel electrophoresis assay yielded a totally unexpected result. The HYAL2 enzyme hydrolyzed only HA of high molecular mass, as is present in umbilical cord, rooster comb, and the coat of a Streptococcus strain. The reaction product was a polysaccharide of about 20 kDa, which corresponds to 50–60 disaccharide units. After heating and rapid cooling, no further hydrolysis by freshly added HYAL2 enzyme could be observed. However, upon subsequent addition of the PH-20 enzyme, this intermediate was quantitatively degraded to small oligosaccharides. HA of smaller size as well as a synthetic product made in vitro with the DG42 HA synthase were not degraded to a detectable extent by the HYAL2 enzyme. A similar finding has been reported by Sampson et al. (24Sampson P.M. Rochester C.L. Freundlich B. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1492-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), who showed that human fibroblasts contain a hyaluronidase that degrades high molecular weight HA to products with a size of 10–40 kDa. Interestingly, in these experiments, binding of HA to the cells appeared to be rate-limiting for degradation.The results obtained with the HYAL2 enzyme are of some interest from both a structural and a functional point of view. First, it appears that ordered domains are present in HA, which are resistant to the action of the HYAL2 enzyme. HA is a linear polymer that behaves in solution as a random coil containing large amounts of solvent (25Laurent T.C. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). However, the flexibility of this coil is locally reduced by the presence of hydrogen bonds (26Scott J.E. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 6-15PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, several groups have presented evidence that HA chains can form a complex network containing numerous helical structures (27Arnott S. Mitra A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Scott J.E. Cummings C. Greiling H. Stuhlsatz H.W. Gregory J.D. Damle S.P. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1990; 12: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Antiparallel helices have indeed been observed in x-ray diffraction studies with HA films (29Mitra A.K. Arnott S. Sheehan J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Evidence from physico-chemical studies suggests that similar structures exist in HA solutions (25Laurent T.C. CIBA Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar, 30Scott J.E. Cummings C. Brass A. Chen Y. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Our results on the activity of the HYAL2 enzyme provide the first biochemical data in support of defined domains in HA.Second, HA fragments generated by the HYAL2 enzyme may have distinct biological functions. One could be the stimulation of angiogenesis, which has been observed in different experimental situations (10Liu D. Pearlman E. Diaconu E. Guo K. Mori H. Haqqi T. Markowitz S. Wilson J. Sy M.S.

Science. 1985; 228: 1324-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is of some interest that HA fragments can induce the expression of enzymes such as nitric oxide synthase via a NF-κB/I-κBα autoregulatory loop in murine macrophages (32Noble P.W. McKee C.M. Cowman M. Shin H.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2373-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 33McKee C.M. Lowenstein C.J. Horton M.R. Wu J. Bao C. Clin B.Y. Choi A.M.K. Noble P.W. J.

Hyaluronidases have been isolated from many different sources such as mammalian testes and serum, snake and insect venoms, salivary glands of leeches, and pathogenic streptococci (1Frost G.I.

These enzymes degrade hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HAhyaluronan (hyaluronic acid)PCRpolymerase chain reactionESTexpressed sequence tagvvvaccinia virusEGFPgreen fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: HAhyaluronan (hyaluronic acid)PCRpolymerase chain reactionESTexpressed sequence tagvvvaccinia virusEGFPgreen fluorescent protein.), a glycosaminoglycan present in the extracellular matrix of vertebrates to oligosaccharides (4Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar). The sequences of two related hyaluronidases from animal cells have recently be elucidated via cDNA cloning. These are the enzymes from honeybee venom (5Gmachl M. Kreil G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3569-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and from mammalian testis (6Gmachl M.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The testicular enzyme originally termed PH-20 (8Lathrop W.F. Carmichael E.P. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) is located at the head of the sperm; upon contact with the egg, it hydrolyzes the HA present in its outermost cumulus layer (9Cherr G.N.

The PH-20 protein is normally expressed only in mammalian testis. However, it has recently been shown that this enzyme is present in some tumor cells (10Liu D. Pearlman E. Diaconu E. Guo K. Mori H. Haqqi T. Markowitz S. Wilson J. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7832-7837Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A related hyaluronidase termed HYAL1, which is present in human serum, has recently been characterized (11Frost G.I. Csóka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid) polymerase chain reaction expressed sequence tag vaccinia virus green fluorescent protein. hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid) polymerase chain reaction expressed sequence tag vaccinia virus green fluorescent protein. In recent years, several partial cDNA sequences have been deposited in the data banks that are derived from genes that potentially code for polypeptides related to the PH-20 hyaluronidase. Three of these genes are located close to each other on chromosome region 3p21.3 (12Latif F. Duh F.M. Bader S. Sekido Y. Li H. Geil L. Zbar B. Minna J.D. Lerman M.I. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This region is deleted in some cell lines from small cell carcinomas of the lung (13Daly M.C. Xiang R.H. Buchhagen D. Hensel C.H. Garcia D.K. Killary A.M. Minna J.D. Naylor S.L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar). The genes were thus provisionally termed LuCa-1, -2, and -3. The serum enzyme HYAL1 is the product of the LuCa-1 gene (11Frost G.I. Csóka T.B. Wong T. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Starting from commercially available ESTs we have now assembled the complete LuCa-2cDNA. Expression of this cDNA yields a hyaluronidase with a rather unusual substrate specificity, which is located in lysosomes. It is proposed to replace the term LuCa-2 by HYAL2for both the gene and its product. DISCUSSIONThe human HYAL2 cDNA encodes a mature polypeptide of 452 amino acids that shows 36.5% identity with the PH-20 hyaluronidase present on the head of spermatozoa. At the nucleotide level, the identity is 43.1%. The HYAL2 gene is located on chromosome 3p21.3 in a region that is deleted in most small cell carcinomas of the lung as well as other tumor cells (12Latif F. Duh F.M. Bader S. Sekido Y. Li H. Geil L.

Thrombin fully protects cells from this inductive effect of cAMP through the thrombin receptor. The protective effect of thrombin was shown to be Rho-dependent. Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which inactivates RhoA functions, abolished the ability of thrombin to protect cells from responding to increased cAMP levels. A constitutively activated RhoAV14 mutant protein also prevented cells from responding to cAMP. RhoA can be specifically phosphorylated at Ser-188 by the cAMP-activated protein kinase A (PKA). We demonstrate that RhoAV14A188, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro, is more effective than RhoAV14 in preventing cells from responding to cAMP and in inducing actin stress fiber formation. This suggests that PKA phosphorylation of RhoA impairs its biological activity in vivo. ROKα, a RhoA-associated serine/threonine kinase can also prevent cells from responding to cAMP with shape changes. Phosphorylation of RhoA by PKA in vitro decreases the binding of RhoA to ROKα. These results indicate that RhoA and cAMP have antagonistic roles in regulating cellular morphology and suggest that cAMP-mediated down-regulation of RhoA binding to its effector ROKα may be involved in this antagonism.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 707-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in certain cells individual Rho-family GTPases may exert different morphological roles. For example, in KB cells, RhoA rather than Rac1 was shown to be involved in mediating membrane ruffling induced by hepatocyte growth factor and phorbol ester (9Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). An increasing number of Rho-family GTPase-associated proteins have been discovered within the last few years (for review see Ref. 10Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) including serine/threonine kinases. With regard to morphology, these kinases appear to act as downstream effectors of the GTPases (11Lim L. Hall C. Monfries C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 699-706Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Among them, a Rho-binding serine/threonine kinase, ROK (12Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N.

Neural cells, which can undergo differentiation in vitro,display marked changes in their morphology, some of which may reflect structural reorganization required for specific functional needs. For example, mature astrocytes in vivo have multiple elongated processes that are thought to be critical for their physiological functions. Astrocytes prepared from neonatal cerebral hemispheres or cerebella can undergo dramatic shape changes in tissue culture resulting in a stellated appearance similar to their in vivomorphology when exposed either to live neurons (16Hatten M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) or cAMP analogues such as dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) (17Baorto D.M. Mellado W. Shelanski M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Goldman J.E. Chiu F. Brain Res. 1984; 306: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). cAMP, as an intracellular second messenger, plays important roles in many aspects of nerve system functions. It has been shown recently that cAMP can induce the switching of directional turning of nerve growth cones in response to a gradient of diffusible factors, such as brain-derived growth factor, netrin-1, and acetylcholine (19Song H.-J. Ming G.-L. Poo M.-M. Nature. 1997; 388: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 20Ming G.-L. Song H.-J. Berninger B. Holt C.E. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M.-M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1225-1235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The gradient of these molecules normally triggers an attractive turning response of growth cones. But when intracellular cAMP levels are reduced, the same gradient induces a repulsive turning response, which suggests that cAMP functions as a gate element in the pathfinding of neurite outgrowth. However, the mechanisms underlying these morphological changes are still poorly understood. Thrombin, a multi-functional protein including serine proteinase activity, has a remarkable ability to interact with a large variety of cell types and rapidly elicits a range of physiological responses. Thrombin can cause rapid neurite retraction in neuronal cells by activation of its cell surface receptors (21Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Suidan H.S. Stone S.R. Hemmings A. Monard D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 363-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a comparable response has also been demonstrated in cells of glial lineage (23Cavanaugh K.P. Gurwitz D. Cunningham D.D. Bradshaw R.A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The thrombin-stimulated neurite retraction in N1E-115 and PC12 neuronal-like cells has been shown to involve RhoA (24Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The link between thrombin receptor activation and Rho activation is as yet unknown. Many human neuroblastomas are tumors of early childhood derived from the neural crest, usually comprising a variety of cell types ranging from neuroblasts to melanocytes, glial cells and chondrocytes. Cell lines established from several of these tumors exhibit a similar diversity in their morphology and biochemical properties (25Ciccarone V. Spengler B.A. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar). For example, both epithelial-like SH-EP cells with properties reminiscent of a melanocytic, Schwannian, and/or meningeal cell type and neuronal-like SH-SY cells are derived from the same human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line (26Ross R.A. Spengler B.A. Biedler J.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1983; 71: 741-747PubMed Google Scholar). These two cell types appear to be capable of interconversion, a phenomenon called transdifferentiation (27Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Meyers M.B. Rozen M. Spengler B.A. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1984; 25: 41Google Scholar). We report here that treatment of SH-EP cells by forskolin, Bt2cAMP, or isoproterenol, which raise intracellular cAMP levels, caused rapid and transient cell morphological changes manifesting a stellate appearance. These treated cells round-up, leaving behind many of their processes. On the other hand, thrombin completely prevented SH-EP cells from responding to forskolin treatment morphologically. Microinjection of the constitutively activated RhoAV14 also effectively prevented cells from undergoing these cAMP-induced shape changes. The double mutant RhoAV14A188 with an alanine substituting the serine at position 188, which is specifically phosphorylated by the cAMP-activated protein kinase PKA in vitro (28Lang P. Resbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), exerted a greater protective effect. ROKα also prevented cells from undergoing these cAMP-induced shape changes. ROKα was found to bind less of the RhoA upon phosphorylation of RhoA by PKA in vitro. Our results indicate that RhoA and cAMP have antagonistic roles in regulating cellular morphology and suggest that down-regulation of RhoA binding to effector ROKα may be involved in this antagonism. RhoA cDNA was cloned into pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as pGEX-2TRhowt. PCR mediated mutagenesis was carried out to create pGEX-2TRhoA188, pGEX-2TRhoAV14, and pGEX-2TRhoAV14A188. RhoAA188 was also cloned into pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which contains an internal PKA phosphorylation site. The plasmids were sequenced before use for protein expression. The binding domain of ROKα was cloned into the pMAL vector (New England Biolabs) and C-terminally truncated ROKα cDNA was cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pXJ40HA to create construct pXJ40HAROKΔC as described previously (6Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins using the pGEX-2T or pGEX-2TK vectors. Proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (29Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The proteins were released from the beads by thrombin cleavage and dialyzed against microinjection buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT) after removing thrombin by benzamidine-Sepharose beads. The uncleaved GST-fusion proteins were also obtained as in vitro phosphorylation material by eluting from beads with reduced glutathione. Protein preparations showed essentially only one band on Coomassie blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay reagent and Coomassie blue staining. SH-EP cells and SK-N-SH cells were grown on ethanol-washed glass, with a cross for relocation of microinjected cells, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose plus 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C to subconfluence before treatment with various agents or microinjection. Recombinant and purified proteins were microinjected into the cytoplasm using an Eppendorf microinjector and Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Microinjection was performed within 10 min. Within this time frame, normally 30–60 cells could be successfully injected. To locate the injected cells, different concentrations of recombinant proteins were co-injected with rabbit IgG at 0.2–0.4 mg/ml. Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was co-injected at 0.16 mg/ml. After microinjection, cells were cultured in serum-free medium or serum-free medium containing 20 μm forskolin or other intracellular cAMP-elevating agents as indicated for 1 h before fixation. The plasmid pXJ40HAROKΔC (50 ng/ml) was injected into nuclei. 2 h after injection, cells were cultured in serum-free medium containing 20 μm forskolin for 1 h before fixation. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Cells were then stained with 1:100 FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (visualizing the injected cells) and 50 ng/ml TRITC-labeled phalloidin (visualizing filamentous actin) for 1 h at room temperature, washed in 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline two times for 5 min each. FITC-conjugated anti-hemagglutinin antibody was used to locate recombinant ROK-expressing cells. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss fluorescent microscope, and photographed with Kodak T-MAX 400 or Ektachrome 400 film, or viewed on an MRC 600 confocal imager. Phosphorylation of RhoA by PKAin vitro was carried out as described previously (28Lang P. Resbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST-fusion proteins were preloaded with either GDP or GTPγS before being bound to glutathione beads. Phosphorylation by PKA (10 units, catalytic subunit, Sigma) was carried out in a 25-μl final volume of phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by extensively washing with cold phosphorylation buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. 0.2 μg of each purified GST-fusion protein from pGEX-2TRhoAwt and pGEX-2TKRhoAA188was bound to glutathione beads and phosphorylated by PKA as described above in the presence of 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for GST-RhoAwt or 0.1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP for GST-K/RhoAA188, because the phosphorylation site provided by pGEX-2TK is a more preferable one than Ser-188 of RhoA. After washing with cold phosphorylation buffer once and cold exchange buffer (50 mm NaCl, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1.25 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm DTT, and 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) twice, the beads were loaded with 10 μCi [35S]GTPγS in 20 μl of exchange buffer at room temperature for 5 min. The beads were then washed with 1 ml of stopping buffer (50 mm NaCl, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, and 0.05% Triton X-100) for 5 times. The fusion proteins were eluted by reduced glutathione in 320 μl of stopping buffer. 20 μl of eluate were radioassayed using a dual label mode on a LKB 1219 Rackbata liquid scintillation counter. To eliminate overlapping of 35S and32P spectrums, the window 1 for 35S was narrowed to 5–450, and window 2 for 32P to 500–900. The remaining eluate was incubated with 5 μg of maltose-binding protein-fused ROK binding domain (6Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which had been prebound to 50 μl of maltose beads, in the presence of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were then washed with 1 ml of washing buffer (50 mm NaCl, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.05% Triton X-100) for 3 times and directly counted using a dual label mode. SH-EP cells cultivated in serum-free medium for 1 h manifested epithelia-like morphology (Fig. 1 A). The cells were flat and appeared to be tightly adherent to the culture matrix. Treatment with isoproterenol (0.1 μm), an agonist of the β-adrenergic receptor, resulted in a rapid morphological change. Flattened cell bodies started to round-up leaving many long processes (referred to as “cAMP phenotype”) as early as 10–15 min after addition of the drug. Maximal effects were observed within 1 h. The effects of isoproterenol resulted from increased intracellular cAMP levels, as it can activate adenylate cyclase activity via β-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, treatment with either forskolin (20 μm), a direct adenylate cyclase activator, or dibutyryl cAMP (2 mm), a permeable cAMP analogue, elicited similar cell shape changes over the same time scale (Fig.1 B). IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine), a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor that inhibits cAMP degradation, potentiated the effects of isoproterenol, forskolin, and dibutyryl-cAMP (data not shown). This change was transient because by 10–13 h, cells regained their original shape (Fig. 1 C). These reflattened cells became desensitized, because further treatment with forskolin caused no subsequent morphological change. These morphological effects did not occur in parental SK-N-SH cells or another subclonal line, SH-SY cells, which are neuronal-like in morphology. Co-treatment with thrombin (0.001 units/ml) completely blocked the morphological effects of forskolin; treated cells showed only slight contraction of the cell body when compared with controls (Fig. 2, A and B), which was also observed with thrombin treatment alone. Continuous exposure was not required for thrombin to exert its protective effect. No cAMP phenotype was observed when cells were transiently treated with thrombin for 10 min, followed by forskolin treatment in fresh medium for 1 h (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the protective effects of thrombin were caused by nonspecific protease activity, another serine protease, trypsin, was also tested. At concentrations up to 0.1 units/ml, trypsin did not prevent cells from responding to forskolin treatment (data not shown). SFLL, a 14-amino acid peptide derived from residues 42–55 of the thrombin receptor, can duplicate all the actions of thrombin itself (30Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, inclusion of 10 μmSFLL in the medium completely blocked the morphological effect of forskolin. Thus thrombin antagonizes the effect of increased cAMP levels via activation of its receptor. Rho mediates LPA-induced stress fiber formation (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). To test if thrombin can also induce actin stress fiber formation in SH-EP cells, cells were cultured in serum-free medium with or without 0.001 units/ml thrombin for 1 h. Control cells contained some thin stress fibers. Upon exposure to thrombin, large amounts of stress fibers were formed that were much thicker and denser (Fig. 2, D and E). This induction of stress fiber formation was observed as early as 10 min after thrombin treatment (data not shown). Microinjection of the Rho inhibitor C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme (0.16 mg/ml) completely blocked thrombin-activated stress fiber formation and dissolved existing stress fibers (Fig. 2, F and G). These results show Rho pathways to be implicated in thrombin-induced stress fiber formation in SH-EP cells and suggest an involvement of Rho in thrombin antagonism of cAMP effects. To test directly for RhoA involvement in the cAMP-induced cell shape changes, subconfluent SH-EP cells were microinjected with a constitutively activated RhoAV14 recombinant protein (1 mg/ml). Cells were then treated with 20 μm forskolin for 1 h before fixation. Injected cells were identified by immunostaining of co-injected rabbit IgG. RhoAV14effectively prevented cells from undergoing the cAMP-induced cell shape changes. As shown in Fig. 3, Aand B, the RhoAV14 injected cells maintained their shape after forskolin treatment. Massive stress fibers were formed (a typical Rho effect). The neighboring uninjected cells lost their stress fibers leaving diffused actin filaments around the cell body and in remaining processes. Co-injection of C3 exoenzyme with RhoAV14 completely abolished these Rho-mediated effects (Fig. 3, C and D). To quantify these effects, injected cells were identified and scored, based on their morphology after treatment with forskolin for 1 h. Those cells remaining in flattened cell shapes scored as no morphological change; those showing complete rounding up of the cell body with multiple processes scored as cAMP phenotype, and those with partially shrunk cell body bearing some branches scored as intermediate phenotype. As shown in Fig. 4, whereas >95% of RhoAV14-injected cells showed no morphological change upon forskolin treatment, less than 10% of control IgG-injected cells exhibited no morphological change. In RhoAV14 and C3 exoenzyme co-injected cells, more than 80% exhibited cAMP phenotype. These results imply that inactivation of RhoA may be one mechanism underlying the morphological changes induced by elevated intracellular cAMP levels. Elevated intracellular cAMP levels trigger signal-transduction pathways through activation of PKA, which phosphorylates many target proteins. One such target identified is RhoA, phosphorylated on Ser-188 (28Lang P. Resbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), although the biological consequence of this RhoA phosphorylation in vivo was not reported. Recombinant GST-RhoAwt fusion protein was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA in vitro(Fig. 5 A). However, the GST-RhoAA188 protein, with Ser-188 mutated to Ala-188 was not phosphorylated by PKA, confirming previous findings that PKA specifically phosphorylates Ser-188 of RhoA (28Lang P. Resbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although both can be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro, GDP-preloaded RhoA is a relatively better substrate than GTPγS-preloaded RhoA, which suggests that the phosphorylation of RhoA in vivo may be regulated depending on whether it is in an active or inactive state. To test the morphological consequences of RhoA phosphorylation, different concentrations of RhoAV14 or RhoAV14A188 proteins were microinjected into SH-EP cells which were then challenged with forskolin. If phosphorylation of RhoA does indeed down-regulate RhoA activity, loss of the Ser-188 phosphorylation site should enhance the protective effects of RhoA against forskolin (acting through cAMP activation of PKA). Injected cells were identified and scored as described before with the results expressed as the percentage of the injected cells with no morphological change (Fig. 5 B). The protective effect of RhoAV14 was concentration-dependent; the majority of RhoAV14-injected cells (>90%) remained flattened upon forskolin treatment at concentrations of 0.8–1 mg/ml, and <20% of RhoAV14-injected cells showed no morphological change below 0.6 mg/ml. At a concentration below 0.3 mg/ml, RhoAV14 was totally ineffective in protecting cells from the effects of forskolin. By contrast, more than 90% of cells were protected when injected with this concentration of RhoAV14A188. Even at concentrations as low as 0.18 mg/ml, 50% of RhoAV14A188-injected cells remained flattened. To confirm that the phosphorylation of RhoA itself also blocks stress fiber formation, SK-N-SH cells were used for microinjection experiment. Unlike SH-EP cells, upon forskolin treatment, SK-N-SH cells do not round-up but shrink slightly, thus changes in actin cytoskeletal structure are more easily observed. These SK-N-SH cells contain some basal stress fibers; these fibers are significantly reduced and often completely lost upon forskolin treatment (data not shown). Injection of RhoAV14 protein (0.6 mg/ml) potently induced stress fiber formation in control SK-N-SH cells (Fig.6 A) but not in forskolin-treated cells (Fig. 6 C). However, RhoAV14A188 protein, even when injected at lower concentrations (0.3 mg/ml), was able to induce stress fiber formation in forskolin-treated cells (Fig. 6 E). These results confirm that PKA antagonizes the biological activity of RhoA through phosphorylation of RhoA. ROKα was recently shown to direct the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton with microinjection of an expression vector encoding ROKα, promoting formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes in HeLa and fibroblast cells (6Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether ROKα is also involved in cAMP-induced morphological changes in SH-EP cells, an expression vector encoding hyperactive ROKαΔC (6Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was microinjected into SH-EP cells, which were then challenged with forskolin. As shown in Fig.7, expression of ROKα stimulated actin stress fiber formation in SH-EP cells and protected cells against the morphological effects of forskolin (see neighboring cells). These results are consistent with ROKα acting downstream of RhoA because both proteins promoted stress fiber formation and protected against the effects of forskolin. Although phosphorylation of RhoA by PKA does not affect its binding of GTP (see Ref. 28Lang P. Resbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar; and data not shown), we wondered whether this could lead to down-regulation of its interaction with the effector ROKα. Because PKA phosphorylates RhoA poorly in vitro (Ref. 28Lang P. Resbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar; and data not shown), analysis of ROK binding of phosphorylated RhoA using radiolabeled GTP-RhoA as substrate (6Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) will be confounded by the presence of larger amounts of unphosphorylated RhoA. We therefore used a double-labeling method to determine whether phosphorylation of RhoA affected its interaction with ROKα. GST-RhoAwt and control GST-K-RhoAA188 containing the polylinker PKA phosphorylation site were first phosphorylated by PKA with [γ-32P]ATP. The 32P-labeled proteins were subsequently loaded with [35S]GTPγS. 32P- and 35S-radioactivity associated with GST-RhoAwt or GST-K-RhoAA188 was simultaneously determined, before and after the proteins were bound to the immobilized binding domain of ROKα (Fig. 8). If PKA phosphorylation of RhoA inhibits its binding to ROKα, the32P/35S ratio should be lower in RhoA upon binding to ROKα beads, as less of the 32P-phosphorylated RhoA will contribute to the population of [35S]GTPγS-RhoA, which was bound to ROKα. On the other hand, if phosphorylation has no effect on binding of RhoA to ROKα, the 32P/35S ratio should be similar in RhoA before and after binding to ROKα. Fig. 8 shows that the32P/35S ratio in such an experiment decreased 50% when proteins containing [35S]GTPγS- and32P-labeled RhoAwt were bound to ROKα. In contrast, this ratio was essentially unaltered when proteins containing [35S]GTPγS- and 32P-labeled RhoAA188 was bound to ROKα. These results indicate that RhoA upon its phosphorylation by PKA may have decreased binding to ROKα. They also imply that cAMP-induced changes may be mediated through PKA down-regulation of RhoA binding to ROKα. Neuron and astroglial cell differentiation are accompanied by dramatic morphological changes over sustained periods in vivo and in cell culture. Similar morphological changes known as arborization or stellation can be rapidly induced in some animal cells, including astrocytes (17Baorto D.M. Mellado W. Shelanski M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), mesangial cells (31Kreisberg J.I. Venkatachalam M.A. Patel P.Y. Kidney Int. 1984; 25: 874-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), fibroblasts (32Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. Conti M.A. Adelstein R. Glass D.B. Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1955-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and osteoblastic cells (33Egan J.J. Gronowicz G. Rodan G.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) in culture by increasing the intracellular cAMP level, which itself often acts as a differentiation agent. The diversity of cell types exhibiting similar responses to cAMP suggests its fundamental involvement in regulating cytoskeleton/membrane events. We report in this study that the epithelia-like SH-EP cell line can also undergo rapid and reversible cell shape changes, characterized by a stellate appearance, upon increasing intracellular cAMP levels. It has been reported that SH-EP cells can interconvert into neuronal-like cell types at low frequency (27Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Meyers M.B. Rozen M. Spengler B.A. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1984; 25: 41Google Scholar). Because the morphology of treated SH-EP cells that have undergone cAMP-induced cell shape changes resembles that of some neurons, we tested for the appearance of mRNA for neurofilament, a neuronal marker, which is absent in normal SH-EP cells. These cells did not contain neurofilament mRNA unlike its sibling neuronal-like SH-SY cells (data not shown). These results coupled with the reversion of morphological changes with time showed that cAMP was not promoting transdifferentiation but rather inducing transient effects in SH-EP cells. The cAMP-induced changes cannot be evoked when cells are grown in the presence of serum even as low as 1%, indicating that some factors in serum can antagonize the cAMP effect. Curiously, LPA, a serum activator of Rho (34Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) did not prevent cells from responding to forskolin-induced changes in serum-starved SH-EP cells (data not shown). Our study shows another serum component, thrombin, to prevent forskolin and other intracellular cAMP-elevating agents from inducing morphological changes. In line with other studies (30Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar), our data suggests that thrombin functions through a specific receptor, as a peptide agonist of the thrombin receptor, SFLL exhibits the same protective effect. In SH-EP cells thrombin may induce stress fiber formation via a Rho pathway in a manner analogous to the LPA-induced pathway in fibroblasts. In support of this Rho mediation, we have found the protective ability of thrombin to antagonize forskolin action to be abrogated when SH-EP cells were first microinjected with C3 exoenzyme (data not shown). However, microinjection of C3 exoenzyme alone cannot mimic cAMP-induced morphological changes (Fig. 2, F andG; and data not shown), which indicates that inactivation of RhoA alone may not be sufficient for the full responsiveness of cAMP treatment. On the other hand, microinjection of constitutively activated RhoAV14 mimics the thrombin effect in blocking cAMP-induced morphological changes. Thrombin- or LPA-activated signal-transduction pathways and the cAMP second messenger system have been documented as playing opposing roles. For example, in neuronal cells, thrombin and LPA both rapidly trigger neurite retraction by activating their respective receptors (21Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Suidan H.S. Stone S.R. Hemmings A. Monard D.

Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 247-255PubMed Google Scholar). Rho has been shown to be a component in these signal transduction pathways (24Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Conversely, cAMP can promote neurite outgrowth (36Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the cAMP effects in SH-EP cells may involve inactivation of Rho by PKA phosphorylation. However, other mechanisms by which cAMP negatively modulates RhoA activity may also exist. Recently, Laudanna et al. (37Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24141-24144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) have shown that pre-elevation of the intracellular level of cAMP prevents chemoattractant-stimulated RhoA GDP/GTP exchange in lymphoid cells. Thrombin exerts a contrary and protective effect by activation of the Rho pathway; how cross-talk between these two pathways occurs still remains to be established. The balance of cross-talk may be determined at least in part by the order of activation of RhoA and the activation of PKA in vivo. If RhoA is activated first, it may be more refractory to inactivation by phosphorylation, as in the case of blocking the cAMP effect by thrombin in SH-EP cells, because GTP-γ-S/RhoA is not as good a PKA substratein vitro as GDP/RhoA. If RhoA is phosphorylated in its GDP-form by PKA, it may be locked in the inactive state even if it can be converted to the GTP-form unless dephosphorylation takes place. Furthermore, PKA could also directly inhibit GTP exchange of RhoA in lymphoid cells (40). However, depending on the cell type, the balance of effects promoted by the two pathways can still be very different. In SH-EP cells, the thrombin-activated pathway dominates the cAMP-activated pathway at least in terms of its ability to maintain cell morphology. In contrast, increasing cAMP levels can protect against neurite retraction induced by LPA in neuronal-like PC12 cells (38Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebok A. Marshall F. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). During the course of this study, Lang et al. (28Lang P. Resbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) demonstrated that recombinant RhoA is phosphorylated in vitro by PKA at Ser-188 and that this phosphorylation of RhoA increases its interaction with guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor even in its GTP-bound state. They suggested that the translocation of phosphorylated GTP-Rho from membrane to cytosol by its binding to guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor terminates RhoA signaling by preventing its interaction with downstream effectors, independently from its cycling from GTP to GDP. Using a phosphorylation-resistant RhoA mutant RhoAV14A188 and a nonresistant RhoA mutant RhoAV14, we have explored the biological consequences of RhoA phosphorylation in vivo. Our data show that the phosphorylation-resistant RhoA mutant is more potent than the nonresistant RhoA mutant in protecting SH-EP cells from forskolin-induced cell shape changes (Fig. 5). The activity of phosphorylation-resistant RhoA mutant to promote stress fiber formation is unaffected by forskolin at concentrations that effectively blocked this activity of the nonresistant RhoA mutant in SK-N-SH cells (Fig.6). Phosphorylation also impairs the binding of GTP-RhoA to its effector ROKα in vitro. Based on these observations, it is possible that PKA phosphorylation of RhoA may not only result in membrane removal and cytosolic sequestration of the GTP-Rho by guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor as suggested by Lang et al. (28Lang P. Resbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) but also reduces its interaction with ROKα. Both effects would result in a decreased translocation of ROK to membrane sites where it exerts its activity (6Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 13Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The activation of Rho is a very rapid event with formation of the GTP-bound being accomplished within seconds of cellular exposure to factors (39Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The multiple means of achieving inhibition of Rho outlined above and also by p190GAP (32Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1955-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) infer that inhibition of this primary GTPase may be an important requirement for cytoskeletal reorganization to occur. Indeed growth cone development and neurite extension can occur in neuroblastomas and PC12 cells merely by inhibiting Rho (5Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 24Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J.

The SH-EP cells with their differential response to agents affecting morphology reported here provide an amenable vehicle for studying the morphological consequences of Rho activation and inactivation, and how cross-talk between Rho and PKA morphological pathway is achieved."
https://openalex.org/W1979228758,"Mutation in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae APG14 gene causes a defect in autophagy. Cloning and structural analysis of the APG14 gene revealed that APG14 encodes a novel hydrophilic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 40.5 kDa, and that Apg14p has a coiled-coil motif at its N terminus region. We found that overproduction of Apg14p partially reversed the defect in autophagy induced by theapg6-1 mutation. The apg6-1 mutant was found to be defective not only in autophagy but also in sorting of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a vacuolar-soluble hydrolase, to the vacuole. However, overexpression of APG14 did not alter the CPY sorting defect of the apg6-1 mutant, nor did theapg14 null mutation affect the CPY sorting pathway. Structural analysis of APG6 revealed that APG6is identical to VPS30, which is involved in a retrieval step of the CPY receptor, Vps10p, to the late-Golgi from the endosome (Seaman, M. N. J., Marcusson, E. G., Cereghino, J. L., and Emr, S. D. (1997) J. Cell Biol. 137, 79–92). Subcellular fractionation indicated that Apg14p and Apg6p peripherally associated with a membrane structure(s). Apg14p was co-immunoprecipitated with Apg6p, suggesting that they form a stable protein complex. These results imply that Apg6/Vps30p has two distinct functions in the autophagic process and the vacuolar protein sorting pathway.

Cell growth is governed by a fine-tuned balance between the synthesis and degradation of proteins. In mammalian cells, both lysosomal and nonlysosomal protein degradation mechanisms are responsible for turnover of endogenous proteins. Intracellular proteolytic activity is essential for cells to survive in various extracellular environments. Autophagy is the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components in the lysosome/vacuole (1Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1923-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 2Dunn Jr., W.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Under serum starvation conditions, animal cells induce autophagy to supply amino acids (5Mortimore G.E. Schworer C.M. Nature. 1977; 270: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Autophagy starts with formation of the autophagosome, a cytoplasmic membrane structure surrounding cytosolic components or organelles. The outer membrane of the autophagosome subsequently fuses with the lysosomal membrane, and the contents are degraded in a lysosomal proteinase-dependent manner (6Seglen P.O. Glamann H. Ericsson J.L. Marzella L. Lysosomes. Academic Press, London1987: 371-414Google Scholar). Although mammalian autophagy has been characterized with morphological and biochemical approaches, the molecular basis of each process is still unclear. Recent studies revealed that autophagy takes place in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in a similar manner to that of higher eucaryotes (7Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 8Baba M. Osumi M. Ohsumi Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Several lines of investigation showed that yeast autophagy is composed of the processes as follows: (i) starvation signaling, (ii) formation of autophagosome, (iii) targeting of autophagosome to the vacuole, (iv) fusion of the outer membrane of the autophagosome to the vacuolar membrane and release of the autophagic body in the vacuole, and (v) degradation of the autophagic body in the vacuole (4Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 7Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J.

To elucidate the complex phenomena at a molecular level, autophagy-defective mutants (apg mutants) were isolated, and at least 14 APG genes were shown to be essential for yeast autophagy (10Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). The phenotypic similarities among the 14 apg mutants suggest that the Apg proteins are involved in close processes in the autophagic pathway. Previous morphological studies showed that none of the apg mutants could form autophagosomes, 1M. Baba, unpublished data.suggesting the APG products function at autophagosome formation or at earlier steps of autophagic processes. So far, most of the APG genes have been cloned and characterization of the Apg proteins is underway (11Kametaka S. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 178: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Funakoshi T. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 192: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). However, their functions in the autophagic pathway remain to be elucidated. In this study, we report the structural and functional analyses of Apg14p and Apg6p. APG6 were identical to VPS30, which is involved in the vacuolar protein sorting pathway (14Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 15Seaman M.N. Marcusson E.G. Cereghino J.L. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that Apg6/Vps30p has two distinct functions, both on autophagy and vacuolar protein sorting pathways, and that Apg14p is specifically required for the function of Apg6/Vps30p in autophagy. Yeast strains used (Table I) were derived from X2180-1A and X2180-1B (Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Berkeley, CA). The media used for yeast were described previously (11Kametaka S. Matsuura A. Wada Y.

Protein concentration of the cell lysate was examined with Bradford's method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Standard molecular biological techniques for the manipulation of DNA were used throughout this study (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast strain MT54-4-2 was transformed with a yeast genomic library based on YCp50. Approximately 3,200 Ura+ transformants were replica-plated to 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate and 2% glucose (SD(−N)) plates including 5 μg/ml phloxine B and incubated for 48–72 h at 30 °C. Seven white colonies were picked up and subsequently examined for their autophagic activity by a morphological assay as described previously (4Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 10Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Four autophagy-positive (Apg+) clones were obtained, and the genomic fragments were isolated from them. Partial sequencing analysis showed that the 9-kb genomic fragment obtained was identical to a region on chromosome II, and the 2.0-kbEcoRI-ClaI fragment containing a sole open reading frame YBR128c was found to complement the apg14-1mutation. The DNA region was introduced into pRS306 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and subsequently integrated at the APG14 locus (data not shown), confirming that it contains the authentic APG14 gene. Plasmid pYAPG1411 containing the 1.6-kbEcoT22I-ClaI fragment in pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) was digested with EcoRV, and ligated with the 2.0-kb SalI fragment from pJJ283 (21Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid pYAPG14DL1 was digested with BamHI and HindIII and introduced into a diploid strain YNY1, and Leu+transformants were obtained. Correct integration of theapg14::LEU2 fragment into the chromosomalAPG14 locus was verified by Southern hybridization (data not shown). One Leu+ transformant was selected and sporulated; then tetrads were dissected and germinated on YEPD plates. Cloning of the APG6 gene was performed as described above except that we used a yeast genomic library based on the YEp13 vector plasmid. After integration mapping and subcloning, we obtained the 3.8-kb PvuII fragment that contains the APG6gene. For nucleotide sequencing, the PvuII fragment was inserted into pBluescript II SK+ at the SmaI site; then nested deletion series were constructed by treatment with exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease (22Henikoff S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2961-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The single strand DNA was isolated by infecting helper phage M13KO7 and used for templates for DNA sequencing. To make the APG6 deletion mutant, the 3.8-kbPvuII fragment was cloned into pBluescript II SK+ at thePvuII site, and the 1.1-kb EcoRI-XhoI region was replaced with the 2.0-kb SalI fragment from pJJ283. The resultant plasmid pYAPG6DL1 was digested withPvuII and the apg6::LEU2 fragment was used for disruption of the chromosomal APG6 locus. The apg6-1mutant allele was recovered as described previously (23Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In brief, genomic DNA was prepared from mutant strain MT9-4-4 as described elsewhere (16Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar), and the mutant allele was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-AAGGATCCTGAAGTGCCAAACATGT-3′ and 5′-AAGGATCCTTTCCGCTGATGGTCTTA-3′ with Ex-Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Japan). The apg6 disruptant cells were co-transformed with both the amplified DNA fragment of 1.6 kb and pYAPG650 (CEN APG6) predigested atSpeI, which is the sole site in the APG6 open reading frame. Obtained transformants were examined for Apg phenotype by checking for the accumulation of ABs 2The abbreviations used are: ABautophagic bodykbkilobase pair(s)PMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideCPYcarboxypeptidase YGADPHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseAPIaminopeptidase I.

The 1.4-kbEcoRI-HindIII fragment of APG6 was subcloned into pUR292 to generate a plasmid pLAC-APG6EH. The β-galactosidase-Apg6p fusion protein was expressed inEscherichia coli JM109 and purified with electroelution from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The purified β-galactosidase-Apg6p fusion protein was used for preparation of polyclonal antibody in a rabbit. Immunization was carried out at Shibayagi Co. (Maebashi, Japan). Total yeast lysate was prepared by mixing cells with glass beads as described previously (25Nakamura N. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11344-11349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analyses were performed as described previously (24Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y.

Vacuolar sorting of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) was analyzed by the method previously reported (15Seaman M.N. Marcusson E.G. Cereghino J.L. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of CPY and alcohol dehydrogenase in the cellular and medium fractions and fluorography were done as described previously (26Wada Y. Kitamoto K. Kanbe T. Tanaka K. Anraku Y. Mol.

For cell lysis, spheroplasts were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 500 × gfor 3 min, the cleared cell lysate (total lysate) was subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to generate a low speed pellet and low speed supernatant, then the low speed supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to generate a high speed pellet and high speed supernatant. Each fraction was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting was carried out as described above. For the differential solubilization experiment, cell lysates were prepared as described above and treated with buffer, 1 mNaCl, 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.0), 2 m urea, and 2% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Immunoprecipitation of Apg6p was performed essentially as described elsewhere (28Kamada Y. Qadota H. Python C.P. Anraku Y. Ohya Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9193-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) with slight modification. In brief, yeast cells were collected, washed with distilled water containing 10 mm NaN3, then converted to spheroplasts and lysed osmotically in IP-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM; Boehringer Mannheim). After removal of cell debris and glass beads by centrifugation at 500 × gfor 3 min twice, the protein concentration was determined. The sample was adjusted to a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml with ice-cold IP-lysis buffer. To the sample 0.1 volume of 10% Nonidet P-40 and 0.05 volume of protein A-Sepharose 4B (50% slurry, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and preabsorption was performed at 4 °C for 1 h. To remove the protein A-Sepharose, the sample was microcentrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 s, and the supernatant was recovered. Then the first antibody was added (3.5 μl of anti-Apg6p antiserum per 1 mg of lysate was used for immunoprecipitation of Apg6p) to the preabsorbed lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 12 h. Forty μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry) were added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h to recover the IgG and washed with IP-lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 four times, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were obtained by boiling the protein A-Sepharose with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer for 5 min. To obtain DNA regions ofVPS35 and VPS29, the gene fragments were amplified from genomic DNA with 5′-TTCACCGCAGAATACTTTT-3′ (35-F), 5′-TGGTAGGCCAACCATTAT-3′ (35-R), and 5′-CAGATTTCTGTAGTTGAGG-3′ (29-F), 5′-ATTGACCTTAGATGGGAC-3′ (29-R) primer pairs, respectively. For disruption of VPS35, the 3.0-kb EcoRV fragment was subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene), then the 0.5-kb SpeI-BglII region was replaced with aURA3 fragment. To obtain a disruptant of VPS29, the 1.2-kb SpeI-PstI genomic fragment was subcloned to pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene), then the 0.4-kbXbaI-StyI region was replaced with aLEU2 fragment. The resultantΔvps35::URA3 andΔvps29::LEU2 fragments were introduced into wild-type (YW5-1B) cells to disrupt the genomic VPS genes. Disruption of the genomic locus was confirmed with a genomic polymerase chain reaction. Previously we had isolated the apg14 mutant which is defective in autophagy (10Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). When wild-type cells were incubated in a nitrogen-depleted medium containing PMSF, the final membrane structure of autophagy, ABs, are accumulated in the vacuole (Fig.1 A). However, theapg14-1 mutant shows no ABs accumulating in the vacuole, indicating that the mutation causes a defect in autophagy. Moreover, the mutant showed loss of viability under nitrogen starvation. Over 95% of the mutant cells died during incubation under nitrogen starvation for 10 days, whereas approximately 75% of wild-type cells were still alive (Fig. 1 B). To characterize the APG14 gene product, the gene was cloned by complementation of the defect in maintenance of viability under starvation as described previously (see “Experimental Procedures”) (11Kametaka S. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1996; 178: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Sequencing of APG14 showed that it encodes a hydrophilic protein of 334 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 40.5 kDa (Fig. 2 A). The N-terminal regions between amino acid residues 25–60 and 91–122 of Apg14p contain heptad repeats that are predicted to adopt α-helical coiled-coil conformation (Fig. 2 B) (29Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). Data base searches revealed that Apg14p is a novel protein exhibiting no significant similarity to other protein sequences at present. To determine the phenotypic consequences of a complete loss of Apg14p function, a null mutant allele of apg14 was generated by replacing the central two-thirds region of APG14 with aLEU2 gene cassette (Fig.3 A) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The null mutant SKD14DP was viable and showed normal growth on YEPD medium, indicating APG14 function is not required for vegetative growth of the cell (data not shown). Then, autophagic activity of the null mutant was determined with morphological and biochemical assays. As shown in Fig. 3 B, SKD14DP was defective in accumulation of ABs in the vacuole under nitrogen starvation conditions and was also defective in autophagy-dependent alkaline phosphatase processing (Fig.3 C) (24Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These results indicate that APG14 is essential for autophagy. To identify the gene product of APG14, an epitope-tagged version of Apg14p was constructed by introducing the c-Myc 11 amino acids epitope (EQKLISEEDLN). Six repeats of Myc were inserted into the N terminus of Apg14p to obtain a significant signal for characterization of Apg14p. A deduced molecular mass of the Myc-tagged Apg14p was 49.4 kDa (Fig. 4 A). A plasmid pYAPG316-6m14 (CEN 6 × Myc-APG14) complemented the defect in autophagy of the apg14disruptant, indicating the Myc-tagged Apg14p was functional in vivo (data not shown). Using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (30Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) which recognizes the Myc epitope sequences, a 52-kDa protein was detected in yeast whole cell extract by immunoblot analysis. The Myc-Apg14p was found to be expressed constitutively in growing cells and the amount of the product did not change during nitrogen-starvation (Fig. 4 A). The intracellular localization of Myc-Apg14p was investigated by subcellular fractionation experiments. We found that most of Myc-Apg14p was detected in precipitable fractions, mainly in the low speed pellet fraction (Fig. 4 B). To examine the nature of the association in the precipitable fractions, differential solubilization experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 4 C, Myc-Apg14p was solubilized completely with alkali-treatment, and partially with urea or Triton X-100 treatment. This suggests that Myc-Apg14p associates with a membrane fraction and the association must be peripheral, because Apg14p does not have apparent transmembrane domains or sites for lipid modification. The quite similar phenotypes exhibited by theapg mutants suggested that some of the Apg proteins act together in the autophagic processes. Moreover, Myc-Apg14p was found to peripherally associate with a membrane, suggesting there are other components which act with Apg14p. To test this, we looked for genetic interaction between APG14 and other APG genes. We found that apg6-1 cells carrying pKTm14, a multiple copy plasmid harboring APG14 downstream of the GAPDH promoter, accumulated ABs in the vacuole (Fig.5 A). The result indicates that the autophagic defect of the apg6-1 mutant was suppressed with APG14 overexpression, whereas the apg14-1mutation was not suppressed with APG6 overexpression (data not shown). For characterization of the APG6 gene, cloning of authenticAPG6 was carried out (see “Experimental Procedures”). APG6 encodes a protein with expected molecular mass of 63.3 kDa and has a heptad repeat of leucine residues. The central portion of Apg6p is strongly predicted to form coiled-coil structures (29Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). No other remarkable features including hydrophobic cluster for transmembrane region, signal sequences, or sites for post-translational modifications were found. To determine the mutation site of theapg6-1 allele, the mutant allele was cloned from mutant genomic DNA and sequencing was carried out (see “Experimental Procedures”). Structural analysis of the apg6-1 mutant allele revealed that a single nucleotide substitution (C to T) at base position +805 caused a nonsense mutation at glutamine residue 269 in the apg6-1 mutant (Fig.6 A, asterisk). Next, to analyze the physiological roles of APG6, the genomic APG6 locus was disrupted as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 6 B). The disruptant strain SKD6-1D was viable, indicating that Apg6p function is not essential for vegetative growth in yeast. Δapg6 cells showed a defect in autophagy (Fig. 6 C) and loss of viability under nitrogen starvation conditions similar to the APG14disruptant (data not shown). To analyze the effects of the mutants on autophagic expression, SKY6DP (apg6-1) and SKD6DP (Δapg6) were transformed with pKTm14. Autophagic activity of the apg6-1 mutant was rescued approximately 35% by overexpression of APG14. However, the suppression was not observed in the apg6disruptant (Fig. 5 B). Immunoblot analysis showed that theapg6-1 mutant gene product was stably expressed as a protein of 35 kDa (data not shown). These results suggest that the existence of the truncated form of Apg6p is necessary for reversal of autophagy by Apg14p overproduction. Furthermore, overproduction of the mutant Apg6p from the apg6-1 allele weakly complemented the autophagic defect of the apg6 disruptant (data not shown), suggesting the N-terminal half of the protein contains an essential function for Apg6p. To detect theAPG6 gene product, we generated a polyclonal antibody against Apg6p (see “Experimental Procedures”). The antibody recognized a 65-kDa protein in the total lysate of wild-type cells. Since the protein was not detected in the apg6 deletion mutant, we concluded that this 65-kDa protein is the APG6gene product. Subcellular localization of Apg6p was determined by subcellular fractionation (see “Experimental Procedures”). As a result, Apg6p was fractionated in precipitable fractions and was detected mainly in the 10,000 × g pelletable fraction (Fig. 7 B, LSP). As shown in Fig. 7 C, Apg6p was solubilized by treatment with the reagents indicated. Treatment with 1 m NaCl, 0.1m Na2CO3, or Triton X-100 effectively solubilized Apg6p. This suggests that Apg6p peripherally associates with some membrane structure(s). Theapg14 and apg6 mutants have similar phenotypes, and overproduction of Apg14p suppresses the autophagic defect of theapg6-1 mutant (Fig. 5). Furthermore, Apg14p and Apg6p appear to be associated with membrane fractions (Figs. 4 and 7). These results strongly suggest that Apg14p and Apg6p physically interact and act together through autophagic processes. To address this possibility, immunoprecipitation of Apg6p was carried out from SKD14-1C cells expressing Myc-Apg14p. Spheroplasts were gently lysed and the extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Apg6p antiserum. The immunoprecipitants were used for immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 8, Myc-Apg14p was precipitated with anti-Apg6p antiserum. This co-immunoprecipitation is dependent upon anti-Apg6p antiserum (Fig. 8) and Apg6p (Fig. 8). To know whether the interaction between Apg14p and Apg6p is mediated by membrane structures, the cell lysate was preincubated with 1% Triton X-100 before immunoprecipitation. We found that Myc-Apg14p was also co-immunoprecipitated with Apg6p when the cell extract had been pretreated with detergent, suggesting that Apg6p and Apg14p directly interact. Moreover, this interaction was observed in both vegetatively growing and starved cells. Structural analysis of APG6 revealed that it is identical to the VPS30 gene. Recently, theVPS30 gene, which is involved in sorting the vacuolar soluble proteinase, CPY, was cloned and characterized (15Seaman M.N. Marcusson E.G. Cereghino J.L. Emr S.D. J.

The expression of HPV-16 late genes encoding the virus capsid proteins L1 and L2 is restricted to terminally differentiated epithelial cells in the superficial layers of the squamous epithelium. We have previously identified negative elements in the 3′ end of L2 RNA that act in cis to reduce mRNA utilization without substantially affecting mRNA levels. The experiments reported here demonstrate the interaction of cellular proteins with an inhibitory sequence present in the coding region of the L2 mRNA. Using RNA gel shift assays and UV cross-linking, we have detected three cellular proteins interacting specifically with the sense strand of the L2 mRNA, two of which were identified as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) and the poly(rC) binding- protein (PCBP). Recombinant hnRNP K, PCBP-1, and PCBP-2 that were over expressed in bacteria and partially purified bound to the HPV-16 L2 mRNA in a sequence-specific manner. Interestingly, PCBP-1, PCBP-2, and hnRNP K specifically and efficiently inhibited translation of the HPV-16 L2 mRNA in vitro. Therefore, these proteins may play an important role in the regulation of HPV-16 late gene expression and virus production in vivo.

At present more than 70 different types of HPVs have been identified that can be divided into mucosal or cutaneous types on the basis of the epithelium they infect (2Billakanti S.R. Calef C.E.

The major stimulus for current interest in the HPV group originates from the discovery of the casual relationship to carcinoma of the cervix of certain HPV types, primarily types 16 and 18 (3zur Hausen H.

Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 2077-2109Google Scholar). The genomic organization of the various HPV types is very similar. All of the open reading frames are located on one strand of viral genomic DNA that consists of an early, a late, and a noncoding region (1Howley P.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. 2. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 2045-2076Google Scholar).

The late genes code for the major and minor capsid proteins, L1 and L2, respectively, and their expression is thought to be regulated at both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional level.

The inhibitory RNA sequences on the late papillomavirus mRNAs are probably important determinants of virus late gene expression levels, presumably as a result of interactions with cellular RNA binding factors (16Dietrich-Goetz W.

Expression of HPV-16 L2 from subgenomic expression plasmids is very inefficient and we were unable to detect L2 protein after transfection of eucaryotic expression plasmids designed to produce L2 in mammalian cells (14Sokolowski M. Tan W. Jellne M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1504-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same vectors express high levels of various cellular and viral genes that we have tested previously. Due to this we speculated that the L2 coding region itself may contain sequences that repress L2 production. In an attempt to verify this idea, we found that sequences in the 5′ end of the L2 coding region were responsible for the relatively short half-life of the L2 mRNAs, whereas sequences in the 3′ end of L2 reduce protein levels approximately 10-fold without substantially affecting mRNA levels when inserted after a reporter gene (14Sokolowski M. Tan W. Jellne M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1504-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have identified cellular proteins that interact specifically with the 3′ end of the L2 coding region encompassing the inhibitory RNA sequences. These proteins were hnRNP K and PCBP-1 and -2. Translation of the L2 open reading frame in vitro was specifically inhibited by the presence of these proteins, suggesting that L2 production is regulated by binding of these factors to the L2 mRNA in the infected differentiating epithelial cells. Plasmid pKSH was constructed by first a polymerase chain reaction amplifying HPV-16 L2 sequences from nucleotide position 4860–5665 (numbers refer to nucleotide positions in the HPV-16 genomic clone) (23Seedorf K. Krämer G. Dürst M. Suhai S. Röwekamp W.G. Virology. 1985; 145: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides L2B (5′-CACGCGTCAGTAACTAGTAGCACACCCA-3′) and L2STOP (5′-CAGTCGACCGTGGCCTCACTAGGCAGCC-3′) followed by subcloning into theEcoRV site in pBluescript KS− (Stratagene). To generate pKSHΔABC, two NcoI sites were first introduced into the L2 sequence in pKSH by site-specific mutagenesis as described previously (24Luukkonen B.G.M. Tan W. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4086-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sites were located at nucleotide positions 5056 and 5431 (numbers refer to nucleotide positions in the HPV-16 genomic clone) (23Seedorf K. Krämer G. Dürst M. Suhai S. Röwekamp W.G. Virology. 1985; 145: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The mutant plasmid was digested with NcoI and religated, resulting in pKSHΔABC. Polylinker sequences between the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and the L2 insert were deleted by digesting the plasmids with Asp718 and MluI, filling in of over hangs, and religating to generate pKSHΔABCpl. In order to generate plasmid pKSΔABCpl718, pKSHΔABCpl was digested withAsp718 and NcoI, which resulted in a plasmid containing the last 228 nucleotides of HPV-16 L2. pT7PCBP-1 was generated by transferring an EcoRI-BamHI fragment encoding PCBP-1 from a GST-PCBP-1 plasmid (22Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Celis J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) to pBluescript. The pT7CAT plasmid was produced by inserting aSalI-Asp718 CAT fragment from pNLCATB (13Tan W. Felber B.K. Zolotukhin A.S. Pavlakis G.N. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5607-5620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into pBluescript. pT7CAT-L2 was generated by subcloning into pT7CAT of HPV-16 L2 sequences polymerase chain reaction amplified with oligonucleotides L2B and L2STOP. pT7lacZ was constructed by cloning into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) of the lacZ open reading frame polymerase chain reaction amplified from pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using oligonucleotides LACZ-S (5′- CACTTCACATGAGCGAAAAATAC-3′) and LACZ-A (5′- GGTTATTATTATTTTTGACAC-3′). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts used in all experiments were prepared from subconfluent HeLa cells according to the procedure described by Dignam et al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). PCBP-1, PCBP-2, hnRNP K, and GST were expressed from pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)-derived constructs (22Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Celis J.E. Eur. J.

In vitro transcription reactions were performed essentially as described previously (17Zhao C. Tan W. Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3659-3667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting RNA probes are displayed in Fig. 1 A. RNA mobility shift assays, RNaseT1 protection assay, UV cross-linking, and immunoprecipitation of UV cross-linked proteins were performed as described previously (17Zhao C. Tan W. Sokolowski M.

In vitro translation of presynthesized capped mRNA was performed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) or in the transcription/translation-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions in the absence or presence of recombinant GST fusion protein. HeLa cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 (28Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar), producing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, and transfected with 5 μg of pT7L2, pT7CAT, pT7CAT-L2, or pT7lacZ in the absence or presence of pT7PCBP-1, as described previously (13Tan W. Felber B.K. Zolotukhin A.S. Pavlakis G.N. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5607-5620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, The amount of pT7PCBP-1 used is indicated in the figure legends. The total amount of DNA in transfection mixes was adjusted to 15 μg per 0.5 ml of precipitate per 60-mm plate by using pUC18 carrier DNA. Each transfection experiment was performed at least four times. Production of CAT protein was quantitated by a CAT antigen capture ELISA (Boehringer GmbH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (13Tan W. Felber B.K. Zolotukhin A.S. Pavlakis G.N. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5607-5620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-PCBP-2 serum (29Blyn L.B. Towner J.S. Semler B.L. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6243-6246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was generously provided by E.

Virol. 1991; 65: 6862-6871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (provided by J. Dillner) was used at a 1:1000 dilution, as described elsewhere (13Tan W. Felber B.K. Zolotukhin A.S. Pavlakis G.N.

Expression of HPV-16 late genes L1 and L2 is restricted to terminally differentiated cells in squamous epithelium (1Howley P.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. 2.

Papillomavirus Reviews: Current Research on Papillomaviruses. Leeds University Press, 1996: 85-92Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the HPV-16 L2 mRNA coding region contains sequences that inhibit expression of L2 in nonterminally differentiated cells (14Sokolowski M. Tan W. Jellne M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1504-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′ end of L2 containscis-acting sequences that inhibit protein production without substantially affecting mRNA levels (14Sokolowski M. Tan W. Jellne M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1504-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether cellular factors interact with the 3′ end of the L2 mRNA, a series of RNA gel shift and UV cross-linking assays were performed, and the results are displayed in Fig. 1. The L2 RNA probes are depicted in Fig. 1 A. As can be seen in Fig.1 B, L2 RNA H1 forms RNA-protein complexes when incubated with nuclear extract derived from a HeLa cell line. Complex formation was inhibited by an excess of cold L2 RNA but not by tRNA (Fig.1 B). Complex formation was less efficient using cytoplasmic extract, presumably because the cytoplasmic extract contains fewer L2 RNA-binding proteins (data not shown and see below). Since the results established the specific interaction of cellular proteins with the L2 inhibitory RNA sequence, it was of interest to perform UV cross-linking assays in order to visualize the individual RNA-binding proteins. Several proteins were found binding to the L2 RNA; however, only three cellular proteins A, B, and C with molecular masses of 66, 41, and 35 kDa, respectively, were shown to interact with sequence specificity since they bind to the sense L2 RNA strand and not to the antisense RNA, as shown in Fig. 1 C (for protein A, see also Fig.1 D). Proteins A and C were found primarily in the nuclear fraction, while protein B was found primarily in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1 C). UV cross-linking in the presence of 90 mm KCl instead of 120 mm resulted in more efficient detection of protein A (Fig. 1 D). Analysis of L2 deletion mutants (Fig. 1 A) revealed that proteins A and B interact with the 3′ end of the L2 RNA probe while protein C interacts with the 5′ end of the RNA probe (Fig. 1, C andE). A longer exposure of the gel was required to detect protein C (data not shown). Because proteins A, B, and C interact specifically with L2 RNA, they became of interest, and further investigation was encouraged since it was possible they may play functional roles in the regulation of HPV-16 late gene expression. Since we had established that proteins bound to L2 RNA specifically it was of interest to characterize them in aid of their future identification. We first wished to establish whether the proteins interacting with the L2 RNA had affinities for specific homoribonucleotides. Competition experiments were therefore performed with poly(rA), poly(rC), poly(rU), and poly(rG), preincubated with cell extracts followed by the addition of radiolabeled L2 RNA and UV cross-linking. The results presented in Fig.2 A show the avid binding affinity of protein B for poly(rC) and also the binding affinity of protein C for poly(rU). Optimization of conditions for detection of protein A revealed that it had affinity for poly(rC) and that binding to L2 RNA was unaffected by poly(rA) and poly(rG) (Fig. 2 B). Since many RNA-binding proteins have been characterized as having binding affinity for ssDNA (20Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 21Ross J. Micobiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 15-95Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine the relative affinities of proteins A, B, and C for various ssDNAs. Two oligonucleotides with different pyrimidine content were selected. Oligo 1 with a pyrimidine content of 52% competed efficiently for proteins A and B (Fig. 2 C, lane 1), whereas oligo 2 with a pyrimidine content of 40% failed to compete with the L2 RNA (Fig.2 C, lane 2), indicating that proteins A and B have affinity for pyrimidine-rich ssDNA. To further characterize the L2 RNA-binding proteins, UV cross-linking experiments were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of KCl (90 or 500 mm) and MgCl2 (3 or 8 mm), and the results are shown in Fig. 2 D. As can be seen, the binding of proteins A and C is not detectable with increasing concentrations of KCl (Fig. 2 D, lane 3), while in the presence of increasing concentrations of MgCl2, binding affinity is shown to increase slightly in both cases (Fig. 2 D, lane 4). Protein B also displays an increase in binding affinity with increasing concentrations of MgCl2 but also interestingly displays a significant level of binding affinity in the presence of 500 mm KCl (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3 and 4). A protein of 55 kDa was also observed binding to the L2 RNA in the presence of 500 mm KCl and 8 mm MgCl2 (Fig.2 D), but this protein was not observed to interact specifically since it appeared to bind also to the antisense L2 RNA strand. However, it may be of interest because it appears to have strong affinity for the L2 RNA. In retrospect of the results obtained, we postulated the identities of proteins A and B as being hnRNP K and PCBP-2, respectively. hnRNP K is a 67-kDa, nuclear RNA-binding protein with shuttling function and affinity for poly(rC) and ssDNA (20Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), while PCBP-2 is a 41-kDa cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that also binds poly(rC) and ssDNA (22Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Celis J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We received a monoclonal antibody to hnRNP K (20Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) and a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against PCBP-2 (29Blyn L.B. Towner J.S. Semler B.L. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6243-6246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which were used in a series of RNA gel shift assays and immunoprecipitation assays. As can be seen in Fig.3 A, L2 mRNA UV cross-linked in the presence of nuclear and cytoplasmic extract and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antiserum to PCBP-2 (29Blyn L.B. Towner J.S. Semler B.L. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6243-6246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) caused the formation of a doublet band at the expected molecular mass of 41 kDa. Normal rabbit serum did not precipitate UV cross-linked proteins (Fig. 3 A). It is conclusive from this result that not only is PCBP-2 found interacting with the L2 RNA but that it interacts to a greater extent in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3 A), reinforcing that it is predominantly active in the cytoplasm. A possible explanation for the precipitation of two proteins with the same serum may be that one is an isoform of PCBP-2 or perhaps it is PCBP-1, a closely related protein, since they both have similar properties and the serum toward PCBP-2 also reacts with PCBP-1 (31Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA. 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar). This result was reinforced as two proteins were detected in the cytoplasmic extract of HeLa cells in a Western blot using the same serum (Fig. 3 B). The appearance of two bands in the UV cross-linking immunoprecipitation assay could then be interpreted as the interaction of two related proteins with the L2 RNA. To investigate whether the nuclear protein termed A interacting with the L2 RNA could be hnRNP K, nuclear extract was preincubated with hnRNP K monoclonal antibody (20Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) prior to analysis of the extract in RNA gels shift assay. This procedure was used since we were unable to immunoprecipitate hnRNP K with this monoclonal antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 4, the incubation of L2 RNA with nuclear extract causes an RNA-protein complex to form, and if the monoclonal antibody against hnRNP K (20Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) is preincubated with nuclear extract, inhibition of complex formation is observed (Fig. 3 C, lane 2). An unrelated monoclonal antibody to HPV-16 L1 protein has no effect on complex formation (Fig. 3 C, lane 1) and thus establishes the specificity of the hnRNP K antibody. Therefore, the conclusion drawn from this experiment is that the monoclonal antibody against hnRNP K prevents interactions between hnRNP K and the L2 RNA. To verify the results obtained by immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays, GST fusion proteins of hnRNP K, PCBP-1, and PCBP-2 were synthesized in a bacterial expression system and were partially purified. It was due to the similar properties of PCBP-1 and PCBP-2 and the fact that two UV cross-linked proteins were immunoprecipitated with the PCBP-2 antiserum that we decided to investigate whether PCBP-1 also interacted with L2 RNA. The results presented in Fig. 3 D (lanes 2 and 4) show the specific interaction of both PCBP-1 and PCBP-2 to L2 sense RNA and show that these proteins have very slight binding affinity to the L2 antisense RNA (Fig. 3 D, lanes 3 and5). The binding to the antisense L2 RNA presumably occurs because the recombinant proteins are present in higher concentrations than those in the HeLa cell extracts. Fig. 3 D, lanes 6 and 7, show the positive interaction of GST-hnRNP K to L2 mRNA; once again it is clear that hnRNP K displays a higher affinity toward L2 sense mRNA than to the L2 antisense mRNA. Purified GST did not UV cross-link to L2 RNA (Fig. 3 D,lane 1). As described above for the cytoplasmic proteins A and B, PCBP-1, PCBP-2, and hnRNP K interacted primarily with the 3′ end of the L2 RNA sequence (Fig. 3 E and data not shown). RNA gel shift assays revealed that cold RNA H5 competed efficiently with the probe for binding of the proteins, whereas cold RNA H3 did not (Fig.3 F), further demonstrating the specificity of the interactions. Taken together, these results confirmed our previous results that both PCBP-2 and hnRNP K do indeed interact in a sequence specific manner with the L2 mRNA. We also extended these results to include the binding of PCBP-1 to the HPV-16 L2 mRNA. We have previously shown that the insertion of the complete HPV-16 L1 or L2 coding regions downstream of the CAT gene resulted in 50–200-fold inhibition of CAT production (13Tan W. Felber B.K. Zolotukhin A.S. Pavlakis G.N. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5607-5620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sokolowski M. Tan W. Jellne M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1504-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schwartz S. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 1-11Crossref Google Scholar). The complete L1 and L2 coding sequences from HPV-1-inhibited CAT production 3–10-fold (14Sokolowski M. Tan W. Jellne M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1504-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The negative element mapped to the 3′ end of the HPV-16 L2 coding sequence inhibited gene expression 12–13-fold (14Sokolowski M. Tan W. Jellne M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1504-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the negative element in the 3′ end of HPV-16 L1 inhibited gene expression 33-fold (13Tan W. Felber B.K. Zolotukhin A.S. Pavlakis G.N. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5607-5620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the corresponding region from HPV-1-inhibited gene expression less than 2-fold in transfected cells. These results suggested that the poly(C)-binding proteins detected with the HPV-16 L2 RNA probe used here may bind strongly also to HPV-16 L1 while they may interact with lower affinity with the HPV-1 L2 sequence that contains weak inhibitory sequences. To test this idea, the last 337 nucleotides of the HPV-16 L1 open reading frame and the last 532 nucleotides of the HPV-1 L2 open reading frame were used as competitors in an RNA gel shift assay with the HPV-16 L2 RNA probe H2 and PCBP-1. The results revealed that HPV-16 L1 RNA competed efficiently with the HPV-16 L2 probe, suggesting that PCBP-1 also may affect HPV-16 L1 production (Fig. 3 G). In contrast, the HPV-1 L2 RNA did not compete efficiently with the HPV-16 L2 RNA probe (Fig. 3 G). The results obtained with serially diluted competitors were quantitated and are shown in Fig.3 H. In conclusion, the inhibitory activity of the various HPV sequences in cells correlates with their affinities for the poly(C)-binding proteins. Since we had established that PCBP-1, PCBP-2, and hnRNP K were binding specifically to the L2 mRNA, it was obvious to examine the functional role of the proteins. A combination of these proteins has recently been shown to inhibit in vitro translation of the erythroid 15-lipoxygenase RNA (36Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Therefore, we observed the effect of PCBP-1, PCBP-2, and hnRNP K on the translation of the full-capped L2 mRNA and on the capped CAT reporter mRNA, used here as an internal control. The experiment was performed in duplicate using two different systems, the coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and the uncoupled system programmed with presynthesized L2 and CAT-capped RNA. As all three proteins are produced in HeLa cells (20Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 31Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA. 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar), we first investigated if a mix of the three proteins affected in vitro translation of HPV-16 L2. As shown in Fig.4 A, a mixture of PCBP-1, PCBP-2, and hnRNP K (lane 2) combined inhibits translation of the L2 mRNA. A 3-fold serial dilution of the GST fusion proteins (lanes 3 and 4) shows an alleviation of translational inhibition. No translational inhibition is observed on the internal control CAT mRNA (Fig. 4 A). Results using the coupled system are shown to the left in Fig.4 A, and the results from the uncoupled to theright. Quantitation of the protein levels by densitometry revealed that addition of the three proteins reduced the translation of L2 mRNA 3.5- and 4.7-fold, respectively, in the two translation systems (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2). The mean fold inhibition value of L2 in the absence or presence of PCBP-1, PCBP-2, and hnRNP K in three independent experiments was 3.9-fold. The CAT protein levels were quantified with densitometry and in CAT ELISA. The CAT protein acting as the internal control displays no significant fold difference when PCBP-1, PCBP-2, and hnRNP K are present or absent (Fig.4, A and B), indicating specific translational inhibition toward L2 mRNA and not CAT mRNA. Interestingly, each protein alone inhibited L2 translation to a similar extent as the mixture of the three proteins (Fig. 5,A and B), while CAT was unaffected (Fig. 5,A and B). The presence of the L2 sequence downstream of the CAT gene, as in pT7CAT-L2, inhibited CAT production in the presence of PCBP-1 (data not shown), suggesting that the L2 sequence acts as a landing pad for the inhibitory proteins, while in a parallel experiment, translation of CAT from pT7CAT-derived mRNAs was unaffected by PCBP-1.Figure 5A, in vitro translation of HPV-16 L2 and CAT mRNA in the absence (lane 1) or presence of 1 μg of PCBP-1 (lane 2), 1 μg of PCBP-2 (lane 3), or a mix of PCBP-1, PCBP-2, and hnRNP K GST fusion proteins (lane 4). The L2 protein levels were quantitated in a PhosphorImager and arbitrary units are shown. The CAT protein levels are unaffected by the fusion proteins. B, in vitro translation of HPV-16 L2 and CAT mRNA in the absence (lane 1) or presence of 1 or 0.33 μg of hnRNP K GST fusion protein (lanes 2 and 3, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether the PCBP proteins inhibit production of HPV-16 L2 also in intact cells, we used the vaccinia virus T7 expression system (28Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar), which allows production of detectable levels of HPV-16 L2 despite the presence of inhibitory sequences (14Sokolowski M. Tan W. Jellne M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1504-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably a result of the high expression levels in this system. The HPV-16 L2 expression plasmid pT7L2 and the CAT plasmid pT7CAT were transfected into vaccinia virus vTF7-3 (28Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar)-infected HeLa cells in the absence or presence of the serially diluted PCBP-1 expression plasmid pT7PCBP-1. Each transfection experiment was performed at least four times. Production of L2 was assayed by immunoblotting, the L2 levels were quantitated by densitometry, and the CAT levels were quantitated in a CAT capture ELISA. The results show that PCBP-1 inhibits production of HPV-16 L2 also in intact human epithelial cells (Fig.6 A), while the levels of CAT produced from the internal control plasmid pT7CAT are unaffected by PCBP-1 overexpression (Fig. 6 B). One of the quantitated L2 immunoblots is shown in Fig. 6 C. Cotransfection of pT7L2 and pT7CAT with various amounts of the pT7 vector, the empty vector lacking PCBP-1 coding sequences, did not affect production of HPV-16 L2 (Fig.6 C). We conclude that PCBP-1 inhibits L2 production also in human cells. In addition, transfection of cells with pT7CAT-L2, a plasmid that contains L2 sequences downstream of CAT, in the presence of increasing concentrations of pT7PCBP-1 resulted in a gradual decrease in CAT levels (Fig. 7 A), further indicating that the presence of the L2 sequence on the mRNA inhibits expression of a heterologous mRNA. The β-galactosidase levels produced from the pT7lacZ internal control plasmid were unaffected by PCBP-1 overexpression (Fig. 7 B). As a further control, we cotransfected pT7CAT-L2 and pT7lacZ with various amounts of the pT7 vector, the empty vector that lacked PCBP-1 coding sequences. Cotransfection with pT7 vector did not affect CAT production from pT7CAT-L2 (Fig. 7 C) or β-galactosidase from pT7lacZ (Fig.7 D). In conclusion, overexpression of PCBP-1 in HeLa cells specifically inhibited protein production from mRNAs containing HPV-16 L2 sequences. From HeLa extracts, three proteins were observed to interact specifically with the L2 sense RNA strand. A 35-kDa poly(rU)-binding, nuclear protein and two poly(rC)-binding proteins were identified as PCBP-2 and hnRNP K. Although positive identification of the 35-kDa protein was not achieved, a number of proteins with similar properties have been described (21Ross J. Micobiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 15-95Google Scholar). For example, the ubiquitously expressed elav-like protein HuR, which is present at high levels in HeLa cells (32Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 33Myer V.E. Xinhao C.F. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2130-2139Google Scholar), is a 36-kDa nuclear protein that binds avidly to U-rich sequences (32Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 33Myer V.E. Xinhao C.F. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2130-2139Google Scholar) and binds to the 3′-untranslated regions of c-Fos, c-Myc, N-Myc, and the interleukin-3 mRNAs (32Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Purification of the 35-kDa protein identified here is required to determine its relation to known poly(U)-binding proteins. The interaction of hnRNP K, PCBP-1, and PCBP-2 with the L2 mRNA is an interesting finding since they are the main poly(rC)-binding proteins in HeLa cells (20Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 22Leffers H. Dejgaard K. Celis J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 31Gamarnik A.V. Andino R. RNA. 1997; 3: 882-892PubMed Google Scholar), but the L2 sequence does not possess a high content of cytosine, in fact it contains only 22% cytosines and only three sites in the L2 sequence contain four or more cytosine repeats. Despite this fact, the PCBPs and hnRNP K proteins display a high affinity for the L2 mRNA. This point is enforced by the observation that these proteins are not observed interacting with the antisense strand of the L2 sequence. However, the overall pyrimidine content of L2 at 53% is higher than in the average mRNA which may be one explanation for the affinity of the PCBPs and hnRNP K for the L2 sequence. Alternatively, the L2 sequence may contain optimal binding sites for PCBP and hnRNP K proteins, perhaps due to RNA secondary structure. Interaction between RNA-binding proteins and mRNA is achieved through RNA binding domains present in the proteins. It is conceivable that the interaction between hnRNP K and the L2 inhibitory element is facilitated by the presence of three copies of a motif termed the KH domain as well as two RGG boxes (34Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The structural similarity between PCBP-2 and PCBP-1 led us to believe that PCBP-1 could also interact with L2, and in vitro experiments performed verified this prediction. The PCBP-1 and -2 do not contain RGG boxes but contain three KH domains each (34Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is most likely that the KH domains of both PCBP-1 and -2 and hnRNP K are responsible for the interaction with the L2 mRNA. This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that KH domains have been shown to bind poly(rC) (35Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and that poly(rC) competes with L2 RNA for binding to these proteins. To analyze a functional role for these RNA-binding proteins, one must associate their binding with the progressive life cycle of the papillomavirus, which is strictly linked to the differentiation of stratified epithelium (5Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Intervirology. 1994; 37: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6Laimins L.A. Infect. Agents Dis. 1993; 2: 74-86PubMed Google Scholar, 7Meyers C. Laimins L.A. Lacey C. Papillomavirus Reviews: Current Research on Papillomaviruses. Leeds University Press, 1996: 79-83Google Scholar, 8Stanley M.A. Antivir. Res. 1994; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Hagensee M.E. Galloway D.A. Lacey C. Papillomavirus Reviews: Current Research on Papillomaviruses. Leeds University Press, 1996: 85-92Google Scholar). The ability of hnRNP K and PCBP-1 and -2 to inhibit translation of the L2 mRNA appears to suggest a mechanism of decreasing the levels of L2 protein in the lower layers of the epithelium upon infection of the virus. It is therefore suggestible that HPV utilizes not only host factors to selectively repress its viral capsid production but also the level of differentiation present in the epithelium. In a stratified epithelium, L2 protein is only present from the granular layer to the stratum corneum, while the mRNA can be found in lower layers. This would suggest that, through the interaction of hnRNP K and PCBP-1 and -2 with L2 mRNA coupled with environmental changes experienced in the epithelium as differentiation occurs, L2 mRNA is inefficiently translated, but upon progression to epithelium differentiation, translational inhibition is alleviated. Growing evidence now suggests that the controls determining the functional integrity of cytoplasmic mRNAs may be susceptible to the level of differentiation of the cell. It has been shown previously that hnRNP K and PCBP-1 inhibit the in vitro translation of 15-lipoxygenase mRNA (36Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The levels of 15-lipoxygenase mRNA are high in immature red blood cells, but 15-lipoxygenase protein is undetectable. In the course of differentiation, the translational repression is released. The silencing of translation is seen to be conferred by a differentiation control element in the 3′-untranslated region and through the binding of hnRNP K and PCBP-1 to this region. The mechanism used by these proteins involves the specific inhibition of 80 S ribosome assembly on 15-lipoxygenase mRNA and control of cap-dependent and internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation by binding to differentiation control elements (36Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The fact that the inhibitory L2 sequence is active, when located downstream of the translated open reading frame, suggests that translation initiation is affected as in 15-lipoxygenase mRNA. It is possible that hnRNP K and PCBP-1 and -2 regulate translation of cellular and virus mRNAs in response to fluctuating differentiation signals in different cell types. We thank H. Leffers, E.

https://openalex.org/W2060007614,"The Na+/I−symporter (NIS), a 618-amino acid membrane glycoprotein that catalyzes the active accumulation of I− into thyroid cells, was identified and characterized at the molecular level in our laboratory (Dai, G., Levy, O., and Carrasco, N. (1996) Nature 379, 458–460). Because mature NIS is highly glycosylated, it migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad polypeptide of higher molecular mass (∼90–110 kDa) than nonglycosylated NIS (∼50 kDa). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we substituted both separately and simultaneously the asparagine residues in all three putativeN-linked glycosylation consensus sequences of NIS with glutamine and assessed the effects of the mutations on function and stability of NIS in COS cells. All mutants were active and displayed 50–90% of wild-type NIS activity, including the completely nonglycosylated triple mutant. This demonstrates that to a considerable extent, function and stability of NIS are preserved in the partial or even total absence of N-linked glycosylation. We also found that Asn225 is glycosylated, thus proving that the hydrophilic loop that contains this amino acid residue faces the extracellular milieu rather than the cytosol as previously suggested. We demonstrated that the NH2 terminus faces extracellularly as well. A new secondary structure model consistent with these findings is proposed.

The uptake of I− into thyroid cells, an essential step in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones T3 and T4, is mediated by the Na+/I−symporter (NIS) (2Carrasco N. Biochim. Biophys.

The Na+ gradient acting as the driving force for I− accumulation is maintained by the Na+/K+ ATPase (2Carrasco N. Biochim. Biophys.

A thorough electrophysiological analysis of NIS activity was carried out in X. laevisoocytes injected with NIS cRNA, recording both pre-steady and steady state currents (6Eskandari S. Loo D.D.F.

The obtained electrophysiological and kinetic data are consistent with a mechanistic model in which Na+binding is followed by I− binding in an ordered fashion. Simultaneous recordings of ion fluxes and currents revealed a stoichiometry of 2 Na+/I− (6Eskandari S. Loo D.D.F. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.W. Carrasco N. J. Biol.

A secondary structure model was proposed on the basis of hydropathy analysis and secondary structure algorithms (1Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N.

Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 343-367Google Scholar). NIS was predicted to traverse the membrane 12 times and to have both the NH2 and COOH termini on the intracellular face of the membrane. A recently generated antibody against the COOH terminus of NIS recognizes a broad ∼87-kDa polypeptide, as visualized by immunoblot analysis of membrane proteins from FRTL-5 cells (a highly active line of rat thyroid-derived cells) (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with anti-NIS Ab in FRTL-5 cells confirmed the cytosolic location of the NIS COOH terminus (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have shown in rats that NIS protein expression is up-regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone in vivo. NIS up-regulation was observed in rats with increased thyroid-stimulating hormone circulating levels resulting either from 6-propyl-2-thiouracil treatment or from an I−-deficient diet (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Conversely, NIS protein expression was decreased in hypophysectomized rats, which exhibit markedly lower thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. For the first time, mutations in NIS have recently been identified as causative of cases of congenital hypothyroidism (8Fujiwara H. Tatsumi K. Miki K. Harada T. Miyai K. Takai S. Amino N. Nat. Genet. 1997; : 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Matsuda A. Kosugi S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Pohlenz J.

We have demonstrated by in vitro peptidylN-glycosidase F digestion that NIS is highly glycosylated in membranes from FRTL-5 cells, as well as in NIS-expressing X. laevis oocytes and COS cells. Complete N-glycosidase F digestion of mature ∼87-kDa NIS results in a deglycosylated ∼50-kDa NIS species (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Paire et al. (12Paire A. Bernier-Valentin F. Selmi-Ruby S. Rousset B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18245-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have recently confirmed that mature NIS is a highly glycosylated protein in FRTL-5 cells. Two putative N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn485and Asn497) are present in the last predicted extracellular loop of NIS, and a third site (Asn225), is located within the predicted third intracellular loop (1Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). In the present report we used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute, both separately and simultaneously, the asparagine residues in all three putativeN-linked glycosylation consensus sequences of NIS with glutamine and assessed the effects of the mutations on function and stability of NIS in COS cells expressing mutant NIS, as compared with wild-type NIS. In addition to demonstrating that N-linked glycosylation is not essential for activity or stability of NIS, the results also show that Asn225 is glycosylated, thus proving that the mentioned hydrophilic loop that contains Asn225 is on the extracellular face of the membrane. A new secondary structure model consistent with this finding is proposed. The following individual mutagenic oligonucleotides were generated to substitute each asparagine residue in the NIS N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences to glutamine: N225Q, CTCGCTCAGCAACATTCCCGG; N485Q, GGCTGCACCCAAGATTCGGTC; and N497Q, GGAGCCACCCAAGCTTCCAAC. The initial polymerase chain reaction extensions were performed using reverse primers complementary to the 3′ end. These fragments were gel purified and used for a second round polymerase chain reaction extension with complementary primers from the 5′ end. Fragments with the mutant sequences were obtained by digesting the final polymerase chain reaction products with the appropriate unique restriction enzymes that would yield the smallest mutant fragments. These fragments were ligated into wild-type NIS cDNA and the mutant inserts were sequenced past their respective cloning sites. The double and triple mutants were obtained by combining individual mutants using the appropriate endogenous restriction sites. The Flag epitope mutant was obtained by constructing an oligo: GGAATTCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAAATGGAGGGTGCGGAGGCCGG. This oligo contains, at its 5′ end, a unique restriction site (EcoRI) followed by a start codon, the nucleotides corresponding to the eight-amino acid Flag sequence (DYKDDDDK), and the first 20 bases of the 5′ end of the NIS coding region. A single polymerase chain reaction extension was performed with a reverse primer complimentary to NIS. This fragment was digested withEcoRI/BlpI and ligated into the same sites in pSV.Sport and wild-type NIS, respectively. COS cells were cultured and transfected in 10-cm dishes; 1 day after transfection cells were seeded onto six-well dishes where iodide transport activity was measured exactly as reported (1Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). SDS-9% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotting to nitrocellulose were performed as described previously (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). All samples were diluted 1:2 with loading buffer and heated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to electrophoresis. Immunoblot analyses were also carried out as described (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both incubations were performed for 1 h. Polypeptides were visualized by ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Membranes from COS cells were prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors as described (13Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Membranes (40 μg) were resuspended in 10 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 18.8 μl of water was added either with 3 μl of N-glycosidase F (600 milliunits, Boehringer Mannheim) or 1.2 μl of 50% glycerol. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 37 °C (18 h). 1.5 μl of 2% of lithium dodecyl sulfate was added wheneverN-glycosidase F treatment was carried out in the presence of detergent. After overnight incubation, the reaction was diluted 1:2 with loading buffer (15 μl), and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to electrophoresis (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed as described (7Levy O. Dai G.

Forin vivo labeling, COS cells were cultured and transfected in 10-cm dishes and seeded 24 h after transfection onto 6-cm dishes. COS cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine 48 h after transfection followed by immunoprecipitation at the indicated time points with 1:50 dilution of anti-NIS serum (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). According to our previously proposed NIS secondary structure model there are two putative N-linked glycosylation sites located in the last extracellular loop at Asn485 and Asn497 (see Fig. 5 A) (1Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Asn485 and Asn497 were individually substituted with glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis, thus giving rise to single NIS mutants N485Q and N497Q. COS cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type, N485Q or N497Q NIS cDNA, and were studied 2 days after transfection to analyze NIS expression (Fig.1 A) and activity (see below, Fig. 2). On immunoblots of membranes from transfected COS cells, wild-type NIS appeared both as a partially glycosylated ∼59-kDa and a mature glycosylated ∼108-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). N485Q and N497Q each gave rise to partially glycosylated 55-kDa and mature ∼92–95-kDa polypeptides (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 3, respectively), indicating that each mutant NIS polypeptide was subjected to partial N-linked glycosylation. Thereafter, both Asn485 and Asn497 were simultaneously substituted with glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis, generating the N485Q/N497Q double mutant. This also yielded a partially glycosylated ∼52-kDa polypeptide and, unexpectedly, a mature ∼72-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), demonstrating that at least one additional N-linked glycosylation site was still functional.Figure 1Immunoblot analysis of NISN-linked glycosylation mutants.

WT-NIS, wild-type NIS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although NIS contains another putative N-linked glycosylation site at position 225 (see Fig. 5 A), this site lies within the predicted third intracellular loop. Because onlyN-linked consensus sequences located within extracellularly facing protein domains are exposed to N-linked glycosylation enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen during biosynthesis,N-linked glycosylation sites in intracellular domains are not glycosylated. Hence, to investigate whether Asn225 was glycosylated, notwithstanding its predicted intracellular location, Asn225 was similarly replaced with glutamine, and the resulting N225Q NIS mutant was assessed for expression and activity. Like single mutants N485Q and N497Q, single mutant N225Q yielded a partially glycosylated ∼53-kDa and a mature ∼82-kDa NIS polypeptide (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). The similarity in electrophoretic mobility between N225Q and the other two single mutants suggests that Asn225 is glycosylated. Moreover, these data show that N-linked glycosylation of NIS is not dramatically impeded when a single glycosylation site is removed by mutation, given that under these circumstances two other N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences remain available. Thus, the triple mutant N225Q/N485Q/N497Q was generated and assessed as described above, appearing on immunoblots as a single ∼50-kDa NIS polypeptide (Fig.1 A, lane 6) that comigrated with wild-type NIS expressed in Escherichia coli, where N-linked glycosylation is absent (Fig. 1 A, lane 7) (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This result demonstrates that Asn225 is a functionalN-linked glycosylation site and that the Asn225-containing hydrophilic loop is therefore located on the extracellular side of the membrane (see secondary structure model of NIS below). To confirm that the mature mutant NIS polypeptides observed in the immunoblots are indeed glycosylated, membranes from COS cells expressing either wild-type or mutant NIS were treated with N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that cleaves the bond between asparagine andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine, thus releasingN-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 1 B). Deglycosylation of NIS was carried out at a low concentration (0.1%) of lithium dodecyl sulfate to prevent aggregation of NIS, allowing the molecule to unfold completely and have all sites accessible to the enzyme (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of single and double mutants yielded ∼50-kDa polypeptides (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2,4, 6, 8, 10, and12), which comigrated with both the triple mutant and NIS expressed in E. coli (Fig. 1B, lane 13). Therefore, the observed differences in apparent molecular masses between partially glycosylated mutant NIS polypeptides and the presumed mature forms were because of N-linked glycosylation. Although the predicted molecular mass of NIS is 65.2 kDa, the unglycosylated polypeptide clearly migrated faster (∼50 kDa) than its predicted molecular mass, an electrophoretic behavior observed in many other hydrophobic polytopic membrane proteins (14Newman M.J.

To examine the effect of the described mutations on NIS function, iodide transport assays were carried out in COS cells expressing wild-type and mutant NIS 2 days after transfection. Remarkably, all mutants exhibited perchlorate-sensitive NIS activity, at values ranging from 50 to 90% of the activity displayed by wild-type NIS (Fig. 2). Thus, all mutations had only a marginal modulatory effect on NIS activity. The single most significant aspect of these results is that all mutants were active, indicating that to a considerable extent function and targeting of NIS are preserved in the partial or even total absence ofN-linked glycosylation. Triple mutant NIS, which is completely nonglycosylated, exhibited ∼50% of wild-type NIS activity. This mutant is unquestionably of considerable value for further structure/function study of NIS (see “Discussion”). To ascertain whether the lack of N-linked glycosylation has an effect on the stability of NIS, COS cells transfected with triple mutant or wild-type NIS were labeled in vivo with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min and subjected to chase periods of up to 56 h in the presence of unlabeled methionine and cysteine. Solubilized [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-NIS Ab and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Wild-type NIS first appeared in the autoradiogram as a ∼56-kDa precursor molecule that was then processed into the mature ∼90–100-kDa polypeptide, remaining detectable for 39 h (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–3 and 5–8). When membranes from COS cells expressing wild-type NIS were treated with N-glycosidase F after a 30-min chase, NIS appeared as a ∼52-kDa polypeptide in the corresponding autoradiogram (lane 4). This indicates that the ∼56-kDa precursor is itself already partially glycosylated and that the ∼52-kDa polypeptide species resulting fromN-glycosidase F treatment corresponds to fully nonglycosylated NIS. Whereas triple mutant NIS differed markedly from wild-type NIS in that it appeared only as a ∼52-kDa polypeptide that was never processed, triple mutant NIS nevertheless also remained detectable for 39 h, thus proving to be nearly as stable as wild-type NIS (Fig. 3 A, lanes 9–12; the quantitation of lanes 5–12 is depicted in Fig.3 B). Therefore, it is clear that N-linked glycosylation is not an essential requirement for NIS stability. Although the above data indicate that N-linked glycosylation is not essential for NIS function, it is of interest to determine whether the decrease in activity resulting from abolishedN-linked glycosylation was because of a change in NIS affinity for iodide (Km) or in the number of functional NIS molecules present in the membrane (apparentVmax). To examine this issue, a kinetic analysis of the triple mutant was carried out. The effect of varying concentrations of I− (ranging from 2.5 to 160 μm) on NIS activity was studied in COS cells expressing either triple mutant or wild-type NIS (Fig. 3 C). I− uptake reached saturation at ∼40 μm of I− in COS cells expressing either wild-type or triple mutant NIS. The double reciprocal plot of the same data is presented in Fig. 3 D. The calculated Km for I− was virtually identical in wild-type and triple mutant NIS (∼41 ± 1.78 and 36 ± 1.32 μm, respectively) in four independent experiments. In contrast, the calculated Vmax values were 210 ± 3.98 pmol I−/μg DNA/4 min for wild-type NIS and 70 ± 2.72 pmol I−/μg DNA/4 min for triple mutant NIS. Thus, the absence of N-linked glycosylation resulted in a ∼3-fold decrease in the Vmax without altering the Km for I−. These results demonstrate that the reduction in I− uptake catalyzed by the triple mutant is because of either a decreased number of active NIS molecules in the plasma membrane or NIS molecules with a higher turnover number than wild-type NIS rather than to a lower affinity of triple mutant NIS for I−. In light of the data presented in Fig. 1, it is clear that Asn225 faces extracellularly and that our originally proposed secondary structure model of NIS should be revised. According to this original model, NIS was predicted to traverse the membrane 12 times and to have both the NH2 and COOH termini on the intracellular face of the membrane (1Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). We have previously shown conclusively, using a site-directed polyclonal Ab against the COOH domain of NIS, that the COOH terminus of NIS faces intracellularly (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, our attempts to raise an anti-NH2 terminus Ab have not been successful. Thus, to test directly whether the NH2 terminus of NIS is located intracellularly or extracellularly, we used site-directed mutagenesis to engineer a NIS construct bearing a Flag epitope (sequence MDYKDDDDK) at the NH2 terminus (N-Flag NIS), so that this domain could be detected with anti-Flag Ab. I− uptake in COS cells expressing N-Flag NIS was indistinguishable from wild-type NIS, indicating that the presence of the Flag sequence does not impair the activity of NIS (Fig.4 A). N-Flag NIS was clearly monitored with anti-Flag Ab by immunoblot analysis of membranes from COS cells expressing N-Flag NIS (Fig. 4 B). Most tellingly, immunofluorescence analysis with anti-Flag Ab of COS cells expressing N-Flag NIS revealed immunofluorescence in both nonpermeabilized and permeabilized cells, demonstrating that the NH2 terminus faces extracellularly (Fig. 4 C, panel d). By contrast, immunofluorescence in these cells was present only in permeabilized cells when anti-NIS COOH terminus Ab was used (Fig.4 C, panels a and b), a finding consistent with the known intracellular location of the COOH terminus, as reported previously in FRTL-5 cells (7Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Specificity of the immunoreactivity of the anti-Flag Ab was verified by the ability of the N-Flag peptide to competitively prevent immunofluorescence in these cells when added together with anti-Flag Ab (Fig. 4 C,panels e and f). In conclusion, a revision of the NIS secondary structure model should depict both the domain containing Asn225 and the NH2 terminus facing extracellularly. When the predicted amino acid sequence of NIS was compared with those of other cloned Na+-dependent cotransporters, the highest degree of homology (24.6% amino acid identity) was found to exist with the human Na+/glucose cotransporter, SGLT1 (1Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 3Dai G. Levy O. Amzel L.M. Carrasco N. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. II. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 343-367Google Scholar). Both the sequence and hydropathy profile comparisons suggest that the membrane topology of NIS is similar to that of SGLT1. As we reported previously in connection with both NIS and SGLT1 (3Dai G. Levy O. Amzel L.M. Carrasco N. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. II. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 343-367Google Scholar), the amino acid sequence, hydropathy analysis, and secondary structure algorithms for both of these proteins are actually compatible with three different topological models. In the case of NIS, two of these models propose 12 helices, and one proposes 13 helices. Given the absence of a signal sequence in NIS, we had considered the 13-helix model less likely than the others because it predicts for the NH2 and COOH termini to be on opposite sides of the membrane (i.e. on the extracellular and intracellular sides, respectively) (3Dai G. Levy O. Amzel L.M. Carrasco N. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. II. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 343-367Google Scholar). In light of the evidence presented here on the glycosylation of Asn225 (Fig. 1) and the extracellular location of the NH2 terminus (Fig. 4), we now propose that NIS most likely contains 13 transmembrane helices (Fig.5 B). We predict that the highly hydrophobic region comprising amino acid residues 389–410 located between the previously proposed helices 9 and 10 forms a new transmembrane helix (Fig. 5 A, dotted line). As a result of this change, helices 1–9 all have reversed polarity with respect to the original model, so that both the NH2terminus and the hydrophilic loop containing Asn225 are now placed on the extracellular side (Fig. 5 B). It is remarkable that current evidence supports precisely the 13-helix model that we initially regarded as less likely. It must be emphasized that the original model was favored on the basis of widely held expectations on the secondary structure of membrane transporters, such as the assumed link between the absence of a signal sequence and the placement of the NH2 terminus on the cytosolic side of the membrane. Not only does the present study prove that such a link is not always required, but it also leads to the conclusion that currently employed guidelines for assigning the polarity of transmembrane domains in this class of proteins are probably less reliable than is generally believed. The 13-transmembrane domain model we propose here for NIS is consistent with recent findings reported on SGLT1 using N-linked glycosylation scanning mutagenesis (17Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although SGLT1 was also originally predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains, a new 14-transmembrane domain model has been proposed (17Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this model the first 13 domains of SGLT1 coincide with those we are presently predicting for NIS, with helix 14 corresponding to a highly hydrophobic carboxyl tail, which is not present in NIS. The 14-transmembrane domain SGLT1 model places the NH2 terminus on the extracellular face of the membrane. Our data are consistent with the topological information recently reviewed for the SGLT1 family of transporters (19Turk E. Wright E.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Like NIS, such other transporters as SGLT1 and the GABA transporter have been found to be active in the absence of N-linked glycosylation. Whereas addition of tunicamycin (an inhibitor of the synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides) to HeLa cells expressing GABA transporter abolishes GABA uptake (20Keynan S. Suh Y.J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), significant GABA uptake activity is detected in HeLa cells expressing nonglycosylated GABA transporter. Similarly, nonglycosylated SGLT1 is fully functional (17Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), even though the activity of SGLT1 is inhibited by tunicamycin (21Wu J.-S.R. Lever J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1192: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our results are at variance with a conclusion reached in a report stating that N-linked glycosylation is essential for NIS folding and stability (12Paire A. Bernier-Valentin F. Selmi-Ruby S. Rousset B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18245-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Paire et al. (12Paire A. Bernier-Valentin F. Selmi-Ruby S. Rousset B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18245-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) observed that tunicamycin prevented both the synthesis of mature NIS and the thyroid-stimulating hormone-dependent reinduction of NIS activity in FRTL-5 cells and hence reported thatN-linked glycosylation is essential for NIS synthesis, folding, and stability (12Paire A. Bernier-Valentin F. Selmi-Ruby S. Rousset B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18245-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because tunicamycin inhibits the synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides and thus preventsN-linked glycosylation of all proteins in the cell, it is clear that the observed effect of tunicamycin on NIS activity is not necessarily due specifically to the lack of N-linked glycosylation of NIS. The results presented here show rather that function and stability of NIS are considerably preserved in the partial or even total absence of N-linked glycosylation. Fully nonglycosylated triple mutant NIS is highly active, and both its affinity for iodide and its half-life are similar to those of wild-type NIS. Even though the topology of eukaryotic Na+-driven symporters has recently received considerable attention (17Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Olivares L. Aragon C. Gimenez C. Zafra F. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), relatively few proposed secondary models for these proteins have been unequivocally confirmed experimentally. N-linked glycosylation scanning mutagenesis has proved to be a valuable technique to analyze the topology of SGLT1, GABA (GAT-1), glycine (GLYT1), and glutamate/aspartate (GLAST-1) transporters, albeit with some limitations (Refs. 11Pohlenz J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, respectively). This technique is most effective when applied to the study of transporters that are functional even when devoid of carbohydrate moieties. As shown above, we have found that NIS is functional in a deglycosylated state, and therefore it is amenable to a topology analysis byN-linked glycosylation scanning mutagenesis to further probe our present secondary structure model. In the absence of tridimensional structure data, it is crucial to determine the topology of polytopic membrane proteins to design studies aimed at the elucidation of helix packing and understanding the roles played by specific protein domains and individual amino acid residues in the function of these proteins. The current secondary structure model will continue to be experimentally tested by a variety of biochemical, biophysical, and immunological methods with the ultimate goal of elucidating the molecular mechanism of I− transport into thyroid cells.

Varlamov for help with the immunofluorescence experiments."

Open table in a new tab HEK-293 cells and HEK-293/C-21 cells stably expressing hPTH1-Rc (∼400,000 receptors/cell) were cultured in D-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described (25Pines M.

HEK293/C-21 cells were subcultured in polylysine-coated 24-well plates and grown to confluence. Radioreceptor assays were carried out as described previously (23Nakamoto C. Behar V. Chin K. Adams A.E. Suva L.J. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10546-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HEK293/C-21 cells were subcultured in 24-well plates and grown to near confluence. COS-7 cells transiently expressing mutant receptors were subcultured 24 h following transfection at a density of 2 × 105/well in 24-well plates and assayed for adenylyl cyclase activity 72 h after transfection. Activation of adenylyl cyclase by PTH analogs was determined as described (23Nakamoto C. Behar V. Chin K. Adams A.E. Suva L.J. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10546-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The stimulation of increases in intracellular calcium levels following treatment by PTH-(1–34) and the Bpa-containing analogs was assessed spectroscopically in Fura-2-loaded HEK-293/C-21 cells as described (26Behar V. Pines M. Nakamoto C. Greenberg Z. Bisello A. Stueckle S.M. Bessalle R. Usdin T.B. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2748-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity cross-linking of125I-[Bpa1,Nle8,18,Arg13,26,27,l-2-Nal23,Tyr34]bPTH-(1–34)NH2was carried out as described (17Zhou A.T. Bessalle R. Bisello A. Nakamoto C. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Chorev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent HEK-293/C-21 cells were harvested with 0.5 mm EDTA, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in D-MEM at a density of ∼60 × 106 cells/ml. This suspension was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of 0.3 mCi (∼0.5 nmol) of 125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) after which cells were placed on ice in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) at a distance of ∼10 cm from six 15-watt 365 nm UV lamps and irradiated for 1 h. Cells were then washed five times with PBS, resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and lysed by five cycles of freezing and thawing. Membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. Membranes were solubilized in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing Triton X-100 (2% v/v) at room temperature for 2 h. Proteins were precipitated by adding five volumes of cold acetone and redissolved in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing SDS (2% w/v). Proteins were reduced with 100 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 37 °C and alkylated with 200 mmiodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature. The solution was desalted and concentrated on Centricon 50 (Amicon), diluted with reducing Laemmli sample buffer, and loaded on a 7.5% (v/v) SDS-PAGE. After autoradiography, the radioactive125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34)–Rc conjugate was excised from the gel, passively eluted in 100 mmNH4HCO3/SDS (0.01% v/v), pH 7.5, and submitted to concentration and buffer exchange on Centricon 50 (Amicon) to 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing Triton X-100 (0.1% v/v) and SDS (0.01% v/v). Small scale photoaffinity cross-linking of transiently transfected COS-7 cells, grown to overconfluence, was carried out in 24-well tissue culture plates. Cells were washed with D-MEM and were treated with 200 μl of D-MEM and either 25 μl of 10−5m PTH-(1–34) in vehicle (PBS, 0.1% BSA), or vehicle alone. Reactions were incubated 15 min at room temperature, 1–2 × 106 cpm of125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) (total volume 25 μl) added to each well, and incubated an additional 15 min at room temperature. Plates were cross-linked in a Stratalinker for 30 min as described earlier. Each well was washed once with PBS, cells lysed with 0.5 ml of Laemmli sample buffer, shaken in dish for 10–30 min, and harvested into Eppendorf tubes. Tubes were incubated on a rotating platform at room temperature for 2–3 h, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Batches of SDS-PAGE-purified radiolabeled hormone-receptor conjugate and fragments were prepared in small volumes (typically 10–20 μl) of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, Triton X-100 (0.1% v/v), SDS (0.01% w/v). Endo-F digestions were carried out at 37 °C for 24 h, according to the manufacturer's procedure. Lys-C digestions were performed by two 24-h treatments with 0.15 units (in 10 μl of water) at 37 °C. BNPS-skatole digestions were carried out with 2 mg/ml BNPS-skatole in 70% acetic acid at 37 °C for 24–48 h in the dark. CNBr digestions were performed with 50 mg/ml CNBr in 70% formic acid at 37 °C for 24 h in the dark. Samples were dried on Speed-Vac and dissolved in reducing sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) prior to electrophoresis. Electrophoretic analyses were performed with 7.5% SDS-PAGE for the hormone-receptor conjugates and 16.5% Tricine/SDS-PAGE for the cleavage products. Appropriate molecular weght markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Bio-Rad) were included in each gel. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.) with intensifying screens (XAR-5, Eastman Kodak Co.). Following autoradiography, the radioactive fragments were excised from the dried gels, extracted in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.5, SDS (0.01% w/v) and concentrated on Speed-Vac. Single mutations, M414L and M425L, were introduced into the hPTH1-Rc cDNA generating two mutated hPTH1[M414L] and hPTH1[M425L] Rcs, respectively. Primer pairs (sense and antisense) were prepared containing these amino acid modifications (Life Technologies, Inc. custom primers): sense M414L (5′ to 3′): CCACGCTGGTGCTCCTGCCCCTCTTTGGCGTC; sense M425L (5′ to 3′): CACTACATTGTCTTCCTGCCACACCATACACC. Primer pairs were used in the polymerase chain reaction-based Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using the hPTH1-Rc (28Adams A.E. Pines M. Nakamoto C. Behar V. Yang Q.M. Bessalle R. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10553-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in the pZeoSV2 (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector as a template. Individual polymerase chain reaction reactions were used to transform DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transformations were plated on bacteriologic agar containing Zeocin, colonies identified and selected for plasmid isolation (Miniprep Kit, Quiagen). Plasmid preparations were cycle sequenced (Genomyx, Foster City, CA) to confirm the fidelity of the mutations, using oligonucleotide primers located 5′ to the regions of the hPTH1-Rc targeted for mutation. The entire mutant Rc was subsequently completely sequenced, on both strands, to ensure the single Met → Leu mutation. COS-7 cells were plated at 5–7.5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish 24 h prior to transient transfections. Ten μg of either mutant or native receptor construct were co-transfected with 10 μg carrier DNA using calcium/phosphate (Life Technologies, Inc.). For adenylyl cyclase assay and photoaffinity cross-linking, transiently transfected cells were subcultured as described above. The molecular model of the hPTH1-Rc was developed using the topological arrangement of the TM helices of rhodopsin (29Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). To identify the location of the TM portions of the hPTH1-Rc, assumed to be α-helices, a hydrophobicity profile (30Eisenberg D. Weiss R.M. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) was calculated for the hPTH1-Rc sequence. Each of the initially identified transmembrane domains, expanded by approximately 15 amino acids on each side, was submitted to a BLAST search (31Altshul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The results helped to refine the location of the TM helices; there was good agreement with respect to the location of the helices from these two methods. After placing the identified helices of the hPTH1-Rc onto the rhodopsin template, the helices were rotated about their long axis to orient the hydrophobic moment toward the membrane environment. These orientations were then refined, requiring minor adjustments, following the substitution-table methodology reported by Donelly and co-workers (32Donnelly D. Overington J.P. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The loops connecting the TM helices were added to complete the model. In an attempt to develop the conformational preferences of the ectopic N-terminal portion of the receptor, the corresponding sequences were submitted to a BLAST search (31Altshul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). There were numerous sequences of significantly high homology in the protein data bank, especially for a region of the ectopic N-terminal tail of the hPTH1-Rc contiguous to the TM1 helix. The homologous regions of each of these protein structures were analyzed for secondary structural features and then incorporated into the molecular model. To refine the molecular model, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and energy minimization were carried out with the CVFF91 force field within the Discover program (Biosym/MSI). To mimic the environment of the membrane, a two-phase simulation cell consisting of H2O and CCl4 was utilized. The explicit solvent simulations were carried out following previously published procedures (33Pellegrini M. Mierke D.F. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All molecular modeling was carried out with the Insight II program (Biosym/MSI). Binding affinities for the hPTH1-Rc stably expressed in HEK-293 cells (clone C-21) were measured by competition with125I-[Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH-(1–34)NH2(125I-PTH-(1–34)) (Fig.1 A). Agonist activity (stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and increase in intracellular calcium levels) was determined in HEK-293/C-21 cells (25Pines M. Adams A.E. Stueckle S. Bessalle R. Rashti-Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, Band C). The substitution of Ala1 with Bpa in PTH-(1–34) generated Bpa1-PTH-(1–34), which displays a pharmacological profile similar to that of the parent peptide PTH-(1–34) (IC50 ∼4.5 nm; EC50∼2 nm and [Ca2+]i = 130 nm at 10−7m ligand and IC50 ∼25 nm, EC50 ∼0.8 nm and [Ca2+]i = 100 nmat 10−7m ligand for PTH-(1–34) and Bpa1-PTH-(1–34), respectively). Bpa substitution of Val2 caused a 17-fold reduction in binding affinity accompanied by a 10-fold reduction in adenylyl cyclase activity and only 50% mobilization of intracellular calcium relative to PTH-(1–34). Despite a 60-fold reduction in binding affinity, Bpa6-PTH-(1–34) displayed full potencies for the stimulation of both adenylyl cyclase and intracellular calcium transients (Fig. 1). Substitution at positions 3, 4, and 5 led to analogs with very weak binding affinity, weak stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, and no effect on [Ca2+]i levels (Fig.1). Since [Bpa1,Nle8,18,Arg13,26,27,l-2-Nal23,Tyr34]bPTH-(1–34)NH2(Bpa1-PTH-(1–34)) displayed a biological profile similar to that of the parent peptide and its N-terminal photoreactive residue (Bpa) is located at a strategic site, it was selected for the photoaffinity labeling studies described below. The structural identity of the radioligand125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) was confirmed by its coelution with the non-radioactive [Bpa1,Nle8,18,Arg13,26,27,l-2-Nal23,(3-iodo)-Tyr34]bPTH-(1–34)NH2on analytical RP-HPLC (data not shown). Photocross-linking of 125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) to the hPTH1-Rc yielded a single diffuse band migrating at ∼87 kDa on 7.5% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A,lane 2). This band is receptor-specific, since it is not observed in similar experiments in receptor-lacking parental HEK-293 cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Moreover, formation of the ligand–receptor conjugate was completely inhibited in the presence of excess (1 μm) unlabeled agonist PTH-(1–34) or antagonist PTH-(7–34) (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and4, respectively). The apparent molecular mass of the cross-linked band was similar to that observed for the conjugate obtained through photocross-linking of a position 13 benzophenone-containing PTH-(1–34) analog, [Nle8,18,Lys13(ε-pBz2),2-l- Nal23,Tyr34]bPTH-(1–34)NH2, to the same hPTH1-Rc-expressing cells (28Adams A.E.

Endo-F-mediated deglycosylation of the 87-kDa band shifted the complex to ∼70-kDa band (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) as described previously (17Zhou A.T. Bessalle R. Bisello A. Nakamoto C. Rosenblatt M.

The 87-kDa125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34)–Rc conjugate was purified from 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to a series of chemical and enzymatic cleavages. The first digestion pathway (I) consisted of enzymatic cleavage at the carboxyl side of lysyl residues with Lys-C, followed by chemical cleavage at the carboxyl side of tryptophanyl residues with BNPS-skatole. Exhaustive Lys-C treatment of the 87-kDa ligand–receptor conjugate yielded a single radiolabeled band with apparent molecular mass of ∼11 kDa (Ia) (Fig.3 A, lane 2). Similar treatment of the deglycosylated conjugate (∼66 kDa) yielded a band with the same apparent molecular mass (data not shown), confirming the absence of glycosylation within the Lys-C-generated fragmentIa. BNPS-skatole treatment of the excised and eluted 11-kDa (Ia) fragment produced a single band with apparent mass of ∼7 kDa (Ib) (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). A second digestion pathway (II), the reciprocal ofI, initially yielded a single band migrating at ∼14 kDa (IIa) (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). Lys-C treatment yielded the final fragment migrating at ∼7 kDa (IIb) (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), similar toIb obtained from pathway I. Treatment with CNBr (III) of the purified intact ligand-receptor conjugate in 70% formic acid solution produced a band of very low apparent molecular mass (IIIa) (∼4 kDa, Fig.3 C, lane 2), with electophoretic mobility similar, if not identical, to that of the free radioligand125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) (Fig. 3 C). In addition, CNBr treatment of the 11-kDa (Ia) fragment obtained after Lys-C digestion produced a similar ∼4-kDa band (data not shown). Fig. 4 summarizes schematically the different fragmentation pathways employed in the analysis of hPTH1-Rc–125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) conjugate. PTH-(1–34) stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in COS-7 cells transiently expressing either the hPTH1[M414L], hPTH1[M425L], or the native hPTH-Rc's resulted in very similar dose-response curves (Fig.5 A). Point mutation of either Met414 or Met425 to Leu does not alter the receptor's response to PTH-(1–34). However, the mutants differ in their ability to cross-link with125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) (Fig. 5 B). The transiently transfected hPTH1[M414L] and native hPTH Rcs cross-link to 125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1 and 3, respectively) generating the anticipated ∼87-kDa band corresponding to the125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34)–PTH1Rc conjugate. This cross-linking can be inhibited competitively by 10−6m PTH-(1–34) (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and4). In contrast, the functional transiently transfected hPTH1[M425L] does not cross-link to125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34) (Fig. 5 B,lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that Met425 may be involved in the cross-linking of125I-Bpa1-PTH-(1–34).

The cDNA clone contained an open reading frame that predicts a type II transmembrane protein composed of 483 amino acid residues. The expressed enzyme transferred sulfate to the 6 position of nonreducing GlcNAc in GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc. Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc and various glycosaminoglycans did not serve as acceptors. Expression of the cDNA in COS-7 cells resulted in production of a cell-surface antigen, the epitope of which was NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4(SO4-6)GlcNAc; double transfection with fucosyltransferase IV yielded Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)(SO4-6)GlcNAc antigen. The sulfotransferase mRNA was strongly expressed in the cerebrum, cerebellum, eye, pancreas, and lung of adult mice. In situhybridization revealed that the mRNA was localized in high endothelial venules of mesenteric lymph nodes. The sulfotransferase was concluded to be involved in biosynthesis of glycoconjugates bearing the 6-sulfo N-acetyllactosamine structure such as 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X.

The sialylated paraglobosides (NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer and NeuAcα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glcβ1-Cer) were prepared from human colon and liver carcinoma tissues. The oligosaccharide SL2L4, with the structure NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4(SO4-6)GlcNAcβ1–3(SO4-6)Galβ1–4(SO4-6)GlcNAc, was a generous gift from Dr. Keiichi Yoshida and was coupled to cholesteryl aniline through reductive amination as described previously (28Ohomori K.

A mouse expressed sequence tag sequence (GenbankTM accession no.AA103962) with similarity to the catalytic portion of mouse chondroitin-6-sulfotransferase was amplified by the reverse transcription-PCR method using mouse day 13 embryo total RNA as a template. The sense primer 5′-GTCGTCGGACTGGTGGACGA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CCCAGAGCGTGGTAGTCTGC-3′ were used for PCR amplification, which was carried out at 94 °C for 3 min, with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR product (368 bp) was 32P-labeled with a MegaprimeTM DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to screen the λgt 11 mouse day 7 embryo cDNA library. Hybridization was carried out as described previously (9Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). DNA inserts were isolated from positive λgt 11 clones by digestion withEcoRI and subcloned into pBluescript II SK− (STRATAGENE). Then, the nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklens S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. A cDNA fragment encoding the open reading frame of GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase was amplified by PCR using primers, 5′-ACGAATTCGGGATGAAGGTATTTCGCAGG-3′ and 5′-ATGAATTCTCAAAGCCGGGGCTTCCTGAG-3′, and the cloned cDNA fragment as a template. PCR amplification was carried out at 94 °C 3 min, with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The PCR product including the open reading frame of GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase (nucleotide numbers 467–1921 in Fig. 1 A) was digested withEcoRI and subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). A recombinant plasmid with the correct orientation, pcDNA3-GlcNAc6ST, was used for expression. The plasmid containing the fragment in the reverse orientation, pcDNA3-GlcNAc6STA, was used in control experiments. The previously cloned 1544-bp fragment of the mouse fucosyltransferase IV gene (30Ozawa M. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was subcloned into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector as described above. The plasmid containing the insert in the correct orientation, pcDNA3-FucTIV, was used. COS-7 cells (3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were transfected with 15 μg of relevant plasmids by the DEAE-dextran method (31Aruffo A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Suppl. 14. Wiley Interscience, New York1991Google Scholar). After 65 h of culture in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the dishes and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 1.5 ml/dish of 0.25m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was saved as the extract. For FACS analysis, the transfected cells were cultured for 48 h, passed into 25-cm2 culture flasks (3 × 105 cells/flask), and further cultured for 36 h. Sulfotransferase activities were assayed using various glycosaminoglycans as described previously (10Fukuta M. Inazawa J. Torii T. Tsuzuki K. Shimada E. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32321-32328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 32Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol.

When oligosaccharides were used as substrates, the reaction mixture contained 2.5 mmol of imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5 μmol of MnCl2, 0.1 μmol of AMP, 1.0 μmol of NaF, 25 nmol of oligosaccharides, 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (about 5 × 105 cpm), and 5 μl of the extracts from COS-7 cells in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 5 h, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the reaction tubes in a boiling water bath for 1 min. 35S-Labeled oligosaccharides were separated from 35SO4 and [35S]PAPS by Superdex 30 gel chromatography, and the radioactivity was determined. When GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc was used as an acceptor, sulfotransferase reaction proceeded linearly up to 5 h under the assay conditions. Superdex 30 16/60 column chromatography was performed in 0.2 mNH4HCO3, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Oligosaccharides were monitored by absorption at 210 nm. Paper electrophoresis was carried out in pyridine/acetic acid/water (1:10:400, by volume, pH 4) at 30 V/cm for 40 min. Paper chromatography was performed in 1-butanol/acetic acid/1 mNH4OH (3:2:1, by volume). After electrophoresis or chromatography, the dried paper strips were cut into 1.25-cm segments and radioactivity was determined. HPLC was performed on a Partisil SAX-10 column (4.5 mm × 25 cm) in 5 mmKH2PO4, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The conditions used for chromatography and electrophoresis were described in detail previously (10Fukuta M. Inazawa J. Torii T. Tsuzuki K. Shimada E. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32321-32328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). TLC was performed on aluminum sheets precoated with cellulose (0.1-mm thick, Merck) in ethyl acetate/pyridine/tetrahydrofuran/water/acetic acid (50:22:15:15:4, by volume) (22Spiro R.G. Yasumoto Y. Bhoyroo V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled sulfated GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc was prepared using the expressed GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase (2.1 μg as protein in the extract) as described above except that the concentration of [35S]PAPS was increased to 6-fold and incubation was carried out for 25 h. The 35S-labeled sulfated GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc eluted from the Superdex 30 column was lyophilized, purified by paper electrophoresis, and deacetylated with 70% hydrazine containing 1.0% hydrazine sulfate at 95 °C for 30 h (33Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The deacetylated materials were purified by Superdex 30 chromatography, subjected to deamination with nitrous acid at pH 4, and reduced by NaBH4 (16Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura K. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Finally the sample was dissolved in 60 μl of water and subjected to paper chromatography. The 35S-labeled sulfated 2,5-anhydromannitol sample eluted after paper chromatography or3H-labeled (SO4-3)2,5-anhydromannitol were lyophilized and dissolved in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 80 mm NaIO4. After 20 h of incubation at 4 °C in the dark, 5 μl of 20% ethylene glycol were added to reduce the remaining NaIO4. After standing for 1 h at room temperature, the samples were subjected to paper chromatography. Murine IgM monoclonal antibodies reactive with sulfated carbohydrate epitopes were produced as described previously (34Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K. Izawa M. Nakanishi H. Nakamura S. Ishida H. Kiso M. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11225-11233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). 6-Sulfo Lewis X ceramide was used as the immunogen to produce AG223 antibody, while 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X ceramide was used to produce G72 antibody. On enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (34Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K. Izawa M. Nakanishi H. Nakamura S. Ishida H. Kiso M. Kannagi R. J. Biol.

Cell-surface expression of antigenic epitopes reactive with the monoclonal antibodies was examined by FACS as described previously (35Mitsuoka C. Kawakami-Kimura N. Kasugai-Sawada M. Hiraiwa N. Toda K. Ishida H. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Total RNA (20 μg) was prepared from C57 BL/6J mouse tissues as described elsewhere (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA (10 μg) prepared from murine D3 embryonic stem cells (37Doetschman T.C. Eistetler H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar) was digested for 4 h with appropriate restriction enzymes. The radioactive probe was the same as that used for screening of the mouse day 7 embryo cDNA library. The blots were washed at 55 °C in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS, and finally in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. The membranes were exposed to a BAS-imaging plate and then the radioactivity on the membrane was determined with a BAS 2000 radioimage analyzer (Fuji Film). Mesentric lymph nodes from C57 BL/6J mice were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin staining or in situhybridization as described previously (38Fan Q.W. Yuasa S. Kuno N. Senda T. Kobayashi M. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 30: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As the GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase probe, a 0.6-kbp PstI fragment of the cDNA (nucleotide numbers 962–1561 in Fig.1 A) was subcloned into pBluescript II SK−. Sense and antisense RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription with a digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). We previously cloned a cDNA encoding mouse chondroitin-6-sulfotransferase (39Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). By searching the expressed sequence tag data base, we found a small sequence (GenbankTM accession no. AA103962) with similarity to the catalytic portion of mouse chondroitin-6-sulfotransferase, and obtained the corresponding cDNA fragment by reverse transcription-PCR (nucleotide numbers 1139–1506 in Fig.1 A). Approximately 8 × 105 plaques of a mouse day 7 embryo cDNA library were screened using the cDNA fragment as a probe, and six independent clones were obtained. The nucleotide sequence of the largest cDNA insert (2.2 kbp) was determined (Fig. 1 A). The determined 2150-bp cDNA had a single open reading frame consisting of 483 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 52829 Da and four potentialN-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1 A). The sequence around the putative first ATG codon conformed to Kozak's rule (40Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar), and the upstream region contained an in-frame stop codon. Hydropathy analysis indicated one prominent hydrophobic segment 20 residues in length in the amino-terminal region (Ala8–Leu27), predicting that the protein has type II transmembrane topology (Fig. 1 B). The predicted protein (mGlcNAc6ST) showed 25 and 27% sequence identity to mouse chondroitin-6-sulfotransferase (39Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K.

However, no significant homology in amino acid sequence was observed between the predicted protein and other known sulfotransferases (11Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

The expression plasmid derived from the cDNA, pcDNA3-GlcNAc6ST, was transfected into COS-7 cells, and the extracts of the transfected cells were assayed for sulfotransferase activity using 35S-labeled PAPS as the sulfate donor and various glycoconjugates as sulfate acceptors. Chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, desulfated keratan sulfate, completely desulfatedN-resulfated heparin, and mucin from porcine stomach and from bovine submaxillary gland did not serve as acceptors (data not shown). Since GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferases studied to date transfer sulfate only to GlcNAc residues exposed at the nonreducing end (22Spiro R.G. Yasumoto Y. Bhoyroo V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Degroote S. Lo-Guidice J.-M. Strecker G. Ducourouble M.-P. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29493-29501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we examined GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc as a sulfate acceptor. Superdex 30 chromatography of the reaction mixture indeed revealed a radioactive peak slightly larger than the acceptor, indicating that the acceptor was sulfated (Fig.3 A). The extract from untransfected cells or those transfected with the antisense cDNA showed much less activity (Table I). In contrast, Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc did not serve as an acceptor (Fig. 3 B). This result may imply that sulfate was transferred to nonreducing GlcNAc. However, we could not deny the effect of the size difference of the oligosaccharides. Thus, we used a pentasaccharide, GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc, as an acceptor and found that it was sulfated with the indistinguishable velocity as that for the trisaccharide. These results indicated that the cloned enzyme was a GlcNAc sulfotransferase.Table IOverexpression of GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase in COS-7 cellsPlasmidsSulfotransferase activityaValues shown are averages ± S.D. of triplicate cultures.pmol/h/mg proteinNone1.1 ± 0.7Sense10.6 ± 2.4Antisense1.8 ± 0.9Sulfotransferase activities in the extracts of the cells transfected with the pcDNA3-GlcNAc6ST (sense) or the pcDNA3-GlcNAc6STA (antisense) or no plasmids (none) were determined using GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc as a sulfate acceptor. The activity was calculated from the radioactivity contained in fraction numbers 85–89 on Superdex 30 chromatography (Fig. 3 A).

Open table in a new tab Sulfotransferase activities in the extracts of the cells transfected with the pcDNA3-GlcNAc6ST (sense) or the pcDNA3-GlcNAc6STA (antisense) or no plasmids (none) were determined using GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc as a sulfate acceptor. The activity was calculated from the radioactivity contained in fraction numbers 85–89 on Superdex 30 chromatography (Fig. 3 A). Values obtained in the absence of the acceptor (cf. open circles in Fig.3 A) were subtracted from the values of experimental runs (cf. closed circles in Fig. 3 A). To determine the position to which35SO4 was transferred to GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc, we cleaved theN-acetylglucosaminyl linkage of the radioactive product byN-deacetylation, deamination, and NaBH4reduction. On paper chromatography, the major radioactive product migrated at a position corresponding to sulfated 2,5-anhydromannitol (Fig. 4 A), which is the expected product released from nonreducing sulfated GlcNAc. This result further established that the enzyme transferred sulfate to nonreducing GlcNAc. Then, we determined the position of sulfate in the sulfated 2,5-anhydromannitol. When the 35S-labeled product was analyzed by HPLC, it was co-eluted with (SO4-6)3H-2,5-anhydromannitol (Fig.4 B). (SO4-3)3H-2,5-anhydromannitol was eluted at different fractions (Fig. 4 B). The35S-labeled product also co-migrated with (SO4-6)3H-2,5-anhydromannitol on TLC (Fig.4 C). The 3-sulfo compound migrated faster than the 6-sulfo one under these conditions (Fig. 4 C) (22Spiro R.G. Yasumoto Y. Bhoyroo V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although (SO4-4)3H-2,5-anhydromannitol was not available for comparison, it was described that the 3-sulfo and 4-sulfo compounds are indistinguishable owing to the symmetry of 2,5-anhydromannitol and have the same mobility upon TLC using the solvent system employed in this study (22Spiro R.G. Yasumoto Y. Bhoyroo V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We also examined the structure of the35S-labeled sulfated 2,5-anhydromannitol by periodate oxidation. The 6-sulfo compound is expected to be cleaved, while the 3-sulfo as well as 4-sulfo compounds should be resistant. We observed that the 35S-labeled sulfated 2,5-anhydromannitol was cleaved after periodate oxidation, yielding a smear of band migrating slower than the sulfated 2,5-anhydromannitol upon paper chromatography and that (SO4-3)2,5-anhydromannitol was resistant to the treatment (data not shown). Thus, the sulfated anhydromannitol was identified to be (SO4-6)2,5-anhydromannitol. In conclusion,35SO4 was transferred to position 6 of GlcNAc residue located at the nonreducing end of GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc. Therefore, the cloned enzyme is a GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase. We found that a significant portion of COS-7 cells transfected with the sense cDNA of GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase expressed G72 antigen, the epitope of which is 6-sulfo sialyl N-acetyllactosamine (Fig.5 B). The parental cells (Fig.5 A) or cells transfected with the antisense cDNA (Fig.5 C) did not express the antigen. Neuraminidase digestion abolished the antigenicity (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that the sulfotransferase is involved in synthesis of 6-sulfo sialylN-acetyllactosamine antigen. As the next step, we doubly transfected COS-7 cells with the GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase cDNA and fucosyltransferase IV cDNA. The latter enzyme is known to form Lewis X structure by transferring fucose to N-acetyllactosamine (41Lowe J.B. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Marks R.M. Macher B.A. Kelly R.J.

Cell. 1990; 63: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The doubly transfected cells became positive for AG223 antigen, whose epitope is 6-sulfo Lewis X (Fig. 5 F), while cells transfected with either cDNA alone did not (Fig. 5, Dand E). Among the adult mouse organs examined, GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase was strongly expressed in the cerebrum, cerebellum, eye, lung, and pancreas (Fig. 6 A). Moderate signals were also detected in the intestine, uterus, ovary, and peripheral as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 6 A). The size of the major transcript was 3.9 kb. On Southern blots, a single band was reactive with the sulfotransferase probe after digestion withEcoRI, EcoRV, or SacI, indicating that this GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase was a single copy gene (Fig. 6 B). In situhybridization was performed to determine the sites of the sulfotransferase expression in mesenteric lymph nodes. HEV, where the ligand for L-selectin is located (43Imai T. Singer M.S. Fennie C. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), are present in the paracortex (Fig. 7, A and B,arrows/arrowheads). They have a cuboidal endothelium with fairly large oval nuclei and a moderate amount of cytoplasm (Fig.7 D). The message of the sulfotransferase was specifically expressed in this endothelium (Fig. 7, B andE). We cloned a cDNA encoding a GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase. The enzyme transferred sulfate to an exposed GlcNAc residue β1–3 glycosidically linked to Galβ1–4GlcNAc, but not to GlcNAc residues contained in Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc. To date, GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferases have been studied using extracts or membrane preparations (22Spiro R.G. Yasumoto Y. Bhoyroo V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Degroote S. Lo-Guidice J.-M. Strecker G. Ducourouble M.-P. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol.

The enzyme in extracts from human respiratory mucosa catalyzes sulfation of mucin carbohydrate chains (23Degroote S. Lo-Guidice J.-M. Strecker G. Ducourouble M.-P. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29493-29501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), while that in the rat liver Golgi membrane is involved in the synthesis of NeuAcα2–3(6)Galβ1–4(SO4-6)GlcNAc, which is linked to the mannosyl core of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides (22Spiro R.G. Yasumoto Y. Bhoyroo V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In both cases, GlcNAc residues at nonreducing ends serve as acceptors, but internal GlcNAc residues are poor acceptors. Thus, biosynthesis of the 6-sulfoN-acetyllactosamine structure has been concluded to start from 6-sulfation of GlcNAc followed by galactosylation by β1–4-galactosyltransferase (22Spiro R.G. Yasumoto Y. Bhoyroo V. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Degroote S. Lo-Guidice J.-M. Strecker G. Ducourouble M.-P. Roussel P. Lamblin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29493-29501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The acceptor specificity of the cloned sulfotransferase agrees with those of the sulfotransferases described above. The cloned sulfotransferase was found to be involved in the synthesis of cell-surface antigenic epitopes, 6-sulfo sialylN-acetyllactosamine and 6-sulfo Lewis X. These results indicated that the enzyme can be involved in the formation of 6-sulfoN-acetyllactosamine structures located in cell-surface glycoproteins and/or glycolipids. It remains to be clarified whether the enzyme also participates in biosynthesis of keratan sulfate. Since 6-sulfo sialyl N-acetyllactosamine formed by the sulfotrasferase is converted to 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X by fucosyltransferase VII, which is involved in expression of selectin ligands (44Mal′y P. Thall A.D. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 643-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), our results have demonstrated that the cloned enzyme participates in formation of 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X. L-selectin located on lymphocytes plays a key role in their initial attachment to the HEV of lymph nodes (45Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). An L-selectin ligand in HEV of lymph nodes is GlyCAM-1, whose sulfation has been found to be required for its function (46Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. Nature. 1993; 361: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). GlyCAM-1 has two sulfatedN-acetyllactosamine structures, i.e. 6′-sulfo silayl Lewis X and 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, of which the former is the major structure (47Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whether 6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis X or 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X is important for binding to L-selectin has not been settled at the present time (34Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K. Izawa M.

Furthermore, anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies that bind to 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X reacted to HEV in lymph nodes and inhibited the binding of L-selectin to HEV, whereas antibodies that bind to 6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis X did not react to HEV (35Mitsuoka C.

In view of the localization of GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferase transcripts in HEV of lymph nodes, the sulfotransferase is a likely candidate involved in sulfation of an L-selectin ligand. We thank A.

Previously, it has been demonstrated that a peptide, P1, corresponding to residues 190–202 in the γ-chain of fibrinogen, binds to αMβ2 and blocks the interaction of fibrinogen with the receptor and that Asp199 within P1 is important to activity. We have demonstrated, however, that a double mutation of Asp199-Gly200 to Gly-Ala in the recombinant γ-module of fibrinogen, spanning region 148–411, did not abrogate αMβ2 recognition and considered that other binding sites in the γ-module may participate in the receptor recognition. We have found that synthetic peptide P2, duplicating γ377–395, inhibited adhesion of αMβ2-transfected cells to immobilized D100 fragment of fibrinogen in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, immobilized P2 directly supported efficient adhesion of the αMβ2-expressing cells, including activated and non-activated monocytoid cells. The I domain of αMβ2 was implicated in recognition of P2, as the biotinylated recombinant αMI domain specifically bound to both P2 and P1 peptides. Analysis of overlapping peptides spanning P2 demonstrated that it may contain two functional sequences: γ377–386 (P2-N) and γ383–395 (P2-C), with the latter sequence being more active. In the three-dimensional structure of the γ-module, γ190–202 and γ377–395 reside in close proximity, forming two antiparallel β strands.

The engagement of Fg by αMβ2 on activated leukocytes and by ICAM-1 on endothelial cells mediates leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall and subsequent transmigration in vitro and in vivo (1Languino L.R.

The binding of αMβ2 to fibrinogen/fibrin also may result in adhesion of monocytes and neutrophils at sites of vascular injury, such as at atherosclerotic plaques, which are rich in Fg derivatives (4Bini A.

Furthermore, Fg and its derivatives directly promote the accumulation of inflammatory cells on biomaterial implants in animal models (6Tang L. Eaton J.W. J. Exp.

A low molecular weight degradation product, D30 fragment, generated by plasmin proteolysis of Fg was shown to produce dose-dependent inhibition of Fg binding to stimulated monocytes and neutrophils (8Altieri D.C.

Furthermore, one of a series of overlapping peptides, spanning the constituent γ-chain of D30 (γ89–206), inhibited 125I-Fg binding to activated THP-1 cells (9Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide, designated P1, corresponded to γ190–202. A variant peptide in which Asp199 was either deleted or mutated to Glu or Asn was substantially less potent in inhibiting Fg binding to αMβ2-bearing cells (9Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this residue may play a role in the receptor recognition. In addition, when P1 was immobilized onto a surface and implanted into mice, it supported an inflammatory response (7Tang L. Ugarova T.P. Plow E.F. Eaton J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the apparent affinity of P1 for αMβ2 was substantially lower than that of intact Fg (9Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the recombinant γ-module, which encompasses residues 148–411 of the γ-chain of Fg (10Medved L. Litvinovich S. Ugarova T. Matsuka Y. Ingham K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that either other Fg sequences, most probably present within the γ-module, contribute to the recognition of Fg by αMβ2or that P1 must adopt a conformation within Fg that is favorably constrained for αMβ2 recognition. Consistent with this possibility, synthetic peptides other than P1 inhibit the interaction of Fg with neutrophils (11Arnaout M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Loike J.D.

These cells bind Fg exclusively via αMβ2, thereby offering an advantage over isolated leukocytes and their derivative cell lines. We identify a novel peptide, designated P2, corresponding to γ377–395 from the COOH-terminal part of the γ-chain of Fg, which is a potent inhibitor of αMβ2-mediated adhesion to Fg derivatives. In fact, on a molar basis P2 is more potent than the previously described P1 peptide. In the three-dimensional structure of the γ-module of Fg, the P1 and P2 sequences reside adjacent to one another as part of two antiparallel β strands and may form a complex and unique binding site for αMβ2.

A recombinant wild-type γ-module corresponding to residues 148–411 of the human Fg γ-chain was produced inEscherichia coli using a pET-20b expression vector as described (10Medved L. Litvinovich S. Ugarova T. Matsuka Y. Ingham K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A mutant γ-module, in which Asp199-Gly200 were mutated to Gly-Ala, was produced using TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). The pET-20b construct containing DNA encoding the γ-module was modified by site-directed mutagenesis using two mutagenic primers. One primer, 5′-GTGTTTCAGAAGAGACTTGgcGcCAGTGTAGATTTCAAGAAAAAC, introduced the desired mutation (the lowercase letters indicate the mutagenic bases) and an unique restriction site for NarI (underlined) to facilitate further analysis. Another primer, 5′-GCGGCCGCACTgGAGCACCACCAC, eliminated the unique XhoI restriction site in the polylinker region of the target plasmid to facilitate screening. The screening for the desired mutation was performed by Nar I digestion of the plasmid DNA isolated from selected colonies of DH5α cells. The mutation was also confirmed by sequencing of the entire DNA fragment encoding the γ-module. The BL21 Lys S E. coli host cells were then transformed with the mutant plasmid, and the mutant γ-module was prepared following the procedure previously described for the recombinant wild-type γ-module (10Medved L. Litvinovich S. Ugarova T. Matsuka Y. Ingham K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Specifically, as revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis of the bacterial lysates, the yield of the mutant γ-module was substantially lower. As the mutant was not a dominant protein in the pellet of the lysates, two additional purification steps were introduced. First, the mutant was partially purified by size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 equilibrated with 8 m urea and then refolded by the protocol described earlier (10Medved L. Litvinovich S. Ugarova T. Matsuka Y. Ingham K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The remaining contaminants were subsequently removed by size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 equilibrated with TBS and 1 mm Ca2+. The purity of the resulting mutant was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino acid sequence analysis. The fluorescence-detected melting curve of the mutant (data not shown) was essentially the same as that of the wild-type protein reported previously (10Medved L. Litvinovich S. Ugarova T. Matsuka Y. Ingham K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), indicating that the mutant was properly folded. Recombinant αMI domain was produced and purified essentially as described earlier with minor modification (23Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA of the αMI domain was amplified using the following primers: 5′-CTCCGAGGATCCCCTCAAGAGGATAGTGACATT and 5′-TTGCTCGAGTCAGCTGAAGCCTTCCTG, and inserted in the expression vector pET-32a (Novagen, Madison, WI) with restriction enzymesBamHI and XhoI. To express the αMI domain as a fusion protein with thioredoxin, BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the above vector and grown to log phase in TB media. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C, and the fusion protein from the inclusion bodies was dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl. After refolding in 20 mm TBS, the fusion protein was purified using ProBond resin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To obtain the αMI domain, the fusion partner (thioredoxin) was removed by thrombin cleavage, and the I domain was purified using Q-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The αMI domain was conjugated withN-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin ester (Calbiochem) as described (24Shattil S.J. Cunningham M. Hoxie J.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 307-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to selected sequences in Fg were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 430 peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a preparative C18 Vydac column using a 5–90% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Authenticity and purity of the peptides were verified by mass spectroscopy and by high performance liquid chromatography. Peptides H19 and H20, duplicating Fg sequences γ340–357 and γ351–370, respectively, and peptide P1-Scr (FRLGWVQTSVDKG), were used as controls. Selected peptides were conjugated to ovalbumin using 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide as a cross-linker (Pierce) (25Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the conjugates were stored at −70 °C until used. For radiolabeling of peptides P2 (γ377–395) and P1 (γ190–202), a variant P1 peptide with KY added to the NH2 terminus of γ190–202 was synthesized, whereas the naturally occurring Tyr377 at the NH2 terminus in P2 served as the target for iodination. These peptides were radiolabeled with Na125I using a modified chloramine-T procedure (26Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9477-9482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeled peptides were separated from free125I on a Sep-Pak C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA). After extensive washing with sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0,125I-peptide was eluted with 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic solution, and the sample was lyophilized. The amounts of peptides immobilized onto the microtiter plates used in cell adhesion assays were measured by two different approaches. In the first, peptides were immobilized on the plastic for 3 h at 37 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and the concentration was determined by BCA method according to manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). In the second approach, plates were coated with radiolabeled peptides, blocked with 0.5% PVD and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound peptides were solubilized in 2% SDS + 0.5 n NaOH, and radioactivity was counted in a γ counter. The amount of peptide bound to plastic wells was calculated on the basis of the amount of radioactivity recovered and the specific activity of the peptide. The efficiency of peptide immobilization on the plastic as determined by both methods was similar. At an input concentration of 0.1–40 μg/ml (0.2 ml), 10 and 8% of added P1 and P2, respectively, were immobilized. The development of 293 embryonic kidney cells expressing αMβ2 (16Zhang L. Plow E.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) has been described previously. The cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES, and antibiotics. THP-1 monocytic cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 2.5 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin. The wells of tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with varying concentrations of peptides, peptide-ovalbumin conjugates, recombinant γ-modules, or D100 fragment for 3 h at 37 °C. The coated wells were then post-coated with 0.5% PVD for 1 h at 22 °C. αMβ2- and αM-expressing cells, grown in 10-cm Petri dishes for 24 h as subconfluent monolayers, were harvested with cell-dissociating buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 min at 22 °C and washed twice in HBSS/HEPES solution containing 10 mg/ml BSA. These cells were labeled with Na251CrO4 (0.5 mCi/ml) for 30 min at 22 °C, washed twice and resuspended at 5 × 105/ml in HBSS/HEPES supplemented with 1 mmCa2+, 1 mm Mg2+, and 10 mg/ml BSA. Aliquots (100 μl) of the labeled cells were added to each well. For THP-1 cells, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, radiolabeled, and resuspended as described for the αMβ2-bearing cells. For inhibition experiments, the cells were mixed with selected concentrations of test peptides and incubated for 15 min at 22 °C before adding to the coated wells. The cells were incubated on the adhesive substrates for 25 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The nonadherent cells were removed by three washes with HBSS containing 10 mg/ml BSA. The adherent cells were solubilized with 2% SDS, and51Cr was quantitated in a β counter. In selected experiments, the cells were incubated with mAbs OKM1, 44a, 904, and IB4 directed against the α and β subunits of αMβ2 for 15 min at 22 °C and then added to the wells coated with P1 or P2. 96-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with 25 pmol of P2, P1 and control H19 peptides for 3 h at 37 °C and post-coated with 1% BSA for 1 h at 22 °C. 10 μg/ml biotinylated αMI domain in 0.05 m TBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 1 mmCa2+, and 1 mm Mg2+ was added to the wells and incubated for 3 h at 22 °C. In parallel, the same amount of the αMI domain was incubated with 1 μg/ml neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF), 50 μg/ml P1, and P2. After washing, streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The αMI domain binding was detected by reaction with p-nitrophenyl phosphate, measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Alternatively, the binding of a nonlabeled P2-related peptide, γ373–385, to the immobilized αMI domain was detected with mAb 2G5, which recognizes an epitope within this peptide (18Zamarron C. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16193-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of this mAb to the peptide was measured by reaction with goat anti-mouse IgG, conjugated to alkaline-phosphatase and using p-nitrophenyl phosphate for detection. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses were performed to assess the expression of αM or αMβ2 on the surface of transfected cells or THP-1 cells. The cells were harvested as described above, and 106 cells were incubated with the selected mAbs in HBSS/HEPES buffer. mAbs OKM1 and 44a were added at 15 μg/200 μl of cell suspension and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells then were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (at 1: 100 dilution) for additional 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the cells were washed and analyzed on a FACStar (Beckton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Recently, we have shown that the recombinant γ-module (γ148–411), which preserves the conformational and functional properties of this region in native Fg and contains the previously identified αMβ2binding site at γ190–202 (GWTVFQKRLDGSV), supports adhesion of the αMβ2-bearing cells but not mock-transfected cells (10Medved L. Litvinovich S. Ugarova T. Matsuka Y. Ingham K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We further observed that the γ-module inhibited αMβ2-mediated adhesion to the D100 fragment of Fg, and its inhibitory potency was about 20-fold greater than that reported for the synthetic peptide P1 corresponding to the γ190–202. To consider whether other sequences within γ148–411 might contribute to the recognition of Fg by αMβ2, we expressed a mutant γ-module in which Asp199-Gly200 within the P1 sequence were replaced by Gly-Ala. Previous studies have indicated (9Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Asp199 is of major importance in the recognition of P1 by the receptor. As shown in Fig. 1, when the recombinant proteins were immobilized, the mutant γ-module supported adhesion of the αMβ2-expressing cells as efficiently as the wild-type γ-module. Adhesion to both proteins was αMβ2-dependent as NIF, a specific inhibitor of this integrin (28Moyle M. Foster D.L. McGrath D.E. Brown S.M. Laroche Y. De Meutter J. Bogowitz C.A. Fried V.A. Ely J.A. Soule H.R. Vlasuk G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10008-10015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), effectively blocked binding (data not shown). These results prompted us to search for other sequences within the γ-module that might be involved in αMβ2 recognition. The crystal structure of the Fg γ-module encompassing residues γ144–411 (29Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Cote H.C.F. LeTrong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) revealed that a β strand containing portions of P1 is adjacent to a second β strand formed by residues γ380–390. This proximity led us to consider whether this second β strand contributes to αMβ2 recognition. Accordingly, we synthesized a peptide, designated P2, corresponding to γ377–395, which encompasses this β strand and the flanking residues. As shown in Fig. 2, this peptide inhibited adhesion of the αMβ2-expressing cells to the immobilized Fg derivative, D100, in a dose-dependent manner. On a molar basis, P2 was 12.5 ± 3.4-fold (n = 11) more potent than P1. Although a gradual drift in the αMβ2-expressing cells toward a more adhesive phenotype was observed after several months in culture, which influenced the absolute concentrations of the peptides required for inhibition of adhesion, P2 was consistently 10–15-fold more potent than P1 within the same experiment; 50% inhibition was attained at 0.4–4.3 μm P2 compared with 5–80 μm P1. A second difference in the effect of two peptides was noted with respect to the maximal inhibition observed. While P2 was able to produce 80–90% inhibition at concentrations of 3.5–17 μm, maximal inhibition by P1 did not exceed 60–65%, even at the highest concentration of P1 tested (130 μm maximal testable concentration). Similar results were obtained when microtiter plates were coated with the recombinant γ-module (data not shown). Specificity of the inhibitory effects of both P1 and P2 was apparent. Three control peptides: H19 (γ340–357) and H20 (γ350–375), originating from the neighboring region of the γ-chain of fibrinogen, and a scrambled P1 peptide (P1-Scr), did not inhibit adhesion of the αMβ2-expressing cells to D100(results for H19 are shown). Furthermore, neither P2 nor P1 affected adhesion of the cells to gelatin, a reaction not mediated by αMβ2, and neither peptide affected cell viability as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The capacity of P2 to directly support αMβ2-mediated adhesion was tested. P2 was immobilized onto tissue culture wells in free form or as a conjugate with ovalbumin, and the αMβ2-expressing cells were added. As shown quantitatively in Fig.3 A and visually in Fig.3 B, P2 supported efficient adhesion. Comparison of P2 and P1 demonstrated that both peptides were almost equally efficient in the supporting of αMβ2-mediated adhesion. Adhesion was concentration-dependent, and about 60–65% of added cells adhered to each peptide (maximal adhesion). Three control peptides, P1-Scr, H19, and H20, did not support significant adhesion (results for P1-Scr are shown). Furthermore, mock-transfected cells adhered poorly to P2 as well as to P1 (data not shown). The molar concentrations of each immobilized P2 and P1 required for half-maximal adhesion were 2.4 ± 0.8 and 7.2 ± 1.5 pmol (Fig.3 A). These values are based upon direct quantitation of the amount of each immobilized peptide (see “Experimental Procedures”). When P2 and P1 were conjugated to ovalbumin, the maximal adhesion to the immobilized P2-ovalbumin conjugate was about 2-fold higher than to P1-ovalbumin (data not shown). Although conjugation to protein carrier has been shown to improve the adhesive properties of some peptides (30Humphries M.J. Komoriya A. Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6886-6892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), coupling did not significantly affect the activity of P1 and P2. It should be noted that, although P1 in solution was a relatively poor inhibitor of the αMβ2-mediated adhesion (Fig. 2), upon immobilization, it supported adhesion almost as well as immobilized P2. The low inhibitory activity of soluble P1 and its propensity to aggregate has been reported previously(9). Thus, soluble P1 may not adopt a preferred conformation for interaction with αMβ2. We next tested the ability of P2 to support adhesion of THP-1 monocytoid cells that bear αMβ2 and are known to adhere to P1 (9Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, P2 supported adhesion of the THP-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and the extent of adhesion to P2 was greater than for P1. Adhesion to both immobilized peptides was enhanced 1.2–2-fold by PMA stimulation of the cells. Under the same conditions, with and without PMA stimulation, P1-Scr did not support cell adhesion (data not shown). The specificity of αMβ2-P2 interaction was substantiated further using function-blocking mAbs, which recognize αM and β2 subunits. Adhesion of αMβ2-expressing cells to three adhesive substrates, P2, P1, and D100 fragment, was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by mAb 44a to the αMsubunit. At 5 μg/ml, this mAb produced 71% inhibition of adhesion to P1, 55% to P2, and 87% to D100 fragment (TableI). mAb IB4 to the β2subunit was also inhibitory; at the 5 μg/ml concentration, it reduced adhesion of the αMβ2-expressing cells to P1, P2, and D100 by 67, 50, and 77%, respectively. In contrast, another anti-αM mAb, 904, was moderately inhibitory, and mAb OKM1 was not effective. In parallel experiments, mAbs 44a and IB4 also inhibited adhesion of PMA-activated THP-1 cells to immobilized P2 and P1 (Table I). A control mAb w6/32 against the class I major histocompatibility complex was consistent"

However, βAPP can elude the intracellular cleavage and reach the cell surface as a full-length mature product, and α-secretase activity may occur also at the plasma membrane in several cell systems (10Nordstedt C.

Deletion of either the cytoplasmic domain or the YENPTY sequence resulted in reduced βAPP internalization, increased secretion of sβAPPα and P3, and significantly diminished Aβ release (6De Strooper B.

Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar). Its location and structural features are characteristic of a receptor for signal transduction. Screening for potential proteins capable of interacting with its cytoplasmic domain led to the identification of proteins containing phosphotyrosine interaction/phosphotyrosine binding (PI/PTB) domains: Fe65, X11, and their homologues (23Fiore F.

The PI/PTB domain was first identified as the component of the adaptor protein Shc (Src homology 2/collagen homology) that binds to activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors (29Kavanaugh W.M.

Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), suggesting a general role for this domain in protein-protein interactions and signal transduction. Fe65 was originally proposed as a transcriptional activator (32Duilio A. Zambrano N. Mogavero A.R. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Russo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a WW domain (a variant of Src homology 3 domains) (33Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem.

Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), suggests that it is likely to be involved in signal transduction. The expression of Fe65 appears to be enriched in brain in human, rat, and mouse (25Bressler S.L. Gray M.D. Sopher B.L. Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Pham D.G. Dinulos M.B. Fukuchi K. Sisodia S.S.

The X11 gene was originally isolated as a candidate gene for Friedreich ataxia, an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder that affects the cerebellum, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves (35Duclos F. Boschert U. Sirugo G. Mandel J.L. Hen R. Koenig M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The X11 protein is a neuron-specific protein of unknown function that contains two postsynaptic density protein, disc-large, zo-1 (PDZ), domains at its carboxyl terminus in addition to a PI/PTB domain (31Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of the interaction of X11 and Fe65 with βAPP indicated that the YENPTY motif located at the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of βAPP is essential for its association with the PI/PTB domains (23Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 24Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The interaction of βAPP and the PI/PTB domains of X11 and Fe65 is phosphorylation-independent (23Fiore F. Zambrano N.

Lee C.H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Kuriyan J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The binding site of the Fe65 PI/PTB domain appears to be different from that of X11 as mutations within the YENPTY motif differentially affect the binding of X11 and Fe65 (24Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the X11 PI/PTB domain bound to the βAPP peptide (QNGEYENPTYKFFEQ) revealed that the sequence-specific recognition extends to peptide residues that are carboxyl-terminal to the YENPTY motif (36Zhang Z. Lee C.H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Kuriyan J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6141-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Association of PI/PTB domain-containing proteins with the coated pit-mediated internalization signal of βAPP may affect the patterns of βAPP trafficking, generation of Aβ as well as of soluble βAPP, and normal physiologic function. The effect of X11 binding on βAPP processing was studied in different cell lines transiently or permanently transfected with the wild type or mutated βAPP cDNAs. We demonstrate that mutations in βAPP that impair interactions with X11 result in increased proteolysis by an α-secretase. Cotransfection of βAPP with X11 produces the opposite effect. Furthermore, overexpression of both X11 and βAPP results in accumulation of cell-associated βAPP and decreased secretion of Aβ. Mouse neuroblastoma N2a, human embryonic kidney 293 and African green monkey kidney COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and human glial U251 cells were cultured in RPMI medium at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The wild type or mutated βAPP695 cDNAs and the X11 cDNA were cloned into pRK5 vector as described previously (24Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were transiently transfected into N2a, 293, and COS-1 culture cell lines using calcium phosphate (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). U251 cells were stably transfected using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and selected with Geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.). N2a cells stably transfected with wild type βAPP695 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. S. S. Sisodia) and 293 cells stably transfected with human wild type cystatin C gene (38Wei L. Berman Y. Castaño E.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11806-11814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected with X11 or pRK5 vector cDNAs. Overexpression and secretion of βAPP were confirmed by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates and medium proteins with anti-βAPP66–81 antibody (22C11) (Boehringer Mannheim) and with anti-Aβ1–17antibody (6E10) (Senetek). Overexpression of Myc-tagged X11 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates proteins with anti-myc antibody (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transiently or stably transfected culture cells were labeled 24 h after transfection. Cells were incubated with 0.3 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine EXPRE35S35S (DuPont) in methionine/cysteine-free medium with 5% dialyzed serum for a pulse of 20 min at 37 °C. Following a wash with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, the cells were chased in complete medium with 150 μg/ml methionine at 37 °C for different periods. The media were collected and spun at 4500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). Equal amounts of total proteins from cell lysates or equal volumes of media based upon the relative concentration of total proteins in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Aβ1–17 antibody (6E10) or anti-βAPP66–81 antibody (22C11) overnight at 4 °C and with γ-Bind Plus Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. In control experiments, cell lysates and medium proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-cystatin C antibody (Axell) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with lysis buffer and phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, boiled in sample buffer (1% SDS, 3% glycerol, 1.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8), and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The gels were enhanced with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray films. The protein bands were scanned using Adobe PhotoShop and quantitated using the NIH Image program. Relative intensity of the bands was calculated as a percentage of the intensity of the protein band in cell lysates at time 0 of the chase. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Data were compared between experimental groups using one-way analysis of variance combined with Fisher's test. In all cases, p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Direct quantitation of incorporated radioactivity was performed in vials containing liquid scintillation mixture (Beckman) by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Beckman model LS6000IC). Significant positive correlation between quantification done by densitometry and direct measurements of incorporated radioactivity were obtained (r = 0.952 ± 0.008; p < 0.0002). The half-life of intracellular βAPP was calculated from pulse-chase experiments performed for chase periods of up to 8 h. N2a cells, stably transfected with βAPP cDNA, were labeled 24 h after transient transfection with vector or X11 cDNAs. Cells were incubated with 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine EXPRE35S35S (DuPont) in methionine/cysteine-free medium with 5% dialyzed serum for 4 h at 37 °C. The media were collected and spun at 4500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal volumes of media, based upon the relative concentration of total proteins in cell lysates, were immunoprecipitated with anti-Aβ1–17 antibody (6E10) and anti-Aβ17–24 antibody (4G8) (Senetek) overnight at 4 °C and with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 5 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with lysis buffer and phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, boiled in sample buffer, and separated by 16.5% Tris-Tricine PAGE. The gels were enhanced with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray films. N2a cells stably transfected with βAPP cDNA were transiently transfected with vector or X11 cDNA. 24 h after transfection, the cells were transferred to serum-reduced medium consisting of 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Opti-MEM, and 0.2% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. The media were collected, spun at 4500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and supplemented with protease inhibitors (82 μm antipain, 0.1 mm bestatin, 2 mm EDTA-Na2, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 0.2 mml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 0.01% NaN3). Immunodetection of Aβ in the media was performed as described previously (17Turner R.S. Suzuki N. Chyung A.S. Younkin S.G. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8966-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 39Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). In brief, Aβ in samples were captured with BAN-50, a monoclonal antibody specific for Aβ1–10. Peptides terminating at amino acid 40 were specifically detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BA-27 monoclonal antibody, and peptides terminating at amino acid 42 were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BC-05 monoclonal antibody. This sandwich ELISA has a detection limit of <1 fmol/well. We have previously analyzed the binding sites on βAPP for the X11 PI/PTB domain, using site-directed mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic domain of βAPP (24Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The different mutations were placed into full-length βAPP695(see Fig. 1 for the sequence of the carboxyl-terminal domain of βAPP). We found that deletion of the last 18 amino acids severely inhibited the ability of the X11 PI/PTB domain to bind βAPP. Similarly, two mutations within the YENPTY motif, Y682G and N684A, impaired the binding of the protein interaction domain to βAPP (24Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments were performed to study the effect of these mutations on βAPP processing. Mouse neuroblastoma N2a, human embryonic kidney (293), and monkey kidney (COS-1) cells that were transiently transfected and human glial (U251) cells that were stably transfected with wild type or mutated βAPP cDNAs were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min and chased for different time periods. Results of the SDS-PAGE temporal profile of βAPP expression and secretion are shown in Fig.2. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates proteins revealed that mutations within the X11 interactive domain of βAPP do not significantly affect the decrease of intracellular βAPP (Fig. 3, A, C, E, andG). Immunoprecipitation of medium proteins with anti-Aβ1–17 antibody (6E10) revealed that the secretion of soluble βAPP via the α-secretase pathway (sβAPPα) was increased in all of the cell lines transfected with βAPP lacking the 18 carboxyl-terminal amino acids, which include the YENPTY motif, when compared with cells transfected with wild type cDNA (data not shown). These results are compatible with previous reports of the effect of deletion of either the cytoplasmic domain or the YENPTY sequence of βAPP on its processing (6De Strooper B. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

We demonstrate that mutation of the amino-terminal tyrosine (Y682G) or asparagine (N684A) within the YENPTY motif also caused increased secretion of sβAPPα (Fig. 3, B, D, F, and H).Figure 3Inhibition of X11 binding to the YENPTY motif of βAPP caused increased secretion of soluble βAPP via the α-secretase pathway. N2a (A and B), 293 (C and D) and COS-1 cells (E andF) that were transiently transfected and U251 cells (G and H) that were stably transfected with wild type or mutated βAPP cDNAs were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min and chased for different time periods. Cell lysates (A, C, E, andG) and medium proteins (B, D, F, andH) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Aβ1–17antibody 6E10, separated by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray film. The protein bands were scanned and quantitated. Relative intensity of the bands was calculated as percentage of the intensity of the protein band of cell lysates at the beginning of the chase (time 0). Mean and S.D. from 3–5 different experiments are presented. p values <0.05 for the comparison of the mutated βAPP with wild type βAPP were considered to be statistically significant (*).

Immunoprecipitation of cell lysate proteins with anti-Aβ1–17 antibody (6E10) revealed that cotransfection of βAPP and X11 delayed intracellular βAPP depletion (Fig. 4). The half-life of intracellular βAPP in cells cotransfected with βAPP and X11 was prolonged in comparison to cells transfected with βAPP alone (Fig.5). Half-life in this system refers to turnover rate, dependent on both degradation and secretion. Although X11 overexpression attenuated the depletion of intracellular βAPP in all cell lines tested, the magnitude of the effect was different, with the greatest effect observed in 293 cells and the least in COS-1 cells. Delayed intracellular βAPP depletion was also observed following immunoprecipitation of N2a cell lysates proteins with anti-βAPP66–81 antibody (22C11) (Fig.6).Figure 5Cotransfection of X11 and βAPP resulted in prolongation of the half-life of cellular βAPP.

https://openalex.org/W2122509443,"Both BTG1 and BTG2 are involved in cell-growth control. BTG2 expression is regulated by p53, and its inactivation in embryonic stem cells leads to the disruption of DNA damage-induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying Btg-mediated functions, we looked for possible functional partners of Btg1 and Btg2. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, protein-binding assays, and transient transfection assays in HeLa cells, we demonstrated the physicalin vitro and in vivo interaction of both Btg1 and Btg2 with the mouse protein mCaf1 (i.e. mouse CCR4-associated factor 1). mCaf1 was identified through its interaction with the CCR4 protein, a component of a general transcription multisubunit complex, which, in yeast, regulates the expression of different genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and progression. These data suggest that Btg proteins, through their association with mCaf1, may participate, either directly or indirectly, in the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in the control of the cell cycle. Finally, we found that box B, one of two conserved domains which define the Btg family, plays a functional role, namely that it is essential to the Btg-mCaf1 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1994249214,"Prostaglandin receptors may be activated by their cognate ligand or by free radical catalyzed isoprostanes, products of arachidonic acid peroxidation. For example, prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) causes hypertrophy of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, via the PGF2α receptor (FP). However, the FP may also be activated by the isoprostane, 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III (Kunapuli, P., Lawson, J. A., Rokach, J., and FitzGerald, G. A.(1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 27147–27154).Both ligands induce myocyte hypertrophy with overlapping potencies. Interestingly, the hypertrophic effects of these two agonists on cardiomyocytes are additive. Furthermore, the preference of these two agonists for activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways differs in several respects. Thus, PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III stimulate inositol phosphate formation with EC50 values of 50 ± 12 nm and 3.5 ± 0.6 μm, respectively. Moreover, PGF2α causes a robust activation (∼50-fold) of Erk2, whereas 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III has no effect. Similarly, PGF2α causes translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and also results in a 7-fold increment in the formation of 6-keto-PGF1α, whereas 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III exerts no effect on this pathway. On the other hand, both agonists are equally potent in activating JNK1 and c-Jun, whereas neither activates the p38 kinase. Both PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III activate the p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), but not Akt, downstream of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). However, both wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70S6K activity, inhibit 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III -induced myocyte hypertrophy, with IC50 values of 60 ± 12 and 3 ± 1.7 nm, respectively, whereas neither compound abrogates the PGF2α-mediated response. Thus, both PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III induce myocyte hypertrophy via discrete signaling pathways. Although both agonists signal via the JNK pathway to initiate changes in c-Jun-dependent gene transcription, PGF2αpreferentially activates the MEK-Erk2- cytosolic phospholipase A2 pathway. In contrast, the PI3K-p70S6Kpathway appears to be essential for 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III-induced myocyte hypertrophy. Prostaglandin receptors may be activated by their cognate ligand or by free radical catalyzed isoprostanes, products of arachidonic acid peroxidation.

Thus, PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III stimulate inositol phosphate formation with EC50 values of 50 ± 12 nm and 3.5 ± 0.6 μm, respectively. Moreover, PGF2α causes a robust activation (∼50-fold) of Erk2, whereas 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III has no effect. Similarly, PGF2α causes translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and also results in a 7-fold increment in the formation of 6-keto-PGF1α, whereas 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III exerts no effect on this pathway. On the other hand, both agonists are equally potent in activating JNK1 and c-Jun, whereas neither activates the p38 kinase. Both PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III activate the p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), but not Akt, downstream of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). However, both wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70S6K activity, inhibit 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III -induced myocyte hypertrophy, with IC50 values of 60 ± 12 and 3 ± 1.7 nm, respectively, whereas neither compound abrogates the PGF2α-mediated response. Thus, both PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III induce myocyte hypertrophy via discrete signaling pathways. Although both agonists signal via the JNK pathway to initiate changes in c-Jun-dependent gene transcription, PGF2αpreferentially activates the MEK-Erk2- cytosolic phospholipase A2 pathway. In contrast, the PI3K-p70S6Kpathway appears to be essential for 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III-induced myocyte hypertrophy.

The actions of PGF2α are thought to be mediated via the PGF2α receptor (FP), which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily (1Abramovitz M. Boie Y. Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H.

PGF2αhas diverse physiological actions, ranging from being a potent luteolytic agent (2McCracken J.A. Glew M.E. Scaramuzzi R.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1970; 30: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) to causing vascular smooth muscle contraction (3Csepli J. Csapo A.I.

Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) has recently been shown to stimulate hypertrophy of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and to induce the expression of myofibrillar genes, independent of muscle contraction (8Adams J.W .

Physiol. 1996; 271: H2197-H2208PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that ventricular myocytes enlarge and produce ANF in response to PGF2α and its analog, fluprostenol, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, chronic administration of fluprostenol resulted in an increase in cardiac growth (heart weight- and ventricular weight-to-body weight ratios) in vivo (9Lai J. Jin H. Yang R. Weiner J.

Although the actions of PGF2α on cardiomyocytes suggest important roles for this eicosanoid in development, compensatory hypertrophy, and recovery of the heart from injury, the molecular mechanisms of PGF2α-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy remain largely unknown. F2 isoprostanes (iPs) are PGF2α isomers that are generated by free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid (10Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). We have performed total stereospecific synthesis of several iPs, including 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III (previously known as 12-iso-PGF2α) (11Hwang S.W. Adiyaman M. Khanapure S.P. Rokach J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 779-782Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and iPF2α-VI (previously known as IPF2α-I) (12Adiyaman M. Lawson J.A. Hwang S.W. Khanapure S.P. FitzGerald G.A. Rokach J. Tetahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 4849-4852Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and have recently demonstrated that the iP, 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III, may activate FP in a specific and saturable manner (13Kunapuli P. Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27147-27154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The iP, 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III is a member of the group III isoprostanes, which also includes 8-iso-iPF2α-III. Group III iPs are derived originally from 11-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid. The 8-iso- and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III are identical in every respect with PGF2α except for the stereochemistry of the side chains at C-8 and C-12. We and others (14Fukunaga M. Takahashi K. Badr K.F.

Thus, incidental prostaglandin membrane receptor activation by iPs may complement the actions of eicosanoids in clinical syndromes where oxidant stress and augmented prostaglandin biosynthesis coincide (17Delanty N.

Shortly after birth, however, cardiac myocytes lose their capacity for mitogenesis, and further growth of the myocardium occurs by enlargement of the existing cardiomyocytes (hypertrophy) (20Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Cardiac hypertrophy enables the heart to adapt to demands for increased cardiac output and to injury and is characterized by an increase in protein content of the individual cardiomyocytes (21Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The neonatal rat ventricular myocyte culture has been developed to mimic many features of the hypertrophic response in vivo, including an increase in cell size and protein content, activation of immediate early genes, and activation of embryonic genes, such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (20Chien K.R.

Res. 1993; 73: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar) have been shown to induce GPCR-mediated activation and thereby phosphorylation of different intracellular signaling intermediates, resulting in myocyte hypertrophy. Stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-AR) in ventricular myocytes triggers an increase in cell size, organization of myofilaments into sarcomeric units, and transcriptional activation of ANF. It is well established that Ras-dependent pathways involving Raf, MEK, and Erks are involved in α1-AR-mediated hypertrophy in vivoand in vitro (26Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.Y. Powers S.

Activation of c-Jun culminates in increased ANF gene transcription. In this report, we establish for the first time that the biological action of an F2 isoprostane, 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III, is similar in potency to that of the cognate prostaglandin ligand, PGF2α. However, despite apparently activating the same membrane receptor, PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III induce ventricular myocyte hypertrophy by preferentially activating different intracellular signaling pathways.

Neonatal ventricular myocytes were cultured from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described by Simpson and Savion (30Simpson P. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-mm cubes of ventricles were placed in ice-cold dissociation buffer, pH 7.5 (137 mm NaCl, 5.36 mm KCl, 0.81 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 5.55 mm dextrose, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.34 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 20 mmHEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin), containing 0.1% trypsin and 0.002% DNase. After mechanical dissociation of the tissue by several rounds of alternate gently pipetting and centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, cells were preplated for 30 min in minimum Eagle's medium with 5% calf serum at 37 °C to enhance the attachment of nonmyocytes, leaving the myocytes in suspension. An aliquot of the non-attached cells was counted in a hemocytometer in quadruplicate with 0.4% trypan blue to exclude dead cells. Nonmyocytes in the myocyte culture were limited to <10% of the total cell number by inclusion of 0.1 mmbromodeoxyuridine in the culture medium for 6–8 h. Myocytes were then plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum and antibiotics at a density of 500 cells per mm2 and maintained overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Myocytes in 12-well dishes were serum-starved for 24 h and then labeled to equilibrium with myo-[2-3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) for 16–24 h in serum-free DMEM containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.5% Albumax. Cells were preincubated with 20 mm LiCl for 15 min at 37 °C and then stimulated by addition of agonist for 10 min at 37 °C. Total inositol phosphates were measured as described previously (31Seuwen K. Lagarde A. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, InsP formation was stopped by aspiration of the medium. Formic acid (0.75 ml of 10 mm solution per well) was added, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The solution containing the extracted InsP was neutralized and diluted with 3 ml of 5 mm NH4OH (yielding a final pH of 8–9) and then applied directly to a column containing 0.7 ml of the anion exchange resin, AG-1-X8. The column was washed with 4 ml of 40 mmammonium formate, pH 5.0, and the total InsPs was eluted with 4 ml of 2m ammonium formate, pH 5.0. One ml of the eluate was counted in 9 ml of scintillant. Results presented are the mean ± S.E. of 4 independent experiments performed in duplicate. [3H]Phenylalanine incorporation was determined to estimate the relative rates of protein synthesis as described (8Adams J.W . Migita D.S. Yu M.K. Young R. Hellickson M.S. Castro-Vargas F.E.

Briefly, myocytes in 12-well dishes were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated in serum-free DMEM with agonist (or vehicle, as control) for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 0.36 mml-phenylalanine and 5 μCi/mll-[2,3,4,5,6-3H]phenylalanine during the last 4 h of stimulation. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. Cell precipitates were then washed twice with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 1% SDS (1 ml/well) at 37 °C for 1 h. The SDS-soluble protein was counted in 9 ml of scintillant. Results presented are the mean ± S.E. of 4–6 independent experiments performed in duplicate. Total protein content of myocytes was measured as described (9Lai J. Jin H. Yang R. Weiner J. Li W. Yen R. King K.L. Zeigler F. Ko A. Cheng J. Bunting S. Paoni N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2197-H2208PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated as described above and stimulated with agonist in serum-free DMEM for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and 100 μl of trypsin/EDTA was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C until the cells had rounded. A solution of 5% fetal calf serum in PBS was added to each well to stop the reaction. The cells were harvested, washed by centrifugation, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and the cell number was determined. SDS was added to a final of concentration of 1%, and the cell suspension was vortexed and incubated at 4 °C overnight. This mixture was then warmed to 37 °C, and protein concentration was determined using the Pierce Micro BCA kit. Protein contents were normalized to the cell count. Results presented are the mean ± S.E of four independent experiments performed in triplicate. Cells were plated, starved, and stimulated with agonist for 24 h at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM as described above to measure ANF formation by myocytes. The culture supernatant was used to assay for ANF by RIA according to manufacturer's instructions. Results presented are the mean ± S.E. of 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis of ANF under conditions of additive hypertrophy was performed with Student's unpaired t test (p < 0.01). Myocytes were plated and starved as described above. Cells were pretreated with 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 10 μm PGF2α or 8,12-iso-iPF2a-III for 10 min at 37 °C to quantitate the accumulation of intracellular cAMP. Cells were stimulated with 10 μm forskolin and 100 μmagonist for 10 min at 37 °C following pretreatment with isobutylmethylxanthine to analyze the effects of PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III on inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. Reactions were terminated by aspiration, and cAMP was extracted with ice-cold 65% ethanol for 30 min. Samples were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in assay buffer, and cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay (n = 3), according to manufacturer's instructions. Myocytes were fractionated into membrane and cytosolic fractions essentially as described earlier (32Hoshijima M. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7725-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Myocytes in 100-mm plates were serum-starved as described above. Cells were stimulated with vehicle (control), 1 μm PGF2α, or 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mmNa2P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 500 μm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) by shearing 10 times through a 25-gauge needle. Unbroken cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to a high speed centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet (P) was designated the membrane fraction, and the supernatant (S) was designated the cytosolic fraction. The protein content of the membrane and pellet fractions were analyzed by Pierce Micro BCA kit. For immunocytochemistry of cPLA2, myocytes were plated on chamber slides (Nunc, Napierville, IL), stimulated with vehicle (control) or 10 μm agonist for 5 min at 37 °C, and fixed with 70% methanol, 30% acetone at −20 °C for 10 min followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min. The cells were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS and then treated with 1:25 dilution of the monoclonal human cPLA2 antibody in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS at room temperature. Between each step, cells were washed three times for 10 min with PBS. Slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined by fluorescence confocal microscopy. The amount of 6 keto-PGF1α in the myocyte culture medium upon stimulation with vehicle (control), 10 μm PGF2α, or 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III (2 min at 37 °C) was analyzed by GC/MS as a measure of cPLA2 activity. Briefly, 1 ng of 3,3,4,4-d4–6-keto-PGF1α was added to 1 ml of the culture medium. After 15 min at room temperature, 150 μl of methoxyamine HCl in water (0.8 mg/μl solution) was added, and the pH was lowered to 2.5–3.0 with formic acid. The sample was loaded on a solid phase extraction cartridge (C18 EC, 100 mg; International Sorbent Technology, Mid Glamorgan, UK) preconditioned with 0.5 ml of ethanol followed by 3 ml of water at 1 ml/min using a Rapid Trace SPE workstation (Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA). The cartridge was washed with 1 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 1 ml/min followed by 1 ml of 25% ethanol at 1 ml/min, 3 × 5 ml of hexane at 15 ml/min and 3 × 5 ml of air at 30 ml/min. The sample was eluted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate at 1 ml/min and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine, 10 μl and 10% pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile were added to the sample, which was allowed to stand for 10 min and dried under N2. The sample was then dissolved in 25 μl of methanol, applied to a TLC plate (LK6D; Whatman), and developed with 2% methanol in ethyl acetate. A separate plate loaded with 2 μg of 2,3-dinor thromboxane/methoxime/pentafluorobenzyl ester was simultaneously developed. The standard plate was dried and dipped in 8% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in 0.3 m cupric sulfate and heated on a hot plate to visualize the standard. The sample plates, 6-mm zones, were scraped 2 mm lower than the standard, and the scrapings were extracted from 100 μl of water with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. Piridine and bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), 10 μl each were added to the sample, which was allowed to stand for 10 min and dried under nitrogen. The sample was dissolved in 20 μl of bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide in dodecane for GC/MS analysis on an MD-800 mass spectrometer (Finnigan Corp., San Jose, CA) interfaced with a GC-8000 gas chromatograph and an AS-800 autosampler. The solvents were purchased from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). A 30-m DB5-MS (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) GC column was used with helium as the carrier gas. The temperature program consisted of an initial temperature of 190 °C for 1 min followed by a programmed increase to 320 °C at 20 °C/min. The MS was operated in the negative ion (electron capture) chemical ionization mode, using ammonia as the moderating gas. The ions monitored were m/z614.4 for the endogenous 6- keto-PGF1α methoxyime pentafluorobenzyl ester trimethylsilylether derivative andm/z 618.4 for the internal standard. Results presented are the mean ± S.E. of 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's unpairedt test (p < 0.005). Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and starved as described above. Cells were stimulated with 10 μm PGF2α or 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III for the indicated times at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were stimulated with 50 nm PGF2α and 200 nm8,12-iso-iPF2α-III for the indicated times at 37 °C. When the effects of protein kinase inhibitors were analyzed, the cells were preincubated with the indicated concentration of the inhibitor at 37 °C for 15 min and then stimulated with agonist. The medium was quickly aspirated; cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by Pierce Micro BCA kit, and 30–50 μg of total protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose blots. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with various phospho-specific antibodies according to manufacturer's instructions. The blots were washed 6 times with TBS-T and probed with a 1:2000 to a 1:5000 dilution of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for one hour at room temperature. Antigen-antibody complexes were then visualized by chemiluminescence. Results presented are representative of 3–4 experiments.

Stimulation of ventricular myocytes with 10 μm PGF2α or 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III for 24 h induces myocyte hypertrophy, comparable to that stimulated by phenylephrine (Fig. 1, TableI). In contrast, the thromboxane receptor agonist, U46619, or the iPs, 8-iso-iPF2α-III or iPF2α-VI have no significant effect (Table I).Table IAgonist-induced myocyte hypertrophyAgonist (10 μm)Hypertrophy% control unstimulated cellsPhenylephrine188 ± 18PGF2α218 ± 22U46619117 ± 118,12-iso-iPF2α-III185 ± 158-iso-iPF2α-III123 ± 19iPF2α-VI119 ± 13Myocytes were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with 10 μm concentration of various agonists in serum-free DMEM for 24 h at 37 °C.

The relative rates of protein synthesis were analyzed by [3H]phenylalanine incorporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III induce ventricular myocyte hypertrophy, as measured by the rate of protein synthesis, in a dose-dependent and saturable manner (Fig.2 A).

Both PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in total protein content of ventricular myocytes within 24 h (Fig. 2 B), with EC50 values of 10 ± 2.8 and 200 ± 30 nm, respectively (p < 0.005). Furthermore, both agonists stimulated a significant dose-dependent increase in ANF formation (Fig. 2 C), another hallmark of myocyte hypertrophy, with EC50 values of 8 ± 2.1 and 500 ± 120 nm for PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III, respectively (p < 0.005). Thus, the two agonists, PGF2α and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-III, appear to have distinct although overlapping potencies for causing myocyte hypertrophy. Inte"
https://openalex.org/W2057708960,"Quinolone binding to the gyrase-DNA complex induces a conformational change that results in the blocking of supercoiling. Under these conditions gyrase is still capable of ATP hydrolysis which now proceeds through an alternative pathway involving two different conformations of the enzyme (Kampranis, S. C., and Maxwell, A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22606–22614). The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis via this pathway have been studied and found to differ from those of the reaction of the drug-free enzyme. The quinolone-characteristic ATPase rate is DNA-dependent and can be induced in the presence of DNA fragments as small as 20 base pairs. By observing the conversion of the ATPase rate to the quinolone characteristic rate, the formation and dissociation of the gyrase-DNA-quinolone complex can be monitored. Comparison of the time dependence of the conversion of the gyrase ATPase with that of DNA cleavage reveals that formation of the gyrase-DNA-quinolone complex does not correspond to the formation of cleaved DNA. Quinolone-induced DNA cleavage proceeds via a mechanism consisting of two cleavage events that is modulated in the presence of a nucleotide cofactor. We demonstrate that quinolone binding and drug-induced DNA cleavage are separate processes constituting two sequential steps in the mechanism of action of quinolones on DNA gyrase.

We demonstrate that quinolone binding and drug-induced DNA cleavage are separate processes constituting two sequential steps in the mechanism of action of quinolones on DNA gyrase. DNA gyrase is the intracellular target of the quinolone group of antibacterial agents. The addition of quinolone drugs to an in vitro reaction containing DNA gyrase, relaxed closed-circular DNA, and ATP leads to the inhibition of supercoiling (2Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T.

Quinolones also inhibit the relaxation, catenation, and decatenation reactions of gyrase (2Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The molecular details of the interaction of the drugs with the gyrase-DNA complex are unknown. When the binding of the drugs to the enzyme was investigated, insignificant binding of quinolones to the A or B subunit (GyrB) or to the gyrase holoenzyme (A2B2) was detected (5Shen L.L. Kohlbrenner W.E. Weigl D. Baranowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2973-2978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Willmott C.J.R. Maxwell A. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Binding of the drugs to the DNA is weak, and more efficient in the case of single- compared with double-stranded DNA (8Shen L.L. Pernet A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 9Shen L.L. Baranowski J. Pernet A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3879-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Quinolones were found to bind strongly to the complex formed by gyrase and DNA, and ATP appeared to assist this interaction (5Shen L.L. Kohlbrenner W.E. Weigl D. Baranowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2973-2978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results led to the proposal that the drugs bind to the single-stranded DNA region that is revealed when gyrase cleaves DNA during turnover (10Shen L.L. Mitscher L.A. Sharma P.D. O'Donnell T.J. Chu D.T.W. Cooper C.S. Rosen T. Pernet A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3886-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This proposal was addressed by site-directed mutagenesis of the gyrase active site. Mutation of tyrosine 122 to serine or phenylalanine abolished supercoiling and quinolone-induced DNA cleavage but the mutants could still bind the drugs equally well as wild-type (11Critchlow S.E. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7387-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Clearly DNA cleavage is not required for drug binding. Similar results have also been obtained with topoisomerase IV (12Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Using limited proteolysis we found that quinolones stabilize a conformational change in the gyrase-DNA complex (1Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 268: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar). DNA cleavage is not required for the enzyme to undergo this conformational change since a mutant that binds quinolones but cannot cleave DNA gives the same proteolytic fingerprints in the presence of the drugs as the wild-type enzyme. We suggested that this quinolone-stabilized conformation is responsible for the inhibition of the gyrase functions. At the molecular level this conformation was interpreted as a state of the enzyme where the DNA gate is trapped in the closed form irrespective of the DNA cleavage-religation state. ATP hydrolysis could still occur when gyrase was in the quinolone-trapped state but the complex exhibited a rate of hydrolysis that was lower than that of the drug-free enzyme. In order to shed more light on the interaction of quinolones with gyrase we have studied the characteristics of ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme-drug complex. We show that the rate of ATP hydrolysis can provide a sensitive tool for monitoring of the formation of the gyrase-quinolone complex and we use this tool to probe the relationship between drug binding and drug-induced DNA cleavage. GyrA, GyrB, and the 59-kDa domain of GyrA (GyrA59, gift of C. Smith) were purified as described previously (13Maxwell A. Howells A.J. Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N. Protocols for DNA Topoisomerases I: DNA Topology and Enzyme Purification. Humana Press, 1998: 135-144Google Scholar,14Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3540-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negatively supercoiled and relaxed forms of plasmid pBR322 were provided by A. J. Howells (University of Leicester). Linear pBR322 was prepared by digestion of the supercoiled form withEcoRI. The 198-bp fragment was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using pBS147 as a template (15Orphanides G. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The 147-, 90-, and 80-bp fragments containing the major gyrase cleavage site of plasmid pBR322 (16Dobbs S.T. Cullis P.M. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3567-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using pBR322 as a template. The 40- and 20-bp fragments, based on the same pBR322 site, were prepared by the annealing of complementary chemically synthesized oligonucleotides that had been purified by high performance liquid chromatography (PNACL, University of Leicester). ATPase assays were performed as described previously (17Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 18Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32696-32703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DNA supercoiling and quinolone-induced cleavage reactions were carried out under the conditions previously described (19Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19648-19653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In DNA cleavage assays, 10 nm relaxed pBR322 was incubated with 18 nm GyrA, 54 nm GyrB (giving a final concentration of A2B2 of 9 nm), and the indicated concentrations of ciprofloxacin (CFX) at 25 °C for the times shown. Cleavage was revealed by addition of 0.2% SDS and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K and incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The results were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, containing 3 μg/ml chloroquine where indicated, and the cleavage was quantified by analysis of the captured image with the program ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). In the preceding paper (1Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 268: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we described the formation of two different complexes in the presence of quinolones and suggested that the drug-inhibited enzyme can hydrolyze ATP by undergoing a different catalytic cycle entailing these two complexes. To provide further support for the existence of this alternative pathway, we have analyzed the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of the drugs (Fig. 1). The interaction of gyrase with ATP leading to nucleotide hydrolysis is far from simple, and it has been shown that the Michaelis-Menten paradigm cannot describe sufficiently the experimental data obtained (20Maxwell A. Rau D.C. Gellert M. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Biomolecular Stereodynamics III: Proceedings of the Fourth Conversation in the Discipline of Biomolecular Stereodynamics, June 4–9, 1985, Albany, NY.

This is mainly due to the presence of two binding sites for ATP and the requirement for B subunit dimerization in order for nucleotide hydrolysis to take place (17Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A more comprehensive model describing the ATP hydrolysis by DNA gyrase is shown below,E+ATP↔Kd1E·ATP+ATP↔Kd2E·ATP2→k3E+2ADP+2PiEquation 1 There is presently no experimental evidence for ATP hydrolysis taking place when the nucleotide is bound to only one of the two ATP-binding sites. Moreover, when the A2B2tetramer was reconstituted with a mixture of wild-type GyrB and a mutant that cannot bind the nucleotide it was found that both GyrB subunits must be functional in nucleotide binding in order for catalytic supercoiling to occur (22O'Dea M.H. Tamura J.K. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9723-9729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this mechanism we assume that both ATP-binding sites have to be filled before hydrolysis can take place. The steady-state equation describing this interaction is shown in the “Appendix.” In Equation 1,k3 reflects the apparent rate constant of the ATP hydrolysis/product release step of the mechanism. Because of the experimental setup used in these experiments these two steps are indistinguishable. Our assay measures changes in ADP concentration and therefore the rate of hydrolysis measured depends on the rate by which ADP is released from the complex. By fitting the data in Fig. 1 to Equation 17, we obtained values of k3 of 0.56 ± 0.03 s−1 in the absence of CFX and 0.27 ± 0.04 s−1 in the presence of the drug, i.e.the final step of the ATPase mechanism is inhibited by the drugs by a factor of ∼2. The first steps of the ATPase mechanism, namely the two successive nucleotide binding steps, are represented in this model by the equilibrium dissociation constantsKd1 andKd2, respectively. The interaction of ATP with the two binding sites in the drug-free complex appears to exhibit positive cooperativity with Kd2being approximately 1 order of magnitude lower thanKd1. The values of these constants were estimated to be Kd1 ∼ 590 μm and Kd2 ∼ 70 μm. The gyrase-drug complex exhibits a similar equilibrium dissociation constant for the first step,Kd1 ∼ 530 μm, but the second step has a Kd2 of ∼260 μm; it seems that cooperativity between the two ATP sites is significantly reduced in the presence of quinolones. The dependence of the quinolone-characteristic ATPase rate on DNA concentration was investigated. A2B2 and the version of gyrase that has been deleted for the 33-kDa domains, A592B2, were incubated with increasing concentrations of linear pBR322 and the ATPase rate in the presence of CFX was measured (Fig. 2). Drug-free gyrase showed the well documented increase in the rate of hydrolysis with increasing DNA concentrations (23Maxwell A. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14472-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A592B2was unable to show any increased ATPase in the absence of CFX in the range of DNA concentrations used in these experiments. This characteristic of A592B2 has been seen previously and was attributed to the weak DNA binding of this enzyme (∼10-fold weaker than A2B2 (24Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)). In the presence of the drug, the ATPase activity of A2B2 exhibited a steep dependence on DNA concentration at low DNA:enzyme ratios and reached a plateau after ∼200 bp:enzyme. The plateau rate was ∼0.63 s−1. As described previously (1Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 268: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar), when incubated with quinolones and DNA, A592B2 exhibits a rate of hydrolysis similar to that of the drug-bound full-length enzyme-DNA complex. The dependence of this rate on DNA concentration is not as steep as in the case of A2B2. At the DNA concentrations used in this experiment the A592B2-DNA-CFX rate seemed to reach a plateau value which approaches the maximum A2B2-DNA-quinolone rate. We investigated the effect of DNA length on the quinolone rate. Fragments in the range 20–198 bp based on the preferred cleavage site of pBR322 were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Large DNA fragments, such as the 198- and 147-bp fragment, when incubated with A2B2 and CFX, showed the quinolone characteristic rate at stoichiometric ratios of enzyme:DNA (Fig. 3 A). In the case of smaller size fragments, such as a 90-mer or a 80-mer, higher concentrations of DNA were required for reaching the maximum rate. We found that DNA fragments as short as 20 bp are sufficient for inducing the quinolone-characteristic rate (Fig. 3 B). The ability of short fragments to form the enzyme-DNA-quinolone complex was observed for both A2B2 and the truncated form A592B2 (Fig. 3 B). Again the concentration of 20-mer or 40-mer required for reaching the maximum quinolone rate was higher than stoichiometric. DNA gyrase and linear pBR322 were incubated with increasing concentrations of CFX (1 nm to 10 μm) and the ATPase rate was measured. The rate of hydrolysis was reduced from 0.98 s−1 in the absence of CFX to 0.6 s−1 at the highest drug concentration (Fig.4 A). We fitted these data to a rectangular hyperbola (see Equation 29 in the “Appendix”) and estimated the inhibitory effect of CFX. An inhibition constant (Kiq) was defined as the drug concentration at which half-maximal conversion to the quinolone rate occurs. This constant was measured to beKiq = 31 ± 5 nm. 2The gyrase concentration present in this determination (20 nm) is too close to the measured value ofKiq, and at low CFX concentrations the concentration of added drug would not be equal to the concentration of free drug in solution. For this, the above results are better interpreted using Equation 34 which takes into account this effect (see “Appendix”). Analysis of the above data with Equation 34 yielded a value of kiq = 8.4 ± 1.3 nm. As seen before, A592B2 does not have a DNA-dependent ATPase activity, while in the presence of quinolones it exhibits the quinolone characteristic rate. When the same experiment was performed with the A592B2complex the rate increased with increasing concentrations of drug (Fig.4 A, inset). The quinolone-induced rate reached a maximum at ∼0.5 s−1. The A592B2-DNA-quinolone complex appeared to be significantly less stable than the respective A2B2 complex requiring much higher concentrations of the drug for its formation. The inhibition constant for this complex was determined to beKiq = 36 ± 8 μm. As seen previously, the impaired affinity of short DNA fragments for gyrase requires higher DNA concentrations for the formation of the complex. We reported earlier that the affinity of A592B2 for DNA is approximately 10 times lower than the A2B2 complex (24Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, the result obtained with A592B2 is likely to be a manifestation of the weaker stability of the A592B2-DNA complex. We studied the dissociation of quinolones from the enzyme-drug complex. The gyrase-DNA-quinolone complex was formed and the enzyme-DNA complexes were separated from the free drug by gel filtration through a spin column. The enzyme complex was then introduced into an ATPase reaction and the rate was monitored. Under these conditions the rate of ATP hydrolysis reverted from the quinolone rate to the drug-free one. The rate of hydrolysis was plotted against time and this plot was used to estimate the dissociation rate constant of the drug from the complex (Fig. 4 B). The apparent dissociation rate constant was measured to be koffobs = 3 × 10−4 s−1. As we will discuss later, the interaction of quinolones with gyrase appears to involve a number of different steps. Therefore, koffobs is an observed dissociation rate constant representing the overall dissociation process. The value of koffobsdetermined by this method represents a lower limit in the apparent dissociation rate since the drug was not fully removed from the reaction after it had dissociated from the complex. Rebinding would result in a slower apparent dissociation phase. We examined the time dependence of the appearance of the quinolone-characteristic ATPase rate. With large fragments (198 and 147 bp) or pBR322 DNA the interaction between the enzyme-DNA complex and the drugs was completed quickly after the addition of the drug so no change in the ATPase rate could be observed (data not shown). When we studied the time dependence of the interaction of gyrase with a 40-mer we found that the appearance of the quinolone characteristic rate was a slow process (Fig. 5). Similar results were found for a 20-bp fragment. This phenomenon was common for both A2B2 and A592B2 and the appearance of the quinolone rate showed the same time dependence for both complexes (data not shown). We measured the rate of ATP hydrolysis over a period of 3 h and plotted the values against time (Fig. 5). From this plot we could estimate the apparent rate of the formation of the enzyme-drug complex by fitting to a simple exponential. The half-life of the conversion to the quinolone complex was ∼20 min at 300 nm 40-mer and 20 nmA592B2. When the concentration of the 40-bp fragment was varied (50–300 nm) the apparent rate of complex formation increased with DNA concentration (Fig. 5). However, the relationship between rate of complex formation and DNA concentration was not linear. A 3-fold increase in DNA concentration, from 100 to 300 nm, resulted only in 50% increase in the rate of complex formation, from 4 × 10−4s−1 to 6 × 10−4 s−1. We investigated the time dependence of the conversion to the quinolone ATPase rate and that of drug-induced DNA cleavage using linear or negatively supercoiled pBR322 as substrate and concentrations of CFX in the range 50 nm to 15 μm. Conversion to the quinolone characteristic rate was always immediate. Even at the lowest concentration of CFX used (50 nm) no evidence for a slow conversion of the ATPase rate was apparent. By contrast, when the time dependence of DNA cleavage was studied, the formation of the cleaved complex was very slow (data not shown). Similar experiments with gyrase and enoxacin also suggested that the formation of the cleaved complex is slow (25Scheirer K.E. Higgins N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27202-27209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The rate of quinolone-directed cleavage increased with drug concentration but the slow formation of the product was clearly observable throughout the range of drug concentration used (up to 15 μm). We set out to test the slow formation of the cleaved complex using relaxed DNA as substrate and substoichiometric ratios of enzyme to DNA (enzyme:DNA = 0.9). Under these conditions, on average less than one cleavage event is expected per plasmid. Therefore substrate linearization can be viewed as the measure of double-stranded DNA cleavage. Using relaxed DNA as substrate presents distinct advantages. First, gyrase would bind almost equally well to all the topological isomers present, unlike the case of supercoiled DNA where binding to the nicked species would be favored (investigation of the reaction using negatively supercoiled DNA would require high purity nick-free DNA); preferential binding would result in more than one cleavage event per DNA molecule. Second, using relaxed DNA the time dependence of the inhibition of supercoiling could be followed. Fig. 6 A shows the formation of the cleaved complex at 5 μm CFX in the absence of nucleotide cofactor (note that the gel contains chloroquine, so that the relaxed DNA runs as positively supercoiled and is thus resolved from the nicked band). The slow appearance of the linear form is clearly evident. Under these conditions, the intensity of the open circular band increases in the first stages of the reaction, reaches a maximum after 15 min, and then decreases to return back to a level similar to that in the beginning of the reaction. Control experiments carried out in the absence of either the drug or the enzyme showed that this phenomenon was caused by the enzyme-drug complex. Singly nicked DNA could be produced by the gyrase-quinolone complex if cleavage occurred only in one of the two DNA strands. Accumulation of the singly nicked species in the early stages of the cleavage reaction suggests that this is an intermediate in the cleavage reaction. The amount of the singly and doubly nicked products was quantified and plotted against time (Fig. 6 B). The plot is typical of a reaction proceeding through an intermediate product. We can describe the cleavage reaction using the following simple scheme,Closed circular DNA→k1singly nicked DNA→k2doubly nicked DNAEquation 2 where k1 and k2 are the apparent rate constants for the formation of the singly and doubly nicked DNA products, respectively. As seen in Fig. 6 A only a small population of enzyme-DNA complexes was in the cleaved state at the end of the reaction. The concentration of each of these species at any time is described by the following equations,[ccDNA]=[ccDNA]0e−k1tEquation 3 [snDNA]=[ccDNA]0k1k2−k1(e−k1t−e−k2t)Equation 4 [dnDNA]=[ccDNA]01−k2e−k1t−k1e−k2tk2−k1Equation 5 [snDNA]+[dnDNA]=[ccDNA]0(1−e−k1t)Equation 6 The abbreviations ccDNA, snDNA, and dnDNA represent the closed circular, singly nicked, and doubly nicked forms of DNA described in Equation 2. [ccDNA]0 is the concentration of the cleavage-proficient gyrase-quinolone complexes at the beginning of the reaction. By fitting the data obtained to the above kinetic model we were able to determine the values of the two apparent rate constants. The apparent rate constant for the first cleavage event was readily measured from Equation 6 to be k1 = 1.6 ± 0.1 × 10−3 s−1. However, the apparent rate constant for the second step could not be uniquely defined whenk1 was fixed at the above value. For this reason, the interaction was simulated using the program KFitSim (D. Thomas and N. Millar) and the value of k2 giving the best fit was determined to be ∼1.9 × 10−3s−1. We studied the cleavage reaction in the presence of ATP (Fig.6 C). In this experiment the fast binding and inhibition of gyrase by the drugs was clearly evident; the strand-passage reaction was blocked immediately after addition of the drug and no supercoiling was observed (data not shown). DNA cleavage was again slow and proceeded via a singly nicked intermediate as seen previously. The relative amounts of the three DNA species were quantified and the apparent rate constants for the two cleavage steps were determined. The cleavage reaction in the presence of ATP was faster than in the absence of the nucleotide. At 5 μm CFX the values of the rate constants for the two cleavage steps were k1 = 2.2 ± 0.5 × 10−3 s−1 andk2 ∼4.2 × 10−3s−1. These rates are faster than those observed in the absence of nucleotide at the same drug concentration (Fig. 6,A and B) suggesting that the presence of the nucleotide increases the rate of the reaction. We examined the cleavage reaction in the presence of ATP over a range of drug concentrations. It was found that the rate of cleavage increased with quinolone concentration. Values for k1 were determined to be 2.5 ± 0.8 and 3.8 ± 0.5 × 10−3s−1 at 10 and 15 μm CFX, respectively, whilek2 increased to ∼5.3 and ∼7.1 × 10−3 s−1 at these drug concentrations. A similar investigation was carried out in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, ADPNP. The two steps of the cleavage reaction were again apparent in the presence of the nucleotide analogue (Fig. 6 D). The rate constants representing the two cleavage steps were also dependent on drug concentration and at 0.5 μm CFX were determined to bek1 = 7.5 ± 0.5 × 10−4s−1 and k2 ∼ 3.2 × 10−3 s−1. Using limited proteolysis we identified two conformational states of DNA gyrase in the presence of quinolone drugs (complex III and complex IV) and suggested that ATP hydrolysis in this case proceeds through an alternative pathway involving complexes III and IV (1Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 268: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have now investigated the kinetic characteristics of hydrolysis by the drug-bound complex, which can be described by Equation 1. Essentially the two nucleotide-binding steps are represented by the respective equilibrium dissociation constants, Kd1 andKd2, and the hydrolysis/product release step with the apparent first-order rate constantk3. Drug binding reduces the rate of the overall hydrolysis step (k3) by a factor of ∼2. The equilibrium dissociation constants determined by this method should be treated as estimates as the data are inadequate to uniquely define these values. Nevertheless, the results suggest that the two successive nucleotide binding steps exhibit positive cooperativity. By contrast, in the case of the drug-bound enzyme, cooperativity seems to be less pronounced. This effect can be rationalized on the basis of the conformational change induced by the drug. For cooperativity to take place a mechanism of allosteric interaction must operate between the two GyrB proteins. As the conformational change observed by proteolysis has its major effect on the C-terminal domain of GyrB (1Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 268: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it is not difficult to imagine how such a change in protein conformation could affect allosteric communication between the two subunits. We studied the DNA dependence of the formation of the gyrase-DNA-quinolone complex by looking at the conversion of the ATPase rate. The formation of the complex was very efficient at low DNA concentrations and reached a plateau when the DNA to enzyme ratio exceeded 200 bp per gyrase molecule. The footprint of gyrase is ∼130 bp (15Orphanides G. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, two enzyme molecules that are bound at sites that are separated by a stretch of DNA smaller than the footprint of the protein exclude this part of the DNA from being bound, so that the effective length of DNA occupied by a DNA-binding protein is much larger than its footprint (26McGhee J.D. von Hippel P. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). Therefore, the “critical” concentration of ∼200 bp per enzyme, for the drug-bound complex, represents here the minimum amount of DNA required for all the gyrase molecule"

We report here on the identification of semaphorin K1 (sema K1), the first semaphorin known to be associated with cell surfaces via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage. Sema K1 is highly homologous to a viral semaphorin and can interact with specific immune cells, suggesting that like its viral counterpart, sema K1 could play an important role in regulating immune function. Sema K1 does not bind to neuropilin-1 or neuropilin-2, the two receptors implicated in mediating the repulsive action of several secreted semaphorins, and thus it likely acts through a novel receptor. In contrast to most previously described semaphorins, sema K1 is only weakly expressed during development but is present at high levels in postnatal and adult tissues, particularly brain and spinal cord.

The semaphorins constitute a large family of evolutionally conserved glycoproteins that are defined by a characteristic semaphorin domain of approximately 500 amino acids (1Kolodkin A.L. Matthes D.J.

The first vertebrate semaphorin, collapsin-1 in chick, was identified by its ability to induce growth cone collapse (4Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Consistent with this function, its mammalian homologue, sema III, has been shown to repel specific subsets of sensory axons (5Messersmith E.-K. Leonardo E.-D. Shatz C.-J. Tessier-Lavigne M.

The vertebrate semaphorin family can be classified into several phylogenetically distinct subfamilies (Ref. 15Adams R.-H. Betz H. Puschel A.-W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Fig. 1 B). Each subfamily has a unique structural arrangement of protein domains. The secreted members of the semaphorin family contain a characteristic semaphorin domain at the NH2 terminus, followed by an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and a stretch of basic amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal region. Between the NH2-terminal semaphorin domain and the transmembrane spanning region, the transmembrane semaphorins contain several alternative structural motifs, including either an Ig domain, a stretch of thrombospondin repeats, or a sequence with no obvious domain homology. Interestingly, semaphorin-like sequences have been identified in the genomes of poxviruses (1Kolodkin A.L. Matthes D.J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (28Ensser A. Fleckenstein B. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These virally encoded semaphorins occupy unique branches of the semaphorin phylogenetic tree. Although it has been suggested that these viral semaphorins must have vertebrate homologues, to date none have been reported.

Four human ESTs, R33537, W47265, R33439,H03806, and one mouse EST, AA260340, were identified that show highest homology with the semaphorin gene in alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AHV sema). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences of human ESTs were used to amplify by PCR a cDNA fragment from a human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH). This PCR fragment corresponds to the central portion of sema K1. The 3′ end was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using human placenta Marathon-Ready cDNA from CLONTECH (29Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The remaining 5′ end was cloned by PCR amplification from aCLONTECH human brain λgt11 cDNA library using an internal primer from sema K1 and an anchor primer corresponding to the λgt11 vector sequence. A specific PCR product corresponding to the 5′ end was identified by Southern blot using sema K1 oligonucleotides as probes. Repeated effort has been made, but failed to yield the remaining 5′ end of cDNA. The full-length cDNA of human sema K1 except the region corresponding to the signal peptide sequence was independently cloned from CLONTECHhuman placenta λgt10 library by high fidelity PCR amplification and its DNA sequence reconfirmed. Three expression constructs were made that allow the expression of recombinant proteins tagged with either a Myc-His tag at the carboxyl terminus (pEX-mh), an alkaline phosphatase tag at the amino terminus and a Myc-His tag at the carboxyl terminus (pEX-AP), or an Fc domain of human immunoglobulin at the carboxyl terminus (pEX-Fc). Similar expression constructs have been made for collapsins and semaphorins, and the resulting fusion proteins were shown to be fully functional (7Kobayashi H. Koppel A.-M. Luo Y. Raper J.-A. J.

The multiple cloning site of pSecTagA (Invitrogen) was excised with PmeI and NheI and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to make Myc-His tagged vector pEX-mh. This expression vector contains a signal peptide sequence from immunoglobulin κ chain for protein secretion. The cDNA for human placental alkaline phosphatase was PCR-amplified from pSEAP (CLONTECH) and cloned into theSfiI site of pEX-mh maintaining the original reading frame to make the AP-tagged vector pEX-AP. The Fc domain of human IgG1 and an enterokinase cleavage site were PCR-amplified from Signal-pIgplus (Novagen) and cloned into the ApaI to PmeI sites of pEX-mh maintaining the original reading frame to make the Fc-tagged vector pEX-Fc. Various cDNAs for full-length sema K1, extracellular domain of sema K1 (residues starting from Gly-612 to the carboxyl-terminal end were deleted), sema III, and neuropilin-1 were PCR-amplified from cDNA libraries and subcloned into these expression vectors. The neuropilin-2 expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. Marc Tessier-Lavigne (25Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D.

COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the full-length sema K1 in pEX-AP vector using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days after transfection, cells were washed and treated with or without PI-PLC (Boehringer Mannheim) at 250 milliunits/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After phosphate-buffered saline wash, cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-AP antibody (Accurate Antibodies) at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h followed by a Cy3-anti-rabbit antibody at a dilution of 1:200. The fluorescent images of the transfected cells were photographed in a Zeiss microscope using a 40× lens. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the full-length sema K1 in pEX-AP vector with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells transfected with the full-length CD100 in pEX-AP served as a control. Two days after transfection, cells were incubated with or without 250 milliunits/ml of PI-PLC (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 37 °C. Supernatants and cell lysates were collected and run on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel and the AP-tagged sema K1 protein was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-alkaline phosphatase antibody. Stable 293-EBNA cell lines secreting Myc-His-tagged, AP-tagged, or Fc-tagged sema K1 and sema III were derived from transfection of various expression plasmids followed by G418 selection. Conditioned media from stably transfected cell lines were collected and were confirmed for the expression and integrity of recombinant proteins by Western blot using anti-AP, anti-Fc, or anti-Myc antibodies. SDS-PAGE gel demonstrated that sema K1-Fc fusion protein migrates as a dimer linked by the disulfide bonds in the Fc region, whereas the sema K1-mh and AP-sema K1 are monomeric (not shown). Approximately equal amount of AP- or Fc-tagged sema III and sema K1 fusion proteins as judged by Western blot were used in the ligand binding experiments. The amount of active sema III used for the ligand binding experiment was further quantified by a growth cone collapse assay and estimated to be over 80 collapsing units/ml (4Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar,7Kobayashi H. Koppel A.-M. Luo Y. Raper J.-A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8339-8352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with full-length neuropilin-1 or neuropilin-2 expression constructs with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The expression of neuropilin-1 or -2 was confirmed using a monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the Myc tag at the carboxyl-terminal ends of both receptors. After 2 days of transfection, the cells were then incubated with supernatants containing approximately equal amount of sema III-Fc or sema K1-Fc for 1 h. After post-fixing in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, the cells were heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 1 h to destroy the endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. Cells were then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-Fc antibody at 1:500 dilution for 1 h and processed for chromogenic AP enzymatic reaction. For the immune cell staining experiment, P388D1 or RBL-2H3 cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The suspension cells (A20 and Jurkat) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline once and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then cytospun onto glass slides. After blocking for 30 min, AP-sema K1- or AP-sema III-containing supernatants were added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The cells were then post-fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min, and the endogenous AP activity was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 1 h. Cells were then processed for chromogenic AP enzymatic reactions. AP alone was used as a negative control. For experiments in which sema K1-mh or sema III-mh was used to compete with AP-sema K1 or AP-sema III binding, respectively, sema K1-mh or sema III-mh was incubated with different cell lines for 30 min at room temperature prior to AP-sema K1 or AP-sema III incubation. A 298-base pair DNA fragment corresponding to the sequence of mouse EST AA260340was PCR-amplified from a mouse cDNA library. This DNA fragment is predicted to encode a mouse homologue of human sema K1 based on the fact that it shares over 95% amino acid identity with the corresponding region of human sema K1. It was used as a probe in the Northern blot analysis and the in situ hybridization experiments. Northern blot was either purchased fromCLONTECH (Fig. 4 A) or prepared as follows (Fig. 4 B). Adult mouse tissues were homogenized in UltraspecTM RNA reagent (Biotecx), and total RNA was extracted and precipitated. Poly(A)+ RNA was further selected using FastTrack 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Two-microgram poly(A)+ RNA from each tissue was run in formaldehyde gels and blotted onto positively charged nylon membranes (Boehringer Mannheim). DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using random prime labeling kit of Life Technologies, Inc. Hybridization was performed in NorthernMax Buffer (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. In situhybridization procedure was performed on cryostat sections of E11, E15 mouse embryos, and on brain and spinal cord sections of P3 and 5-week-old mice (C57BL/6J) as described (32Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4 °C and embedded in OCT embedding compound. 20-μm sections were cut and were treated with 1.0 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C, 0.2 m HCl for 20 min, and then acetylated for 10 min with 0.1 m triethanolamine and 0.25% acetic anhydride. Sections were prehybridized for 1 h at 65 °C, then hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled probes (2 μg/ml) overnight at 55 °C. The hybridization buffer consists of 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 × Denhardt's, 0.25 mg/ml tRNA, 0.1 mg/ml single-stranded DNA. After hybridization, slides were washed with 0.2 × SSC for 60 min at 65 °C and detected with an AP-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody at a dilution of 1:2000. In an effort to identify veterbrate homologues of viral semaphorins, we searched existing EST data bases against semaphorin-like sequences found in vaccinia virus and in alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AHV sema) using the BLAST algorithm (33Altschul S.-F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.-W. Lipman D.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69631) Google Scholar). Four human and one mouse ESTs were identified, which encode novel sequences that were most homologous to AHV sema (28Ensser A. Fleckenstein B. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed based on the EST sequences and were used to obtain a 2.5-kilobase pair cDNA that encodes a candidate semaphorin gene. The cDNA contains all the human EST sequences and predicts a protein of 634 amino acids with a molecular mass of 71.5 kDa (Fig. 1 A). This protein is named semaphorin K1 (sema K1), since sema A to J has been designated for other known semaphorins in mouse genome data base and sequence analysis indicates that sema K1 is the first member of a new semaphorin subfamily (see below). Hydropathy analysis of the predicted sema K1 sequence (34Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17086) Google Scholar) indicates that the sema K1 sequence is slightly incomplete, lacking approximately half of the signal peptide sequence required for protein secretion (35von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). Consistent with this predication, the alignment between AHV sema and sema K1 also showed an eight-amino acid difference at the amino-terminal end of sema K1 (Fig.1 A). The hydropathy analysis of sema K1 also identified a long stretch of hydrophobic residues at the carboxyl-terminal end, which resembles a signal peptide sequence required for GPI anchorage (36Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Thus, sema K1 is predicted to be the first GPI-linked membrane protein in the semaphorin family. The sequence of sema K1 is closely related to that of AHV sema. Whereas the sema domain of sema K1 shares 50% amino acid identity with that of AHV sema, it shares less than 30% identity with that of other known semaphorins. In addition, 17 out of 18 cysteine residues and 4 out of 5 potential N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved (Fig.1 A). The homology extends throughout the entire amino acid sequences of sema K1 and AHV sema except at the carboxyl-terminal end, where only sema K1 contains the signal peptide sequence for GPI anchorage. Thus, sema K1 is predicted to be a GPI-anchored membrane protein, whereas AHV sema is likely to be a secreted protein. The unique structural arrangement of sema K1 suggests that it may define a new subfamily of vertebrate semaphorins. Consistent with this hypothesis, protein sequence homology analysis showed that sema K1 and AHV sema belong to the same branch of the dendrogram tree and this branch is distinct from that of other semaphorins (Fig. 1 B). Sequence alignment with other semaphorins also revealed that members of the viral-related semaphorin subfamily lack three tryptophan residues conserved in other semaphorins, suggesting that viral-related semaphorins may contain a structurally distinct sema domain. To confirm that sema K1 is a GPI-anchored membrane protein, we have transfected COS-7 cells with a sema K1 expression construct and determined the localization of the expressed sema K1 protein. To track sema K1 protein expression, an AP-tagged version of sema K1 was engineered in which the human placenta alkaline phosphatase was fused to the full-length sema K1 at the NH2 terminus. This fusion protein can be detected with an anti-AP antibody or AP activity. Upon transfection of the expression construct into COS-7 cells, the sema K1 fusion protein was detected on the surface of those transfected cells (Fig.2 A). Treatment with PI-PLC resulted in a complete removal of the fusion protein from cell surfaces (Fig. 2 B). To examine whether the release of sema K1 fusion protein from cell surfaces is a specific action of PI-PLC rather than the result of random proteolysis, we compared the presence of this fusion protein in the supernatant and lysate of transfected COS-7 cells with or without PI-PLC treatment. Supernatants and lysates from PI-PLC treated or untreated cells were subjected to Western blot analysis. A 150-kDa protein corresponding to the predicted size of the fusion protein was detected with the anti-AP antibody. When the transfected COS-7 cells were not treated with PI-PLC, most, if not all, of the fusion protein was found to be associated with the cell lysate (Fig.2 C). Treatment of these cells with PI-PLC resulted in significant release of the fusion protein from the cell lysate into the supernatant, without apparent proteolysis (Fig. 2 C). In a control experiment, PI-PLC treatment did not release the transmembrane semaphorin CD100 into the cell supernatant (not shown). Furthermore, when a stop codon was introduced immediately NH2-terminal to the predicted signal peptide sequence for GPI linkage (residues starting from Gly-612 to the carboxyl-terminal end were deleted), the resultant sema K1 protein was released to the cell supernatant in the absence of PI-PLC (not shown). Thus, we conclude that sema K1 is attached to the cell membrane via a GPI linkage. Neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2 have recently been identified as receptors or components of a receptor complex for sema III and other secreted semaphorins (24He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To determine whether sema K1 could use neuropilin-1 or -2 as its receptor, we tested the ability of sema K1 to bind COS-7 cells transfected with neuropilin expression constructs. Soluble sema K1 fusion proteins containing either an AP tag at the NH2 terminus (AP-sema K1), an Fc domain of human IgG1 at the COOH terminus (sema K1-Fc), or a Myc-His tag at the COOH terminus (sema K1-mh) were produced and were used in the ligand binding assay. Similarly arranged AP-sema III, sema III-Fc, and sema III-mh fusion proteins were prepared as controls. To test for interactions with neuropilin-1 or -2, sema K1-Fc, or AP-sema K1 were incubated with neuropilin-expressing COS-7 cells, and ligand binding was detected using an anti-Fc antibody or a chromogenic AP enzymatic reaction. Under conditions where sema III-Fc binds to COS-7 cells expressing neuropilin-1 or -2, the dimerized sema K1-Fc does not bind to either (Fig. 3, A–D, note that sema III binds to neuropilin-2 with lower affinity than to neuropilin-1). In this experiment, sema III-Fc does not bind to mock-transfected COS-7 cells and Fc-tagged MUC18, an adhesion molecule served as a control, does not bind to the neuropilin-expressing COS-7 cells (not shown). Both served as negative controls. Similarly, under conditions when AP-sema III can bind to COS-7 cells expressing neuropilin-1 or -2, the monomeric AP-sema K1 does not bind to these cells (data not shown). Thus, sema K1 does not bind neuropilin-1 or -2 with high affinity and may not act through these receptors. To determine whether or not the soluble sema K1 fusion proteins are competent to bind a cognate receptor and to provide an entry point for investigating the role of sema K1 in modulating immune function, we analyzed several immune cell lines for the presence of sema K1 binding sites. AP-sema K1 or AP-sema III were incubated with Jurkat T cells, A20 B cells, P388D1 macrophages, and RBL-2H3 mast cell lines and the bound ligands were detected with chromogenic AP enzymatic reaction (Fig. 3, E–J). AP-sema K1 bound only to the cell surfaces of P388D1 macrophage and RBL-2H3 mast cell lines. This binding is specific, since AP alone does not bind to any of the cell lines, and the binding could be competed by preincubation with sema K1-mh. In comparison, AP-sema III binding was detected on cell surfaces of all four immune cell lines tested. This binding is also specific, since preincubation of these cells with sema III-mh blocks the binding (not shown). The ability of sema III-Fc or sema K1-Fc to bind these four cell lines was also tested and similar results obtained (not shown). We conclude that sema III can bind the four immune cell lines tested, which contrasts with the more selective binding of sema K1 to macrophage and mast cell lines, suggesting the existence of a specific receptor for sema K1 in these cell lines. To help define the biological role of sema K1, we examined the expression of sema K1 by Northern blot analysis andin situ hybridization. A 298-base pair cDNA corresponding to the mouse homologue of human sema K1 was used as a probe in these studies. This probe does not cross-hybridize with the mRNA of other semaphorins. Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from adult mouse tissues revealed a single sema K1 transcript at 4.4 kilobase pairs (Fig. 4). The sema K1 transcript is highly expressed in brain, spinal cord, lung, and testis; moderately expressed in heart, muscle, adrenal gland, lymph nodes, thymus, and intestine; weakly expressed in spleen and kidney; and not detectable in liver, bone marrow, and stomach. To examine the distribution of sema K1 mRNA in detail, in situ hybridization analysis was performed on tissue sections of embryonic day 11 and day 15 embryos, and on the"

Among other facilitory roles, BAG-1 may serve as a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70/Hsc70 family proteins and thus represents the first example of a eukaryotic homologue of the bacterial co-chaperone GrpE. In this study, the interactions between BAG-1 and Hsc70 are characterized and compared with the analogous GrpE-DnaK bacterial system. In contrast to GrpE, which binds DnaK as a dimer, BAG-1 binds to Hsc70 as a monomer with a 1:1 stoichiometry.

Molecular chaperones assist in protein folding by preventing misfolding and aggregation, but these important molecules also play other vital cellular roles such as import, translocation, and degradation of proteins (1Morimoto R.I.

Members of the 70-kDa heat shock family bind to linear peptide folding intermediates, and this binding is mediated by cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis, followed by ADP/ATP exchange and peptide release (4Flynn G.C.

The Hsp70 proteins consist of two domains: an amino-terminal ATPase domain (∼45 kDa) and a carboxyl-terminal domain that is composed of a 15-kDa substrate-binding module and a 10-kDa module with undefined function. The three-dimensional structures of the ATPase domain from bovine Hsc70 (7Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and the substrate-binding domain from theE. coli homologue DnaK (8Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) have been determined. Most recently, the crystal structure of the DnaK ATPase domain bound to the co-chaperone GrpE has been reported (9Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Liberto M.D. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). From a comparison of nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound forms in these structures, a model has been proposed wherein a conformational change in DnaK is induced upon ATP binding. The ATP-bound form of Hsp70 binds and releases peptide quickly, whereas the ADP-bound form maintains tight binding to substrate (5Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 10Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In bacteria, binding of substrate to DnaK is regulated by the co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE (11Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of binding and hydrolysis of ATP has not been clearly defined, regulation by co-chaperone molecules is consistent with a conformational adjustment between the two functional domains of Hsp70. Therefore, it is likely that other partner proteins that bind to Hsp70 could also modulate the chaperone activity and thereby affect associated cellular functions. 70-kDa heat shock protein Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein glutathione S-transferase glutathione-agarose surface plasmon resonance isothermal titration calorimetry resonance unit. BAG-1 is a novel multifunctional protein first identified as a molecule that binds to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and promotes cell survival (12Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Since its discovery, BAG-1 has been shown to form complexes with several other proteins including tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors such as hepatocyte growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (13Bardelli A. Longati P. Albero D. Goruppi S. Schneider C. Ponzetto C. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf-1 (14Wang H.-G. Takayama S. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7063-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and the retinoic acid receptor (15Liu R. Takayama S. Zheng Y.

Longer isoforms of BAG-1 with unique amino-terminal domains have also been reported to form complexes with steroid hormone receptors including androgen, estrogen, thyroid, and glucocorticoid receptors (16Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem.

Binding of BAG-1 to these molecules modulates their activity, and thus it has been proposed that BAG-1 may play a facilitory role in multiple cellular processes. The mechanism by which BAG-1 influences the activities of such diverse proteins can probably be attributed to its ability to directly bind Hsp70/Hsc70 family proteins, which in turn interact with multiple target proteins in cells. Both the murine BAG-1 protein and a longer isoform of human BAG-1 known as RAP46 (16Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) have been reported to bind Hsp70 and Hsc70 in vitro and in cells. These proteins also modulate the chaperone activity of Hsp70/Hsc70 in vitro (19Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aimé-Sempé C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C.

Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). BAG-1 contains an amino-terminal region with sequence homology to ubiquitin and a central region (residues 90–172) that binds to Bcl-2 (12Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Its carboxyl-terminal domain is required for complex formation with Raf-1 and growth factor receptors. It is this latter domain that interacts directly with Hsp70, binding to the ATPase domain of the 70-kDa heat shock proteins. It was proposed recently that BAG-1 may act as a eukaryotic regulator of Hsp70 activity, with a functional role similar to the action of GrpE on DnaK, the bacterial equivalent of Hsp70 (21Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, in the present study we have characterized the binding of BAG-1 to Hsc70 and have compared the interactions with those reported for GrpE-DnaK complexes. GrpE binds as a dimer to DnaK (9Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Liberto M.D. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In contrast, we demonstrate here that BAG-1 binds as a monomer to Hsc70. Biophysical analysis and molecular modeling show that the BAG-1 protein shares fewer structural similarities with GrpE than functional ones, suggesting that structural homology may not be necessary for translation into specific function. The 219-amino acid murine BAG-1 protein was cloned as described (12Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) using the pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) transformed as a GST fusion protein into XL-1 blue Escherichia coli (Stratagene). Overnight cultures of a single colony per 500 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were diluted 1:1 with the same medium. After 1 h, expression of the protein was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cultures were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with aeration. Cells were recovered by centrifugation, flash-frozen, and stored overnight at −80 °C. Frozen cells were thawed, resuspended in 10 ml of extraction solution 1 (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% NaN3, 0.04 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) per g of cells, and disrupted using a Dounce tissue grinder. After 30 min, 1 ml of 10× extraction solution 2 (1.5 m NaCl, 100 mm CaCl2, 100 mm MgSO4, 20 μg/ml DNase, 50 μg/ml ovomucoid (trypsin inhibitor)) was added per 10 ml of cell solution, which was mixed briefly and sonicated. The lysate was cleared of cell debris by centrifugation. Triton X-100 (1% v/v) was added to the lysate, and the sample was loaded onto a glutathione-agarose (Sigma) column equilibrated with GA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl) and 1% Triton X-100. The loaded column was washed overnight at 4 °C with GAM buffer (GA buffer with 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). GST-BAG-1 fusion protein was eluted using 5 mm reduced glutathione freshly added to GAM buffer. (When the GST-BAG-1 fusion protein was purified for SPR experiments, only a Q-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) ion exchange column was used for further purification). After dialysis versusGAM buffer, 4 units of human thrombin (Sigma) per mg of fusion protein and 2.5 mm CaCl2 were added, and the solution was incubated for 18–24 h at room temperature. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) was added to the cleaved protein solution, which was then dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column preequilibrated with dialysate. Bound protein was eluted at pH 7.2 in 20 mm HEPES and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol using a salt gradient (100–500 mm NaCl). Further purification of BAG-1 was achieved using a Superdex-75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column equilibrated at pH 7.2 with 20 mm HEPES, 250 mmNaCl, and 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Purified BAG-1 was then stored at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μm EDTA. An extinction coefficient was estimated for BAG-1 using both a Bradford assay and a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) to be ε280 = 3,300 m−1cm−1. A similar value was obtained using other prediction methods (22Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). The 540-residue fragment of human Hsc70ΔE protein encompassing the entire ATPase domain (kindly provided by I. Hirai, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Japan) was expressed as a His6 fusion protein from plasmids inserted into a pET vector and transformed into BL21 (DE3)E. coli. Overnight 50-ml cultures in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were diluted 20× with the same medium. After 3 h, the protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cultures were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with aeration. Cells were recovered by centrifugation, flash-frozen, and stored overnight at −80 °C. Frozen cells were thawed, resuspended in 10 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid extraction solution 1 (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% NaN3, 0.04 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) per g of cells and disrupted using a Dounce tissue grinder. After 30 min, 1 ml of 10× extraction solution 2 was added per 10 ml of cell solution, which was mixed briefly and sonicated. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and Triton X-100 (1% v/v) was added. The sample was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose or Superflow (QIAGEN) column equilibrated with GA buffer and 1% Triton X-100. The loaded column was washed overnight at 4 °C with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid wash buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole). Hsc70ΔE-His6 fusion protein was eluted using 100 mm imidazole in PBS and dialyzed into ½× GAM buffer (25 mm Tris pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose ion exchange column equilibrated with dialysate. Bound protein was eluted at pH 8 in 25 mm Tris and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol using a salt gradient (100–500 mmNaCl). Further purification was achieved using a Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column equilibrated at pH 8 with 50 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Purified Hsc70ΔE was then stored at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5–10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μm EDTA. An extinction coefficient for Hsc70ΔE was estimated using a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) to be ε280 = 21,466m−1 cm−1 and was predicted similarly using the equation in Ref. 22Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar. A DynaPro-801 molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions) was used to determine molecular shape, aggregation state, and degree of purity of the proteins. BAG-1 and Hsc70ΔE were analyzed at concentrations of approximately 1 mg/ml in various buffers. Each sample was 300 μl in volume and was centrifuged at 80,000 rpm using a Beckman Airfuge™ air-driven ultracentrifuge and filtered through a 0.1-μm Whatman Anatop inorganic membrane prior to analysis. At least 50 measurements were made and exported for each experiment using the AutoPro software package, the results of which were averaged to determine apparent Mr and polydispersity index, and replotted into frequency histograms of apparent Mr using KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck Software). Only conditions that resulted in reproducible and stable measurements are reported; conditions resulting in large aggregates or a high degree of noise were discarded as nonoptimal. Molecular weight values are reported as the average calculated values, with S.D. values equal to the degree of polydispersity, where a polydispersity index less than 30% of the hydrodynamic radius (RH) is considered well behaved and unimodal (23Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Burley S.K. Structure. 1994; 2: 357-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A 62A DS circular dichroism spectrometer (Aviv) was used to measure the ellipticity of samples of purified BAG-1 at 0.3 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8. The spectra (recorded at 0.5-nm intervals) were averaged over five scans, taken in the far UV region from 260 to 190 nm. Mean molar ellipticity, [θ], was calculated, and data were fitted to prediction software (Prosec, provided with the instrument, and K2D (24Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar)) to determine structural composition. A Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge was used to perform sedimentation equilibrium experiments on both BAG-1 and Hsc70ΔE. Protein solutions were extensively dialyzed against the appropriate buffer (either 20 mm HEPES or 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C. Partial specific volumes (v̄) of 0.745 ml/g for BAG-1 and 0.740 ml/g for Hsc70ΔE, calculated from their amino acid sequences using Sedinterp, 2This program is available via anonymous FTP from the RASMB network, bbri.harvard.edu. were used in all calculations. All experiments used six-channel, 12-mm-thick, charcoal-epon centerpieces contained within double-ended aluminum housings. The three sample channels contained different loading concentrations of protein (∼120 μl), while reference channels contained the dialysate. Speeds ranged from 18,000 to 22,000 rpm, at 20–25 °C. Data acquisition was as an average of 10–15 absorbance measurements taken over 0.001–0.005-cm intervals. Buffer densities were calculated and corrected for temperature, using the method of Ref. 25Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, England1992: 90-125Google Scholar. Once the samples had reached sedimentation and chemical equilibrium, absorbance scans were taken across the sample. Data were then corrected for window aberrations, dust, and partial masking of light pulses via subtraction of a 360-nm scan from the 280-nm scan, using the correction program XLABASE.2 This corrected absorbance scan was then used in analysis. All analyses involved fitting a model to absorbance versuscell radius data using nonlinear regression. Fitting was performed using the ORIGIN software package (Microcal Software) in conjunction with an additional module supplied by Beckman Instruments. In each case, three different loading concentrations were analyzed simultaneously. Fitting involved varying the molecular weight, association states, a term accounting for the nonideality of the sample, and a baseline offset term until an optimum fit was found. Base-line offset values were initially fixed at those obtained from meniscus depletion of the sample at the end of each experiment. After satisfactory convergence of all other parameters, the base-line offset term was floated, and returned values were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. An Omega titration calorimeter (MicroCal) was used to perform microcalorimetric measurements. Titrations were performed at 25 °C and consisted of 16 injections of 10 μl each, made every 240 s into a reaction cell volume of 1.296 ml. Titrations were generally performed in two ways: 90 μm Hsc70ΔE was titrated into 4 μm BAG-1, or 90 μm BAG-1 was titrated into 4 μmHsc70ΔE. All proteins were in dialysis equilibrium with buffer (either 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μmEDTA, or 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). Control experiments were performed by titrating the same concentrated protein into dialysate. Reaction heats were corrected by subtraction of the appropriate control titration and integrated using ORIGIN ITC software (MicroCal). Thermodynamic parameters for the binding reactions were derived by fitting the corrected binding isotherms to single-site binding models as described (26Wiseman T. Williston W. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar), with stoichiometries (N), enthalpies (ΔH 0), and equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) allowed to float during nonlinear least-squares fits of the data. Under the conditions used, the product of the binding constant (K) and the reservoir macromolecule concentration (C) was approximately 40, within the range expected to provide reasonable estimates of binding equilibria. A BIACORE® 2000 (Biacore AB) surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor was used to measure binding kinetics and affinity constants for the interactions between proteins. CM5 research grade sensor chips, anti-GST monoclonal antibodies, and P20 surfactant were from Biacore. N-Hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, and ethanolamine coupling reagents (Pierce or Biacore) were used to immobilize ∼5,000 RU of the anti-GST to the sensor surface using a standard amine-coupling procedure (27Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfas S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. Stählberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 193: 620-627Google Scholar). Because Hsc70ΔE showed a small degree of nonspecific adsorption to the CM5 chip (20–50 RU), a 3.0 μm solution was first injected into the flow cells derivatized with anti-GST to preblock the surface. It was determined that BAG-1 did not bind nonspecifically to the CM5 dextran surface or to a preadsorbed layer of Hsc70ΔE. Purified GST-BAG-1 was captured onto the anti-GST surface of one flow cell. Five concentrations of Hsc70ΔE (3.0, 1.0, 0.33, 0.11, and 0 μm) were then injected three times in random order over the GST-BAG-1 surface and simultaneously over a parallel control flow cell containing only anti-GST and Hsc70ΔE. In order to minimize mass transport effects, all experiments were done using high flow rates (100 μl/min) on surfaces of relatively low ligand concentration (28Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Analyte solutions were injected for 6 s in HBS running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% P20 surfactant (Biacore)). Because the BAG-1/Hsc70ΔE dissociation rate was rapid and the anti-GST/GST-BAG-1 dissociation rate was practically undetectable, regeneration after each injection was not necessary. Specific interaction data were first subtracted from corresponding controls and zeroed using BIAevaluation 2.0 software (Biacore) and then globally fit to a simple bimolecular reaction model,A+B⇌kdkaABREACTION1using Clamp™ software 3This program is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.hci.utah.edu/cores/biacore/. (29Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Rate equations were generated and then numerically integrated for the entire data set simultaneously. An association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constant were obtained for the entire data set (15 injections) along with residual S.D. values, replication S.D. values, and correlation coefficients. Fits were not improved by using a mass transport model. Dissociation affinity constants were then calculated from KD =kd/ka. Models for human Hsc70 and murine BAG-1 proteins were constructed based on homology with the E. coliDnaK and GrpE proteins, respectively. A sequence alignment was performed for the Hsc70-DnaK and BAG-1-GrpE pairs using the program ClustalW (30Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) and using default values for gap opening and extension penalties. Models for the regions with clear sequence homology were constructed with the modeling package Quanta (Molecular Simulations). Based on the sequence alignment, the residues from the crystal structure of the DnaK-GrpE complex (9Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Liberto M.D. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) (accession code 1DKG, Brookhaven Protein Data Bank) were changed to match the sequences of Hsc70 and BAG-1 using the Mutate function within the Protein Design module of Quanta. A check for buried charged side chains was made with the Protein Health facility of Quanta. Gaps or insertions in the polypeptide chain were connected manually. The models were relaxed by energy minimization using the CHARMM module within Quanta. Harmonic constraints were applied to the backbone atoms of the models, using a force constant of 5 kcal/mol-Å. First, 200 steps of steepest descents energy minimization were completed on the models to relax gross steric conflicts. Second, energy minimization was performed on each model using the conjugate gradient method, until the root mean square force was ≤0.05 kcal/mol-Å. The atomic parameters were from the default file AMINOH.RTF, and cut-offs were applied at atomic separations of 15 Å with switching over the region from 11 to 14 Å. Each model was checked for the acceptability of stereochemistry using Procheck (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Finally, the models were checked for main chain conformation, buried hydrophilic residues, exposed hydrophobic residues, and close contacts using the Protein Health facility of Quanta. For these investigations, full-length murine BAG-1 protein (12Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) was purified after recombinant expression as a GST fusion protein. Except in the case of the SPR studies, BAG-1 was cleaved from its fusion partner by thrombin digestion for solution binding experiments. A C-terminally truncated fragment containing the full ATPase domain of human Hsc70 (Hsc70ΔE) was expressed with an N-terminal His6 affinity tag. The hexahistidine tag was not removed for these studies. Human and murine Hsc70 are 100% identical for the sequence included in this fragment, and the sequences of 43/48 residues are identical between murine and human BAG-1 in the Hsc70 binding region (32Takayama S. Kochel K. Irie S. Inazawa J. Abe T. Sato T. Druck T. Huebner K. Reed J.C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both proteins were purified to >95% homogeneity as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). The molecules were stable at neutral pH in Tris or phosphate buffers and were stored at 4 °C. BAG-1 was identified as a Bcl-2 binding protein but shares no significant homology with the Bcl-2 family (12Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Proteins in the Bcl-2 family function to suppress or enhance apoptosis perhaps in part through their ability to homo- or heterodimerize. Moreover, homodimerization has been shown to be sufficient for activation of other proteins to which BAG-1 binds, such as Raf-1 kinase (33Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it has been speculated that BAG-1 could exist as a homodimer. The results from initial experiments appeared to be consistent with this view, since BAG-1 eluted from size exclusion columns at a position expected for a dimer (19Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aimé-Sempé C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Similarly, dynamic light scattering experiments performed with BAG-1 at neutral pH estimated a molecular mass for BAG-1 of 51 kDa (TableI), equivalent to approximately twice its known molecular mass of 25.4 kDa.Table IDynamic light scattering measurements of BAG-1 and Hsc70ΔE: estimation of molecular mass and degree of aggregationRHaMean hydrodynamic radius derived from the measured translational diffusion coefficient using the Stokes-Einstein equation.Molecular massbMolecular mass estimated from RH assuming that the particles are spherical and of standard density.PolydispersitycPolydispersity derived from the"

The quaternary structure of eotaxin was investigated by ultracentrifugation and NMR, and it was found to be in equilibrium between monomer and dimer under a wide range of conditions. At pH ≤ 5 and low ionic strength, eotaxin was found to be predominantly a monomer. The three-dimensional structure of the eotaxin monomer solved at pH 5.0 revealed that it has a typical chemokine fold, which includes a 3-stranded β-sheet and an overlying α-helix. Except for the N-terminal residues (residues 1–8), the core of the protein is well defined. The eotaxin structure is compared with the chemokines regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1); eotaxin binds only CC chemokine receptor CCR3, whereas RANTES binds many receptors including CCR3, and MCP-1 binds a distinct receptor, CCR2. The RMSD of the eotaxin ensemble of structures with the RANTES average minimized monomeric subunit is 5.52 ± 0.87 Å over all backbone atoms and 1.14 ± 0.09 Å over backbone atoms of residues 11–28 and 34–65. The most important difference between the structures is in the N-terminal residues that are unstructured in eotaxin but structured in RANTES and MCP-1. Several residues in the loop region of RANTES show similar packing in eotaxin (residues 11–17). As the N-terminal and loop regions have been shown to be critical for receptor binding and signaling, this structure will be useful for determining the basis for CCR3 selectivity of the eotaxin.

The rapid assembly and heterotrimer formation have important implications concerning the cellular functions of annexins. Annexins are a ubiquitous family of structurally related proteins that share the common property of reversible Ca2+-dependent binding to membranes containing phosphatidylserine. There are at least 10 annexin genes in mammals, and each cell type expresses several different gene products. Many biological roles have been proposed for these proteins, including vesicle trafficking, membrane fusion, and ion channel formation (1). Whatever the biological functions for these proteins might be, they are certain to be modulated by Ca2+-dependent membrane association. High resolution three-dimensional crystal structures for the soluble forms of several annexins have been determined (1). Each structure shows the characteristic annexin fold, with binding sites that appear to coordinate Ca2+ jointly with phospholipid head groups and mediate peripheral membrane association (1). Although annexins are monomers in solution in the absence of Ca2+, they exist in a variety of quaternary states in crystals, including monomers (2Weng X.W. Luecki H. Song I.S. Kang D.S. Kim S.H.

Despite the wealth of information on crystal structures of the soluble forms, little is known about the membrane-bound state of annexins, information that is critical to evaluating proposed biological functions. Models for membrane-bound annexins include monomers, trimers, and hexamers with protein structures similar to those found in various crystals (Fig. 1). Data bearing on the membrane-bound structure consists primarily of electron microscopy images of stained samples of annexins on supported monolayers. These images have been interpreted as extended lattices of trimers (7Voges D. Berendes R. Burger A. Demange P. Baumeister W. Huber R. J. Mol.

The distinction between a monolayer and bilayer is important especially because one current model of membrane-bound annexin structure is a bilayer-spanning hexamer (6Luecke H. Chang B.T. Mailliar W.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. Nature. 1995; 378: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) similar in structure to the annexin XII hexamer in the three-dimensional crystals (see Fig. 1). Chemical cross-linking studies of annexins V (9Concha N.O. Head J.F. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9045-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) bound to bilayers detected both trimers and hexamers, but limitations of the method make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding multimerization or topography. To obtain high resolution information on the structure of annexin XII bound to phospholipid bilayers under physiological conditions, we introduce a site-directed spin labeling approach that permits the study of the static structure on the membrane as well as the kinetics of its assembly. The general strategy of site-directed spin labeling involves the introduction of a unique cysteine residue that can be modified with a sulfhydryl-selective nitroxide reagent. The present studies use a methanethiosulfonate reagent that generates the spin-labeled side chain designated R1 (11Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C.A. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 1The abbreviations used are: EPRelectron paramagnetic resonance. spectrum of R1 in a folded protein is sensitive to the mobility of the nitroxide. A comprehensive analysis of T4 lysoyzme showed that it is possible to resolve loop, helix surface, tertiary contact, and buried sites in the folded protein on the basis of R1 mobility (13Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In addition, the interspin distance between two R1 side chains can be estimated for distances up to about 25Å (14Hustedt E.J. Smirnov A.I. Laub C.F. Cobb C.E. Beth A.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1861-1877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15Mchaourab H.S. Oh K.J. Fang C.J. Hubbell W.L.

In an isotropic sample containing mobile nitroxides, spin-spin interaction gives rise to a broadening of the spectral features, with a concomitant decrease in intensity (17Farrens D.L. Altenbach C.

In the present work, we place R1 side chains at specific sites in annexin XII and employ both mobility and spin-spin interactions to analyze the structure of the membrane-bound form. electron paramagnetic resonance. Specific mutations were introduced into the annexin XII pSE420-mrp33H plasmid (10Mailliard W.S. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9045-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using the single-site mutagenesis kit fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). First, two native cysteines in annexin XII were replaced with alanines (C113A/C303A). The C113A/C302A mrp33H.09 plasmid was used as the starting point for all the mutations reported herein. The following single mutations were introduced into C133A/C302A: R16C, K27C, I29C, K132C, E163C, D188C, S228C, and L260C. The CLONTECH method was used to introduce additional mutations into R16C and K27C to create two double mutants, R16C/E163C and K27C/D188C. One final double mutant, I29C/S228C, was created by removing the small BlpI/HindIII fragment from I29C and replacing it with the smallBlp I/Hind fragment of S228C. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The annexin XII mutants were expressed in recombinant bacteria and purified by reversible Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipid vesicles followed by column chromatography according to previously published protocols (10Mailliard W.S. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9045-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), except that dithiothreitol (2 mm) was added to all the buffers. The CD spectrum and Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding properties of cysteine-less annexin XII were indistinguishable from those of wild type annexin XII (data not shown). Dithiothreitol was removed from the buffer in which the isolated proteins were stored by size exclusion chromatography (P-10 columns) immediately before modification of introduced cysteines with (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate under the following conditions: 2 h at room temperature, 10× molar excess reagent, 20 mm HEPES buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Unreacted reagent was removed by size exclusion chromatography (P-10 columns). Spin-labeled mutants of annexin XII are designated by giving the sequence position of the cysteine substitution followed by the code for the nitroxide spin label, R1. Vesicles with a lipid composition of phosphatidylserine (bovine brain)/phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk) in a 2/1 molar ratio were prepared according to the Reeves/Dowben protocol (18Reeves J. Dowben R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1969; 73: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The lipid:protein molar ratio in EPR experiments was typically 500:1. EPR experiments were performed by adding spin-labeled annexin XII mutants (∼30 μg of protein) to buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4)-containing vesicles. In certain experiments, complete binding of annexin XII to the vesicles was induced by Ca2+ (1 mm). EPR spectra were obtained using a Varian E-109 spectrometer fitted with a loop gap resonator (19Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 1879-1886Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All spectra were obtained at 2 mW incident microwave power using a field modulation of ∼1 G. To discriminate between the models shown in Fig.1, R1 was introduced at sites in annexin XII indicated in Fig. 2. Site 132 was selected because R1 residues at this position would be in close proximity with strong spin-spin interaction in the trimer or hexamer but not in the monomer (Fig. 2 A). As an additional test for the formation of trimers or hexamers, the double mutants 27R1/188R1 and 16R1/163R1 were prepared (see “Experimental Procedures”). Within a monomer the residues in each pair are far apart (>20 Å), but in a trimer they lie in close proximity at a contact face. Finally, to distinguish trimers from hexamers, 260R1 and double mutant 29R1/228R1 were prepared (Fig. 2 B). In the hexamer, residue 260 is within 5 Å of a symmetry-related residue 260 in the opposing trimer. Likewise, residues 29 and 228 in opposing trimers are within 5 Å of each other in the hexamer but are far apart in the monomer or trimer. Thus spin-labeled annexins 260R1 and 29R1/228R1 are expected to show spin-spin interaction only in the hexameric state. In the presence of phospholipid vesicles but without Ca2+, annexin XII exists as a monomer in solution (10Mailliard W.S. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9045-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the EPR spectra for 132R1, 16R1/163R1, and 27R1/188R1 are similar, having narrow line shapes characteristic of R1 with a high mobility (Fig. 3 A, blue traces). In each case, Ca2+ addition triggers annexin binding to the vesicles, with a dramatic decrease in EPR spectral amplitude (Fig. 3 A, red traces). The decrease in amplitude is a consequence of spectral broadening, due to strong spin-spin interactions in the membrane-bound structure, as can be seen in the spectra at high gain (Fig. 3 A,black, dashed traces). The existence of these specific interactions rules out the monomer model but is consistent with a trimer (or hexamer) similar to that in Fig. 2 in the membrane-bound state. The addition of Ca2+ in the absence of membranes has no effect on the line shapes in solution (data not shown), demonstrating that the spectral changes triggered by Ca2+are in fact related to assembly of a structure on the bilayer surface. Previous studies reported the formation of oligomers in solutions of Ca2+ without membranes (10Mailliard W.S. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9045-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, much higher concentrations of Ca2+ and protein were employed in those studies. If the spectral broadening upon membrane binding is due to specific spin-spin interactions between monomers in an oligomer, the EPR spectra should be altered by mixing labeled with unlabeled monomer before Ca2+ addition. For example, Fig.4 shows a plot of the amplitude of the central resonance line for 132R1 versus f, the fraction of labeled monomer in the sample. Assuming random mixing of labeled and unlabeled monomers and strong interaction of spin pairs in the oligomer, the form of this plot may be predicted for various oligomer stoichiometries from the binomial theorem (see the legend of Fig. 4). The solid curves in the figure give the predicted variation of amplitude with f for dimers (blue trace), trimers (red trace), and hexamers (green trace). As can be seen, the data are well fit by the trimer prediction. Taken together, the data of Figs. 3 and 4 provide strong evidence that the membrane-bound state triggered by Ca2+closely resembles that of the crystallographic trimer. At high dilution with unlabeled, Cys-less annexin XII (f = 0.1), the EPR spectrum of 132R1 is that of a single R1 side chain in a trimer in the absence of spin-spin interaction (Fig. 3 A, green trace). The line shape reflects a relatively high mobility for R1, consistent with the location of 132 in a loop facing a central cavity in the trimer structure (Fig. 2 A). For the double mutants 16R1/163R1 and 27R1/188R1, the spectral line shapes in the trimer in the absence of spin-spin interactions were obtained as the algebraic sums of the spectra of the corresponding single mutants in the membrane-bound states (Fig. 3 A, green traces). These spectra reflect motionally constrained R1 side chains, consistent with the expected locations at protein-protein contact sites (Fig.2 A). Other specific evidence against the formation of the hexameric state comes from the complete lack of spin-spin interaction in the mutants 260R1 and 29R1/228R1. As noted above, residues at these sites lie in close proximity in the crystallographic hexamer and would be expected to show strong spin-spin interaction. However, as shown in Fig.3 B, the spectrum of 260R1 bound to vesicles (red trace) is not particularly broad and is unchanged by dilution with unlabeled annexin XII before Ca2+ addition (f = 0.33, green trace). For the double mutant 29R1/228R1, the spectrum bound to vesicles (red trace) is essentially identical with the sum of the spectra of the corresponding single mutants (Fig. 3 B, green trace). These results are in contrast to the dramatic differences observed for similar comparisons in the data of Fig. 3 A(compare red and green traces) and clearly demonstrate a lack of spin-spin interaction between R1 side chains in 260R1 and 29R1/228R1, making it unlikely that a significant population of hexamer exists in the membrane-bound state. The strong spin-spin interaction developed upon trimer formation in 132R1 affords an opportunity to monitor both the time course of trimer formation and subunit exchange between trimers. For example, Fig.5 A shows a trace of the central resonance amplitude after the stopped-flow mixing of 132R1 and vesicles in the presence of Ca2+. The decrease in amplitude traces the development of spin-spin interaction, a process essentially complete within ∼150 ms under the conditions employed. In fact, the amplitude decreases to approximately 50% of its final value within the ∼4-ms dead time of the instrument (19Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 1879-1886Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The speed of this process is remarkable considering that multiple protein-Ca2+ lipid interactions must be formed in addition to protein-protein contacts between the three monomers. Although more extensive studies will be required to draw conclusions regarding the mechanism of assembly, these data provide the first illustration of the remarkable overall rapidity of the event, a point of potential significance to the biological function of annexins. Fig. 5 B illustrates the time course of subunit exchange between annexin XII trimers. In this experiment, vesicles containing pre-assembled 132R1 trimers in the presence of Ca2+ were mixed with unlabeled Cys-less annexin XII. Initially, the EPR spectral amplitude is low due to spin-spin interaction within the trimers. Upon the addition of unlabeled protein, the amplitude increased over a period of about 2 h, reflecting a decrease in spin-spin interaction resulting from mixing of labeled and unlabeled protein. The final amplitude is that expected from the fraction of labeled monomer present, and the EPR line shape after complete mixing is essentially identical to that of 132R1 in a dilute trimer (Fig. 3 B,green trace for 132). These data clearly establish that subunit exchange occurs on a time scale orders of magnitude slower than that of trimer formation. In an analogous fashion, mixing of annexin XII with other members of the annexin gene family can be assayed. For example, Fig. 3 C(green trace) shows the spectrum obtained by addition of Ca2+ to a mixture of hydra annexin XII 132R1 and an excess of unlabeled human annexin V. This spectrum is indistinguishable from that obtained by addition of Ca2+ to a mixture of annexin XII 132R1 and an excess of unlabeled annexin XII (Fig. 3 A,green trace for 132R1). However, if annexin V is added 10 min after annexin XII 132R1 membrane binding, the strongly interacting spectrum of the annexin XII 132R1 homotrimer (Fig. 3 C,red line) is obtained, due to the slow subunit exchange. The data clearly show that different members of the annexin gene family can form heterotrimers, an event not previously reported. In summary, the data presented in this report directly demonstrate that 1) under the conditions tested, a trimer similar to that in the crystal structure forms the dominant population of annexin XII bound to lipid bilayers; 2) Ca2+-triggered annexin XII trimer formation on the membrane surface can occur on the scale of milliseconds, raising the possibility of annexin involvement in rapid vesicle fusion events, such as synaptic transmission; and 3) despite their evolutionary distance, human annexin V and hydra annexin XII have retained the ability to cross-oligomerize. Since all mammalian cells express several different annexin gene products, we propose that the formation of heterotrimers be added to the list of possible regulatory elements in the annexin system.

Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The bifunctional character of the SLRPs, exhibited when the core protein binds to collagen fibrils and the highly charged glycosaminoglycans (GAG), can regulate interfibrillar spacing and contribute to the precise topology of fibrillar collagens in the cornea. Keratan sulfate (KS), dermatan sulfate (DS), and chondroitin sulfates (CS) are major GAGs in the corneal stroma (3Axelsson I. Acta Ophthalmol. 1984; 62: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Poole A.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and the ratios of various proteoglycans in the corneal stroma relate to the stromal water distribution. For example, during wound healing, reduction of the KSPG to CSPG ratio in corneal scar tissue may account for increased water content (5Hassell J.R. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It has been shown that corneas from patients with macular dystrophy synthesize an essentially normal CSPG, but do not synthesize normal mature KSPG, indicating that KSPG plays a major role in the maintenance of corneal transparency (6Hassell J.R.

They share many common structural motifs, e.g. central leucine-rich tandem repeats and conserved N-linked glycosylation. They diversify in the N- and C-terminal domains and their sites of KS-substitution. The differences among keratocan, lumican, and mimecan imply that each individual KSPG member may have distinct roles in regulating corneal stromal collagen fibrillogenesis, and therefore, corneal transparency.To examine the structure and function of keratocan, we isolated and sequenced mouse keratocan cDNA and genomic DNA, and determined the spatiotemporal expression patterns of the mouse keratocan gene by Northern blot and in situ hybridization.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have isolated and characterized the mouse keratocan gene and its expression during development. Like lumican, another corneal KSPG member of SLRP gene family, mouse keratocan has all the structural features of SLRPs, i.e. a central domain of leucine-rich repeats that is flanked by N- and C-terminal domains with conserved cysteines (16Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The size and structure of the mouse keratocan gene are similar to the lumican gene, which is approximately 6.5 kb and has three exons, with the second exon encoding all ten leucine-rich repeats. Interestingly, both the lumican and keratocan gene have been mapped to the distal chromosome 10 of the mouse genome (17Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Hevelone N.A. Stech M.E. Justice M.J. Conrad G.W. Liu C.-Y. Kao W.W.-Y. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 2296-2303PubMed Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number AF022256). Moreover, like the mouse lumican gene (13Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L. Swiergiel J. Roth M.R. Conrad G.W. Kao W.W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30306-30313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the mouse keratocan gene is a TATA-less gene. Before the submission of this report, it had been shown that there was also no TATA box in the bovine keratocan gene (18Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M. Conrad G.W. Gene(Amst.). 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). These results suggest that keratocan and lumican are very closely related genes in the SLRP family.We previously reported that the Lum gene was widely expressed in many tissues other than cornea. Similarly, expression of mimecan mRNA is not restricted to the cornea (10Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M. Roth M.R. Funderburgh M.L. Tasheva E.S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28089-28095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the keratocan gene is selectively expressed by corneal stromal cells in the adult mouse. Northern blots show that the lumican mRNA level in cornea declines significantly after the postnatal stage (13Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L. Swiergiel J. Roth M.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30306-30313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but keratocan mRNA still maintains a constant level throughout development (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that keratocan may have a unique function in maintaining corneal physiology. Generation of keratocan null-mice will shed light on the role of keratocan in regulating corneal transparency and may also yield a useful animal model for studying certain human corneal dystrophies that may result from abnormal KSPG metabolism.Vertebrate corneal development has been extensively studied using the chick embryo as a model (19Hay E.D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 63: 263-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It is known that there are two waves of mesenchymal cell migration into the developing cornea (20Meier S. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1982; 82: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). Once the corneal epithelium has formed and synthesized the primary stroma, periocular mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin migrate along the surface of the lens and contribute to the development of the corneal endothelium and trabecular meshwork. Subsequently, the second wave of neural crest cells invade the primary stroma and differentiate into corneal keratocytes that synthesize the specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) of the secondary stroma. Studies have demonstrated that the distribution of ECMs showed spatial and temporal variations during corneal development (21Doane K.J. Ting W.-H. McLaughlin J.S. Birk D. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Migration and differentiation of neural crest cells could be regulated by the interactions between cells and ECM components, e.g. collagens, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. Little is known about how periocular mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin migrate and differentiate into keratocytes in the mouse. In the present study, we observed that keratocan gene expression starts as early as E13.5 in periocular mesenchymal cells migrating toward the cornea and sclera, but its expression gradually became restricted to corneal keratocytes in E18.5 and adult mice (Figs.5 and 6). This observation differs from that found in bovine ocular tissues, in which keratocan can be detected both in cornea and sclera (8Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Bottomley G.S. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9759-9763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M. Conrad G.W. Gene(Amst.). 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Our results suggest that it may have a keratocyte lineage-specific regulation of the keratocan gene in the mouse. Keratocan can serve as a specific marker for corneal keratocyte. We hypothesize that these keratocan expressing periocular mesenchymal cells found in E13.5 embryos and the keratocytes found in adult mice are important players for the development and maintenance of transparent corneas. Efforts to elucidate the corneal stromal cell lineage-specific expression of the keratocan gene will lead to a better understanding of molecular basis of corneal stromal development. Our ongoing experiments are designed to characterize the promoter/enhancer region of the keratocan gene with the object of establishing the minimal cis-regulatory DNA elements that confer corneal stromal specific expression. The transparency of the cornea, as proposed by the lattice model of Maurice (1Maurice D.M. Davson H. Vegetative Physiology and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984: 49-57Google Scholar), is based on the presence of collagen fibrils of small and regular diameter (22.5–35 nm) spaced at regular intervals (42–44 nm). Small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) 1The abbreviations used are: SLRPssmall leucine-rich proteoglycansRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsBACbacterial artificial chromosomeDS/CSPGdermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycanGAGglycosaminoglycanGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseKSPGkeratan sulfate proteoglycanLumlumican genePCRpolymerase chain reactionRNaseribonucleaseSSC0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm citrate buffer, pH. 7.0Eembryonic daykbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: SLRPssmall leucine-rich proteoglycansRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsBACbacterial artificial chromosomeDS/CSPGdermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycanGAGglycosaminoglycanGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseKSPGkeratan sulfate proteoglycanLumlumican genePCRpolymerase chain reactionRNaseribonucleaseSSC0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm citrate buffer, pH. 7.0Eembryonic daykbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s). have long been thought to be key regulators of collagen fibrillogenesis,e.g. fibril diameter, interfibrillar spacing (2Rada J.A. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The bifunctional character of the SLRPs, exhibited when the core protein binds to collagen fibrils and the highly charged glycosaminoglycans (GAG), can regulate interfibrillar spacing and contribute to the precise topology of fibrillar collagens in the cornea. Keratan sulfate (KS), dermatan sulfate (DS), and chondroitin sulfates (CS) are major GAGs in the corneal stroma (3Axelsson I.

J. 1986; 236: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and the ratios of various proteoglycans in the corneal stroma relate to the stromal water distribution. For example, during wound healing, reduction of the KSPG to CSPG ratio in corneal scar tissue may account for increased water content (5Hassell J.R. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It has been shown that corneas from patients with macular dystrophy synthesize an essentially normal CSPG, but do not synthesize normal mature KSPG, indicating that KSPG plays a major role in the maintenance of corneal transparency (6Hassell J.R.

They share many common structural motifs, e.g. central leucine-rich tandem repeats and conserved N-linked glycosylation. They diversify in the N- and C-terminal domains and their sites of KS-substitution. The differences among keratocan, lumican, and mimecan imply that each individual KSPG member may have distinct roles in regulating corneal stromal collagen fibrillogenesis, and therefore, corneal transparency. To examine the structure and function of keratocan, we isolated and sequenced mouse keratocan cDNA and genomic DNA, and determined the spatiotemporal expression patterns of the mouse keratocan gene by Northern blot and in situ hybridization. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have isolated and characterized the mouse keratocan gene and its expression during development. Like lumican, another corneal KSPG member of SLRP gene family, mouse keratocan has all the structural features of SLRPs, i.e. a central domain of leucine-rich repeats that is flanked by N- and C-terminal domains with conserved cysteines (16Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The size and structure of the mouse keratocan gene are similar to the lumican gene, which is approximately 6.5 kb and has three exons, with the second exon encoding all ten leucine-rich repeats. Interestingly, both the lumican and keratocan gene have been mapped to the distal chromosome 10 of the mouse genome (17Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Hevelone N.A. Stech M.E. Justice M.J. Conrad G.W. Liu C.-Y. Kao W.W.-Y. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 2296-2303PubMed Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number AF022256). Moreover, like the mouse lumican gene (13Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L. Swiergiel J. Roth M.R. Conrad G.W. Kao W.W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30306-30313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the mouse keratocan gene is a TATA-less gene. Before the submission of this report, it had been shown that there was also no TATA box in the bovine keratocan gene (18Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M. Conrad G.W. Gene(Amst.). 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). These results suggest that keratocan and lumican are very closely related genes in the SLRP family.We previously reported that the Lum gene was widely expressed in many tissues other than cornea. Similarly, expression of mimecan mRNA is not restricted to the cornea (10Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M. Roth M.R. Funderburgh M.L. Tasheva E.S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28089-28095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the keratocan gene is selectively expressed by corneal stromal cells in the adult mouse. Northern blots show that the lumican mRNA level in cornea declines significantly after the postnatal stage (13Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L. Swiergiel J. Roth M.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30306-30313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but keratocan mRNA still maintains a constant level throughout development (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that keratocan may have a unique function in maintaining corneal physiology. Generation of keratocan null-mice will shed light on the role of keratocan in regulating corneal transparency and may also yield a useful animal model for studying certain human corneal dystrophies that may result from abnormal KSPG metabolism.Vertebrate corneal development has been extensively studied using the chick embryo as a model (19Hay E.D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 63: 263-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It is known that there are two waves of mesenchymal cell migration into the developing cornea (20Meier S. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1982; 82: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar). Once the corneal epithelium has formed and synthesized the primary stroma, periocular mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin migrate along the surface of the lens and contribute to the development of the corneal endothelium and trabecular meshwork. Subsequently, the second wave of neural crest cells invade the primary stroma and differentiate into corneal keratocytes that synthesize the specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) of the secondary stroma. Studies have demonstrated that the distribution of ECMs showed spatial and temporal variations during corneal development (21Doane K.J. Ting W.-H. McLaughlin J.S. Birk D. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Migration and differentiation of neural crest cells could be regulated by the interactions between cells and ECM components, e.g. collagens, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. Little is known about how periocular mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin migrate and differentiate into keratocytes in the mouse. In the present study, we observed that keratocan gene expression starts as early as E13.5 in periocular mesenchymal cells migrating toward the cornea and sclera, but its expression gradually became restricted to corneal keratocytes in E18.5 and adult mice (Figs.5 and 6). This observation differs from that found in bovine ocular tissues, in which keratocan can be detected both in cornea and sclera (8Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Bottomley G.S.

Gene(Amst.). 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Our results suggest that it may have a keratocyte lineage-specific regulation of the keratocan gene in the mouse. Keratocan can serve as a specific marker for corneal keratocyte. We hypothesize that these keratocan expressing periocular mesenchymal cells found in E13.5 embryos and the keratocytes found in adult mice are important players for the development and maintenance of transparent corneas. Efforts to elucidate the corneal stromal cell lineage-specific expression of the keratocan gene will lead to a better understanding of molecular basis of corneal stromal development. Our ongoing experiments are designed to characterize the promoter/enhancer region of the keratocan gene with the object of establishing the minimal cis-regulatory DNA elements that confer corneal stromal specific expression.

Glu681 of human AE1 may form part of the anion translocation apparatus and the permeability barrier. We have therefore studied the structure of the sequence surrounding Glu681, using scanning cysteine mutagenesis. Residues of the Ser643 (adjacent to the glycosylation site) to Ser690 region of cysteineless mutant (AE1C−) were replaced individually with cysteine. The ability of mutants to mediate Cl−/ HCO3− exchange in transfected HEK293 cells revealed that extracellular mutants, W648C, I650C, P652C, L655C, and F659C have an important role in transport. By contrast, only transmembrane mutation E681C fully blocked anion exchange activity. The topology of the region was investigated by comparing cysteine labeling with the membrane-permeant cysteine-directed reagent 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin, with or without prior labeling with membrane-impermeant lucifer yellow iodoacetamide (LYIA). Two regions readily label with 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (Ser643–Met663 and Ile684–Ser690). We propose that poorly labeled Met664–Gln683 corresponds to transmembrane segment 8 of AE1. Regions Ser643–Met663 and Ile684–Ser690 localize, respectively, to extracellular and intracellular sites on the basis of accessibility to LYIA. On the basis of LYIA accessibility, we propose that the Arg656–Met663 region forms a “vestibule” that leads anions to the transport channel. Glu681 is located 3 amino acids from the C terminus of transmembrane segment 8, which places the membrane permeability barrier within 5 Å of the intracellular surface of the membrane.

AE1 (band 3) belongs to a family of anion exchange proteins that facilitate the movement of Cl− and HCO3− across the plasma membrane. Plasma membrane anion exchange proteins are widely expressed among mammalian tissues, where they participate in the regulation of intracellular pH and volume. Three anion exchanger isoforms have been identified, cloned, and sequenced: AE1, found in erythrocytes and kidney; AE2, found in kidney, stomach, and lymphocytes; and AE3, found in the brain, retina, and heart (1Kopito R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 123: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All of these anion exchange proteins contain two domains. The highly conserved (70% identity) membrane domain of approximately 55 kDa spans the bilayer 12–14 times and is responsible for anion exchange activity. The cytoplasmic domain of 45–110 kDa is more divergent. In erythrocyte AE1, the cytoplasmic domain anchors the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane through interactions with ankyrin (2Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 145-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). AE1 has served as a model for our understanding of membrane protein structure and function because of its high expression in erythrocytes, where it constitutes 50% of the integral membrane protein (3Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar). AE1 was among the first membrane transport proteins to have its cDNA cloned and sequenced (4Kopito R.R. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1985; 316: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of information regarding anion exchangers, we still do not know which residues of the protein are involved in the transport process. Jennings and co-workers implicated Glu681 in the transport process, since labeling this residue with Woodward's reagent K (WRK) 1The abbreviations used are: WRKWoodward's reagent KAE1C−cysteineless AE1BCECF-AM2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-(5 and 6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl esterbiotin maleimide3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytinLYIAlucifer yellow iodoacetamide, dipotassium saltstilbene maleimide4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, disodium saltTLCKN-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketoneTPCKN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketonePBSphosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: WRKWoodward's reagent KAE1C−cysteineless AE1BCECF-AM2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-(5 and 6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl esterbiotin maleimide3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytinLYIAlucifer yellow iodoacetamide, dipotassium saltstilbene maleimide4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, disodium saltTLCKN-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketoneTPCKN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketonePBSphosphate-buffered saline. and reduction with sodium borohydride resulted in altered anion exchange kinetics (5Jennings M.L.

The functional role of Glu681 in AE1 was confirmed in mutagenesis experiments of mouse AE1 (8Chernova M.N. Jiang L. Crest M. Hand M. Vandorpe D.H. Strange K. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and extended to the homologous position of mouse AE2, suggesting that the mechanistic role of Glu681 is conserved among anion exchange proteins (9Sekler I. Lo R.S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28751-28758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). WRK chemical modification of AE1 abolishes chloride transport, yet relieves the requirement for proton cotransport during sulfate transport. During sulfate transport in unmodified AE1, a proton, supplied by Glu681 is cotransported. Sulfate/proton cotransport takes place in both inward and outward directions, which implies that Glu681 has access to both the intracellular and extracellular sides of the membrane. Taken together, Glu681is functionally involved in anion exchange events and may reside at the permeability barrier of AE1. Determination of the location of this residue in the transmembrane region will localize both a part of the transport site and the permeability barrier.

Our current knowledge of AE1 topology comes from both experimental data and hydropathy plots. Hydropathy plots show regions of strong hydrophobicity in the N-terminal half of the membrane domain corresponding to the first seven transmembrane segments of AE1. However, our limited knowledge of the topology of the membrane domain of AE1 has recently been reviewed (10Reithmeier R.A.F. Chan S.L. Popov M. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S.

Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), localizing this residue to the external face. Antibody accessibility studies have mapped the extreme C terminus and two other loops to the cytoplasm (14Lieberman D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol.

We have chosen to study the topology of the initial portion of the second half of AE1 membrane domain, beginning at the well defined external site of N-glycosylation (from Ser643 to Ser690), using introduced cysteine scanning mutagenesis. Mutation of individual amino acids to cysteine represents a minor structural modification, relative to other methods in use to define topology and therefore has some potential advantages. Our goals were to define the membrane topology of an functionally important region of human AE1 anion exchange protein and to validate the use of cysteine scanning mutagenesis to the study of protein topology of mammalian membrane proteins. We have previously constructed a version of human AE1, lacking all cysteines and characterized it as functional (16Casey J.R. Ding Y. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual introduced cysteine codons were cloned into AE1C− to yield mutants, each with a unique cysteine codon. Introduced cysteine mutants at amino acids 645–647 were not constructed, because their codons overlap with theSmaI site (nucleotides 2048–2053), used to clone introduced cysteine mutants into AE1C−. Mutagenesis was performed using a polymerase chain reaction megaprimer mutagenesis strategy (19Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar,20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6761) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed using the Primers program (Whitehead Institute for Medical Research). Polymerase chain reaction was performed using an ERICOMP thermal cycler and either Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) or PWO polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Anion exchangers were expressed by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (21Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 52: 59-72Crossref Scopus (3439) Google Scholar), as described previously (22Ruetz S. Lindsey A.E. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), except that calcium phosphate-precipitated plasmid was added at 2.8 μg of anion exchanger plasmid with 4.2 μg of pRBG4 carrier/100-mm tissue culture dish. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), and 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) and harvested 48 h post-transfection. A synthetic peptide composed of cysteine followed by the C-terminal 13 amino acids of human AE1 was synthesized, yielding peptide: NH2-CEGRDEYDEVAMPV-COOH. The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and subsequently injected into two rabbits numbered 1657 and 1658. Serum from each rabbit was monitored, on immunoblots containing AE1 protein, until a maximal immune response was observed. Rabbits were sacrificed and exsanguinated, and sera designated 1657 and 1658 were isolated. Both sera have high anti-AE1 titer. Peptide synthesis and antiserum production were completed by SynPep (Dublin, CA). Lysates of whole tissue culture cells were prepared by incubation of cells from one-half of a 100-mm dish, with 250 μl of IPB buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mmEDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μm TPCK, 200 μm TLCK, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, on ice for 15–30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g in an IEC Micromax microcentrifuge. The sample was precleared with 2 μl of preimmune rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose. Each immunoprecipitation used 2 μl of anti-AE1 antibody 1658 and was incubated at 4 °C, overnight, with protein A-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resin was washed consecutively with 1 ml each of wash buffer 1 (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), wash buffer 2 (2 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5), and wash buffer 3 (2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Samples were eluted from the resin by incubation for 5 min at 65 °C with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205363) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were transfected with wild type or mutant AE1 cDNA, as described above. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested by incubation with 1 mg/ml trypsin in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 6.5 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected from the plate with a pipette and sedimented by centrifugation for 5 min at 228 × g. Cells were then washed with PBS. After resuspension in 2 ml of PBSCM (PBS buffer containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.0), cells were divided into two equal samples, labeled + and −. To the + sample, 30 μl of 17 mm lucifer yellow iodoacetamide (LYIA) was added, and the sample was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with gentle, occasional mixing. Then 10 μl of 2 mm biotin maleimide (in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to both the + and − samples, and the samples were incubated with occasional mixing for 15 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were sedimented as above and washed with PBSCM. Sedimented cells were then lysed with 250 μl of IPB containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 200 μm TPCK, 200 μm TLCK, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 15 min. In experiments to measure ability to label with biotin maleimide, samples were prepared as described above for − samples. After immunoprecipitation, samples were electrophoresed on 8% acrylamide gels (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205363) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon membrane (24Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44626) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins were detected by incubation of the blot with 10 ml of 1:2500 diluted streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBSTB buffer (TBST buffer (0.1% (v/v), Tween-20, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5), containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). After a 1.5-h incubation, blots were washed with TBST. Blots were visualized using ECL reagent and Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After analyzing each sample for incorporation of biotin, samples were normalized for variations in recovery of AE1 protein as follows. The blots from above were stripped by incubation in 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 50 °C for 15 min. Blots were then processed as immunoblots (above), using 10 ml of TBSTM (TBST, containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk powder (Carnation)) and 3 μl of monoclonal anti-AE1 antibody, IVF12 (25Jennings M.L. Anderson M.P. Monaghan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing (see above), blots were probed with 10 ml of 1:3000 diluted horseradish peroxidase conjugated to sheep anti-mouse IgG and subsequently processed with ECL reagent (see above). The fraction of anion exchanger protein processed to the cell surface was assessed by labeling intact, whole transfected cells with biocytin hydrazide (26Gershoni J.M. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK293 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and deplated by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C with 1 mg/ml trypsin in PBS. All steps of the labeling were performed at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 2.7 ml of PBSCM. To this was added 300 μl of 100 mmsodium metaperiodate, and cells were incubated for 30 min in the dark with gentle occasional mixing. Cells were washed twice with PBSCM, by centrifugation for 5 min at 228 × g. Cells were resuspended in 1.25 ml of 1 mm biocytin hydrazide, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and incubated for 30 min in the dark with gentle occasional mixing. Cells were washed twice, as above. A whole cell extract was then prepared by solubilization of the cell pellet in IPB buffer containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 200 μm TPCK, 200 μm TLCK, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After AE1 immunoprecipitation (see above), samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide gels (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205363) Google Scholar). After transfer to Immobilon, biotinylated proteins were detected by incubation of the blot with 10 ml of 1:2500 diluted streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase in TBSTB. After a 1.5-h incubation, blots were washed with TBST, and the image was processed with ECL reagent (see above). HEK293 cells were grown on top of 7 × 11-mm glass coverslips in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected as described. Two days post-transfection, coverslips were rinsed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) and loaded with BCECF-AM dye by incubation in 4 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 2 μm BCECF, for 20–30 min, at 37 °C. Coverslips were mounted in a custom-built quartz cuvette, with perfusion capabilities. Intracellular pH was monitored by measuring fluorescence at excitation wavelengths of 440 and 502 nm and emission of 520 nm, in either a Spex Fluorlog spectrofluorometer or a Photon Technologies International RCR/Delta RAM spectrofluorometer. The cuvette was perfused at 3.5 ml/min alternately with Ringer's buffer (5 mm glucose, 5 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm calcium gluconate, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 140 mm sodium chloride (chloride buffer) or with Ringer's buffer containing 140 mm sodium gluconate (chloride-free buffer). Both buffers were bubbled continuously with air containing 5% carbon dioxide. Intracellular pH was calibrated by the nigericin-high potassium method (27Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar), using three pH values from pH 6.5 to 7.5. Transport rates were determined by linear regression of the initial linear rate of change of pH, using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software). Immunoblots and chemical biotinylation blots were scanned with a Hewlett Packard Scanjet 4C flatbed scanner, calibrated with a Kodak gray scale. Scanned images were quantified using NIH Image 1.60 software. Biotinylation levels were calculated as follows: biotinylationnorm = pixels of biotin signal/pixels of AE1 immunoblot. To correct for variations, each mutant was normalized to the biotinylation level observed for mutant S643C, treated in parallel, and electrophoresed on the same acrylamide gel. Normalized data were calculated as follows: relative biotinylation = (biotinylationnormmutant/biotinylationnormS643C) × 100%. LYIA Accessibility was calculated as follows: LYIA accessibility = biotinylationnorm − LYIA/biotinylationnorm + LYIA. Plasmid DNA for transfections were prepared using Qiagen columns (Qiagen Inc.). DNA sequencing of plasmids was performed by the Core Facility in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, with an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. All other procedures followed standard protocols (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To probe the topology of the region surrounding the functionally essential Glu681 residue of human AE1 protein, we constructed an array of introduced cysteine mutants. In this array, each residue from the site of AE1 glycosylation (Asn642) to Ser690 was individually mutated to cysteine. Each cysteine mutant was cloned into AE1C−, an AE1 mutant with all endogenous cysteine codons mutated to serine (16Casey J.R. Ding Y. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the sites of cysteine mutants constructed in topologically well defined regions of the protein, to verify the labeling methodology. S555C represents a control site for the extracellular surface of the protein, since it is found between two chymotryptic cleavage sites in intact erythrocytes (13Tanner M.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); S595C lies in a hydrophilic region and is separated from S555C by a highly hydrophobic sequence, which defines 595 as an intracellular site; K892C is adjacent to the C terminus of the protein, previously mapped to the inside of the cell (14Lieberman D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10022-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby defining 892 as intracellular; Ser574 is found in the hydrophobic region between Ser555 and Ser595 and therefore is probably in a transmembrane segment. To begin to determine the topology of each residue in the introduced cysteine mutant array, we labeled HEK293 cells expressing a single introduced cysteine mutant with the membrane-permeant, cysteine-directed reagent, biotin maleimide. Fig. 2 shows representative data from the labeling experiments at 10 sites throughout the region. AE1C− labels with biotin maleimide to a barely detectable level, consistent with the absence of cysteine residues from the construct. Cytosolic control mutants S595C and K892C label to a similar extent to Y555C, which is a control site for the external surface of the protein. Interestingly, mutant S574C does not label with biotin maleimide, suggesting that transmembrane residues are not accessible to biotinylation, under the conditions used in this experiment. Fig. 2 B shows the amount of AE1 protein loaded into each lane of the blot in A. It is apparent that all of the mutants express similar amounts of AE1, yet they label differentially with biotin maleimide. All mutants in the Asn642–Ser690 region were subjected to the analysis seen in Fig. 2. The relative level of labeling with biotin maleimide and the amount of AE1 present in each sample were determined by densitometry of the biotinylation blot and the corresponding immunoblot. After normalization of each biotin signal for the AE1 expression level, the degree of biotinylation was expressed as a percentage of the labeling found for the S643C mutant, labeled in parallel. The labeling of the S643C mutant was set to 100. In this way, samples could be compared within an experiment and between experiments. Fig. 3 shows the relative amount of biotin label incorporated into each introduced cysteine mutant. Strikingly, the incorporation of biotin defines two regions, Ser643–Met663 and Ile684–Ser690 that readily label with biotin maleimide, separated by a region, Met664–Gln683, that labels poorly. Thedashed line, representing the mean labeling of AE1C−, indicates that residues Met664–Gln683 have labeling that cannot be differentiated from AE1C−. The filled box at the bottom of Fig. 3 shows the proposed topology for the region, on the basis of biotin maleimide accessibility data. The ability to label with biotin maleimide appears to differentiate residues that are extramembraneous from transmembrane residues, as presented in Figs. 2and 3. In the case of human AE1, we know that the region surrounding Asn642 is extracellular, since the site is glycosylated. However, for the introduced cysteine method to be applicable to define regions of unknown topology, a method is required to differentiate the inside of the cell from the outside. Previously this question has been addressed by labeling introduced cysteine mutants, in intact cells, with biotin maleimide and observing the ability to block this labeling by prelabeling with a membrane-impermeant reagent, stilbene maleimide (29Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In our hands, however, this reagent behaves as membrane-permeant, when used at 10–200 μm, for 15 min at room temperature. Permeability may have been due to the fact that stilbenes have been reported to be weak substrates of AE1 (30Cabantchik Z.I. Greger R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 31: C803-C827Crossref Google Scholar). We therefore chose to use a different membrane-impermeant cysteine-directed reagent, LYIA. This reagent has been used as a fluorescent marker of the pinocytic pathway and is therefore likely to be membrane-impermeant (31Catizone A. Chiantore M.V. Andreola F. Coletti D. Medolago Albani L. Alescio T. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 42: 1229-1242PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments to determine topology, HEK293 cells expressing AE1 introduced cysteine mutants were labeled with biotin maleimide, with or without prelabeling with the membrane-impermeant reagent, LYIA. LYIA reacts only with external cysteine residues and so blocks subsequent reaction with biotin maleimide. Fig. 4shows the degree of biotinylation of representative mutants and the amount of biotinylation that is blocked by LYIA. Fig. 4 Bshows the amount of AE1 expressed in each sample. S555C, a control site for the outside of the cell, shows strong competition of biotinylation by LYIA. In contrast, the two mutants that are intracellular, S595C and K892C, show little effect of LYIA labeling. Residues from Ser643 to Ile661 show varying degrees of competition by LYIA labeling. As expected, E681C, predicted to be in the transmembrane domain (Figs. 2 and 3), does not label with biotin maleimide. Significantly, residues Ile684–Ser690 label with biotin maleimide, but their labeling is affected little by LYIA prelabeling, consistent with an intracellular localization of these sites. Fig. 5 quantifies the degree to which LYIA is able to compete for biotinylation in the whole region from Asn642 to Ser690. Biotinylation data for each residue was normalized by the AE1 expression level in that sample (see Fig. 4, A and B). LYIA accessibility was calculated as the ratio between normalized biotinylation in the absence and presence of LYIA prelabeling (LYIA Accessibility). Residues marked with an asterisk were not characterized in this assay, because they do not label with biotin maleimide (Fig. 3). Contrary to expectations, the region closest to the glycosylation site, Ser643–Leu655 (with the exception of H651C), is not the most accessible to LYIA. Indeed, the region from Arg656–Ile661 is more accessible. Interestingly, in the sequence of residues from Arg656 to Met663, just before the proposed transmembrane region, there is a steady decrease in accessibility to LYIA. The region from Ile684 to Ser690 had low levels of"

Its essential character and unique presence in prokaryotes make it an attractive target for antibacterial chemotherapy. However, purification and characterization of the peptide deformylase have remained a major challenge because this enzyme is extraordinarily labile under a variety of conditions (t1/2 ∼1 min at room temperature). In this work, we show that this unusual instability is because of oxidation of the catalytic Fe2+ ion of the deformylase into catalytically inactive Fe3+ ion by atmospheric oxygen. Oxidation of Fe2+ is accompanied by the conversion of O2 into a yet unidentified reactive species, which covalently modifies the deformylase protein, most likely by oxidizing cysteine-90, a ligand residue of the Fe2+ ion, into a cysteine sulfonic acid. Enzymatic exclusion of O2from the deformylase assays renders the deformylase highly stable under otherwise identical conditions. An improved, readily reproducible purification procedure has been developed that produces approximately 10 mg of pure, fully active Fe2+ deformylase from a liter of cells. In addition, active peptide deformylase can be reconstitutedin vitro from the denatured deformylase.

Protein synthesis in prokaryotes initiates with anN-formylmethionyl-tRNAi, resulting in N-terminal formylation of all nascent polypeptides (1Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1993; 75: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Peptide deformylase catalyzes the subsequent removal of the formyl group from the majority of bacterial proteins (2Adams J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 3Livingston D.M. Leder P. Biochemistry. 1968; 8: 435-443Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Takeda M. Webster R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 60: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the precise functions of the formylation and deformylation steps remain somewhat obscure, genetic studies have shown that the peptide deformylase activity is essential for bacterial survival (5Mazel D. Pochet S. Marliere P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 6Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7387-7390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because peptide deformylase is apparently absent in eukaryotic systems (7Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar, 8Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it provides a potential target for a novel antibacterial strategy (5Mazel D. Pochet S. Marliere P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Very recently, biochemical studies from this laboratory have established that peptide deformylase represents an intriguing new class of amide hydrolyase, which utilizes a ferrous ion as the catalytic metal (7Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar). The unusual structural feature of peptide deformylase and its potential application in antibiotic studies warrant a detailed mechanistic investigation of this class of enzymes. Although the deformylase activity was recognized three decades ago (2Adams J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 3Livingston D.M. Leder P. Biochemistry. 1968; 8: 435-443Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Takeda M. Webster R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 60: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the extraordinary lability of this enzyme has long prevented its purification and characterization. It was reported that even mild procedures such as dialysis, Sephadex G-100 or DEAE-cellulose chromatography, or ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradient resulted in almost quantitative loss of enzymatic activity (2Adams J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 3Livingston D.M. Leder P. Biochemistry. 1968; 8: 435-443Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At 37 °C, the deformylase in a crude cell lysate lost activity with a half-life of 60 s (3Livingston D.M. Leder P. Biochemistry. 1968; 8: 435-443Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have recently overexpressed the deformylase fromEscherichia coli and purified the active enzyme to homogeneity (7Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar, 9Rajagopalan P.T.R. Datta A. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13910-13918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the purified enzyme remains highly unstable, complicating the quantitative evaluation of its activity. In this work, we have found that the instability of peptide deformylase is because of oxidation of the catalytic Fe2+ ion into the catalytically inactive ferric ion by atmospheric O2. A simple experimental procedure has been developed to preserve the deformylase activity. These findings will greatly facilitate future mechanistic investigations of the peptide deformylase as well as high throughput screening for deformylase inhibitors. Glucose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4), superoxide dismutase, and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) from Aspergillus nigerwere purchased from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY). Aeromonasaminopeptidase and all chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Company. All purification buffers were exhaustively degassed under vacuum and then sparged with argon prior to use. Buffer A, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% protamine sulfate; buffer B, 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl; buffer C, 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl; buffer D, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl. The purification procedure reported previously (9Rajagopalan P.T.R. Datta A. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13910-13918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was modified as follows to maximize the yield of the Fe2+-containing deformylase, previously referred to as “peak 2” (7Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 0–4 °C unless otherwise stated. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying plasmid pET-22b-def (9Rajagopalan P.T.R. Datta A. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13910-13918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were grown in LB medium containing 75 mg ampicillin/liter at 37 °C. When the OD600 reached 0.6, the cells were induced by the addition of 100 μmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h. The cells (6 liters) were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 5,000 rpm) and resuspended in 100 ml of buffer A containing 100 μg of chicken egg white lysozyme/ml and a protease inhibitor mixture (100 μg of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride/ml, 20 μg trypsin inhibitor/ml, 20 μg leupeptin/ml, 20 μg pepstatin/ml). The cells were lysed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by sonication (5 × 10 s pulses). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The clear supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.5 × 7.5 cm) that had been equilibrated in buffer B. The adsorbed molecules were eluted with 150 ml of buffer B plus a linear gradient of 10–380 mm NaCl at 4.0 ml/min. The deformylase eluted at approximately 100–220 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled (∼50 ml) and precipitated by adjusting to 80% saturation with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was redissolved in ∼12 ml of buffer C plus 1.2 m ammonium sulfate and loaded onto a Pharmacia HiLoad 16/10 phenyl-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated in buffer C plus 1.7 mammonium sulfate. Elution was performed with buffer C and a reverse ammonium sulfate gradient (1.7–0 m; 200 ml at 4.0 ml/min). The deformylase was separated into two species on this column, with peak 1 (eluted at ∼1.0 m ammonium sulfate) being the Zn2+-containing enzyme and peak 2 (eluted at ∼0.76m ammonium sulfate) being the Fe2+-containing enzyme. The active fractions under each peak were pooled separately and concentrated in a Centriprep-10 apparatus (Amicon). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 33% (v/v), and the enzyme was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) using BSA as standard and then corrected according to the equation: actual concentration = 0.71 × concentration from Bradford (based on quantitative metal analysis of pure Fe2+ and Zn2+ deformylases). Deformylase activity was assayed by measuring the initial rate of hydrolysis of fML-pNA 1The abbreviations used are: fML-pNAN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-p-nitroanilideGnHClguanidinium hydrochlorideBSAbovine serum albuminESIelectrospray ionizationMSmass spectrometryHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. (11Wei Y. Pei D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Typically, 0.05–1.0 μg of deformylase was added to 1 ml of buffer D containing 100 μm fML-pNA and 0.4 unit ofAeromonas aminopeptidase. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature and monitored on a Perkin-Elmer λ3 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 405 nm. The initial rate was calculated over the first 30 s. Under these conditions, the deformylase is saturated with the substrate and therefore, the maximum velocity (Vmax) was measured. N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-p-nitroanilide guanidinium hydrochloride bovine serum albumin electrospray ionization mass spectrometry high pressure liquid chromatography. The Fe2+ and Fe3+ contents in deformylase were measured by modification of a literature procedure (12Vogel A.I. A Textbook of Quantitative Inorganic Analysis Including Elementary Instrumental Analysis. 3rd Ed. John Wiley and Sons, NY1961: 785-787Google Scholar). To measure Fe2+ content, the deformylase protein (typically 2–4 mg/ml) was denatured by the addition of an equal volume of 8m GnHCl, and 1,10-phenanthroline in 0.5 msodium acetate (pH 5.0) was immediately added to a final concentration of 5–10 mm. The absorbance at 510 nm was measured on the λ3 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The concentration of Fe2+ in the sample was then calculated by comparison with a standard line generated with known concentrations of inorganic Fe2+. For Fe3+ measurement, the deformylase sample (2–4 mg/ml) was denatured by the addition of HCl (final 1n) and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. A stock solution of potassium thiocyanate was then added to the clear supernatant to a final concentration of 1m (total volume 100 μl). The absorbance at 480 nm was measured and compared with a Fe3+ standard line to determine the Fe3+ content in the sample. Freshly thawed, highly active deformylase in buffer D (2.8 mg of enzyme in 1 ml) was incubated at room temperature, exposed to atmospheric oxygen. At various times (0–26 h), 50-μl aliquots were withdrawn and the remaining catalytic activity and Fe2+ content were determined as described above. The Fe2+ and Fe3+ contents were also determined at the conclusion of the experiment. Salt free deformylase samples (typically 10–50 μg) were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and passed through a C-8 reversed-phase HPLC column (eluted with acetonitrile plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) before being injected into a Perkin-Elmer mass spectrometer (model API-300). To locate the site(s) of modification in the deformylase, the highly active Fe2+ deformylase (∼1 mg/ml in buffer C) was exposed to air for 14 h at room temperature; this procedure resulted in loss of >99% deformylase activity. The inactivated enzyme was then digested to completion with 0.1 molar equivalent of trypsin in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (12 h at room temperature). The digest was passed through a C-18 reversed-phase column, eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in deionized H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0–100% acetonitrile in 30 min at 1 ml/min) before mass spectrometric analysis. All major peaks in the mass spectra were identified by comparison with a tryptic map of the deformylase using Bio MultiView 1.2 software (Perkin-Elmer Inc.). The glucose oxidase and catalase system was chosen to generate and maintain a partially anaerobic environment (13Englander S.W. Calhoun D.B. Englander J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A solution (1.0 ml) containing buffer D, 100 μm fML-pNA, 0.4 units of Aeromonasaminopeptidase, 20 mmd-glucose, 0.5 units of glucose oxidase, and 700 units of catalase was prepared in a polystyrene cuvette. The contents were mixed, and 0.5 ml of mineral oil was immediately added to form a thin layer on top of the aqueous solution, which helps to deter atmospheric O2 from entering the assay solution. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2–5 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 ng of the deformylase, which was carried out by inserting a pipette tip through the mineral oil layer into the aqueous phase. Zn2+deformylase (4.5 mg/ml), previously referred to as peak 1 (7Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar), was denatured by the addition of an equal volume of 8 m GnHCl. EDTA was then added to a final concentration of 100 mm. The resulting mixture was applied to a Pharmacia Superdex 75 column equilibrated in 4 m GnHCl, and the column was eluted with 4m GnHCl. Fractions containing the deformylase (monitored at 280 nm) were collected and concentrated in a Centriprep-10 apparatus before its use in reconstitution experiments. Refolding experiments were carried out directly under the assay conditions described above but in the presence of 100 μm Zn2+, Fe2+, or Fe3+. Typically, 1.5 μg of metal-free deformylase (10 μl) in 4 m GnHCl was added to 1.0 ml of buffer D containing 100 μm fML-pNA, 0.4 unitAeromonas aminopeptidase, and 100 μm metal ion. Refolding was monitored by following the hydrolysis of fML-pNA spectrophotometrically at 405 nm (11Wei Y. Pei D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Control experiments without any added metal ions were also performed. Refolding in a low oxygen environment was similarly carried out but in the presence of d-glucose, glucose oxidase, and catalase. Extraordinary lability has been a hallmark of peptide deformylase. Although high levels of deformylase activity were readily detectable in crude, freshly prepared cell lysates, this activity was rapidly lost (t1/2 ∼1 min) upon any attempt of purification (e.g. gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography, sucrose sedimentation) (2Adams J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 3Livingston D.M. Leder P. Biochemistry. 1968; 8: 435-443Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Takeda M. Webster R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 60: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These observations led to earlier proposals that peptide deformylase requires cofactor(s) that are removed by the purification procedures. We have recently succeeded in the purification of E. coli deformylase in large quantities through overexpression (7Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar, 9Rajagopalan P.T.R. Datta A. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13910-13918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The extensively purified deformylase (the Fe2+-containing form) is catalytically active but remains highly unstable. When incubated at room temperature under deformylase assay conditions, where the enzyme is usually present at low concentrations (∼0.1 μg/ml), it is inactivated at a half-life of ∼1 min. The enzyme is considerably more stable at 4 °C, but still loses ∼40% activity in 10 min. The deformylase shows improved stability if stored as concentrated solutions (>1 mg/ml). However, with the addition of a carrier protein (e.g. BSA), glycerol, or a variety of common enzyme cofactors, all failed to preserve the activity. In contrast to the Fe2+ deformylase, the apparently nonphysiological less active variant, Zn2+-containing deformylase (previously described as peak 1) (7Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar), is very stable under all of the conditions tested. These observations suggest that enzyme inactivation is likely because of factors other than loss of cofactor(s). Because peptide deformylase is an important enzyme both from a mechanistic viewpoint (a novel Fe2+-containing amidase) and as a potential target for antibiotic design, we have undertaken a series of biochemical investigations to determine the mechanism of its rapid inactivation. The dramatically different stability between the Fe2+ and Zn2+ deformylases, which share the same polypeptide sequence (7Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar), prompted us to examine the valence state of iron in the inactivated deformylase, as the Fe2+ ion could be oxidized into the Fe3+ ion by atmospheric O2. We have found that simple exposure of the active Fe2+ deformylase (2.8 mg/ml) to air for two days at room temperature results in complete loss of deformylase activity. This inactivation is accompanied by precipitation of the deformylase protein. Metal analysis of the inactivated sample revealed the presence of 0.75 ± 0.24 g-atoms of Fe3+ per polypeptide protein but no detectable Fe2+, indicating a quantitative conversion of Fe2+ into Fe3+. Next, the kinetics of enzyme inactivation and Fe2+ oxidation were examined by withdrawing aliquots of a deformylase sample (2.8 mg/ml) after various times of exposure to air and simultaneously assaying for both remaining deformylase activity and Fe2+ content as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The time courses of the two events are superimposed (Fig.1). Moreover, there is a linear correlation between the remaining activity and Fe2+ content (Fig. 1, inset). This strongly suggests that Fe3+ cannot replace Fe2+ as the catalytic metal, and oxidation of the Fe2+ ion to Fe3+, presumably by atmospheric O2, causes deformylase inactivation. Note that the half-life of the deformylase here is ∼8 h, instead of 1 min as described earlier. This is because of the much higher concentration of deformylase (2.8 mg/ml versus 0.1 μg/ml) used in this experiment (necessary for accurate measurement of Fe2+ content). As mentioned earlier, for reasons that are not yet completely understood, the deformylase is much more stable when it is in a concentrated form. One possibility may be that high concentrations promote protein-protein interactions and prevent O2 from access to the active site. These interactions must be specific, as BSA failed to preserve the deformylase activity. We next examined the possibility of polypeptide modification during enzyme inactivation using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Freshly thawed, active deformylase (both Fe2+ and Zn2+ forms) gave a molecular mass of 19,199 ± 2 Da (Fig. 2 a), in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 19,197 Da (minus the N-terminal methionine). However, after the active Fe2+ deformylase was incubated overnight at room temperature with the solution exposed to air, the resulting sample (which lost >99% activity) gave two peaks of approximately equal intensities at molecular masses of 19,199 and 19,247 Da, respectively (Fig. 2 b). The appearance of the [M + 48] peak indicates that deformylase inactivation is accompanied by covalent modification of the polypeptide component in addition to the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+. To locate the site(s) of modification, the inactivated deformylase was digested with trypsin to completion and analyzed by HPLC/ESI mass spectrometry (Fig.2 c). Analysis of the entire HPLC chromatogram revealed a peptide fragment with a m/z value of 927.2 (positive ion), which does not correspond to any of the fragments derived from the native deformylase. Assuming that this peptide carries two positive charges, a molecular mass of 1852.4 Da can be calculated. This matches a trypsin fragment derived from Ser-81 to Arg-97, SGETGIEEGCLSIPEQR (calculated molecular weight = 1804.4), plus a 48-Da modification. HPLC/ESI mass analysis in the negative ion mode detected a peak with a m/z ratio of 925.2 (data not shown); this would also give a molecular mass of 1852.4 Da if the peptide carries two negative charges. Unfortunately, peptide sequencing by tandem MS/MS experiments was not successful, so the modified amino acid(s) has not been unambiguously identified. However, inspection of the peptide sequence suggests that Cys-90 is most likely the site of covalent modification. Its oxidation into a cysteic acid (cysteine sulfonic acid) would result in an addition of three oxygen atoms to the peptide, which in turn would increase the molecular mass of the peptide by 48 Da. Cys-90 is likely a ligand of the catalytic Fe2+metal (see below). Presumably, during the process of Fe2+oxidation to Fe3+, an O2 molecule is reduced to a superoxide ion or other reactive species, which might oxidatively attack the ligating cysteine (see below). The other amino acid residues in the peptide are either farther away from the iron center and/or more stable against oxidative damage and are thus less likely to be modified. The Zn2+-containing deformylase did not produce a detectable amount of the [M + 48] peak after exposure to air for extended periods of time. Furthermore, the peptide containing the other cysteine (Cys-129) was not modified during the enzyme inactivation process, as judged by mass spectrometry (data not shown). This indicates that modification of Cys-90 is not because of nonspecific oxidation by atmospheric O2. Oxidation of a cysteine to cysteic sulfonic acid or sulfinic acid has previously been observed in a serine/threonine phosphatase (14Goldberg J. Huang H.-B. Kwon Y.-G. Greengard P. Narin A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature ( Lond. ). 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), a nitrile hydratase (15Tsujimura M. Dohmae N. Odaka M. Chijimatsu M. Takio K. Yohda M. Hoshino M. Nagashima S. Endo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29454-29459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the reaction catalyzed by cysteine dioxygenase (16Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All three enzymes are iron metalloenzymes. The occurrence of two modification events (Fe2+ and Cys-90 oxidation) raises the issue of which event is causative of deformylase inactivation. To address this question, we carried out experiments with varying times of air exposure to examine the existence of any correlation between activity loss and cysteic acid formation. No such correlation was found despite repeated experiments. There were samples that had lost >99% deformylase activity but produced the [M + 48] peak at barely detectable levels. In fact, formation of cysteic acid has not exceeded 50% for any sample so far tested. This suggests that oxidation of Cys-90 may only be a consequence rather than the cause of deformylase inactivation. Because both oxidation events require an oxidizing agent and the most likely candidate is atmospheric O2, we examined the stability of the deformylase in a reduced O2 environment. A glucose oxidase/catalase system (13Englander S.W. Calhoun D.B. Englander J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was adapted to generate and maintain a partially anaerobic environment (see “Experimental Procedures”). Indeed, when the O2 level in the assay solution was enzymatically reduced to a minimum, peptide deformylase (0.05 μg/ml) showed remarkably increased stability with only a slight loss of activity after incubation for 10 min at room temperature (Fig. 3). In contrast, in a control experiment in which no glucose oxidase/catalase was added, the deformylase was completely inactivated after 10 min. Note that the addition of glucose/glucose oxidase/catalase resulted in slight reduction in the initial rate. This is most likely because of the introduction of a small amount of O2 during the course of deformylase addition and its subsequent conversion by the glucose oxidase into H2O2, which instantaneously inactivated a small percentage of the added deformylase. Hydrogen peroxide, at micromolar levels (e.g. 100 μm), is capable of rapid and complete inactivation of the Fe2+deformylase by oxidizing the Fe2+ ion into Fe3+ion (7Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar) and promotes the formation of the [M + 48] species and a small amount of higher molecular weight species (data not shown). Addition of either glucose oxidase/catalase or 100 μmH2O2 to the Zn2+ deformylase had no effect on its catalytic activity or stability. A variety of O2 scavengers were then added to the deformylase solutions in an attempt to stabilize the enzymatic activity. Simple addition of reducing agents either had no effect or more often accelerated the enzyme inactivation (e.g.ascorbate, sodium dithionite). On the other hand, addition of these reducing agents to the O2-depleted assay reactions had no effect in all cases. Presumably, the reducing agents convert O2 into some reactive oxygen species (e.g.H2O2) (17Larisch B. Pischetsrieder M. Severin T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 2681-2686Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which in turn oxidizes the ferrous ion in the enzyme. Among the redox enzymes tested, addition of catalase significantly reduces the inactivation rate but does not completely protect the deformylase from oxidative damages. This is evident from the observation that the addition of 10, 100, or 780 units of catalase resulted in similar levels of stabilization (Fig.4). ESI-MS analysis of the inactivated deformylase revealed that the presence of catalase reduced the relative intensity of the [M + 48] peak (data not shown). Superoxide dismutase or BSA had no effect on the enzyme. Because the formation of Fe3+ deformylase during the enzyme inactivation process is complicated with concomitant modification of the polypeptide, we sought to obtain pure Fe3+ deformylase (without Cys-90 oxidation) through in vitro reconstitution, to determine whether Fe2+ to Fe3+ oxidation is sufficient to completely inactivate the deformylase. The less active Zn2+ deformylase was denatured with GnHCl in the presence of 100 mm EDTA and passed through a gel-filtration column. The resulting apoenzyme (1.5 μg in 10 μl of GnHCl) was directly added to deformylase assays to initiate the reactions (reaction volume 1.0 ml), and the amount of reconstituted activities were determined by a continuous assay (11Wei Y. Pei D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In control experiments, addition of 100 μm Zn2+ and Fe2+ to the reactions resulted in specific activities of 0.40 ± 0.04 and 1.83 ± 0.23 μmol·mg−1·min−1 (based on the amount of added apoenzyme), representing 51 and 1% recovery of activity for Zn2+ and Fe2+ deformylases, respectively (Fig. 5). Reconstitution with Fe2+ under the partially anaerobic condition recovered 2.8% activity or a specific activity at 5.03 ± 0.57 μmol·mg−1·min−1. The slightly upward curvature of the reaction progression curve is consistent with a somewhat slow refolding process in the presence of Fe2+(Fig. 5). This implies that in the presence of O2 the deformylase is inactivated as it is folded, giving rise to the lower activity (as compared with that from the anaerobic experiments). All refolding experiments with 100 μm Fe3+ failed to achieve activities higher than the control in which no metal ion was added. Large-scale reconstitution experiments with Fe3+yielded a small amount of a soluble protein but apparently without any bound Fe3+ ion (estimated by complex formation with SCN−). This indicates that Fe3+ deformylase either cannot be formed at all or is catalytically inactive when formed. Thus, oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ is sufficient for deformylase inactivation. We were also able to recover ∼50% deformylase activity (relative to the activities reconstituted from GnHCl-denatured Zn2+ deformylase) from a sample that had previously been completely inactivated by exposure to air, by refolding it in the presence of Fe2+ or Co2+. 2P. T. R. Rajagopalan and D. Pei, unpublished results. This is consistent with the observation that only <50% of the deformylase undergoes cysteine to cysteic acid oxidation. It also rules out cysteic acid formation as the direct cause of enzyme inactivation. Based on the above results, we propose the following mechanism to account for the rapid inactivation of Fe2+ deformylase (Fig. 6). We believe that the Fe2+ enzyme has a similar structure to that of the Zn2+ variant, the structure of which has recently been solved (18Chan M.K. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T.R. Bing H. Tsai C.M. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13904-13909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Meinnel T. Blanquet S. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our laboratories and others2 have recently solved the structures of the Co2+- and Ni2+-substituted deformylases (20Becker A. Schlichting I. Kabsch W. Schultz S. Wagner A.F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11413-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which retain almost full deformylase activity. All three structures are essentially identical, with the metal ion tetrahedrally coordinated by His-132, His-136, Cys-90, and a water molecule (or a hydroxide ion). The Fe2+ ion in the native deformylase likely has the same ligands, as Fe2+ and Zn2+ compete for protein binding (7Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar) and a metal-ligand (Fe2+ to thiolate) charge transfer band is evident at ∼290 nm. In the absence of substrate, molecular O2 may bind to the iron metal, as it does in myoglobin (21Stryer L. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1981: 43-63Google Scholar), cytochrome P450 enzymes (22Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar), and many other iron metalloenzymes that reduce O2 (23Que Jr., L. Ho R.Y.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2607-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). One-electron reduction of O2 generates a ferric intermediate and a bound superoxide ion. The superoxide species can either diffuse out of the enzyme active site, leaving a ferric deformylase behind, or it can oxidize the ligating cysteine-90 into a cysteic acid (the mechanistic detail of this oxidation reaction is not yet clear). It is more likely, though, that the superoxide ion diffuses out of the active site and disproportionates into H2O2 and O2. The resulting H2O2 can go on to inactivate another enzyme molecule in a Fenton reaction and at the same time, generate a hydroxyl radical. The hydroxyl radical could then trigger the oxidation of Cys-90. This would explain why the addition of catalase offers partial stabilization of the enzyme and reduces the amount of the [M + 48] species, as the catalase would prevent the second inactivation event (by H2O2) and the formation of hydroxyl radical but not the first one (by O2). It is unlikely that H2O2 is the species that directly oxidizes Cys-90, because addition of H2O2 to the Zn2+ enzyme had no effect. In either case, the Fe3+ ion dissociates from the protein presumably because of its much smaller size than Fe2+, and therefore lower affinity to the metal binding site (0.69 Å versus 0.75 Å at low-spin state; 0.78 Åversus 0.92 Å at high-spin state). Because the metal ion plays both a catalytic role and a structural role (18Chan M.K. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T.R. Bing H. Tsai C.M. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13904-13909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Meinnel T. Blanquet S. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Becker A. Schlichting I. Kabsch W. Schultz S. Wagner A.F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11413-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), loss of the metal ion would lead to unfolding of the protein. Indeed, the inactivation process is accompanied by deformylase precipitation out of solution, whereas the Zn2+ variant is highly stable against unfolding. The fact that peptide deformylase becomes very stable upon enzymatic removal of O2 from assay solutions provides strong support to this mechanism. The remarkable stability of the Zn2+ deformylase also rules out any possibility of direct modification of the polypeptide component as the cause of activity loss. Our earlier purification procedure produced large amounts of highly active deformylase, but the specific activity of the purified enzyme from different preparations still varied by an order of magnitude (9Rajagopalan P.T.R. Datta A. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13910-13918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the inactivation mechanism has permitted us to optimize the purification procedure for the Fe2+deformylase. Because inactivation of the deformylase is caused by O2 dissolved in the buffers, the improved procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures” has eliminated the ammonium sulfate fractionation and the time-consuming gel-filtration steps. This significantly shortens the overall purification procedure, thus minimizing the exposure of peptide deformylase to O2. It also allows for baseline resolution of the two enzyme forms (Fe2+ versusZn2+) during the last (phenyl-Sepharose) chromatographic step. These modifications do not, however, compromise the purity of the final protein as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (data not shown). This procedure is highly reproducible and produces ∼10 mg of Fe2+ deformylase with consistently high specific activity (kcat/Km = 2.9 × 106m−1 s−1 toward fML-pNA) from a liter of cells. The difference between the results obtained in this laboratory and those reported by others is worthy of some comment. In particular, how can we purify the active deformylase, which has at1/2 ∼1 min at room temperature, whereas the same chromatographic techniques have failed in other laboratories? Two factors are likely to have contributed to our success. First, because O2 is the cause of inactivation, the buffers used in this laboratory for deformylase purification were exhaustively degassed and sparged with argon or nitrogen before use, whereas there was no mention of such procedures in other published works (2Adams J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 3Livingston D.M. Leder P. Biochemistry. 1968; 8: 435-443Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7737-7740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, our overexpression system produces very high levels of peptide deformylase, approximately 50% of total soluble proteins (9Rajagopalan P.T.R. Datta A. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13910-13918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because the deformylase is more stable as a concentrated solution (Ref. 2Adams J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar and this study), the high expression level in our system ensured a relatively concentrated deformylase solution throughout all stages of purification, thus significantly slowing down the inactivation kinetics. Such a procedure, however, would probably not be adequate for the purification of the native deformylase from non-overproducing strains, where deformylase is present at much lower levels. Even a small amount of lingering O2 or air leakage in the system would be sufficient to inactivate all of the deformylase enzyme. Meinnel and Blanquet (24Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7737-7740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also reported high levels of deformylase activity immediately after lysis of their overproducing cells, but this activity was quickly lost during purification. We believe that, like our results, their overexpression system also produced a mixture of Fe2+ and Zn2+ deformylase forms, but the Fe2+ enzyme was rapidly inactivated by O2 (the reported procedure contained long dialysis steps in apparently non-degassed solutions) and precipitated out of solution. What was left in solution was the more stable but much less active Zn2+deformylase. In conclusion, we have elucidated the molecular mechanism behind the extraordinary lability of peptide deformylase, a property that has prevented mechanistic investigation for three decades. Inactivation is caused by O2, which binds to the catalytic Fe2+and oxidizes it into Fe3+, followed by Fe3+dissociation and protein denaturation. A simple procedure has been developed to preserve the deformylase activity by enzymatic removal of O2 from assay solutions. These results will greatly facilitate future biochemical studies of peptide deformylase. We thank Dr. X. C. Yu for assistance in the mass spectroscopic experiments and the reviewers for useful suggestions."

Although steady-state and transient-state kinetic studies of the soluble Zn(II) enzyme with nitrocefin as substrate found no ionizable groups with pKa values between 5.25 and 10.0 involved in catalysis, a kinetically significant proton transfer step in turnover was implicated by studies in deuterium oxide. These studies also detected the accumulation of an enzyme-bound intermediate and provide the basis for a minimal kinetic scheme describing metallo-β-lactamase-catalyzed nitrocefin hydrolysis. Resistance to multiple β-lactam antibiotics traced to the expression of Zn(II) requiring metallo-β-lactamases has emerged in clinical isolates of several bacterial strains includingBacteroides fragilis, a pathogen commonly found in suppurative/surgical infections. A soluble B. fragilismetallo-β-lactamase has been purified to homogeneity from the cell growth medium after expression as a secretory protein inEscherichia coli. The enzyme requires two tightly bound Zn(II) ions for full activity, and the Zn(II) ions can be removed by EDTA from the enzyme. The apoenzyme is reactivated by stoichiometric amounts of Zn(II) and Co(II) ions. The Co(II)-substituted enzyme exhibits a UV-visible spectrum characterized by strong Co(II) d-d transitions at 510, 548, 615, and 635 nm and an EPR spectrum withg values of 5.52, 4.25, and 2.01: features that serve as useful spectroscopic handles for the mechanistic studies of the enzyme.

These studies also detected the accumulation of an enzyme-bound intermediate and provide the basis for a minimal kinetic scheme describing metallo-β-lactamase-catalyzed nitrocefin hydrolysis. The widespread use of antibiotics has put tremendous selective pressure on bacteria to devise mechanisms to escape the lethal action of the drugs. The most common and efficient mechanism for bacteria to subvert β-lactam antibiotics is to produce β-lactamases, a class of enzymes that inactivate the antibiotics by hydrolyzing their β-lactam rings (1Page M.I. Acc. Chem. Res. 1984; 17: 144-151Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The majority of β-lactamases employ an active site serine as a nucleophile to attack the β-lactam carbonyl to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate during the hydrolysis (2Fisher J. Belasco J.G. Khosla S. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2895-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 3Frère J.-M. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4Frère J.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Resistance caused by these enzymes can be generally overcome by carbapenem antibiotics such as imipenem (5Knowles J.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1985; 18: 97-104Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, a small group of β-lactamases, i.e. class B (6Payne D.J. J. Med. Microbiol. 1993; 39: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7Frère J.-M. Mol.

So far, these metallo-β-lactamases have been identified in more than 10 bacterial strains including several pathogenic genera such as Aeromonas, Pseudomonas,Serratia, and Bacteroides. Their emergence represents yet another problem in the crisis spawned by antibiotic resistance. The amino acid sequences of the metallo-β-lactamase fromBacillus cereus (10Amber R.P. Daniel M.

Sequence alignment reveals a 17–34% sequence similarity between them (18Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frère J.-M. Dideberg O.

Although the properties of all the metallo-β-lactamases have been characterized to some extent, detailed studies have only been carried out on the enzymes from B. cereus, B. fragilis, and A. hydrophila. The B. cereus enzyme, which was the first metallo-β-lactamase to be identified, binds one Zn(II) ion with high affinity and a second with much lower affinity (20Davis R.B. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The binding of the high affinity Zn(II) ion is responsible for almost all the enzymatic activity, whereas the binding of the second Zn(II) ion to the low affinity site merely increases the enzyme efficiency (21Baldwin G.S. Galdes A. Hill H.A.O. Smith B.E. Waley S.G. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The B. fragilis enzyme, on the other hand, has two high affinity Zn(II)-binding sites with the occupation of both sites required for maximum enzymatic activity (22Crowder M.W. Wang Z. Frankilin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of the B. cereus and of theB. fragilis enzyme have been solved to 2.5-Å and 1.85-Å resolution, respectively (18Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frère J.-M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 19Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The overall structures of the two enzymes are very similar, comprising an unusual protein fold of a ββ sandwich with helices on each external face and the active site,i.e. the Zn(II)-binding site, at the edge of the sandwich (18Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frère J.-M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 19Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In the structure of the B. cereus enzyme, only the high affinity Zn(II)-binding site is occupied with the Zn(II) ion coordinated by three histidine residues (residues 86, 88, and 149) and a water molecule (18Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frère J.-M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In the structure of the B. fragilisenzyme, both Zn(II)-binding sites are occupied (19Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). One Zn(II) ion is bound by three histidine residues (residues 86, 88, and 149); the second Zn(II) ion is coordinated by cysteine (residue 168), aspartic acid (residue 90), histidine (residue 210), and a water molecule (19Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). A water molecule/hydroxide ion bridges the two Zn(II) ions (19Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). His-88, His-149, His-210, and Asp-90 are conserved in all five of the known metallo-β-lactamase sequences, whereas His-86 and Cys-168 are conserved in four of the five sequences (18Carfi A. Pares S.

Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Recently, two Zn(II) ions were also found in the A. hydrophilametallo-β-lactamase, although the presence of the second Zn(II) ion results in a loss of enzymatic activity (23Valladares M.H. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It seems that metallo-β-lactamases from different sources have differing Zn(II) requirements, which may account for the wide range of catalytic efficiencies of different metallo-β-lactamases (24Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 223-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. fragilis is one of the most important pathogens in polymicrobial infections in humans (25Nord C.-E. Olsson B. Dornbusch K. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 1978; 13: 27-32PubMed Google Scholar, 26Brook I. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1989; 19: 360-376PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Tally F.P. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1993; 16: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, a clinical isolate of B. fragilis expressing a metallo-β-lactamase proved resistant to multiple β-lactam antibiotics (28Turner P. Edwards R. Weston V. Gazis A. Ispahani P. Greenwood D. Lancet. 1995; 345: 1275-1277Abstract PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), underscoring the need for clinically useful inhibitors of the enzyme. One important step to aid in this task is to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. However, the B. fragilis metallo-β-lactamase currently used in biochemical and structural studies (19Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 22Crowder M.W. Wang Z. Frankilin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S.J.

Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 1155-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was produced as inclusion bodies in E. coli. The active enzyme is obtained by renaturing the 8 m urea-solubilized inclusion bodies in metal ion-containing buffer (Zn(II) or Co(II)). The preparation is subject to aggregation at high protein concentration and is not reliably reproducible. 1Z. Wang, unpublished data. The purified Co(II) enzyme failed to show the desired spectroscopic features of a Co(II) enzyme (22Crowder M.W. Wang Z. Frankilin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here, we report the subcloning, overexpression, and purification of a soluble B. fragilis metallo-β-lactamase. Using the soluble enzyme, we were able to characterize the effects of Zn(II) on activity, to prepare a Co(II)-containing enzyme whose spectroscopic features further define the metal ion binding sites, and to establish the minimum kinetic sequence for the enzyme-catalyzed nitrocefin hydrolysis. E. coli strain DH5α was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and plasmid pET-27b(+) were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Plasmid pT7CcrANDE02 harboring the B. fragilis metallo-β-lactamase gene (13Rasmussen B.A. Guzman Y. Tally F.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 1590-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Yang Y. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 1155-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Beth A. Rasmussen of the American Cyanamid Co. (Pearl River, NY). Nitrocefin was a gift from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (Harlow, United Kingdom). Metal-free buffers were prepared by treating the buffers with Chelex-100 resin according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Bio-Rad). Metal-free dialysis tubing was prepared as described by Auld (30Auld D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 40-50Google Scholar). Spectroscopically pure ZnSO4 and CoCl2 in Milli Q water stock solutions were used as Zn(II) and Co(II) sources. Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes used in cloning and sequencing were from commercial sources as indicated. The renatured B. fragilis metallo-β-lactamase was purified from the 8m urea-solubilized inclusion bodies according to the procedures described previously (22Crowder M.W. Wang Z. Frankilin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were analytical reagents or molecular biology grade from commercial suppliers. Two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-CTTTTCCCTGTCGCAGCCATGGCACAG-3′ (having a NcoI site) and 5′-GGAATACCGGGTAGGATCCTACAATTC-3′ (having aBamHI site), were designed based on the deoxynucleotide sequences of a truncated gene encoding the mature B. fragilis metallo-β-lactamase (amino acids 18–249) (13Rasmussen B.A. Guzman Y. Tally F.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 1590-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and synthesized on an EXPEDITE nucleic acid synthesizer (PerSpective Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA). The primers were used to amplify the truncated B. fragilis metallo-β-lactamase gene from pT7CcrANDE02 by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and subsequently ligated into the NcoI/BamHI site of the pET-27b(+) plasmid. The ligation product was then transformed into E. coli DH5α cells by electroporation, and plasmid minipreps were made using the Promega Wizard kit (Madison, WI). The sequences of the miniprep plasmids were checked using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) at the Penn State Nucleic Acid Facility. The one containing the correct truncated metallo-β-lactamase sequence, designated as pMSZ02, was subjected to a large scale plasmid preparation using the Qiagen plasmid purification kit from Qiagen, Inc. (Santa Clarita, CA) and used as the overexpression plasmid for the soluble B. fragilis metallo-β-lactamase. The overexpression plasmid, pMSZ02, was first transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by electroporation. A single colony from the transformed E. coli BL21(DE3, pMSZ02) plate was then used to inoculate 50 ml of LB medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin. After the cell preculture grew overnight at 37 °C, portions were diluted 1:100 into four 1-liter volumes of fresh LB medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The cell cultures were grown at 37 °C to an OD600nm of ∼0.6 and were subsequently cooled down in a 25 °C water bath for 15 min. The production of the metallo-β-lactamase was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the induced cell cultures were shaken at 25 °C for 18–20 h. The following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were removed by centrifugation (7000 rpm for 20 min), and the 4 liters of supernatant were concentrated to about 15 ml using two Minitan concentrators equipped with two 10,000 NMWL membranes each (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) followed by an Amicon YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The resulting solution was dialyzed against 3× l liter of 30 mm Tris-Cl, 100 μm Zn(II), pH 7.6 buffer during a 36-h period and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 30 min to remove any precipitate. The supernatant was then loaded onto a 30 × 200-mm Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) that had been equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-Cl, 100 μm Zn(II), pH 7.6 buffer. The column was eluted with a linear gradient formed by 500 ml of the starting buffer and 500 ml of 30 mm Tris-Cl, 100 μm Zn(II), 400 mm NaCl, pH 7.6 buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions containing the metallo-β-lactamase were combined and concentrated to about 10 ml using an Amicon concentrator with an YM-10 membrane. The product from the Q-Sepharose column was subsequently loaded onto a 30 × 700-mm Sephadex G-75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 30 mmTris-Cl, 100 μm Zn(II), pH 7.6 buffer for further purification. After loading, the column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The pure, active metallo-β-lactamase fractions were pooled and concentrated to a final volume of 6 ml with an Amicon YM-10 membrane. The protein solution was finally dialyzed against 4× 1 liter of metal-free, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6 buffer in a 96-h period to remove any adventitious metal ions. The purity of the enzyme was ascertained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bradford method) and/or ε280nm = 39,000m−1·cm−1. The metal content of the protein was determined using a Perkin-Elmer 730 atomic absorption spectrophotometer in the flame mode at the Penn State Materials Characterization Laboratory, and the reported values are the average of readings from at least three enzyme preps. Enzyme activity was determined in 1× MTEN buffer (50 mmMes, 2The abbreviations used are: Mes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidLMCTligand to metal charge transfer. 25 mm Tris, 25 mm ethanolamine, and 100 mm NaCl) at pH 7.0 and 25 °C using nitrocefin as substrate; the formation of the hydrolyzed nitrocefin was monitored and quantitated using Δε485nm = 15,600m−1·cm−1 (31O'Callaghan C.H. Morris A. Kirby S.M. Shingler A.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme can be stored at 4 °C for a week without losing any activity. It can also be stored in aliquots at −70 °C for a long period of time after flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid ligand to metal charge transfer. Apo-metallo-β-lactamase was prepared by dialyzing the Zn(II)-β-lactamase solution containing 0.3–0.5 mm protein against three changes of 150-fold volume excess of 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.6 buffer at 4 °C with a duration of 12 h for each dialysis. The chelating agent was then removed by extensive dialysis against eight changes of 150-fold volume excess of metal-free, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6 buffer at 4 °C. The obtained apoenzyme was subjected to metal analysis to ensure that it was metal-free. The apo-β-lactamase can be stored at −70 °C after flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Metal reconstitution studies were carried out by adding aliquots of the corresponding metal ion stock solution directly into the apoenzyme solution, mixing quickly, and incubating on ice for 30 min before assay. The enzymatic activities of the reconstituted enzyme were determined using nitrocefin as substrate (see above). The formation of Co(II)-substituted β-lactamase was also monitored spectroscopically. For the atomic absorption determination of the metal content of the Co(II)-reconstituted enzyme, the samples were made by adding a stoichiometric excess of Co(II) stock to the apoenzyme followed by dialysis against metal-free buffer to remove the unbound metal ion. EPR spectra of the Co(II)-substituted enzyme were collected on a Bruker ESR 300E spectrometer equipped with an Oxford ESR 900 continuous-flow cryostat and an Oxford model ITC4 temperature controller. Operating temperatures were read directly from the controller, which was calibrated with a carbon glass sensor. The buffer-subtracted EPR spectra were quantitated by double-integration of signal-averaged scans using a 0.5 mm CoCl2 standard solution as reference. Steady-state kinetic studies of the Zn(II)-β-lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitrocefin were conducted in 1× MTEN buffer from pH 5.25 to 10.0 at 25 °C (see above). TheKm and kcat values were derived from initial rate measurements using program Curve Fit 0.7e. The reaction rates at higher pH (≥7.5) were routinely corrected for background hydrolysis of the substrate. For solvent isotope effects, all the reactions were run in 1× MTEN buffers prepared in D2O with their pD values adjusted with KOD or DCl. Single-turnover experiments were carried out at pH 5.5, 7.0, and pD 7.0 on a SX.17MW stopped-flow system (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, United Kingdom) at 25 °C. The substrate disappearance and product formation were monitored as absorbance decrease at 390 nm and increase at 485 nm, respectively (31O'Callaghan C.H. Morris A. Kirby S.M. Shingler A.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). The absorbance changes were then corrected for an instrument dead time of 1.5 ms and converted into concentrations (32Lew J. Taylor S.S. Adam J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6717-6724Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The kinetic mechanism was simulated using the program KINSIM (Carl Frieden and Bruce Barshop, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) (33Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). B. fragilismetallo-β-lactamase is a secretory protein with its leader sequence comprising amino acid residues 1–17 (13Rasmussen B.A. Guzman Y. Tally F.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 1590-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 29Yang Y. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 1155-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our plan was to subclone the leaderless B. fragilis metallo-β-lactamase gene (encoding amino acids 18–249) into plasmid pET-27b(+) so that the truncated gene is fused with a pelB leader sequence under control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter. As a result, the overexpressed metallo-β-lactamase has the potential to be secreted into the periplasm in a soluble form. The construction of the expression plasmid, pMSZ02, is quite straightforward (SchemeFS1). To overexpress the metallo-β-lactamase, we first grew the pMSZ02-transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) strain in rich medium to the midlog phase (OD600nm = 0.6) at 37 °C. The cell culture was then cooled to 25 °C and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The induction was performed at 25 °C to avoid cell lysis (34Posner B. Lee I. Itoh T. Pyati T. Graff R. Thorton G.B. La Polla R. Benkovic S.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 128: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, very little soluble protein was found in the periplasmic space after induction; most appeared in the growth medium. The production of the soluble protein reaches a maximum after 18–20 h of induction and accounts for more than 90% of the total protein in the medium (Fig.1). The β-lactamase activity in the cell growth medium was monitored during the induction and found proportional to the level of the soluble enzyme produced (data not shown). The fact that the β-lactamase activity in the medium was inhibited by EDTA in a time-dependent fashion (data not shown) demonstrates that the soluble enzyme is indeed a metallo-β-lactamase. During the expression, large amounts of insoluble metallo-β-lactamase also accumulated in the cytoplasm.Figure 1Purification of the soluble B. fragilismetallo-β-lactamase. Lane 1, molecular weight standards; lane 2, concentrated growth medium from induced BL21(DE3, pMSZ02); lane 3, after dialysis into low salt buffer; lane 4, after chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column; lane 5, after chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The secretion of the enzyme into cell growth medium makes its purification relatively easy (Fig. 1). Minitan concentrators proved very efficient in concentrating the medium; four 10,000 NMWL membranes concentrated 4 liters of medium to 50 ml in about 6 h. After further concentration with an Amicon YM-10 membrane, the protein solution was dialyzed to adjust pH and to lower the salt concentration. A Q-Sepharose column was used to remove most of the positively charged components in the medium and the metallo-β-lactamase-containing fractions eluted using a linear salt gradient between 0.15 and 0.2m NaCl. Highly purified metallo-β-lactamase was obtained after a final Sephadex G-75 gel filtration column (Fig. 1). We have consistently isolated 80–100 mg of purified enzyme from 4 liters of cell culture. As expected, the purified soluble metallo-β-lactamase has a molecular mass of ∼26 kDa (Fig. 1). Atomic absorption measurements revealed that the soluble metallo-β-lactamase contained two Zn(II) ions per protein molecule (Table I), and no other metal ions were found in significant amounts (data not shown). With nitrocefin as the substrate, the soluble metallo-β-lactamase exhibited a Km value similar to that of the renatured enzyme that had been purified from urea-solubilized inclusion bodies (Table I). However, the specific activity of the soluble enzyme is much higher than that of the renatured enzyme; thekcat value of the soluble enzyme is higher than 200 s−1, whereas our best kcatvalue for the renatured enzyme is only 160 s−1 at pH 7.0 (Table I).Table IMetal contents and kinetic parameters for B. fragilis β-lactamaseEnzyme formMetal contentKMkcatμms−1Renatured Zn(II)-β-lactamase2.0 ± 0.3aZn(II) content.7.5 ± 0.7160.0 ± 2.5Renatured Co(II)-β-lactamase2.1 ± 0.4bCo(II) content.15.6 ± 1.041.7 ± 2.3Soluble Zn(II)-β-lactamase2.0 ± 0.2aZn(II) content.7.1 ± 0.7225.7 ± 5.6Soluble Co(II)-β-lactamase1.7 ± 0.2bCo(II) content.14.5 ± 2.1107.6 ± 4.7Assay condition: 1× MTEN, pH 7.0 buffer at 25 °C using nitrocefin as substrate.a Zn(II) content.b Co(II) content.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the soluble metallo-β-lactamase can be inactivated by Zn(II) chelating agents such as EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline in a time-dependent manner. Attempted preparation of the apoenzyme by dialyzing the purified Zn(II)-β-lactamase against 2 mm1,10-phenanthroline-containing buffer at pH 7.6 resulted in the precipitation of the protein. However, dialysis of the Zn(II)-β-lactamase against 10 mm EDTA-containing buffer followed by extensive dialysis against metal-free buffer to remove EDTA provided the apoenzyme with almost no activity (Fig.2). When increasing Zn(II) concentrations were added to the apoenzyme, the initial hydrolysis rate of nitrocefin markedly increased. About 80% of the enzymatic activity was restored after 1 equivalent of Zn(II) was introduced and full enzymatic activity recovered after 2 equivalents of Zn(II) were added to the apoenzyme (Fig. 2). This result reveals an important difference between the soluble enzyme and the renatured enzyme; the renatured enzyme cannot be reactivated by any metal ions after being treated with chelating agents (22Crowder M.W. Wang Z. Frankilin S.L. Zovinka E.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12126-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Co(II) can reactivate the apoenzyme with maximal activity reached at two equivalents (Fig. 2). However, the Co(II)-substituted enzyme possesses only half of the activity of the Zn(II) enzyme (Fig. 2 and Table I). Slight activity, approximately 4% and 8%, was restored with Cd(II) and Mn(II), respectively, but no activity was recovered by adding Ni(II) and Cu(II) to the apoprotein. Metal analysis confirmed the stoichiometric incorporation of Cd(II) and Mn(II) into the apoenzyme, whereas no bound metal ions were found in the Ni(II)- and Cu(II)-treated protein. Spectrophotometric titration of the apoenzyme with increments of Co(II), accompanied by scanning of the absorbance spectrum, confirmed that there are two Co(II) binding sites in"
https://openalex.org/W2158364267,"The transcriptionally active fragment of the yeast RNA polymerase II transcription elongation factor, TFIIS, comprises a three-helix bundle and a zinc ribbon motif joined by a linker region. We have probed the function of this fragment of TFIIS using structure-guided mutagenesis. The helix bundle domain binds RNA polymerase II with the same affinity as does the full-length TFIIS, and this interaction is mediated by a basic patch on the outer face of the third helix. TFIIS mutants that were unable to bind RNA polymerase II were inactive for transcription activity, confirming the central role of polymerase binding in the TFIIS mechanism of action. The linker and zinc ribbon regions play roles in promoting cleavage of the nascent transcript and read-through past the block to elongation. Mutation of three aromatic residues in the zinc ribbon domain (Phe269, Phe296, and Phe308) impaired both transcript cleavage and read-through. Mutations introduced in the linker region between residues 240 and 245 and between 250 and 255 also severely impaired both transcript cleavage and read-through activities. Our analysis suggests that the linker region of TFIIS probably adopts a critical structure in the context of the elongation complex."
https://openalex.org/W2013520997,"Vasopressin is the key regulator of water homeostasis in vertebrates. Central to its antidiuretic action in mammals is the redistribution of the water channel aquaporin 2 (AQP2) from intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane of kidney epithelial cells, an event initiated by an increase in cAMP and activation of protein kinase A. The subsequent steps of the signaling cascade are not known. To identify proteins involved in the AQP2 shuttle we exploited a recently developed cell line (CD8) derived from the rabbit cortical collecting duct and stably transfected with rat AQP2 cDNA. Treatment of CD8 cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) inhibited both the vasopressin-induced increase in water permeability and the redistribution of AQP2 from an intracellular compartment to the apical membrane. ADP-ribosylation studies revealed the presence of at least two major PTX substrates. Correspondingly, two α subunits of PTX-sensitive G proteins, Gαi2 and Gαi3, were identified by Western blotting. Introduction of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the Gi3 α subunit into permeabilized CD8 cells efficiently inhibited the cAMP-induced AQP2 translocation; a peptide corresponding to the α subunits of Gi1/2 was much less potent.

In principal cells, vasopressin activates basolaterally located V2 receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the cholera toxin-sensitive G protein Gs. The translocation of AQP2 is initiated by the hormone-induced rise in intracellular cAMP and the subsequent activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (3Nielsen S. Muller J. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F225-F238PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular events following this step, which eventually lead to the fusion of AQP2-bearing vesicles with the apical membrane, are not known. GTP-binding proteins of remarkable diversity are key components in the regulation of vesicle movement between compartments of the exocytic and endocytic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 4Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In particular, monomeric GTP-binding proteins of the Rab/YPT family have been assigned to various intracellular transport pathways (reviewed in Ref. 5Novick P. Brennwald P. Cell. 1993; 75: 597-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Rab3, a constituent of vesicles undergoing regulated excoytosis, has also been recently found in a kidney preparation enriched for AQP2-bearing vesicles (6Liebenhoff U. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); in further experiments the subtype has been determined as Rab 3a. 2U. Liebenhoff and W. Rosenthal, unpublished results. Heterotrimeric G proteins, traditionally thought to be transducer molecules confined to the plasma membrane, are also present on intracellular vesicles, and an increasing number of studies suggest that they participate in various intracellular transport pathways (reviewed in Refs. 7Helms J.B.

In secretory, e.g. insulin-secreting cells (reviewed in Ref.9Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar), PTX, by uncoupling G proteins of the Gi/Gofamily from activated receptors by ADP-ribosylation of their α subunits, inhibits regulated exocytosis independent of signaling events across the plasma membrane. To identify proteins involved in the AQP2 shuttle we exploited a recently developed cell line (CD8) (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol.

CD8 cells respond to vasopressin or forskolin with a 4–6-fold increase in the osmotic water permeability coefficient, Pf, and redistribution of AQP2 from an intracellular compartment to the apical membrane. Thus CD8 represent a unique model system, possessing the functional key properties of principal cells in situ. Here we show that a G protein of the Gi family is required for cAMP-triggered trafficking of AQP2. CD8 cells (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol.

Confluent monolayers were used at days 3–5 after plating. Cells grown on coverslips were incubated in the absence or presence of PTX (2 μg/ml, List Biological Laboratories) for 3 h at 37 °C and either stimulated with vasopressin or forskolin (15–20 min at 37 °C) or left under basal conditions. Thereafter, cells were prepared for TIR microfluorimetry or immunofluorescence microscopy. The osmotically induced cell volume changes in adherent cells were measured by TIR microfluorimetry (13Farinas J. Simanek V. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1613-1620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Application of the procedure to CD8 cells and calculation of Pfvalues have been described (10Valenti G. Frigeri A.

An affinity-purified antiserum (AS AQP2) raised against an AQP2 peptide has been characterized (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol.

A panel of rabbit antisera raised against synthetic peptides deduced from G protein subunits were employed: AS 8 raised against a peptide ((C)GAGESGKSTIVKQMK, Gαc) common to various G protein α subunits including Gs, Gi, Go, and Gt; AS 398 raised against a peptide ((C)TDDGMAVATGSWDDSFLKIWN, Gβc) common to G protein β subunits (subtypes 1–4); AS 6 (affinity-purified) raised against a peptide ((C)NLKEDGISAAKDVK, Gαo) specific for Go α subunits; AS 190 (affinity-purified) raised against a peptide (LDRIAQPNYI, Gαi1) specific for the Gi1 α subunit; AS 373 raised against a peptide (DVIIKNNLKDCGLF, Gαi1/2) specific for Gi1 and Gi2 α subunits; AS 269 raised against a peptide ((C)TGANKYDEAAS, Gαi2) specific for the Gi2α subunit; and AS 86 raised against a peptide (KNNLKECGLY, Gαi3) specific for the Gi3 α subunits. An N-terminal C (in parentheses) in the sequence indicates an additional C used for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Excepting antisera 190 and 373 the production of antisera and their specificity (as tested in Western blot and/or in immunoprecipitation experiments with recombinant G protein subunits) have been described (14Leopoldt D. Harteneck C. Nürnberg B. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. 1997; 356 (and references therein): 216-224Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Schmidt A. Hescheler J. Offermanns S. Spicher K.

In Western blot experiments AS 190 recognized specifically the Gi1 α subunit, and AS 373 recognized specifically Gi1 and Gi2 α subunits. The subunits recognized by the other antisera are mentioned under “Results.” Conventional immunofluorescence and video confocal microscopy (16Benedetti P.A. Evangelista V. Guidarini D. Vestri S. Zool. Studies. 1995; 34: 186-188Google Scholar, 17Benedetti P.A. Evangelista V. Guidarini D. Vestri S. SPIE—The International Society for Optical Engineering. 1995; 2412: 56-62Crossref Google Scholar) of CD8 cells grown on coverslips have been described (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C.

For video confocal microscopy, images were taken in thexy plane at steps of 320 nm, using an oil-immersion objective (40 × 1.40 normal aperture); xz sections were extracted from a set of planar images, the overall depth corresponding to about 6 μm. CD8 cells grown on coverslips were washed three times in “intracellular” (IC) buffer (140 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Permeabilization of cells was achieved using staphylococcal α toxin (18Ahnert-Hilger G. Mach W. Fohr K.J. Gratzl M. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 63-90CCrossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The permeabilization was monitored by the cellular uptake of carboxyfluorescein (1.24 mm). Conditions in which more than 95% of cells were rendered fluorescent were selected. As an additional control for permeabilization, cAMP, which is membrane-impermeable, was used to elicit redistribution of AQP2 (see below). Cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of α toxin in IC buffer devoid of peptides (control) or in IC buffer supplemented with peptides corresponding to the C termini of G protein α subunits (19Aridor M. Rajmilevich G. Beaven M.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. Science. 1993; 262 (and references therein): 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thereafter, cells were washed three times in IC buffer and either incubated with 10 mm cAMP for 10 min at 37 °C or left under basal condition, fixed and immunostained with AS AQP2 (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (; Correction (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26794): 24365-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition to the Gαi1/2 and Gαi3 peptides (see above), a peptide (YLGLEKLNNK) with a reversed sequence with respect to the Gαi3 peptide was employed. To quantify the effect of different peptides on cAMP-induced AQP2 redistribution in CD8 cells, AQP2 immunofluorescence intensity was analyzed in different experimental conditions. Briefly, planar images obtained by conventional immunofluorescence were analyzed using the Image Tool software which assigns to the brightest fluorescence detectable in the image a score of 255 and to the least fluorescence detectable a value of 1. All images had exactly the same pixel number in order to determine differences in the distribution of fluorescence between the different experimental groups. At least four randomly chosen boxes from different fields of the coverslips (corresponding to approximately 20 cells each) were analyzed from at least three separate experiments. Background fluorescence was measured and normalized. Images were processed, and the distribution of pixel intensity as a function of their frequency was determined for each image and relative parameters as standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis were determined. Skewness is a measure of the symmetry of a profile about the mean pixel intensity value. Kurtosis describes the randomness of the shape of the profile relative to that of a perfectly random pixel intensity distribution. Statistical analyses were performed using the unpairedt test. Homogenates were prepared as described previously (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (; Correction (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26794): 24365-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the preparation of crude membranes, cell monolayers were trypsinized, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer in ice-cold buffer H (300 mm mannitol, 12 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4). The suspension was centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 15 min, and the pellet containing nuclei and unbroken cells was discarded. The supernatant was spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant and the homogenized pellet were recombined, centrifuged at 100,000 gfor 60 min, and the pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Crude membranes from rat kidney papilla or rabbit brain were prepared by cutting the tissues into small slices and homogenizing them in ice-cold buffer H. For the preparation of crude membranes, the resulting suspension was subjected to the protocol described above. For the preparation of high speed pellet (HSP) from rabbit kidney papilla, the papillae were excised and homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer in ice-cold buffer H. The suspension was centrifuged at 700 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was spun at 200,000 × g in a Beckman Rotor 60 Ti for 60 min at 4 °C. The final pellet (HSP) enriched in intracellular vesicles, was recovered in buffer H and used for immunoblot experiments. Endosomes were prepared from rat kidney papillae or CD8 cells according to Sabolic et al. (20Sabolic I. Wuarin F. Shi L-B. Verkman A.S. Ausiello D.A. Gluck S. Brown D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the kidney papillae from six rats were excised and cut into small pieces. These pieces or CD8 cells from confluent monolayers grown in six 175-cm2 culture flasks were homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer in ice-cold buffer H. The suspension was centrifuged at 2,500 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The obtained supernatant and the upper part of the pellet were centrifuged at 45,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was recovered, resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer H, homogenized with a manual glass Potter, loaded on an 18% Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. The opalescent part of the gradient located in the bottom third of the gradient was recovered, resuspended in KCl buffer (300 mm mannitol, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 15 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.0), and centrifuged at 45,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing AQP2-enriched vesicles was recovered in buffer H. PTX-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of proteins and analysis of radiolabeled proteins were carried out as described previously (15Schmidt A. Hescheler J. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Hinsch K-D.

Western blotting was performed as described elsewhere (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (; Correction (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26794): 24365-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) except that proteins were separated by 10% SDS gels in the presence of 1 m urea. Filters were incubated with primary antibodies diluted as indicated and thereafter with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, Sigma). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by a color reaction (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (; Correction (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26794): 24365-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To test whether G proteins are involved in the AQP2 redistribution downstream of the cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase signal, we treated CD8 cells with PTX which ADP-ribosylates and thereby uncouples G proteins of the Gi and Go types from their cognate receptors. The time course of cell swelling in response to changes in perfusate osmolality was measured by TIR microfluorimetry (Fig.1; see “Experimental Procedures”). In control cells, forskolin, a strong direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, accelerated cell swelling in response to a decrease in perfusate osmolality by 200 mm (Fig. 1 A); it also increased the extent of swelling in the observed time interval (45 s). The change in fluorescence caused by forskolin corresponds to an about 5-fold increase in the Pf (Fig.1 C). When cells had been treated with PTX, the time course of cell swelling (Fig. 1 B) and water permeability (Fig. 1 C) were not modified by forskolin. The data suggest that PTX either inhibits AQP2 trafficking or impairs AQP2 function. To differentiate between these possibilities we examined the effect of PTX on the vasopressin-induced redistribution of AQP2 (Fig.2). Control or PTX-treated CD8 cells grown on coverslips were fixed, immunostained with AS AQP2 (for Western blot analysis of CD8 cells with the same antiserum, see Fig. 7), and examined by video confocal microscopy (see “Experimental Procedures”). In control cells under resting conditions, both intracellular and apical plasma membrane staining was observed; stimulation of cells with vasopressin resulted in an increased staining to the apical membrane and an increase in cell height (Fig. 2,upper panel) (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (; Correction (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26794): 24365-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After treatment with PTX, vasopressin failed to induce a redistribution (Fig. 2, lower panel). Similar data were obtained when forskolin was used instead of vasopressin (not shown) (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (; Correction (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26794): 24365-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These findings fully explain the lack of a functional response in PTX-treated cells and show that a PTX substrate is required for the cAMP-induced redistribution of AQP2.Figure 7Detection of AQP2, G protein α and β subunits in CD8 cells, rabbit and rat kidney papilla/medulla, and rabbit brain. Onto each lane of an SDS gel, 60 μg of protein were loaded. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto membranes, which were incubated with the primary antipeptide antisera indicated on the bottom right of each panel. The AQP2 antiserum and AS 190 (Gαi1) were subjected to affinity chromatography prior to use. The dilutions of the other antisera were 1:5000. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by a color reaction. Molecular masses are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further experiments were performed to identify the PTX substrates involved in AQP2 trafficking. Fractions from CD8 cells (total cell homogenate, crude membranes and a fraction enriched for AQP2-bearing vesicles traditionally termed endosomes; see “Experimental Procedures”) were incubated with [32P]NAD in the absence or presence of PTX, and [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins were analyzed by high resolution SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography (Fig. 3). In brain membranes, a rich source for PTX-sensitive G proteins of the Gi and Go families, a strong signal was detected at 39–45 kDa. Among the various preparations of CD8 cells the strongest signal was observed in the endosome fraction. Whereas a weak signal was seen in the homogenate, apparently two major substrates were found in the 43-kDa region in the crude membrane and endosome preparations. As shown below, the PTX substrates in CD8 cells correspond to α subunits of the Gi family. The relatively high apparent molecular masses of PTX substrates (Gi/Go α subunits) are due to the presence of 6 m urea during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15Schmidt A. Hescheler J. Offermanns S. Spicher K. Hinsch K-D. Klinz F-J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Gausepohl H. Frank R. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18025-18033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine functionally the involvement of G proteins in the regulation of AQP2 trafficking, we permeabilized CD8 cells with α toxin as described previously (18Ahnert-Hilger G. Mach W. Fohr K.J.

The holes formed by the toxin (2–3 nm in diameter) allow the introduction of small molecules such as peptides into the interior of cells. Control experiments were carried out to determine the appropriate concentration of the toxin which allowed the permeabilization without loss of cellular responsiveness to cAMP in terms of AQP2 redistribution (see “Experimental Procedures”). Permeabilized CD8 cells were exposed to peptides, stimulated with cAMP, fixed, immunostained with AS AQP2, and analyzed by video confocal microscopy (Fig. 4). The Gαi1/2 and Gαi3 peptides employed (see “Experimental Procedures”) corresponded to the C-terminal domains of human Gi1/2 and Gi3 α subunits, respectively, and include the cysteine residue modified by PTX. Previous studies have shown that peptides corresponding to the C termini of α subunits inhibit coupling of G proteins to their cognate receptors (19Aridor M. Rajmilevich G. Beaven M.A. Sagi-Eisenberg R. Science. 1993; 262 (and references therein): 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In the basal state (Fig. 4; −cAMP), permeabilized CD8 cells showed a diffuse distribution of AQP2. After stimulation with cAMP a marked increase in apical staining was seen in cells incubated in the absence of peptides, in the presence of the Gαi1/2peptide (100 μg/ml), and in the presence of a peptide (100 μg/ml) with the composition of the Gαi3 peptide but a reversed sequence. In contrast, diffuse intracellular staining, similar to that in nonstimulated cells, was observed in the presence of the Gαi3 peptide (100 μg/ml). The data indicate that the Gαi3 peptide inhibits the cAMP-induced redistribution of AQP2. To quantify the effect of different peptides, we next applied image analysis methods based on AQP2 signal intensity in CD8 cells. Cells were stained with AS AQP2 under different experimental conditions, and planar images, obtained by conventional immunofluorescence microscopy, were analyzed using the Image Tool software that assigns to the brightest fluorescence detectable in the image a score of 255 and to the least fluorescence detectable a value of 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 5. Under basal conditions, a punctate intracellular AQP2 staining is visible. As previously shown (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (; Correction (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26794): 24365-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), addition of vasopressin causes the disappearance of intracellular staining because of the redistribution of AQP2 in the apical membrane; forskolin has a similar effect (not shown). The relative pixel intensity plotted as a function of their frequency (lower panels) is substantially different under nonstimulated and stimulated conditions. Whereas a random pixel intensity distribution characterizes the basal condition, most of the pixels are in a narrow range of a low intensity gray scale under stimulated conditions. Using these tools, we evaluated quantitatively the effects of each peptide at different concentrations on cAMP-induced AQP2 redistribution. To this end, quantitative image features, skewness and kurtosis, were derived from automated analysis of digitized planar images. The two parameters were calculated for at least three independent experiments. For each experiment, at least four images were obtained from different fields of the coverslips (see “Experimental Procedures”). In nonstimulated permeabilized cells kurtosis and skewness were 3.4 ± 0.3 and 2.1 ± 0.05 (mean values ± S.D.; n = 4), respectively. The coefficients obtained with cAMP-stimulated CD8 cells were 20.35 ± 1.05 (kurtosis) and 4.55 ± 0.09 (skewness). A representative experiment performed with cAMP-stimulated cells is shown in Fig.6. The coefficient values for cells incubated with cAMP and the Gαi1/2 peptide at concentrations up to 100 μg/ml did not significantly differ from those obtained for cAMP-stimulated cells receiving the same concentrations of the irrelevant peptide or no peptide. Only at a concentration of 200 μg/ml of the Gαi1/2 peptide were the two coefficients significantly lowered (p < 0.05). In contrast, the Gαi3 peptide highly significantly (p < 0.0001) decreased both coefficients in cAMP-stimulated cells at all concentrations tested (50, 100, and 200 μg/ml). Interestingly, the values for kurtosis and skewness in nonstimuated cells (see above) were nonsignificantly different from those obtained with cAMP-stimulated cells incubated with the Gαi3 peptide at concentrations of 100 μg/ml (kurtosis, 3.7 ± 0.60; skewness, 2.2 ± 0.06) or 200 μg/ml (kurtosis, 3.2 ± 0.70; skewness, 2.2 ± 0.16). The data suggest a complete block of AQP2 translocation by the Gαi3 peptide used at concentrations ≥100 μg/ml. For cells incubated with the Gαi3 peptide at 50 μg/ml, kurtosis and skewness differed, however, significantly from those found for unstimulated cells (p < 0.005 and p < 0.01, respectively). As a next step, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of G protein subunits in CD8 cells by performing Western blot experiments with a panel of anti-peptide antibodies. In contrast to Fig. 3, SDS gels with 1 m urea were used to separate proteins prior to blotting (Fig.7). In some panels, an immunoreactive band at ≥42 kDa is visible in the membrane preparation from rabbit kidney enriched in endosomes (HSP). Further analysis revealed that this signal was entirely due to an unspecific staining by a batch of secondary antibodies; it was not observed in the absence of primary antibodies. AS AQP2 (AQP2 in Fig. 7) was used to estimate AQP2 levels in the different preparations. As described elsewhere (10Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (; Correction (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26794): 24365-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the antiserum detects the nonglycosylated and glycosylated forms of rat AQP2 at 29–30 and 35–45 kDa, respectively. The AQP2 signal was strongest in the endosome fractions either from CD8 cells, which overexpress rat AQP2, or from rat kidney.

These membrane association/dissociation are tightly controlled by regulatory proteins.

Rab proteins constitute the largest family (more than 36 members) of the Ras-related small GTPase superfamily. They bind both GDP/GTP and can hydrolyze GTP. Given their specific location in different cellular compartments and their implication in the regulation of specific membrane transport events, the Rab proteins have been proposed to be required for each step of membrane trafficking (1Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The Rab activity seems to be necessary for the formation of a complex between vesicle SNAREs and their cognate target SNAREs, which control the docking of transport vesicle with the target membranes (2Sogaard M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A fruitful approach to understand the mechanism of action of Rab proteins is the identification of their interacting proteins. Several putative effectors interacting with the GTP-bound form of Rab proteins have been identified. Strikingly, these proteins are structurally distinct from each other and are implicated in various cellular processes. This led to the suggestion that Rab proteins control several distinct activities including vesicle movement via kinesin motors (6Echard A. Jollivet F. Martinez O. Lacapere J.J. Rousselet A.

In the cytosol, many Rab proteins have been found complexed to Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). 1The abbreviations used are: GDIGDP dissociation inhibitorPDEphosphodiesteraseVSVvesicular stomatitis virusPAGEpolyacrylmide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate).1The abbreviations used are: GDIGDP dissociation inhibitorPDEphosphodiesteraseVSVvesicular stomatitis virusPAGEpolyacrylmide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Rab GDI has the ability to retrieve the GDP-Rab proteins from membranes (10Araki S. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Hata Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell.

Additional factors such GDI displacement factor are required to mediate the release of GDI from the Rab-GDI complex and the membrane recruitment of Rab proteins (14Dirac S.A. Sumizawa T. Pfeffer S.R.

This step seems to be coupled by the exchange of GDP for GTP catalyzed by a guanine exchange Factor (16Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol.

These factors play an essential role in the association/dissociation of Rab proteins from the membranes and are important elements regulating their multifaceted biological functions.

We have shown that the small GTPase Rab13, associated with vesicles in fibroblasts, is mainly accumulated in tight junctions of polarized epithelial cells. Moreover, this distribution depends upon the integrity of tight junctions which are found in simple epithelia as well as in endothelia. We have proposed that Rab13 may be involved either in the targeting of a subset of membrane proteins destined to the apical or basolateral surfaces and/or in the regulation of the barrier function of tight junctions (18Zahraoui A. Joberty G. Arpin M. Fontaine J.J. Hellio R. Tavitian A. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To elucidate further the function of Rab13, we have searched for proteins able to interact with Rab13. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen and Rab13 wild type, we isolated a cDNA encoding a protein of 17.4 kDa, δ-PDE. We found that this protein interacts with the isoprenylated form of Rab13. Immunofluorescence data suggest that the VSV-G protein- tagged δ-PDE is localized in vesicular structures near the plasma membrane in epithelial cells. We also present evidence that δ-PDE, but not Rab GDI, has the capacity to extract the Rab13 protein from cellular membranes. These findings raise the possibility that this protein is involved in the dissociation and recycling of Rab13 protein from its target membranes. The yeast two-hybrid system used in this study has been already described (19Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Camonis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22473-22477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, we have used the plasmid pLEX10 to generate a fusion protein between LexA DNA binding domain and wild type Rab13. LexA Rab13 fusion protein expression was checked by Western blot with anti-Rab13 antibodies. This construct was used to screen a HeLa cDNA library fused to Gal4 activation domain, pGAD (19Boldin M.P.

Both constructs, LexA Rab13 and pGAD cDNAs, were co-transformed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 strain by the lithium acetate method. Transformants were plated on selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine for selection of His+ colonies. Determination of β-galactosidase activity was performed on patches from selective medium minus Trp/Leu/His plates by filter assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside as a substrate. Library positive clones from transformed yeast were recovered as described previously (20Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitian A. Gacon G. Camonis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22473-22477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). All point mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction and checked by sequencing. Rab6 wild type, T27N, and Q67L were gifts from Dr. B. Goud (Institut Curie, Paris, France). A filter containing mRNA from human tissues, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon (mucosal lining), and peripheral blood (leukocytes) were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The human δ-PDE cDNA probe was synthetized using the random priming procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 42 °C as described in the GeneScreen instruction manual (NEN Life Science Products). The filter was washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C and autoradiographed. The human δ-PDE cDNA coding region was inserted into Escherichia coli expression vector pET-15b and expressed as a histidine-δ-PDE fusion protein. The protein was then produced and purified on Ni2+-agarose beads by classical methods. Rab13 and Rab3A cDNAs were cloned in pCR3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) under the control of a T7 promoter. Transcription and translation in the presence of [S35]methionine were performed in vitro using the TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). This system has been reported to contain a variety of post-translational processes including isoprenylation (21Kinsella B.T. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3940-3945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rab13 and Rab3A, translated in vitro in the presence of [S35]methionine, were incubated with His-δ-PDE fusion protein immobilized onto Ni2+ beads for 16 h at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Pefabloc, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The beads were washed five times with the same buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Bioch. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar) and autoradiography. The proximal tubule cells of pig kidney, LLC-PK1, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C under a 10% CO2atmosphere. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (P5D4) raised against the VSV-G protein tag were previously described (23Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Secondary Cy2-labeled anti-mouse was purchased from Jackson (West Groove, PA). The human δ-PDE cDNA coding region or a truncated form of δ-PDE1–143 (amino acids 1–143) were tagged at their N terminus with an oligonucleotide encoding the C-terminal 11 amino acids of the VSV-G protein. The constructs, verified by sequencing, were then cloned into pCB6 vector and transfected into LLC-PK1 cells using the Lipofectin reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2. Cells were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and washed, and free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 15 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and washed with 1% Triton, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. All subsequent incubations with antibodies and washes were performed in this buffer. Cells were stained with the mouse monoclonal anti-VSV-G protein tag antibody. After rinsing three times for 10 min, the primary antibody was visualized with goat Cy2 anti-mouse immunoglobulins. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed with a Leica TLS confocal microscope. Six horizontal sections, taken at 0.8 μm from the base of the cells, were obtained to generate the images showing the distribution of the ectopically expressed VSV-δ-PDE. Cells, scraped from plastic tissue culture dishes with a rubber policeman, were homogenized on ice in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mm Pefabloc). After centrifugation at 600 ×g for 10 min to remove nuclei, the supernatant was centrifuged at 430,000 × g in Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge for 30 min to generate a cytosol fraction and a crude membrane fraction. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay system. Rab13 protein was solubilized from cellular membranes as described previously (11Soldati T. Riederer M.A. Pfeffer S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The pellet (100 μg of total cellular membranes) was incubated in 25 mm Hepes, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 msucrose, 0.5 mm ATP, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (see above) for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence or absence of either 1 mm GDP or GTPγS. After addition of purified recombinant human δ-PDE, membranes were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then separated into membrane and soluble fractions by centrifugation at 430,000 × g in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-Rab13, anti-Rab4, and anti-Rab6 antibodies. After blotting, the solubilized Rab13 protein bands were quantified using ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed using Sigma Plot (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The experiments with Rab GDI were performed as indicated above, except that the membranes (100 μg) were preloaded with 1 mm GDP for 1 h at 30 °C prior to addition of purified Rab GDI α or β isoforms. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to search for proteins interacting with wild type Rab13. Rab13 wild type in frame with LexA DNA binding domain was used to screen 3 × 106 clones from a HeLa cDNA library fused to a Gal4 activation domain. Several cDNAs activating the expression of both the selection marker His3 and the LacZ reporter gene were isolated. A second round of screening yielded eight clones that interact with Rab13 wild type, but not with lamin used as a negative control. The analysis of these clones revealed that they encoded the same protein. The largest cDNA clone obtained by the two-hybrid screen was sequenced. It encoded a protein of 150 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.4 kDa. This protein, 98% identical to the bovine δ-PDE (24Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was named human δ-PDE. We then checked the specificity of the interaction of δ-PDE and found that it did not interact, in the yeast two-hybrid assay, with Rab8 wild type, Rab6 wild type, or T27N or Q72L mutants. Based on sequence similarity with Ras proteins, two Rab13 mutants, T22N and Q67L, expected to lock the protein in either GDP or GTP state, respectively, were tested for their ability to interact with δ-PDE. We found that both Rab13 mutants interacted with δ-PDE. In addition, Rab13ΔCSLG, a Rab13 mutant lacking the C-terminal CAAX box required for its geranylgeranylation (25Joberty G. Tavitian A. Zahraoui A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), is not able to interact with δ-PDE. This indicated that the isoprenylation of Rab13 is required for its interaction with δ-PDE (Fig.1 A). Further two-hybrid dissections demonstrated that the 40 N-terminal residues of δ-PDE are important for its interaction with Rab13 (not shown). To confirm that the human δ-PDE interacts with Rab13, we also studied it by in vitro binding assay. Since rabbit reticulocyte lysate supports the post-translational geranylgeranylation of Rab proteins that is required for membrane association (13Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kinsella B.T. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3940-3945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated Rab13. The δ-PDE was expressed as a His-δ-PDE fusion protein. The protein was purified, immobilized on Ni2+ beads, and incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled Rab13 or Rab3A. Rab13, but not Rab3A, protein bound to δ-PDE immobilized on Ni2+ beads. The in vitro translated Rab13 appeared as a doublet of 25 and 16 kDa. Both protein bands fractionated into the detergent phase with Triton X-114, suggesting that they are isoprenylated (not shown). Therefore, the truncated form of Rab13 might result from a degradation or could be generated from an internal initiation site at methionine 82. We observed that both bands interact with δ-PDE, the shorter band binds more efficiently. Rab13 did not bind to Ni2+ beads alone (Fig. 1 B). These results confirm those of the two-hybrid assay. When used as a hybridization probe in Northern blot, the cDNA clone detects one transcript of 1 kilobase expressed in several tissues such as spleen, prostate gland, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood (Fig. 2). The sequence of human δ-PDE was compared with protein sequences in the data bases using BLAST and FASTA software (Fig. 3). The human δ-PDE protein shares 70% identity with a Caenorhabditis elegans putative protein (C27H5; accession no. g540267), suggesting that it may be highly conserved during evolution. The C terminus of the δ-PDE contains putative SRV and FYV sequence motifs described as necessary and sufficient for the interaction with PDZ domains present in many proteins of synaptic, septate, and tight junctions (PSD95, Dlg, ZO-1). PDZ domains are involved in submembranous protein networks and in the recruitment of proteins to specific plasma membrane microdomains (26Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 27Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of δ-PDE is consistent with a molecule that may interact with membrane proteins. The bovine δ-PDE has been shown to solubilize membrane-bound retinal rod phosphodiesterase α and β subunits (24Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We tested whether purified human δ-PDE had the capacity to retrieve Rab13 from membranes. Total cellular membranes were incubated with increasing amounts of purified recombinant human δ-PDE and centrifuged to separate membranes from supernatant. The supernatant fractions were then analyzed by blotting with anti-Rab13 antibodies to determine the effect of δ-PDE on membrane-bound Rab13. Rab4 and Rab6 distribution were also examined in the same fractions to test the functional specificity of δ-PDE. As shown in Fig.4, in the absence of δ-PDE, Rab13 remained predominantly membrane-associated. Importantly, upon addition of δ-PDE, Rab13 was extracted from cellular membranes. A large amount, 50–60%, of Rab13 could be recovered in the supernatant when membranes were preincubated with an excess of GDP and GTP prior to addition of δ-PDE (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the solubilization of Rab13 occurred in a dose-dependent manner with increasing amounts of purified δ-PDE. In contrast, Rab4 and Rab6 were not released from the membranes upon addition of δ-PDE (Fig.4 B), suggesting that the effect of δ-PDE is specific for Rab13. The δ-PDE solubilization property resembled, to some extent, that of Rab GDI. Several Rab GDI isoforms with no remarkable functional differences have been identified. All have been shown able to dissociate many geranylgeranyl GDP bound forms of Rab proteins from membranes (10Araki S. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Hata Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14801-14808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We tested whether the Rab GDI β isoform has the capacity to solubilize Rab13 from membranes. In these experiments, membranes were incubated with an excess of GDP to allow the exchange of these nucleotides for already bound nucleotides prior to addition of the purified Rab GDI β isoform. We found that Rab13 remained in the membrane fraction and cannot be recovered in the supernatant upon addition of the GDI β isoform. In contrast, GDI β isoform successfully released Rab4 and Rab6 from membranes (Fig.4 C). Similar results were obtained with the Rab GDI α isoform (not shown). These results indicate that δ-PDE, but not Rab GDI, is capable of dissociating Rab13 from the membranes. Given the effect of δ-PDE on the membrane dissociation of Rab13 protein, we next asked whether a fraction of δ-PDE could be detected as a membrane-bound form. We transiently overproduced the human δ-PDE tagged with the VSV-G protein epitope at the N terminus (VSV-δ-PDE) in the epithelial cell line LLC-PK1. We performed a Western blot analysis on cytosol and membrane fractions from the transfected LLC-PK1 cells. While the majority of the VSV-δ-PDE is found in the cytosol, 12% of total VSV-δ-PDE is detected in the membrane fraction (Fig.5). We then determined the membrane localization of the VSV-δ-PDE by immunofluorescence microscopy. Subconfluent VSV-δ-PDE-transfected LLC-PK1 cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and stained with anti-VSV antibody. The subcellular distribution of VSV-δ-PDE was analyzed by confocal laser microscopy. The cells that highly overproduced VSV-δ-PDE showed a cytoplasmic staining as expected for a protein mainly cytosolic. However, most strikingly, The VSV-δ-PDE exhibited a patchy staining pattern outlining the periphery of the cells (Fig.6 A). Our immunofluorescence observations suggest that VSV-δ-PDE may be localized in vesicular structures in close contact with the lateral plasma membrane domains of these epithelial cells.Figure 6Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showing the distribution of the VSV-G tagged δ-PDE protein in epithelial LLC-PK1 cells. The VSV-G epitope tag was inserted at the N terminus of δ-PDE. A, VSV-δ-PDE protein or B, VSV-δ-PDE truncated at Arg144 (VSV-δ-PDE1–143) were transiently overproduced in the epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 by transfection. 16 h later, cells were processed for immunofluorescence as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.”A and B, VSV-δ-PDE immunoreactivity was detected using the mouse monoclonal anti-VSV antibody and Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies. Six horizontal sections (taken at 0.8 mm from the base of the cells) were obtained to generate the image disclosing the distribution of VSV-δ-PDE. Note that, in one transfected cell, VSV-δ-PDE is so overexpressed that cytosolic staining is also seen.

Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W. Sudhof T.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Consequently, the C-terminal region was suspected to be required for VSV-δ-PDE membrane location. Thus, we examined, by immunofluorescence, whether VSV-δ-PDE lacking the last C-terminal 7 residues encompassing FYV and SRV sequences (VSV-δ-PDE1–143) could localize to vesicular structures near the plasma membrane. VSV-δ-PDE1–143 transfected LLC-PK1 cells were stained for VSV-δ-PDE1–143. In contrast to the tagged wild type protein, the VSV-δ-PDE1–143 labeling appeared diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. Strikingly, no patchy staining outlining the cell borders could be detected (Fig. 6 B). These data strongly suggested that FYV and SRV motifs are required for the localization of the VSV-δ-PDE. Using the yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding a human δ-PDE protein that is able to bind to the small GTPase Rab13 and not to Rab6 or Rab8. Further dissections of this two-hybrid interaction revealed that the C-terminal CAAX(CSLG) box is required for δ-PDE-Rab13 interaction. The Rab13 CSLG motif has been shown to be necessary for the post-translational geranylgeranylation of the protein (25Joberty G. Tavitian A. Zahraoui A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We then analyzed the binding of Rab13 to immobilized δ-PDE, and found that Rab13 bound to δ-PDE. Thus, there appears to be a specific interaction of δ-PDE with Rab13. However, our results do not exclude the possible interaction of δ-PDE with Rab13 via bridging proteins such PDE α and β subunits that could be present in yeast as well as in the reticulocyte lysate. A computer homology search revealed that the amino acid sequence of the human δ-PDE was almost identical to that of bovine δ-PDE protein. The bovine δ-PDE protein was first found as a protein that co-purified with the rod-soluble PDE α and β subunits in the retina. However, this protein has no regulatory effect on the activity of the rod PDE involved in phototransduction in the retina (24Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to the rod PDE, δ-PDE mRNA expression was detected in large variety of tissues. These observations strengthen the idea that δ-PDE may interact with other proteins than rod PDE (24Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (this work). It is striking to notice that δ-PDE is highly conserved from C. elegans to human (75% identity), suggesting a conserved function during evolution. Many of the PDZ domain-containing proteins are localized at specific regions of cell-cell contacts. In general, the PDZ domains interact preferentially with C-terminal hydrophobic peptide sequences including S/TXV, YYV, and FYV (31Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of δ-PDE contains SRV and FYV sequences that conform to the PDZ binding motifs. This suggests that δ-PDE is a candidate for the interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins. Deletion of the RVGLFYV C terminus amino acid sequence abolishes the distribution of the VSV-δ-PDE-containing vesicles along the plasma membrane. This indicates that the sequence encompassing SRV and FYV motifs play a key role in targeting the VSV-δ-PDE to a peripheral vesicular compartment. We have determined the intracellular distribution of the δ-PDE protein through transient transfection of epitope-tagged constructs. However, to reduce the possibility of mislocalization due to overexpression, we based our conclusions on cells that express a relatively low level of the ectopically expressed VSV-δ-PDE. A specific antibody recognizing the δ-PDE will be needed to precisely define the subcellular location of the endogenous protein. In order to generate and maintain surface polarity, epithelial cells have to target proteins and lipids to both apical and basolateral membranes. Indeed, it has been proposed that the junctional complexes may contain the machinery required for docking and fusion of vesicles (32Louvard D. Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4132-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that several small GTPases, such as Rab13, Rab8, and Rab3B may be involved in the delivery of transport vesicles to the plasma membrane or to specialized plasma membrane microdomains (18Zahraoui A. Joberty G. Arpin M. Fontaine J.J. Hellio R. Tavitian A. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 33Huber L. Pimplikar S. Parton R.G. Virta H. Zerial M.

Kirk K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The interaction of δ-PDE with Rab13 and the subcellular distribution of the ectopically expressed VSV-tagged protein are consistent with a post Golgi/plasma membrane function. The immunofluorescence data showed a significant fraction of VSV-δ-PDE associated with vesicular structures near the plasma membrane. However, whether this fraction of VSV-δ-PDE is associated with vesicles that have accumulated in the vicinity of the lateral membrane (including intercellular junctions) has not been determined. This VSV-δ-PDE membranous pool could be associated at sites of vesicles docking with target membranes to efficiently retrieve Rab13 protein from membranes. A functional model for Rab proteins has been proposed (1Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rab proteins associate with transport vesicle from the donor membrane, the vesicle moves to, docks, and fuses with the acceptor membrane. Upon GTP hydrolysis, Rab proteins are recycled back to the donor compartment via a cytosolic intermediate. The model requires the presence of multiple factors that regulate the association of Rab proteins with the membrane as well as their release into the cytosol. So far, it has been shown that Rab GDI may account for the recycling of Rab proteins to the cytosol. Intriguingly, Rab GDI is not able to retrieve Rab13 from the membranes. We tested whether δ-PDE is capable of solubilizing the membrane-bound Rab13. The results presented indicate that a large fraction (50–60%) of Rab13 can be recovered in the supernatant upon addition of δ-PDE. The release of Rab13 into the supernatant was dependent upon the concentration of δ-PDE. About 50% of the Rab13 could not be removed from the membranes due probably to the association of a fraction of membranous Rab13 with other molecules that prevent the interaction with δ-PDE. It is also possible that only a fraction of membranous Rab13 is accessible in our assay. The δ-PDE was not able to solubilize Rab4 and Rab6 from the membranes, confirming the specific binding of δ-PDE to Rab13. Thus, δ-PDE, dissociating Rab13 bound to GTP or GDP, may allow transit of Rab13 between the physically separated effector and activator. δ-PDE has also been shown to solubilize the membrane- bound rod PDE. Similarly to Rab13, δ-PDE/PDE interaction requires isoprenylation and/or a C-terminal domain of either or both PDE α and β subunits. Thus, it has been suggested that δ-PDE may recognize the isoprenylated C terminus to bind to the target proteins (24Florio S.K. Prusti R.K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24036-24047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal regions of Rab13 and PDE α and β subunits are divergent. Therefore, we propose that the binding of δ-PDE to their targets requires (i) targeting of δ-PDE to a specialized membrane microdomain through interaction with membrane proteins, and (ii) recognition of the isoprenylated C terminus. Taken together, our results show that δ-PDE may dissociate the Rab13 protein from the membranes, allowing its release into the cytosol. They also suggest that the mechanisms controlling the dissociation of Rab proteins from the membranes can be diverse and may imply the interference of distinct proteins. We are indebted to Dr. J. Camonis for the generous gift of the two-hybrid cDNA library and plasmids, to Drs. F. Possmayer and B. Goud for the Rab GDI β isoform. We thank Drs. M. Arpin, R. Golsteyn, and B.

https://openalex.org/W2094687612,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the low molecular weight acyl carrier protein (ACP) of mitochondrial type II fatty acid synthase (FAS) and the cytoplasmic type I FAS multienzyme contain 4′-phosphopantetheine as a prosthetic group. Sequence alignment studies with the recently isolated phosphopantetheine:protein transferase (PPTase), Ppt1p, from Brevibacterium ammoniagenes revealed the yeast open reading frame, YPL148C, as a potential PPTase gene (25% identical and 43% conserved amino acids). In accordance with this similarity, pantetheinylation of mitochondrial ACP was lost upon disruption of YPL148C. In contrast, biosynthesis of cytoplasmic holo-FAS remained unaffected by this mutation. According to these characteristics, the newly identified gene was designated asPPT2. Similar to ACP null mutants, cellular lipoic acid synthesis and, hence, respiration were abolished in PPT2deletants. ACP pantetheinylation, lipoic acid synthesis, and respiratory competence were restored upon transformation ofPPT2 mutants with cloned PPT2 DNA. In vitro, holo-ACP synthesis was achieved by incubating apo-ACP with coenzyme A in the presence of purified Ppt2p. The homologous yeast enzyme could be replaced, in this assay, by the ACP synthase (EC2.7.8.7) of Escherichia coli but not by the type I FAS-specific PPTase of B. ammoniagenes, Ppt1p. These results conform with the inability of Ppt2p to activate the cytoplasmic type I FAS complex of yeast.

These results conform with the inability of Ppt2p to activate the cytoplasmic type I FAS complex of yeast. 4′-Phosphopantetheine serves as a prosthetic group in a variety of enzyme systems such as fatty acid synthases (1Lynen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Schweizer E. Naturwissenschaften. 1996; 83: 347-358PubMed Google Scholar), most polyketide synthases (3Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 37-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and several non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetases (4Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Similar to the chemically related soluble cofactor, coenzyme A, protein-bound phosphopantetheine fulfills in these enzymes a dual function, i.e. activation of acyl groups by thioester linkage to the terminal sulfhydryl, and acting as a flexible arm allowing translocation of intermediates between different catalytic sites. Apart from complex polycondensation systems, it is suggested that, in yeast, enzyme-bound phosphopantetheine is also involved in a single metabolic reaction, the reduction of α-amino-adipate to the respective semialdehyde (5Lambalot R.H.

According to their molecular structures, two classes of phosphopantetheine-containing proteins may be discriminated. One class is represented by a family of low molecular weight acyl carrier proteins (ACP) 1The abbreviations used are: ACPacyl carrier proteinFASfatty acid synthasePPTasephosphopantetheine:protein transferaseACPSACP synthaseBLASTbasic local alignment search toolbpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. functioning as structurally independent components of non-aggregated multienzyme systems and exhibiting no catalytic activity, by themselves (type II system).

Using the type II ACP of Escherichia coli, it had first been demonstrated by Vagelos and co-workers (6Prescott D.J. Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 25: 95-101Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that 4′-phosphopantetheine is transferred from coenzyme A to the hydroxyl group of a specific serine on apo-ACP. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme, phosphopantetheine:protein transferase (PPTase). To date, five different bacterial PPTases have been purified and characterized in some detail, i.e. EntD (5Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The substrates of EntD and Sfp are, respectively, the enterobactin synthetase of E. coli and the surfactin synthetase of Bacillus subtilis, while Ppt1p activates the two type I FAS enzymes of Brevibacterium ammoniagenes and ACPS the corresponding type II FAS of E. coli. No eucaryotic PPTase has been biochemically characterized, to date. Nevertheless, multiple PPTases are likely to occur in most eucaryotes, as is suggested by the occasional existence of several different phosphopantetheinylated proteins within the same cell. For instance, apart from the type I fatty acid synthase present in the cytoplasm of all non-plant eucaryotes, a FAS-like enzyme system of mitochondrial origin has been suggested to exist in fungi (10Chuman L. Brody S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), plants (10Chuman L. Brody S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and mammals (11Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This system exhibits a type II molecular structure and contains a low molecular weight ACP being comparable, in its size and sequence, to the respective E. coli protein. In the fungiSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa, mutational loss of mitochondrial ACP had no effect on bulk cellular fatty acid synthesis (12Schneider R. Massow M. Lisowsky T. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1995; 29: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Schneider R. Brors B. Massow M. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Instead, yeast ACP null mutants exhibit a respiratory-defective phenotype when grown on glycerol as a carbon source (12Schneider R. Massow M. Lisowsky T. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1995; 29: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This phenotype is strictly connected to the loss of endogenous lipoic acid synthesis and cannot be compensated by exogenous supply of this cofactor (14Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, mitochondrial FAS appears to be involved in the biosynthesis of the lipoic acid precursor, octanoic acid (14Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15Wada H. Shintani D. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As both the mitochondrial and the cytoplasmic FAS system require protein-bound 4′-phosphopantetheine as a prosthetic group, it remained to be shown whether the respective apo-proteins were activated by the same enzyme or, independently of each other, by two different PPTases. As will be reported in this study, inspection of the yeast genomic DNA sequence disclosed the open reading frame, YPL148C, as a potential PPTase coding sequence. It was demonstrated by both mutant analysis andin vitro activation of purified mitochondrial apo-ACP that the respective gene product represents in fact a novel phosphopantetheine:protein transferase, which specifically activates the low molecular weight mitochondrial ACP but not the type I FAS complex present in the yeast cytoplasm. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Genomic DNA fromS. cerevisiae and E. coli was isolated as described by Hoffman et al. (20Hoffman C.S. Winston F.

The cell pellet was suspended in 40 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, and 1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). Cell lysis was performed by sonication with a Branson B-12 sonifier, and insoluble components were removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Subsequently, 2 ml of Ni2+-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm NaCl was added. For adsorption of the hexahistidine-tagged protein, the suspension was stirred on ice for 1 h. The Ni2+-agarose was then washed twice with 40 ml of buffer A (without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and twice with 40 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, and 15% glycerol (buffer B). Subsequently the agarose was loaded onto a 5-ml column. The protein was eluted by a stepwise gradient from 0.1 to 0.5m imidazole dissolved in buffer B. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and aliquots were analyzed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The Ppt2p-containing fractions were stored in buffer B at −70 °C. The ACP synthase (ACPS) gene was PCR-amplified from E. coliM15 DNA using the forward primer ATCAGTTAGGCATGCCAATATTAGGTTTAGGCACG and the reverse primer TGCGTGAACAGATCTACTTTCAATAATTACCGTGGC. The PCR primers created novel SphI and BglII restriction sites (underlined). The ACPS reading frame was cloned into the expression vector pQE70 (Qiagen), and the resulting plasmid was transformed intoE. coli M15 (pRP4) (Qiagen). For ACPS purification, a 50-ml overnight culture of E. coli M15 transformants grown in Luria Broth with 50 mg/liter kanamycin and 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 30 °C was harvested, suspended in 200 ml of fresh medium without kanamycin, and induced with 4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The induced cells were grown for 6 h at 30 °C. Purification of ACP synthase was performed as described for Ppt2p. The construct used for Ppt1p expression has recently been described (9Stuible H.-P. Meier S. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Growth and purification conditions were as described above for theE. coli ACP synthase. For overexpression of mitochondrial ACP inS. cerevisiae the complete ACP1 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from yeast DNA of the strain JS91.15–23. The forward primer ATCGGGATCCATGTTTAGATCCGTTTGCCG created aBamHI restriction site (underlined) in front of the ATG-start codon. The reverse primer ATCGCTCGAGTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTTTGCGTCGGGATTGGAAGCGATATAATCGACCG introduced six histidine codons as well as a XhoI restriction site (underlined) downstream of the translational stop codon. The resulting PCR product was inserted into the E. coli/S. cerevisiae shuttle vector p425Met25 (23Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and transformed into theS. cerevisiae strain C13-ABY.S86. Transformants were selected according to their leucine prototrophy on leucine-free SCD medium containing 1 g/liter methionine. For ACP purification cells were grown at 30 °C in 1 liter of SCD medium containing, per liter, 40 g of glucose, 2 g of yeast nitrogen base (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 g of ammonium sulfate, and 1 g of methionine. The cells were harvested at late log-phase, inoculated into 1 liter of fresh medium without methionine, and grown for additional 16 h. The cell pellet obtained after centrifugation was frozen at −70 °C and subsequently suspended in buffer A. Cells were disrupted with glass beads at 4 °C, and any mitochondria still present in the resulting homogenate were lysed by sonication. The extract was fractionated by addition of ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation. After centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 × g, the ACP-containing supernatant was titrated with 11 m HCl to pH 1.0. The precipitate thereby obtained was collected by centrifugation and subsequently re-dissolved in 150 ml of buffer A by stirring the suspension for 16 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), the clear protein solution was combined with 2 ml of Ni2+-agarose. Subsequent purification steps were performed as described above for Ppt2p isolation. For expression in E. coli, the yeast mitochondrial ACP gene was PCR-amplified without its 36-amino acid N-terminal leader sequence. The forward primer GCACTGAACGCATGCCTGCAAACTTGAGCAAAGAT introduced an ATG start codon together with a SphI restriction site (underlined) at codon 37 of the ACP1 coding sequence, while the reverse primer GCACTGAACGGATCCGTTTGCGTCGGGATTGGA created a BamHI site (underlined) substituting the TAA stop codon. The SphI/BamHI-digested PCR product was cloned into the expression vector pQE70 (Qiagen) and transformed intoE. coli M15 (pRP4) (Qiagen). Expression and purification of the recombinant ACP were as described above for the E. coliACP synthase. The transfer of [3H]phosphopantetheine from [3H]coenzyme A to mitochondrial apo-ACP was monitored by liquid scintillation counting. Apo-ACP preparations were obtained by expressing the yeastACP1 gene either in the heterologous host, E. coli, or in S. cerevisiae Δppt2 disruptants. Purified apo-ACP preparations were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and subsequently used for in vitroactivation. In vitro phosphopantetheine transfer was carried out at 30 °C in a total volume of 1 ml containing 200 μg of apo-ACP, 10 μg of PPTase dissolved in buffer B, 50 μmcoenzyme A, 0.5 × 106 cpm [3H]coenzyme A (3.5 Ci/mmol) and 750 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 25 mm MgCl2 and 3 mmdithiothreitol. After 1 h of incubation, a small amount of Ni2+-agarose was added to the reaction mixture. This suspension was incubated for 10 min under gentle shaking to allow ACP adsorption. Ni2+-agarose together with the ACP bound to it was collected by centrifugation and washed five times with buffer A and, subsequently, five times with buffer B. Finally, the radioactivity adsorbed to the Ni2+-agarose matrix was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Lipoic acid analysis was performed as described recently (14Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ACP was analyzed, after reduction with 10 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.2, by native PAGE as described by Bollag et al. (25Bollag D.M. Rozycki M.D. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). N-terminal protein sequence determinations were performed by Toplab (München, Germany). Amino acid composition of ACP was determined according to Hannappel et al. (26Hannappel E. Kalbacher H. Voelter W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cysteamine was determined as taurine after performic acid oxidation of ACP (27Henschen A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Salnikow J. Erdmann V.A. Advanced Methods in Protein Microsequence Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 244-255Crossref Google Scholar). BLAST P searches with the yeast genome data base and the B. ammoniagenes PPTase, Ppt1p (accession number Y15081), as a reference revealed similarities to the C-terminal region of FAS subunit α (28% identical and 42% conserved positions) and to the hypothetical product of the reading frame, YPL148C (25% identical and 42% conserved position). The PPTase-like domain at the C terminus of one of the two fungal FAS subunits had already been noticed by Lambalotet al. (5Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) and by Stuible et al. (9Stuible H.-P. Meier S. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) when probing with the bacterial PPTase sequences, ACPS and Ppt1p, respectively. As was suggested by these authors, activation of fungal type I fatty acid synthases is possibly catalyzed by this PPTase domain and, thus, represents a capacity of the FAS enzyme itself. On the other hand, activation of mitochondrial ACP is unlikely to depend on thisFAS2-encoded PPTase-like domain, as no ACP-defective phenotype is observed with FAS2 deletants (data not shown). Thus, YPL148C was considered as a potential candidate for the gene controlling phosphopantetheinylation of yeast mitochondrial ACP. The YPL148 reading frame encodes a hypothetical protein of 177 amino acids in length and a calculated molecular mass of 20.319 kDa. Its overall sequence similarity to Ppt1p from B. ammoniagenes and to ACPS from E. coli is demonstrated in Fig.2. In order to characterize the biochemical function of YPL148C, part of its sequence was replaced by the kanMX4 gene, providing resistance against the antibiotic, G418 (cf. Fig. 1). Correct chromosomal integration of the kanMX4 marker was verified by Southern blotting and by PCR analysis (data not shown). YPL148C null mutants were viable on glucose as a carbon sources, but failed to grow on non-fermentable substrates such as glycerol. As these mutants grew on glucose-containing medium without fatty acid supplementation, activation of the cytoplasmic FAS-complex is clearly not affected by YPL148C inactivation. Furthermore, glycerol utilization of YPL148C mutants was not supported by supplementation with the complex mixture of fatty acids present in an alkaline butter hydrolysate nor by any of the nutrients contained in commercial batches of yeast extract and peptone. The growth characteristics of YPL148C disruptants were therefore identical to those of yeast ACP1 deletion mutants lacking mitochondrial ACP (12Schneider R. Massow M. Lisowsky T. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1995; 29: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similar to ACP1 null mutants, YPL148C disruptants exhibit the typical characteristics of Rho-negative yeast mutants, i.e. their respiratory defect is not complemented by a Rho-negative reference strain such as MYY110. All of these findings support the idea that YPL148C encodes the phosphopantetheine transferase activating the type II ACP of yeast mitochondria. Therefore, the so far unassigned reading frame, YPL148C, was designated as PPT2. The involvement of Ppt2p in phosphopantetheinylation of mitochondrial ACP was studied upon overexpression of recombinant mitochondrial ACP in appropriate yeast strains. Among several strains tested, only the protease-negative mutant C13-ABY.S86 as well as the Δppt2 disruptant SC 1383 and the Rho-negative mutant SC 1382, which both are derived from C13-ABY.S86, allowed overproduction of ACP from pSM80 under the control of the inducible MET25 promoter (23Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The recombinant ACP was isolated, as C-terminal hexahistidine fusion, by nickel chelate chromatography. The ACP preparations thus obtained from the three yeast strains, C13-ABY.S86, SC 1383, and the PPT2-positive, Rho-negative mutant SC 1382, were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was found that independent on whether the ACP was isolated from respiratory competent or respiratory-defective cells, always the leader-free protein was obtained starting with Ser-37 as the N-terminal amino acid (data not shown). Thus, neither ACP overproduction nor mitochondrial inactivation precluded efficient processing and, hence, organellar import of ACP. Native gel electrophoresis of ACP derived from C13-ABY.S86 and SC 1382 transformants revealed the presence of two ACP variants of different electrophoretic mobilities (Fig. 3). The presence of pre-ACP or of ACP dimers in these preparations is excluded according to the N-terminal sequencing data and as a result of the reduction of ACP with dithiothreitol, respectively. It is known that the electrophoretic mobility of E. coli holo-ACP is higher than that of the respective apo-form (28Keating D.H. Carey M. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22229-22235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, only the retarded ACP isoform was isolated from Δppt2 disruptant cells (Fig.3). This finding strongly supported the idea that both apo- and holo-ACP are included in the preparations derived fromPPT2-positive cells no matter whether these cells were respiratory-competent or respiratory-defective while exclusively apo-ACP but no holo-ACP is present in the PPT2 mutant. To verify this interpretation, ACP preparations isolated from C13-ABY.S86 and from the PPT2 null mutant, SC 1383, were tested for the presence of cysteamine. After performic acid oxidation, essentially no taurine was found in the hydrolysate of the SC 1383-derived ACP preparation. On the other hand, this cysteamine-derivative was clearly detectable in the preparation isolated from C13-ABY.S86 cells (data not shown).Together with the electrophoretic data shown in Fig. 3, these results suggest that about 50% of the ACP overproduced in wild type cells, and about 30% of that isolated from the Rho-negative mutant, SC 1382, were represented by holo-ACP while there was no ACP pantetheinylation to be detected in the PPT2-defective mutant, SC 1383. As is also evident from Fig. 3, holo-ACP synthesis is restituted to wild type level upon transformation of thePPT2 null mutant with the wild type PPT2 gene on a single-copy plasmid. Conclusive proof for Ppt2p acting as phospopantetheine:proteine transferase was derived from in vitro activation studies. For these studies, mitochondrial apo-ACP, the putative transferase, Ppt2p, and the bacterial PPTases, ACPS and Ppt1p, were purified by Ni2+-agarose chromatography upon overproduction of their hexahistidine-tagged derivatives by an inducible E. coli expression system. For efficient production in this host, the 36-amino acid pre-sequence of mitochondrial ACP had to be absent probably because of its negative effect on native protein conformation. Although endogenous ACP is known to strongly inhibit bacterial growth when overexpressed in E. coli (28Keating D.H. Carey M. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22229-22235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), no such effect was observed upon heterologous expression of yeast mitochondrial ACP. This finding conforms with the observation of Guerra et al. (29Guerra D.J. Dziewanowska K. Ohlrogge J.B. Beremand P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4386-4391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that overproduction of heterologous bacterial ACPs in E. coli is not toxic, either. To obtain sufficient amounts of recombinant Ppt2p protein, the slow growing E. coli strain, DH5α, had to be used together with reduced cultivation temperature. In contrast to the putative yeast transferase, the bacterial PPTases, ACPS and Ppt1p, were produced at high rates although induction of ACPS expression clearly inhibited growth of the E. coli transformants. The homogeneity of yeast mitochondrial ACP and of the enzyme preparations finally obtained was verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). The unusual electrophoretic migration characteristics of mitochondrial ACP indicating an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa rather than the calculated value of 9 kDa compare to that of endogenous E. coli ACP (28Keating D.H. Carey M. Cronan J.E. J. Biol."

These results provide the first indication of a conformational change that may occur upon binding of the holo-repressor to DNA. Iron is an essential nutrient for almost all living organisms including pathogenic bacteria. The availability of free iron in the mammalian host is extremely limited, since most of the extracellular iron is associated with transferrin and lactoferrin, and most of the intracellular iron is bound to heme-containing proteins (1Weinberg E.D. Perspect. Biol. Med. 1993; 36: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The extracellular Fe3+ concentration is usually restricted to concentrations below 10−18m, which is far too low to satisfy normal bacterial growth requirements. In addition, one important mammalian host response to infection is the release of additional transferrin and ferritin, thereby further reducing the amount of available iron (1Weinberg E.D. Perspect. Biol. Med. 1993; 36: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ability to acquire ferric iron from the mammalian host is therefore an important key element of infection. In order to solve this problem, many bacteria have developed elaborate mechanisms to capture ferric iron, including siderophore synthesis and specific membrane proteins (1Weinberg E.D. Perspect. Biol. Med. 1993; 36: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 14: 471-493Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, numerous virulence determinants produced by bacterial pathogens, including a variety of toxins, hemolysin, and proteins involved in the iron uptake system, are regulated by iron (3Litwin C.M. Calderwood S.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR), 1The abbreviations used are: DtxRdiphtheria toxin repressorr.m.s.root mean square. is a global iron-dependent negative repressor that is activated by ferrous iron. In the presence of the co-repressor Fe2+, DtxR binds its target DNA sequences as a homodimer, thereby repressing the genes controlled by the DtxR-regulated promotor (4Boyd J. Oza M.N. Murphy J.R.

The most important gene regulated by DtxR is the bacteriophage toxgene that encodes diphtheria toxin (10Pappenheimer A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 69-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the expression of siderophores in C. diphtheriae is regulated by DtxR (11Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whereas in vivo only Fe2+ acts as co-repressor, in vitro several divalent transition metal ions including Fe2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Cd2+, as well as Zn2+, can also function as activators (8Schmitt M.P. Twiddy E.M. Holmes R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7576-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Tao X. Murphy J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DtxR also binds to the promotor regions of the iron-regulatedirp1, irp2, irp3, irp4, and irp5promotor/operators (12Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lee J.H. Wang T. Ault K. Liu J. Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very little is known about the proteins encoded by the genes downstream from DtxR binding regions. The gene product regulated by irp1 has recently been identified as a 38-kDa periplasmatic lipoprotein implicated in the iron uptake system (14Schmitt M.P. Talley B.G. Holmes R.K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5364-5367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of a heme oxygenase is regulated by iron and DtxR (15Schmitt M.P. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several DtxR homologs have been discovered in Gram-positive bacteria, including the major human pathogensMycobacterium tuberculosis (16Schmitt M.P. Predich M. Doukhan L. Smith I. Holmes R.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4284-4289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Mycobacterium leprae (17Doukhan L. Predich M. Nair G. Dussurget O. Mandic-Mulec I. Cole S.T. Smith D.R. Smith I. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 165: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the soil bacteria Streptomyces pilosis andStreptomyces lividans (18Günther-Seeboth K. Schupp T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 166: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and Brevibacterium lactofermentum (19Oguiza J.A. Marcos A.T. Malumbres M. Martin J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 465-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These homologs share an overall amino acid sequence identity of about 60%. DtxR can therefore serve as a model for a family of related iron-dependent repressors in Gram-positive bacteria in a similar manner as the ferric iron uptake repressor (Fur), which controls more than 30 genes in Escherichia coli and related bacteria, is a model for a different family of iron-dependent repressors in Gram-negative bacteria (20Stojilikovic I. Baumler A.J. Hantke K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In order to understand the activation of DtxR by metals, it is essential to accurately determine the three-dimensional structures of the repressor with and without metal. Crystal structures of wild-type DtxR in complex with different divalent transition metals have been determined at 2.8-Å resolution (21Qiu X. Verlinde C.J.L.M. Zhang Z. Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 87-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and of apo-DtxR at 3.0-Å resolution in a different space group (22Schiering N. Tao X. Zeng H. Murphy J.R. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9843-9850Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, the resolution for Co-DtxR, Mn-DtxR, and Zn-DtxR has been extended to 1.85, 2.2, and 2.4 Å, respectively (23Qiu X. Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12292-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Pohl E. Qiu X. Must L. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These structures reveal an N-terminal domain of residues 1–73 that includes the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif and a dimerization domain (residues 74–140) that contains two metal binding sites. Binding site 1 in all structures elucidated so far contains a metal ion with high occupancy. The metal at this site is tetrahedrally coordinated by the side chains of His79, Glu83, His98 and by an oxygen of a sulfate anion. This site has also been designated the “cation-anion binding site” (23Qiu X. Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12292-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The metal at site 2 is coordinated by the side chains of Glu105, His106, the carbonyl oxygen of Cys102, and a water molecule. This site had only partial occupancy in the Cd-DtxR and Mn-DtxR crystal structures (23Qiu X. Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12292-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A similar site was also found to be occupied by Ni2+ in the crystal structure of the Cys102 → Asp DtxR variant determined by Ding et al. (25Ding X. Zeng H. Schiering N. Ringe D. Murphy J.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The third domain, comprising residues 148–226, was found to adopt an Src homology 3-like conformation (23Qiu X. Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12292-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, this domain is highly flexible in all crystal structures determined so far, and its function remains unclear. In this study, we report the first high resolution crystal structures of apo-DtxR at a resolution of 2.2 Å. Crystal structures were determined in two space groups. In crystal form I the molecule lies on a crystallographic two-fold axis with one monomer in the asymmetric unit, whereas in the related crystal form II the two-fold axis is noncrystallographic, and there is one protein dimer in the asymmetric unit. We also determined the crystal structures of DtxR in complex with zinc in the same two crystal forms to a resolution of 2.3 Å. The comparison of these four crystal structures provides the first evidence of the conformational changes that might be essential for the regulation of the repressor by its co-repressor. It turns out that the mechanism presumably involves the motion of the DNA-binding domain with respect to the metal binding domain rather than a rigid body motion of the monomers with respect to each other as suggested by Schieringet al. (22Schiering N. Tao X. Zeng H. Murphy J.R. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9843-9850Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) on the basis of their 3.0- and 3.8-Å structures of apo- and Ni-DtxR, respectively. DtxR was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli as described previously (5Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column followed by anion exchange chromatography (11Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DtxR in complex with zinc and sulfate was crystallized by vapor diffusion from 1.8–2.0 m ammonium sulfate and 10 mm Zn2+ using the hanging drop method as described by Qiu et al. (21Qiu X. Verlinde C.J.L.M. Zhang Z. Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 87-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Crystal dimensions were typically 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm. The metal-free form was crystallized in the presence of 1 mm EDTA in all buffers. Prior to crystallization, the protein was dialyzed twice against a buffer of 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA to ensure the removal of all residual metal ions. The two crystal modifications were obtained under the same conditions, sometimes with both crystal forms in the same drop. The data set of form II apo-DtxR was collected from two different crystals at room temperature mounted in capillaries. All other data sets were collected at cryogenic temperatures using crystals frozen in rayon loops (26Teng T.Y. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 387-391Crossref Google Scholar). Before cryo-cooling, the crystals were transferred into a drop containing 1.2–1.5 m ammonium sulfate and 15–20% glycerol (24Pohl E. Qiu X. Must L. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The data sets for apo-DtxR and for crystal form I of Zn-DtxR were collected on an RAXIS-II imaging plate detector using monochromatic CuKα radiation and focusing mirrors. The data set of Zn-DtxR in form II was collected at beam line 14B at NSLS (Brookhaven, NY) at a wavelength of 1.28 Å. In all cases, data were processed using DENZO and Scalepack (27Otwinowski Z.

Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). The structure of form II was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (29Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) with a dimer comprising residues 4–140 of the Co-DtxR structure (24Pohl E. Qiu X. Must L. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as a search model. Using data in the resolution range between 8 and 3.5 Å, the rotation function gave a 5.7 ς peak for the correct solution (second best 3.4 ς). The translation function resulted in a 17.8 ς peak with a correlation coefficient of 0.598 and R-factor of 49.3%. Rigid body refinement reduced the R-factor to 42.5% with a correlation coefficient of 0.626. At this point, the resulting electron density for the third domain was rather weak. In order to improve the density for the third domain, noncrystallographic averaging combined with histogram matching and solvent flattening was attempted using DM (30Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect . D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar, 31Cowtan K. Joint CCP.4 and ESF-EACBMNewsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). However, this did not improve the resulting electron density, and the map correlation coefficient for the region of domain 3 was only 0.35. Fitting an incomplete model of domain 3 into the ςA-weighted electron density in monomer A resulted in a drop of both R and Rfree by more than 2%. In contrast, including the third domain to monomer B did not result in any significant improvement in R orRfree. These results indicated that in monomer B domain 3 is disordered to a much larger degree than in monomer A, and this domain was subsequently left out from the model. Inclusion of low angle diffraction data with a bulk solvent correction did not improve the resulting density. In all four refinements, water molecules were added using the maxima in the Fo −Fc difference electron density that were at least 3.0 ς above the mean and had reasonable hydrogen bond geometry. In all cases, 5% of the data were used to calculate the free Rvalues (32Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar, 33Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab Crystal form I of both apo- and Zn-DtxR contains one monomer per asymmetric unit. The functional dimer is generated by the crystallographic two-fold axis in space group P3121. The final models of apo-DtxR and Zn-DtxR consist of the DNA-binding domain 1 (residues 1–73), the dimerization and metal-binding domain 2 (residues 74–140), and residues 148–197 and 201–226 of domain 3. The N-terminal residues 1–3 and two linker regions (residues 141–147 and 198–200) are invisible in the electron density map and were therefore not included in the structure. The model of Zn-DtxR includes one Zn2+ ion and a sulfate at the anion cation site and, in addition, a total of 159 well defined solvent molecules. The apo-DtxR structure contains 177 solvent positions. The third domain is partially disordered, while a number of polar surface residues had no electron density for the side chains and were thus refined as alanines. The final models yielded R-factors of 20.9% for apo-DtxR and 19.2% for Zn-DtxR with good geometry (TableII). All residues fall within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram (data not shown). In crystal form II, the asymmetric unit contains a dimer for both apo- and Zn-DtxR. The dimer is the result of a noncrystallographic two-fold axis in space group P3221. The first two domains are well defined in both monomers. Domain 3, however, appears to be severely disordered in one of the monomers where virtually no electron density was visible. The model therefore includes residues 4–140, 148–197, and 201–225 in subunit A of the dimer and only residues 4–140 in subunit B. The Zn-DtxR model includes a Zn2+ and a sulfate ion at the cation-anion binding site of both monomers A and B, and 169 well defined waters. The apo-DtxR model contains 163 solvent molecules. The missing third domain in monomer B is presumably responsible for the relatively high crystallographic R-factors of 25.7 (apo-DtxR) and 25.3% (Zn-DtxR) in the P3221 lattice. The final models possess good geometry for bond lengths and angles with all residues in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Further information on the crystallographic refinements is given in Table II. Since the apo- and Zn-DtxR form I crystals diffract to higher resolution and the model is also more complete in these structures, they will mainly be used for the detailed comparison of the metal binding sites of the apo- and holo-repressor described below. The overall structures of apo-DtxR and of DtxR bound to its divalent metal ion co-repressor are very similar; the r.m.s. deviations of Cα-atoms range from 0.3 to 0.5 Å (see TableIII). However, a careful analysis of the structures reveals significant domain motion of the DtxR subunits, as will be described below after comparing the metal binding sites in apo- and holo-DtxR.Table IIIr.m.s. deviations of the 2.2-Å apo-DtxR form I (this study) and several holo-DtxR structures in crystal form I (Å)Holo-repressor structureResolutionr.m.s. deviation with apo-DtxR form IReferenceAll Cαatoms4–7374–140140–225ÅZn-DtxR (form I)2.30.370.340.210.49This paperZn-DtxR (form II, subunit A)2.40.430.510.250.47This paperCo-DtxR1.850.350.280.250.4724Pohl E.

As mentioned before, metal binding site 1 has been observed to be occupied in all high resolution crystal structures of DtxR determined in the presence of divalent metal ions so far (21Qiu X.

The metal was found to be tetrahedrally coordinated by Nε2 of His79, Oε1 of Glu83, Nδ1 of His98, and a sulfate (or phosphate) ion. In apo-DtxR the metal binding site 1 is clearly not occupied (Fig.1 A). Yet no significant conformational changes appear to occur near site 1 upon metal removal. The r.m.s deviations of all 29 atoms of the metal-coordinating residues His79, Glu83, and His98 range between 0.1 and 0.2 Å when comparing the apo- and holo-DtxR subunits in all four structures with only minor changes in side chain conformations (Fig. 2). The averageB-factors for residues His79, Glu83, and His98 are 22 Å2 for apo-DtxR and 11 Å2 for Zn-DtxR (see Table II). The side chains of the coordinating residues have apparently more degrees of freedom in the apo-structure than in the metal-containing repressor.Figure 2Stereo view of a superposition of apo-DtxR at 2.2 Å and Zn-DtxR at 2.3 Å at metal binding site 1 after superposition of the Cα atoms in crystal form I.

These peaks have a relative height of 9.9 and 9.1 ς, respectively, in the two subunits of Zn-DtxR form II (data not shown), a clear indication that the anion binding site is occupied in all three independent Zn-DtxR subunits in crystal forms I and II. On the other hand, the anion binding site is empty in all three apo-DtxR subunits determined, and water peaks (of 5.9 ς in apo-DtxR form I and 3.9 and 4.5 ς in the two subunits of form II) appear about 2.6 Å from the center of the sulfate anion observed in the metal-containing structures (Fig. 1, C andD). The absence of the anion in all three apo-DtxR subunits in the two crystal forms suggests that the metal cofactor is necessary for anion binding. In wild type DtxR, metal binding site 2 has so far only been observed to be partially occupied in the 2.8-Å Cd-DtxR (21Qiu X. Verlinde C.J.L.M. Zhang Z. Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 87-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and the 2.2-Å Mn-DtxR structures (23Qiu X. Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12292-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In both of those cases, the metal appears to be coordinated by Oε1 of Glu105, Nε2 of His106, the carbonyl oxygen of Cys102, and a well ordered water molecule. A comparison of the apo-DtxR and Mn-DtxR structures shows no significant conformational changes of this binding site (Fig.3) with a r.m.s. deviation for all non-hydrogen atoms of the coordinating residues of 0.2 Å. The averageB-factors of these residues are also very similar in the apo- and the manganese-containing structures: 21 Å2 for apo-DtxR and 22 Å2 for Mn-DtxR. In both Zn-DtxR structures described in this paper, site 2 does not appear to be occupied by a metal ion. There is no density present except for a water molecule (data not shown). It has been suggested that the lack of metal binding at site 2 is due to the formation of a persulfide or a mixed disulfide at cysteine 102 (23Qiu X. Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J.

In all metal-bound DtxR crystal structures investigated so far, including the two Zn-DtxR structures described in this paper, theFo − Fc difference electron density had its strongest peak at approximately 2 Å from the Sγ of Cys102, which, based on geometric criteria, can be interpreted as a sulfur atom bound to the Sγ (23Qiu X.

The late stages of the terminal differentiation program in epidermis correspond to cornification, a particular cell death process transforming keratinocytes into anucleated, flattened corneocytes. Stacking of the corneocytes forms the most superficial epidermal layers, designated as the cornified layers or stratum corneum, and is responsible for the mechanical protection of the body. Corneocytes are continually shed from the epidermis surface in the tightly regulated process of desquamation (1Holbrook K.A. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. Watt F.M. The Keratinocyte Handbook. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1994: 3-39Google Scholar, 2Roop D. Science. 1995; 267: 474-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Corneocyte function is achieved by peculiar structures formed during cornification. The cornified cell envelope, a rigid pericellular shell, consists of covalently linked proteins. Its external side is covered by a monomolecular lipid layer, whereas its internal surface is linked to a cytokeratin-rich fibrous matrix that occupies the entire intracellular volume (3Simon M. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. Watt F.M. The Keratinocyte Handbook. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1994: 275-292Google Scholar, 4Reichert U. Michel S. Schmidt R. Darmon M. Blumenberg M.

Indeed, considerable morphological modifications of the desmosomes occur when keratinocytes reach the cornified layers. The desmosomal plaque, thought to be incorporated in the cornified cell envelope, is no longer observed, and the characteristic symmetrical trilamellar structure of the extracellular core becomes transformed into a homogeneous electron dense plug (5Menton D.N.

In the upper spinous and granular layers (the last nucleated suprabasal keratinocytes), corneodesmosin is located in specialized secretory vesicles, called keratinosomes or lamellar bodies, that serve as delivery vehicles for intercellular lipids and enzymes. Then, in the upper granular layers, it is also associated to the desmosomal core soon before the transformation of desmosomes into corneodesmosomes. In the cornified layers, corneodesmosome plugs were also shown to contain the protein (9Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J.

Corneodesmosin is covalently linked to the cornified cell envelopes in discrete regions corresponding to corneodesmosomes (9Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A. Ouhayoun J.-P.

When extracted from the nucleated keratinocyte layers, corneodesmosin is detected as a glycosylated and phosphorylated basic protein with an apparent molecular mass of 52–56 kDa. During stratum corneum maturation, corneodesmosin is progressively proteolysed until desquamation occurs. In superficial corneocytes, the 52–56 kDa form is no longer detected and immunoreactive fragments of 45 to 30 kDa are predominant (9Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Réano A.

Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A close association exists also between corneodesmosin proteolysis and corneocyte shedding at the epidermal surface in an in vitro model of desquamation (22Lundström A. Serre G. Haftek M. Egelrud T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Since location, biochemical characteristics and processing of corneodesmosin are similar in several mammals (23Montézin M. Simon M. Guerrin M. Serre G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the protein is probably essential for the function of corneodesmosomes and thus for corneocyte cohesion. Amino acid sequencing of two peptides, 10 and 15 amino acids long, obtained after proteolysis of purified human corneodesmosin showed that corneodesmosin is related to the product of the S gene (21Simon M. Montézin M. Guerrin M. Durieux J.-J. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31770-31776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a gene previously identified by CpG island analysis in the class I region of the human major histocompatibility complex (24Zhou Y.

Here, we report the molecular cloning of human corneodesmosin cDNA and demonstrate that corneodesmosin is indeed encoded by theS gene. In addition, the predicted protein is shown to be longer than initially reported, and additional polymorphisms are described. In agreement with its location in keratinosomes, expression in COS-7 cells indicated that corneodesmosin is a secreted protein. Using in vitro synthesized truncated proteins, the epitopes of two anti-corneodesmosin antibodies were localized in the central domain of the protein. Fragments corresponding to this region were detected in extracts of the most superficial corneocytes. This shows that serine- and glycine-rich domains of corneodesmosin, probably folded as loops, are cleaved before desquamation and then could be responsible for putative adhesion properties of the protein. An mRNA purification kit was purchased from Dynal (Oslo, Sweden). cDNA synthesis kit, Zap Express DNA, and Gigapack II packaging extracts were from Stratagene. Modification and restriction enzymes, used in subcloning experiments, and oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). DNA sequencing was performed with the ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). The anti-corneodesmosin mAbs G36-19, F28-27, and B17-21 are part of a series of antibodies produced and previously characterized in our laboratory (9Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F.

Cell Res. 1997; 231: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The ascites fluid containing the mAb MOPC-21 (Sigma) was used as a negative control. In all experiments, G36-19 and F28-27 were used at 0.2 μg/ml; B17-21 and MOPC-21 were used at 2 μg/ml. The Western blotting method has been precisely described previously (23Montézin M. Simon M. Guerrin M. Serre G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated sheep immunoglobulins to mouse IgG (Biosys, Compiègne, France) were revealed with the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham, Aylesbury, UK). Normal skin (kindly provided by Prof. M. Costagliola, Rangueil University Hospital, Toulouse, France) was obtained from plastic surgery specimens and used immediately. Thin fragments obtained with a dermatome were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, in a 0.25% trypsin solution (solution A, Life Technologies, Inc. , Cergy Pontoise, France), dermal side down. The epidermis was then peeled off with forceps, rinsed gently in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and homogenized in the lysis/binding buffer from the mRNA purification kit. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted with oligo(dT)25-tagged magnetic microspheres, according to the supplier's instructions, and quantified with the DNA DipStick kit (Invitrogen). cDNAs were synthesized by oligo(dT) priming of 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA, size-fractionated (>500 bp) and unidirectionally cloned in lambda ZAP Express vector, following the instructions of Stratagene. The library, consisting of approximately 2 × 105 primary recombinants, was packaged with Gigapack II packaging extracts (Stratagene) and plated for immunoscreening without amplification. The library was screened with a pool of the three mAbs G36-19, F28-27, and B17-21 essentially as described in the instruction manual of the picoBlue immunoscreening kit (Stratagene). Positive clones were plaque-purified and tested with each of the mAbs. In vivoexcision of the pBK-CMV phagemid vectors from ZAP Express clones was performed as described by Stratagene. cDNA inserts were analyzed by restriction mapping and one-run sequencing, using T3 and M13 primers. Comparisons of the 3′ and 5′ sequences with the data bases were performed with BLAST software (25Altschul A. Stephen F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). To obtain the complete cDNA of corneodesmosin, poly(A)+RNA (∼ 80 ng) was primed with random hexamers and reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR amplification was performed on 1/20th of the cDNA reaction mixture. The upper primer corresponded to S cDNA sequence from nucleotide (nt) 2 to nt 21 (GenBank L20815), with a SpeI linker. The lower primer was complementary to nt 998–1017 of the same sequence. The PCR product was digested with SpeI and EcoNI restriction enzymes and cloned in the pBK-CMV phagemid isolated from clone 1.1, leading to pS11. To generate an expression vector, the 2106-bp Ecl136I/NotI fragment from plasmid pS11 was subcloned into pcDNA 1.1/amp (Invitrogen) digested withEcoRV and NotI, resulting in p14.9. p14.9 was sequenced using various primers that were located from the T7 promoter priming site up to nt 1767 of S cDNA sequence. The Oligo software was used for primer design optimization, and sequencing reactions were repeated three times. Genomic analyses were performed on human DNA (obtained from Prof. M. Abbal, Rangueil University Hospital) extracted from blood samples of 10 healthy donors. Approximately 400 ng of genomic DNA or 0.1 ng of p14.9 were used for PCR amplification. The nature of the nucleotides at positions 1118 and 1236 was assessed by restriction analyses after PCR amplification with primers 908–925 and 1573–1593 in standard conditions. Position 1514 was analyzed in the same way with primers 1446–1465 and 1767–1786. To determine the nucleotide at position 66, allele-specific amplification was performed in two separate PCR mixtures, with forward specific primers 52–65 bearing A or T at position 66 and reverse unspecific 572–591 primer after optimization according to Sommer et al. (26Sommer S.S. Groszbach A.R. Bottema C.D.K. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 82-87PubMed Google Scholar). After 2 min of initial denaturation at 94 °C, 30 cycles were performed with 50 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 56 °C, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min when p14.9 was used as template, or 2.5 min when genomic DNA was used. COS-7 cells (a kind gift from Dr. M. Corbani, CNRS, Toulouse) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and transfected by electroporation with a gene pulser (Bio-Rad), using 15 μg of plasmid per 2 × 106 cells (960 microfarads, 240 V in 400 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). After 24 h of culture, cells were rinsed three times with serum-free medium and grown in the absence of serum for an additional 30-hr period. To purify secreted corneodesmosin, conditioned medium was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm to eliminate cell debris. After addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (PharMingen), 15 ml of medium was purified by anion exchange and affinity chromatography, as described previously (21Simon M. Montézin M. Guerrin M. Durieux J.-J. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31770-31776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To analyze intracellular corneodesmosin, cell monolayers were solubilized in lysis buffer (Tris-HCl, 40 mm, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing the protease inhibitor mixture and cleared by 15 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Samples were probed by Western blotting. Proteins from human epidermis extracted and analyzed with the same procedures were used as positive control for corneodesmosin. To obtain serial C-terminal deletions of corneodesmosin, PCR was performed on p14.9 with an upper primer consisting of a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase linked to nt 15–34 (primer 14, Fig. 4) and a series of lower primers bearing an in-frame stop codon (primers 15–21, Fig. 4). PCR products were directly subjected to in vitro transcription/translation with the TNT-T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system, according to the recommendations of Promega (0.5 μg of p14.9 or 3 μl of PCR reactions and 20 μl of the Quick Master Mixt, 90 min at 30 °C), and analyzed by Western blotting. Superficial stratum corneum extracts were obtained from volunteers as follows. An area of calf skin was covered with a nylon mesh (40 μm; Spectrum Medical Industries, Houston, TX) and painted with acetone-soluble varnish. After drying for a few minutes, the painted area was stripped. After a brief incubation in acetone, the tissue was recovered by centrifugation (500 × g, 1 min), washed in acetone, and air dried. The resulting powdery material (a kind gift from D. Bernard, L'Oréal, Clichy, France) was boiled for 10 min in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS and 0.2 m DTT, and the suspension was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). Laemmli's sample buffer was added to the supernatants, and the extracts were analyzed by Western blotting. To clone corneodesmosin cDNA with specific mAbs, poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from breast epidermis, and an expression cDNA library was constructed in a lambda-derived vector. The library, containing 2 × 105 independent clones, was screened with a mixture of the three anti-corneodesmosin mAbs, G36-19, F28-27, and B17-21. Among 16 positive clones, five were plaque-purified and tested individually with each mAb (Fig. 1 a). Three clones (1.1, 4.4, and 5.1) reacted with the three mAbs, one clone (5.5) reacted with G36-19 and F28-27, and one clone (1.2) was only positive for F28-27 (Fig. 1 b). The inserts were sequenced from both extremities in one run. The sequences obtained were found to be 99% homologous to parts of the human keratinocyte S cDNA (GenBank fileL20815; Ref. 24Zhou Y. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1 b. The reactivity profile of each mAb toward the various clones, and the determination of the boundaries of the inserts, allowed us to delineate segments of the cDNA encoding each epitope. The epitopes recognized by B17-21 and G36-19 were encoded by the 594/762 and 762/1044 cDNA segments, respectively. The segment of the coding part of the cDNA downstream of nt 1044 encoded the epitope recognized by F28-27 (Fig.1 b). Two S mRNAs of 2.2 and 2.6 kb, resulting from alternative polyadenylation splicing have been described (24Zhou Y. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9470-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The 3′ end of clone 5.1 corresponded to the longer form, whereas the 3′ end of both clones 1.1 and 5.5 matched the shorter form, confirming the use of alternative polyadenylation signals in vivo. The 3′-untranslated region of both clones 4.4 and 1.2 was 9 nt longer than that of clones 1.1 and 5.5 (see Fig. 1 b). As none of the clones contained the ATG initiation codon of the S protein, the 5′ end of corneodesmosin cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using poly(A)+ RNA extracted from human epidermis and primers derived from the GenBank sequence. The amplified product was cloned in phagemid 1.1 to reconstitute the entire coding sequence. The resulting insert was subcloned in pcDNA 1.1/amp leading to p14.9 and was sequenced from nt 2–1700. Four punctual differences were found between the corneodesmosin and S protein cDNA sequences. The insertion of G at position 1515 in the corneodesmosin sequence induced a frame shift resulting in the extension of the reading frame. The TAA codon at position 530 (the first ATG codon being designated as codon 1) replaces the stop codon TAG predicted in the S protein cDNA sequence at position 503. The two C-terminal amino acids (IS) of the predicted sequence of the S protein (s) are therefore replaced in the corneodesmosin (c) sequence by the 29 following amino acids: DILAQVRPLGPQLADPEVFLPQGELLDPS. A silent mutation at codon 368 (GCAS→GCGCalanine) and two amino acid changes at codons 18 (TTGSleucine→ATGC methionine) and 408 (TCCS serine →GCCC alanine) were also identified. Ten human genomic DNA samples (individuals 1–10) were analyzed by PCR to determine whether or not these sequence discrepancies originated from genetic polymorphism. We first analyzed a potential polymorphism at nt 1515 (Fig. 2 a). The insertion of a G at this position in the corneodesmosin sequence created anNciI restriction site and suppressed a BsiMI site present in the S protein sequence. The genomic fragment encompassing nt 1446–1786 was amplified by PCR from the 10 genomic DNA samples as well as from p14.9. In all cases, a fragment of the expected size (341 bp) was amplified and digested by NciI into fragments of 276 and 65 bp (Fig. 2 a and data not shown). None of the amplified products were digested by BsiMI. Consequently, all 10 genomic DNA samples matched the corneodesmosin, rather than the S protein, sequence. As all of the 20 alleles analyzed conformed to the corneodesmosin sequence, we speculate that the absence of a G at this position in the published S protein sequence results from a sequencing error, although the existence of a rare allele cannot be excluded. The corneodesmosin sequence has therefore been submitted to the EMBL/GenBank data base. Sequence divergences at nt 1118 and 1236 were analyzed by a similar methodology (Fig. 2 b). Sequence analysis predicted aBsmI restriction site at nt 1115 in the S protein cDNA but not in that of the corneodesmosin. Conversely, a Hin6I restriction site at nt 1234 was only predicted by the corneodesmosin sequence. The 908–1593 segment was amplified by PCR with the 10 genomic DNA samples, with p14.9 as a control, and submitted to enzymatic digestion by either BsmI or Hin6I. As expected, the PCR product from p14.9 was totally digested byHin6I but was unaffected by BsmI digestion (Fig.2 b). Among the DNA genomic samples, six were partially digested by BsmI (see sample 1), one was totally digested with BsmI, whereas three were partially digested byHin6I (see sample 4). Consequently, among the 20 alleles analyzed, 8 matched the protein S sequence at nt 1118, whereas 3 matched the corneodesmosin sequence at nt 1236, establishing polymorphism at these two positions. At position 66, the sequences of the corneodesmosin and Sgenes contain A and T, respectively. To analyze a potential polymorphism at this position, the genomic DNA samples were amplified by PCR using allele-specific 5′ primers and a common 3′ primer. In a preliminary control experiment using p14.9 as a template, a band of the expected size (539 bp) was amplified with the 5′ primer corresponding to the corneodesmosin sequence, but not with that of the S protein (Fig. 2 c). With one genomic DNA sample (individual 1), a fragment of 3.4 kb was amplified with both allele-specific 5′ primers (Fig. 2 c). The size of this fragment was expected from the presence of a 2.9-kb intron between the primers. We therefore concluded that this genomic DNA was heterozygous at this position. Among the 10 DNA samples analyzed, 4 had the same profile. Six samples (including that from individual 2 shown in Fig. 2 c) were only amplified with the 5′ primer corresponding to the corneodesmosin sequence, suggesting homozygosity at this position. Among the 20 alleles analyzed, 16 were of the corneodesmosin type and 4 of the Sgene type. No sample homozygous for the S gene allele was found. The position of the intron was analyzed by sequencing an amplification product obtained from genomic DNA sample 2 with primers 2–20 and 275–294. The 5′ splice site was AG99/GTAGGA and the 3′ splice site was ACAG/G100GACCT. To characterize the recombinant protein, COS-7 cells were transfected with p14.9. After 2 days of expression, the cells were lysed in a hypotonic buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 to analyze cellular corneodesmosin. A Western blotting analysis with G36-19 revealed an immunoreactive protein with apparent Mr ∼62,000, which was not present in mock-transfected cells (Fig.3, lanes 1 and 2). No additional immunoreactive proteins were detected when the cells were directly solubilized in Laemmli's sample buffer (data not shown). Despite a transfection efficiency of approximately 30% (data not shown), corneodesmosin was only detected on overloaded gels after a 30-min exposure time, suggesting a low expression level. The presence of a consensus signal sequence at the 5′ end of the corneodesmosin cDNA prompted us to test for corneodesmosin secretion. Serum-free conditioned medium from transfected COS-7 cells was purified by anion exchange and affinity chromatography. Western blot analysis with G36-19 revealed the presence of corneodesmosin in the culture medium (Fig. 3,lane 4), showing that corneodesmosin is secreted by transfected COS-7 cells. Cellular recombinant corneodesmosin migrated with higherMr than the 52–56 kDa corneodesmosin extracted, in the same conditions, from human epidermis (Fig. 3, lane Ep), suggesting that the epidermal form does not comprise the entire amino acid sequence. On the other hand, the species released in culture medium migrated more closely to the epidermal form. This may indicate a cleavage of corneodesmosin that is not specific to the epidermis but rather is associated with its secretion. However, the apparent Mr of secreted recombinant corneodesmosin could not be precisely determined because of the high salt content of the samples after affinity chromatography. Attempts to reduce the salt concentration resulted in loss of immunoreactivity, probably the result of protein degradation. To further characterize the size of the protein encoded by the corneodesmosin cDNA, p14.9 was subjected to in vitrotranscription/translation. The protein product, revealed by Western blotting with both mAbs G36-19 and F28-27, migrated as a single species of an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa (Fig.4, lane p14.9). Comparison with the 51.5 kDa, predicted from the cDNA sequence, indicates an aberrant migration of the protein in SDS-gels, probably the result of its unusual amino acid sequence. The reactivity of the three anti-corneodesmosin mAbs toward the various phage clones allowed a preliminary localization of their epitopes (Fig. 1). To refine this localization, various C-terminal deleted forms of corneodesmosin were produced in vitro and analyzed by Western blotting. The results of representative analyses are shown in Fig. 4 a. After in vitro transcription/translation, the PCR product generated using 3′ primer 20 gave a positive signal with G36-19, whereas no signal was detected with 3′ primer 21. F28-27 gave a positive signal with 3′ primer 19, but not with primers 20 or 21. Therefore, the data showed that the F28-27 epitope is encoded by the cDNA sequence located between primers 19 and 20 and the G36-19 epitope by the sequence b"
https://openalex.org/W2092027227,"High affinity iron transport in yeast is mediated by two proteins, Fet3p and Ftr1p. The multicopper oxidase Fet3p is thought to convert extracellular ferrous iron to ferric iron, which then crosses the plasma membrane through the permease Ftr1p. Fet3p is capable of oxidizing other substrates, such asp-phenylenediamine, and there is still a question of whether it is the ferroxidase activity that is essential for iron transport. Fet3p is also required for Ftr1p localization to the cell surface, making it difficult to prove a direct role for Fet3p oxidase in high affinity iron transport. In an attempt to generate Fet3p specifically lacking ferroxidase activity, we used site-directed mutagenesis to alter residues within Fet3p that had been suggested to impart iron oxidase activity. These substitutions resulted in either a loss or retention of both p-phenylenediamine and ferroxidase activities, indicating that the ability of Fet3p to act as a ferroxidase involves other amino acids. Inactive Fet3p, however, did mediate Ftr1p localization to the cell surface but did not mediate high affinity iron transport. These observations indicate that the ferroxidase activity of Fet3p is intrinsically required for high affinity iron transport.

The high affinity iron transport system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is specific for iron and is transcriptionally regulated by iron need (1Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This transport system is composed of two proteins, Ftr1p and Fet3p (2Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L.

Ftr1p, the iron permease, has six transmembrane regions and a potential iron binding motif present within the third transmembrane domain (3Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Fet3p is a copper-requiring enzyme with a classical leader sequence and one transmembrane domain present near the carboxyl terminus (2Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Both Fet3p and Ftr1p are dependent upon one another for maturation through the secretory pathway. When Fet3p is absent, Ftr1p fails to localize to the plasma membrane. Without Ftr1p, Fet3p is not loaded with copper and does not become enzymatically active (3Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Fet3p is a member of the multicopper oxidase family of proteins. It has been proposed that high affinity iron transport occurs when Fet3p oxidizes extracellular ferrous iron, which is then transported into the cell through the permease. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that Fet3p is responsible for an iron-dependent oxygen consumption in intact cells, and iron is the best substrate yet tested for Fet3p in vitro (5de Silva D.M.

Because Fet3p is able to act on substrates other than iron, the specific role of the ferroxidase activity in iron transport has yet to be directly demonstrated. In this study, we set out to use site-directed mutagenesis to alter the substrate specificity of Fet3p in order to generate a Fet3p possessing p-phenylenediamine (pPD) 1The abbreviations used are: pPDp-phenylenediaminePCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. oxidase activity but lacking iron oxidase activity.

Of all the multicopper oxidases, only Fet3p and ceruloplasmin have been reported to oxidize iron (6de Silva D. Davis-Kaplan S. Fergestad J. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Specific regions and amino acids in these enzymes have been hypothesized to impart ferroxidase activity (9Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar,10Murphy M.E. Lindley P.F. Adman E.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Ligands involved in type I copper binding are thought to define the ability of a multicopper oxidase to oxidize iron (9Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). These ligands are a P1 histidine, P2 cysteine, P3 histidine, and a P4 ligand that varies between members of the multicopper oxidase family. Ceruloplasmin has two multicopper oxidase domains; one with a P4 leucine that may be critical for ferroxidase activity. Consistent with this theory, Fet3p, the only other multicopper oxidase reported to oxidize iron, possesses a leucine in the P4 position (2Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). To test this theory, we used site-specific mutagenesis to alter the P4 position in Fet3p. We also tested a second set of predictions that suggested that domains in Fet3p dissimilar to non-iron-oxidizing multicopper oxidases, such as ascorbate oxidase and laccase, might be involved in conferring ferroxidase activity (10Murphy M.E. Lindley P.F. Adman E.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our data suggests that neither of these predictions define amino acids, which determine iron oxidase activity. We did generate mutated Fet3p, however, devoid of catalytic activity that was used to further define the role of Fet3p activity in high affinity iron transport.

To generate the type I P4 mutant proteins, PCR primers were made that spanned the P4 codon and a unique BamHI site. Within these primers, the P4 codon was altered to produce the desired amino acid. A second PCR primer was generated that spanned a unique AvrII site located 220 base pairs upstream. PCR reactions were done using pSDAVRII and each mutagenic primer in an Idaho Technologies Thermocycler. Reaction conditions were as follows: SDMET, SDPHE, SDVAL, SDPHE489 (30 s 94 hot start/D 94 0 s/A 50 0 s/E 72 60 s) 40 cycles; SDLYS, SDALA, SDILE (30 s 94 hot start/D94 0 s/A 55 0 s/E 72 60 s) 40 cycles. These products were digested withBamHI and AvrII. A vector with FET3under the control of the GAL10 promoter (pYFET3) was digested withSacI and EcoRI, treated with Klenow, and religated to generate a vector with a unique BamHI site within FET3. The resulting plasmid, 831, was transformed into the Δfet3 strain DY1397–6A. This plasmid complemented the defects of the Δfet3 only when galactose was supplied as a carbon source. In addition, equivalent amounts of Fet3p were produced from this construct whether cells were grown in iron-replete or iron-depleted galactose conditions. To generate the mutant Fet3p constructs, 831 was digested with BamHI andAvrII, and ligations were done with each digested SD PCR product. The resulting plasmids that contained the 220-base pairAvrII-BamHI insert were sequenced using pCHECK1 and pCHECK2. To generate the second set of mutants, we took advantage of uniqueBstEII and PshAI sites within FET3. PCR products were made with pBSTEII and pSDE227A, pSDD228A (30 s 94 hot start/D 94 0 s/A 55 0 s/E 72 15 s) 35 cycles, or pSDE330A (30 s 94 hot start/D 94 0 s/A 45 0 s/E 72 15 s) 35 cycles. The products and p831 were digested with PshAI and BstEII and ligated together. The resulting clones were sequenced with pCHECK3 and pCHECK4. All the plasmids used in this study possessed no alterations of the restriction site junctions or the amplified 220-base pair insert except the directed mutations. The Δfet3 strain DY1397-6A was transformed using standard procedures with each of the vectors containing altered FET3, 831 (L494), and pYES2.0 alone (Invitrogen) (2Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The resulting strains were grown on CM-URA media (0.69% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.13% amino acid supplementation excluding uracil, 2.0% glucose). To induce the expression of FET3, cells were grown in CM-URA galactose (CM-URA with 2% galactose instead of glucose). To make the cells iron-limited, the iron chelator bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid (Sigma) was added to a concentration of 12.5 μm to the CM-URA galactose medium. Cells were grown overnight in CM-URA galactose media and then incubated in CM-URA galactose bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid for 8 h. The cells were harvested, and membrane preparations were made using previously established procedures (11Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thirty μg of total membrane protein was run on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Gelman Sciences). The blot was incubated with a 1:3,000 dilution of a rabbit antibody generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a region of Fet3p near the C terminus for 2 h at 37 degrees (5de Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The blot was washed, incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h at 37 degrees and developed with ECL chemiluminescent detection solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells harboring each of the SD constructs were transformed with a Ftr1p:Myc construct generously supplied by A. Dancis (3Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown overnight in CM-URA-LEU galactose media and then placed into CM-URA-LEU galactose bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid for 6 h to induce the expression of Ftr1p:Myc. Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (3Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Images were captured using a Nikon microscope with the Openlab software using a Macintosh work station. Thirty μg of total membrane protein in 1% SDS were run onto 4–10% SDS-PAGE gradient gels in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol and heat denaturation. The gels were incubated in 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100 solution for 1 h and then incubated in 3 mm pPD dihydrochloride in 100 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 5.7) for 1 h at room temperature as described previously (11Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The gels were then incubated under dark and humid conditions to allow pPD to oxidize. Ferroxidase assays were done by altering the pPD oxidase assay protocol. Six μg of membrane protein were prepared and run onto 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels as before. The gels were treated in 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100 solution for 1 h and then incubated in 200 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, added from a fresh 200 mm stock, in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 1 h at room temperature. The gels were then incubated as above and then overlaid with cellophane rehydrated in a 15 mm ferrozine stock solution made in water with the pH adjusted to 7.0 with sodium hydroxide. Cells were grown overnight in CM-URA galactose media and then incubated in CM-URA galactose bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid media for 8 h. Iron transport assays were done in the presence of ascorbate as described previously (4Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The multicopper oxidase type I copper P4 has been hypothesized to impact substrate specificity. The identity of the P4 amino acid has been suggested to alter the redox potential of the type I copper, affecting the ability of the protein to oxidize various substrates (9Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Specifically, a P4 amino acid that is able to act as a copper ligand, such as phenylalanine or methionine, has been predicted to oxidize pPD but not iron. A leucine at the P4 position was predicted to be unable to act as a copper ligand, resulting in a type I copper with a redox potential high enough to oxidize iron (9Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This theory is consistent with the observation that the two multicopper oxidases reported to oxidize iron, Fet3p and ceruloplasmin, have a P4 leucine. In addition, the P4 leucine is conserved between Fet3p and theSchizosaccharomyces pombe Fet3p homolog, Fio1p (Fig.1). To test this hypothesis, the P4 leucine of Fet3p (Leu-494) was altered using site-directed mutagenesis. Leucine 494 was changed to methionine (L494M), as found in ascorbate oxidase, or a phenylalanine (L494F), as found in many fungal laccases. It was predicted that these alterations would generate a Fet3p with pPD oxidase activity and no ferroxidase activity. Leucine 494 was also changed to either valine (L494V), alanine (L494A), or isoleucine (L494I). These conservative alterations were not expected to affect enzyme activity. Additionally, leucine 494 was changed to a lysine (L494K), and the invariant P3 histidine 489 was changed to a phenylalanine (H489F). These changes were expected to abolish Fet3p enzyme activity. Expression of the mutant genes was normalized by placing theFET3 gene under the control of an iron-independent promoter, GAL10. A Fet3 disruption strain was transformed with the plasmids, and Western analysis was used to visualize Fet3p. All the mutant proteins demonstrated the same mobility as wild type Fet3p (Fig.2 A). Most mutated proteins also were expressed equivalently except L494V, L494F, and L494A, which sometimes showed lower levels of protein on a Western. To determine whether our substitutions affected Fet3p multicopper oxidase function, pPD oxidase activity was measured. Membrane extracts from cells expressing mutated proteins were run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and pPD oxidase activity was visualized by the color change when pPD becomes oxidized (11Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This assay, although not quantitative, is highly specific for Fet3p activity. Wild type extracts (Leu-494) showed pPD oxidase activity, whereas extracts from vector alone (Vect) produced no pPD oxidase activity (Fig. 2 B). As expected, substitutions of the type I copper ligands that were predicted to disrupt enzyme activity (L494K and H489F) did not show any pPD oxidase activity. Of the P4 amino acid substitutions found in other multicopper enzymes, pPD oxidase activity was observed only in L494M. The predicted conservative substitutions such as L494A, L494I, and L494V also did not show any pPD oxidase activity. The lack of observable activity in the P4 mutants does not indicate that these enzymes are completely inactive. This assay requires approximately 3 μg of total membrane protein (10% of the amount used in these blots) from cells containing wild type Fet3p. Thus, any mutation that decreases Fet3p activity by 10-fold may not appear active in this assay. To determine whether the mutant Fet3p constructs had lost or retained iron oxidase activity, ferroxidase assays were performed using crude membrane preparations in a gel-based assay similar to pPD activity assays. Gels were incubated in the presence of ferrous iron and developed by the addition of ferrozine, which changes color when bound to ferrous iron. Areas that remained color-free corresponded to the location of Fet3p or the multicopper oxidase ceruloplasmin. This assay has the advantage of being highly specific for Fet3p activity, with no confounding effects from nonspecific ferroxidase activity. Heat-denatured Fet3p and ceruloplasmin did not show ferroxidase activity. Ferroxidase assays of the mutant constructs showed that only L494M possessed detectable ferroxidase activity (Fig. 2 C). This is consistent with the results obtained for pPD oxidase activity, indicating that the mutations made to the P4 copper ligand have not resulted in a detectable change of specificity but an overall affect on enzyme activity. Functional activity of the mutated Fet3ps was tested by measuring high affinity iron transport. Cells were grown in low iron galactose medium and then assayed with various concentrations of radiolabeled iron. Expression of wild type Fet3p (Leu-494) showed characteristic high affinity iron transport, and cells with vector alone showed no high affinity iron transport (Fig. 3). The L494I, L494K, or H489F proteins showed no evidence of any high affinity iron transport. The L494A and L494V showed some iron transport activity although at a significantly reduced rate. Those substitutions that severely disrupted iron transport activity also resulted in a loss of pPD and iron oxidase activity. The L494F substitution showed a modest level of iron transport activity in which the estimated Km for iron transport is relatively intact, but theVmax is markedly altered. The L494M substitution shows levels of high affinity iron transport activity comparable with wild type Fet3p. Although the approximate Vmaxfor iron uptake is unchanged, the Km of the L494M protein is approximately 2-fold higher than wild type. Many of the mutated Fet3ps displayed neither wild type oxidase or high affinity iron transport activity. Reduction in high affinity iron transport may result directly from loss of Fet3p oxidase activity or from a failure of inactive Fet3p to mediate Ftr1p cell surface localization. We visualized Ftr1p by indirect immunofluorescence in cells expressing mutated Fet3ps to determine whether these proteins could mediate Ftr1p cell surface localization (3Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Cells without the Ftr1p:Myc construct showed no specific fluorescence (Fig. 4 A). In the presence of Fet3p, the primary localization of Ftr1p was at the plasma membrane, with some remaining within intracellular vesicles (Fig.4 B). Not all cells possessing the Ftr1p:Myc construct exhibited fluorescence. The variability of immunofluorescence may be due to the Ftr1p induction time (6 h), production of endogenous Ftr1p rather than the plasmid-borne Ftr1p:Myc, or cellular variability of Ftr1p production. Cells that do not express Fet3p, however, displayed little Ftr1p:Myc fluorescence (Fig. 4 C), and the signal detected was present only within intracellular vesicles. All cells expressing the P4 mutant proteins showed detectable cell surface Ftr1p immunofluorescence (Fig. 4, D–J). These results indicate that all the mutant Fet3p proteins were capable of mediating the localization of Ftr1p to the cell surface. Residues within domains of Fet3p that are not found in non-iron-oxidizing multicopper oxidases also have been hypothesized to determine ferroxidase activity (10Murphy M.E. Lindley P.F. Adman E.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Of the domains and residues predicted to confer ferroxidase activity, only one domain was highly conserved between Fet3p and the Fet3p S. pombe homologue Fio1p (4Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This protein has also been shown to effect high affinity iron transport with a homologous S. pombe permease. We predicted that any domain important for ferroxidase activity should be conserved between these two homologous proteins since they function similarly. The conserved domain in Fet3p contained three residues hypothesized to be important for ferroxidase activity, glutamic acid 227, aspartic acid 228, and glutamic acid 330. To assess their importance, these three residues were changed to an alanine. Mutant Fet3ps E227A, D228A, and E330A were expressed at normal levels and demonstrated the same mobility on SDS-PAGE gels as wild type Fet3p (Fig. 5 A). All substitutions resulted in normal pPD and iron oxidase activity (Fig. 5, Band C). Thus, mutations of these residues did not affect protein function and did not alter the substrate specificity of Fet3pin vitro. These substitutions also did not substantially affect high affinity iron transport (Fig.6), although D228A consistently showed slightly lower levels of high affinity iron transport.Figure 6High affinity iron transport assays of cells containing Fet3p with E227A, D228A, and E330A mutations. Iron transport assays were done as described previously with Δfet3 cells containing the E227A, D228A, and E330A mutant Fet3p constructs.

Vect, vector; WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Data obtained in vivo and in vitro suggest that Fet3p acts as a ferroxidase to effect iron transport, converting ferrous to ferric iron, which is then transported through the permease Ftr1p (3Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 5de Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This activity presents a conundrum because yeast require the action of a cell surface ferrireductase to convert extracellular ferric iron to ferrous, which is then recognized by the high affinity iron transport system (12Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 13Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that the ferrireductase serves to solubilize the iron and free it from extracellular chelates. The ferroxidase activity of Fet3p may serve to impart specificity to the high affinity iron transport system. We wished to test whether high affinity iron transport required the ferroxidase activity of Fet3p. To test the prediction, we planned to generate a mutant Fet3p in which pPD oxidase activity was intact, and ferroxidase activity was lost. This seemed feasible, as others had suggested residues that might confer ferroxidase activity to Fet3p and ceruloplasmin (9Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 10Murphy M.E. Lindley P.F. Adman E.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Murphy et al. (10Murphy M.E. Lindley P.F. Adman E.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) predicted that acidic residues within regions of ceruloplasmin and Fet3p that were not homologous to other multicopper oxidases might be responsible for iron oxidase ability. Of the domains predicted, only one region was conserved between Fet3p and Fio1p. We mutated the three residues within this region, and all three mutants showed little alteration in pPD activity, ferroxidase activity, or the ability to mediate high affinity iron transport. Messerschmidt and Huber (9Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) suggested that a P4 leucine conferred ferroxidase activity to multicopper oxidases. We substituted methionine for the P4 leucine of Fet3p but did not find any significant alterations of pPD or ferroxidase activity. Thus, a P4 leucine is not obligate for ferroxidase activity, although it may be optimal since all P4 substitutions worked less well than leucine. Many of the substitutions to the P4 residue disrupted both pPD and ferroxidase activity, and one activity was never present without the other. Many of our substitutions were not predicted to alter enzyme activity (L494V, L494I, L494A); however they resulted in a dramatic loss of activity. This result suggests that type I copper binding or the generation of the active site surrounding the type I copper may involve other forces besides the ability of the P4 amino acid to act as a copper ligand. Inactive mutated Fet3p were used to define the relationship between Fet3p activity, Ftr1p localization, and iron transport. When Fet3p is absent, Ftr1p is not localized to the cell surface (3Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Thus, Fet3 disruption results in loss of high affinity iron transport and loss of Ftr1p on the cell surface. Whether the loss of high affinity transport is due to the lack of Ftr1p on the cell surface or due to the loss of Fet3p activity directly had not been determined. We have shown that Fet3p lacking oxidase activity does mediate Ftr1p localization to the cell surface. This result indicates that Fet3p, but not Fet3p activity, is required for Ftr1p localization. Fet3p oxidase activity, however, is required for high affinity iron transport, since cells harboring enzymatically inactive mutant Fet3p are unable to transport ferrous iron even though Ftr1p is on the cell surface. These findings establish that Fet3p oxidase activity is directly required for high affinity iron transport.

https://openalex.org/W2086845585,"We have used limited proteolysis to identify conformational changes in DNA gyrase. Gyrase exhibits a proteolytic fingerprint dominated by two fragments, one of ∼62 kDa, deriving from the A protein, and another of ∼25 kDa from the B protein. Quinolone binding to the enzyme-DNA complex induces a conformational change which is reflected in the protection of the C-terminal 47-kDa domain of the B protein. An active site mutant (Tyr<sup>122</sup> to Ser in the A protein) that binds quinolones but cannot cleave DNA still gives the quinolone proteolytic pattern, while stabilization of a cleaved-DNA intermediate by calcium ions does not reveal any protection, suggesting that the quinolone-induced conformational change is different from an ""open-gate"" state of the enzyme. A quinolone-resistant mutant of gyrase fails to give the characteristic quinolone-associated proteolytic signature. The ATP-induced dimerization of the B subunits is a key step of the gyrase mechanism. The proteolytic fingerprint of this conformation (stabilized by the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (ADPNP) shows a protection of the 43-kDa N-terminal domain of the B subunit. The presence of quinolones does not prevent dimerization since incubation of the enzyme-DNA complex with both ADPNP and quinolones gives rise to a complex whose proteolytic pattern retains the characteristic signature of dimerization but has lost the quinolone-induced protection. As a result, the quinolone-gyrase complex can still hydrolyze ATP, albeit with different kinetic characteristics. We interpret the proteolytic signatures observed in terms of four complexes of gyrase, each representing a particular conformational state."

These data suggest that IQGAP and Cdc42 are part of a cytoskeletal complex in Golgi membranes that may mediate Cdc42-regulated effects on the actin cytoskeleton in these membranes. Subcellular localization of signaling proteins is an important aspect of their function. Cdc42, a member of the Ras superfamily of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, has been shown to have a cytosolic form bound to the Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) 1The abbreviations used are: RhoGDIRho GDP-dissociation inhibitorGRDRasGAP-related domainCHOChinese hamster ovaryGSTglutathione S-transferasePI 3-Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseDTTdithiothreitolPLDphospholipase DHAhemagglutininPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

These different cellular locations are likely to account for the involvement of Cdc42 in a variety of processes in mammalian cells including the formation of actin-containing filopodia, cell-cycle progression, and stress-activated pathways which impact on gene transcription (5Bagrodia S.

Identification of a number of proteins that interact specifically with the GTP-bound state of Cdc42 has provided evidence that the activation of Cdc42 and its ability to subsequently bind multiple cellular targets may be responsible for its pleiotropic effects on cells. Association of Cdc42-GTP with the p21-activated kinases is most likely responsible for Cdc42-mediated effects on stress-activated pathways (5Bagrodia S. Derigard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

There are two isoforms that have been identified, IQGAP1 and IQGAP2, which share 62% sequence identity with each other and have the same domain structures. IQGAP2 is an 180-kDa, liver-specific protein (22Brill S. Li S. Lyman C.W. Church D.M. Wasmuth J.J. Weissbach L. Bernards A. Snijders A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), whereas the 189-kDa IQGAP1 has a wider distribution and is enriched in placenta, lung and kidney (23Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these proteins bind to Cdc42 in its GTP-bound state and inhibit its rate of GTP hydrolysis (19Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 21McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IQGAPs interact with Cdc42 through their COOH-terminal domains, which contain a region homologous to the RasGAP protein (19Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 22Brill S. Li S. Lyman C.W. Church D.M. Wasmuth J.J. Weissbach L. Bernards A. Snijders A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); however, IQGAPs do not bind Ras. The IQGAPs also contain domains homologous to the actin-binding protein, calponin, as well as IQ domains similar to those found in myosin-like proteins that bind calmodulin, suggesting that they may mediate the effects of Cdc42 on the actin cytoskeleton and may be responsive to changes in intracellular calcium (19Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 20Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, the IQGAPs contain a WW domain and an NH2-terminal repeat region, which is predicted to form a coiled-coil, possibly involved in IQGAP dimerization (25Bashour A. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The homology shared between IQGAPs and other actin-binding proteins would suggest a role for the IQGAPs in Cdc42-mediated cytoskeletal changes. Recently, Bashour et al. (25Bashour A. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) have shown that IQGAP binds to F-actin and that this interaction can be attenuated by calmodulin binding to IQGAP. Calmodulin has also been shown to abolish the association of Cdc42-GTP with IQGAP in a calcium-dependent manner (24Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have found that GTP-bound Cdc42 can form a ternary complex with IQGAP and F-actin (26Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Hart M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24443-24447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These findings argue that IQGAP may serve as an important interface between Cdc42 and F-actin. Given that a pool of Cdc42 exists in Golgi membranes, we set out to identify Golgi-associated proteins that served as binding partners for Cdc42. Here, we show that an ∼180-kDa rabbit liver Golgi membrane protein that specifically interacts with GTPγS-bound Cdc42 is IQGAP2. We describe the characteristics of the interactions of both IQGAP isoforms and Cdc42 with Golgi membranes and propose some possible roles for these interactions in Cdc42 function. The chemicals used in this study were obtained from Fisher. Nucleotides, glutathione-agarose, protein A-Sepharose, protease inhibitors, detergents, and antibodies to actin were obtained from Sigma. Rabbit anti-IQGAP antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. Matthew Hart, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, CA. Mouse anti-HA antibodies were obtained from Babco (Berkeley, CA). Mouse anti-10E6 (Golgi marker) antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. William Brown, Cornell University. Western blots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system from Amersham International (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Rabbit liver Golgi membranes were prepared as described (2Erickson J.W. Zhang C. Kahn R.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26850-26854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh livers were collected in ice-cold 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, plus protease inhibitors and homogenized in a Teflon/glass homogenizer (Type C; Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ). The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min to yield a microsomal pellet. This microsomal pellet was loaded onto the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient; after centrifugation, Golgi membrane fractions were collected from the 0.86/1.15 msucrose layer. Membranes were washed once in 250 mmsucrose, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, repelleted, and then resuspended in the same buffer, pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. For preparation of Golgi membranes from CHO cells, 20 × 150-mm plates of cells were collected by trypsinization and suspended in homogenization buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were swelled in this buffer for 20 min on ice and then centrifuged in a table-top refrigerated centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Cells were decanted and resuspended in 4 ml of homogenization buffer before being homogenized (i.e. 25 strokes with a stainless steel Dounce homogenizer (Thomas Scientific)). The cell homogenate was recentrifuged as above, and the resultant post-nuclear supernatant was diluted to about 10 ml with homogenization buffer and centrifuged 90 min at 45,000 rpm in a Ti70 (Beckman) rotor (149,000 × g). The microsomal pellet was further fractionated by loading it onto the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose density gradient and centrifuging for 3 h at 25,000 rpm (58,450 × g) in an SW 50.1 (Beckman) swinging bucket rotor. Gradient steps were 0.25, 0.86, and 1.15 m sucrose. The pellet was loaded in 1.22 m sucrose. Golgi membranes were collected from the 0.86/1.15 m sucrose layer, pooled, diluted with 250 mm sucrose and 100 mm Tris, and re-centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h in a Ti50 rotor. The pellets were resuspended to 1 mg/ml total protein in 250 mmsucrose, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and aliquots were stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin in 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, as a standard. In some cases, such as with proteins on beads, protein concentrations were estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. CHO cells stably transfected with triple hemagglutinin-tagged (HA) wild-type Cdc42Hs were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and anti-mycotic/antibiotic solution. Immunofluorescence experiments were carried out as described previously (2Erickson J.W. Zhang C. Kahn R.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26850-26854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) using a 1:50 dilution of the rabbit anti-IQGAP1 affinity-purified antibody that was raised against the amino-terminal half of insect cell-expressed IQGAP1 (4Hart M.J. Polakis P.G. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5990-6001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This antibody only detects IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 in Western blots of Golgi membrane fractions from rabbit liver or CHO cell lysates. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (28Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For GST-protein affinity precipitation experiments, rabbit liver Golgi membranes were suspended in 250 mmsucrose, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h in a Ti 50 rotor (105,000 × g). Membrane pellets (2.5 mg/ml protein) were resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and then the supernatant (400 μl) was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads containing GST-linked GTP-binding proteins. The GST-Cdc42, GST-Rac1, GST-RhoA, or GST-Ha-Ras were attached to glutathione-agarose beads (15 μl/sample, ∼10 μg of fusion protein) and incubated in 15 μl of TED (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) for 30 min at room temperature and then with either GTPγS (30 μm) plus MgCl2 (5 mm), GDP (30 μm) plus MgCl2 (5 mm), or with EDTA (30 mm) for 20 min at room temperature. These conditions are saturating with respect to nucleotide binding based on the upper limit estimates for theKd values for GTP and GDP (1 and 60 nm, respectively) from fluorescence studies (29Nomanbhoy T.K. Leonard D.A. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4602-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The different GST-GTP-binding proteins were incubated with solubilized Golgi membranes at 4 °C with rocking for 1.5 h. The glutathione-agarose beads were pelleted, washed (three times) with 400 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and the samples were resuspended in sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and silver staining or Western blotting. For immunoprecipitations, 500 μg of total Golgi membrane protein from wild-type CHO cells or from CHO cells stably transfected with HA-Cdc42 was solubilized in 2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and 250 mm sucrose for 30 min on ice. Insoluble material was pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 30 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The resultant supernatant was incubated with 3 μl of anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, 20 μm GTPγS, and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (three times) and then resuspended in sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Purified CHO cell Golgi membranes (∼15 μl of 1 mg/ml protein) were placed onto nickel-Formvar-carbon grids, 300 mesh, for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times for 10 min in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% ovalbumin), and then fixed with periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (30McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Golgi membranes on grids were permeabilized briefly (1 min) in 0.5% Triton X-100, washed as above, and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C at a concentration of 1:50 in wash buffer for mouse anti-HA-Cdc42 and rabbit anti-IQGAP1 antibodies and 1:1000 for rabbit anti-mannosidase II antibodies (a gift from Dr. William Brown, Cornell University). Grids were washed, treated with biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:50) for 1 h at 25 °C, washed again, and treated with 20 nm gold-linked anti-rabbit antibody and 15 nm gold-linked streptavidin-conjugated antibodies (1:50). After washing, samples were fixed with formalin, washed again, and stained with 0.2% phosphotungstic acid (3 × 2 s). Grids were viewed on a Zeiss 902 electron microscope in the Cornell Integrated Microscopy Center. CHO cell Golgi membranes (10–25 μg of total protein) were thawed quickly, washed with 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (sucrose/Tris buffer), and centrifuged twice in an Airfuge for 15 min at 30 p.s.i. (105,000 ×g). The membranes were then resuspended in 125 mm sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with the following exceptions: NaCl-treated samples contained 2 m NaCl, EDTA-treated samples contained no MgCl2, and pH 11 and pH 5 (0.5 m Na2CO3) samples contained no Tris. For RhoGDI-mediated solubilization assays, 10–25 μg of sucrose/Tris-washed CHO cell Golgi membranes were incubated with either 5.25 μm GST-RhoGDI or with an equal volume of GST elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol). In experiments using the carboxyl-terminal half of IQGAP1 (which contains the RasGAP-related domain, designated GRD), the GRD was added in quantities shown in the figures, or Glu-Glu elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added as a control. These additions were made to a reaction mix containing 50 mm Tris, 6 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 125 mmsucrose in a total volume of 60 μl. Samples were incubated 30 min at room temperature, and then membranes were pelleted by Airfuge centrifugation and total supernatants and pellets analyzed by Western blotting for IQGAP1 and (HA)-tagged Cdc42. For experiments with different guanine nucleotides, membranes were first incubated for 15 min in a sucrose/Tris buffer containing 1 mm EDTA to deplete nucleotides from the GTP-binding proteins and then the reaction mix, containing 1 mm GTPγS, 1 mm GDP, or 40 mm EDTA, was added. The GRD, which was a generous gift from Dr. Matthew Hart, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, CA, was expressed inSpodoptera frugiperda cells as a Glu-Glu-tagged protein and purified as described (19Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). 10–25 μg of washed CHO cell Golgi membranes were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with either sucrose/Tris buffer as control or with 2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 250 mm sucrose for detergent-insolubility experiments. For actin depolymerizing experiments, washed CHO cell Golgi membranes were treated with either sucrose/Tris buffer or 2% Triton X-100, 1 μm DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, or 0.6m KI as indicated. Actin depolymerizing conditions were adapted from Cano et al. and Robertson et al. (31Cano M.L. Cassimeris L. Fechheimer M. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Robertson D. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4565-4572PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation, membranes were centrifuged for 30 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 14,000 rpm, and total supernatants and pellets were analyzed by 5–15% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. We have reported that a large pool of the low molecular weight GTP-binding protein Cdc42 is localized to the Golgi apparatus (2Erickson J.W. Zhang C. Kahn R.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26850-26854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, we set out to identify proteins from Triton X-100 solubilized rabbit liver Golgi membranes which interacted specifically with Cdc42 by using GST-Cdc42 fusion proteins as affinity reagents. The GST-Cdc42 was loaded with either GTPγS or GDP, or was nucleotide-depleted by addition of EDTA, in order to probe for proteins which bind to a specific nucleotide state of Cdc42. GST alone on beads was used as a control for nonspecific binding. Fig.1 A shows that an approximately 180-kDa protein co-precipitated with Cdc42 in its GTPγS-bound state but not with Cdc42-GDP, nucleotide-depleted Cdc42 (EDTA-treated), or with GST alone. Our previous work had identified similarly sized proteins in the cytosol as IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 (21McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and thus we thought it likely that the 180-kDa Golgi membrane protein was also an IQGAP. In support of this idea, the 180-kDa Golgi protein (designated Golgi p180) showed many of the same characteristics as the cytosolic IQGAPs. First, like the cytosolic forms of IQGAP, Golgi p180 also bound to Rac1 but not to RhoA nor Ha-Ras (Fig. 1 B). In this particular experiment, we used an excess of the Rac protein, which gave rise to a large band of p180. However, we routinely observed that Golgi p180 bound Rac1 more weakly than Cdc42. Second, like the cytosolic IQGAPs (21McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), Golgi p180 was able to form a stable complex with GTP-bound GST-Cdc42 (Fig.1 C). This is due to the ability of IQGAPs to inhibit the GTPase activity of Cdc42 as indicated in real-time fluorescence assays of Cdc42 labeled with a fluorescent reported group (6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]hexanote). 2T. Nomanbhoy and R. A. Cerione, manuscript in preparation.Finally, similar to the cytosolic IQGAPs (21McCallum S.J. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21732-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), binding of Golgi p180 to Cdc42 was competed by the p21-activated kinase, a putative target for Cdc42, but not by the Cdc42-GAP (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows that the Golgi p180 protein reacts with an antibody raised against the amino-terminal half of human IQGAP1, which recognizes both IQGAP1 and IQGAP2 from rabbit liver cytosol. The Golgi protein, precipitated with GST-Cdc42-GTPγS and recognized by the IQGAP antibody, migrated with the same mobility as IQGAP2, which appears to be the predominant isoform in the liver (22Brill S. Li S. Lyman C.W. Church D.M. Wasmuth J.J. Weissbach L. Bernards A. Snijders A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). IQGAP2 from Golgi membranes appears to bind specifically to the GTPγS-bound form of Cdc42. Given that IQGAP2 is liver-specific (22Brill S. Li S. Lyman C.W. Church D.M. Wasmuth J.J. Weissbach L. Bernards A. Snijders A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and that IQGAP1 is more widely distributed (23Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether IQGAP1 is Golgi-localized in cells that do not express IQGAP2. As shown in Fig.3, we found that in CHO cells that stably over-expressed epitope-tagged (HA) Cdc42, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate IQGAP1 from Golgi membranes using the anti-HA (12CA5) antibody. Fig. 4 shows negative stain electron micrographs of these purified CHO cell Golgi membranes, which have been treated with primary antibodies raised against mannosidase II, IQGAP and HA-Cdc42. In panel A, mannosidase II is labeled with 20 nm gold particles and HA-Cdc42 is labeled with 15 nm gold particles (see arrows). In panel B, HA-Cdc42 is labeled with 15 nm gold and IQGAP is labeled with 20 nmgold (see arrows). In addition, we found that in immunofluorescence experiments in Swiss-3T3 cells, we could detect IQGAP1 staining to a perinuclear region which overlaps with a Golgi resident marker, 10E6 (Fig. 5). These experiments show that IQGAP1 does have a Golgi membrane-bound pool, as well as the previously observed cytosolic and plasma membrane-bound pools (19Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P.

To understand more about the physiological role of each isoform, we have employed the mouse system. We found that although the α and β isoforms are present in the mouse, the γ isoform is not. The α isoform protein was detected clearly in most adult tissues, whereas the β isoform protein was almost undetectable except in spleen, testis, thymus, and lung. On the other hand, mRNAs of both isoforms were detectable in all tissues we examined. High levels of the β isoform protein was detected in peritoneal exudate macrophage cells in adult mouse as well as in cultured fibroblasts, together with the α isoform. The α isoform was expressed at a constant level throughout the embryonic stages we examined, whereas the β isoform protein was detected at the mid-stages of development and increased to levels almost equal to those of the α isoform during the late stages of embryogenesis. Therefore, unlike the α isoform, expression of the β isoform protein is restricted in adult tissues. Moreover, we showed that α and β isoforms were colocalized within the same focal adhesion plaques, and cytoplasmic pools of both isoforms exist in the perinuclear area, colocalized with the Golgi apparatus.

Paxillin was originally identified as a substrate for the v-Src tyrosine kinase (1Glenney Jr., J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and shown to be highly localized at focal adhesions in fibroblasts (2Turner C.E. Glenney Jr., J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). A number of results indicate the importance of paxillin in the focal adhesion assembly and the integrin-mediated signal transduction. Paxillin can interact directly with several focal adhesion proteins including vinculin, talin, and integrin β1 (2Turner C.E. Glenney Jr., J.R. Burridge K. J.

Paxillin also binds directly to signal transducers of protein tyrosine kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (5Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar), thus creating the binding sites for the Src homology 2 domains of Csk and Crk (9Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H.

Inhibition of this tyrosine phosphorylation blocks the formation of the focal adhesions and cell cycle progression into S-phase (8Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). We have also shown that paxillin is hyperphosphorylated on serine and down-regulated during mitosis where the cell adherence to the extracellular matrices is greatly reduced (12Yamaguchi R. Mazaki Y. Hirota K. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1753-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, papilloma E6 protein binds to paxillin, and this binding correlates with disruption of the actin cytoskeletal architecture in the virus-infected cells (13Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Tong X. Salgia R. Li J.L. Griffin J.D. Howley P.M. J. Biol.

Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human (4Salgia R. Lin J.-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and we identified two more human isoforms, β and γ (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The β and γ isoforms of paxillin are generated by the insertion of specific exons into the same site as the α isoform. We have shown that mRNA of the α isoform is expressed in most normal human tissues, whereas mRNA of the β and the γ isoforms are almost undetectable. On the other hand, human cancer cells and monoblast cells cultured in vitro have been shown to express these isoforms simultaneously. Notably, expression of the γ isoform is up-regulated during the differentiation of floating monoblast cells into adherent monocyte/macrophage-like cells. Moreover, each isoform exhibits different binding properties to focal adhesion proteins, suggesting distinct physiological roles for each isoform. Because one purpose of analyzing paxillin isoforms is to delineate and understand their possible roles in cancer metastasis, we began with analysis of human material (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, as an extension of our previous study, we analyzed paxillin in the murine system. We first isolated the murine genomic DNA fragments corresponding to the human β- and γ-specific exons. Our analysis revealed that rodents do not bear an exon that is specific to the γ isoform, although both the α and β isoforms are present. We present evidence that the γ-specific exon in humans evolved from ancestral genomic sequences that are also present in rodents. We also examined the expression of paxillin protein isoforms in adult and embryonic tissues and their subcellular localization. The possible biological relevance of the difference in the γ isoform between human and mouse is also discussed. 129/Sv mice and BALB/c mice were obtained from National Institute for Genetics (Shizuoka, Japan). Peritoneal exudate cells were isolated from BALB/c mice 4 days after injecting Brewer's thioglycolate medium. Hepatocellular carcinomas were developed in transgenic mice carrying the SV40 T antigen under the control of the albumin promoter (16Hino O. Kitagawa T. Nomura K. Ohtake K. Cui L. Furuta Y. Aizawa S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1991; 82: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Embryos were obtained from BALB/c mice. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. Standard methods (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used for DNA and RNA manipulations, unless otherwise stated. A λDASH genomic library of the 129/Sv mouse was screened using human paxillin DNA fragments corresponding to the β- and γ-specific exon (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as probes. After hybridization in a solution containing 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C for 16 h, filters were washed for 10 min at room temperature with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and washed three times with 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 20 min. Positive phage clones were then isolated, and their inserted genomic DNA fragments were cut out usingEcoRI or XhoI and ligated into pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After transformation of the resulting plasmid into Escherichia coli JM109, each clone was isolated and subjected to restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing analysis. High molecular weight DNAs isolated from tails of 129/Sv mice, BALB/c mice, Mus muscalus molossinus, andMus spretus (the latter two were a gift from K.

Each paxillin isoform cDNA in pBabePuro vector (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol.

NheI-XbaI fragments were then isolated from this pEGFP-C1 construct, blunt-ended, and ligated into pBabePuro vector cleaved with SnaBI. Formyc-paxillin β construction,BglI-EcoRI fragments of paxillin β cDNA were isolated from the pGEX/paxillin β (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol.

The ligated fragments were then ligated into pBabePuro vector cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI. Each resulting plasmid DNA was confirmed by sequencing. The tagged paxillin plasmid DNAs were transfected into BOSC 23 cells by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (18Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 15: 8392-8396Crossref Scopus (2305) Google Scholar), and recombinant viruses bearing pBabePuro/paxillins were collected 48 h after transfection. NIH 3T3 cells were then infected with these viruses. After culturing the infected cells for 1 week in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) cells were harvested and analyzed for the expression of paxillin by immunoblotting as described below. Cell extracts from whole embryos or tissues isolated from 5–6-week-old 129/Sv mice were prepared using RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3 μg/ml pepstatin A). The materials were first homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in a buffer without detergents, then mixed with the detergents and incubated on ice for 10 min with occasional vortexing. After clarification from insoluble materials by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each 3 mg of protein recovered was then immunoprecipitated using an anti-paxillin antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Inc., Lexington, KY) coupled to protein G-Sepharose. In the case of peritoneal-excluded macrophages and cultured fibroblasts, each 300 μg of cell lysate prepared in RIPA buffer was used for the immunoprecipitation. After being washed four times with RIPA buffer, samples were boiled in Laemmli's SDS sample buffer, separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to membrane filters (Immobilin P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After blocking with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan), filter membranes were probed with polyclonal antibody Ab 199–217 and anti-paxillin β polyclonal antibody as described previously (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The antibodies retained on filter membranes were then detected by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc., West Grove, PA) and visualized by an enzyme-linked chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were subjected to immunoblotting analysis sequentially with different antibodies, after stripping according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For detection of each paxillin isoform, we blotted filters with anti-β antibody first, and then with Ab 199–217, which recognizes the α and β isoforms (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with BSA as a standard. Total RNAs from tissues were prepared using Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cDNA synthesis was performed in a mixture containing 2 μg of total RNA, random primers, and reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). For RT-PCR detection of paxillin isoform mRNAs, a combination of a sense primer of 5′-AACAAGCAGAAGTCAGCAGAGCC-3′ (sense pan-paxillin primer) and an antisense primer of 5′-CTAGCTTGTTCAGGTCGGAC-3′ was used (see Fig. 4). For the detection of the paxillin β isoform transcript, a combination of the sense pan-paxillin primer and an antisense primers of 5′-CTCTCCATCCACTCTCTGTT-3′ was used (see Fig. 4). For detection of β-actin mRNAs, 5′-GCATTGTTACCAACTGGGAC-3′, and an antisense primer, 5′-AGGCAGCTCATAGCTCTTCT-3′ were used. The amplification was carried out in a 50-μl mixture containing 1 μl of the above cDNA product, 1 mm each of the sense and antisense primers, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq GoldTM (Perkin-Elmer), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, and 0.2 mm dNTPs. The reaction conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 9 min and 32 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min), followed by a final extension step of 5 min at 72 °C. For localization ofmyc-tagged paxillin isoforms and cellular proteins, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. The fixed cells were incubated for 10 min with 50 mm ammonium chloride in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After being washed with PBS, the cells were soaked in PBS containing 2% BSA for 30 min followed by incubation with primary antibodies in PBS containing 2% BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) in PBS containing 2% BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. After being washed with PBS, slides were mounted with PBS containing 50% glycerol and 0.1% p-phenylenediamine (Acros Organics, NJ). Photographs were taken using MRC1024 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). Antibodies used for the immunostaining analysis were against the myc-tag epitope (9E10; Babco, Richmond, CA), vinculin (VIN11–5; Sigma), GRP78 (19Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Semin. Cell. Biol. 1990; 1: 65-72PubMed Google Scholar) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and Golgi 58-kilodalton protein (20Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (clone 58K-9; Sigma). EGFP-tagged paxillin isoforms were detected by their autofluorescence after cells were incubated for 6–8 h at 30 °C and then fixed as above. F-actin was visualized with BODIPY 581/591 phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The β and γ isoforms of human paxillin are generated by insertion of specific exons into Lys-277 and Phe-278 of the α isoform (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Using human paxillin cDNAs encompassing β- and γ-specific sequences as probes, we isolated five clones from a murine 129/Sv genomic library (Fig. 1 A). After the subcloning of each genomic DNA fragment into pBluescript, restriction enzyme mapping and partial nucleotide-sequencing analysis (data not shown) revealed 14.4 kilobase pairs of paxillin genomic sequence. We then focused on the region encompassing the exon encoding Lys-277 to the exon encoding Phe-278 of the α isoform (Fig. 1 B). Sequencing analysis revealed that the β-specific exon, with 85% homology to that of the human β-specific exon, was found about 4.7-kilobase pairs downstream of the exon encoding Lys-277. Of note, the position of the mouse β exon relative to 5′- and 3′-flanking exons is similar to that of the human β exon (Fig. 1 B). The deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the human and mouse β exons exhibited 71% homology. The γ-specific human exon lies 142 nucleotides downstream of the β exon, and connects directly to the 3′-flanking exon encoding Phe-278 of the α isoform (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the β exon and its 3′-flanking exon in the 129/Sv mouse showed some 62% homology with the corresponding region in the human genome (Figs. 1 B and2). However, an exon corresponding to the human γ exon was not found in this region. The same nucleotide sequences were obtained from all five original phage clones. We then PCR-amplified the sequences corresponding to this region from high molecular weight DNAs isolated from 129/Sv mouse, BALB/c mouse,M. muscalus molossinus and M. spretus. Genomic paxillin sequences from these different strains or sub-species of rodents also showed homology to each other and did not contain an exon corresponding to the human γ exon (Fig. 2). Moreover, we have sequenced the entire region of the 129/Sv mouse genome from the exon encoding Lys-277 to the exon encoding Phe-278 of the α isoform shown in Fig. 1 B and did not find the γ exon (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the mouse genome does not encode the γ isoform of paxillin. We then examined protein expression of the α and β isoforms in normal adult tissues of mice. We used polyclonal antibody Ab 199–217, which was made against amino acids 199–217 of the human α isoform and thereby recognizes all three human isoforms (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Amino acids 199–217 of human paxillin are 84.2% identical (with 100% similarity) to the corresponding amino acids of murine paxillin (data not shown), and this polyclonal antibody recognized mouse and human paxillin equally well. As shown in Fig. 3 A, all the tissues examined expressed paxillin as detected by Ab 199–217. The highest level of paxillin expression was observed in spleen. On the other hand, probing the filters with polyclonal anti-β antibody revealed that only marginal levels of the β isoform were expressed in most of these tissues. The polyclonal anti-β antibody was originally made against human β-specific amino acid sequence (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but was equally reactive with the mouse β isoform and the human β isoform, as assessed with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of the human and mouse β isoforms (data not shown). Moreover, the same amount of recombinant α and β paxillin were included in each gel as internal standards, and the immunoblots were probed first with the anti-β, then Ab 199–217. Therefore, the paxillin bands detected with Ab 199–217 in Fig. 3 A appear to represent primarily paxillin α. The expression of the α isoform mRNA can be detected by RT-PCR independently of that of the β isoform, and we have confirmed the α isoform mRNA expression in these tissues (Fig. 4 A). Using human RNA blot filters purchased from a commercial source, we have shown previously that the mRNAs of the β and the γ isoforms were almost undetectable in normal human tissues (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in mice, significant levels of the β protein expression were detected in spleen, testis, thymus, and lung, although the levels of the β isoform in these tissues were still much lower than those of the α isoform, except in lung. Similar levels of β isoform expression were also detected in mouse bone marrow cells (data not shown). Moreover, the transcripts specific to the mouse paxillin β isoform were clearly detected in all the tissues examined, although the levels were again much lower than those of the α isoform in most tissues (Fig. 4 B). We also examined β isoform expression in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (16Hino O. Kitagawa T. Nomura K. Ohtake K. Cui L. Furuta Y. Aizawa S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1991; 82: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The paxillin protein expression was similar to that observed in normal liver with an undetectable level of the β isoform (Fig. 3 A). We then examined embryos. Immunoblotting of all embryonic protein samples revealed two distinct bands reacting with Ab 199–217. Probing the same filters with the anti-β antibody indicated that the upper bands in each preparation correspond to the β isoform (Fig. 3 B). The lower bands, thus, appeared to correspond to the α isoform. Moreover, it should be noted that a fraction of paxillin in embryonic tissues is known to be tyrosine phosphorylated (21Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), causing smearing of the bands when separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as seen in Fig. 3 B. Again, the expression of the α isoform and the β isoform genes was confirmed by RT-PCR methods (data not shown), and the same amount of recombinant proteins was included on each gel as an internal standard. Judging from the lower bands (Fig. 3 B), the level of isoform α per μg of embryo cell extract remained essentially constant throughout different stages of embryonic development that we examined (9.5–17.5 days post coitus (dpc)). Expression of the β isoform protein was clearly detected in 9.5- and 11.5-dpc embryos, although the levels of the β isoform were two to three times lower than those of the α isoform. In 15.5- and 17.5-dpc embryos, however, the β isoform expression was almost equal to that of the α isoform. We have reported that the human monoblast cell line U937 expresses all three paxillin isoforms (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The same was true with another human monoblast cell line, THP-1. 2Y. Mazaki and H. Sabe, unpublished results. Paxillin isoform expression in mouse monocyte/macrophage cells was therefore examined. We isolated peritoneal exudate cells/macrophages from adult mice treated with thioglycolate. As shown in Fig. 3 C, these cells expressed the α and β isoforms at similar levels. Smearing of the bands was primarily because of phosphorylation (data not shown). We also examined isoform expression in cultured NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and found that the cells expressed both isoforms simultaneously. Unlike the peritoneal exudate cells/macrophages, however, the level of expression of the β isoform was significantly lower than that of the α isoform (Fig. 3 C). The same was true with Swiss 3T3 and 3Y1 fibroblasts (data not shown). We next examined the subcellular localization of the each isoform in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Upon solubilization of adherent fibroblast cells, paxillin was recovered partly in the soluble fraction and partly in a particulate fraction (data not shown). We made epitope-tagged constructs of each paxillin isoform; the α isoform with an EGFP-tag, and the β isoform with a myc-tag. As shown in Fig.5 a-c, no significant difference in subcellular localization was observed, and a significant fraction of each isoform was indeed localized to the focal adhesions. Both isoforms were also detected in certain regions of the cell periphery. In addition to these regions, we noticed that immunostaining of endogenous paxillin with the anti-paxillin antibody gave rise to a remarkable staining of the perinuclear regions of membranous organelle structures in fibroblasts (data not shown). Because this kind of immunostaining often gives a nonspecific signal around perinuclear regions, we were not confident of the localization of paxillin in these regions. However, the localization of paxillin at the perinuclear regions was also seen with EGFP-tagged paxillin α (Fig. 5 a), withmyc-tagged paxillin β (Fig. 5 b), withmyc-tagged paxillin α, and with EGFP-tagged paxillin β (data not shown). Neither fluorescence from EGFP per se nor the staining of mock-transfected cells with an anti-myc antibody gave rise to staining around these perinuclear regions (data not shown). We thus conclude that a significant fraction of paxillin is localized to the perinuclear regions in adhered fibroblasts. A similar localization was observed with Swiss 3T3 and 3Y1 fibroblasts (data not shown). Colocalization of paxillin with vinculin and F-actin was also examined with epitope-tagged constructs of paxillin α (Fig. 5,d–i) and paxillin β (data not shown). Endogenous vinculin was colocalized with paxillin α and β at focal contacts and the cell periphery (Fig. 5, d–f). It is noteworthy that a minor fraction of vinculin was also seen at the perinuclear regions (Fig.5 e). However, unlike paxillin, the relative amount of vinculin in these perinuclear regions was less than that observed in focal contacts (Fig. 5 f). The pattern of F-actin localization appeared to be similar to that of paxillin, but only a small population of the two proteins were colocalized (Fig. 5,g–i). Paxillin appears to localize next to the front edge of F-actin at each focal adhesion. To examine to which regions paxillin was localized within the perinuclear area, we visualized the submembranous structures of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Paxillin was not colocalized with the GRP78 protein used as an endoplasmic reticulum marker, although the overall pattern of GRP78 expression overlapped with that of the perinuclear localization of paxillin (Fig. 5,j–l). Colocalization of the Golgi 58-kilodalton protein with paxillin was observed (Fig. 5, m–o). Subpopulation of paxillin also seemed to be localized to the trans-Golgi network, which is characterized by the condensed localization of the 58-kilodalton protein (Fig. 5, m–o). We have shown in this paper that the mouse genome encodes the α and β isoforms of paxillin but not the γ isoform. Mouse genomic sequences adjacent to the 3′-end of the β exons showed significant sequence homology to the human γ exon, yet comprise introns in rodents. Therefore, the γ-specific exon may have evolved from ancestral sequences also present in rodents. Our previous analysis with human system showed that the mRNA of the α isoform of paxillin is expressed in most normal tissues, whereas isoform β and γ messages are not (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our analysis of the murine system confirmed that the α isoform protein is indeed expressed in all normal adult tissues we examined, whereas the β isoform protein is expressed only at marginal levels or is almost undetectable. However, it should be noted that several tissues such as spleen, testis, thymus, and lung express detectable levels of the β isoform protein. A subset of cells in spleen, testis, and thymus are not static but motile. In lung, a number of leukocytes invade and are activated; and we showed that high levels of the β isoform protein were indeed observed in peritoneal exudate cells/macrophage cells in adult mice. Cultured fibroblasts also expressed the β isoform. Moreover, high levels of the β isoform protein were observed during embryogenesis. Therefore, there is a significant difference in the pattern of expression between the α and β isoforms proteins. Expression of the β isoform appears to be nonessential for maintenance of most normal tissues that have completed morphogenesis. The β isoform, on the other hand, seems to be tightly correlated with the tissues during embryogenesis or exhibiting marked changes in cellular content. It also should be noted, however, that we could not find tissues or cells that express the β isoform independently of the α isoform. In contrast to β isoform protein expression, the β-specific transcripts were clearly detected by the RT-PCR method in all the tissues we examined. Therefore, there may be some mechanism to limit the translation and/or the steady-state protein level of the β isoform in most of normal adult tissues. It has been shown that many cadherin-negative cell lines accumulate a normal amount of β-catenin mRNA but only a low level of β-catenin protein (22Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 23Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the β isoform mRNA in tissues in which the β isoform protein is not normally expressed may enable a cell to respond quickly to physiological changes such as a wound healing, during which cells may require the β isoform protein for motility. We wanted to examine the relationship between cancer cell metastatic activity and expression of the β isoform, as implicated in our previous study (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult in rodents to obtain cancer tissues that metastasized from a primary tumor. We have only been able to examine hepatocellular carcinomas in transgenic mice bearing the SV40 large T antigen gene (16Hino O. Kitagawa T. Nomura K. Ohtake K. Cui L. Furuta Y. Aizawa S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1991; 82: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These liver cancer cells are not metastasized and show no metastatic activity. In these cells, no significant expression of the β isoform was detected, whereas the α isoform was expressed at levels similar to those of normal liver (see Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, the β isoform is not always induced when cells are transformed. We showed that both isoforms are indeed localized to focal adhesion plaques. Among focal contacts in a single cell, there is no selective localization of either isoform. Focal adhesion proteins in general are believed to have relatively large cytoplasmic pools. Our analysis of confocal images indicated that both isoforms of paxillin in cultured fibroblasts are not present throughout the cytosol but rather are primarily associated with perinuclear submembranous structures that colocalized with the Golgi apparatus. Vinculin, another focal adhesion protein, was similarly localized, although the relative amount of its perinuclear localization was much less than that of paxillin. Several small GTP-binding proteins including Rho and Rac are involved in the regulation of focal adhesions and the dynamic regions of the cell periphery (24Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3840) Google Scholar, 25Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3081) Google Scholar), and it is noteworthy that the myosin Myr4 protein bearing Rho-GTPase-activating activity, for example, localizes to the Golgi apparatus (26Muller R.T. Honnert U. Reinhard J. Bahler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2039-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is well documented that integrins are transported to the cell surface and are internalized continuously (27Dalton S.L. Scharf E. Briesewitz R. Marcantonio E.E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) via coated pits (28Raub T.J. Kuentzel S.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 407-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Paxillin may not be essential for the translocation of integrins to the plasma membrane (29Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet well established how and where intracytoplasmic proteins are transported to and assemble with the cytoplasmic domains of integrins. Orchestration of protein assembly among different focal contacts in a single cell may also be necessary for cell motility. Paxillin itself is a soluble protein and has no Golgi retention signal, and thus identification of the protein(s) that anchors paxillin to the perinuclear submembranous structures or the Golgi apparatus may provide clues for further understanding the regulation of focal assemblies, as well as cell motility. It is surprising that rodents do not have the γ isoform of paxillin. The γ isoform of paxillin is expressed in human monoblast cells, and its expression is enhanced severalfold during maturation of the cells into macrophage-like cells (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), implicating the γ isoform in integrin avidity, cell motility, and trans-invasion. Moreover, we recently found that primary preparations of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and vein endothelial cells when cultured in vitro express relatively high levels of the γ isoform protein.2 Unlike the other two isoforms, the γ isoform only weakly interacts with focal adhesion kinase (15Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The γ isoform-specific exon, on the other hand, contains a proline-rich sequence that can bind to certain Src homology 3 domains in vitro. Thus, the γ isoform appears to participate in transmitting an integrin-mediated signal, distinct from signals transmitted by the α and β isoforms. There may be a number of differences between human and mouse with regards to cell adhesions and signalings. For example, CD58 (LFA-3) (30Wallner B.P. Frey A.Z. Tizard R. Mattaliano R.J. Hession C. Sanders M.E. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is expressed in several types of human cells including monocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and vein endothelial cells, and acts as a counter receptor for CD2-mediating cell adhesions between killer T cells and their target cells (31Le P.T. Vollger L.W. Haynes B.F. Singer K.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4541-4547PubMed Google Scholar, 32Singer K.H. Le P.T. Denning S.M. Whichard L.P. Haynes B.F. J. Invest.

Immunol. 1991; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), appears to be absent in rodents. In rodents, CD48, which is also present in humans, seems to involve the function of the human CD58 (34Staunton D.E. Thorley-Lawson D.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3695-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Kato K. Koyanagi M. Okada H. Takanashi T. Wong Y.W. Williams A.F. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp.

Elucidation of the role of the γ isoform may unveil differences in cell adhesion mechanisms and its signaling between human and mouse. This may also contribute to our evaluation of rodents as animal model systems for human diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis, and asthma and to the development of medical strategies that target the cells involved in these diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2036890506,"Retinal-pigmented epithelial (RPE) cell survival is critical to the maintenance of the function of the neural retinal and in the development of various retina degenerations. We investigated molecular mechanisms involved in this function by assessing apoptosis in RPE cells following serum deprivation. Apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal is lower in aged RPE cells because of higher endogenous acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF1) synthesis and secretion. These experiments examined several aspects of FGF signaling and the contribution of endogenous FGF1 to activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). In aged RPE cells, FGFR1 was rapidly activated, and its autophosphorylation followed the kinetics of endogenous FGF1 secretion, before the onset of apoptosis. ERK2 phosphorylation, activity, and de novo synthesis increased at the same time. In marked contrast, no de novo JNK1 synthesis was observed. MEK1 inhibition resulted in lower levels of ERK2 activation and synthesis and higher levels of apoptosis. Treatment with neutralizing anti-FGF1 or blocking anti-FGFR1 antibodies mimics these effects. Thus, this study strongly suggests that the survival-increasing effect of FGF1 in aged RPE cells is because of an autocrine/paracrine loop in which the ERK2 cascade plays a pivotal role.

FGF1 and 2 lack a classic signal peptide (6Abraham J.A. Whang J.L. Tumolo A. Mergia A. Friedman J. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C.

Science. 1986; 233: 241-244Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar), implying that they are not secreted by the classical secretion pathway. There is evidence that FGF1 and 2 are exported from the cell and subsequently act as autocrine or paracrine factors (8Vlodavski I. Arias Y. Atzman R. Fuks Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 140: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1129-1205Crossref Scopus (529) Google Scholar). FGF1 and 2 exert their effects via high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFR1–FGFR4) (for reviews, see Refs. 10Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys.

All cell layers in normal adult retina produce FGF1, as cells no longer differentiate or proliferate. The pattern of FGF1 production suggests that FGF1 may be involved in the regulation of specific spatio-temporal events, including proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival in the retina. In vivo, despite the presence of FGFs in the retinal interphotoreceptor matrix, RPE cells have a limited proliferation capacity consistent with the normal increase in retinal space associated with growth and age. In adult, RPE cells cannot dividein vivo, but they may still require survival factors to inhibit their apoptosis. Cell survival and proliferation may be determined by the amount of factor available and the amount of receptor produced (20Collins M.K. L Perkins G.R. Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Nieto M.A. Lopez-Rivas A. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). RPE cells produce FGF1 (21Schweigerer L. Malerstein B. Neufeld G. Gospodarowicz D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), FGFR (22Sternfeld M.D. Robertson J.E. Shipley G.D. Tsai J. Robertson J.T. Curr.

Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 170-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in culture. In RPE cells, ERKs, also known as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, undergo rapid and biphasic activation in response to exogenous FGF1 and FGF2 (24Guillonneau X. Regnier-Ricard F. Berou E. Brickaert M.C. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 170-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Unlike exogenous FGF1, endogenous FGF1 is not a mitogenic factor. It is a survival factor, both for nondividing epithelial cells (25Renaud F. Oliver L. Desset S. Tassin J. Romquin N. Courtois T. Laurent M.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and for neuronal cells of the PC12 line (26Renaud F. Desset S. Oliver L. Gimenez-Gallego G. Van Obberghen E. Courtois Y. Laurent M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2801-2811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the FGF2-stimulated release of endogenous FGF1 is associated with lower levels of apoptosis in RPE cells (27Guillonneau X. Regnier-Ricard F. Dupuis C. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas FGF1 secreted by RPE cells and purified from culture medium causes RPE and retinal Müller glial (RMG) cell proliferation and survival via ERK2 activation (28Guillonneau X. Regnier-Ricard F. Dupuis C. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. Growth Factors. 1997; 15: 95-112Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These data suggested these may be an FGF1 autocrine/paracrine pathway supporting RPE cell survival. FGF activity is regulated in RPE cell subcultures (24Guillonneau X. Regnier-Ricard F. Berou E. Brickaert M.C. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 170-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). So we used an in vitro approach to investigate several aspects of FGF signaling, including the production and excretion of endogenous FGF1, the expression and autophosphorylation of FGFR1 (the major FGF receptor in RPE cells), and the production and activation of ERK2 in quiescent, confluent RPE cell subcultures, as a function of cell survival. RPE cell cultures from bovine eyes were made to age in vitro by repeated culture passage, an aging strategy termed replicative senescence. This study shows that the amount of FGF1 controls cell survival by FGFR1 activation and by affecting the activation and the production of ERK2. Therefore, long term activation of MAP kinase and up-regulation of its production may be involved in integrating and transmitting transmembrane signals for cell survival.RESULTSAged RPE Cells Are More Resistant to Apoptosis and Synthesize More FGF1 after Serum WithdrawalApoptosis Is Lower in Aged RPE Cell Cultures in Serum-free ConditionsLater passages (5th to 11th) of RPE cells were less sensitive to apoptosis after serum withdrawal than early passages (Fig.1 A). We used the TUNEL method to identify PCD at the single cell level and found that, until day 3 of culture, there was less than 1.1% TUNEL-labeled nuclei in late RPE cells. This is similar to the value obtained for cells cultured in the presence of serum. In aged RPE cells, the number of cells undergoing PCD doubled on day 5 and was 5.2-fold higher on day 7. Early passages of RPE cell cultures in the absence of serum underwent apoptosis more rapidly than later passages. In early passages, the number of cells undergoing PCD increased and was 2.2-fold higher (2% PCD) on day 3, 13-fold higher (10.5% PCD) on day 5, and 21-fold higher (16.8% PCD) on day 7 than the basal level of PCD in RPE cells on day 1 of culture (0.8% PCD).Higher Levels of FGF1 Accumulation and Secretion in Aged RPE Cell Cultures in Serum-free ConditionsWe quantified FGF1 production during RPE cell serial passage. Later passages of RPE cells accumulated and secreted more FGF1 than early passages (Fig. 1, B andC). The kinetics of accumulation and secretion of FGF1 also differed between late and early passages. Analysis of FGF protein level by EIA showed that the amount of FGF1 accumulated on day one in cells of late passages (45 ± 1 ng/ml of total protein) was 3.7-fold higher than that in cells of early passages (12 ± 0.5 ng/ml of total protein). The amplitude of the peak of accumulated FGF1 (87 ± 5 ng/mg of total protein) on day 3 was eight-fold higher in late passage RPE cells than in early passage cells (10 ± 2 ng/mg of total protein). Thereafter, the amount of FGF1 decreased on day 4 and then reached a plateau (48 ± 4 ng/mg of total protein). In contrast, the amount of endogenous FGF1 in early passage RPE cells did not change during the first 3 days of culture (Fig. 1 C). The concentration of FGF1 then increased significantly and was 2.5-fold higher than the basal level on the 4th day of culture (29 ± 2.5 ng/mg of total protein). It reached a plateau by the 7th day of culture.In addition, the amount of secreted FGF1 on day 1 in the absence of serum by late passage RPE cells (10 ng/10 ml of culture medium) was higher than that detected in early RPE cell passages (3.2 ng/10 ml of culture medium) (Fig. 1 B). Secretion of FGF1 from aged RPE cells was fairly constant throughout the 7-day culture period (10–13 ng/10 ml of culture medium) and did not follow the kinetics of endogenous FGF1 production. The secretion of FGF1 in early passage cells followed a similar pattern to that of the synthesis of FGF1 (Fig.1 C). Note that the amount of accumulated FGF1 in the cells and in the culture media at the later time points are identical in the late and early passage cells and that the early passage cells begin to accumulate significant amounts of FGF1 as they begin to undergo apoptosis. The amount of FGF2 produced and secreted by RPE cells was low (11 ± 1 ng/mg of total protein produced and < 0.1 ng/10 ml of culture medium secreted) (27Guillonneau X. Regnier-Ricard F. Dupuis C. Courtois Y. Mascarelli F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It did not vary significantly during the 7-day culture period and was unaffected by passage number (data not shown).Serum-deprivation Causes More Rapid FGFR1 Activation by Secreted FGF1 in Late RPE CellsCell survival may be controlled by the amount of receptor produced. We analyzed the de novo synthesis of FGFR1 (the only FGF tyrosine-kinase receptor at the bovine RPE cell surface) during serial passage and investigated its production during the 7-day culture period after serum withdrawal (Fig.2, A and B). Thede novo synthesis of FGFR1 was constant in both early and late passages during the culture period in the absence of serum, and there was no difference in the level of the de novosynthesis of FGFR1 during the subcultures (Fig. 2 A). In addition, FGFR1 production did not vary significantly during the 7-day culture period in early and late RPE cell passages and was unaffected by passage number (Fig. 2 B). Because autophosphorylation of FGFR plays a key role in the interactions between activated tyrosine-kinase receptors and downstream signal transduction pathways, we investigated the autophophorylation of FGFR1 in RPE cells during subcultures in the absence of serum (Fig. 2, C andD). FGFR1 in early passages (Fig. 2 C) underwent tyrosine phosphorylation to a lesser extent than in late passages (Fig.2 D). In addition, FGFR1 tyrosine autophosphorylation in early passage RPE cells was weak, did not change during the first three days of culture, and then increased to reach a plateau by the 4th day of culture (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, FGFR1 tyrosine autophosphorylation in late passage RPE cells was fairly constant throughout the culture period. Neutralization of secreted FGF1 in early and late passages resulted in reduction of FGFR1 activation to a constant basal level.Figure 2Effects of serum depletion in long-term culture on FGFR1 de novo synthesis, expression, and autophosphorylation in early and late RPE cell passages. RPE cells were cultured in serum-free conditions for 7 days as described for Fig.1. A, each day, 150 μCi/ml of [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine were added for 24 h. Subsequently, RPE cells were lysed on days 1, 3, and 5, and equal volumes containing 200 μg of protein of the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FGFR1 antibody and were analyzed by SDS-7% PAGE and autoradiography. M,14C-methylated molecular mass markers (200, 92, and 69 kDa). B, lysates from early and late passages were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FGFR1 antibody. Each day, early (C) and late (D) RPE cell passages had been incubated with 200 μCi/ml of Na332PO4. Equal volumes containing 200 μg of protein of cell lysates were incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B previously treated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. After elution of phosphotyrosine-containing protein with 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer, anti-FGFR1 antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose was added. After being washed, the adsorbed material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Time of exposure of autoradiograph was 3 days. These experiments were repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sustained Phosphorylation, Activity, and de Novo Synthesis of ERK2 over a 7-Day Culture Period after Serum Deprivation in Late Passage CellsExogenous FGF1 Causes a Sustained ERK2 Activation in Late Passage CellsWe found that there was a relationship between cell survival, FGF1 synthesis and secretion, and FGFR1 activation. This led us to explore the downstream pathways which may be involved in cell survival in late RPE cell passages. We began by investigating the activation of ERK2 by exogenous FGF1 during serial passage (Fig. 3). Activation of FGFR1 resulted in phosphorylation of ERK2 within 5 min, reaching a peak at 15 min in both early and late passages, (Fig. 3, A andB). In early and late passage cells, the first phase of activation was followed by a second sustained phase of activity lasting 12 h. ERK2 activity was determined by measuring phosphorylation of myelin basic protein as substrate (Fig. 3, C andD). As expected, there was a direct correlation between ERK2 phosphorylation and ERK2 activity in both early and late passages. No change in JNK1 expression was detected after FGF1 stimulation in either early or late passage cells (Fig. 3, E andF).Figure 3Effects of exogenous FGF1 on ERK2 phosphorylation and activity, and on JNK1 protein expression. After 48 h of serum deprivation (Time 0, lane 1), confluent RPE cells of early (A, C, andE) and late (B, D, and F) passages were treated for 5 min (lane 2), 15 min (lane 3), 30 min (lane 4), 2 h (lane 5), 4 h (lane 6), 8 h (lane 7), and 12 h (lane 8) with 10 ng/ml FGF1. Cells were lysed, and equivalent amounts of protein were reduced and subjected to SDS-PAGE and a Western blot performed using an anti-ERK2 antibody (Aand B). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-ERK2 antibody, and ERK2 activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” (C and D). Activation of JNK1 was measured by Western blot with anti-JNK1 antibody (E and F). These data are representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sustained Activation and de Novo Synthesis of ERK2 over the 7-Day Culture Period in Late Passage CellsAs exogenous FGF1 induced sustained, high level ERK2 activation in late passage cells, we investigated ERK2 phosphorylation and activity in both early and late RPE cell passages over the 7-day culture period in the absence of serum in which various kinetics and amounts of FGF1 excretion were observed (Fig. 4). There was only weak phosphorylation and activity of ERK2 during the 7-day culture period of cells in early passage (Fig. 4 A). Contrary to expectation, we found that the total amount of ERK2 was in late passage cells 4–5-fold higher than that in early passage cells (Fig. 4 A). Phosphorylation of ERK2 detected after 24 h was still detected after 7 days of culture, and ERK2 activity was also 4–6-fold higher than in early passage cells (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Effects of serum depletion in long-term cultures on ERK2 phosphorylation, ERK2 activity and de novosynthesis of ERK2 and JNK1. Early and late passage RPE cell cultures were incubated in serum-free conditions for 7 days as described in Fig. 1. Phosphorylation of ERK2 (A) and ERK2 activity (B) were measured as described in Fig. 3. For measurement of de novo synthesis of ERK2 (C) and of JNK1 (D), RPE cells were cultured in the absence of serum for 7 days and were given 150 μCi/ml of a mixture containing [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine daily. Samples of 150 μg of proteins were prepared daily with RIPA buffer, and ERK2 and JNK1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK2 and anti-JNK1 antibodies. C and D, time of exposure of autoradiograph was 2 days. Similar results were achieved in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protein synthesis was monitored using radiolabeled amino acids on each day of the 7 days of culture, to determine whether the increase in ERK2 during serial passage was because of its de novosynthesis, (Fig. 4 C). ERK2 synthesis was low in early passage cells and did not significantly change during the 7-day culture period. De novo synthesis of ERK2 was detected on day 1 of culture, at similar levels in early and late-passage cells. After 24 h in late passage RPE cells, de novo synthesis of ERK2 increased and was 3-fold higher on day 2 and 5-fold higher on day 5, whereas de novo synthesis of JNK1 was unaffected (Fig.4 D).ERK2 Synthesis and Activation Is Required for RPE Cell SurvivalIn a control experiment, 10 μm PD098059 completely inhibited activation of ERK2 in RPE cells by exogenous FGF1 (data not shown). Inhibition of MEK 1 activity resulted in inhibition of ERK2 synthesis and phosphorylation (Figs.5, A and B). ERK2 synthesis was 7-fold lower than the basal levels in early and late passage cells on day 5, and its activation was completely inhibited in early passage cells and 5-fold lower than basal levels in late passage cells. A single dose of PD098059 led to a rapid 8-fold increase in apoptosis after only 24 h of culture in both early and late cell passages (Fig. 5, C and D). On day 7, cell survival in the presence of the MEK 1 inhibitor was 2-fold lower in early passage cells and 4-fold lower in late passage cells on day 7. There were no nonspecific cytotoxic effects of PD098059 because we detected no significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in either early or late passages in the presence of serum (Fig. 5,C and D). Furthermore, 10 μmPD098059 did not inhibit total protein synthesis (data not shown).Figure 5Effects of MEK1 inhibition on de novoERK2 synthesis, ERK2 phosphorylation, and on programmed cell death in early and late RPE cell passages. RPE cell subcultures were incubated in serum-free conditions, in the presence or the absence of the MEK1 inhibitor (Inh), PD098059 added on day 1 of the culture at a concentration of 10 μm. De novoERK2 synthesis (A) and ERK2 phosphorylation (B) were analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 similarly as described in Fig. 3. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. C and D, PCD was measured on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Differences between means were analyzed using the Mann and Whitney test.

Neutralization of secreted FGF1 resulted in inhibition of ERK2 phosphorylation after 3 days of culture in both early and late passage cells (Fig. 6 A). It also reduced de novo synthesis of ERK2 by 70% after 5 days of culture in both early and late passage cells (data not shown).Figure 6Effects of FGF1 neutralization on ERK2 phosphorylation and of FGFR1 blocking on programmed cell death andde novo ERK2 synthesis of early and late RPE cell passages. RPE cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 7 days in the presence or absence of neutralizing anti-FGF1 antibody (Ab) at 200 μg/ml (A) and blocking anti-FGFR1 antibody at 100 nm (B, C, andD). PCD (B) was detected and quantified as described in Fig. 1, and ERK2 phosphorylation (B) andde novo synthesis (C and D) were analyzed as described in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Similar results were obtained for three independent experiments. B, values are means ± S.D. and differences between means were analyzed by the Mann and Whitney test. *, p < 0.05; **,p < 0.005. C, exposure time of autoradiogram was 5 days; D, exposure time 36 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We added a blocking anti-FGFR1 antibody to the culture medium to check that the effects of secreted FGF1 on activation of the MAP kinase pathway and on reduction of RPE cell apoptosis were mediated by an autocrine/paracrine stimulation of the tyrosine-kinase receptor FGFR1. We analyzed the effects of FGFR1 blocking on PCD of RPE cells by the TUNEL method (Fig. 6 B). Inactivation of FGFR1 had no significant effect during the first 3 days of culture. On day 5, the number of TUNEL-labeled nuclei doubled in early passage cells and increased by a factor of 12 in late passage cells in the presence of neutralizing antibody. On day 7, TUNEL labeling of cells in both early and late passages indicated levels of PCD similar to those obtained in the presence of the MEK 1 inhibitor (Figs. 5, C andD, and 6 B). Inhibition of the binding of secreted FGF1 to FGFR1 in early RPE cell passages resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the de novo synthesis of ERK2 after 3 days of culture (Fig. 6 C). In late RPE cell passages, the blocking anti-FGFR1 antibody reduced de novo synthesis of ERK2 by a factor of 3 after 5 days and by a factor of 8 after 7 days (Fig.6 D). Neutralizing anti-FGF1 and blocking anti-FGFR1 antibodies did not affect PCD in RPE cells cultured in the presence of serum and did not significantly alter total protein synthesis (data not shown). This shows there was no nonspecific cytotoxic effect of the antibodies. These results support the notion that the activation of FGFR1 by secreted FGF1 and the subsequent activation and synthesis of ERK2 were required for secreted FGF1 to increase the survival of RPE cells.

Synchronously growing worms were prepared using the alkaline hypochlorite method (26Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Caenorhabditis elegans Modern Biological Analysis of an Organism. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, California1995: 3-29Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from C. elegans of mixed growth stages using TriZOLTM LS Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. 15 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were carried out using probes labeled by the random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and QuikHyb solution (Stratagene) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The blot was also hybridized with a probe from the ribosomal protein generp21 as a loading control (27Spieth J. Shim Y.H. Lea K. Conrad R. Blumenthal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4651-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The filter was scanned by the Image-Analyzer BAS-1000 (Fuji Film) for semi-quantitative estimation of transcript levels. Genomic DNA was prepared from a mixed population of worms and subjected to Southern blot analysis. For low stringency conditions, the filters were washed at room temperature for 10 min with 5× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, followed by a further wash at 60 °C for 10 min (27Spieth J. Shim Y.H. Lea K. Conrad R. Blumenthal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4651-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The upstream region of vha-3 was amplified directly from C. elegansgenomic DNA by PCR using primers (5′-gcgacaggtactgcaggatattg-3′ and 5′-gcggtttccaagtcgtcgacattt-3′). The maximum amount of upstream region was used but without introducing the regulatory regions of neighboring genes. The 2.2-kb product was digested with PstI andSalI and inserted into pPD89.03, a lacZ reporter plasmid, to create pCV3–03. pCV02 was constructed by inserting the 1.3-kb BamHI to SalI fragment, which contained the regulatory region of vha-1 and vha-2 (18Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), into pPD89.03. Transgenic worms were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (28Fire A. Harrison W. Dixon D. Gene. 1990; 93: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Identification of cell types has been previously described using Nomarski optics (18Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol.

Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was introduced into the yeast Δvma5mutant SF838–1D (MATα leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his4–519 ade6 gal2 pep4–3 Δvma5::LEU2, Ref. 20Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were streaked on YPD plates (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, and 2% glucose), including either 50 mm sodium succinate, pH 5.0, or 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days to score the growth phenotype. Previously, we identified two proteolipid genes,vha-1 and vha-2, in C. elegans which had 60% amino acid identity (18Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We searched for additional genes using RT-PCR. One PCR product was highly similar to thevha-2 gene, and analysis of the C. elegans genome data base indicated that the PCR product matched the Y38F2 YAC genomic clone from chromosome IV. We named the corresponding genevha-3 and searched the EST data base for a full-length clone. We found only one clone (yk413h1) that contained a part of the sequence of the PCR product. A full-length clone of vha-3 was obtained by RT-PCR using primers specific for vha-3 and the spliced leaders that are attached to the 5′ end of almost all processed transcripts in C. elegans (31Zorio D.A.R. Cheng N.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Nature. 1994; 372: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The entire vha-3 cDNA was 1421 bp (not including polyadenylation) with an open reading frame of 486 bp. The coding region of vha-3 was 85% identical to that ofvha-2 (Fig. 1 A), whereas the 3′-untranslational region (935 bp) of vha-3 was 461 bp longer and had no similarity with that of vha-2. vha-3 encoded a 161-amino acid polypeptide completely identical to the VHA-2 protein. 38% of vha-3 codons had silent substitutions when compared with vha-2 (Fig. 1 A): almost all changes (90%) were the wobble position. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences revealed that vha-3 is an intron-less gene (Fig. 1 B), whereas vha-2 has two introns (18Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison with the Y38F2 YAC genomic clone revealed that clone yk434g8 mapped immediate downstream ofvha-3. An open reading frame was found in yk434g8 that shared high sequence identity with the V-ATPase C subunits of other species. We named the gene vha-11 and obtained the entire vha-11 cDNA by RT-PCR. Comparison with genomic DNA and cDNA sequences indicated that the vha-11 gene consisted of seven exons (Fig. 1 A). The 1639-bp cDNA contained a coding region for a 384-amino acid polypeptide without any putative transmembrane regions. The VHA-11 protein exhibits 37%, 56%, and 56% sequence identity with the C subunits of yeast (Vma5p) (20Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Beltran C. Kopecky J. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 774-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine (22Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Noumi T. Moriyama Y. Miedel M.C. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20390-20393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and human (23van Hille B. Vanek M. Richener H. Green J.R. Bilbe G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig.2 A). To address whether the VHA-11 protein is the V-ATPase Csubunit, the vha-11 cDNA was placed under control of the yeast TDH3 constitutive promoter. The resulting plasmid was introduced into a yeast vma5 null mutant that grows very slowly at neutral pH (20Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of vha-11 completely restored growth of the vma5 mutant (Fig. 2 B), thus demonstrating that the VHA-11 protein can substitute as aC subunit in yeast. To confirm that vha-3 and vha-11 genes are expressed, Northern blot analysis was performed using RNA from a mixed-stage culture. The vha-3 probe hybridized with three transcripts (0.9, 1.0, and 1.4 kb; see Fig.3 A). The 1.4-kb transcript corresponded to vha-3 because it was consistent with the length of the cDNA. Two weaker bands (0.9 and 1.0 kb) showed the same mobility as vha-2 transcripts and are likely because of cross-hybridization. The amount of the vha-3 transcript was roughly five percent of vha-1 or vha-2. A single band (1.5 kb) was detected for the vha-11 transcript whose size was compatible with that of the cDNA (Fig. 3 B). Sequence comparison of genomic and cDNA clones showed that only five base pairs were present between vha-3 andvha-11 (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that they constitute a polycistronic unit similar to vha-1 and vha-2. To confirm whether vha-3 and vha-11 are in a single gene cluster and whether their transcripts aretrans-spliced, RT-PCR analysis was carried out using primers specific for the spliced leaders (SL1 and SL2). The vha-3mRNA exclusively received SL1, and vha-11 wastrans-spliced with SL1 or SL2, suggesting that the two genes are transcribed as a polycistronic unit and thant vha-3 is located immediate downstream of the promoter. To search for other C. elegans proteolipid genes, Southern blot analysis was carried out under low stringency conditions. Thevha-1 probe hybridized with single bands, the sizes of which were consistent with the length predicted from the genomic sequence (Fig. 4). No other bands were detected even under low stringency conditions, thus indicating thatvha-1 is a single gene and no other homologue exists in this organism. In the case of vha-2 and vha-3, two bands were always observed when genomic DNA was treated with different enzymes. As shown for vha-3 in Fig. 4, the strong signals representedvha-3, and the weak bands were because of cross-hybridization with vha-2. Similar hybridization patterns were observed with vha-2. These results strongly suggest that no additional vha-2 or vha-3homologues are present. vha-4, encoding the 23-kDa V-ATPase proteolipid (18Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was also in single copy in the worm genome. Taken together, these results indicate that only four vhaproteolipid genes are present in C. elegans. The obvious but interesting question is what distinguishesvha-2 and vha-3 since they code for the identical protein. We first assessed the expression of each gene as a function of life cycle. Northern blot analysis was carried out using RNA from different developmental stages. All four proteolipid genes were highly expressed in the embryo and much lower during larval stages (Fig.5). The results suggest that the V-ATPase activities may be important during embryogenesis and cell proliferation (32Davies S.A. Goodwin S.F. Kelly D.C. Wang Z. Sözen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30677-30684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The expression of all genes gradually increased again leading up to the adult stage. When in the dauer stage, an obligate stage of diapause, all four transcripts were present but at approximately 2-fold higher levels than the L2 or L3 stage as judged from quantitation of the blot scans. No significant differences were observed on the expression patterns between vha-2 and vha-3 through all stages. We note that the vha-2 gene was expressed at higher levels thanvha-1 in the embryo, L1, and L4 stages (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the amount of vha-1 and vha-2transcripts were similar at other stages. This observation points out that transcription of the two genes, even though in a polycistronic unit, may be differentially regulated at least during the larval stages by an unknown mechanism. Although V-ATPase genes are ubiquitously expressed,vha-1, vha-2, and vha-4 were expressed at much higher levels in the H-shaped excretory cell (18Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine the expression pattern of the vha-3 gene, a fusion gene was constructed by inserting a genomic fragment containing thevha-3 5′ transcriptional regulatory sequences through to the first two codons of the reading frame into a lacZ expression vector (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, expression of thevha-3 fusion gene was significantly different in the adult worm from the other 16-kDa proteolipid genes. vha-1 andvha-2 were predominantly expressed in the H-shaped excretory cell and rectum (Fig. 6 C), which confirmed previous results obtained with GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion genes (18Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, vha-3 was mainly expressed in gastrointestinal and hypodermal cells, in addition to the H-shaped excretory cell (Fig. 6, A and B). After prolonged staining, the canals of the H-shaped excretory cell also became visible (arrowheads). Similar results were obtained in transgenic worms carrying the reporter gene fused to the 5′ upstream region of vha-11 (data not shown), supporting thatvha-3 and vha-11 are transcribed as a polycistronic unit. These results demonstrate that the transcriptional regulation of vha-3 is different from that forvha-1 and vha-2. We have identified two genes (vha-3 andvha-11) coding for V-ATPase subunits of C. elegans. The 1421-bp vha-3 cDNA encodes the 16-kDa proteolipid. This is the fourth gene coding for isoforms of the proteolipid. vha-11 consists of seven exons and codes for a 384-amino acid hydrophilic polypeptide. The VHA-11 protein exhibited significant similarities to the V1 sector Csubunits of yeast (20Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Beltran C. Kopecky J. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 774-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine (22Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Noumi T. Moriyama Y. Miedel M.C. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20390-20393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and human (23van Hille B. Vanek M. Richener H. Green J.R. Bilbe G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and thevha-11 cDNA complemented a yeast vma5(C subunit) mutation, thus indicating that vha-11is a functional counterpart of VMA5. The vha-3 and vha-11 genes are tandemly located on chromosome IV as a single polycistronic unit. Transgenic analysis showed that vha-3 was most strongly expressed in intestine, hypodermis, and the H-shaped excretory cell (Fig. 6). Parallel expression patterns of a reporter gene fused to the 5′ upstream region of vha-11 support that vha-3 andvha-11 are transcribed as a polycistronic unit. As shown previously, vha-1 and vha-2, which are two other genes that code for the 16-kDa proteolipid, are also transcribed as a unit (18Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the first gene of both units (vha-1and vha-3) were found to have unusually long 3′-untranslated regions and no introns. In contrast to thevha-1/vha-2 unit, thevha-3/vha-11 consists of genes for one V0 and one peripheral V1 subunit. Genes for other V-ATPase subunits, B, D, E,F, G, H, a and d, have been identified from the C. elegans genome project data base (ACeDB WS2 4–16) based on sequence similarities to known yeast subunits (13Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar); however, none of these are in a polycistronic unit. Thus the transcriptional units of vha-3/vha-11 andvha-1/vha-2 are unique among V-ATPase genes inC. elegans. Finally, we note thatvha-3/vha-11 andvha-1/vha-2 gene pairs are functionally related. Most C. elegans gene clusters consist of unrelated genes, although lin-15A/lin-15B andfib-1/rps-16 pairs are clearly functionally related (31Zorio D.A.R. Cheng N.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Nature. 1994; 372: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 33Spieth J. Brooke G. Kuersten S. Lea K. Blumenthal T. Cell. 1993; 73: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of the C. elegans genome showed that additional homologues of the proteolipid genes are not present, therefore suggesting that only four proteolipid genes (vha-1, vha-2, and vha-3, 16-kDa subunit; vha-4, 23 kDa) are present. This is the first report of four proteolipid genes in the same genome. Among these genes,vha-3 and vha-2 share very high nucleotide similarity within the coding region and encode identical polypeptides. Although 38% of the codons used for vha-3 andvha-2 are different, the codon usage is not significantly different from other C. elegans open reading frames (34Krause M. Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Caenorhabditis elegans Modern Biological Analysis of an Organism. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, California1995: 482-512Google Scholar). Two cDNAs for very similar proteolipids (16 kDa) were also isolated from cotton and shared 95% identity within the coding region (35Hasenfrate M.-P. Tsou C.-L. Wilkins T.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The functions of the two similar genes now found in plants and animals remains to be understood. We should note our attempts to isolate the knock-out mutants of vha-2 and vha-3 by the target-selected mutagenesis using transposon Tc1 (36Zwaal R.R. Broeks A. van Meurs J. Groenen J.T.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7431-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This procedure is known to delete more than a few kilobase pairs of DNA from the Tc1 target site. As expected, the null mutations were accompanied by large deletions of flanking genes. It is very difficult to isolate the desired knock-out mutants, possibly because the lengths of the twovha coding regions are less than 600 bp. We might presume that vha-2 and vha-3 are transcribed differently during the worm life cycle or have different transcriptional regulation in a cell-specific manner; however, Northern analysis of worms at each developmental stage indicated thatvha-2 and vha-3 are transcribed similarly. Instead, we assessed the transcription of vha-2 andvha-3 in different cell types. Analysis of adult worms carrying the lacZ gene under control of the vha-3regulatory sequence indicated that vha-3 was strongly expressed in the gastrointestinal and hypodermal cells, as well as the H-shaped excretory cell. Similar results were obtained using the GFP reporter plasmid. In contrast, vha-2 was highly expressed in the H-shaped excretory cell and rectum (Fig. 6 C and Ref. 18Oka T. Yamamoto R. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24387-24392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and was not detected in gastrointestinal and hypodermal cells even after prolonged staining. These results strongly suggest that expression of the two vha genes are differentially regulated according to cell type. From the above results, we suggest there is a subunit isoform difference in the V0 sectors in different cell types. Similarly, cell-specific expression of mammalian V1subunits is also known. There are brain and kidney forms of theB subunit that have been identified in human and bovine. These B subunits share 84% amino acid identity (37Nelson D. Guo X.-L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3696-3706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that different isoforms define functional differences of the V-ATPases is under investigation.

https://openalex.org/W1972222847,"In a previous study, site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified three of the four ligands to the [2Fe-2S] cluster in animal ferrochelatase as conserved cysteines in the COOH-terminal extension, Cys-403, Cys-406, and Cys-411 in human ferrochelatase (Crouse, B. R., Sellers, V. M., Finnegan, M. G., Dailey, H. A. & Johnson, M. K. (1996)Biochemistry 35, 16222–16229). The nature of the fourth ligand was left unresolved, and spectroscopic studies raised the possibility of one noncysteinyl, oxygenic ligand. In this work, we report two lines of evidence that strongly suggest the fourth ligand is a cysteine residue. Cysteine at position 196 in human recombinant ferrochelatase when changed to a serine results in an inactive enzyme that is lacking the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Furthermore, whole cell EPR studies demonstrate that in the C196S mutant the cluster fails to assemble. Additionally, the cloning and expression of Drosophila melanogaster ferrochelatase has allowed the identification, by EPR and UV-visible spectroscopy, of a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster with properties analogous to those of animal ferrochelatases. The observation that Drosophila ferrochelatase contains only four conserved cysteines at positions 196, 403, 406, and 411, is in accord with the proposal that these residues function as cluster ligands. In the case of the ferrochelatase iron-sulfur cluster ligands, NH2—Cys-X206-Cys-X2-Cys-X4-Cys—COOH, the position distant from other ligands may lead to a spatial positioning of the cluster near the enzyme active site or at the interface of two domains, thereby explaining the loss of enzyme activity that accompanies cluster degradation and reinforcing the idea that the cluster functions as a regulatory switch. In a previous study, site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified three of the four ligands to the [2Fe-2S] cluster in animal ferrochelatase as conserved cysteines in the COOH-terminal extension, Cys-403, Cys-406, and Cys-411 in human ferrochelatase (Crouse, B.

The terminal enzyme in heme biosynthesis, ferrochelatase (E.C. 4.99.1.1), catalyzes the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin IX. Nuclear-encoded and produced in the cytoplasm, ferrochelatase is proteolytically processed upon translocation into the mitochondrion. In eukaryotes, the mature-length 42,000 Da protein is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, with the active site facing the mitochondrial matrix (1Dailey H.A. Hausinger R.P. Eichorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Mechanisms of Metallocenter Assembly. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 77-98Google Scholar). The proposed catalytic mechanism (2Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 411-417Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) initially involves a metal-dependent, enzyme-mediated distortion of the bound porphyrin ring allowing rapid insertion of Fe2+ into the bent porphyrin (3Blackwood M.E. Rush T. Medlock A.E. Dailey H.A. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12170-12174Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Distinct from the enzyme's catalytic activity, a labile [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster has been identified in several animal ferrochelatases including human (4Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), mouse (5Ferreira G.C. Franco R. Lloyd S.G. Pereira A.S. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7062-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chicken, and frog (6Day A.L. Parsons B.H. Dailey H.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although similar to the [2Fe-2S]2+ centers found in plant ferredoxins, the ferrochelatase iron-sulfur cluster is more labile with enhanced sensitivity to degradation by nitric oxide (7Sellers V.M. Johnson M.K. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). That the cluster plays no direct role part in catalysis is evidenced by the observation that bacterial, plant, and yeast ferrochelatases do not contain the metal center, and by studies showing that the redox state of the cluster is inconsequential to enzyme activity (4Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, when the cluster is disassembled, enzyme activity is lost (4Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Sellers V.M. Johnson M.K. Dailey H.A.

Hence the cluster appears to play a crucial role in maintaining protein structure in animal ferrochelatases and coupled with the sensitivity to nitric oxide, this has lead us to postulate that the cluster may serve as a regulatory NO 1The abbreviations used are: NOnitric oxideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: NOnitric oxideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.-sensor as part of an immune response (7Sellers V.M.

Additionally, at this time it was proposed that certain spectroscopic anomalies and the unusual lability of the cluster may result from one noncysteinyl oxygenic ligand. The objective of the present investigation was to identify the fourth cluster ligand via additional mutagenesis experiments and by cloning, expression, and characterization of cluster-containing ferrochelatases from more distantly related organisms. We report here the first characterization of ferrochelatase from Drosophila melanogaster and, together with the new mutagenesis results with the human enzyme, these new data support the assignment of the cysteine located at position 196 in the human ferrochelatase as the fourth cluster ligand. Tracing the biological evolution of the iron-sulfur cluster in ferrochelatase also provides further insight concerning the specific role of this metal center.DISCUSSIONPreviously we have presented data supporting a role for Cys-403, Cys-406, and Cys-411 as ligands for the [2Fe-2S]2+cluster of animal ferrochelatase (8Crouse B.R. Sellers V.M. Finnegan M.G. Dailey H.A. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16222-16229Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, anomalous spectral data were intrepreted as possible support for involvement of an oxygen as the fourth cluster ligand. In the current work Drosophilaferrochelatase has been cloned, sequenced, expressed, and the isolated protein characterized. It was shown to contain a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster with properties analogous to those found in animal ferrochelatases. The observation that only four cysteines are conserved between Drosophila and animal ferrochelatases, coupled with the mutagenesis results presented herein and in our previous mutagenesis studies (8Crouse B.R. Sellers V.M. Finnegan M.G. Dailey H.A. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16222-16229Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) provides strong evidence that Cys-196, Cys-403, Cys-406, and Cys-411 ligate the cluster in human ferrochelatase. In addition results from site-directed mutagenesis experiments described above demonstrate that the potential oxygen ligands of Ser-387, Ser-396, Ser-402, Ser-416, and Ser-420 are not ligands. Unpublished data from this laboratory also rule out Asp-340, Glu-343, Glu-347, Tyr-123, Tyr-165, Tyr-191, and Tyr-276 because alteration of these residues does not alter the cluster, although some have a significant impact on enzyme kinetics. Data from others suggest that Ser-102 and Ser-174 (19Gora M. Grzybowska E. Rytka J. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11810-11816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) along with His-157, His-263, His-341, and His-388 (20Kohno H. Okuda M. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) would probably not be involved in cluster ligation. Examination of the available ferrochelatase sequences show that Cys-196 is found only in animal and two bacterial ferrochelatases, and this position is occupied by serine in three bacterial enzymes, thus arguing against a general disruption of protein structure by the C196S alteration as an explanation for cluster loss. Inspection of the crystal structure for Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase (21Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Nikonov S. Jonsson B. Hederstedt L. Structure ( Lond. ). 1997; 5: 1501-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the only known enzyme structure but one that lacks a cluster, shows that serine residues at positions 195, 261, and 303 participate in internal H-bonding and that most residues other than the ones listed above appear to be too distant spatially for the carboxyl-terminal end to reach.Based upon these observations we propose that all available data are consistent with a model where the [2Fe-2S] cluster in ferrochelatase is ligated by a group of three closely spaced cysteines near the COOH terminus and one remote cysteine in a NH2—Cys-X206-Cys-X2-Cys-X4-Cys—COOH arrangement. Although this overall pattern of coordinating cysteines is similar to that found in simple [2Fe-2S]-containing ferredoxins,e.g.NH2—Cys-X4-Cys-X2-Cys-X29-Cys—COOH in chloroplast ferredoxins and NH2—Cys-X5-Cys-X2-Cys-X36/37-Cys—COOH in hydroxylase-type ferredoxins (22Matsubara H.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 1896-1915Google Scholar), the spacing to the remote cysteine is larger, and the remote cysteine is located closest to the NH2 terminus in ferrochelatase. Because loss of enzyme activity accompanies cluster degradation, it is tempting to speculate that the remote cysteine ligand positions the cluster near the enzyme active site or at the interface of two domains. Such a structural arrangement is consistent with a regulatory role for the cluster.The key role of Fe-S clusters in determining protein structure makes them important regulatory targets for controlling enzyme activity or gene expression in response to external stimuli such as intracellular Fe, NO, O2 of O2− concentrations. Regulatory control can be accomplished via cluster degradation/reassembly (e.g. the [4Fe-4S] clusters in the mammalian iron-regulatory protein-1 (24Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5082-5086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)). Our current working hypothesis for ferrochelatase is that NO-induced degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster is part of a local immune response that prevents bacteria from using heme synthesized by the host organism (7Sellers V.M. Johnson M.K. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and that the requirement for iron to assemble the cluster in ferrochelatase may, in itself, present an additional iron regulatory step in heme biosynthesis during erythropoiesis.The arrangement of cluster ligands in ferrochelatase also explains the absence of the cluster in several exon deletion mutants. A genetic defect in human ferrochelatase causes the disease erythropoietic protoporhyria. Exon deletions are common causes of this disease (32Sarkany R.P.E. Alexander G.J.M. Cox T.M. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1394-1396Abstract PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Nakahashi Y. Fujita H. Taketani S. Ishida N. Kappas A. Sassa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1993; 91: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A set of mutants containing individual deletions of exons 3 through 11 was previously constructed to study the underlying biochemical nature of erythropoietic protoporhyria (37Sellers V.M. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These exon deletion mutants possessed no enzyme activity, and in each case the Fe-S cluster failed to assemble. With cluster ligands spanning the mature-length protein, the excision of entire exons must affect the ability of the protein to properly assume its native conformation with an intact iron-sulfur cluster. If the cluster itself is responsible for maintaining the protein structure, failure to generate the cluster may result in a protein that never reaches its proper conformation. Distant spacing of cluster ligands may be crucial for regulation of global as opposed to local structure.The identification of complete cysteinyl coordination for the ferrochelatase Fe-S cluster also has important consequences for the interpretation of resonance Raman and variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism spectra of [2Fe-2S] centers. On the basis of spectral comparisons with mutant ferredoxins with one noncysteinyl ligand, it was argued that the Fe-S stretching frequencies of the oxidized [2Fe-2S]2+ center and the pattern of S → Fe(III) charge transfer bands in the variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism spectrum of the reduced [2Fe-2S]+center could be interpreted in terms of one oxygenic ligand at the nonreducible Fe site of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in human ferrochelatase (8Crouse B.R. Sellers V.M. Finnegan M.G. Dailey H.A. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16222-16229Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It now seems likely that the overall simplification of the S → Fe(III) charge transfer region in the variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism spectrum of reduced human ferrochelatase is a consequence of heterogeneity resulting in poor spectral resolution, rather than partial noncysteinyl ligation, and that there is greater overlap in the ranges of ligand-sensitive Fe-S stretching modes than previously established. For example, with the inclusion of ferrochelatase as a cluster with complete cysteinyl coordination, the lowest energy Fe-S stretching mode, which involves out-of-phase combination of the symmetric Fe-S(Cys) stretching, has now been observed in the range 281–295 cm−1 for [2Fe-2S]+ clusters with complete cysteinyl coordination and in the range 289–302 cm−1 for [2Fe-2S]+clusters with one oxygenic ligand. The present study serves to demonstrate that although these techniques are useful in suggesting the possibility of anomalous cluster coordination, they clearly require confirmation in the form of structural or mutagenesis evidence. The terminal enzyme in heme biosynthesis, ferrochelatase (E.C. 4.99.1.1), catalyzes the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin IX. Nuclear-encoded and produced in the cytoplasm, ferrochelatase is proteolytically processed upon translocation into the mitochondrion. In eukaryotes, the mature-length 42,000 Da protein is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, with the active site facing the mitochondrial matrix (1Dailey H.A. Hausinger R.P. Eichorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Mechanisms of Metallocenter Assembly. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 77-98Google Scholar). The proposed catalytic mechanism (2Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 411-417Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) initially involves a metal-dependent, enzyme-mediated distortion of the bound porphyrin ring allowing rapid insertion of Fe2+ into the bent porphyrin (3Blackwood M.E. Rush T. Medlock A.E. Dailey H.A. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12170-12174Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Distinct from the enzyme's catalytic activity, a labile [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster has been identified in several animal ferrochelatases including human (4Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), mouse (5Ferreira G.C. Franco R. Lloyd S.G. Pereira A.S. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Huynh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7062-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chicken, and frog (6Day A.L. Parsons B.H. Dailey H.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although similar to the [2Fe-2S]2+ centers found in plant ferredoxins, the ferrochelatase iron-sulfur cluster is more labile with enhanced sensitivity to degradation by nitric oxide (7Sellers V.M. Johnson M.K. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). That the cluster plays no direct role part in catalysis is evidenced by the observation that bacterial, plant, and yeast ferrochelatases do not contain the metal center, and by studies showing that the redox state of the cluster is inconsequential to enzyme activity (4Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, when the cluster is disassembled, enzyme activity is lost (4Dailey H.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Sellers V.M. Johnson M.K. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and the protein readily precipitates. Hence the cluster appears to play a crucial role in maintaining protein structure in animal ferrochelatases and coupled with the sensitivity to nitric oxide, this has lead us to postulate that the cluster may serve as a regulatory NO 1The abbreviations used are: NOnitric oxideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: NOnitric oxideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.-sensor as part of an immune response (7Sellers V.M.

Unpublished data from this laboratory also rule out Asp-340, Glu-343, Glu-347, Tyr-123, Tyr-165, Tyr-191, and Tyr-276 because alteration of these residues does not alter the cluster, although some have a significant impact on enzyme kinetics. Data from others suggest that Ser-102 and Ser-174 (19Gora M. Grzybowska E. Rytka J. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11810-11816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) along with His-157, His-263, His-341, and His-388 (20Kohno H. Okuda M. Furukawa T. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) would probably not be involved in cluster ligation. Examination of the available ferrochelatase sequences show that Cys-196 is found only in animal and two bacterial ferrochelatases, and this position is occupied by serine in three bacterial enzymes, thus arguing against a general disruption of protein structure by the C196S alteration as an explanation for cluster loss. Inspection of the crystal structure for Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase (21Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Nikonov S. Jonsson B. Hederstedt L. Structure ( Lond. ). 1997; 5: 1501-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the only known enzyme structure but one that lacks a cluster, shows that serine residues at positions 195, 261, and 303 participate in internal H-bonding and that most residues other than the ones listed above appear to be too distant spatially for the carboxyl-terminal end to reach. Based upon these observations we propose that all available data are consistent with a model where the [2Fe-2S] cluster in ferrochelatase is ligated by a group of three closely spaced cysteines near the COOH terminus and one remote cysteine in a NH2—Cys-X206-Cys-X2-Cys-X4-Cys—COOH arrangement. Although this overall pattern of coordinating cysteines is similar to that found in simple [2Fe-2S]-containing ferredoxins,e.g.NH2—Cys-X4-Cys-X2-Cys-X29-Cys—COOH in chloroplast ferredoxins and NH2—Cys-X5-Cys-X2-Cys-X36/37-Cys—COOH in hydroxylase-type ferredoxins (22Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Johnson M.K. King R.B. Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 1896-1915Google Scholar), the spacing to the remote cysteine is larger, and the remote cysteine is located closest to the NH2 terminus in ferrochelatase. Because loss of enzyme activity accompanies cluster degradation, it is tempting to speculate that the remote cysteine ligand positions the cluster near the enzyme active site or at the interface of two domains. Such a structural arrangement is consistent with a regulatory role for the cluster. The key role of Fe-S clusters in determining protein structure makes them important regulatory targets for controlling enzyme activity or gene expression in response to external stimuli such as intracellular Fe, NO, O2 of O2− concentrations. Regulatory control can be accomplished via cluster degradation/reassembly (e.g. the [4Fe-4S] clusters in the mammalian iron-regulatory protein-1 (24Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5082-5086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)). Our current working hypothesis for ferrochelatase is that NO-induced degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster is part of a local immune response that prevents bacteria from using heme synthesized by the host organism (7Sellers V.M. Johnson M.K. Dailey H.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and that the requirement for iron to assemble the cluster in ferrochelatase may, in itself, present an additional iron regulatory step in heme biosynthesis during erythropoiesis. The arrangement of cluster ligands in ferrochelatase also explains the absence of the cluster in several exon deletion mutants. A genetic defect in human ferrochelatase causes the disease erythropoietic protoporhyria. Exon deletions are common causes of this disease (32Sarkany R.P.E. Alexander G.J.M. Cox T.M. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1394-1396Abstract PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Nakahashi Y. Fujita H. Taketani S. Ishida N. Kappas A. Sassa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1993; 91: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A set of mutants containing individual deletions of exons 3 through 11 was previously constructed to study the underlying biochemical nature of erythropoietic protoporhyria (37Sellers V.M. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These exon deletion mutants possessed no enzyme activity, and in each case the Fe-S cluster failed to assemble. With cluster ligands spanning the mature-length protein, the excision of entire exons must affect the ability of the protein to properly assume its native conformation with an intact iron-sulfur cluster. If the cluster itself is responsible for maintaining the protein structure, failure to generate the cluster may result in a protein that never reaches its proper conformation. Distant spacing of cluster ligands may be crucial for regulation of global as opposed to local structure. The identification of complete cysteinyl coordination for the ferrochelatase Fe-S cluster also has important consequences for the interpretation of resonance Raman and variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism spectra of [2Fe-2S] centers. On the basis of spectral comparisons with mutant ferredoxins with one noncysteinyl ligand, it was argued that the Fe-S stretching frequencies of the oxidized [2Fe-2S]2+ center and the pattern of S → Fe(III) charge transfer bands in the variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism spectrum of the reduced [2Fe-2S]+center could be interpreted in terms of one oxygenic ligand at the nonreducible Fe site of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in human ferrochelatase (8Crouse B.R. Sellers V.M. Finnegan M.G. Dailey H.A. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16222-16229Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It now seems likely that the overall simplification of the S → Fe(III) charge transfer region in the variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism spectrum of reduced human ferrochelatase is a consequence of heterogeneity resulting in poor spectral resolution, rather than partial noncysteinyl ligation, and that there is greater overlap in the ranges of ligand-sensitive Fe-S stretching modes than previously established. For example, with the inclusion of ferrochelatase as a cluster with complete cysteinyl coordination, the lowest energy Fe-S stretching mode, which involves out-of-phase combination of the symmetric Fe-S(Cys) stretching, has now been observed in the range 281–295 cm−1 for [2Fe-2S]+ clusters with complete cysteinyl coordination and in the range 289–302 cm−1 for [2Fe-2S]+clusters with one oxygenic ligand. The present study serves to demonstrate that although these techniques are useful in suggesting the possibility of anomalous cluster coordination, they clearly require confirmation in the form of structural or mutagenesis evidence."

We have previously shown that yeast TFIIS (yTFIIS) comprises three structural domains (I-III). The three-dimensional structures of domain II and part of domain III have been previously reported, but neither domain can autonomously stimulate transcription elongation. Here we report the NMR structural analysis of residues 131–309 of yTFIIS which retains full activity and contains all of domains II and III. We confirm that the structure of domain II in the context of fully active yTFIIS is the same as that determined previously for a shorter construct. We have determined the structure of the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain of active yTFIIS and shown that it is similar to that reported for a shorter construct of human TFIIS.

NMR analysis of inactive mutants of yTFIIS support a role for the linker region in interactions with the transcription elongation complex. The rate of transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II is regulated by elongation factors, of which there are two classes with different mechanisms of action. One class, which includes elongin, ELL, pTEFb, and RAP74 stimulates the rate of nucleotide incorporation. The other class, includes TFIIS, its viral and archael sequence homologues, and the bacterial proteins, greA and greB. These proteins do not affect the rate of nucleotide incorporation, but rather stimulate an activity in RNA polymerase II that enables it to transcribe throught blocks to elongation such as DNA-binding proteins, DNA-binding drugs, or particular sequences of DNA that promote transcription arrest (1Reines D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanism and Regulation. 3. Raven Press, New York1994: 263-278Google Scholar).Although TFIIS 1The abbreviations used are: TFIIStranscription elongation factor IISPCRpolymerase chain reactionNOEnuclear Overhauser effect.1The abbreviations used are: TFIIStranscription elongation factor IISPCRpolymerase chain reactionNOEnuclear Overhauser effect.and its bacterial homologues have very similar mechanisms of action, their primary sequences and three-dimensional structures are quite different. GreA and greB each comprise 160 amino acids that form two 80-residue structural domains. In greA, the N-terminal domain is composed of two extended, coiled antiparallel α-helices, and can be cross-linked to the nascent RNA when bound to RNA polymerase in a stalled elongation complex (2Stebbins C.E. Borukhov S. Orlova M. Polyakov A. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of greA is globular and is composed of a β-sheet that cradles an α-helix. GreB is a sequence homologue of greA and likely has an identical tertiary structure. yTFIIS is composed of three domains (domains I, II, and III) as defined by limited proteolysis and structural studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (3Morin P. Awrey D. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10604-10608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1). Domains II and III, which together extend from residues 131–309 in yeast, are sufficient for transcription activity. Domain II (residues 131–240 in yeast) contains a three-helix bundle (3Morin P. Awrey D. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10604-10608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and domain III is a zinc ribbon, which contains a three-stranded β-sheet, stabilized by a tetrad of cysteine residues that chelate a zinc ion (4Agarwal K. Baek K. Jeon C. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Yoon H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7842-7851Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Domain II is conserved in TFIIS homologues and is postulated to interact with RNA polymerase II (4Agarwal K. Baek K. Jeon C. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Yoon H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7842-7851Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Domain III is also conserved among TFIIS homologues, and possesses a structural homologue in TFIIB (5Zhu W. Zeng Q. Colangelo C.M. Lewis L.M. Summers M.F. Scott R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and sequence homologues in RPB9 (the ninth largest subunit of RNA polymerase II) (6Woychik N.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TFIIE (7Peterson M.G. Inostroza J. Maxon M.E. Flores O. Admon A. Reinberg D. Tjian R.

The function of the zinc ribbon in each of these proteins is unknown, however, in TFIIS it has been suggested to be involved in binding to both single- and double-stranded nucleic acid (4Agarwal K. Baek K. Jeon C. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Yoon H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7842-7851Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Qian X. Jeon C. Yoon H. Agarwal K. Weiss M. Nature. 1993; 365: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The structures of yeast domain II and domain III of human TFIIS have been solved individually. However, these proteins individually or in combination fail to stimulate transcription elongation. Furthermore, mutations at the junction between domain II and III in human TFIIS can abrogate elongation activity (10Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15375-15380Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggesting an important role for the region linking the two domains. Our aim in this study was to determine the structure of a transcriptionally active yTFIIS fragment. We have mapped the minimal fragment of yTFIIS that retains its structural integrity and full activity to residues 131–309 which comprises all of domains II and III. Our analysis of yTFIIS131–309 had three objectives. First, we wished to confirm that the structures previously determined for the isolated domains accurately reflected the structure of the same region in the transcriptionally active protein. Second, we wished to determine the structure of the 60-amino acid region that links the three-helix bundle of domain II with the zinc ribbon of domain III and determine the relative orientation, if any, of these two domains. Third, we wished to use structural information to design site-directed mutants of yTFIIS, which were destined for use in exploring the function of each of the yTFIIS domains.RESULTSMapping of the Minimal Transcriptionally Active RegionSolution structures have previously been reported for the three-helix bundle of domain II of yeast TFIIS (3Morin P. Awrey D. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10604-10608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the zinc ribbon of domain III of human TFIIS (9Qian X. Jeon C. Yoon H. Agarwal K. Weiss M. Nature. 1993; 365: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 33Qian X. Gozani S.N. Yoon H. Jeon C. Agarwal K. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9944-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Individually, these domains are inactive for stimulation of transcript elongation. Our goal was to analyze the structure-function relationship of a transcriptionally active yTFIIS fragment. To identify a suitable fragment for structural studies, we purified many different N- and C-terminal deletions of yTFIIS and assayed their activity in transcript elongation assays (Table II). Any deletion from the C terminus abrogated activity, but N-terminal truncations up to residue 144 remained fully active. The 143–309 fragment was analyzed by NMR, but proved unsuitable for structure determination because the spectra showed evidence of conformational heterogeneity. However, a fragment containing residues 131–309, yTFIIS131–309, was fully active for transcription activity and had a good quality15N-HSQC NMR spectrum (Fig.2), indicating that it was appropriate for structural analysis in solution. The improved stability of this fragment likely results from the presence of the N-terminal extended strand, residues 137–142, which packs against the first helix of the three-helix bundle of domain II (3Morin P.

Due to the tendency of this protein to aggregate at concentrations greater than 1 mm, combined with the inherent low sensitivity of many experiments for a protein of this size, many of these NMR experiments had low signal to noise and complete resonance assignments could not be made for all residues. Nevertheless, our NMR analysis confirmed that the 3-helix bundle and zinc ribbon structures are present in yTFIIS131–309 and are essentially the same as those determined for the isolated domains. The residues linking the 3-helix bundle with the zinc ribbon do not have a single defined conformation and therefore, additional data such as NMR relaxation experiments and NMR analysis of point mutants were collected in order to better understand the structural and dynamic relationship between the 3-helix bundle, the zinc ribbon and the residues linking them.Structure of Domain IIThe three-helix bundle of domain II, which extends from Lys135 to Lys209, was initially solved in the context of yTFIIS131–240 (3Morin P. Awrey D. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10604-10608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We wished to determine if this structure was conserved in the yTFIIS131–309 fragment and, if so, whether the three-helix bundle interacted with other parts of yTFIIS. To address these questions, the backbone and Cβ chemical shifts of the residues in the three-helix bundle were compared for the yTFIIS131–240 and yTFIIS131–309 constructs. As shown in Fig. 3 A the difference in backbone amide chemical shift values for the two constructs were negligible, as were values for side chain resonances (data not shown). Because the NMR chemical shift is sensitive to changes in protein conformation, this close correspondence indicates that the structure of the three-helix bundle is the same in both yTFIIS131–240 and yTFIIS131–309. Because chemical shift values also reflect the local chemical environment of each nucleus, the data also demonstrated that the three-helix bundle is not tightly associated with domain III of yTFIIS.Figure 3Comparison of chemical shifts of backbone amide resonances of yTFIIS131–309 with those for yTFIIS131–240 (A) and yTFIIS264–309 (B).

In the context of yTFIIS131–309, this region had similar helical propensity based on chemical shift values. However, in neither structure did we observe any long range NOEs that would associate these two helices with each other or the three-helix bundle or zinc ribbon.Structure of the Zinc RibbonThe C-terminal region of yTFIIS131–309 adopts a zinc ribbon structure very similar to the zinc ribbons reported for human TFIIS (9Qian X.

Comparison of the NMR chemical shifts of yTFIIS264–309 with those of the same residues in yTFIIS131–309 showed that this region retains the same structure in both protein constructs and is therefore not dependent on residues N-terminal to it in the sequence (Fig.3 B). The three-dimensional structure determined from data gathered on both proteins consists of a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet composed of residues 279–285 (β1), 293–299 (β2), and 304–308 (β3) (Fig.4). The β-sheets are held together at one end by two zinc-binding loops. The opposite end of the β-sheet orients a flexible loop that is important for function (11Christie K. Awrey D. Edwards A.M.

Several hydrophobic residues of the N terminus of yTFIIS264–309 pack against a hydrophobic patch on the “underside” of the β-sheet (Fig. 4). The β-sheets align well with those of the zinc ribbon of human TFIIS, although the β-sheet in yTFIIS is 1 residue longer at the end with the β1-β2 loop. The main chain atoms of the lowest energy yeast zinc ribbon structures superimpose on those of the human TFIIS zinc ribbon with an root mean squared deviation of 1.23 ± 0.19 Å for residues in the β-sheet of yTFIIS.Figure 4The three-dimensional structure of yTFIIS264–309.

We were unable to assign the resonances of these residues in yTFIIS131–309 due to lack of observable correlations in15N-edited experiments. We interpret the absence of observable amide resonances for these residues as being due to conformational exchange between two or more states resulting in peaks that are too broad to detect. This may explain the proteolytic susceptibility of this region (3Morin P. Awrey D. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10604-10608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Residues 248–263 have strong correlations in 15N-edited and triple resonance experiments, but do not have regular secondary structure as judged by NOEs or CSI analysis. Thus, the chemical shift and NOE data suggest that the 3-helix bundle and zinc ribbon domains are linked by residues that do not have a single defined tertiary, and in some regions, secondary structure. However, lack of NOE distance restraints per se does not necessarily demonstrate motional flexibility.Dynamic Properties of yTFIIS131–309In order to better understand the role of the region linking the 3-helix bundle with the zinc ribbon, as well as the motional and spatial relationship between these domains, we measured 15N NMR relaxation parameters for yTFIIS131–309. The15N-T1, T2,and 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE values of backbone amide nitrogens are dependent on the motions of the protein backbone and therefore reflect the dynamic behavior of the molecule or its domains in solution and can reveal differences in segmental mobility (37Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 38Palmer A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1993; 4: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows a profile of the relaxation parameters measured for each backbone residue. The uniform values for residues within domain II suggest that the 3-helix bundle, together with the C-terminal region of domain II tumble in solution as a single domain. Similarly the values for the zinc ribbon region are also fairly uniform, but on average, slightly lower forT1 and slightly higher forT2 than those of domain II. Residues 248–263, on the other hand, have T2 and heteronuclear NOE values significantly different from those of either domain II or the zinc ribbon. These values for the linker region are suggestive of increased flexibility, relative to the other two domains, however, the significant positive value of the heteronuclear NOE for the linker also indicates that it has restricted motion compared with a fully flexible linker such as that observed in calmodulin (39Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31(23): 5269-5278Crossref Scopus (887) Google Scholar). A more detailed analysis of the dynamics will be presented elsewhere, but this preliminary analysis suggests that the linker region may act as a semi-rigid spacer connecting domain II with the zinc ribbon.Figure 5Summary of the NMR relaxation measurements for yTFIIS131–309. 15N-T1,T2, and heteronuclear1H-15N NOE values are plotted for each residue as a histogram. The absence of a bar at a given position indicates that the amide peak for that residue is either unassigned or overlaps with another peak and therefore its rate of decay could not be evaluated. Domains II and the zinc ribbon are indicated along thebottom. Dashed lines are shown atT1 = 750 ms, T2 = 50 ms, and NOE = 0.6 for easier comparison between values of different domains. The error in each T1 andT2 value is less than 3% and the error in each NOE value is approximately 10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structure-based Analysis of Point MutantsIn order to better understand the role of the linker region in yTFIIS function and to see whether it is structurally coupled to either domain II or the zinc ribbon, we acquired 15N-HSQC NMR spectra of a series of yTFIIS131–309 mutants that were defective for transcription elongation activity. Fig.6 shows a summary of a qualitative comparison of the spectra of each mutant with that of wild-type yTFIIS131–309. Mutants in the linker region such as K242A/Q243A, N252A/N255A/Q257A, T266A/D267A, and LKQKI have only minimal changes in chemical shift compared with wild-type yTFIIS and therefore have conformations equivalent to that of wild-type yTFIIS131–309. We were particularly interested to see the effects of the LKQKI mutation in which a repeat of the sequence between residues 241 and 245 was inserted between residues 240 and 241. Since we were unable to assign the resonances of residues 240–248 in wild-type yTFIIS131–309 (presumably due to conformational heterogeneity) we expected that the insertion mutant would result in either shifted resonances or a new set of peaks that might help us identify the signals of the unassigned residues. However, as shown in Fig. 6 the HSQC spectrum of LKQKI was virtually identical to that of wild-type yTFIIS131–309, suggesting that the inserted residues also undergo some type of conformational averaging which obscures their NMR signals. The fact that mutations in the linker region only affect the chemical shifts of residues immediately adjacent to the mutation in the primary sequence is consistent with a linker that lacks tertiary structure and is not associated with either the 3-helix bundle or the zinc ribbon.Figure 6A summary of the changes in the15N-HSQC NMR spectrum of yTFIIS131–309 mutants relative to the wild-type protein scored according to the following qualitative classification. Small and probably insignificant changes in resonance frequency (<0.08 ppm for 1H or < 0.8 ppm for 15N) were scored as 0.5; medium changes (between 0.08 and 0.2 ppm for 1H or 0.8–2 ppm for15N) were scored as 2; the largest changes (>0.2 ppm for1H, >2 ppm for 15N, or changes so large that the peak for the mutant protein could not be identified) were scored as 3; and the mutated residue is shown as 4, regardless of its change in resonance frequency. The mutation(s) are labeled on theright and residue number along the bottom with domains indicated. The LKQKI mutant has these five residues inserted between residues 240 and 241.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The remaining mutants, D150A, K215A/K217A, Y281A/Y282A, Q283/Q285, and W306A have more extensive effects on the chemical shifts. For example, D150A and W306A have significant changes in chemical shifts for residues throughout the 3-helix bundle and zinc ribbon domains, respectively. Asp150 interacts with His145 in the turn between the N-terminal extended strand (Asp137-Ala142) and the first helix of the 3-helix bundle. This interaction probably stabilizes the packing of the strand against the helix and possibly stabilizes the helix itself. Truncation mutants that retain residue 145 are fully active, but truncations beyond residue 145 are inactive (Table II). Similarly mutation of Trp306 to alanine removes important hydrophobic interactions between β-strands, and from Trp306 to the N terminus of yTFIIS264–309. Importantly, mutations that disrupt the 3-helix bundle do not disturb residues in the remainder of the protein and mutations that disrupt the zinc ribbon are for the most part limited to the zinc ribbon region. This result is further evidence that the 3-helix bundle and the zinc ribbon are structurally independent domains in the context of transcriptionally active yTFIIS131–309. Comparison of the profiles for D150A and K215A/K217A in Fig. 6 indicates that the C-terminal region of domain II is not structurally coupled to the 3-helix bundle, consistent with the NOE pattern observed in both yTFIIS131–309 (this work) and yTFIIS131–240 (3Morin P. Awrey D. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10604-10608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Since the mutants in Fig. 6 are also functionally defective (35Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C.K. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) they reveal important information on the domains of yTFIIS that are required for activity. Clearly a structurally intact 3-helix bundle and zinc ribbon are required, implying that specific surfaces of these motifs are involved in interactions of yTFIIS within the RNA polymerase II elongation complex. As shown in the accompanying paper (35Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C.K. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), inactivating mutations in these two domains that do not disrupt the structure of the protein can reveal surfaces of yTFIIS involved in specific interactions. Since the linker region is not a stable globular domain, the inactivating mutations in this region must be interpreted differently. Inactivating mutations in this domain may destabilize a conformation adopted by yTFIIS in the elongation complex or they may be involved in direct interactions with the complex. Further data is needed in order to distinguish these two possibilities.DISCUSSIONWe have used NMR spectroscopy to study the structure-function relationship of the minimal transcriptionally active portion of yeast TFIIS which spans the proteolytically defined domains II and III. Our results confirm the presence in yTFIIS131–309 of the 3-helix bundle and zinc ribbon structures determined previously for smaller constructs of the yeast and human proteins, respectively. NMR data for wild-type and mutant proteins indicates that the 3-helix bundle and zinc ribbon domains are structurally independent modules linked by the C-terminal portion of domain II and the N-terminal region of domain III. These intervening residues do not have a defined tertiary structure and only a small amount of secondary structure, namely two “nascent” helices between residues 214 and 235. Although the unstructured nature of the linker region makes it impossible to determine a single structure for yTFIIS131–309, we summarize our structural findings with the schematic shown in Fig. 7. The relative orientation of the 3-helix bundle and the zinc ribbon are arbitrary in this view.Figure 7A composite figure of yTFIIS313–309 showing the zinc ribbon structure determined here (right) with domain II determined previously (3Morin P.

A. 1996; 93: 10604-10608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (left) linked by an arbitrarily drawn linker corresponding to residues 238–263 (dashed line). The C-terminal helices of domain II do not have a defined orientation relative to the 3-helix bundle, and therefore are representative of one of many possible conformations that yTFIIS may adopt in the absence of additional macromolecular interactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As described in detail in the accompanying paper (35Awrey D.E.

FtsH forms a homo-oligomeric complex as well as a hetero-oligomeric complex with HflKC, a putative modulator of FtsH. Although FtsH has a small periplasmic region, HflKC is mostly exposed to the periplasmic space. We studied the roles of the periplasmic region of FtsH by engineering mutations in this protein. FtsHΔ236, lacking most of the periplasmic region, retained the in vivo ability to degrade SecY but not CII, resulting in high frequency lysogenization of λ. Several insertion mutations in the periplasmic region of FtsH also differentially affected the proteolytic activities of FtsH. Interestingly, purified and detergent-solubilized FtsHΔ236 was as active as the wild-type enzyme in degrading SecY and CII, although its ATPase activity was lowered 5-fold. Affinity chromatography using histidine-tagged derivatives showed that the periplasmic domain-deleted FtsH no longer interacted with FtsH or HflKC. Although FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc lost the static FtsH-FtsH interaction, it retained the ability to change its conformation in an ATP-dependent manner at 37 °C, leading to a limited oligomerization. These results suggest that the periplasmic region of FtsH has crucial roles in the protein-protein interactions of this complex and in the modulation of its proteolytic functions against different substrates.

Among ATP-dependent proteases of Escherichia coli, FtsH is unique in that it is membrane integrated (1Tomoyasu T. Yuki T. Morimura S. Mori H. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. J.

We identified three membrane-integrated substrates of FtsH: SecY subunit of protein translocase (5Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Tokuda H. Ito K. J. Biol.

Elimination of SecY and F0 a, when they failed to associate with their respective partner proteins, seems to serve as a mechanism to keep the integrity of the membrane (5Akiyama Y. Kihara A.

It is also known that some ftsH mutations cause abnormal translocation of the PhoA moiety attached to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic region of SecY (Std phenotype) as well as significant defects in protein export (3Akiyama Y.

Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These findings raise a possibility that FtsH acts like a molecular chaperone in protein assembly processes. FtsH forms homo-oligomeric complexes in which the amino-terminal membrane region interacts (19Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23485-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It also associates with the HflK·HflC complex (HflKC) (10Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Unlike the prevailing view, HflKC does not itself degrade CII and resides mostly on the periplasmic side of the membrane (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We isolated mutations hflK13 and hflC9, which interfere with the SecY degradation function of FtsH (10Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These mutations stabilize SecY and F0 a but not CII (9Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We also identified a mutation, yccA11, that stabilizes only the membrane-bound substrates of FtsH (9Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The YccA protein is a multi-spanning membrane protein that was shown to be a substrate of FtsH both in vivo and in vitro (9Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The YccA11 mutant protein, having an internal deletion of 8 amino acids near the amino terminus, binds to FtsH and HflKC but is refractory to degradation. The inhibitory effect of YccA11 on SecY degradation was only observed in the presence of HflKC. The proposed function of HflKC is to differentially modulate the proteolytic activities of FtsH against different classes of substrates (9Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this work we carried out mutational analyses of the periplasmic region of FtsH. It was found that mutational disruptions of the periplasmic region resulted in the impairment of the FtsH-FtsH and FtsH-HflKC subunit interactions, affecting the in vivoproteolytic activities of FtsH against the same spectrum of substrates as the hflK13, hflC9, and yccA11mutations. -E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI.

Total membranes from cells expressing FtsH-His6-Myc or FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc were solubilized in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 0 °C for 1 h. After removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation, proteins were incubated with Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen), which were washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 300 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole and eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer (10Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). FtsH-His6-Myc and FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc were purified from overproducing strains TYE024/pSTD113 and TYE024/pSTD243, respectively, as described previously (5Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Tokuda H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31196-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Samples after Ni-NTA affinity column chromatography was used as final preparations except for the gel filtration assay of FtsH aggregation (see below). ATPase activities were assayed as described previously (5Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Tokuda H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31196-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In vitroactivities of FtsH-His6-Myc and FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc to degrade SecY were assayed as described previously (5Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Tokuda H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31196-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, SecY (40 ng) was incubated at 37 °C with either FtsH-His6-Myc or FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc (500 ng) in the presence or absence of ATP (3.3 mm). SecY was visualized by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (29Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Akiyama Y. Cannon K. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Images were produced using ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on x-ray films. In vitrodegradation of partially purified and [35S]methionine-labeled CII was similarly assayed (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) by visualization of CII with a BAS2000 imaging analyzer. Purified FtsH-His6-Myc (13.2 μg protein) was treated with 5 μg/ml trypsin at 0 °C as described previously (18Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A portion of the samples was treated with trichloroacetic acid. The protein patterns were then examined by 16.1% acrylamide, 0.12%N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide SDS-PAGE (30Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), followed by immunoblotting using anti-FtsH serum. FtsH-His6-Myc or FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc was dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. 12.5 μg of the protein was incubated in ATPase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 25 μm zinc acetate, 2.5 mmTris acetate) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 at 0 °C or at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or the absence of either ATP or adenosine-5′-o-(3-thiotriphosphate) (1 mm). Samples were loaded onto Superose 6 column and eluted with ATPase buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. 0.7-ml fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-FtsH serum. We constructed a derivative of FtsH (FtsHΔ236) in which 62 out of 72 residues in the periplasmic region had been deleted. To facilitate detection and isolation of the protein, a His6-Myc bipartite tag was attached to its carboxyl terminus, and the gene was placed under thelac promoter control. The resulting mutant protein, FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc, was detected with anti-FtsH and anti-Myc antibodies as a protein of 64 kDa (data not shown; see Fig. 8for the purified proteins). 2 h after induction, FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc amounted to about 1.5–2-fold the FtsH content in the wild-type cells (data not shown). FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc was fractionated as membrane bound (data not shown). Plasmid pSTD236 carryingftsHΔ236-his6 -myc did not complement the growth defect of the ftsH1 (Ts) or thezgj-525::IS1A (Cs) mutants. SecY is rapidly degraded by FtsH when it has failed to form a complex with SecE (7Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 25Taura T. Baba T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7771-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The LacZα fragment can be used as a reporter of the stability of the amino-terminally attached SecY protein (7Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 31Homma T. Yoshihisa T. Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity of SecY-LacZα (in the presence of an ω donor (LacZΔM15)) was increased more than 2-fold by thezgj-525::IS1A mutation (Fig.1 A, columns 1 and2) at 37 °C, whereas co-expression offtsH-his6 -myc (column 3) lowered the β-galactosidase activity almost to the level in the wild-type cells. It was found thatftsHΔ236-his6 -myc (column 4) exerted a similar effect. Stability of SecY-LacZα was directly examined by pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with the above results, degradation of SecY-LacZα in thezgj-525::IS1A mutant cells was accelerated by the co-expression of FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc to an extent similar to the degradation accelerated by FtsH-His6-Myc. These results indicate that FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc retains almost full SecY-degrading activity. CII is a major determinant of the lysis/lysogeny pathways of phage λ, and its stabilization leads to preferential lysogenization (32Hoyt M.A. Knight D.M. Das A. Miller H.I. Echols H. Cell. 1982; 31: 565-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 33Banuett F. Hoyt M.A. McFarlane L. Echols H. Herskowitz I. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We used an ftsH disrupted strain (AR3291) bearing pSTD233 (ftsH-his6 -myc), pSTD236 (ftsHΔ236-his6 -myc), or pMW119H (vector) as hosts for λ phage infection (TableII). Although ftsH is essential for bacterial growth, a suppressor mutation, sfhC, in AR3291 enables cell growth in the absence of FtsH (6Qu J.-N. Makino S. Adachi H. Koyama Y. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Tomoyasu T. Ogura T. Matsuzawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3457-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).1The strain AR3291 itself showed a lysogenization frequency of almost 100%. When FtsH-His6-Myc was synthesized from pSTD233 in the same strain, lysogenization frequency was decreased to 4.3%. In contrast, the expression offtsHΔ236-his6 -myc from pSTD236 affected the lysogenization frequency only to a small extent (to about 80%). Consistent results were obtained by scoring sensitivity of these bacteria to λc17, which cannot propagate in cells of increased CII contents (33Banuett F. Hoyt M.A. McFarlane L. Echols H. Herskowitz I. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Whereas AR3291/ftsH-his6 -myc was sensitive to λc17, AR3291/ftsHΔ236-his6 -mycallowed far less plaque formation. These results, taken together, suggest that FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc has greatly reduced ability to degrade the CII protein.Table IIEffects of the ftsH mutations on lysogenization of λStrainLysogenization frequencyaLysogenization frequency of λ was determined as described previously (12).%AR3291/pMW119H100AR3291/pSTD2334.3AR3291/pSTD23680AR3291/pINS10415AR3291/pINS1054.5a Lysogenization frequency of λ was determined as described previously (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Direct examination of intracellular stability of CII by pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 2) showed that its half-life in the zgj-525::IS1A cells (with lowered FtsH content) was about 23 min at 37 °C. Although the half-life of CII was shortened to 12 min in the presence of theftsH-his6 -myc plasmid, theftsHΔ236-his6 -myc plasmid did not significantly affect the degradation kinetics of CII. We conclude that FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc is almost inactive in degrading the CII protein in vivo. Impairment of the FtsH functions causes abnormal periplasmic localization of the PhoA moiety attached to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic region of SecY. This phenotype, termed STD, can be assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity as well as examining trypsin sensitivity of the PhoA moiety (3Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5218-5224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thezgj-525::IS1A mutant expressing SecY-PhoA C6 fusion had the PhoA activity that was at least 2.5-fold higher than that in the wild-type strain (Fig.3 A, columns 1 and2). Expression of either FtsH-His6-Myc (column 3) or FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc (column 4) lowered the PhoA activity to the wild-type level. Trypsin treatment of the extract from thezgj-525::IS1A mutant yielded a significant proportion of the PhoA-sized fragment (Fig. 3 B,lanes 5 and 6). The trypsin-resistant proportion was greatly reduced when the mutant cells contained either FtsH-His6-Myc (lanes 3 and 4) or FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc (lanes 1 and 2). These results show that FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc retains an ability to prevent translocation of the PhoA moiety (18Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) of the SecY-PhoA C6 fusion protein. We isolated a series of 31 amino acid-insertion mutations in the periplasmic region of FtsH-His6-Myc using the TnphoA/in method (22Manoil C. Bailey J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We identified four different insertions within the periplasmic region from a total of 10 independent isolates (Fig.4). They were classified into two groups: class I complementing the ftsH1 mutation and class II without complementing activity. It was found that class I mutations had occurred after the 26th or 34th codon, whereas the class II mutations had occurred after the 42nd or 60th codon (Fig. 4). All the insertion derivatives were identified by immunoblotting experiments using anti-FtsH or anti-Myc antibodies as proteins of slightly slower electrophoretic mobilities than FtsH-His6-Myc (data not shown). We chose 105 (class I) and 104 (class II) for further analyses. These insertion derivatives lowered the β-galactosidase activity of SecY-LacZα (Fig. 1 A, columns 5 and6) as well as the PhoA activity of SecY-PhoA C6 (Fig.3 A, columns 5 and 6) in thezgj-525::IS1A mutant cells to the wild-type level. 104 only weakly complemented the λ lysogenization phenotype; it lowered the lysogenization frequency in the ftsH-disrupted cells to 15% (Table II) and made AR3291 (ΔftsH3::kan) moderately sensitive to λc17. In contrast, 105 lowered the lysogenization frequency to 4.5% (Table II) and made AR3291 fully sensitive to λc17. We also examined the remaining insertion mutations. All of the class II mutants were defective in degradation of CII (λc17-resistant) but had nearly wild-type levels of SecY-degrading activity (white colonies on plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoryl β-d-galactoside). Thus, class II periplasmic insertion mutations selectively affect degradation of CII. FtsH forms a homo-oligomeric complex, and this FtsH-FtsH interaction is mediated by the amino-terminal region (16Akiyama Y. Shirai Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5225-5229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23485-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We examined interaction between FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc and FtsH. To minimize possible complication arising from the FtsH-HflKC interaction, we used the hflKC-deleted strain AK990 in which either FtsH-His6-Myc or FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc had been expressed. Nonidet P-40-solubilized membrane proteins were subjected to Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The sample from the FtsH-His6-Myc expressing cells gave two anti-FtsH reacting protein bands in the imidazole-eluate (Fig.5 A). As reported previously (10Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the faster migrating band contained the chromosomally encoded FtsH as well as a carboxyl-terminally truncated form of FtsH-His6-Myc (FtsH′), both of which were brought down because of their interaction with the tagged derivative. In contrast, the chromosomally encoded FtsH was not detected in the eluate fraction when the sample from the cells expressing FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc was used, although FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc itself was normally recovered in this fraction (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that the deletion of the periplasmic region impairs the self-interacting property of FtsH. FtsH forms a complex with HflKC (10Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which can also be isolated using His6-tagged FtsH (Fig.6 A). The ΔftsHstrain was used as a host to avoid any contribution from the chromosomally encoded FtsH. FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc failed to bring down HflKC (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the periplasmic domain of FtsH seems to be important for the FtsH-HflKC association. We previously showed that the products of the hflK13 andhflC9 mutant genes interfere with the SecY-degrading function of FtsH (see Introduction). We examined whether HflC9 interferes with the FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc-mediated degradation of SecY. A plasmid (pSTD241) expressing SecY, HflK and HflC9 was introduced into strain AK990 (ΔhflKC::kan) bearing a compatible low copy plasmid carrying eitherftsH-his6 -myc orftsHΔ236-his6 -myc. Overproduced SecY remained stable even if FtsH-His6-Myc was overproduced (Fig. 7, diamonds), indicating that excess HflK-HflC9 inhibited FtsH-His6-Myc. On the other hand, when FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc was expressed, SecY was markedly destabilized (Fig. 7, squares), indicating that FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc was refractory to the inhibition by HflK-HflC9. We conclude that interaction between FtsH and HflKC is impaired by the deletion of the FtsH periplasmic region. We purified FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc (Fig.8 A). It was found that FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc (0.71 μmol Pi released/mg protein/h) was only about 15 as active as the wild-type protein (4.1) in ATP hydrolysis. Proteolytic activities against purified SecY as well as against [35S]methionine-labeled CII were examined. FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc was as active as FtsH-His6-Myc in degrading not only SecY (Fig.8 B) but also CII (Fig. 8 C). These proteolytic activities were all ATP dependent. It should be noted again that FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc has markedly reduced ATPase activity and that it is devoid of the CII degradation function in vivo. The apparent uncoupling of the proteolytic activities of FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc from the ATPase activity prompted us to examine whether this mutant protein undergoes the ATP-dependent conformational change as was observed for the wild-type protein (18Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, a trypsin-resistant FtsH fragment of 33 kDa was generated both for FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc (Fig. 9) and FtsH-His6-Myc (18Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the deletion of the periplasmic region does not abolish the ATP-dependent structural change. We then studied behaviors of FtsH-His6-Myc and FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc in gel filtration chromatography under various conditions (Fig. 10). FtsH-His6-Myc was mainly eluted at fractions 16–18 (molecular mass of about 1000 kDa as calibrated with soluble protein markers; Fig. 10 A), consistent with an oligomeric structure. Incubation with ATP at 0 °C did not affect the elusion profile (Fig.10 B). Pre-incubation at 37 °C in the absence of ATP rendered FtsH-His6-Myc unrecoverable from any fractions (Fig. 10 C). As the formation of non-filterable aggregates of FtsH was demonstrated previously (18Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the above results should have been due to entrapment of aggregated FtsH-His6-Myc by the prefiltration device of the column. ATP prevented this aggregation of FtsH-His6-Myc (Fig. 10 D) as shown previously (18Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); an FtsH species was generated that eluted slightly earlier (fractions 14–16). FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc was found at fractions (19Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23485-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar, 21Shiba K. Ito K. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 696-701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) corresponding to about 200 kDa (Fig. 10 E). Again, pre-incubation with ATP at 0 °C did not affect the elution profile (Fig. 10 F). In contrast to FtsH-His6-Myc, FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc did not aggregate extensively, even when pre-incubated at 37 °C in the absence of ATP. Although some limited extent of oligomerization was observed for a fraction of FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc, the bulk of it largely retained the original elution profile (Fig. 10 G). These results indicate again that FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc is defective in the FtsH-FtsH interaction. However, when FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc was pre-incubated with ATP at 37 °C, a new form of FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc was found (fractions 15–20; Fig.10 H). This elusion profile indicates some oligomerization. Adenosine-5′-o-(3-thiotriphosphate) gave similar results (data not shown). These results suggest that ATP induces periplasmic domain-independent association of FtsH. We have shown here that the periplasmic domain of FtsH is important for its function. The growth-supporting function of FtsH requires the intact periplasmic domain. The periplasmic region of FtsH is not essential for the in vivo proteolytic activity of FtsH against SecY, but it is required for in vivodegradation of CII. It was shown that FtsH-HflKC interaction is disrupted by the lack of the periplasmic domain. Although the homo-oligomeric interaction of FtsH is also disrupted, the substrate-specific inactivation of FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc may primarily be ascribed to the lack of interaction with HflKC. This is because the ΔhflKC mutant, in which the homo-oligomeric interaction of FtsH is maintained, 3Y. Akiyama, A. Kihara, and K. Ito, unpublished results. exhibits similar deviation in substrate preference of FtsH. In apparent contradiction to the in vivo results, FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc in detergent extracts can degrade both SecY and CII. Thus, FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc retains intrinsic proteolytic activity even against CII. We suspect that the lack of interaction with HflKC may be responsible for the in vivoinability of FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc to degrade CII. In contrast, in vitro conditions in which any topological segregation has been compromised seem to allow the mutant protein to act against CII. We proposed the following mechanism about the ΔhflKC effect in vivo (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HflKC normally acts from the periplasmic side as a negative modulator of proteolysis of membrane-bound substrates. In its absence, FtsH is directed more to the membrane-bound substrates, and soluble protein substrates might escape from FtsH. This “balance shift” model may also explain the phenotypes of FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc, which cannot interact with HflKC. Other explanations may also be possible. For instance, anchoring of FtsH to the membrane may restrict accessibility of substrates to FtsH from the cytoplasmic side. In this case, HflKC will somehow make FtsH overcome such a restriction. HflK and HflC have large periplasmic domains of about 35 kDa (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), whereas the cytoplasmic tail of HflK is only 79 residues long, and HflC has essentially no cytoplasmically exposed region (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Deletion of the cytoplasmic region of HflK does not abolish the FtsH-HflKC interaction.3 Thus, the cytoplasmic domains of FtsH and HflKC do not significantly contribute to their interaction. It is interesting to know whether the transmembrane segments of FtsH and HflKC interact. Our results indicate that transmembrane interaction alone, if any, is not sufficient. Although FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc was only about 20% active in ATP hydrolysis, it exhibited almost full proteolytic activitiesin vitro. The ATP-induced conformational change is unaffected by the Δ236 mutation (Fig. 9). The results of Ni-NTA affinity isolation and gel filtration experiments suggest that FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc in isolation in the absence of ATP exists as a monomer. However, ATP induces some oligomerization of FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc at 37 °C. Thus, although the periplasmic region of FtsH is important for the stable FtsH-FtsH interaction, some other parts in FtsH can undergo ATP-dependent self-association. It is not known whether FtsH can have proteolytic activity in a monomeric state. Unlike the wild-type FtsH that makes extensive aggregates upon incubation at 37 °C in the absence of ATP (Fig. 10) (18Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc did not form such aggregates. Thus, in the wild-type protein, ATP may be partly utilized to prevent the formation of the aggregates, but this ATP requirement is alleviated for FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc, providing a possible explanation for its low ATPase activity accompanied by high protease activity. It should be noted that FtsHΔ236-His6-Myc still requires ATP hydrolysis to catalyze proteolysis. Because neither binding nor hydrolysis of ATP is required for the substrate binding of FtsH (18Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the role of ATP hydrolysis will be in a post-binding processes, in which substrate proteins are presented to the proteolytic active site.

Recent studies have shown that a 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) facilitates the proper folding and subsequent trafficking of LRP within the early secretory pathway. In the current study, we have examined the potential role of Ca2+ and its relationship to RAP during LRP folding. We found that depletion of Ca2+ following either ionomycin or thapsigargin treatment significantly disrupts the folding process of LRP. The misfolded LRP molecules migrate as high molecular weight aggregates under nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. This misfolding is reversible because misfolded LRP can be re-folded into functional receptor molecules upon Ca2+ restoration. Using an LRP minireceptor representing the fourth ligand binding domain of LRP, we also observed significant variation in the conformation of monomeric receptor upon Ca2+ depletion. The role of Ca2+ in LRP folding is independent from that of RAP because RAP remains bound to LRP and its minireceptor following Ca2+ depletion. Furthermore, Ca2+depletion-induced LRP misfolding occurs in RAP-deficient cells. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that Ca2+ and RAP independently participate in LRP folding.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Recent biological studies on LRP have been facilitated by the identification of an array of structurally and functionally distinct LRP ligands that include various circulating lipoproteins and protease/protease inhibitor complexes. LRP is a widely expressed, extremely large glycoprotein of 4525 amino acids, the extracellular domain of which structurally roughly resembles four combined LDL receptor molecules (1Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 2Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Studies by Herz et al. (4Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and Willnow et al. (5Willnow T.E. Moehring J.M. Inocencio N.M. Moehring T.J. Herz J. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have shown that LRP is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain of approximately 600 kDa and in the trans-Golgi network is cleaved by furin into two subunits of a 515-kDa ligand binding domain and an 85-kDa transmembrane domain, which remain associated with one another as they travel to the cell surface. The 515-kDa NH2-terminal subunit binds ligands and remains attached to the membrane through noncovalent association with the 85-kDa transmembrane subunit (4Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The primary structure of LRP is remarkable for its high content of cysteine residues. Most of these cysteine residues are found within clusters of tandemly arranged complement-type or EGF-type repeats within the extracellular domain. Each of these repeats contains ∼40 amino acid residues, including six cysteine residues, which form three disulfide bonds (6Bieri S. Djordjevic J.T. Daly N.L. Smith R. Kroon P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13059-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, a single LRP molecule may contain at least 159 disulfide bonds. This extensive degree of posttranslational modification presents a challenging task for the cell to correctly fold the receptor within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Thus, the folding of LRP, including the formation of disulfide bonds, is likely assisted by enzymes and molecular chaperones. low density lipoprotein LDL receptor-related protein soluble LRP minireceptor membrane-containing LRP minireceptor receptor-associated protein endoplasmic reticulum N-ethylmaleimide mouse embryonic fibroblast polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Indeed, recent studies on the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) have defined the participation of this protein in receptor biogenesis, including its proper folding and trafficking along the early secretory pathway. Using anchor-free, soluble minireceptors that represent each of the four putative ligand binding domains of LRP (sLRPs), our previous studies (8Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) showed that co-expression of RAP is both necessary and sufficient for the correct folding and subsequent secretion of the sLRPs. In the absence of RAP co-expression, sLRPs misfolded as a result of formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds and are retained within the ER with little secretion. In addition to assisting receptor folding, continuous interaction between RAP and LRP along the early secretory pathway is also important for preventing premature ligand binding to LRP. This latter function of RAP correlates its ability to universally antagonize ligand interactions with the receptor (9Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of RAP in the maturation and trafficking of LRP is also supported by gene knockout studies (10Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which demonstrate that cells lacking RAP exhibit ER-retention of aggregated LRP and a 75% reduction in functional LRP. RAP contains three internal repeats (12Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3404-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Our recent studies (14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that the carboxyl-terminal repeat of RAP functions similarly to the full-length RAP in terms of assisting the receptor to fold. However, this repeat of RAP did not emulate full-length RAP in the inhibition of α2-macroglobulin, a ligand for LRP. In contrast, the amino-terminal and central repeats of RAP, which were unable to assist receptor to fold, were found to inhibit α2-macroglobulin binding to LRP (14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These differential roles of the RAP repeats suggest that the effects of RAP in receptor folding and inhibition of ligand interaction are independent functions. It is well known that Ca2+ binds to the LDL receptor (15van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17443-17449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LRP (1Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) and that binding of ligands to members of the LDL receptor gene family is Ca2+-dependent (2Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 3Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of Ca2+ interaction with these receptors was not clear until recently. Examination of the crystal structure of a ligand binding repeat from the LDL receptor revealed that each repeat contains a single Ca2+ ion trapped in an octahedral cage formed primarily by four conserved acidic residues (7Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Interactions between Ca2+ and these acidic residues appear to be important for stabilizing and maintaining the receptor in its native conformation. In the current study, we examined the potential role for Ca2+ in the folding process of LRP. We found that Ca2+ and RAP are independently required for LRP folding, including the formation of correct disulfide bonds. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2 (16Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-1 and MEF-7 cells were cultured under the same conditions, except that Dulbecco's minimum essential medium was used in place of minimum essential medium. Metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine was performed essentially as described before (16Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were generally pulse-labeled for 30 min with 200 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine in cystine-free medium and chased with serum-containing medium for various times as indicated in each experiment. For calcium depletion, either 5 μm ionomycin (A23187, Calbiochem), or 100 nm thapsigargin (Sigma) was included in the chase medium. Cells were lysed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmMgCl2 containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Unless otherwise indicated, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was also included in the lysis buffer to protect free -SH groups. Rabbit polyclonal anti-LRP (generated against purified human LRP) and anti-RAP (generated against recombinant human RAP) antibodies have been described before (13Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-HA antibody was obtained from Babco (12CA5). Immunoprecipitations were carried out essentially as described before (16Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the washing buffer for monoclonal anti-HA antibody contained 0.1% SDS instead of 1% SDS. Preliminary experiments were performed to ensure that the primary antibody used in each immunoprecipitation was in excess. Protein A-agarose beads were used to precipitate protein-IgG complexes. The immunoprecipitated material was released from the beads by boiling each sample for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol) (19Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). If the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed under reducing conditions, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol was included in the Laemmli sample buffer. The percentage of SDS-polyacrylamide gels is indicated in each figure legend. Rainbow molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were used as the molecular weight standards. The construction of the membrane-containing minireceptor of LRP (mLRP4; see Fig. 4) via PCR was performed essentially as described previously (8Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were synthesized in the Washington University School of Medicine Protein Chemistry Laboratory. HepG2 cells at 20–30% confluence were transiently transfected with various plasmids using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Initial transfections were performed in 10-cm dishes using 40 μg of DNA in a total volume of 15 ml of medium. Sixteen h after the start of transfection, cells were washed with medium and cultured continuously for an additional 4 h before being split into multiple six-well dishes (3.5 cm in diameter) for various chase points. Intracellular cross-linking with membrane-permeable cross-linker DSP (Pierce) was performed as described previously (13Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Quenching of the cross-linking reaction was achieved by washing cell monolayers three times, 5 min each, with Tris-buffered saline. To examine whether Ca2+ is required for LRP folding, we analyzed the states of LRP folding upon Ca2+ depletion. We used two approaches to deplete ER Ca2+: ionomycin (A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore) and thapsigargin (an ATPase inhibitor). Human hepatoma HepG2 cells, which express abundant LRP (16Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 30 min and chased for 0, 30, 60, or 120 min with complete medium or complete medium containing either 5 μm ionomycin, 100 nm thapsigargin, or both at the given concentrations. After each chase period, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing (Fig.1 A) or reducing (Fig.1 B) conditions. As seen in Fig. 1 A, at the beginning of the chase, small amounts of LRP existed in aggregated forms (lanes 1, 5, 9, and 13). These LRP aggregates are likely intermolecular disulfide bond-linked LRP molecules because they disappeared when analyzed under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 B). When cells were chased in the presence of ionomycin (Fig. 1 A, lanes 6–8), thapsigargin (Fig. 1 A, lanes 10–12), or both (lanes 14–16), most of the LRP migrated as intermolecular disulfide bond-linked aggregates, which disappeared upon reduction (Fig.1 B). In each case, the increase in LRP aggregates resulted in a corresponding decrease in monomeric LRP. These data suggest that Ca2+ is required for LRP folding and, in particular, the formation of correct intramolecular disulfide bonds. To further examine whether Ca2+ depletion retards the intramolecular disulfide bond formation in addition to promoting the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds, we compared LRP migration patterns in the presence or absence of NEM, which protects free -SH groups during cell lysis. HepG2 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 30 min and chased for 0, 30, or 60 min with complete medium or complete medium containing 5 μmionomycin. After each chase period, cells were lysed in either the presence or absence of NEM, immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP antibody, and analyzed under either nonreducing (Fig.2 A) or reducing (Fig.2 B) conditions. In the absence of NEM during cell lysis, exposed free sulfhydryl groups within cysteine residues can link randomly to other free sulfhydryl groups, including those in other LRP molecules forming intermolecular disulfide bonds. Thus, by comparing the extent of aggregated LRP in the presence or absence of NEM, the free sulfhydryl groups at the time of cell lysis can be compared under various conditions. As seen in Fig. 2 A, and similar to the results shown in Fig. 1 A, LRP aggregation due to Ca2+ depletion was seen when ionomycin was present during the chase (lanes 5 and 6). In the absence of NEM, more aggregated LRP was seen (lanes 10, 11, and12). Most notably, after 30 or 60 min of ionomycin treatment, almost all of the monomeric LRP became aggregated into intermolecular disulfide bond-linked aggregates when cells were lysed in the absence of NEM, whereas without ionomycin treatment, LRP remained predominantly monomeric with little aggregation (lanes 8 and 9). These results suggest that depletion of Ca2+ during LRP folding results in the exposure of free sulfhydryl groups, which probably then form nonnative disulfide bonds with thiols in neighboring molecules. To examine whether misfolded LRP molecules can be rescued upon Ca2+ restoration, we examined the states of LRP folding following ionomycin removal. HepG2 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine for 30 min, chased with complete medium containing 5 μm ionomycin for 60 min, and continuously chased with complete medium without ionomycin for an additional 0, 60, and 120 min. After each chase, cell lysates were either immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP antibody or incubated with activated α2-macroglobulin-Sepharose, and analyzed under either nonreducing (Fig. 3 A) or reducing (Fig. 3 B) conditions. As seen in Fig.3 A, LRP was refolded from aggregated forms into monomeric form upon Ca2+ restoration. The refolded LRP appears to be functional because it is capable of binding its ligand α2-macroglobulin. The very large size of LRP (∼600 kDa) precludes the separation by SDS-PAGE of misfolded monomeric LRP forms with nonnative intramolecular disulfide bonds into discrete species. Therefore, we generated an LRP minireceptor that could mimic the folding process of LRP. This LRP minireceptor encodes residues 2462–4525 (1Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) and represents from the beginning of the fourth cluster of ligand binding repeats (2Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) through the carboxyl terminus of the receptor (designated mLRP4, with “m” denoting that this minireceptor contains the membrane-spanning sequence; see Fig. 4). To facilitate immunoprecipitation following metabolic labeling, an HA epitope was included near the NH2-terminal end of mLRP4. Our previous studies using soluble LRP minireceptor 4 (sLRP4, see Ref.8Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) have shown that proper folding and secretion of sLRP4 requires the co-expression of RAP. Thus, we transiently transfected cDNA for mLRP4 into HepG2 cells with co-transfection of either empty vector (pcDNA3) or vector containing RAP cDNA (pcDNA-RAP; see Ref.13Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 30 min and chased for 0, 30, 60 or 120 min. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing (Fig.5 A) or reducing (Fig.5 B) conditions. As seen in Fig. 5, mLRP4 is folded and transported from the ER to the Golgi faster following co-transfection with RAP (see plot in Fig. 5 B). For example, after 60 min of chase, 66% of mLRP4 had been converted to post-ER forms (including the Golgi form and the processed forms) when co-transfected with RAP, compared with only 29% in the absence of RAP co-transfection (Fig.5 B). These results are consistent with our previous conclusion that RAP facilitates LRP folding and trafficking through the early secretory pathway. It is interesting to note that in the absence of RAP co-transfection, significant amounts of mLRP4 migrated at the top of the stacking gel under nonreducing conditions (Fig.5 A), suggesting the formation of excessive intermolecular disulfide bonds and a concomitant delay for their folding and trafficking. We next examined the effects of ionomycin on the folding and processing of mLRP4. As in the experiment shown in Fig. 5, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA for mLRP4, with co-transfection of either pcDNA3 (-RAP) or pcDNA-RAP (+RAP). The transfected cells were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 30 min and chased in the presence of ionomycin for 0, 30, 60, or 120 min. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing (Fig.6 A) or reducing (Fig.6 B) conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, the depletion of Ca2+ caused misfolding of mLRP4 in both the absence and the presence of RAP co-expression, consistent with the notion that RAP and Ca2+ are independently required for LRP folding (see below). More noticeably, misfolding of mLRP4 can be seen not only as intermolecular-linked aggregates but also as a broad band indicative of heterogeneously folded minireceptor monomers (Fig. 6 A,lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), which likely arise because of mislinked intramolecular disulfide bonds. The interaction between RAP and LRP is known to be Ca2+-dependent (9Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Ca2+depletion with ionomycin decreases the Ca2+ concentration within the ER but does not completely eliminate Ca2+ (18Fasolato C. Zottini M. Clementi E. Zacchetti D. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20159-20167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze whether RAP still interacts with LRP and its minireceptor under the conditions of ionomycin treatment, we performed chemical cross-linking experiments using a membrane-permeable cross-linker, DSP (13Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were transiently co-transfected with cDNAs for mLRP4 and RAP. The transfected cells were then metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 30 min, either followed or not followed by a 30-min chase of complete medium containing ionomycin. Cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of DSP cross-linker, immunoprecipitated with anti-RAP antibody (13Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing (Fig.7 A) or reducing (Fig.7 B) conditions. As seen in Fig. 7, following chemical cross-linking with DSP, LRP and mLRP4 were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-RAP antibody, both without (lane 2) and with (lane 4) ionomycin treatment. Thus, under the conditions of Ca2+ depletion with ionomycin, RAP remains associated with LRP. These results indicate that even when RAP remains associated with LRP, depletion of Ca2+ results in LRP misfolding. To further analyze whether Ca2+ and RAP are independently required for LRP folding, we compared the effects of Ca2+depletion on LRP folding in RAP-expressing MEF-1 cells and RAP-deficient MEF-7 cells (11Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Previous studies by Willnow et al. (11Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) have shown that folding of LRP and its trafficking in RAP-deficient MEF-7 cells is not significantly impaired. In the present study, MEF-1 and MEF-7 cells were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 30 min and chased for 0, 30, or 60 min in the absence or presence of ionomycin. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under either nonreducing (Fig.8 A) or reducing (Fig.8 B) conditions. As seen in Fig. 8 A, in the presence of ionomycin during chase, aggregation of LRP was seen in both MEF-1 (lanes 5 and 6) and MEF-7 (lanes 11 and 12) cells, suggesting that irrespective of whether RAP is present, Ca2+ depletion results in significant LRP misfolding. Ligand binding to members of the LDL receptor gene family requires Ca2+. The underlying mechanism has recently been defined; Ca2+ binds to conserved acidic residues at each of the cysteine-rich repeats and stabilizes the receptors in their native conformation (7Fass D.

In the present report, we analyzed the potential role of Ca2+ in LRP folding and examined its relationship to the function of RAP as a folding chaperone. We found that Ca2+and RAP are independently required for LRP folding. When Ca2+ and RAP are limited during receptor folding, LRP becomes misfolded with the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Intermolecular (also termed interchain) disulfide bonds have been observed in other cases of glycoprotein misfolding, e.g.influenza hemagglutinin (19Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 20Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition to intermolecular disulfide bond-linked molecules, heterogeneously migrating monomeric LRP minireceptors were also observed upon Ca2+ depletion. This suggests that binding of Ca2+ to LRP is important not only in preventing the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds, but also in facilitating the formation of correctly linked intramolecular disulfide bonds. Because ER Ca2+ is also required for the folding process of at least one other endocytic receptor, the asialoglycoprotein receptor (21Lodish H.F. Kong N. Wikstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12753-12760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ca2+ may serve as an essential folding chaperone for some of the endocytic receptors within the ER. The ER is an oxidative environment in which disulfide bond-containing proteins may fold correctly (22Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). The oxidative redox state of the ER maintained in part by the ratio of oxidized:reduced glutathione (GSH:GSSH) at 1:1–3:1 is favorable toward disulfide bond formation and rearrangement (23Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Such an oxidative environment within the ER would also facilitate the spontaneous formation of mislinked disulfide bonds, especially during folding of cysteine-rich proteins. For example, in the pulse-chase experiments performed in the present study (see Figs. 1and 2), we consistently observed intermolecular disulfide bond-linked LRP aggregates immediately following pulse labeling. Binding of Ca2+ and RAP may reduce the amounts of mislinked disulfide bonds, perhaps by protecting certain cysteine residues against oxidation at early stages of LRP folding. In addition, because mislinked disulfide bonds are present during the normal folding process, it is possible that Ca2+ and RAP facilitate the disulfide bond reshuffling process catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, 24Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29399-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, the process of folding for proteins with extensive disulfide bonds is likely dynamic and may involve constant trial and error, especially in the formation of correct disulfide bonds. Rearrangement of disulfide bonds during the normal folding process is also suggested by our observation that misfolded LRP containing extensive intermolecular disulfide bonds can be refolded into functional monomeric LRP (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the ER possesses all the factors and machinery necessary to convert LRP molecules from misfolded states to correctly folded states. Such functions not only support the existence of the trial and error theory of protein folding but also provide a means for cells to recover protein functions following various stress conditions. It is interesting to note that the structure of the fifth complement-type ligand binding repeat of the LDL receptor is organized around a calcium ion (7Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Six residues, including four acidic residues, contribute to the octahedral coordination geometry around the Ca2+ ion. It is possible that the formation of the Ca2+ coordination within each repeat juxtaposes at least two pairs of cysteine residues to form native disulfide bonds. Thus, Ca2+ ions may play critical roles in the initial structure organization during receptor folding, which precedes the formation of disulfide bonds. This hypothesis is supported by in vitrofolding studies on the fifth repeat of the LDL receptor (25Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In an experiment not shown here, we found that depletion of Ca2+following the completion of LRP folding (i.e. 30-min pulse labeling and 60- or 120-min chase) did not induce further misfolding of LRP, suggesting that Ca2+ is not required for maintaining correctly disulfide-bonded LRP structure. However, because Ca2+ is required for ligand binding to LRP (2Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), this metal ion may play a certain role in maintaining the receptor in a conformation that is competent for ligand binding (7Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that Ca2+ and RAP are independently involved in LRP folding. However, whether these factors function in similar ways remains to be determined. It appears from the current study that ER Ca2+ is essential for LRP folding. Depletion of Ca2+ results in the eventual total misfolding of LRP. In contrast, participation of RAP in LRP folding appears to be important but not essential. For example, deletion of the RAP gene by homologous recombination resulted in a 75% reduction but not total elimination of functional LRP molecules (10Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition, when LRP minireceptors are expressed in the absence of RAP-co-expression, some of them appear able to fold and be processed correctly (see Fig. 5 and Ref. 26Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of less efficacious redundant factors or chaperones remains to be defined. Thus, RAP likely functions as a facilitator during LRP folding. The fact that RAP functions in both LRP folding and subsequent trafficking along the early secretory pathway (11Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) emphasizes the specialized chaperone function of RAP during the biogenesis of LRP, and likely other members of the LDL receptor gene family (27Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 272-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In summary, our current results demonstrate that Ca2+ and RAP are independently involved in LRP folding. Ultimately, understanding the folding dynamics of LRP, a molecule with potential complex secondary structure and a high disulfide bond content, should provide us with additional insight as to how such a protein can fold correctly and efficiently within the ER.

https://openalex.org/W2084931044,"The plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays a central role in high density lipoprotein metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. Plasma CETP levels are increased in response to dietary or endogenous hypercholesterolemia as a result of increased gene transcription in liver and periphery. Deletional analysis in human CETP transgenic mice localized this response to a region of the proximal promoter which contains a tandem repeat of the sterol regulatory element (SRE) of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the role of the SRE-like element in CETP promoter activity. Gel shift assays using CETP promoter fragments containing these elements showed binding of the transcription factors, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and Yin Yang-1 (YY-1). Point mutations in the SRE-like element, designated MUT1 and MUT2, resulted in decreased binding of SREBP-1 (MUT1) or SREBP-1 and YY-1 (MUT2). To determine the in vivo significance of this binding activity, CETP transgenic mice were prepared containing these promoter point mutations. MUT1 and MUT2 transgenic mice expressed CETP activity and mass in plasma. In response to high fat, high cholesterol diets, both MUT1-CETP and MUT2-CETP transgenic mice displayed induction of plasma CETP activity similar to that observed in natural flanking region (NFR) CETP transgenic mice. Moreover, in stably transfected adipocyte cell lines, MUT1 and MUT2 CETP promoter-reporter genes showed significant induction of reporter activity in response to sterols. To evaluate transactivation by SREBP-1, NFR- and MUT1-CETP transgenic mice were crossed with SREBP-1 transgenic mice. Induction of the SREBP transgene in the liver with a low carbohydrate diet resulted in a 3-fold increase in plasma CETP activity in NFR-CETP/SREBP transgenic mice, but there was no significant change in activity in MUT1-CETP/SREBP transgenic mice. Thus, SREBP-1 transactivates the NFR-CETP transgene in vivo, as a result of interaction with the CETP promoter SREs. However, this interaction is not required for positive sterol induction of CETP gene transcription. The results suggest independent regulation of the CETP gene by SREBP-1 and a distinct positive sterol response factor.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In the initial steps of reverse cholesterol transport, cellular cholesterol is taken up by HDL and esterified by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. CETP transfers cholesteryl esters from HDL to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with subsequent removal by the liver. The activity of CETP results in formation of smaller HDL species that may be efficient mediators of cellular cholesterol efflux and optimal substrates for the plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase reaction (2Francone O.L. Royer L. Haghpassand M. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 1268-1277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Atger V. de la Llera Moya M. Bamberger M. Francone O. Cosgrove P. Tall A. Walsh A. Moatti N. Rothblat G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In human genetic CETP deficiency, HDL levels are increased but there appears to be an excess of coronary heart disease (4Zhong S. Sharp D.S. Grove J.S. Bruce C. Yano K. Curb J.D. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2917-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Conversely, in hypertriglyceridemic CETP transgenic mice, where formation of small, pre-β-HDL is increased, CETP expression decreases atherosclerosis even while lowering overall HDL levels (5Hayek T. Masucci-Magoulas L. Jiang X. Walsh A. Rubin E. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2071-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These findings could indicate that reverse cholesterol transport stimulated by CETP has an anti-atherogenic role.Plasma CETP levels and activity are increased in response to dietary or endogenous hypercholesterolemia, presumably reflecting the role of CETP in reverse cholesterol transport. This response has been observed in a variety of species including humans (6Son Y.S. Zilversmit D.B. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 345-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Quinet E.M. Agellon L.B.

Mice do not normally have plasma CETP activity. However, natural flanking region CETP transgenic mice express the human gene in an authentic tissue pattern and show 2–3-fold induction of plasma CETP levels and hepatic CETP mRNA when placed on a high cholesterol diet (10Jiang X.C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, after breeding onto LDL receptor and apoE gene knock-out backgrounds, a marked 4–10-fold induction of plasma CETP levels and hepatic CETP mRNA is observed, and there is a close relationship between CETP and plasma cholesterol levels (11Masucci-Magoulas L. Plump A. Jiang X.C. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These changes are due to increased CETP gene transcription in liver and peripheral tissues (10Jiang X.C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In an attempt to define the regulatory elements responsible for increased CETP gene expression in response to hypercholesterolemia, we recently prepared CETP transgenic mice with different lengths of natural flanking sequences (12Oliveira H.C.F. Chouinard R.A. Agellon L.B. Bruce C. Ma L. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31831-31838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A transgenesis approach was necessitated by our inability to obtain robust sterol responses of CETP transgenes or CETP promoter-reporter constructs in cell culture (13Agellon L.B. Zhang P. Jiang X.C. Mendelsohn L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22336-22339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo analysis suggested that a region of the CETP promoter between 138 and 370 bp upstream of the transcription start site was required for the up-regulation of CETP gene expression in response to a high cholesterol diet (12Oliveira H.C.F. Chouinard R.A. Agellon L.B. Bruce C. Ma L. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31831-31838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the middle of this region we identified a tandem repeat of an element highly homologous to the sterol regulatory element (SRE) of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter; also, the presence of an upstream NF-1 site and the promoter position of the SREs were similar in the two genes (14Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13947-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the reductase SRE mediates increased gene expression under sterol depletion conditions (15Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), this suggested either 1) the existence of separate positive and negative sterol response elements in the CETP promoter or 2) the use of a common element (the SRE) for both positive and negative sterol responses.To differentiate between these two possibilities we have prepared CETP transgenic mice with point mutations in the tandem SRE-like elements of the CETP promoter and characterized their response to a high fat, high cholesterol diet. Parallel experiments with wild-type and mutant reporter genes were carried out in cell culture. Mutation of the SRE element did not abolish the positive response to sterols, supporting the first possibility above. Also, mutant and natural flanking region CETP transgenic mice were crossed with mice overexpressing SREBP-1, a sterol-regulated transcription factor that binds and activates the SRE of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter (15Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate in vivo transactivation of the CETP promoter by SREBP-1 via the SRE element. The findings suggest independent regulation of the CETP promoter by SREBP-1 and a distinct transcription factor with a positive response to sterols.DISCUSSIONBy cross-breeding NFR-CETP transgenic mice with SREBP-1a transgenic mice, we have demonstrated in vivo activation of the wild-type human CETP promoter by SREBP-1. In contrast, in another CETP transgenic mouse line containing point mutations in the tandem repeat SRE-like promoter elements (MUT1), there was readily detectable plasma CETP activity, but when the MUT1-CETP transgenic mice were crossed with SREBP-1a transgenic mice, there was no increase in plasma CETP activity. This shows that the effect of SREBP-1 on the activity of the wild-type CETP transgene is due to transactivation of the SRE-like elements of the CETP promoter. Because SREBP-1 is expressed in the liver of chow-fed animals (25Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), these results could indicate that SREBP-1 contributes to CETP gene expression under basal conditions.Although not transactivated by SREBP-1, MUT1-CETP transgenic mice showed induction of plasma CETP activity equivalent to NFR-CETP transgenic mice in response to a high fat, high cholesterol diet. A positive response to the high cholesterol diet was also obtained in mice containing a second mutant CETP transgene, MUT2, which displayed impaired binding of both SREBP-1 and YY-1. Moreover, in contrast to wild-type promoter constructs, both MUT1 and MUT2 reporter genes displayed positive responses to sterol loading in cell culture. These results provide strong evidence that the positive sterol response does not require binding of SREBP-1 and YY-1 to the CETP proximal promoter.SREBP-1, also known as ADD-1, was described as a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor expressed during adipose differentiation (26Tontonoz P.K.J. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). SREBP-1, and the related molecule SREBP-2, were independently identified as transcription factors activating LDL receptor gene expression under sterol depletion conditions in cell culture (27Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 28Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SREBP-1 and -2 exist as larger precursor proteins in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum (30Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 31Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Under sterol depletion conditions, an amino-terminal fragment containing the transcriptional activation domain is liberated by protease activity and enters the nucleus (30Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar,31Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). SREBP-1 also activates SRE-like elements of the rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis (32Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 33Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice with hepatic overexpression of SREBP-1 have massive fatty livers due to increased cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis and also display ectopic hepatic expression of lipoprotein lipase (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The SREBP-1a transgenic mice used in our study also had massive fatty livers after induction with the low carbohydrate diet (Figs. 6 and 7). While these changes (e.g. increased cholesterol biosynthesis) could have contributed indirectly to increased CETP activity, the lack of response of the MUT1-CETP transgene strongly suggests a direct effect of SREBP-1 on the CETP promoter.The in vivo transactivation of CETP expression by SREBP-1 suggests that SREBP-1 contributes to expression of CETP in the liver and adipose tissue. Although originally discovered as an activity induced in cells by sterol depletion, active SREBP-1 was found in the liver in chow-fed hamsters, but it disappeared under cholesterol depletion conditions (36Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In contrast, active SREBP-2 appeared only with cholesterol depletion. Thus, SREBP-1 may contribute to CETP gene expression in chow-fed animals. Recently, SREBP-1 has been shown to be an insulin-responsive factor and to mediate transactivation of certain genes by insulin (37Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Although it is not known if the CETP gene is insulin-responsive, this could theoretically be another way that SREBP-1 could influence CETP gene expression.The SRE-like elements of the HMG-CoA reductase and CETP genes contain a half-site identical with that in the LDL receptor gene, as well as five additional 5′-nucleotides (14Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13947-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may explain why, in addition to SREBP-1, the SRE-like elements of the reductase and CETP promoters also bind the transcription factor Yin Yang-1. As a result of binding to enhancers in different genes, YY-1 can either activate or repress gene expression, and in some circumstances YY-1 can act as a transcriptional initiator (38Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although our studies do not elucidate the role of YY-1 in the CETP promoter, they clearly indicate that binding of YY-1 to the SRE is not essential for CETP gene expression and is not responsible for sterol up-regulation of CETP activity.Interestingly, the MUT1 and MUT2 CETP reporter genes gave a highly reproducible, although modest, positive response to sterols in cell culture, whereas the NFR-CETP reporter gene gave no response. While we cannot exclude a possible role of clonal variation in these different responses, the more robust induction of the mutant promoters could reflect the decreased contribution of SREBP-1 to gene expression. The predominant isoform of SREBP-1 in cell culture (SREBP-1a) is much more transcriptionally active than the major isoform expressed in tissues in intact animals (SREBP-1c) (39Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This high activity of SREBP1a in tissue culture experiments could somehow mask the contribution of the putative positive sterol-responsive factor. Although we have excluded a role of SREBP-1 and YY-1 at the SRE-like element, the unknown positive factor could be acting at this site independent of the point mutations we made (Fig. 1) or at a distinct site in the CETP promoter. In support of the latter interpretation, the SRE-like element is poorly conserved in the related phospholipid transfer protein gene, which is also induced by hypercholesterolemia (40Jiang X. Bruce C.

Recently, LXR, a nuclear hormone transcription factor activated by hydroxysterols, was shown to transactivate a multimerized element of the CYP7A promoter that in some species is induced by a high cholesterol diet (41Janowski B.A. Willy P.J.

However, the CETP promoter does not contain the consensus LXR binding site, and preliminary experiments indicate that CETP promoter fragments do not bind LXR. 3Y. Luo and A. Tall, unpublished data. Steroidogenic factor-1 may also activate transcription in response to oxysterols, but this factor is not highly expressed in the liver (42Lala D.S. Syka P.M. Lazarchi S.B. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Our findings suggest that the CETP gene promoter responds both to SREBP-1 and to an independent positive sterol response factor. This may provide the advantage of complex, graded responses to conditions of sterol deprivation or excess or may allow integrated responses to sterol changes and non-sterol stimuli acting through SREBP-1.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In the initial steps of reverse cholesterol transport, cellular cholesterol is taken up by HDL and esterified by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. CETP transfers cholesteryl esters from HDL to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with subsequent removal by the liver. The activity of CETP results in formation of smaller HDL species that may be efficient mediators of cellular cholesterol efflux and optimal substrates for the plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase reaction (2Francone O.L.

In human genetic CETP deficiency, HDL levels are increased but there appears to be an excess of coronary heart disease (4Zhong S. Sharp D.S. Grove J.S. Bruce C. Yano K. Curb J.D. Tall A.R. J. Clin.

Conversely, in hypertriglyceridemic CETP transgenic mice, where formation of small, pre-β-HDL is increased, CETP expression decreases atherosclerosis even while lowering overall HDL levels (5Hayek T.

Plasma CETP levels and activity are increased in response to dietary or endogenous hypercholesterolemia, presumably reflecting the role of CETP in reverse cholesterol transport. This response has been observed in a variety of species including humans (6Son Y.S. Zilversmit D.B. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 345-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Quinet E.M. Agellon L.B.

Mice do not normally have plasma CETP activity. However, natural flanking region CETP transgenic mice express the human gene in an authentic tissue pattern and show 2–3-fold induction of plasma CETP levels and hepatic CETP mRNA when placed on a high cholesterol diet (10Jiang X.C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, after breeding onto LDL receptor and apoE gene knock-out backgrounds, a marked 4–10-fold induction of plasma CETP levels and hepatic CETP mRNA is observed, and there is a close relationship between CETP and plasma cholesterol levels (11Masucci-Magoulas L. Plump A. Jiang X.C. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These changes are due to increased CETP gene transcription in liver and peripheral tissues (10Jiang X.C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to define the regulatory elements responsible for increased CETP gene expression in response to hypercholesterolemia, we recently prepared CETP transgenic mice with different lengths of natural flanking sequences (12Oliveira H.C.F. Chouinard R.A. Agellon L.B. Bruce C. Ma L. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31831-31838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A transgenesis approach was necessitated by our inability to obtain robust sterol responses of CETP transgenes or CETP promoter-reporter constructs in cell culture (13Agellon L.B. Zhang P. Jiang X.C. Mendelsohn L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22336-22339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo analysis suggested that a region of the CETP promoter between 138 and 370 bp upstream of the transcription start site was required for the up-regulation of CETP gene expression in response to a high cholesterol diet (12Oliveira H.C.F. Chouinard R.A. Agellon L.B. Bruce C. Ma L. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31831-31838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the middle of this region we identified a tandem repeat of an element highly homologous to the sterol regulatory element (SRE) of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter; also, the presence of an upstream NF-1 site and the promoter position of the SREs were similar in the two genes (14Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13947-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the reductase SRE mediates increased gene expression under sterol depletion conditions (15Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), this suggested either 1) the existence of separate positive and negative sterol response elements in the CETP promoter or 2) the use of a common element (the SRE) for both positive and negative sterol responses. To differentiate between these two possibilities we have prepared CETP transgenic mice with point mutations in the tandem SRE-like elements of the CETP promoter and characterized their response to a high fat, high cholesterol diet. Parallel experiments with wild-type and mutant reporter genes were carried out in cell culture. Mutation of the SRE element did not abolish the positive response to sterols, supporting the first possibility above. Also, mutant and natural flanking region CETP transgenic mice were crossed with mice overexpressing SREBP-1, a sterol-regulated transcription factor that binds and activates the SRE of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter (15Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate in vivo transactivation of the CETP promoter by SREBP-1 via the SRE element. The findings suggest independent regulation of the CETP promoter by SREBP-1 and a distinct transcription factor with a positive response to sterols. DISCUSSIONBy cross-breeding NFR-CETP transgenic mice with SREBP-1a transgenic mice, we have demonstrated in vivo activation of the wild-type human CETP promoter by SREBP-1. In contrast, in another CETP transgenic mouse line containing point mutations in the tandem repeat SRE-like promoter elements (MUT1), there was readily detectable plasma CETP activity, but when the MUT1-CETP transgenic mice were crossed with SREBP-1a transgenic mice, there was no increase in plasma CETP activity. This shows that the effect of SREBP-1 on the activity of the wild-type CETP transgene is due to transactivation of the SRE-like elements of the CETP promoter. Because SREBP-1 is expressed in the liver of chow-fed animals (25Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), these results could indicate that SREBP-1 contributes to CETP gene expression under basal conditions.Although not transactivated by SREBP-1, MUT1-CETP transgenic mice showed induction of plasma CETP activity equivalent to NFR-CETP transgenic mice in response to a high fat, high cholesterol diet. A positive response to the high cholesterol diet was also obtained in mice containing a second mutant CETP transgene, MUT2, which displayed impaired binding of both SREBP-1 and YY-1. Moreover, in contrast to wild-type promoter constructs, both MUT1 and MUT2 reporter genes displayed positive responses to sterol loading in cell culture. These results provide strong evidence that the positive sterol response does not require binding of SREBP-1 and YY-1 to the CETP proximal promoter.SREBP-1, also known as ADD-1, was described as a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor expressed during adipose differentiation (26Tontonoz P.K.J. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). SREBP-1, and the related molecule SREBP-2, were independently identified as transcription factors activating LDL receptor gene expression under sterol depletion conditions in cell culture (27Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 28Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Under sterol depletion conditions, an amino-terminal fragment containing the transcriptional activation domain is liberated by protease activity and enters the nucleus (30Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). SREBP-1 also activates SRE-like elements of the rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis (32Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 33Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice with hepatic overexpression of SREBP-1 have massive fatty livers due to increased cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis and also display ectopic hepatic expression of lipoprotein lipase (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The SREBP-1a transgenic mice used in our study also had massive fatty livers after induction with the low carbohydrate diet (Figs. 6 and 7). While these changes (e.g. increased cholesterol biosynthesis) could have contributed indirectly to increased CETP activity, the lack of response of the MUT1-CETP transgene strongly suggests a direct effect of SREBP-1 on the CETP promoter.The in vivo transactivation of CETP expression by SREBP-1 suggests that SREBP-1 contributes to expression of CETP in the liver and adipose tissue. Although originally discovered as an activity induced in cells by sterol depletion, active SREBP-1 was found in the liver in chow-fed hamsters, but it disappeared under cholesterol depletion conditions (36Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In contrast, active SREBP-2 appeared only with cholesterol depletion. Thus, SREBP-1 may contribute to CETP gene expression in chow-fed animals. Recently, SREBP-1 has been shown to be an insulin-responsive factor and to mediate transactivation of certain genes by insulin (37Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Although it is not known if the CETP gene is insulin-responsive, this could theoretically be another way that SREBP-1 could influence CETP gene expression.The SRE-like elements of the HMG-CoA reductase and CETP genes contain a half-site identical with that in the LDL receptor gene, as well as five additional 5′-nucleotides (14Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13947-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may explain why, in addition to SREBP-1, the SRE-like elements of the reductase and CETP promoters also bind the transcription factor Yin Yang-1. As a result of binding to enhancers in different genes, YY-1 can either activate or repress gene expression, and in some circumstances YY-1 can act as a transcriptional initiator (38Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although our studies do not elucidate the role of YY-1 in the CETP promoter, they clearly indicate that binding of YY-1 to the SRE is not essential for CETP gene expression and is not responsible for sterol up-regulation of CETP activity.Interestingly, the MUT1 and MUT2 CETP reporter genes gave a highly reproducible, although modest, positive response to sterols in cell culture, whereas the NFR-CETP reporter gene gave no response. While we cannot exclude a possible role of clonal variation in these different responses, the more robust induction of the mutant promoters could reflect the decreased contribution of SREBP-1 to gene expression. The predominant isoform of SREBP-1 in cell culture (SREBP-1a) is much more transcriptionally active than the major isoform expressed in tissues in intact animals (SREBP-1c) (39Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This high activity of SREBP1a in tissue culture experiments could somehow mask the contribution of the putative positive sterol-responsive factor. Although we have excluded a role of SREBP-1 and YY-1 at the SRE-like element, the unknown positive factor could be acting at this site independent of the point mutations we made (Fig. 1) or at a distinct site in the CETP promoter. In support of the latter interpretation, the SRE-like element is poorly conserved in the related phospholipid transfer protein gene, which is also induced by hypercholesterolemia (40Jiang X. Bruce C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17133-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The identity of the putative positive sterol response factor remains unknown.

Interestingly, the MUT1 and MUT2 CETP reporter genes gave a highly reproducible, although modest, positive response to sterols in cell culture, whereas the NFR-CETP reporter gene gave no response. While we cannot exclude a possible role of clonal variation in these different responses, the more robust induction of the mutant promoters could reflect the decreased contribution of SREBP-1 to gene expression. The predominant isoform of SREBP-1 in cell culture (SREBP-1a) is much more transcriptionally active than the major isoform expressed in tissues in intact animals (SREBP-1c) (39Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This high activity of SREBP1a in tissue culture experiments could somehow mask the contribution of the putative positive sterol-responsive factor. Although we have excluded a role of SREBP-1 and YY-1 at the SRE-like element, the unknown positive factor could be acting at this site independent of the point mutations we made (Fig. 1) or at a distinct site in the CETP promoter. In support of the latter interpretation, the SRE-like element is poorly conserved in the related phospholipid transfer protein gene, which is also induced by hypercholesterolemia (40Jiang X. Bruce C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17133-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The identity of the putative positive sterol response factor remains unknown. Recently, LXR, a nuclear hormone transcription factor activated by hydroxysterols, was shown to transactivate a multimerized element of the CYP7A promoter that in some species is induced by a high cholesterol diet (41Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). However, the CETP promoter does not contain the consensus LXR binding site, and preliminary experiments indicate that CETP promoter fragments do not bind LXR. 3Y. Luo and A. Tall, unpublished data. Steroidogenic factor-1 may also activate transcription in response to oxysterols, but this factor is not highly expressed in the liver (42Lala D.S. Syka P.M. Lazarchi S.B. Mangelsdorf D.J. Parker K.L. Heyman R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1, which is homologous to steroidogenic factor-1, could be another possible candidate (43Escriva H. Safi R. Hanni C. Langlois M. Saumitou-Laprade P. Stehelin D. Capron A. Pierce R. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a novel activity could be involved. Our findings suggest that the CETP gene promoter responds both to SREBP-1 and to an independent positive sterol response factor. This may provide the advantage of complex, graded responses to conditions of sterol deprivation or excess or may allow integrated responses to sterol changes and non-sterol stimuli acting through SREBP-1."

Up-regulation of mRNA levels was associated with a corresponding increase in mAChR binding sites. Two other growth factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), up-regulated m4 mRNA and mAChR binding sites. Treatment of PC12 cells with NGF and bFGF, but not EGF, has previously been demonstrated to result in sustained activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Analogously, NGF and bFGF, but not EGF, increased the stability of m4 mRNA in PC12 cells. In HER-PC12 cells, a clonal PC12 cell transfectant overexpressing EGF receptors and displaying sustained MAPK activation upon receptor stimulation, EGF treatment stabilized the m4 transcript. A synthetic inhibitor of MAPK kinase, PD98059, inhibited growth factor-induced stabilization of the m4 transcript in both PC12 and HER-PC12 cells. These findings demonstrate that the MAPK pathway is involved in transcript stabilization. Cycloheximide pretreatment abolished the post-transcriptional effect of NGF, indicating that de novoprotein synthesis was required for the observed increase in m4 mRNA stability. By contrast, cycloheximide had no discernible post-transcriptional effect if added after NGF treatment, suggesting that an inducible yet stable protein factor was involved in m4 mRNA decay. An unusually well conserved 137 nucleotides of m4 3′-untranslated region has been identified by sequence comparison with other mRNAs that are post-transcriptionally regulated by NGF. In PC12 cells that heterologously overexpress this region, we demonstrate that NGF no longer stabilizes endogenous m4 mRNA. This conserved region probably represents an NGF-responsive element involved in mRNA stability regulation. Finally, transcription of the m4 gene can be induced by all three growth factors but is not dependent on MAPK activity, unlike growth factor-induced m4 mRNA stabilization.

Accordingly, the expression of GPCR genes in neural cells needs to be coordinately regulated in order to integrate the many incoming extracellular cues (for a review, see Ref. 1Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Control of GPCR gene expression can potentially be exerted at the level of transcription and post-transcription (i.e. mRNA degradation) (for reviews, see Refs. 2Lee N.H. Fraser C.M. Wess J.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed effects of NGF on mAChR gene expression have not been identified. NGF and other peptide growth factors are essential for nerve cell development, differentiation, and survival (26Halegoua S. Armstrong R.C. Kremer N.E. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immun. 1991; 165: 119-170PubMed Google Scholar). Growth factor modulation of these cellular processes is accomplished, at least in part, by regulating the expression of specific genes (26Halegoua S. Armstrong R.C. Kremer N.E. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immun. 1991; 165: 119-170PubMed Google Scholar). NGF-induced differentiation of adrenal chromaffin-like PC12 cells to a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype has been associated with the differential expression of several hundred mRNA species (27Lee N.H.

In the present report, the regulation of m4 gene expression in cultured PC12 cells by NGF and two other growth factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), is described. Both post-transcriptional and transcriptional events are implicated as mechanisms regulating growth factor-induced changes in m4 mRNA levels.

In cases where NGF, bFGF, EGF or other treatments were included, the medium was changed every second day, and fresh growth factor was added. At the indicated times, PC12 cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), and total cellular RNA was isolated by a single-step guanidinium-thiocyanate/phenol-chloroform extraction protocol (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 152-159Crossref Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified with oligotex-dT (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as described (18Lee N.H. Earle-Hughes J.

The blot was subsequently processed by successive washes in 2× SSC (2× SSC: 0.3m NaCl/0.03 m sodium citrate) containing 1.0% SDS at room temperature for 30 min with constant agitation, 2× SSC containing 1.0% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min, and 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30–60 min. After scanning with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), the blot was stripped of the m4 cDNA probe, hybridized with a rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe (27Lee N.H. Weinstock K.G. Kirkness E.F. Earle-Hughes J.A. Fuldner R.A. Marmaras S. Glodek A. Gocayne J.D. Fraser C.M. Venter J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The molecular size of the m4 and GAPDH mRNAs in PC12 cells was ∼3.3 and 1.3 kilobase pairs, respectively, which is in agreement with previous studies (6Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R.

The construction of plasmid 118GAPDHpSP73 for generating an antisense riboprobe of the GAPDH mRNA has previously been described (18Lee N.H. Earle-Hughes J. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4291-4298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antisense riboprobe for the m4 mRNA was constructed as follows. PCR primers, 5′-GAATTCGTTCACAAGCATCGACCTG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTGGTGGCCTCTGCGGTGGAC-3′ (underlined sequences areEcoRI and XhoI adapter sites, respectively), were used to amplify 286 nucleotides from Rm4(cRMR1)p11 (6Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was agarose gel-purified, digested with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and XhoI, and subcloned into pSP73 to generate 286Rm4pSP73. Riboprobes transcribed from 286Rm4pSP73 correspond to nucleotides 667–952 of the m4 cDNA clone (6Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Authenticity of all constructs was verified by dideoxy sequencing. PCR primers, 5′-GAATTCGGCCGAAGTGCATAGAGC-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGATCTGTCTCAGCTTAGCATG-3′, were used to amplify a 300-nt fragment of the m4 3′-UTR (nt 1741–2040) from Rm4(cRMR1)p11. The resulting PCR product was agarose gel-purified, digested with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and XhoI, and subcloned into pCDNA3 to generate m4utr-pcDNA3. The plasmid construct was transfected into PC12 cells as described by Lee et al. (18Lee N.H. Earle-Hughes J. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4291-4298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines expressing the 300-nt fragment were screened by RNase protection (18Lee N.H. Earle-Hughes J. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4291-4298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe derived from HindIII-linearized m4utr-pcDNA3 incubated with SP6 RNA polymerase. PC12, HER-PC12, or PC12utr cells were pretreated with NGF, bFGF, EGF, or vehicle. Following treatment, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) to arrest transcription as described (9Fraser C.M. Lee N.H. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Lee N.H. Earle-Hughes J. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4291-4298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the indicated times, total RNA was isolated from cultured cells, and an RNase protection assay was performed as described by Lee et al. (18Lee N.H. Earle-Hughes J. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4291-4298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, EcoRI-linearized 286Rm4pSP73 andStyI-linearized 118GAPDHpSP73 were incubated separately with T7 RNA polymerase and [32P]CTP (50 μCi) at 37 °C for 60 min to generate 32P-labeled antisense riboprobes. The resulting riboprobes were purified from unincorporated nucleotides on a G-50 Sephadex column. 32P-labeled m4 and GAPDH riboprobes (1–5 × 105 cpm each) were incubated simultaneously with total RNA (50 μg) in 30 μl of hybridization buffer for 18 h at 50 °C (18Lee N.H. Earle-Hughes J. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4291-4298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon completion of hybridization, 350 μl of ribonuclease digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) containing RNase A (40 μg/ml) and T1 (2 μg/ml) was added to each assay tube, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 60 min. RNase digestion was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 20% SDS and 5 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml), and RNase-resistant hybrids were ethanol-precipitated and loaded on a 5% acrylamide/7 m urea gel. RNase-resistant m4 hybrid levels were normalized to GAPDH hybrid levels. PC12 cells were treated with NGF, bFGF, EGF, or saline vehicle at the indicated times. Following three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, nuclei were isolated as described by Greenberg and Ziff (31Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). The isolated nuclei (∼5 × 107) were resuspended in 200 μl of glycerol storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm EDTA) and stored at −70 °C prior to use. Nuclei (200 μl) were combined with 100 μCi of [32P]UTP and 200 μl of 2× reaction buffer mix (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8); 5 mmMgCl2; 0.3 m KCl; 25 mmdithiothreitol; and 5 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP) for a final volume of 410 μl and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Upon completion of nuclear run-on reaction, the reaction mix was incubated with RNase-free DNase for 5 min at 30 °C, followed by the addition of 200 μl of SDS/Tris buffer (5% SDS, 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 m EDTA) and 10 μl of proteinase K for 30 min at 42 °C. The radiolabeled RNA was isolated by the single-step guanidinium-thiocyanate/phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 152-159Crossref Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and ethanol-precipitated. The pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of hybridization buffer and hybridized at 65 °C for 36–48 h with 5 μg of the m4 or GAPDH cDNA immobilized onto a GeneScreen hybridization membrane. Membranes were washed as described by Greenberg and Ziff (31Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). All wash buffers contained RNase A and T1. Upon completion of the final wash, filters were treated with RNase for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Blots were analyzed by scanning on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Whole cell binding assays were performed with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) as described previously (18Lee N.H. Earle-Hughes J. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4291-4298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lee N.H. Geoghagen N.S.M. Cheng E. Cline R.T. Fraser C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 140-148PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's ttest. The effects of chronic NGF treatment (50 ng/ml) on mAChR binding sites and m4 mRNA expression in PC12 cells were investigated. Total cellular mAChR binding sites were assessed by receptor binding assays in whole cells. Scatchard analysis of [3H]QNB binding to PC12 cells under basal conditions indicated that mAChR density was 40 ± 3 fmol/mg of total cellular protein with a Kd value of 0.11 ± 0.04 nm (n = 2). Since the affinity of [3H]QNB did not change significantly with 12-day NGF treatment (Kd = 0.10 ± 0.02 nm; n = 3), subsequent time course experiments on mAChR density were measured using a saturating radioligand concentration of 2 nm. Incubation of PC12 cells with 50 ng/ml NGF induced a time-dependent up-regulation of mAChR density that was evident by day 3 and maximal (3-fold increase) by days 12–15 (Fig.1). The observed changes in whole cell mAChR binding sites following NGF treatment were absent in saline-treated PC12 cells maintained in culture for up to 15 days (data not shown). These findings agree with a previous study demonstrating that increases in mAChR binding sites in plasma membrane homogenates of PC12 cells depended on NGF and not the duration of cell culture (25Jumblatt J.E. Tischler A.S. Nature. 1982; 297: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Quantification of m4 mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the up-regulation of mAChR binding sites was accompanied by an induction of steady-state mRNA levels (Fig. 1). The time courses for induction of mRNA and protein levels were nearly identical. NGF-induced up-regulation of m4 mRNA levels was significant (p < 0.05) by day 3 (1.8-fold increase) and maximal by days 12–15 (3–4-fold). GAPDH mRNA levels were unaffected by NGF treatment (Fig. 1). As seen for mAChR density, steady state m4 mRNA levels were not affected in cells treated with saline for 0–15 days (data not shown). Changes in steady-state mRNA levels may be attributable to alterations in the degradation rate of a transcript and/or rate of gene transcription (3Lee N.H. Tobin A. The Phosphoinositidase C Pathway: Its Regulation and Desensitization. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 133-158Google Scholar). Hence, the relative contribution of a post-transcriptional mechanism in the modulation of m4 mRNA levels by NGF was addressed. For mRNA decay experiments, PC12 cells pretreated with NGF (50 ng/ml) or saline were incubated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) to arrest transcription. The decay of m4 mRNA was followed by RNase protection assay. The RNase-resistant hybrids are shown in Fig.2 A. In control PC12 cells treated with saline (15 days), m4 mRNA displayed a basal half-life of 1.4 h (Fig. 2 B; TableI). This half-life value was not significantly different from those obtained in control cells treated with saline for 3 and 12 days (data not shown). Therefore, the basal half-life of m4 mRNA was not influenced by the length of time cells were maintained in culture. In contrast, the basal half-life of the m4 mRNA significantly increased (p < 0.05) by ∼4-fold to 5.6, 5.3, and 4.6 h following 3, 9, and 15 days of NGF treatment, respectively (Fig. 2 B; Table I).Table IHalf-lives of the m4 mRNACell lines and treatmentsMean ± S.E.

The effects of two other growth factors on m4 gene expression were examined for comparison with NGF-induced changes. Both bFGF (10 ng/ml) and EGF (50 ng/ml) increased [3H]QNB binding in intact PC12 cells with maximal increases occurring by day 12 and 9, respectively (Figs.3 and 4). Maximal up-regulation of mAChR density was 4.5- and 2-fold with bFGF and EGF treatment, respectively. While induction of steady-state m4 mRNA levels coincided with the up-regulation of mAChR density following NGF treatment (Fig. 1), induction of m4 mRNA levels preceded receptor up-regulation when cells were treated with either bFGF or EGF (Figs. 3 and 4). For instance, mRNA levels were maximally increased 4- and 3-fold by day 3 of bFGF and EGF treatment, respectively (Figs. 3 and 4). However, both growth factors had only marginal effects, if any, on mAChR density during this same time period. The temporal regulation of steady-state m4 mRNA levels appeared to be biphasic when cells were treated with either bFGF or EGF; nevertheless, mRNA levels remained significantly elevated for up to 15 days (p < 0.05).Figure 4Effects of EGF on m4 mRNA and protein.

Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from cultured cells following EGF treatment (50 ng/ml) at the indicated days. Control (ctrl) represents day 0 of treatment. Northern blot was hybridized with the m4 and GAPDH cDNA probes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Northern blot is representative of three independent experiments. B, time course for EGF up-regulation of m4 mAChR sites and mRNA levels. mAChR sites were quantitated by whole cell binding assays with a saturating concentration of 2 nm [3H]QNB following NGF treatment. For Northern blot analysis, blots were quantitated by densitometry, where m4 mRNA levels are expressed relative to GAPDH mRNA. Receptor binding data shown are the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments performed in triplicate. The densitometric data from Northern blot analysis are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2135805572,"Abstract The two mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) binding sites of the insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/MPR) have been localized to domains 1–3 and 7–9, and studies have shown that Arg435 in domain 3 and Arg1334 in domain 9 are essential for Man-6-P binding. To determine whether the IGF-II/MPR containing a single Man-6-P binding site is functional, clonal mouse L cell lines stably transfected with either mutant bovine IGF-II/MPR cDNA, containing substitutions at position 435 and/or 1334, or the wild type receptor cDNA were assayed for their ability to sort lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome. Mutant receptors containing a single Man-6-P binding site were ∼50% less efficient than the wild type receptor in the overall targeting of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome. Mutant receptors containing a substitution at Arg1334 (Dom9Ala), in contrast to those containing a substitution at Arg435(Dom3Ala), were unable to target cathepsin D and β-hexosaminidase to the lysosome. Equilibrium binding assays using125I-labeled β-glucuronidase demonstrated that Dom3Ala and Dom9Ala had aK d of 2.0 and 4.3 nm, respectively. In addition, Dom3Ala, unlike Dom9Ala, was unable to completely dissociate from ligand under acidic pH conditions. These data indicate that the two Man-6-P binding sites of the IGF-II/MPR are not functionally equivalent."
https://openalex.org/W1983511319,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected T-cells constitutively express surface Fas ligand (FasL), which may serve as a mechanism of viral pathogenesis. HTLV-I induces transcription of FasL gene through the viral transactivator Tax, although the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we have analyzed both the cis-activating element and transactivating factors involved in Tax activation of the FasL promoter. We show that the 486-base pair upstream region of the human FasL gene is sufficient for Tax-mediated transactivation in Jurkat T-cells. Interestingly, a palindromic DNA sequence (GGAAACTTCC) covering the consensus NF-ATp binding site (GGAAA), is required for Tax activation of FasL promoter. The involvement of NF-AT in this transactivation event is suggested by the finding that Tax fails to activate the FasL promoter in a Jurkat T-cell line defective in capacitative calcium entry, a signaling mechanism involved in NF-AT activation. Furthermore, activation of FasL promoter by Tax is largely attenuated in the nonlymphoid F9 embryonal and COS kidney cells deficient in NF-ATp expression. DNA-protein interaction assays reveal that the NF-AT-like motif in the FasL promoter is bound by both NF-ATp and NF-AT4 in Jurkat T-cells expressing Tax. The binding of NF-ATp, although not NF-AT4, to this enhancer also occurs along with HTLV-I-mediated infection of human peripheral blood T-cells. Furthermore, exogenously transfected NF-ATp binds to the NF-AT-like enhancer and participates in Tax-mediated FasL promoter transactivation.

Although Tax clearly plays a key role in HTLV-I-induced T-cell growth and transformation, recent studies have suggested additional functions for this viral transactivator. Specifically, Tax is shown to transactivate the gene encoding Fas ligand (FasL) (17Chen X. Zachar V. Zdravkovic M. Guo M. Ebbesen P. Liu X. J. Gen.

The FasL/Fas-mediated apoptosis is largely controlled by the expression of FasL. Although Fas is constitutively expressed in a large variety of cell types and tissues (21Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Itoh N. Yonehara S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1274-1279PubMed Google Scholar), FasL is predominantly expressed in activated T-cells (20Suda T. Okazaki T. Naito Y. Yokata N. Arai N. Ozaki S. Nakao K. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3806-3813PubMed Google Scholar). The induced expression of FasL in activated T-cells provides an important mechanism for the immune system to limit the expansion of antigen-stimulated T-cells when they are no longer needed (22Lynch D.H. Ramsdell F. Alderson M.R. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 569-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In addition to its inducible expression in T-cells, FasL is constitutively expressed in stroma cells of retina and Sertoli cells of testis (23Griffith T. Brunner T. Fletcher S. Green D. Ferguson T. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 24Bellgrau D. Gold D. Selawry H. Moore J. Franzusoff A. Duke R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). At these sites, FasL appears to induce apoptosis in infiltrating activated lymphocytes, a mechanism involved in the maintenance of immune privilege (23Griffith T. Brunner T. Fletcher S. Green D. Ferguson T. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 24Bellgrau D. Gold D. Selawry H. Moore J. Franzusoff A. Duke R.C.

Interestingly, recent studies have shown that certain tumor cells, including those of nonlymphoid origin, constitutively express FasL, which contributes to immune privilege of tumors (26Hahne M. Rimoldi D. Schröter M. Romero P. Schreier M. French L.E. Schneider P. Bornand T. Fontana A. Lienard D. Cerottini J.-C. Tschopp J.

Med. 1996; 184: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Similarly, viruses may induce the expression of FasL in host cells, providing a route for escaping the immune destruction. In this regard, the Nef protein of simian immune deficiency virus has been shown to up-regulate FasL, leading to apoptotic death of virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells (28Xu X.-N. Screaton G.R. Gotch F.M. Dong T. Tan R. Almond N. Walker B. Stebbings R. Kent K. Nagata S. Stott J.E. McMichael A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the HTLV-I Tax protein also induces expression of FasL, although it remains to be examined whether the Tax-expressing cells participate in the inactivation of anti-HTLV immune response. Nevertheless, Tax has been shown to induce cell death in vitro (29Yamada T. Yamaoka S. Goto T. Nakai M. Tsujimoto Y. Hatanaka M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3374-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chlichlia K. Moldenhauer G. Daniel P.T. Busslinger M. Gazzolo L. Schirrmacher V. Khazaie K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 269-277PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that Tax induces the viral and cellular genes by targeting two major cellular transcription factor pathways, the NF-κB/Rel and CREB/ATF (31Greene W.C. Bohnlein E. Ballard D.W. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 272-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Smith M.R. Greene W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Specifically, Tax activates long terminal repeat (LTR) of HTLV-I by physical interaction with the CREB/ATF family of proteins, which specifically bind to the 21-base pair repeats present in HTLV-I LTR (33Zhao L.J. Giam C.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11445-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 34Suzuki T. Fujisawa J.I. Toita M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, Tax-mediated activation of many cellular genes, such as IL-2 receptor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, is mediated by the NF-κB/Rel transcription factors (16Miyatake S.

Additionally, we and others have recently shown that Tax induces the transcription of the IL-2 gene through activation of cellular transcription factors that bind to an IL-2 gene enhancer termed CD28-responsive element (CD28RE) (40Li M.

NF-AT represents a family of enhancer binding proteins that participate in the regulation of IL-2 as well as a large number of other cytokine genes (47Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev.

Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism by which theFasL gene is transcriptionally induced in Tax-expressing cells. We provide evidence showing the involvement of NF-AT in Tax-mediated FasL promoter transactivation. The Jurkat leukemic T-cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Jurkat cells stably transfected with a Tax cDNA expression vector (Jurkat-Tax (60Wano Y. Feinberg M. Hosking J. Bogerd H. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mutant cell line M108 and its parental wild type control (Jurkat-Trunc) were kindly provided by Dr. G. Crabtree (61Serafini A.T. Lewis R.S. Clipstone N.A. Bram R.J. Fanger C. Fiering S.

Kubonishi I. Yoshimoto S. Shiraishi Y. Gann. 1981; 72: 978-981PubMed Google Scholar) and was cultured in RPMI medium. Monkey kidney COS7 cells were cultured in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. The cDNA expression vectors encoding NF-ATpFL, NF-ATpXS, and Tax and its mutants have been described previously (63Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell.

The luciferase reporter plasmids driven by a 486-bp upstream sequence from the wild type (FasL-luc, previously named CD95L-486) or mutant form (FasLMut-luc, previously named CD95L-486 mutant) of FasL promoter were obtained from Dr. G. Koretzky (65Latinis K.M. Carr L.I. Peterson E.J. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4602-4611PubMed Google Scholar). The κB-TATA-luc and HTLV-I LTR-luc have been described (66Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Béraud C. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7377-7384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,67Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera for NF-AT3, NF-AT4, and NF-ATc were kindly provided by Dr. N. R. Rice (68Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Anti-NF-ATp was purchased from Upstate Biochemicals, Inc. The anti-Tax monoclonal antibody was prepared from a hybridoma (168B17-46-34) provided by the AIDS Research and Reference Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. Antisera for various NF-κB subunits were either provided by Dr. W. C. Greene (p50, p52, and RelA) or obtained from Santa Cruz, Inc. (c-Rel and Bcl-3). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared from T-cell-enriched human blood (Biological Specialty Corporation, Colmar, Pennsylvania) with a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cells were stimulated for 36 h with phytohemaglutinin (2 μg/ml) and then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, antibiotics, and 25 units/ml human recombinant IL-2. Proliferating T-cells were isolated from the PBMC by negative selection using the Enrichment Immunecolumns (Biotex Laboratories Inc., Edmonton, Alberta). For obtaining resting PBMC or T-cells, the cells were washed twice with RPMI lacking IL-2 followed by incubating the cells in the same medium for 24–30 h. In vitro transformation of T-cells with HTLV-I was performed as described previously (69Merl S. Kloster B. Moore J. Hubbell C. Tomar R. Davey F. Kalinowski D. Planas A. Ehrlich G. Clark D. Blood. 1984; 64: 967-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 70Persaud D. Munoz J.L. Tarsis S.L. Parks E.S. Parks W.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6297-6303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, phytohemaglutinin-stimulated PBMC was cocultured with γ-irradiated HTLV-I donor cells (MT-2) in the IL-2-containing RPMI medium. The cells were diluted when the medium became acidic (as indicated by its color change). As controls, PBMC and γ-irradiated MT-2 cells were cultured separately under the same conditions. As expected (69Merl S. Kloster B. Moore J. Hubbell C. Tomar R. Davey F. Kalinowski D. Planas A. Ehrlich G. Clark D. Blood. 1984; 64: 967-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 70Persaud D. Munoz J.L. Tarsis S.L. Parks E.S. Parks W.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6297-6303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transformed T-cells started dominating the PBMC/MT-2 coculture after 4 to 5 weeks. These transformed cells were continuously proliferating when exogenous IL-2 was provided, a characteristic of T-cells at early stage of HTLV-I infection (71Feuer G. Chen I.S.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 223-233PubMed Google Scholar, 72Sodroski J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 19-29PubMed Google Scholar). Under the same culturing conditions, the uninfected control PBMC usually ceased growth between 2 to 4 weeks, and the γ-irradiated MT-2 cells never grew (data not shown). The HTLV-I-immortalized T-cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with IL-2 and used as bulk population. Normal T-cells were collected after 1–2 weeks of cultivation and frozen in RPMI supplemented with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide until use. To re-start the culture, the frozen cells were washed once with RPMI medium and then cultured in the same medium supplemented with IL-2. Jurkat cells (1.25 × 106) were transfected using DEAE-dextran (73Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with a luciferase reporter (2.5 μg for FasL-luc or its control luc, 0.1 μg for κB-TATA-luc, 0.1 μg for HTLV-I LTR-luc) together with the indicated amount of effector cDNA expression vectors. After 40–48 h, the recipient cells were either left untreated or incubated with the indicated inducers for 8 h and then subjected to extract preparation using a reporter lysis buffer (Luciferase reagent, Promega) at about 40 μl/106 cells. Luciferase activity was detected by mixing 5 μl of extract with 20 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega) and measured with a single photon channel of a scintillation counter (Beckman). Monkey kidney COS7 cells were seeded in 0.1% gelatin-treated 12-well plates (1.5 × 105cells/well) 1 day before transfection and then transfected using DEAE-dextran (73Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as described previously (74Ganchi P.A. Sun S.-C. Greene W.C. Ballard D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). F9 cells were seeded onto 0.1% gelatin-treated 12-well plates (1.5 × 105cells/well) 1 day before transfection and were transfected using LipofectamineTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 40–48 h, recipient COS or F9 cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase assays as described above. Normal human peripheral blood T-cells and HTLV-I-immortalized T-cells were starved for 24–30 h in RPMI growth medium lacking exogenous IL-2. Jurkat or Jurkat-Tax cells were directly collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from these T-cells as described previously (75Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected in 6-well plates using DEAE-dextran (73Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the indicated cDNA expression vectors and subjected to whole-cell extract preparation (76Good L. Sun S.-C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2730-2735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA was performed by incubating the protein extracts with a32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe covering an NF-AT-like sequence located at −278 to −261 (from the ATG site) of the FasL promoter (77Takahashi T. Tanaka M. Inazawa J. Abe T. Suda T. Nagata S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) (the coding strand sequence was 5′-GCG GAA ACT TCC AGG GGT-3′) followed by resolving the DNA-protein complexes on native 5% polyacrylamide gels (78Ballard D.W. Bohnlein E. Hoffman J. Bogerd H. Dixon E.P. Franza B.R. Greene W.C. New Biol. 1989; 1: 83-92PubMed Google Scholar). For antibody supershift assays, 0.5 μl of diluted or undiluted polyclonal antisera was added to the EMSA reactions 15 min before electrophoresis. The anti-NF-ATp antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology) was diluted 10 times or as indicated; antisera for all the other proteins were used undiluted. To localize the regions of FasL promoter that modulates Tax-mediated transactivation signal, we examined whether a truncated FasL promoter covering a 486-bp sequence upstream of its translational initiation site (ATG) could respond to Tax. For these studies, a control luciferase plasmid (Luc) lacking a promoter or a luciferase reporter driven by the 486-bp FasL promoter sequence (FasL-luc, for sequence information, see Ref. 77Takahashi T. Tanaka M. Inazawa J. Abe T. Suda T. Nagata S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) was transfected into Jurkat T-cells either alone or together with Tax. As expected, Tax had no significant effect on the expression of the control luciferase reporter (Fig.1 A, column 2). However, this viral transactivator potently induced the FasL-luc expression, resulting in an marked increase in luciferase activity (column 4). We also examined whether Tax synergized with other FasL-stimulating signals. In this regard, recent studies demonstrated that FasL promoter could be activated by mitogens, including phorbol 12-myristic 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (65Latinis K.M. Carr L.I. Peterson E.J. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4602-4611PubMed Google Scholar), which stimulate the protein kinase C and calcium signals, respectively. We found that stimulation of Jurkat cells with PMA together with ionomycin led to a low level (3–4-fold) induction of the FasL-luc reporter gene activity (Fig. 1 B, column 4). When the cells were transfected with the Tax expression vector, however, a markedly higher level of reporter gene activity was induced by these mitogens (column 8). Stimulation of the Tax-expressing cells with PMA and ionomycin separately also potentiated certain levels of Tax-mediated transactivation (columns 6 and 7). Thus, the proximal region of the FasL promoter contains the Tax-responsive regulatory elements, and the mitogenic signals synergize with Tax in the induction of the FasL promoter activity. Prior studies have demonstrated that Tax activation of many target genes is mediated by NF-κB or CREB/ATF transcription factors (32Smith M.R. Greene W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and mutational analyses have led to the identification of Tax mutants def"

Furthermore, the putative heparin-specificN-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase has been reported to require auxiliary proteins for itsN-acetylglucosaminyl N-deacetylase activityin vivo based on its requirement of polycations in vitro. We have now found that cells derived from embryonic bovine trachea, a tissue that does not synthesize heparin, has aN-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, which has 95% amino acid sequence identity to the above enzyme postulated to be involved in the biosynthesis of heparin. Both enzymes also have very similar affinity for their substrates. The trachea enzyme does not require additional effectors for its N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase activity in vitro even though its biochemical characteristics are virtually the same as the enzyme previously isolated from cells of a heparin-producing mastocytoma tumor. The trachea enzyme, which is encoded by an abundant 4.6-kilobase mRNA, like mastocytoma cells, has 70% amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding enzyme from rat liver postulated to participate in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate synthesized by trachea cells has a higher content of sulfated iduronic acid than from other tissues. Together, the above results strongly suggest that the above enzymes from mastocytoma, liver, and trachea, per se, are not solely responsible for the selective tissue-specific synthesis of heparin or heparan sulfate; more likely cellular factors, additional enzymes, and availability of substrates in the Golgi lumen also play important roles in the differential synthesis of the above proteoglycans.

Nevertheless, they appear to share biosynthetic pathways, beginning with the polymerization of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, followed by the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine, subsequent epimerization of glucuronic acid to l-iduronic acid, 2-O-sulfation of this latter sugar and 6-O-sulfation of glucosamine (12Salmivirta M.

Biochemical characteristics suggest that this enzyme is involved in the synthesis of a highly sulfated heparan sulfate. These studies, therefore, strongly suggest that the above N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, per se, is unlikely to be solely responsible for the differential biosynthesis of heparin versus heparan sulfate; probably cellular factors in heparin-producing cells are also responsible for the differential biosynthesis of these two proteoglycans.DISCUSSIONWe have unexpectedly found in cells from a tissue that does not synthesize heparin a very abundant message encoding a protein that has 95% sequence identity with the putative heparinN-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase. The protein has biochemical characteristics very similar to the mastocytoma and not the rat liver N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (15Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z.

They further hypothesized that endogenous polycations in mast cells, probably polypeptides, are required for theN-acetylglucosaminyl N-deacetylase activityin vivo.We differ in the interpretation of the above results. We believe that the purified enzyme from mastocytoma (17Cheung W.F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), in a manner analogous to the purified one from rat liver (27Brandan E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2417-2422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has lost during the many purification steps its ability to N-deacetylateN-acetylglucosamine of heparin or heparan sulfate in vitro; in the presence of polycations, this activity is regained in assays in vitro. When a soluble chimera of the heparin/heparan sulfate N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase of either MST cells or rat liver with protein A is expressed and secreted, thus allowing a rapid, one-step purification of the enzyme by its binding to IgG beads both proteins have both catalytic activities in assays in vitro without need of polycations (14Wei Z. Swiedler S. Ishihara M. Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3885-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same result was obtained with the above described trachea cell-derived enzyme.The above results describing that bovine trachea-derived cells contain a N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, resembling the mastocytoma enzyme and not the rat liver enzyme, require a re-examination of the hypothesis that the mastocytoma enzyme is necessary for the synthesis of heparin and not heparan sulfate, whereas the liver one is required for heparan sulfate and not heparin. It would appear more likely that the decision as to whether a cell synthesizes heparin or heparan sulfate may depend on the presence of specific heparin or heparan sulfate precursor intermediates and additional cellular factors rather than solely specificN-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase. Among such factors may be the availability of PAPS (28Conrad H.E. Heparin Binding Proteins. Academic Press, New York1998: 175-176Google Scholar) or nucleotide sugars in the Golgi lumen; the Km of the different acceptors for these nucleotide derivatives and other possible effectors that are not yet characterized. Because current approaches in vitrowith non-physiological substrates such as K5 are subject to equivocal interpretation, definite answers to this important question will have to await gene disruption studies of these enzymes and replacement of one enzyme for the other in different cells.We have recently shown that availability of nucleotide sugars in the Golgi lumen greatly influences which glycosaminoglycan chains are synthesized; thus, in MDCK cells having limited availability of UDP-galactose in the Golgi lumen, the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proceeds normally, whereas that of keratan sulfate is abolished (29Toma L. Pinhal M.A. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3897-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We had previously shown in biochemical and genetic experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae that the nucleotide sugar/nucleoside phosphate antiporter system, which provides in the Golgi lumen substrates for the biosynthesis of oligosaccharides, plays a regulatory role in determining which macromolecules are synthesized within the lumen (30Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Hausler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 122: 307-323Google Scholar, 31Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The previous description of such an antiporter system in mammalian Golgi membranes (32Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the above results with MDCK cells (29Toma L. Pinhal M.A. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3897-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that such an antiporter system plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of either heparin or heparan sulfate. Furthermore, in the above mutant MDCK cells, chondroitin 4-sulfate became hypersulfated in the 6-O-position (29Toma L. Pinhal M.A. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3897-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), perhaps because of a lack of absolute substrate specificity of a putative keratan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase.In conclusion, we believe that it is unlikely that the heparin/heparan sulfate N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase per se is solely responsible for the selective synthesis of heparin or heparan sulfate and that cellular factors including availability of substrates in the Golgi lumen may also play important roles in the differential synthesis of the above proteoglycan. Heparan sulfate and heparin are proteoglycans with sulfated glycosaminoglycans of alternating glucosamine and uronic acid; heparin has a higher content of iduronic acid and sulfate than heparan sulfate. The latter plays biological roles in cell recognition (1Lupa M.T. Gordon H. Hall Z.W. Dev. Biol. 1990; 142: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), cell adhesion (2LeBaron R.G. Esko J.D.

Heparin and heparan sulfate also occur in different tissues, the latter being present in virtually all mammalian ones, whereas heparin is restricted to connective tissue mast cells (11Nader H.B. Dietrich C.P. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin. 1989: 81-96Google Scholar). Nevertheless, they appear to share biosynthetic pathways, beginning with the polymerization of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, followed by the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine, subsequent epimerization of glucuronic acid to l-iduronic acid, 2-O-sulfation of this latter sugar and 6-O-sulfation of glucosamine (12Salmivirta M.

We have now found that non-heparin-producing cells have anN-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase virtually identical in amino acid sequence and substrate affinity to the putative heparin N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase previously isolated from mastocytoma or MST cells. Biochemical characteristics suggest that this enzyme is involved in the synthesis of a highly sulfated heparan sulfate. These studies, therefore, strongly suggest that the above N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, per se, is unlikely to be solely responsible for the differential biosynthesis of heparin versus heparan sulfate; probably cellular factors in heparin-producing cells are also responsible for the differential biosynthesis of these two proteoglycans. DISCUSSIONWe have unexpectedly found in cells from a tissue that does not synthesize heparin a very abundant message encoding a protein that has 95% sequence identity with the putative heparinN-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase. The protein has biochemical characteristics very similar to the mastocytoma and not the rat liver N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (15Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z.

They further hypothesized that endogenous polycations in mast cells, probably polypeptides, are required for theN-acetylglucosaminyl N-deacetylase activityin vivo.We differ in the interpretation of the above results. We believe that the purified enzyme from mastocytoma (17Cheung W.F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), in a manner analogous to the purified one from rat liver (27Brandan E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2417-2422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has lost during the many purification steps its ability to N-deacetylateN-acetylglucosamine of heparin or heparan sulfate in vitro; in the presence of polycations, this activity is regained in assays in vitro. When a soluble chimera of the heparin/heparan sulfate N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase of either MST cells or rat liver with protein A is expressed and secreted, thus allowing a rapid, one-step purification of the enzyme by its binding to IgG beads both proteins have both catalytic activities in assays in vitro without need of polycations (14Wei Z.

Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same result was obtained with the above described trachea cell-derived enzyme.The above results describing that bovine trachea-derived cells contain a N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, resembling the mastocytoma enzyme and not the rat liver enzyme, require a re-examination of the hypothesis that the mastocytoma enzyme is necessary for the synthesis of heparin and not heparan sulfate, whereas the liver one is required for heparan sulfate and not heparin. It would appear more likely that the decision as to whether a cell synthesizes heparin or heparan sulfate may depend on the presence of specific heparin or heparan sulfate precursor intermediates and additional cellular factors rather than solely specificN-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase. Among such factors may be the availability of PAPS (28Conrad H.E. Heparin Binding Proteins. Academic Press, New York1998: 175-176Google Scholar) or nucleotide sugars in the Golgi lumen; the Km of the different acceptors for these nucleotide derivatives and other possible effectors that are not yet characterized. Because current approaches in vitrowith non-physiological substrates such as K5 are subject to equivocal interpretation, definite answers to this important question will have to await gene disruption studies of these enzymes and replacement of one enzyme for the other in different cells.We have recently shown that availability of nucleotide sugars in the Golgi lumen greatly influences which glycosaminoglycan chains are synthesized; thus, in MDCK cells having limited availability of UDP-galactose in the Golgi lumen, the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proceeds normally, whereas that of keratan sulfate is abolished (29Toma L. Pinhal M.A. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3897-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We had previously shown in biochemical and genetic experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae that the nucleotide sugar/nucleoside phosphate antiporter system, which provides in the Golgi lumen substrates for the biosynthesis of oligosaccharides, plays a regulatory role in determining which macromolecules are synthesized within the lumen (30Abeijon C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The previous description of such an antiporter system in mammalian Golgi membranes (32Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the above results with MDCK cells (29Toma L. Pinhal M.A. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3897-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that such an antiporter system plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of either heparin or heparan sulfate. Furthermore, in the above mutant MDCK cells, chondroitin 4-sulfate became hypersulfated in the 6-O-position (29Toma L. Pinhal M.A. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3897-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), perhaps because of a lack of absolute substrate specificity of a putative keratan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase.In conclusion, we believe that it is unlikely that the heparin/heparan sulfate N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase per se is solely responsible for the selective synthesis of heparin or heparan sulfate and that cellular factors including availability of substrates in the Golgi lumen may also play important roles in the differential synthesis of the above proteoglycan.

In conclusion, we believe that it is unlikely that the heparin/heparan sulfate N-acetylglucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase per se is solely responsible for the selective synthesis of heparin or heparan sulfate and that cellular factors including availability of substrates in the Golgi lumen may also play important roles in the differential synthesis of the above proteoglycan.

https://openalex.org/W1981914545,"Staphylokinase (Sak) forms an inactive 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasminogen which requires both conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and hydrolysis of the Lys10-Lys11 peptide bond of Sak to become a potent plasminogen activator (Schlott, B., Guhrs, K.-H., Hartmann, M., Rocker, A., and Collen, D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 6067–6072). Exposure of a positively charged NH2-terminal amino acid after hydrolysis of Sak is a major determinant of the plasminogen-activating potential, but in itself is neither necessary nor sufficient. Here, the structural motifs of the NH2-terminal region Lys11-Gly-Asp-Asp-Ala-Ser16-Tyr-Phe-Glu of processed Sak, required for plasminogen activating potential, were studied by deletion and substitution mutagenesis.Expression in Escherichia coli of variants with deletion of 11, 14, 15, or 16 NH2-terminal amino acids yielded correctly processed but inactive molecules. Expression of their homologues with the NH2-terminal amino acid substituted with Lys-generated derivatives from which the NH2-terminal initiation Met was no longer removed, yielding inactive (≤ 10%) Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K, active (>50%) Sak42DΔN14(M),A15K and Sak42DΔN15(M),S16K, and inactive Sak42DΔN16(M),Y17K. Lys variants without NH2-terminal Met, generated from fusion proteins in which a His6 tag and a factor Xa recognition sequence were linked to the NH2 terminus of the Sak variants, were indistinguishable from their NH2-terminal Met-containing counterparts. All variants studied had intact affinities for plasminogen as measured by biospecific interaction analysis. The activity of Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K could be restored by additional substitution of both Asp13 and Asp14 with Asn, yielding active Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K, D13N, D14N, whereas substitution in Sak42DΔN16(M),Y17K of Phe18 and Glu19 with Asn yielded inactive Sak42DΔN16(M),Y17K,F18N,E19N.These data, in combination with the recent finding that the 20 NH2-terminal amino acids of Sak lack secondary structure, suggest that the NH2-terminal region of Sak is not required for binding to plasmin/plasminogen, but that a positively charged amino acid in the ultimate or penultimate NH2-terminal position corresponding to amino acids 11–16 of this flexible region participates in the reconfiguration of the active site of the plasmin molecule to endow it with plasminogen-activating potential. Staphylokinase (Sak) forms an inactive 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasminogen which requires both conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and hydrolysis of the Lys10-Lys11 peptide bond of Sak to become a potent plasminogen activator (Schlott, B., Guhrs, K.-H., Hartmann, M., Rocker, A., and Collen, D.

These data, in combination with the recent finding that the 20 NH2-terminal amino acids of Sak lack secondary structure, suggest that the NH2-terminal region of Sak is not required for binding to plasmin/plasminogen, but that a positively charged amino acid in the ultimate or penultimate NH2-terminal position corresponding to amino acids 11–16 of this flexible region participates in the reconfiguration of the active site of the plasmin molecule to endow it with plasminogen-activating potential.

Sak is not an enzyme, but a cofactor that initially forms an inactive 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasminogen, which requires both conversion to Sak-plasmin to expose an active site in plasmin and NH2-terminal processing of Sak to reconfigure this active site for the specific cleavage of single chain plasminogen into active two-chain plasmin (9Schlott B. Guhrs K.-H. Hartmann M. Rocker A. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6067-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The exposure of a positively charged amino acid at the new NH2 terminus after cleavage of the Lys10-Lys11 (P1-P1′) peptide bond is a critical step to unveil the plasminogen-activating potential of Sak, but additional structural motifs may be necessary to endow the Sak molecule with plasminogen-activating potential (9Schlott B. Guhrs K.-H. Hartmann M. Rocker A. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6067-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of Sak was recently elucidated by crystallography and x-ray diffraction analysis (10Rabijns A. De Bondt H.L. De Ranter C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the secondary structure independently by NMR (11Ohlenschläger O. Ramachandran R. Flemming J. Gührs K.-H. Schlott B. Brown L.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In both studies, no secondary structure could be assigned to the NH2-terminal 20 amino acids, which suggests that the NH2-terminal region may be rather flexible. In the present study, the NH2-terminal structural elements of staphylokinase required to confer plasminogen-activator specificity to its complex with plasmin were studied by deletion and substitution of amino acids extending from Gly12 to Glu19. These deletion mutants lack plasminogen-activating potential but (some of them) can be functionally rescued by substituting their NH2-terminal amino acid with a positively charged Lys, notwithstanding the fact that theEscherichia coli expression system no longer removed the NH2-terminal initiation Met from the Lys-containing variants. The shortest variant with intact plasminogen-activating potential was found to be Sak42DΔN15(M),S16K. Enzymes and reagents for gene construction experiments were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany), sequenase was from Amersham (Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig, Germany), and Ni-NTA resin from Quiagene (Hilden, Germany). Factor Xa protease was supplied by New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). Other reagents were of the highest quality commonly available. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a DNA/RNA-synthesizer model 394 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Semiphosphorylated linker cassettes were obtained by chemical phosphorylation of the respective oligonucleotides at the end of the synthesis (Glen Research, Sterling, VA). Native human plasminogen was purified from human plasma according to Deutsch and Mertz (12Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). The synthetic plasmin substrate S-2251 was purchased from Chromogenix (Essen, Germany). The variants of Sak42D (6Behnke D. Gerlach D. Mol. Gen.

The PCR fragments were trimmed at the 5′-end by NdeI and at the 3′-end by HindIII, respectively, and cloned into the unique NdeI andHindIII sites of pMEX602Sak42D replacing the wild type sak42D gene as described elsewhere (14Gase A.

The nucleotide boxes covering the coding sequence from the NdeI site to the MluI site in the acceptor plasmid pMEXsak42D(Δ5–13) (9Schlott B. Guhrs K.-H. Hartmann M. Rocker A. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6067-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and from the NdeI site to the SfuI site in the expression plasmid of variant Sak42DΔN14(M),A15K, respectively, were substituted by the linker pairs L1/L2, L3/L4 and L5/L6, respectively. By this manipulation, a metal ion binding site (His6-tag) followed by the substrate recognition site of factor Xa was generated in front of the truncated Sak42D variants. The variants were obtained by expression of the proteins, and cleavage with factor Xa. Briefly, cell extracts prepared by sonication of E. coli TG1 cells transformed with the appropriate expression plasmids were cleared by centrifugation (20,000 rpm for 1 h) and applied to a Ni-NTA column (4 ml of resin/200 ml of cell culture volume). Bound proteins were eluted with 0.25 m imidazole and dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2. The dialyzed eluate from 200 ml of culture volume was treated with 60 μl of factor Xa solution for 9 h at 37 °C. The separated NH2-terminal part and uncleaved material were removed by passage through a Ni-NTA column. The flow-through was concentrated by precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 at 85% saturation, and the redissolved material was further purified using a Superdex 75 HR 16/60TM column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of all purified Sak42D variants were determined on the Applied Biosystems model 476A (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For the Sak species generated in equimolar (4 μm) mixtures with plasminogen after 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, high resolution electrophoresis was carried out with the Mini-Protean II system (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) using 16% T (total acrylamide), 3% C (cross-linking agent) gels in the discontinuous Tris-Tricine buffer system according to Schagger and von Jagow (15Schagger H. von Jagow E. Adv. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Samples were applied to the gels after reduction by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in the presence of 1% SDS and 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol. Following gel separation, the proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) and then subjected to amino acid sequencing. Amidolytic activity was quantitated with the chromogenic plasmin substrate S-2251 (1 mm final concentration) and monitored at 405 nm for up to 12 min using a Spectramax 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Plasminogen (3.6 μm final concentration) was incubated with the Sak moieties (4 μm final concentration) at 37 °C in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.01% Tween 80 (activation buffer). Samples were withdrawn at 2-min intervals and diluted 40-fold in buffer containing chromogenic substrate S-2251, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm (ΔA405) was recorded. The activation of plasminogen (1.5 μmfinal concentration) by Sak42D moieties (5 nm final concentration) was assayed at 37 °C in activation buffer. At different time intervals up to 30 min, generated plasmin was measured with the S-2251 substrate. Sak42D and Sak42DΔN14(M),A15K were also evaluated at lower temperatures to detect differences in activation energies. The kinetic constants of plasminogen activation by plasmin-Sak complexes were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Therefore, equimolar mixtures of Sak42D variants and freshly prepared plasminogen were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in activation buffer containing 25% glycerol (v/v) and kept on ice. These preformed activator complexes (10–40 nm final concentration) were then mixed with plasminogen (0.25–10 μm final concentration), and generated plasmin was measured at 37 °C from the change in absorbance at 405 nm with S-2251. Accurate Lineweaver-Burk plots could not be constructed with variants displaying catalytic efficiencies <20% of that of wild type. For these variants, catalytic efficiencies were determined from the apparent second order rate constant at a plasminogen concentration of 5 μm. Association rate constants (ka) and dissociation rate constants (kd) for the interaction between Glu-Plg or rPlg(S741A) and the Sak variants were determined by real-time biospecific interaction analysis using the BIAcore instrument (Biacore Inc) (16Jönsson U. Malmqvist M. Adv. Biosensors. 1992; 2: 291-336Google Scholar). Glu-Plg or rPlg(S741A) were immobilized on the surface of sensor chip CM5 using the amine coupling kit (Biacore Inc), as recommended by the manufacturer. Immobilization was performed from protein solutions at 10 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at a flow of 5 μl/min for 6 min. The Sak42D variants were injected in solution over the sensor. The concentration of free analyte was kept constant by maintaining a continuous flow of solution at 20 °C past the sensor surface. At least three concentrations of each analyte (25–100 nm or 2–6 μm) in 10 mm Hepes, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.2, were injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 2 min in the association phase. After equilibrium was reached, sample was replaced by buffer, also at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 2 min. After each cycle, the surface of the sensor chip was regenerated by injection of 10 μl of 5 mm HCl. Association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants were derived from the observed response curves (resonance/time) as described in detail in the Biaevaluation 2.0 Software Handbook (Pharmacia Biosensor AB). The Sak42D variants were purified from E. coli TG1 cells transformed with the respective plasmids with yields of 70–500 μg/liter culture volume. SDS-PAGE (data not shown) displayed single bands with electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to the extent of NH2-terminal deletion. Homogeneity of the purified proteins was further revealed by NH2-terminal sequencing as illustrated in TableII. The mutants Sak42DΔN11, Sak42DΔN14, and Sak42DΔN15, like the wild type Sak42D, were correctly processed in the E. coli TG1 expression system with removal of the NH2-terminal initiation Met. The variants with Lys substitution in the NH2-terminal position were expressed with a Met residue at the NH2 terminus, added to initiate expression in E. coli, but which was not removed when followed by Lys.Table IINH2-terminal processing, catalytic parameters of plasminogen activation, and plasminogen binding of Sak variantsVariantNH2-terminal sequenceaThe sequences are aligned with Pro20 and mutagenized amino acids are in bold face.Rate of plg activationK mkcatCatalytic efficiencyStarting materialProcessed material% of Sak42Dμms−1μm−1 × s−1Sak42DSSSFDKGKYKKGDDASYFEPKGDDASYFEP1002.40.10.080Sak42DΔN11GDDASYFEPGDDASYFEP0.0NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.0.002Sak42DΔN11(M),G12KMKDDASYFEPMKDDASYFEP4.8NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.0.006Sak42DΔN11,G12KKDDASYFEPKDDASYFEP0.010Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K,D13IMKIDASYFEPMKIDASYFEP0.0NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.0.006Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K,D13N,D14NMKNNASYFEPMKNNASYFEP462.30.10.054NNASYFEPSak42DΔN14ASYFEPASYFEP0.0NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.0.002Sak42DΔN14(M),A15KMKSYFEPMKSYFEP96231.40.059Sak42DΔN14,A15KKSYFEPKSYFEP845.10.20.044Sak42DΔN15SYFEPSYFEP0.0NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.0.005Sak42DΔN15(M),S16KMKYFEPMKYFEP160442.40.055Sak42DΔN16(M),Y17KMKFEPMKFEP0.0NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.0.008Sak42DΔN16,Y17KKFEPKFEP0.0NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.0.010Sak42DΔN16(M)Y17K,F18AMKAEPNDbSequence not detectable because of degradation of the Sak moiety in the complex.0.0NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.<0.001Sak42DΔN16(M)Y17K,F18N,E19NMKNNPMKNNP0.0NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.NDcND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.<0.001a The sequences are aligned with Pro20 and mutagenized amino acids are in bold face.b Sequence not detectable because of degradation of the Sak moiety in the complex.c ND, no Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6067-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), amidolytic activity toward the synthetic plasmin substrate S-2251 was detected in all equimolar mixtures of plasminogen with the Sak variants (not shown). Mutants whose complexes with plasmin did not efficiently activate plasminogen, expressed up to 3-fold higher amidolytic activity than complexes of wild type Sak42D with plasmin. This was not unexpected in view of the known higher specific activity of the active site of plasmin toward the chromogenic substrate, as compared with that of the active site of the plasminogen-activating plasmin·Sak complex (9Schlott B. Guhrs K.-H. Hartmann M. Rocker A. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6067-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Catalytic amounts of Sak42D induced activation of plasminogen to plasmin with a lag phase of approximately 5 min, reaching a maximal rate (determined from the slope at the inflection point of these curves) after 5–15 min. The results obtained with active complexes are illustrated in Fig.1. As described previously (9Schlott B. Guhrs K.-H. Hartmann M. Rocker A. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6067-6072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the Sak42DΔN10(M) and Sak42Dproc variants displayed activation curves similar to those of wild type Sak42D (not shown). Sak 42DΔN14 and Sak42DΔN15 were inactive but could be rescued by replacing their respective NH2-terminal amino acid by a lysine residue, yielding functionally active Sak42DΔN14(M),A15K and Sak42DΔN15(M),S16K (Fig. 1). Sak42DΔN11 was also inactive but could only be rescued by substitution of Gly12 with Lys and in addition of both Asp13 and Asp14 with Asn, yielding functionally inactive Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K and Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K,D13I (not shown) but active Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K,D13N,D14N (Fig. 1). The Sak variant obtained by deleting 16 NH2-terminal amino acids and replacing Tyr17 by Lys, yielding Sak42DΔN16(M),Y17K was inactive. Additional replacement of residues Phe18 and/or Glu19, yielding mutants Sak42DΔN16(M),Y17K,F18A and Sak42DΔN16(M),Y17K,F18N,E19N, did not restore plasminogen-activating capacity (not shown). Complexes of plasmin with functionally active Sak variants, identified as described above, activated plasminogen following Michaelis-Menten kinetics with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) ranging between 0.044 and 0.059 μm−1·s−1, as determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots (Table II). Catalytic rate constants (kcat) and Michaelis constants (Km) comparable with those of wild type Sak42D were obtained for Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K,D13N,D14N and Sak42DΔN14,A15K, whereas Sak42DΔN14(M),A15K and Sak42DΔN15(M),S16K had 10-fold higher kcat and Km, but similar kcat/Km. Sak42DΔN16(M),Y17K and Sak42DΔN16,Y17K had only approximately 10% of the catalytic efficiency of Sak42D. To evaluate the influence of the unprocessed NH2-terminal Met residues in the variants with NH2-terminal Lys substitutions, “methionine-free” Sak42DΔN11,G12K, Sak42DΔN14,A15K, and Sak42DΔN16,Y17K variants were prepared. Table II demonstrates that Sak42DΔN14,A15K still activated plasminogen, whereas the other variants, like their Met-containing counterparts, were inactive. To evaluate possible differences in activation energies for the induction of plasminogen-activating potential between unprocessed wild type Sak42D and the “preprocessed” deletion mutant with rescued plasminogen-activating potential, Sak42DΔN14(M),A15K, the effect of temperature on the activation of plasminogen by catalytic amounts of Sak variant were studied (Fig.2). At 37 °C, plasmin generation progressed at similar rates, whereas at 10 °C no plasmin generation occurred within 30 min. At intermediate temperatures (15–25 °C), plasmin generation proceeded significantly faster with Sak42DΔN14(M),A15K than with wild type Sak42D. The association and dissociation rate constants (ka and kd) and the apparent affinity equilibrium constants (Ka) for binding of Sak42D moieties to native Glu-Plg in the presence of excess plasmin inhibitor or to rPlg(S741A) are summarized in Table III. The ka, kd, andKa values of all Sak42D variants studied were very similar to those of wild type Sak42D. The affinity constants for binding to native Glu-Plg were approximately 1000-fold lower than those for binding to rPlg(S741A) as a result of 100-fold higherka and 10-fold lower kd values.Table IIIPlasminogen binding of Sak variantsVariantBinding to Glu plasminogenBinding to recombinant plasminogen (S741A)ka (×103)kd (× 10−3)Ka (× 106)ka (× 103)kd (× 10−3)Ka (× 106)M−1 · s−1s−1m−1M−1 · s−1s−1m−1Sak42D9.6160.6010003.3300Sak42DΔN111.75.80.309802.9320Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K11150.7510003.2320Sak42DΔN11,G12K18220.8010003.6280Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K,D13I8.3150.555202.9180Sak42DΔN11(M),G12K,D13N,D14N14190.7412003.9300Sak42DΔN148.3110.758002.5320Sak42DΔN14(M),A15K5.7140.416604.1160Sak42DΔN14,A15K11220.516004.0150Sak42DΔN1512140.886202.6240Sak42DΔN15(M),S16K4.5150.305402.7200Sak42DΔN16(M),Y17K4.6220.2110503.7280Sak42DΔN16,Y17K9.4160.597503.1240Sak42DΔN16(M)Y17K,F18A7.0370.197503.4220Sak42DΔN16(M)Y17K,F18N,E19N8.6430.2011005.8190 Open table in a new tab Sak is a highly fibrin-selective and potent agent for thrombolytic therapy in patients with thromboembolic arterial disease (3Vanderschueren S.

Circulation. 1995; 92: 2050-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fibrin selectivity is due to the fact that Sak has a low affinity for plasminogen in plasma, but a high affinity for plasminogen or for traces of plasmin associated with fibrin clot (17Sacharov D.V. Lijnen H.R. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27912-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the plasminogen·Sak complex is inactive and both conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and NH2-terminal processing of Sak to Sak42ΔN10 by hydrolysis of the Lys10-Lys11peptide bond are required to generate active plasmin·Sak′ complex at the fibrin surface, whereas removal of Lys11 results in loss of plasminogen-activating potential. The aim of the present study was to characterize structural motifs in the NH2-terminal region of Sak possibly required for binding to plasminogen and for reconfiguration of the active site of plasmin in the plasmin·Sak complex from that of fibrin degrading plasmin to that of plasminogen-activating plasmin·Sak complex. This was studied by evaluation of the NH2-terminal processing, the catalytic efficiency for plasminogen activation, and the binding affinity to insolubilized plasminogen of deletion/substitution variants of the Lys11-Gly-Asp-Asp-Ala-Ser16-Tyr-Phe-Glu region of Sak. The results indicate that removal of K, KGDD, or KGDDA, yielding Sak42DΔN11, Sak42DΔN14, or Sak42DΔN15, did not affect the association and dissociation rate constants of the binding of these variants to plasminogen, but reduced the catalytic efficiency for plasminogen activation by more than 1 order of magnitude. Substitution of the NH2-terminal amino acids by Lys in Sak42DΔN14 or Sak42DΔN15, yielding Sak42DΔN14,A15K and Sak42DΔN15,S16K, rescued the plasminogen-activating activity, whereas Sak42DΔN16,Y17K and Sak42DΔN11,G12K were inactive. Further substitution of Asp13 and Asp14 in Sak42DΔN11,G12K with Asn, yielding Sak42DΔN11,G12K,D13N,D14N, rescued the plasminogen-activating activity, but a similar substitution of Phe18 and Glu19 in Sak42DΔN16,Y17K with Asn, yielding Sak42DΔN16,Y17K,F18N,E19N did not endow the latter variant with plasminogen-activating potential. Finally, all variants studied had similar association and dissociation rate constants for low affinity binding to insolubilized native plasminogen and for high affinity binding to insolubilized active site-substituted recombinant plasminogen. No differences in plasminogen-activating potency were observed between Lys-substituted deletion variants with or without the presence of the NH2-terminal initiation Met. Nevertheless, although the catalytic efficiencies of Sak42DΔN14(M), A15K and Sak42DΔN15(M),S16K were similar to that of wild type Sak42D, they had 10- to 20-fold higher kcat andKm values. The mechanism underlying these differences remains unclear. It is possible that the exposed NH2-terminal Lys primarily influences the active site configuration via its ε-amino group and that masking of the NH2-terminal α-amino group might yield a more efficient active center. These findings indicate: 1) that binding to plasmin/plasminogen and reconfiguration of the active site of plasmin are mediated by different structures in the Sak molecule; 2) that a positive amino acid in the NH2-terminal position of Sak, in the region corresponding to positions 11–16 is required for reconfiguration of the active site of plasmin; and 3) that one or two negatively charged amino acids following the positive NH2-terminal amino acid prevent reconfiguration of the active site of plasmin. The variant Sak42DΔN16,Y17K marks the limit for rescuing, by introduction of a Lys at the NH2 terminus, the plasminogen-activating potency of NH2-terminal trimmed Sak molecules. This finding is in agreement with the recent finding (10Rabijns A. De Bondt H.L. De Ranter C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,11Ohlenschläger O. Ramachandran R. Flemming J. Gührs K.-H. Schlott B. Brown L.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that Sak lacks secondary structure in the region spanning the first 20 NH2-terminal amino acids. This region may have a flexible conformation located at the surface of Sak, which after hydrolysis and exposure of the positively charged amino acid may interact with the active site of plasmin to reconfigure its catalytic specificity, converting it from a fibrin-degrading to a plasminogen-activating proteinase. As reported previously, NH2-terminal processing of wild type Sak42D does not appear to be the rate-limiting step in plasminogen activation by Sak at 37 °C (18Ueshima S. Silence K. Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consequently, no differences in activation efficiency were found at 37 °C between wild type Sak42D, which needs to be processed NH2-terminally, and the “preprocessed” deletion variants. However, at lower temperatures, activation of plasminogen with catalytic amounts of Sak42DΔN14(M),A15K proceeded more rapidly compared with that of wild type Sak42D. This finding suggests that the activation energy of the processing of Sak42D is higher than that of the reconfiguration of the active site. The Lys residue unmasked by cleaving off the NH2-terminal peptide from Sak42D may be directly involved in the reconfiguration of the active site of plasmin. Recent data concerning the molecular interactions modulating the catalytic efficiency and specificity of serine proteinases support this assumption. Thus, a Lys residue in single-chain tissue plasminogen activator stabilizes the active conformation of this enzyme (19Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a series of proteases, Lys may substitute His as the general base in the catalytic triad (20Sliltaty S.N. Little J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

D., Tang, C., and Capaldi, R. A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 28341–28347). To assess the function of these interactions, we introduced random mutations in this region of the γ subunit (γ194–213). One mutation, γGlu-208 to Lys (γE208K), caused a temperature-sensitive defect in oxidative phosphorylation-dependent growth. ATP hydrolytic rates of the γE208K F0F1 enzyme became increasingly uncoupled from H+ pumping above 28 °C. In contrast, Arrhenius plot of steady-state ATP hydrolysis of the mutant enzyme was linear from 20 to 50 °C. Analysis of this plot revealed a significant increase in the activation energy of the catalytic transition state to a value very similar to soluble, ε subunit-inhibited F1 and suggested that the mutation blocked normal release of ε inhibition of ATP hydrolytic activity upon binding of F1 to F0. The difference in temperature dependence suggested that the γE208K mutation perturbed release of inhibition via a different mechanism than it did energy coupling. Suppressor mutations in the polar loop of subunitc restored ATP-dependent H+ pumping and transition state thermodynamic parameters close to wild-type values indicating that interactions between γ and c subunits mediate release of ε inhibition and communication of coupling information.

F0F1-ATP synthases are found embedded in the inner membrane of mitochondria, the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, and the plasma membrane of eubacteria, and they harness the flow of protons down an electrochemical gradient to drive oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation (for reviews, see Refs. 1Senior A.E.

In Escherichia coli, the membranous F0 moiety contains three subunits, a, b, and c, in a molar ratio of 1:2:9–12, and the soluble F1 moiety contains five subunits, α, β, γ, δ, and ε, in a molar ratio of 3:3:1:1:1. Current models predict that H+ translocation in F0 and catalysis in F1 are linked via a rotational mechanism (6Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Junge W. Lill H.

Nature. 1998; 391: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In this model, the subunits are organized into “rotor” and “stator” elements. The rotor contains at least the γ-ε dimer from F1 and possibly the subunitc oligomer from F0 (6Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the stator contains the α3β3 hexamer and δ from F1 and subunits a and b from F0. In the presence of an electrochemical gradient of protons, protons are carried through F0 in a manner that generates a torque on the rotor (9Elston T. Wang H. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In turn, the torque drives cooperative ATP synthesis with all three catalytic sites participating (reviewed in Refs. 7Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and 8Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 263: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (443) Google Scholar). There is little question that a rotary mechanism operates in the catalytic sector. The high resolution structure of the bovine mitochondrial F1 (10Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) confirmed that alternating α and β subunits are arranged in a hexameric ring and revealed that the amino and carboxyl termini of the γ subunit form an α-helical coiled-coil that projects into the α3β3hexamer. A unique face of the γ subunit imposes an asymmetry on the β subunits and the catalytic sites. This asymmetry is necessary for cooperative catalytic turnover as the α3β3hexamer is symmetric (11Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G.W. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika K. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Structure. 1997; 5: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and has no site-site cooperativity (12Kaibara C. Matsui T. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2433-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in the absence of the γ subunit. The direct observation of ATP hydrolysis-dependent rotation of the γ subunit relative to the α3β3 hexamer demonstrated that rotation is a mechanistic feature of cooperative catalysis (13Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). A model of the reaction pathway (14Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12961-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggests that the three different conformations of each β subunit observed in the crystal structure represent the major ground states that each site passes through during a catalytic cycle. As the γ subunit rotates, it drives each of the three sites through its cycle offset from the others by 120°, and specific conformational information is transmitted between the γ and β subunits which is critical for energy coupling (15Al-Shawi M.K.

Although the x-ray crystallographic structure provided a great deal of information about the catalytic sector of the enzyme, it did not contain the part of the rotor that connects catalysis to transport. Electron density was missing for the middle two-thirds of the γ subunit and the entire ε subunit (in E. coli nomenclature; this subunit is called δ in the mitochondrial complex). Nevertheless, solution structures of isolated E. coli ε and csubunits have been obtained by NMR (17Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H.

Situated in the middle of the carboxyl-terminal helix within the membrane bilayer lies cAsp-61, a conserved carboxylic acid believed to be directly involved in proton transport. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide modification of cAsp-61 blocks both H+ transport and ATP hydrolysis (21Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12167-12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The loop region is exposed to the cytoplasm and has been implicated in F1binding in a manner that is important for energy coupling (22Mosher M.E. White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first found a functional interaction between F0 and F1 by isolating a mutation in the polar loop of subunit c, cQ42E, that uncoupled the enzyme. This notion was confirmed when second-site mutations were identified in the ε subunit (εE31G, V, and K) which suppressed the deleterious effects of cQ42E (27Zhang Y. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They later found that εE31C can be induced to form disulfides with Cys replacements in subunit c at positions 40, 42, and 43 (28Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cys replacements of almost the same residues, 42, 43, and 44, also formed disulfides with γY205C (29Watts S.D. Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Watts et al. (29Watts S.D. Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

These cross-links had little effect on ATP hydrolysis, reinforcing the notion that ε subunit is a part of the rotor. As one might expect, εGlu-31, εHis-38, and εThr-43 are on the same side of a 10-stranded β-barrel created by the amino-terminal half of the subunit (20Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The β-barrel also contains a region that has been suggested to impose partial inhibition of ATPase activity in the soluble F1 complex (ε59–70 as suggested by Xiong and Vik (30Xiong H. Vik S.B. J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This inhibition is released upon binding of F1 to F0 (15Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol.

The results described above suggest a critical site of interaction between γ, ε, and c subunits. To assess the functional role of the interactions at the γ-ε-c interface, we screened random mutations in the region of the γ subunit near γTyr-205. We describe here the effects of a particularly interesting mutation, the replacement of γGlu-208 with Lys. Thermodynamically, the mutant F0F1 enzyme acted like F1 inhibited by ε subunit but also had a temperature-sensitive defect in oxidative phosphorylation and energy coupling. The effects of the γE208K 1The abbreviations used are: γE208KγGlu-208 replaced by Lys (all other amino acid residues are listed by the subunit, single, or three letter amino acid designation, residue number, and if applicable, mutant replacement). mutation were suppressed by second-site mutations near the polar loop of subunitc but not by mutations in the ε subunit. These findings establish a functional relationship between the γ and csubunits and suggest that the interaction between these subunits mediates the release of ε inhibition and plays a role in the transmission of coupling information between catalysis and H+ transport. γGlu-208 replaced by Lys (all other amino acid residues are listed by the subunit, single, or three letter amino acid designation, residue number, and if applicable, mutant replacement). The expression plasmid, pACWU1.2 (33Kuo P.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), carries the eight structural genes for the F0F1complex and complements the unc operon-deleted E. coli strain, DK8 (bglR, thi-1,rel-1, HfrPO1, Δ(uncB-uncC)ilv::Tn10; Ref. 34Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assist mutagenesis and cloning, several subclones were used. pBγKS was derived from pBluescript II KS− (Stratagene) and contains the entireuncG (γ subunit gene) between KpnI andSpeI. pUεEX was derived from pUC18 and contains a portion of uncD (β subunit gene) and the entire uncC(ε subunit gene) between Eco47III and XbaI. pBH-RI was derived from pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) and contains most of uncB and all of uncE,F, and H (a, c,b, and δ subunit genes, respectively) betweenBamHI and EcoRI. Molecular biology procedures were performed according to manufacturers' instructions or as detailed by Sambrook et al. (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Boehringer Mannheim, Life Technologies, Inc., New England Biolabs, and Promega. A Stratagene Chameleon Kit was used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (36Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). “Dirty test tube” oligonucleotides were synthesized by Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR) using 97% fidelity. In other words, they were synthesized using 97% of the major base and 1% of the other three bases, thereby theoretically producing approximately one base change per oligonucleotide. The introduction of mutations and the absence of other changes was confirmed by DNA sequencing (37Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar) and phenotype. Strain DK8 harboring derivatives of pACWU1.2 was grown on supplemented minimal medium as described previously (38Takeyama M. Ihara K. Moriyama Y. Noumi T. Ida K. Tomiyoka N. Itai A. Maeda M. Futai M.

For determination of oxidative phosphorylation-dependent growth, 0.4% sodium succinate was used as a sole carbon source (38Takeyama M. Ihara K. Moriyama Y. Noumi T. Ida K. Tomiyoka N. Itai A. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21279-21284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare F0F1-containing membrane vesicles, strains were grown until mid-log in minimal medium containing 1.1% glucose at 37 °C, and membranes were isolated as described previously (40Futai M. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of soluble F1 was carried out using an epitope tag. The sequence encoding the Flag epitope (DYKDDDDK) was introduced at the 5′ end ofuncD (β subunit gene) in both pACWU1.2 and pACWU1.2/γE208K as described previously (33Kuo P.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). F1 was dissociated from 20 mg of membranes and precipitated with polyethylene glycol 8000 (42Duncan T.M. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4901-4907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The crude soluble F1 containing the Flag epitope was applied to a 1-ml anti-Flag M2 affinity column (Kodak), pre-washed, and packed as suggested by the manufacturer. The column was washed with 10 volumes of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 10% v/v glycerol, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 40 mm6-aminohexanoic acid, and 150 mm NaCl, at pH 7.4. Purified F1 complex was eluted with four sequential washes of 0.25 mg/ml Flag peptide (DYKDDDDK) in wash buffer containing 40 mm Na2SO4 instead of 150 mm NaCl. The yield was 0.5–1 mg of F1 and purity was judged to be >95% based on Coomassie staining of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Determination of F1 content in membrane preparations was performed by a quantitative immunoblot assay described previously (15Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purified F1 was used as a reference standard. In order to strip away the F1 moiety, 100 μg of membrane protein was added to 1 ml of a buffer containing 1 mm Tris, 10% v/v glycerol, and 0.5 mm EDTA and stirred at room temperature for 15 min. The F1-depleted membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 541,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the procedure was repeated. Reconstitution was carried out by adding a 2-fold excess of purified F1 to stripped membranes and incubating with stirring at 37 °C for 30 min. ATP hydrolysis rates and formation of an electrochemical gradient of protons were determined as described previously (15Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol.

For Arrhenius analysis, temperature dependence of ATPase activity was measured in buffers containing 50 mmHEPES-KOH, 10 mm ATP, and 5 mmMgSO4; the pH was adjusted to 7.5 at the appropriate temperature (15Al-Shawi M.K.

The concentration of free Mg2+ and Mg·ATP was calculated using the algorithm of Fabiato and Fabiato (45Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of the interactions between subunits at the F0-F1 interface, random mutations were introduced into a region of the E. coli γ subunit (residues 194–213) that was demonstrated by cross-linking of cysteine replacements to interact with the ε subunit in F1 and thec subunits in F0 (28Zhang Y.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Dirty test tube synthesis was employed to randomly introduce approximately one base change per oligonucleotide (see “Experimental Procedures”). These oligonucleotides were used as primers in a standard site-directed mutagenesis protocol, and the mutagenized DNA fragment was shotgun cloned into the unc operon carried on plasmid pACWU1.2 (33Kuo P.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mixture of plasmids was used to transform strain DK8, and the transformants were screened for oxidative phosphorylation-dependent growth with sodium succinate as a sole carbon source. Seven mutant strains were initially selected based on poor growth at 37 °C. One mutation in particular, γE208K, proved interesting because it caused a temperature-sensitive growth defect. The γE208K mutant grew to 60% of wild-type at 25 °C but only 3% at 37 °C (Table I). The γE208K mutation did not appear to disturb complex assembly because the content of F1 associated with the isolated membrane vesicles was not different from wild-type membranes (Table I). This observation argued that the mutation affected growth by perturbing the functionality of the complex and reduced the rate of coupled ATP synthesis.Table IEffect of the γE208K mutation on F0F1 characteristicsPreparationRange of F1 contentaRange of F1 associated with membrane preparations expressed as percent of total membrane protein.

Open table in a new tab To understand better the temperature-sensitivity of the γE208K mutant, we measured rates of ATP hydrolysis, ATP-driven H+ pumping, and NADH-driven H+ pumping over a range of temperatures from 7 to 40 °C. As seen in Fig.1 A, the rate of ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven H+ pumping of the mutant enzyme increased relative to wild type up to about 28 °C; however, above that temperature ATP hydrolysis continued to increase while ATP-driven H+ pumping decreased. The decreased H+ pumping was not due to a passive leak of protons because the γE208K enzyme maintained the same level of NADH-driven H+ pumping as wild type. Clearly, catalysis became uncoupled from transport. The proportionate rates of ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven H+pumping of the γE208K mutant enzyme became apparent in a plot of the ratio of relative ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven H+ pumping (Fig. 1 B). At temperatures up to 28 °C, the given rate of ATP hydrolysis generated the expected degree of ATP-driven H+ pumping for a coupled enzyme. Above 28 °C, the ratio of ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven H+ pumping increased dramatically indicating that catalysis and H+ transport became increasingly unlinked with rising temperature. If the γE208K mutation perturbed the γ-ε-c subunit interface and did not permanently alter F0 function, then F0 from the γE208K mutant complex should reconstitute with wild-type F1 to form a complex with wild-type characteristics. We stripped the F1 moiety from both γE208K and wild-type membranes (in both cases <1% of the original ATPase activity remained after stripping) and reconstituted each with either purified γE208K or wild-type F1. Indeed, wild-type F1 reconstituted with stripped γE208K membranes had the same level of ATP-driven H+ pumping as the wild-type F1 reconstituted with stripped wild-type membranes (TableII). As expected, H+ pumping by the γE208K F1 reconstituted with either stripped γE208K or wild-type membranes was considerably lower than the wild-type control. These results indicated that the defect in coupling was due to the γE208K amino acid change and not due to an irreversible defect in the assembly of the F0 sector.Table IIATP-dependent H+ pumping of F1-depleted membranes reconstituted with purified F1 at 37 °CMembrane preparationSource of purified F1γE208K F1Wild-type F1DK8/pACWU1.2% WTaThe 100% value was the extent of acridine orange quenching obtained from the stripped wild-type membrane reconstituted with wild-type F1.Stripped wild-type membranesbNADH-dependent H+ pumping at 37 °C for both wild-type and γE208K F1-depleted membranes was 7 and 9%, respectively, compared with unstripped wild-type membranes.47100Stripped γE208K membranesbNADH-dependent H+ pumping at 37 °C for both wild-type and γE208K F1-depleted membranes was 7 and 9%, respectively, compared with unstripped wild-type membranes.41101H+ pumping was determined from acridine orange fluorescence quenching monitored at 530 nm with excitation at 460 nm. 100 μg of membrane vesicle protein was suspended in 2 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, 300 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 μm valinomycin, and 1 μmacridine orange at pH 7.5, with vigorous mixing.

Transition state thermodynamic parameters of the ATP hydrolytic reaction previously have been shown to be highly sensitive to alterations in protein conformation and subunit-subunit interactions (14Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12961-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol.

Arrhenius analysis of steady-state ATP hydrolysis was performed inVmax conditions with an ATP-regenerating system and a protonophore to prevent back inhibition from build up of ADP or ΔμH+, respectively. From these data, it is apparent that the γE208K enzymes, whether as the membranous F0F1 or the soluble F1, have very similar temperature dependence to the wild-type F1 (Fig.2). From the Arrhenius plots, the transition state thermodynamics parameters were derived and are listed in TableIII. First, we note that both the wild-type and γE208K F1 were purified by means of a Flag epitope tag added to the amino terminus of the β subunit (33Kuo P.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Flag sequence did not alter the transition state structure, as the thermodynamic parameters of the tagged F1 were similar to those previously reported for “normal” F1 (15Al-Shawi M.K.

https://openalex.org/W2143424012,"Abstract d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli is a homotetrameric enzyme which is allosterically regulated by the end product of its pathway, l-serine. The enzyme binds 4 l-serine molecules at two interfaces formed by the noncovalent association of the regulatory domains. The two domains that comprise each interface are related by an approximately 180° axis of symmetry, and two serine molecules bind at each interface by forming a hydrogen bond network between the domains. A model has been proposed that suggests that serine functions by drawing adjacent domains together and that this in turn translates a conformational change to the active site. A tryptophan residue has been engineered into the helices flanking the regulatory interfaces that displays significant quenching in response to serine binding. Residues on the adjacent subunit appear to be primarily responsible for the tryptophan quenching and thus support the hypothesis that serine binding leads to an increase in the proximity between residues on neighboring subunits. Serine binding studies show that this quenching, as well as inhibition of enzymatic activity, are essentially complete when only two of the four serine binding sites are occupied. The requirement for only one serine per interface is consistent with the notion that the interface is formed by relatively rigid domains and that hydrogen bonding at only a single site is all that is required to substantially close the interface. The fluorescence quenching in response to l-serine binding generally correlates with enzymatic inhibition, but there appears to be a slight lag in inhibition relative to quenching at low serine concentrations. The observed fluorescence quenching of residues in the regulatory domains of d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase provide the first direct evidence for a conformational change in response to effector binding and provide a means to monitor the first step in the allosteric mechanism."
