https://openalex.org/W1976445088,"Investigations of phase-separated Langmuir-Blodgett films by atomic force microscopy reveal that on a scale of 30 to 200 micrometers, these images resemble those observed by fluorescence microscopy. Fine structures (less than 1 micrometer) within the stearic acid domains were observed, which cannot be seen by conventional optical microscopic techniques. By applying the force modulation technique, it was found that the elastic properties of the domains in the liquid condensed phase and grains observed within the liquid expanded phase were comparable. Small soft residues in the domains could also be detected. The influence of trace amounts of a fluorescence dye on the micromorphology of monolayers could be detected on transferred films."

https://openalex.org/W1990585159,"The diverse aftershock sequence of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake is inconsistent with conventional models of mainshock-aftershock interaction because the aftershocks do not accommodate mainshock-induced stress changes. Instead, the sense of slip of the aftershocks is consistent with failure in response to a nearly uniaxial stress field in which the maximum principal stress acts almost normal to the mainshock fault plane. This orientation implies that (i) stress drop in the mainshock was nearly complete, (ii) mainshock-induced decreases of fault strength helped were important in controlling the occurrence of aftershocks, and (iii) mainshock rupture was limited to those sections of the fault with preexisting shear stress available to drive fault slip."

https://openalex.org/W1986421822,"Evidence for five large earthquakes during the past five centuries along the San Andreas fault zone 70 kilometers northeast of Los Angeles, California, indicates that the average recurrence interval and the temporal variability are significantly smaller than previously thought. Rapid sedimentation during the past 5000 years in a 150-meter-wide structural depression has produced a greater than 21-meter-thick sequence of debris flow and stream deposits interbedded with more than 50 datable peat layers. Fault scarps, colluvial wedges, fissure infills, upward termination of ruptures, and tilted and folded deposits above listric faults provide evidence for large earthquakes that occurred in A.D. 1857, 1812, and about 1700, 1610, and 1470."
https://openalex.org/W1982657566,"Compressibilities of five silicate spinels, including gamma-Mg(2)SiO(4), gamma-Fe(2)SiO(4), Ni(2)SiO(4) and two ferromagnesian compositions, were determined on crystals positioned in the same high-pressure mount. Subjection of all crystals simultaneously to the same pressure revealed differences in compressibility that resulted from compositional differences. Ferromagnesian silicate spinels showed an anomalous 13 percent increase in bulk modulus with increasing iron content, from Mg(2)SiO(4) (184 gigapascals) to Fe(2)SiO(4) (207 gigapascals). This result suggests that ferrous iron and magnesium, which behave similarly under crustal conditions, are chemically more distinct at high pressures characteristic of the transition zone and lower mantle."

Many of these microorganisms can be assigned to present-day groups. This discovery of terrestrial, soft-bodied protists that can be referred to modern groups indicates that morphological evolution is very gradual in many protists and that both structural and probably functional stasis extend back at least to the Upper Triassic period."
https://openalex.org/W2006942842,"A diverse assemblage of algal stromatolites occurs in Devonian reef complexes of the Canning Basin, Western Australia. Some forms grew on fore-reef depositional slopes down to at least 45 meters below sea level and are believed to be products of deepwater nonskeletal algae. It is concluded that algal stromatolites in the stratigraphic record are not to be regarded as diagnostic evidence for deposition in very shallow water."
https://openalex.org/W1991861448,Jadeite (high-pressure sodium aluminum pyroxene) has been identified in a shock-phase assemblage of oligoclase. The shock assemblage consists of minute particles with high refractive indices that contain at least two phases: one (identified by x-ray) is a jadeite that is nearly pure NaAlSi(2)O(6); the other has the chemical composition of oligoclase minus jadeite and appears to be largely amorphous.
https://openalex.org/W2035732469,"Presently available data on the electrical conductivity of the uppermost lunar surface layers are in accord with the presence of dry, powdered rocks in which the dielectric loss tangent is frequency-independent over several decades of frequency. These powders have typical direct-current conductivity values of about 10(-13) to 10(-16) mhos per meter and dielectric constants of about 3.0, depending on the packing. Thus the surface layers of the moon are likely to have an extremely low electrical conductivity. At high frequencies normal dielectric losses lead to much higher apparent conductivities that are frequency-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W2060138943,"A key hypothesis in the generalized theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics is the principle of microscopic time invariance as enunciated by Onsager in the 1930s. At the macroscopic level, Onsager's hypothesis is represented by a set of relations known as the Onsager reciprocal relations, which, when applied to isothermal, multicomponent diffusion, demand the symmetry of the phenomenological matrix that connects mass fluxes to chemical potential gradients. On the basis of experimentally determined diffusion coefficients and thermochemical data for the molten system CaO-Al(2)O(3)-SiO(2), the Onsager phenomenological coefficients have been computed, including an analysis of error. Within experimental uncertainty, the Onsager matrix is indeed symmetric."
