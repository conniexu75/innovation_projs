https://openalex.org/W2963083369,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, in which the clinical manifestations may be influenced by genetic and unknown environmental factors. Here we show that ALS-prone Sod1 transgenic (Sod1-Tg) mice have a pre-symptomatic, vivarium-dependent dysbiosis and altered metabolite configuration, coupled with an exacerbated disease under germ-free conditions or after treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. We correlate eleven distinct commensal bacteria at our vivarium with the severity of ALS in mice, and by their individual supplementation into antibiotic-treated Sod1-Tg mice we demonstrate that Akkermansia muciniphila (AM) ameliorates whereas Ruminococcus torques and Parabacteroides distasonis exacerbate the symptoms of ALS. Furthermore, Sod1-Tg mice that are administered AM are found to accumulate AM-associated nicotinamide in the central nervous system, and systemic supplementation of nicotinamide improves motor symptoms and gene expression patterns in the spinal cord of Sod1-Tg mice. In humans, we identify distinct microbiome and metabolite configurations-including reduced levels of nicotinamide systemically and in the cerebrospinal fluid-in a small preliminary study that compares patients with ALS with household controls. We suggest that environmentally driven microbiome-brain interactions may modulate ALS in mice, and we call for similar investigations in the human form of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2963985015,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovaries1, and is often accompanied by insulin resistance2. The mechanism of ovulatory dysfunction and insulin resistance in PCOS remains elusive, thus limiting the development of therapeutics. Improved metabolic health is associated with a relatively high microbiota gene content and increased microbial diversity3,4. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the gut microbiota and its metabolites on the regulation of PCOS-associated ovarian dysfunction and insulin resistance. Here, we report that Bacteroides vulgatus was markedly elevated in the gut microbiota of individuals with PCOS, accompanied by reduced glycodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid levels. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from women with PCOS or B. vulgatus-colonized recipient mice resulted in increased disruption of ovarian functions, insulin resistance, altered bile acid metabolism, reduced interleukin-22 secretion and infertility. Mechanistically, glycodeoxycholic acid induced intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cell IL-22 secretion through GATA binding protein 3, and IL-22 in turn improved the PCOS phenotype. This finding is consistent with the reduced levels of IL-22 in individuals with PCOS. This study suggests that modifying the gut microbiota, altering bile acid metabolism and/or increasing IL-22 levels may be of value for the treatment of PCOS."

https://openalex.org/W2963665804,"Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in neuronal and somatic cells. The wide range of clinical manifestations in NIID makes ante-mortem diagnosis difficult1-8, but skin biopsy enables its ante-mortem diagnosis9-12. The average onset age is 59.7 years among approximately 140 NIID cases consisting of mostly sporadic and several familial cases. By linkage mapping of a large NIID family with several affected members (Family 1), we identified a 58.1 Mb linked region at 1p22.1-q21.3 with a maximum logarithm of the odds score of 4.21. By long-read sequencing, we identified a GGC repeat expansion in the 5' region of NOTCH2NLC (Notch 2 N-terminal like C) in all affected family members. Furthermore, we found similar expansions in 8 unrelated families with NIID and 40 sporadic NIID cases. We observed abnormal anti-sense transcripts in fibroblasts specifically from patients but not unaffected individuals. This work shows that repeat expansion in human-specific NOTCH2NLC, a gene that evolved by segmental duplication, causes a human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2963531283,"The gut microbiome is emerging as a key regulator of several metabolic, immune and neuroendocrine pathways1,2. Gut microbiome deregulation has been implicated in major conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty acid liver disease and cancer3–6, but its precise role in aging remains to be elucidated. Here, we find that two different mouse models of progeria are characterized by intestinal dysbiosis with alterations that include an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, and a decrease in the abundance of Verrucomicrobia. Consistent with these findings, we found that human progeria patients also display intestinal dysbiosis and that long-lived humans (that is, centenarians) exhibit a substantial increase in Verrucomicrobia and a reduction in Proteobacteria. Fecal microbiota transplantation from wild-type mice enhanced healthspan and lifespan in both progeroid mouse models, and transplantation with the verrucomicrobia Akkermansia muciniphila was sufficient to exert beneficial effects. Moreover, metabolomic analysis of ileal content points to the restoration of secondary bile acids as a possible mechanism for the beneficial effects of reestablishing a healthy microbiome. Our results demonstrate that correction of the accelerated aging-associated intestinal dysbiosis is beneficial, suggesting the existence of a link between aging and the gut microbiota that provides a rationale for microbiome-based interventions against age-related diseases. Fecal microbiome transplantation or probiotic therapy with Akkermansia muciniphila extends the lifespan and improves the health status of progeroid mice, pointing to the importance of the gut microbiome in regulating lifespan and healthspan."

https://openalex.org/W2963629338,"Base editors use DNA-modifying enzymes targeted with a catalytically impaired CRISPR protein to precisely install point mutations. Here, we develop phage-assisted continuous evolution of base editors (BE–PACE) to improve their editing efficiency and target sequence compatibility. We used BE–PACE to evolve cytosine base editors (CBEs) that overcome target sequence context constraints of canonical CBEs. One evolved CBE, evoAPOBEC1-BE4max, is up to 26-fold more efficient at editing cytosine in the GC context, a disfavored context for wild-type APOBEC1 deaminase, while maintaining efficient editing in all other sequence contexts tested. Another evolved deaminase, evoFERNY, is 29% smaller than APOBEC1 and edits efficiently in all tested sequence contexts. We also evolved a CBE based on CDA1 deaminase with much higher editing efficiency at difficult target sites. Finally, we used data from evolved CBEs to illuminate the relationship between deaminase activity, base editing efficiency, editing window width and byproduct formation. These findings establish a system for rapid evolution of base editors and inform their use and improvement. Improved base editors are generated by continuous evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2963174936,"Cytokine dysregulation is a central driver of chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we sought to determine the characteristic cellular and cytokine polarization profile in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF). Using a combination of neural network-based representation learning algorithms, we identified an expanded T helper cell subset in patients with MS, characterized by the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4. This cellular signature, which includes expression of very late antigen 4 in peripheral blood, was also enriched in the central nervous system of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. In independent validation cohorts, we confirmed that this cell population is increased in patients with MS compared with other inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. Lastly, we also found the population to be reduced under effective disease-modifying therapy, suggesting that the identified T cell profile represents a specific therapeutic target in MS."

https://openalex.org/W2964133630,"Checkpoint inhibitors produce durable responses in numerous metastatic cancers, but immune-related adverse events (irAEs) complicate and limit their benefit. IrAEs can affect organ systems idiosyncratically; presentations range from mild and self-limited to fulminant and fatal. The molecular mechanisms underlying irAEs are poorly understood. Here, we report a fatal case of encephalitis arising during anti-programmed cell death receptor 1 therapy in a patient with metastatic melanoma. Histologic analyses revealed robust T cell infiltration and prominent programmed death ligand 1 expression. We identified 209 reported cases in global pharmacovigilance databases (across multiple cancer types) of encephalitis associated with checkpoint inhibitor regimens, with a 19% fatality rate. We performed further analyses from the index case and two additional cases to shed light on this recurrent and fulminant irAE. Spatial and multi-omic analyses pinpointed activated memory CD4+ T cells as highly enriched in the inflamed, affected region. We identified a highly oligoclonal T cell receptor repertoire, which we localized to activated memory cytotoxic (CD45RO+GZMB+Ki67+) CD4 cells. We also identified Epstein-Barr virus-specific T cell receptors and EBV+ lymphocytes in the affected region, which we speculate contributed to neural inflammation in the index case. Collectively, the three cases studied here identify CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as culprits of checkpoint inhibitor-associated immune encephalitis."
https://openalex.org/W2963986130,"The family of bacterial SidE enzymes catalyses phosphoribosyl-linked serine ubiquitination and promotes infectivity of Legionella pneumophila, a pathogenic bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease1-3. SidE enzymes share the genetic locus with the Legionella effector SidJ that spatiotemporally opposes the toxicity of these enzymes in yeast and mammalian cells, through a mechanism that is currently unknown4-6. Deletion of SidJ leads to a substantial defect in the growth of Legionella in both its natural hosts (amoebae) and in mouse macrophages4,5. Here we demonstrate that SidJ is a glutamylase that modifies the catalytic glutamate in the mono-ADP ribosyl transferase domain of the SdeA, thus blocking the ubiquitin ligase activity of SdeA. The glutamylation activity of SidJ requires interaction with the eukaryotic-specific co-factor calmodulin, and can be regulated by intracellular changes in Ca2+ concentrations. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of SidJ in complex with human apo-calmodulin revealed the architecture of this heterodimeric glutamylase. We show that, in cells infected with L. pneumophila, SidJ mediates the glutamylation of SidE enzymes on the surface of vacuoles that contain Legionella. We used quantitative proteomics to uncover multiple host proteins as putative targets of SidJ-mediated glutamylation. Our study reveals the mechanism by which SidE ligases are inhibited by a SidJ-calmodulin glutamylase, and opens avenues for exploring an understudied protein modification (glutamylation) in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2963761043,"Spatial structuring is important for the maintenance of natural ecological systems1,2. Many microbial communities, including the gut microbiome, display intricate spatial organization3-9. Mapping the biogeography of bacteria can shed light on interactions that underlie community functions10-12, but existing methods cannot accommodate the hundreds of species that are found in natural microbiomes13-17. Here we describe metagenomic plot sampling by sequencing (MaPS-seq), a culture-independent method to characterize the spatial organization of a microbiome at micrometer-scale resolution. Intact microbiome samples are immobilized in a gel matrix and cryofractured into particles. Neighboring microbial taxa in the particles are then identified by droplet-based encapsulation, barcoded 16S rRNA amplification and deep sequencing. Analysis of three regions of the mouse intestine revealed heterogeneous microbial distributions with positive and negative co-associations between specific taxa. We identified robust associations between Bacteroidales taxa in all gut compartments and showed that phylogenetically clustered local regions of bacteria were associated with a dietary perturbation. Spatial metagenomics could be used to study microbial biogeography in complex habitats."

https://openalex.org/W2962850299,"The bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila creates an intracellular niche permissive for its replication by extensively modulating host-cell functions using hundreds of effector proteins delivered by its Dot/Icm secretion system1. Among these, members of the SidE family (SidEs) regulate several cellular processes through a unique phosphoribosyl ubiquitination mechanism that bypasses the canonical ubiquitination machinery2-4. The activity of SidEs is regulated by another Dot/Icm effector known as SidJ5; however, the mechanism of this regulation is not completely understood6,7. Here we demonstrate that SidJ inhibits the activity of SidEs by inducing the covalent attachment of glutamate moieties to SdeA-a member of the SidE family-at E860, one of the catalytic residues that is required for the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity involved in ubiquitin activation2. This inhibition by SidJ is spatially restricted in host cells because its activity requires the eukaryote-specific protein calmodulin (CaM). We solved a structure of SidJ-CaM in complex with AMP and found that the ATP used in this reaction is cleaved at the α-phosphate position by SidJ, which-in the absence of glutamate or modifiable SdeA-undergoes self-AMPylation. Our results reveal a mechanism of regulation in bacterial pathogenicity in which a glutamylation reaction that inhibits the activity of virulence factors is activated by host-factor-dependent acyl-adenylation."
https://openalex.org/W2963869135,"Goal-directed navigation is thought to rely on the activity of head-direction cells, but how this activity guides moment-to-moment actions remains poorly understood. Here we characterize how heading neurons in the Drosophila central complex guide moment-to-moment navigational behavior. We establish an innate, heading-neuron-dependent, tethered navigational behavior where walking flies maintain a straight trajectory along a specific angular bearing for hundreds of body lengths. While flies perform this task, we use chemogenetics to transiently rotate their neural heading estimate and observe that the flies slow down and turn in a direction that aims to return the heading estimate to the angle it occupied before stimulation. These results support a working model in which the fly brain quantitatively compares an internal estimate of current heading with an internal goal heading and uses the sign and magnitude of the difference to determine which way to turn, how hard to turn and how fast to walk forward."
https://openalex.org/W2963444353,"The use of special quantum states to achieve sensitivities below the limits established by classically behaving states has enjoyed immense success since its inception. In bosonic interferometers, squeezed states, number states and cat states have been implemented on various platforms and have demonstrated improved measurement precision over interferometers based on coherent states. Another metrologically useful state is an equal superposition of two eigenstates with maximally different energies; this state ideally reaches the full interferometric sensitivity allowed by quantum mechanics. By leveraging improvements to our apparatus made primarily to reach higher operation fidelities in quantum information processing, we extend a technique to create number states up to $n=100$ and to generate superpositions of a harmonic oscillator ground state and a number state of the form $\textstyle{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}(\lvert 0\rangle+\lvert n\rangle)$ with $n$ up to 18 in the motion of a single trapped ion. While experimental imperfections prevent us from reaching the ideal Heisenberg limit, we observe enhanced sensitivity to changes in the oscillator frequency that initially increases linearly with $n$, with maximal value at $n=12$ where we observe 3.2(2) dB higher sensitivity compared to an ideal measurement on a coherent state with the same average occupation number. The quantum advantage from using number-state superpositions can be leveraged towards precision measurements on any harmonic oscillator system; here it enables us to track the average fractional frequency of oscillation of a single trapped ion to approximately 2.6 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ in 5 s. Such measurements should provide improved characterization of imperfections and noise on trapping potentials, which can lead to motional decoherence, a leading source of error in quantum information processing with trapped ions."
https://openalex.org/W2964313170,"Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF)-giving infants only breast-milk (and medications, oral rehydration salts and vitamins as needed) with no additional food or drink for their first six months of life-is one of the most effective strategies for preventing child mortality1-4. Despite these advantages, only 37% of infants under 6 months of age in Africa were exclusively breastfed in 20175, and the practice of EBF varies by population. Here, we present a fine-scale geospatial analysis of EBF prevalence and trends in 49 African countries from 2000-2017, providing policy-relevant administrative- and national-level estimates. Previous national-level analyses found that most countries will not meet the World Health Organization's Global Nutrition Target of 50% EBF prevalence by 20256. Our analyses show that even fewer will achieve this ambition in all subnational areas. Our estimates provide the ability to visualize subnational EBF variability and identify populations in need of additional breastfeeding support."
https://openalex.org/W2964102418,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes an acute and severe lower respiratory illness as well as vomiting, diarrhea, and renal failure. Because no licensed MERS-CoV vaccines are currently available, preventive and therapeutic measures are urgently needed. The surface spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV, which binds to the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), is considered as a major target for MERS-CoV vaccine development. Here, we designed recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus-based vaccines expressing the N-terminal domain (rAd/NTD) and receptor-binding domain (rAd/RBD) of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit and full-length Spike protein (rAd/Spike). We found that immunization with candidate vaccines via intranasal route induced S1-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against MERS spike pseudotyped virus. Especially, rAd/Spike induced the highest neutralizing antibody titer and the strongest cytokine-induced T cell responses among the three candidate vaccines. To compare the immune responses induced by different administration routes, rAd/Spike was administered via intranasal, sublingual, or intramuscular route. All these administration routes exhibited neutralizing effects in the serum. MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing IgA antibodies in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were only induced by intranasal and sublingual administration but not by intramuscular administration. Intranasal administration with rAd/Spike also created resident memory CD8 T cells in the airway and lung parenchyma. Taken together, our results showed that both the humoral and cellular immune responses are highly induced by rAd/Spike administration, suggesting that rAd/Spike may confer protection against MERS-CoV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2964115989,"Diabetes mellitus may lead to intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) is one of the major catabolic factors in extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and contributes to diabetic IVDD. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal protein family and is implicated in chronic inflammation. Here, we report that the expression of BRD4 and MMP-13 was elevated in diabetic nucleus pulposus tissues as well as in advanced glycation end products (AGEs)-treated NPCs; also, the regulatory effect of BRD4 on MMP-13 was studied. We found that MMP-13 was regulated by MAPK and NF-κB signaling as well as autophagy in AGEs-treated NPCs. Next, we explored the role of BRD4 in regulation of MAPK, NF-κB signaling, and autophagy. The results showed that BRD4 is the upstream regulator of all of these 3 factors, and inhibition of BRD4 may suppress MAPK and NF-κB signaling while activating autophagy in AGEs-treated NPCs. Finally, we demonstrated that BRD4 inhibition may suppress MMP-13 expression in diabetic NPCs in vitro as well as in vivo; meanwhile, it may preserve ECM in diabetic rats. Our study demonstrates that inhibition of BRD4 may suppress MAPK and NF-κB signaling and activate autophagy to suppress MMP-13 expression in diabetic IVDD, and diabetic IVDD may be compromised by BRD4 inhibitors.-Wang, J., Hu, J., Chen, X., Huang, C., Lin, J., Shao, Z., Gu, M., Wu, Y., Tian, N., Gao, W., Zhou, Y., Wang, X., Zhang, X. BRD4 inhibition regulates MAPK, NF-κB signals, and autophagy to suppress MMP-13 expression in diabetic intervertebral disc degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2963617470,"Recent evidence has raised in discussion the possibility that cannabidiol can act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor. Here we have used computational methods to study the modulation exerted by cannabidiol on the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the cannabinoid receptor type 1 and the possibility of direct receptor blockade. We propose a putative allosteric binding site that is located in the N-terminal region of receptor, partially overlapping the orthosteric binding site. Molecular dynamics simulations reveled a coordinated movement involving the outward rotation of helixes 1 and 2 and subsequent expansion of the orthosteric binding site upon cannabidiol binding. Finally, changes in the cytoplasmic region and high helix 8 mobility were related to impaired receptor internalization. Together, these results offer a possible explanation to how cannabidiol can directly modulate effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on the cannabinoid receptor type 1."
https://openalex.org/W2964266436,"Increasing evidence demonstrates that ubiquitin specific protease 39 (USP39) plays an oncogenic role in various human tumors. Here, using expression analysis of the publicly available Oncomine database, clinical glioma patient samples, and glioma cells, we found that USP39 was overexpressed in human gliomas. Knockdown of USP39 in glioma cells demonstrated that the protein promoted cell growth, invasion and migration in vitro and in a tumor model in nude mice. To identify mediators of USP39 growth-promoting properties, we used luciferase reporter constructs under transcriptional control of various promoters specific to seven canonical cancer-associated pathways. Luciferase activity from a synthetic TEAD-dependent YAP/TAZ-responsive reporter, as a direct readout of the Hippo signaling pathway, was decreased by 92% in cells with USP39 knockdown, whereas the luciferase activities from the other six cancer pathways, including MAPK/ERK, MAPK/JNK, NFκB, Notch, TGFβ, and Wnt, remained unchanged. TAZ protein expression however was decreased independent of canonical Hippo signaling. Immunohistochemistry revealed a positive correlation between USP39 and TAZ proteins in orthotopic xenografts derived from modified glioma cells expressing USP39 shRNAs and primary human glioma samples (p < 0.05). Finally, loss of USP39 decreased TAZ pre-mRNA splicing efficiency in glioma cells in vitro, which led to reduced levels of TAZ protein. In summary, USP39 has oncogenic properties that increase TAZ protein levels by inducing maturation of its mRNA. USP39 therefore provides a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of human glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2963697475,"Multiple statistical approaches have been proposed to validate reference genes in qPCR assays. However, conflicting results from these statistical methods pose a major hurdle in the choice of the best reference genes. Recent studies have proposed the use of at least three different methods but there is no consensus on how to interpret conflicting results. Researchers resort to averaging the stability ranks assessed by different approaches or attributing a weighted rank to candidate genes. However, we report here that the suitability of these validation methods can be influenced by the experimental setting. Therefore, averaging the ranks can lead to suboptimal assessment of stable reference genes if the method used is not suitable for analysis. As the respective approaches of these statistical methods are different, a clear understanding of the fundamental assumptions and the parameters that influence the calculation of reference gene stability is necessary. In this study, the stability of 10 candidate reference genes (Actb, Gapdh, Tbp, Sdha, Pgk1, Ppia, Rpl13a, Hsp60, Mrpl10, Rps26) was assessed using four common statistical approaches (GeNorm, NormFinder, Coefficient of Variation or CV analysis and Pairwise ΔCt method) in a longitudinal experimental setting. We used the development of the cerebellum and the spinal cord of mice as a model to assess the suitability of these statistical methods for reference gene validation. GeNorm and the Pairwise ΔCt were found to be ill suited due to a fundamental assumption in their stability calculations. Highly correlated genes were given better stability ranks despite significant overall variation. NormFinder fares better but the presence of highly variable genes influences the ranking of all genes because of the algorithm’s construct. CV analysis estimates overall variation, but it fails to consider variation across groups. We thus highlight the assumptions and potential pitfalls of each method using our longitudinal data. Based on our results, we have devised a workflow combining NormFinder, CV analysis along with visual representation of mRNA fold changes and one-way ANOVA for validating reference genes in longitudinal studies. This workflow proves to be more robust than any of these methods used individually."
https://openalex.org/W2963494781,"Tripartite motif-containing protein 65 (TRIM65) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a critical regulator of a variety of cellular processes as well as tumor progression. Therefore, more substrates must be identified in the physiology or disease context. Here, we found that TRIM65 is upregulated and associated with poor survival in colorectal cancer (CRC). More specifically, high expression of TRIM65 is associated with CRC metastasis and recurrence. Ectopic overexpression of TRIM65 in CRC cell lines enhanced proliferation, invasion, and migration, while knockdown of TRIM65 expression had the opposite effects. Furthermore, we identified a new substrate of TRIM65, namely ARHGAP35, a Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is involved in polarized cell migration. Phenotypically, forced expression of TRIM65 induces increased production of migration-related structures, focal adhesions, and/or filopodia and enhances CRC metastasis to the liver or the lung in a mouse model. Mechanistic studies revealed that TRIM65 mediates ubiquitination of ARHGAP35, whose degradation leads to elevated Rho GTPase activity. In addition, we identified several phosphorylation sites on TRIM65. In sum, we reveal a novel TRIM65–GAP–Rho regulatory axis that modulates the actin cytoskeleton and the migration behavior of CRC cells, and the TRIM65–ARHGAP35 interaction might be a valuable therapeutic target in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2962981222,"How the somatosensory cortex (S1) encodes complex patterns of touch, such as those that occur during tactile exploration, is poorly understood. In the mouse whisker S1, temporally dense stimulation of local whisker pairs revealed that most neurons are not classical single-whisker feature detectors, but instead are strongly tuned to two-whisker sequences that involve the columnar whisker (CW) and one specific surround whisker (SW), usually in a SW-leading-CW order. Tuning was spatiotemporally precise and diverse across cells, generating a rate code for local motion vectors defined by SW-CW combinations. Spatially asymmetric, sublinear suppression for suboptimal combinations and near-linearity for preferred combinations sharpened combination tuning relative to linearly predicted tuning. This resembles computation of motion direction selectivity in vision. SW-tuned neurons, misplaced in the classical whisker map, had the strongest combination tuning. Thus, each S1 column contains a rate code for local motion sequences involving the CW, thus providing a basis for higher-order feature extraction."

https://openalex.org/W2964006429,"The elementary stimulus features encoded by the olfactory system remain poorly understood. We examined the relationship between 1,666 physical-chemical descriptors of odors and the activity of olfactory bulb inputs and outputs in awake mice. Glomerular and mitral and tufted cell responses were sparse and locally heterogeneous, with only a weak dependence of their positions on physical-chemical properties. Odor features represented by ensembles of mitral and tufted cells were overlapping but distinct from those represented in glomeruli, which is consistent with an extensive interplay between feedforward and feedback inputs to the bulb. This reformatting was well described as a rotation in odor space. The physical-chemical descriptors accounted for a small fraction in response variance, and the similarity of odors in the physical-chemical space was a poor predictor of similarity in neuronal representations. Our results suggest that commonly used physical-chemical properties are not systematically represented in bulbar activity and encourage further searches for better descriptors of odor space."
https://openalex.org/W2963664270,"The halophyte Suaeda salsa displayed strong resistance to salinity. Up to date, molecular mechanisms underlying tolerance of S. salsa to salinity have not been well understood. In the present study, S. salsa seedlings were treated with 30‰ salinity and then leaves and roots were subjected to Illumina sequencing. Compared with the control, 68,599 and 77,250 unigenes were significantly differentially expressed in leaves and roots in saline treatment, respectively. KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that photosynthesis process, carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolisms were all downregulated in saline treatment, which should inhibit growth of S. salsa. Expression levels of Na+/H+ exchanger, V-H+ ATPase, choline monooxygenase, potassium and chloride channels were upregulated in saline treatment, which could relieve reduce over-accumulation of Na+ and Cl-. Fe-SOD, glutathione, L-ascorbate and flavonoids function as antioxidants in plants. Genes in relation to them were all upregulated, suggesting that S. salsa initiated various antioxidant mechanisms to tolerate high salinity. Besides, plant hormones, especially auxin, ethylene and jasmonic acid signaling transduction pathways were all upregulated in response to saline treatment, which were important to gene regulations of ion transportation and antioxidation. These changes might comprehensively contribute to tolerance of S. salsa to salinity. Overall, the present study provided new insights to understand the mechanisms underlying tolerance to salinity in halophytes."

https://openalex.org/W2962919985,"Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae is a wasp that parasitizes and host-feeds on pupae of the invasive spotted-wing drosophila (SWD, Drosophila suzukii). Few studies have addressed interactions between these two species and little is known about the potential of this parasitoid as a biocontrol agent of SWD and the different variables that may affect it. Here, we investigated the impact of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on life-history traits of P. vindemmiae. Both constant (entire adulthood) and limited (30 minutes) supplies of water + honey, honey, or host increased parasitoid survival compared to controls (water or fasting). Water + honey caused the highest parasitoid survivals (35–60 days), independent of supply period, sex, and host availability. Females were intrinsically more resistant to water- and honey-deprivation than males, and host-feeding elevated such resistance even higher. Constant honey supply (either with or without water) supported the highest host-killing capacities (= capacity to kill hosts) (ca. 600 SWD pupae/wasp). However, in young females (4–9 days old), the impact of honey availability (with or without water) was insignificant while water deprivation (either with or without honey) caused the highest host-killing potential. This indicates that although sugar becomes a critical nutritional resource as females age, young females depend more on water than sugar to reproduce. Neither water nor honey affected the sex ratio of young females, but when we considered the entire adulthood, the availability of honey caused the lowest proportion of females (0.50), independent of water availability. Neither water nor honey affected parasitoid emergence rate (0.97), independent of female age. Based on survival and host-killing capacity, we conclude that P. vindemmiae has a tremendous biocontrol potential against SWD. Both limited and constant supply of water, sugar, and host increase parasitoid survival, while constant supply of water and/or honey enhance its host-killing potential and decrease sex ratio depending on maternal age."
https://openalex.org/W2962907733,"The prototypical kinase c-Src plays an important role in numerous signal transduction pathways, where its activity is tightly regulated by two phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation at a specific tyrosine by C-terminal Src kinase inactivates c-Src, whereas autophosphorylation is essential for the c-Src activation process. However, the structural consequences of the autophosphorylation process still remain elusive. Here we investigate how the structural landscape of c-Src is shaped by nucleotide binding and phosphorylation of Tyr416 using biochemical experiments, hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS, and atomistic molecular simulations. We show that the initial steps of kinase activation involve large rearrangements in domain orientation. The kinase domain is highly dynamic and has strong cross-talk with the regulatory domains, which are displaced by autophosphorylation. Although the regulatory domains become more flexible and detach from the kinase domain because of autophosphorylation, the kinase domain gains rigidity, leading to stabilization of the ATP binding site and a 4-fold increase in enzymatic activity. Our combined results provide a molecular framework of the central steps in c-Src kinase regulation process with possible implications for understanding general kinase activation mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2962979028,"Background The complement system is involved in pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, and might play a role in accelerated atherogenesis in spondylarthropathies (SpA). Hence, we examined complement activation in SpA, and its relationship to antirheumatic treatment, inflammatory and cardiovascular markers. Methods From PSARA, a prospective observational study, we examined 51 SpA patients (31 psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 20 ankylosing spondylitis (AS)), starting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor alone (n = 25), combined with methotrexate (MTX) (n = 10), or MTX monotherapy (n = 16). Complement activation was determined by the soluble terminal complement complex (sC5b-9), inflammation by erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and endothelial function by finger plethysmography (Endopat) at baseline, after 6 weeks and 6 months of treatment. Results SpA patients had sC5b-9 levels at (PsA) or above (AS) the upper limit of the estimated reference range. Median sC5b-9 levels decreased significantly from baseline to 6 weeks, with no significant difference between the AS and PsA group. Notably, a significant reduction in sC5b-9 was observed after administration of TNF inhibitor ± MTX, whereas no significant changes were observed in patients treated with MTX alone. Between 6 weeks and 6 months, sC5b-9 remained stable across all subgroups. Reduction in sC5b-9 was independently related to decreased ESR and CRP, and to increased high density cholesterol and total cholesterol. Reduction in sC5b-9 from baseline to 6 weeks was associated with improved EF in age and gender adjusted analyses. Conclusion TNF-inhibition, but not MTX monotherapy, led to rapid and sustained reduction of complement activation in SpA. Thus, the observed decrease in cardiovascular morbidity in patients treated with TNF-inhibitors might be partly due to its beneficial effect on complement. Trial registration Clinical Trials (NCT00902005), retrospectively registered on the 14th of May 2009."
https://openalex.org/W2963553330,"Bacterial adhesins attach their hosts to surfaces through one or more ligand-binding domains. In RTX adhesins, which are localized to the outer membrane of many Gram-negative bacteria via the type I secretion system, we see several examples of a putative sugar-binding domain. Here we have recombinantly expressed one such ~20-kDa domain from the ~340-kDa adhesin found in Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, an oil-degrading bacterium. The sugar-binding domain was purified from E. coli with a yield of 100 mg/L of culture. Circular dichroism analysis showed that the protein was rich in beta-structure, was moderately heat resistant, and required Ca2+ for proper folding. A crystal structure was obtained in Ca2+ at 1.2-Å resolution, which showed the presence of three Ca2+ ions, two of which were needed for structural integrity and one for binding sugars. Glucose was soaked into the crystal, where it bound to the sugar’s two vicinal hydroxyl groups attached to the first and second (C1 and C2) carbons in the pyranose ring. This attraction to glucose caused the protein to bind certain polysaccharide-based column matrices and was used in a simple competitive binding assay to assess the relative affinity of sugars for the protein’s ligand-binding site. Fucose, glucose and N-acetylglucosamine bound most tightly, and N-acetylgalactosamine hardly bound at all. Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to determine specific binding affinities, which lie in the 100-μM range. Glycan arrays were tested to expand the range of ligand sugars assayed, and showed that MhPA14 bound preferentially to branched polymers containing terminal sugars highlighted as strong binders in the competitive binding assay. Some of these binders have vicinal hydroxyl groups attached to the C3 and C4 carbons that are sterically equivalent to those presented by the C1 and C2 carbons of glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2962909797,"The production and productivity of rice (Oryza sativa L.) are primarily influenced by the application of the critical nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). However, excessive application of these fertilizers is detrimental to the environment and increases the cost of production. Hence, there is a need to develop varieties that simultaneously increase yields under both optimal and suboptimal rates of fertilizer application by maximizing nutrient use efficiency (NuUE). To unravel the hidden genetic variation and understand the molecular and physiological mechanisms of NuUE, three different mapping populations (MPs; BC1F5) derived from three donors (Haoannong, Cheng-Hui 448, and Zhong 413) and recipient Weed Tolerant Rice 1 were developed. A total of three favorable agronomic traits (FATs) were considered as the measure of NuUE. Analysis of variance and descriptive statistics indicated the existence of genetic variation for NuUE and quantitative inheritance of FATs. The genotypic data from single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from Tunable Genotyping-By-Sequencing (tGBS) and phenotypic values were used for locating the genomic regions conferring NuUE. A total of 19 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected, out of which 11 QTLs were putative on eight chromosomes, which individually explained 17.02% to 34.85% of the phenotypic variation. Notably, qLC-II_1 and qLC-II_11 detected at zero fertilizer application showed higher performance for LC under zero percentage of NPK fertilizer. The remarkable findings of the present study are that the detected QTLs were associated in building tolerance to low/no nutrient application and six candidate genes on chromosomes 2 and 5 within these putative QTLs were found associated with low nutrient tolerance and related to several physiological and metabolic pathways involved in abiotic stress tolerance. The identified superior introgressed lines (ILs) and trait-associated genetic regions can be effectively used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for NuUE breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2963608383,"p53 is known to play a role in iron homeostasis and is required for FDXR-mediated iron metabolism via iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2). Interestingly, p53 is frequently mutated in tumors wherein iron is often accumulated, suggesting that mutant p53 may exert its gain of function by altering iron metabolism. In this study, we found that FDXR deficiency decreased mutant p53 expression along with altered iron metabolism in p53R270H/− MEFs and cancer cells carrying mutant p53. Consistently, we found that decreased expression of mutant p53 by FDXR deficiency inhibited mutant p53-R270H to induce carcinoma and high grade pleomorphic sarcoma in FDXR+/−; p53R270H/− mice as compared with p53R270H/− mice. Moreover, we found that like its effect on wild-type p53, loss of IRP2 increased mutant p53 expression. However, unlike its effect to suppress cell growth in cells carrying wild-type p53, loss of IRP2 promoted cell growth in cancer cells expressing mutant p53. Finally, we found that ectopic expression of IRP2 suppressed cell growth in a mutant p53-dependent manner. Together, our data indicate that mutant p53 gain-of-function can be suppressed by IRP2 and FDXR deficiency, both of which may be explored to target tumors carrying mutant p53."
https://openalex.org/W2963908062,"Objective To evaluate the association between the endometriosis phenotype and the age at menarche. Design An observational, cross-sectional study using prospectively collected data (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). Setting Single university tertiary referral center. Patients To be eligible, women had to have undergone their 1st complete surgical exeresis of endometriotic lesions. For each patient, a standardized questionnaire was completed the month before the surgery. Endometriotic lesions were classified into 3 phenotypes: superficial peritoneal endometriosis (SUP), endometrioma (OMA), or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). Patients were divided into 3 groups: early menarche (< 12 years), typical menarche (≥ 12 and ≤ 13 years) and late menarche (> 13 years). The groups were compared in terms of general characteristics, medical history, disease phenotype, and disease severity. Interventions Surgical management for a benign gynecologic condition. Main Outcome Measure(s) Correlation between the endometriosis phenotype and the age at menarche. Measurements and main results From January 2004 to December 2016, 789 women with histologically confirmed endometriosis were enrolled in the study. The mean age at menarche was 12.9 ± 1.6 years of age, (range 9 to 18). The mean age at menarche and the mean time interval between menarche and the 1st surgery for endometriosis were not significantly different between the three phenotypes (SUP, OMA, DIE). When women with early menarche, typical menarche, or late menarche were compared, no differences were observed in terms of the endometriosis phenotype and the anatomical distribution of the endometriotic lesions. Conclusion For women operated for the first time for endometriosis, age at menarche is not associated with the disease phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2963537607,"Objective To estimate the productivity impacts of a policy intervention on the prevention of premature mortality due to obesity. Methods A simulation model of the Australian population over the period from 2003 to 2030 was developed to estimate productivity gains associated with premature deaths averted due to an obesity prevention intervention that applied a 10% tax on unhealthy foods. Outcome measures were the total working years gained, and the present value of lifetime income (PVLI) gained. Impacts were modelled over the period from 2003 to 2030. Costs are reported in 2018 Australian dollars and a 3% discount rate was applied to all future benefits. Results Premature deaths averted due to a junk food tax accounted for over 8,000 additional working years and a $307 million increase in PVLI. Deaths averted in men between the ages of 40 to 59, and deaths averted from ischaemic heart disease, were responsible for the largest gains. Conclusions The productivity gains associated with a junk food tax are substantial, accounting for almost twice the value of the estimated savings to the health care system. The results we have presented provide evidence that the adoption of a societal perspective, when compared to a health sector perspective, provides a more comprehensive estimate of the cost-effectiveness of a junk food tax."
https://openalex.org/W2963688137,"The pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella, is a world-wide pest of cotton and in some parts of the cotton growing region is controlled by the mating disruption technique using synthetic sex pheromone. The sex pheromone consists of two compounds, (Z,Z)- and (Z,E)-7,11-hexadecadienyl acetates, in about a 50:50 ratio. However, recently, a population with sex pheromone compound ratios of about 62:38 were found in cotton fields that use mating disruption in Israel. To investigate how the change developed, we compared the pheromone gland transcriptomes between a reference laboratory population and a population obtained from an Israeli cotton field utilizing mating disruption. We analyzed four biological replicates from each population and found transcripts encoding 17 desaturases, 8 reductases, and 17 candidate acetyltransferases in both populations, which could be involved in sex pheromone biosynthesis. The expression abundance of some genes between the two populations was different. Some desaturases and candidate acetyltransferases were found to have mutated in one of the populations. The differentially expressed genes play potential roles in sex pheromone biosynthesis and could be involved in causing altered female sex pheromone ratios in the field population."
https://openalex.org/W2963180416,"Among calyptraeid gastropods, males become females as they get older, and egg capsules containing developing embryos are maintained beneath the mother's shell until the encapsulated embryos hatch. Crepipatella dilatata is an interesting biological model considering that is an estuarine species and thus periodically exposed to elevated environment-physiological pressures. Presently, there is not much information about the reproductive biology and brooding parameters of this gastropod. This paper describes field and laboratory observations monitoring sex changes, brooding frequencies, sizes of brooding females, egg mass characteristics, and embryonic hatching conditions. Our findings indicate that C. dilatata is a direct-developing protandric hermaphrodite, changing from male to female when individuals were between 18 and 20 mm in shell length. At our study site in Quempillén estuary, females were found to be brooding almost continuously throughout the year, having an average maximum of 85% of simultaneous brooding, with a short rest from April through June. No relationship was found between the number of capsules per egg mass and the size of the brooding female. However, capsule size and the number of embryos and nurse eggs were strongly related to female size. The offspring hatched with an average shell length > 1 mm. About 25% of the hatched capsules were found to contain both metamorphosed (juveniles) and non-metamorphosed (veliger) individuals. The sizes of the latter were < 1000 μm. The length of hatching juveniles was inversely related to the number of individuals per capsule, which seems related to differences in the availability of nurse eggs per embryo. Although fecundity per reproductive event of this species is relatively low (maximum approx. 800 offspring per egg mass) compared with those of calyptraeid species showing mixed development, the overall reproductive potential of C. dilatata seems to be high considering that females can reproduce up to 5 times per year, protecting their encapsulated embryos from physical stresses until well-developed juveniles are released into the population, avoiding a dangerous pelagic period prior to metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2964166397,"Coping with mental challenges is vital to everyday functioning. In accordance with prominent theories, the adaptive and flexible adjustment of the organism to daily demands is well expressed in task-related changes of cardiac vagal control. While many mental challenges are associated with increased effort and associated decreased task-related heart rate variability (HRV), some cognitive challenges go along with HRV increases. Especially creativity represents a cognitive process, which not only results from mental effort but also from spontaneous modes of thinking. Critically, creativity and HRV are associated with regular exercising and fitness. Furthermore, the cross-stressor adaptation theory suggests that changes in cardiac reactions to physical challenges may generalize to mental challenges. In line with this idea the amount of regular exercising was hypothesized to moderate the association between HRV changes and creativity. A sample of 97 participants was investigated. They reported the amount of regular exercise and their ECG was measured at baseline and during a creativity task. An association between task-related HRV changes and originality as a function of participants’ amount of regular exercise was found. Participants reporting more regular exercising produced more original ideas when they had higher HRV increases during the task, while more sedentary participants showed the opposite association. Results suggest that individuals with a higher amount of regular exercise achieve higher originality probably via the engagement in more spontaneous modes of thinking, while more sedentary people may primarily benefit from increased mental effort. This supports the conclusion that higher creativity can be achieved by different strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2962713189,"Motivational intensity has been previously linked to information processing. In particular, it has been argued that affects which are high in motivational intensity tend to narrow cognitive scope. A similar effect has been attributed to negative affect, which has been linked to narrowing of cognitive scope. In this paper, we investigated how these phenomena manifest themselves during visual word search. We conducted three studies in which participants were instructed to perform word category identification. We manipulated motivational intensity by controlling reward expectations and affect via reward outcomes. Importantly, we altered visual search paradigms, assessing the effects of affective manipulations as modulated by information arrangement. We recorded multiple physiological signals (EEG, EDA, ECG and eye tracking) to assess whether motivational states can be predicted by physiology. Across the three studies, we found that high motivational intensity narrowed visual attentional scope by altering visual search strategies, especially when information was displayed sparsely. Instead, when information was vertically listed, approach-directed motivational intensity appeared to improve memory encoding. We also observed that physiology, in particular eye tracking, may be used to detect biases induced by motivational intensity, especially when information is sparsely organised."
https://openalex.org/W2962758536,"Telomere length (TL) is a prognostic indicator in Caucasian chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but its significance in Asian CLL remains unknown. To investigate the prognostic significance of TL and its correlation with cytogenetic aberrations and somatic mutations, we analyzed TL measurements at the cellular level by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in patients with CLL in Korea. The present study enrolled 110 patients (41 females and 69 males) diagnosed with CLL according to the World Health Organization criteria (2001–2017). TLs of bone marrow nucleated cells at the single-cell level were measured by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) in 71 patients. The correlations of TL with clinical characteristics, cytogenetic aberrations, genetic mutations, and overall survival were assessed. The median value of mean TL in CLL patients (T/C ratio 7.46 (range 1.19–18.14) was significantly shorter than that in the normal controls (T/C ratio 15.28 (range 8.59–24.93) (p < 0.001). Shorter TLs were associated with complex karyotypes (p = 0.030), del(11q22) (p = 0.023), presence of deletion and/or mutation in ATM and/or TP53 (p = 0.019), and SH2B3 mutation (p = 0.015). A shorter TL was correlated with lower hemoglobin levels and adverse survival (mean TL < 9.35, p = 0.021). When the proportion of cells with extremely short TLs (< 7.61) was greater than 90%, CLL patients showed poor survival (p = 0.002). Complex karyotypes, TP53 mutation, and the number of mutated genes were determined to be significant adverse variables by multivariable Cox analysis (p = 0.011, p = 0.002, and p = 0.002, respectively). TL was attrited in CLL, and attrited telomeres were correlated with adverse survival and other well-known adverse prognostic factors. We infer that TL is an independent adverse prognostic predictor in Korean CLL."
https://openalex.org/W2963327059,"Chlorothalonil (2,4,5,6-tetrachloroisophtalonitrile; TPN) is one of the most commonly used fungicides in the United States. Given TPN′s widespread use, general toxicity, and potential carcinogenicity, its biodegradation has garnered significant attention. Here, we developed a direct spectrophotometric assay for the Zn(II)-dependent, chlorothalonil-hydrolyzing dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. CTN-3 (Chd), enabling determination of its metal-binding properties; pH dependence of the kinetic parameters kcat, Km, and kcat/Km; and solvent isotope effects. We found that a single Zn(II) ion binds a Chd monomer with a Kd of 0.17 μm, consistent with inductively coupled plasma MS data for the as-isolated Chd dimer. We observed that Chd was maximally active toward chlorothalonil in the pH range 7.0–9.0, and fits of these data yielded a pKES1 of 5.4 ± 0.2, a pKES2 of 9.9 ± 0.1 (k′cat = 24 ± 2 s−1), a pKE1 of 5.4 ± 0.3, and a pKE2 of 9.5 ± 0.1 (k′cat/k′m = 220 ± 10 s−1 mm−1). Proton inventory studies indicated that one proton is transferred in the rate-limiting step of the reaction at pD 7.0. Fits of UV-visible stopped-flow data suggested a three-step model and provided apparent rate constants for intermediate formation (i.e. a k′2 of 35.2 ± 0.1 s−1) and product release (i.e. a k′3 of 1.1 ± 0.2 s−1), indicating that product release is the slow step in catalysis. On the basis of these results, along with those previously reported, we propose a mechanism for Chd catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2963219544,"Serum hypertonicity may develop during diabetes mellitus due to hyperglycemia and other biochemical changes. Hypertonicity may produce detrimental cellular and systemic effects and has been identified as a serum marker for some clinical disorders. In non-diabetic dogs, the mean cell volume difference, a novel erythrocyte measure, is increased by serum hypertonicity. However, it is not known whether hyperglycemic hypertonicity produces a similar change. The hypothesis that the mean cell volume difference could detect serum hypertonicity in diabetes was investigated in a group of thirty-two dogs with naturally-occurring diabetes mellitus that were prospectively recruited over a 1-year period from the outpatient population of a veterinary teaching hospital. The effect of hyperglycemia on the mean cell volume difference and the ability of the mean cell volume difference to predict serum hypertonicity were examined. Serum hyperosmolality and hypertonicity due to hyperglycemia was present in 91% and 94% of dogs, respectively. Hyperglycemia was the principal cause identified for serum hypertonicity and hyperosmolality. Using a cut-off value of ≥ 3 μm3 for the mean cell volume difference, serum hypertonicity ≥ 320 mmol/kg was identified with 79% sensitivity and 61% specificity. The dMCV correlated with changes in serum glucose, tonicity, and measured osmolality. Dogs with a mean cell volume difference ≥ 3 μm3 were at risk for serum tonicity ≥ 320 mmol/kg (risk ratio = 2.2) and serum glucose ≥ 13.9 mmol/L (risk ratio = 2.3). In conclusion, the mean cell volume difference is a useful surrogate marker for detecting serum hypertonicity in diabetic dogs and elevated mean cell volume difference is associated with increased risks for clinically relevant serum hypertonicity and hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2963547557,"The success of staphylococci as pathogens has been attributed, in part, to their ability to evade their hosts' immune systems. Although the proteins involved in evasion have been extensively studied in staphylococci affecting humans little characterization has been done with Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, an important cause of pyoderma in dogs. Staphylococcus aureus binder of immunoglobulin (Sbi) interferes with innate immune recognition by interacting with multiple host proteins. In this study, a S. pseudintermedius gene that shares 38% similarity to S. aureus Sbi was cloned from S. pseudintermedius strains representative of major clonal lineages bearing two paralogs of the protein. Binding of immunoglobulins and Fab and Fc fragments as well as interaction with complement was measured. S. pseudintermedius Sbi protein bound IgG from multiple species and canine complement C3, neutralized complement activity and bound to canine IgM and B cells. Evidence from this work suggests Sbi may play an important role in S. pseudintermedius immune evasion."
https://openalex.org/W2964268676,"Several external factors including lunar cycle and weather conditions might be associated with calving conditions. Our objective here was to determine the effects of lunar cycle and weather conditions on calving frequency and the occurrence of preterm calving in Japanese Black cows. Calving records were obtained from 905 farms in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. Data were collected from 41,116 calvings. We conducted two studies: Study 1 investigated the effects of lunar cycle and weather conditions on daily calving frequency (DCF) with the observational unit of each day and Study 2 investigated those effects on the occurrence of preterm calving with the observational unit for each calving. Preterm calving was defined by whether or not a cow calving before 280 days of gestation, lower 10th percentile of gestation length of the collected data, and by whether or not a cow calving before 289 days of gestation, median of the gestation length. For Study 1, lunar cycle was not associated with DCF in all cows, in only primiparous cows and in only multiparous cows. As well as lunar cycle, weather conditions such as temperature, diurnal temperature variation, the temperature-humidity index, precipitation amount, barometric pressure, relative humidity and solar radiation, were also not associated with DCF. For Study 2, lunar cycle phases were not associated with the occurrence of preterm calving. However, preterm calving was associated with all of the weather conditions (P < 0.05) except for precipitation amounts and solar radiation. Temperature, the temperature-humidity index and relative humidity were positively associated with the occurrence of preterm calving. In contrast, diurnal temperature variations and barometric pressure were negatively associated with the occurrence of preterm calving. In conclusion, the lunar cycle was not associated with DCF and preterm calving, but the weather conditions were associated with preterm calving."
https://openalex.org/W2962966529,"Rapid endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced export (RESET) is undoubtedly beneficial in that it eliminates misfolded prion protein (PrP) from a stressed ER. Considering that RESET induces rapid endocytosis of misfolded PrP for degradation, it is questionable whether RESET is beneficial when its product amount overwhelms the capacity of subsequent clearance pathways. We require a strategy to monitor the endocytic flux rate of misfolded PrPs. Here, we stabilized misfolded PrPs by inserting red fluorescent protein (RFP) and indirectly determined this rate by monitoring the lysosomal free RFP. We discovered a surveillance mechanism that limits endocytosis of misfolded PrPs through plasma membrane quality control (pmQC). pmQC was regulated by the thiol-disulfide status of misfolded PrPs and consequently accumulates nonpathogenic PrP variants at the plasma membrane. This variant alleviated prion proteotoxicity induced by persistent RESET. Thus, PrP endocytosis is regulated by pmQC to ensure the safety of endolysosomal pathway from persistent internalization of misfolded PrP.-Lee, D., Lee, S., Shin, Y., Song, Y., Kang, S.-W.
