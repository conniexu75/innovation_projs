https://openalex.org/W3004461655,"CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing provides a powerful tool to enhance the natural ability of human T cells to fight cancer. We report a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 editing to engineer T cells in three patients with refractory cancer. Two genes encoding the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) chains, TCRα (TRAC) and TCRβ (TRBC), were deleted in T cells to reduce TCR mispairing and to enhance the expression of a synthetic, cancer-specific TCR transgene (NY-ESO-1). Removal of a third gene encoding programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1), was performed to improve antitumor immunity. Adoptive transfer of engineered T cells into patients resulted in durable engraftment with edits at all three genomic loci. Although chromosomal translocations were detected, the frequency decreased over time. Modified T cells persisted for up to 9 months, suggesting that immunogenicity is minimal under these conditions and demonstrating the feasibility of CRISPR gene editing for cancer immunotherapy."

García de Arquer et al. addressed this problem by combining a copper electrocatalyst with an ionomer assembly that intersperses sulfonate-lined paths for the H 2 O with fluorocarbon channels for the CO 2 . The electrode architecture enables production of two-carbon products such as ethylene and ethanol at current densities just over an ampere per square centimeter. Science , this issue p. 661"

Many proteins that undergo LLPS include prionlike domains (PLDs), which are enriched in polar amino acids and often interspersed with aromatic residues. Combining experimental data with simulations, Martin et al. quantified concentrations of PLDs in coexisting dilute and dense phases as a function of temperature and show that the phase behavior is determined by the number of aromatic residues and their patterning, with uniform patterning of aromatic residues promoting LLPS and inhibiting aggregation. They developed a sticker-and-spacers model that can predict the phase behavior of PLDs on the basis of their sequence. Science , this issue p. 694"
https://openalex.org/W3005253578,"Energy stress depletes ATP and induces cell death. Here we identify an unexpected inhibitory role of energy stress on ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death induced by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. We found that ferroptotic cell death and lipid peroxidation can be inhibited by treatments that induce or mimic energy stress. Inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of cellular energy status, largely abolishes the protective effects of energy stress on ferroptosis in vitro and on ferroptosis-associated renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury in vivo. Cancer cells with high basal AMPK activation are resistant to ferroptosis and AMPK inactivation sensitizes these cells to ferroptosis. Functional and lipidomic analyses further link AMPK regulation of ferroptosis to AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Our study demonstrates that energy stress inhibits ferroptosis partly through AMPK and reveals an unexpected coupling between ferroptosis and AMPK-mediated energy-stress signalling."

Soroye et al. analyzed a large dataset of bumble bee occurrences across North America and Europe and found that an increasing frequency of unusually hot days is increasing local extinction rates, reducing colonization and site occupancy, and decreasing species richness within a region, independent of land-use change or condition (see the Perspective by Bridle and van Rensburg). As average temperatures continue to rise, bumble bees may be faced with an untenable increase in frequency of extreme temperatures. Science , this issue p. 685 ; see also p. 626"
https://openalex.org/W3004547734,"Microglia modulate memories Synaptic reorganization and circuit rewiring leads to loss or weakening of connections between neurons and may result in the erasure of previously formed memories. Microglia eliminate excessive synapses in the developing brain and regulate the dynamics of synaptic connections between neurons throughout life. However, it is still unclear whether forgetting is related to microglia activity and how microglia regulate memory erasure in the adult brain. Wang et al. discovered that microglia eliminated synaptic components in the adult hippocampus and that depleting microglia or inhibiting phagocytosis of microglia prevented forgetting. Synapse elimination by microglia may thus lead to degradation of memory engrams and forgetting of previously learned contextual fear memory. Science , this issue p. 688"

The molecular features that confer these circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with metastatic potential are poorly understood. Ebright et al. studied CTCs from breast cancer patients and found that cells with increased expression levels of certain ribosomal proteins and regulators of translation had greater metastatic capacity in a mouse model (see the Perspective by Ma and Jeffrey). Consistent with this finding, patients with higher levels of this subset of CTCs tended to have a poorer prognosis. Science , this issue p. 1468 ; see also p. 1424"
https://openalex.org/W3004978237,"Liver cell death has an essential role in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The activity of the energy sensor adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is repressed in NASH. Liver-specific AMPK knockout aggravated liver damage in mouse NASH models. AMPK phosphorylated proapoptotic caspase-6 protein to inhibit its activation, keeping hepatocyte apoptosis in check. Suppression of AMPK activity relieved this inhibition, rendering caspase-6 activated in human and mouse NASH. AMPK activation or caspase-6 inhibition, even after the onset of NASH, improved liver damage and fibrosis. Once phosphorylation was decreased, caspase-6 was activated by caspase-3 or -7. Active caspase-6 cleaved Bid to induce cytochrome c release, generating a feedforward loop that leads to hepatocyte death. Thus, the AMPK-caspase-6 axis regulates liver damage in NASH, implicating AMPK and caspase-6 as therapeutic targets."

These membranes can let water pass but reject gases such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).

We quantified the dimerization of three prototypic class I cytokine receptors in the plasma membrane of living cells by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Spatial and spatiotemporal correlation of individual receptor subunits showed ligand-induced dimerization and revealed that the associated Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) dimerizes through its pseudokinase domain. Oncogenic receptor and hyperactive JAK2 mutants promoted ligand-independent dimerization, highlighting the formation of receptor dimers as the switch responsible for signal activation. Atomistic modeling and molecular dynamics simulations based on a detailed energetic analysis of the interactions involved in dimerization yielded a mechanistic blueprint for homodimeric class I cytokine receptor activation and its dysregulation by individual mutations."

These insects use body heat to locate and feed on warm-blooded hosts, but the molecular basis of such behavior is unknown. Here, we identify ionotropic receptor IR21a, a receptor conserved throughout insects, as a key mediator of heat seeking in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Although Ir21a mediates heat avoidance in Drosophila, we find it drives heat seeking and heat-stimulated blood feeding in Anopheles At a cellular level, Ir21a is essential for the detection of cooling, suggesting that during evolution mosquito heat seeking relied on cooling-mediated repulsion. Our data indicate that the evolution of blood feeding in Anopheles involves repurposing an ancestral thermoreceptor from non-blood-feeding Diptera."
https://openalex.org/W3005060052,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are very large proteinaceous assemblies that consist of more than 500 individual proteins1,2. NPCs are essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport of different cellular components, and disruption of the integrity of NPCs has been linked to aging, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases3–7. However, the mechanism by which membrane-embedded NPCs are turned over is currently unknown. Here we show that, after nitrogen starvation or genetic interference with the architecture of NPCs, nucleoporins are rapidly degraded in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that NPC turnover involves vacuolar proteases and the core autophagy machinery. Autophagic degradation is mediated by the cytoplasmically exposed Nup159, which serves as intrinsic cargo receptor and directly binds to the autophagy marker protein Atg8. Autophagic degradation of NPCs is therefore inducible, enabling the removal of individual NPCs from the nuclear envelope. Lee et al. show that, after nitrogen starvation and genetic interference with the architecture of nuclear pore complexes, nucleoporins are degraded by autophagy, constituting a quality-control step at the nuclear envelope."

https://openalex.org/W3004615009,"PARP1 and PARP2 play critical roles in regulating DNA repair and PARP inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian and breast cancers. It has long been known that PARP inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents independent of BRCA status, however, clinical use of PARP inhibitors in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapy is limited by the more-than-additive cytotoxicity. The natural compound alantolactone (ATL) inhibits the thioredoxin reductase to induce ROS accumulation and oxidative DNA damage selectively in cancer cells. Here, we showed that nontoxic doses of ATL markedly synergized with the PARP inhibitor olaparib to result in synthetic lethality irrespective of homologous recombination status. Synergistic cytotoxicity was seen in cancer but not noncancerous cells and was reduced by the ROS inhibitor NAC or knockdown of OGG1, demonstrating that the cytotoxicity resulted from the repair of ATL-induced oxidative DNA damage. PARP1 knockdown suppressed the synergistic lethality and olaparib was much more toxic than veliparib when combined with ATL, suggesting PARP-trapping as the primary inducer of cytotoxicity. Consistently, combined use of ATL and olaparib caused intense signs of replication stress and formation of double strand DNA breaks, leading to S and G2 arrest followed by apoptosis. In vivo, the combination effectively induced regression of tumor xenografts, while either agent alone had no effect. Hence, PARP trapping combined with specific pro-oxidative agents may provide safe and effective ways to broaden the therapeutic potential of PARP inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W3004553547,"Resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) suppress allergic inflammation in murine asthma models. Previously we reported that resident AMs can blunt inflammatory signaling in alveolar epithelial cells (ECs) by transcellular delivery of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) within extracellular vesicles (EVs). Here we examined the role of vesicular SOCS3 secretion as a mechanism by which AMs restrain allergic inflammatory responses in airway ECs. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of SOCS3 were reduced in asthmatics and in allergen-challenged mice. Ex vivo SOCS3 secretion was reduced in AMs from challenged mice and this defect was mimicked by exposing normal AMs to cytokines associated with allergic inflammation. Both AM-derived EVs and synthetic SOCS3 liposomes inhibited the activation of STAT3 and STAT6 as well as cytokine gene expression in ECs challenged with IL-4/IL-13 and house dust mite (HDM) extract. This suppressive effect of EVs was lost when they were obtained from AMs exposed to allergic inflammation-associated cytokines. Finally, inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine generation in the lungs of OVA-challenged mice were attenuated by intrapulmonary pretreatment with SOCS3 liposomes. Overall, AM secretion of SOCS3 within EVs serves as a brake on airway EC responses during allergic inflammation, but is impaired in asthma. Synthetic liposomes encapsulating SOCS3 can rescue this defect and may serve as a framework for novel therapeutic approaches targeting airway inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3004671470,"Serine has critical roles in maintaining cell growth and redox balance in cancer cells. However, the role of exogenous serine played in oxidative response and proliferation in normal mammalian intestine need to be further elucidated. We used a mouse model and intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) to reveal that exogenous serine deficiency did not lead to redox imbalance and inhibition of proliferation in the intestine. However, serine deficiency exacerbated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inhibition of proliferation in IPEC-J2 cells challenged by hydrogen peroxide, while serine supplementation rescued redox imbalance and those proliferation defects. Importantly, serine supplementation restored the glutathione content and decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, while no such effects were observed when glutathione synthesis was inhibited. Additionally, serine supplementation increased nuclear nrf2 expression in IPEC-J2 cells. These results suggested that serine alleviates oxidative stress through supporting glutathione synthesis and activating nrf2 signaling. We further found that serine supplementation activated the mTOR pathway, while inhibition of mTOR diminished the effects of serine on promoting proliferation, suggesting critical roles of the mTOR pathway in this context. Taken together, our study underlines the importance of serine in the maintenance of redox status and proliferation in the intestine and reveals a novel potential mechanism that mediates these effects."

Furin, a proprotein convertase, is highly expressed in high-grade serous carcinoma of ovarian cancer patients, and its expression is even higher in tumor omentum than in normal omentum, the preferred site of ovarian cancer metastasis. The proteolytic actions of this cellular endoprotease help the maturation of several important precursors of protein substrates and its levels increase the risk of several cancer. We show that furin activates the IGF1R/STAT3 signaling axis in ovarian cancer cells. Conversely, furin knockdown downregulated IGF1R-β and p-STAT3 (Tyr705) expression. Further, silencing furin reduced tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Collectively, our findings show that furin can be an effective therapeutic target for ovarian cancer prevention or treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3004761102,"Despite empirical observations suggesting that practitioners value the use of substitutions during soccer match-play, limited research has sought to substantiate such claims. This study used online surveys to assess the perceptions of practitioners within professional soccer about the use and practices of substitutes. Thirty-three practitioners completed one of two surveys (each requiring both open and closed questions to be answered), depending upon whether their primary role related mostly to tactical ('tactical practitioners'; n = 7) or physical ('physical practitioners'; n = 26) aspects of player/team management. Thematic content analysis of responses identified four higher-order themes: 'impact of substitutions', 'planning and communication', 'player preparation and recovery' and 'regulations'. Eighty-five percent of practitioners believed that substitutes are important in determining success during soccer match-play, with the primary justification being the perceived ability of such players to provide a physical and/or tactical impact. However, contextual factors such as the match situation, timing of introduction, and players undergoing adequate pre-pitch-entry preparation, may be important for realising such aims. Although many practitioners believed that there was a need for substitutes to engage in bespoke non-match-day preparations and recovery strategies that differ from starting players, logistical considerations, such as scarcity of resources, often limit their scope. Notwithstanding, 96% of respondents indicated that substitutes frequently perform extra conditioning sessions to account for deficits in high-speed running loads compared with players exposed to a longer period of match-play. Substitutes' pre-match warm-ups are typically led by team staff, however practitioners reported providing varying levels of input with regards to the practices adopted between kick-off and pitch-entry. Uncertainty exists as to the efficacy of current pre-pitch-entry practices, and 100% of practitioners highlighted 'preparatory strategies' as at least a 'moderately important' direction for future research. This study presents novel insights and highlights areas that are considered future research priorities amongst those working in the field."

https://openalex.org/W3004616229,"Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA) leads to permanent cartilage destruction, jaw dysfunction, and compromises the quality of life. However, the pathological mechanisms governing TMJ OA are poorly understood. Unlike appendicular articular cartilage, the TMJ has two distinct functions as the synovial joint of the craniofacial complex and also as the site for endochondral jaw bone growth. The established dogma of endochondral bone ossification is that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo apoptosis, while invading vasculature with osteoprogenitors replace cartilage with bone. However, contemporary murine genetic studies support the direct differentiation of chondrocytes into osteoblasts and osteocytes in the TMJ. Here we sought to characterize putative vasculature and cartilage to bone transdifferentiation using healthy and diseased TMJ tissues from miniature pigs and humans. During endochondral ossification, the presence of fully formed vasculature expressing CD31+ endothelial cells and α-SMA+ vascular smooth muscle cells were detected within all cellular zones in growing miniature pigs. Arterial, endothelial, venous, angiogenic, and mural cell markers were significantly upregulated in miniature pig TMJ tissues relative to donor matched knee meniscus fibrocartilage tissue. Upon surgically creating TMJ OA in miniature pigs, we discovered increased vasculature and putative chondrocyte to osteoblast transformation dually marked by COL2 and BSP or RUNX2 within the vascular bundles. Pathological human TMJ tissues also exhibited increased vasculature, while isolated diseased human TMJ cells exhibited marked increased in vasculature markers relative to control 293T cells. Our study provides evidence to suggest that the TMJ in higher order species are in fact vascularized. There have been no reports of cartilage to bone transdifferentiation or vasculature in human-relevant TMJ OA large animal models or in human TMJ tissues and cells. Therefore, these findings may potentially alter the clinical management of TMJ OA by defining new drugs that target angiogenesis or block the cartilage to bone transformation."
https://openalex.org/W3004913933,"Abstract Mitotic slippage involves cells exiting mitosis without proper chromosome segregation. Although degradation of cyclin B1 during prolonged mitotic arrest is believed to trigger mitotic slippage, its upstream regulation remains obscure. Whether mitotic slippage is caused by APC/C CDC20 activity that is able to escape spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC)-mediated inhibition, or is actively promoted by a change in SAC activity remains an outstanding issue. We found that a major culprit for mitotic slippage involves reduction of MAD2 at the kinetochores, resulting in a progressive weakening of SAC during mitotic arrest. A further level of control of the timing of mitotic slippage is through p31 comet -mediated suppression of MAD2 activation. The loss of kinetochore MAD2 was dependent on APC/C CDC20 , indicating a feedback control of APC/C to SAC during prolonged mitotic arrest. The gradual weakening of SAC during mitotic arrest enables APC/C CDC20 to degrade cyclin B1, cumulating in the cell exiting mitosis by mitotic slippage."

However, in case of decreased immunity, viral infection or any other enhancing factors, severe disease can develop. Our aim in this study was to survey the nasal carriage rates of four important respiratory pathogens in three different age groups of children attending nurseries, day-care centres and primary schools. This is the first study from Hungary about the asymptomatic carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Methods Altogether 580 asymptomatic children were screened in three Hungarian cities. Samples were collected from both nostrils with cotton swabs. The identification was based on both colony morphology and species-specific PCRs. Serotyping was performed for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined with agar dilution, according to the EUCAST guidelines. Clonality was examined by PFGE. Results and conclusions Whereas the carriage rates of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis clearly decreased with age, that of S. aureus showed an opposite tendency. Multiple carriage was least prevalent if S. aureus was one of the participants. The negative association between this bacterium and the others was statistically significant. For pneumococcus, the overall carriage rate was lower compared to earlier years, and PCV13 serotypes were present in only 6.2% of the children. The majority of H. influenzae isolates was non-typeable and no type b was detected; serotype A was dominant among M. catarrhalis. All four bacteria were more sensitive to antibiotics compared to clinical isolates. No MRSAs were detected, but we found three mupirocin resistant strains. The positive effect of Hib- and PCV-vaccination is undoubted. Continued surveillance of these pathogens is required."
https://openalex.org/W3004933993,"Background South Africa has a dual system of healthcare model differentiated across socio-economic lines. While on the one hand there exists high quality private facilities that is expensive and accessible to the minority, on the other is the free but stretched and over-crowded public healthcare that the rest of the population relies on. Accessing private facilities requires private medical insurance or requires coping strategies that can lead to household vulnerability. Objective The objective of this study is to analyse the relationship between health shocks and household vulnerability in the South African context of high poverty and low medical insurance penetration rate. Data The study employs data from waves three to five of South Africa’s nationally representative National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) conducted between the period 2012–2017 in approximately two-year intervals. Methods Using food expenditure shock as an indicator for vulnerability, the study utilises a range of econometric techniques from panel logit regression to quasi-experimental design based difference in difference regressions to assess the association between health shocks, medical insurance and household vulnerability. Findings The main finding of the study is that a significant proportion of households in the upper income quintile utilise private healthcare even when not covered by private medical insurance. This preference for private over public health facilities make them vulnerable to health shocks as they cope by sacrificing food consumption to incur additional health expenditure. In contrast, lower income households that are unable to access the high-cost private healthcare tend to rely on the strained public healthcare system. They are not able to use their constrained food expenditure as a coping strategy for private or out-of-pocket medical expenses because their food consumption is already at a bare minimum. Conclusion The results confirm that access to quality healthcare is a privilege in South Africa, available only to the minority of the population. The study paints a grim picture of household vulnerability in South Africa and underlines the need for a National Health Insurance that would enable universal access to quality healthcare in the country."

However, the underlying pathological and molecular mechanisms, and effective treatment, have not been fully elucidated. Herein, we investigated the effect of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, linagliptin, on diabetes-related cognitive impairment. Method Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were treated with linagliptin (3 mg/kg/24 h) for 17 weeks. The radial arm water maze test was performed, followed by evaluation of oxidative stress using DNP-MRI and the expression of NAD(P)H oxidase components and proinflammatory cytokines and of microglial activity. Results Administration of linagliptin did not affect the plasma glucose and body weight of diabetic mice; however, it improved cognitive impairment. Additionally, linagliptin reduced oxidative stress and the mRNA expression of NAD(P)H oxidase component and TNF-α, and the number and body area of microglia, all of which were significantly increased in diabetic mice. Conclusions Linagliptin may have a beneficial effect on diabetes-related dementia by inhibiting oxidative stress and microglial activation, independently of glucose-lowering."
https://openalex.org/W3005390319,"Statins, the most prescribed class of drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, can cause muscle-related adverse effects. It has been shown that the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) plays a key role in the anti-myogenic action of dexamethasone. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the role of GILZ in statin-induced myopathy. Statins induced GILZ expression in C2C12 cells, primary murine myoblasts/myotubes, primary human myoblasts, and in vivo in zebrafish embryos and human quadriceps femoris muscle. Gilz induction was mediated by FOXO3 activation and binding to the Gilz promoter, and could be reversed by the addition of geranylgeranyl, but not farnesyl, pyrophosphate. Atorvastatin decreased Akt phosphorylation and increased cleaved caspase-3 levels in myoblasts. This effect was reversed in myoblasts from GILZ knockout mice. Similarly, myofibers isolated from knockout animals were more resistant toward statin-induced cell death than their wild-type counterparts. Statins also impaired myoblast differentiation, and this effect was accompanied by GILZ induction. The in vivo relevance of our findings was supported by the observation that gilz overexpression in zebrafish embryos led to impaired embryonic muscle development. Taken together, our data point toward GILZ as an essential mediator of the molecular mechanisms leading to statin-induced muscle damage."
https://openalex.org/W3004479057,"Introduction Stunting continues to be a public health challenge with grave health, cognitive and economic consequences. Yet, its dynamics along the life course remain not well investigated in Ethiopia and beyond. Methods Longitudinal data generated by following two (younger and older) cohorts of about 3000 children for nearly 15 years were analyzed to investigate the longitudinal dynamics of stunting in Ethiopia. The cross-sectional prevalence of stunting in each round, longitudinal prevalence, and transition probabilities were determined. Multilevel mixed effects ordinal regression was applied to identify the determinants of stunting accounting for child-level and cluster-level variations. Results The cross-sectional prevalence of severe stunting for the younger cohort fluctuated between 21% and 6%, while for the older cohort it fluctuated between 12% and 3%. Moderate stunting fluctuated between 23% and 16% for the younger cohort and between 22% and 8% for the older cohort. The longitudinal prevalence of severe stunting was 10% in both the younger and older cohorts, whereas that of moderate stunting was 20% for the younger cohort and 18% for the older cohort. Children not stunted at baseline had very high probabilities of remaining not stunted through youthhood (87% for the younger and 90% for the older cohorts). Conversely, children with moderate stunting at baseline had high probabilities either remaining moderately stunted or progressing to severe stunting. Furthermore, children who had severe stunting at baseline had high probabilities of either remaining severely stunted or transitioning to moderate stunting. In both cohorts, older age of the child, female sex, having an educated mother, and being from a household with educated head significantly reduced the risk of stunting. Children from households in the top wealth tertile had a significantly lower risk of stunting in the younger cohort, but not in the older cohort. Similarly, Productive Safety Net Programme reduced the risk of stunting in the younger cohort, but not in the older cohort. Conclusion Children not stunted early in life are highly likely to grow into non-stunted adults while children stunted early in life are highly likely to grow into stunted adults. Several child-level, maternal, household and programmatic factors affect the risk of stunting. Efforts to prevent stunting shall commence early in life."

Here, we report that weight cycling induced by alternating feeding mice with a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet in a 1-week switch protocol caused further increased epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) weight, preadipocyte proliferation, hepatic inflammation, fasting blood glucose level, and glucose intolerance, compared with the continuously HF-fed mice. Combining the secretory protein database with RNA-sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) results in eWAT, the mRNA levels of several adipokines, including Retn (encoding resistin), were found altered by weight cycling. A transcriptional co-factor Lmo4 was found regulated by weight cycling; Lmo4 enhanced preadipocyte proliferation, in vitro adipogenesis, transcription of Retn, and resistin secretion in 3T3-L1 cells. Primary mouse hepatocytes administrated with recombinant mouse resistin (rm-resistin), or exposed to media from Lmo4-overexpressed 3T3-L1 cells, showed increased inflammatory responses and gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, rm-resistin-injected normal chow-fed mice showed upregulated blood glucose level by increasing gluconeogenesis, and upregulated the hepatic inflammatory responses. Together, our results suggest a regulatory role of Lmo4-resistin signaling in weight cycling, indicating a crosstalk between the adipose tissue and liver."
https://openalex.org/W3004731802,"Recent research shows significant economic benefit if the processing sweet corn [Zea mays L. var. rugosa (or saccharata)] industry grew crowding stress tolerant (CST) hybrids at their optimum plant densities, which may exceed current plant densities by up to 14,500 plants ha-1. However, optimum plant density of individual fields varies over years and across the Upper Midwest (Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin), where processing sweet corn is concentrated. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the extent to which environmental and management practices affect optimum plant density and, (2) identify the most appropriate recommendation domain for making decisions on plant density. To capture spatial and temporal variability in optimum plant density, on-farm experiments were conducted at thirty fields across the states of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin, from 2013 to 2017. Exploratory factor analysis of twelve environmental and management variables revealed two factors, one related to growing period and the other defining soil type, which explained the maximum variability observed across all the fields. These factors were then used to quantify the strength of associations with optimum plant density. Pearson’s partial correlation coefficients of ‘growing period’ and ‘soil type’ with optimum plant density were low (ρ1 = -0.14 and ρ2 = -0.09, respectively) and non-significant (P = 0.47 and 0.65, respectively). To address the second objective, six candidate recommendation domain models (RDM) were developed and tested. Linear mixed effects models describing crop response to plant density were fit to each level of each candidate RDM. The difference in profitability observed at the current plant density for a field and the optimum plant density under RDM level represented the additional processor profit ($ ha-1) from a field. The RDM built around ‘Production Area’ (RDMPA) appears most suitable, because plant density recommendations based on RDMPA maximized processor profits as well grower returns better than other RDMs. Compared to current plant density, processor profits and grower returns increased by $448 ha-1 and $82 ha-1, respectively at plant densities under RDMPA."
https://openalex.org/W3005036625,"The association of thyrotropin (TSH) with overall (body mass index, BMI), visceral (waist circumference and steatosis), and upper subcutaneous (neck circumference, NC) adiposity markers is still controversial, and the aim of this study is to assess these associations in the baseline data of a large cohort from ELSA-Brasil.This cross-sectional study included 11,224 participants with normal thyroid function (normal TSH levels). BMI, waist circumference, NC and steatosis, defined by hepatic attenuation (mild or moderate/severe) were the explicative variables. TSH levels were log transformed (logTSH), and multivariate linear regression models were generated to estimate the associations between logTSH and BMI (continuous and categorized), waist circumference, NC, and steatosis after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and comorbidities. The mean age was 51.5±8.9 years, 5,793 (51.6%) participants were women, 21.8% (n = 2,444) were obese, and 15.1% of the sample was TPOAb positive. The TSH levels were significantly higher in the obese group than in the reference group (<25.0 kg/m2). In the multivariable linear regression models, significant associations of logTSH with BMI and obesity were found. LogTSH was associated with waist circumference only among women. NC and steatosis were not related to TSH levels.TSH levels were associated with overall adiposity and obesity. Further studies may elucidate reference levels of TSH according to BMI status."
https://openalex.org/W3005439947,"Synovial inflammation is a central feature of osteoarthritis (OA), elicited when local regulatory macrophages (M2-like) become overwhelmed, activating an inflammatory response (M1-like). Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNC) are a source of naive macrophages capable of reducing joint inflammation and producing molecules essential for cartilage metabolism. This study investigated the response of BMNC to normal (SF) and inflamed synovial fluid (ISF). Equine BMNC cultured in autologous SF or ISF (n = 8 horses) developed into macrophage-rich cultures with phenotypes similar to cells native to normal SF and became more confluent in ISF (~100%) than SF (~25%). BMNC cultured in SF or ISF were neither M1- nor M2-like, but exhibited aspects of both phenotypes and a regulatory immune response, characterized by increasing counts of IL-10+ macrophages, decreasing IL-1β concentrations and progressively increasing IL-10 and IGF-1 concentrations. Changes were more marked in ISF and suggest that homeostatic mechanisms were preserved over time and were potentially favored by progressive cell proliferation. Collectively, our data suggest that intra-articular BMNC could increase synovial macrophage counts, potentiating the macrophage- and IL-10-associated mechanisms of joint homeostasis lost during the progression of OA, preserving the production of cytokines involved in tissue repair (PGE2 , IL-10) generally impaired by frequently used corticosteroids."
https://openalex.org/W3004596066,"The synaptic vesicle protein, synaptotagmin, is the principle Ca2+ sensor for synaptic transmission. Ca2+ influx into active nerve terminals is translated into neurotransmitter release by Ca2+ binding to synaptotagmin’s tandem C2 domains, triggering the fast, synchronous fusion of multiple synaptic vesicles. Two hydrophobic residues, shown to mediate Ca2+-dependent membrane insertion of these C2 domains, are required for this process. Previous research suggested that one of its tandem C2 domains (C2B) is critical for fusion, while the other domain (C2A) plays only a facilitatory role. However, the function of the two hydrophobic residues in C2A have not been adequately tested in vivo. Here we show that these two hydrophobic residues are absolutely required for synaptotagmin to trigger vesicle fusion. Using in vivo electrophysiological recording at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction, we found that mutation of these two key C2A hydrophobic residues almost completely abolished neurotransmitter release. Significantly, mutation of both hydrophobic residues resulted in more severe deficits than those seen in synaptotagmin null mutants. Thus, we report the most severe phenotype of a C2A mutation to date, demonstrating that the C2A domain is absolutely essential for synaptotagmin’s function as the electrostatic switch."
https://openalex.org/W3005165634,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a group of breast cancer with heterogeneity and poor prognosis and effective therapeutic targets are not available currently. TNBC has been recognized as estrogen-independent breast cancer, while the novel estrogen receptor, namely G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), was claimed to mediate estrogenic actions in TNBC tissues and cell lines. Through mRNA microarrays, lncRNA microarrays, and bioinformatics analysis, we found that GPER is activated by 17β-estradiol (E2) and GPER-specific agonist G1, which downregulates a novel lncRNA (termed as lncRNA-Glu). LncRNA-Glu can inhibit glutamate transport activity and transcriptional activity of its target gene VGLUT2 via specific binding. GPER-mediated reduction of lncRNA-Glu promotes glutamate transport activity and transcriptional activity of VGLUT2. Furthermore, GPER-mediated activation of cAMP-PKA signaling contributes to glutamate secretion. LncRNA-Glu-VGLUT2 signaling synergizes with cAMP-PKA signaling to increase autologous glutamate secretion in TNBC cells, which activates glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and its downstream CaMK and MEK-MAPK pathways, thus enhancing cellular invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide new insights into GPER-mediated glutamate secretion and its downstream signaling NMDAR-CaMK/MEK-MAPK during TNBC invasion. The mechanisms we discovered may provide new targets for clinical therapy of TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W3004895911,"Understanding the mechanisms regulating mitochondrial respiratory function and adaptations to metabolic challenges, such as exercise and high dietary fat, is necessary to promote skeletal muscle health and attenuate metabolic disease. Autophagy is a constitutively active degradation pathway that promotes mitochondrial turnover and transiently increases postexercise. Recent evidence indicates Bcl2 mediates exercise-induced autophagy and skeletal muscle adaptions to training during high-fat diet. We determined if improvements in mitochondrial respiration due to exercise training required Bcl2-mediated autophagy using a transgenic mouse model of impaired inducible autophagy (Bcl2AAA ). Mitochondrial adaptations to a treadmill exercise training protocol, in either low-fat or high-fat diet fed mice, did not require Bcl2-mediated autophagy activation. Instead, training increased protein synthesis rates and basal autophagy in the Bcl2AAA mice, while acute exercise activated BNIP3 and Parkin autophagy. High-fat diet stimulated lipid-specific mitochondrial adaptations. These data demonstrate increases in basal mitochondrial turnover, not transient activation with exercise, mediate adaptations to exercise and high-fat diet."
https://openalex.org/W3005377812,"Chewing is a rhythmic oral behavior that requires constant modifications of jaw movements in response to changes in food properties. The food-specific kinematic response is dependent on the potential for kinematic flexibility allowed by morphology and modulation of motor control. This study investigates the effects of food toughness and stiffness on the amplitude and variability of jaw movements during chewing in a typical omnivorous mammalian model (pigs). Jaw movements were reconstructed using X-ray Reconstruction Of Moving Morphology (XROMM) and kinematic data associated with the amplitude of jaw pitch (opening-closing) and jaw yaw (mediolateral rotation) were extracted for each cycle. Between-food differences were tested for the amplitude of jaw movements during each phase of the gape cycle, as well as in their respective within-food variability, or stereotypy, as indicated by coefficients of variation. With increasing toughness, jaw pitch amplitude is decreased during fast close, larger and more stereotyped during slow close, smaller but more variable during slow open, and more variable during fast open. In addition, when chewing on tougher foods, the amplitude of jaw yaw during slow close only increases in a subset of individuals, but all become less variable (i.e., more stereotyped). In contrast, increasing food stiffness has no effect on the amplitude or the variability of jaw pitch, whereas jaw yaw increases significantly in the majority of individuals studied. Our data demonstrate that food stiffness and toughness both play a role in modulating gape cycle dynamics by altering the trajectory of jaw movements, especially during the slow-close phase and tooth-food-tooth contact, albeit differently. This highlights how a generalist oral morphology such as that of pigs (e.g., bunodont teeth lacking precise occlusion, permissive temporomandibular joint allowing extensive condylar displacements in 3 dimensions) enables organisms to not only adjust chewing movements in their amplitude, but also in their variability."
https://openalex.org/W3004521115,"As reef-building corals are increasingly being exposed to persistent threats that operate on both regional and global scales, there is a pressing need to better understand the complex processes that diminish coral populations. This study investigated the impacts of the Florida red tide dinoflagellate Karenia brevis and associated brevetoxins on selected facets of coral biology using Porites astreoides as a model system. When provided with choice assays, P. astreoides larvae were shown to actively avoid seawater containing red tide (5×105 cells L-1–7.6×106 cells L-1) or purified brevetoxins (0.018 μg mL-1 brevetoxin-2 and 0.0018 μg mL-1 brevetoxin-3). However, forced exposure to similar treatments induced time-dependent physiological and behavioral changes that were captured by PAM fluorometry and settlement and survival assays, respectively. Adult fragments of P. astreoides exposed to red tide or associated brevetoxins displayed signs of proteomic alterations that were characterized by the use of an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis. The novel use of this technique with P. astreoides demonstrated that protein regulation was highly contingent upon biological versus chemical treatment (i.e. live K. brevis vs. solely brevetoxin exposure) and that several broad pathways associated with cell stress were affected including redox homeostasis, protein folding, energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species production. The results herein provide new insight into the ecology, behavior and sublethal stress of reef-building corals in response to K. brevis exposure and underscore the importance of recognizing the potential of red tide to act as a regional stressor to these important foundation species."
https://openalex.org/W3004932352,"Molecular clustering at the plasma membrane has long been identified as a key process and is associated with regulating signalling pathways across cell types. Recent advances in microscopy, in particular the rise of super-resolution, have allowed the experimental observation of nanoscale molecular clusters in the plasma membrane. However, modelling approaches capable of recapitulating these observations are in their infancy, partly because of the extremely complex array of biophysical factors which influence molecular distributions and dynamics in the plasma membrane. We propose here a highly abstracted approach: an agent-based model dedicated to the study of molecular aggregation at the plasma membrane. We show that when molecules are modelled as though they can act (diffuse) in a manner which is influenced by their molecular neighbourhood, many of the distributions observed in cells can be recapitulated, even though such sensing and response is not possible for real membrane molecules. As such, agent-based offers a unique platform which may lead to a new understanding of how molecular clustering in extremely complex molecular environments can be abstracted, simulated and interpreted using simple rules."
https://openalex.org/W3005300512,"Background Appropriate collaboration between health professionals (HP) can reduce medical errors, enhance the spread of critical information, and assist in interpretation of health information resulting in improved patient care. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) may provide a useful conceptual framework to facilitate better interprofessional practice. Purpose To determine whether a training programme based on the ICF framework resulted in improved interprofessional behaviour among HPs in Rwanda. Methodology A cluster randomised control trial was used. Four district hospitals were randomly allocated to receive either a day’s training in interprofessional practice based on the ICF framework (experimental) or a short talk and a booklet on the topic (control). A total of 203 participants included medical doctors, nurses, and other HPs took part in this study. Simple random sampling was used to select the hospital records of 200 patients discharged from relevant wards at both the experimental and control hospitals at baseline and at two, four and six months after training (800 patients’ records from each group). A self-designed checklist has undergone some validation and was based on the ICF conceptual model was used to audit the quality of information included in the patients’ records. Ethical approval was obtained from the relevant authorities. Results The demographic and medical profile of the patients in the two sets was equivalent. An ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey test indicated the mean number of items correctly filled in was not significant at baseline (p = 0.424) but the difference was significant (p < .001) for the post-intervention scores at two, four and six months. The control group scores did not improve over time. The improved behavior was still evident at six months although it had begun to decay. Conclusion Behaviour change as evidenced by more comprehensive recording of patient management can result from a well-structured training programme. The ICF appeared to provide a common language and facilitate HPs interaction and patient management plans. Implication The ICF provided an effective conceptual framework to structure the content of the training and the audit tool. It is recommended that the framework be used to facilitate interprofessional education and practice in Rwanda and that the training approach may be applicable to other health care contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3005216781,"The importance of fatty acids (FAs) for healthy brain development and function has become more evident in the past decades. However, most studies focus on the hypothalamus as an important FA-sensing brain region involved in energy homeostasis. Less work has been done to evaluate the effects of FAs on brain regions such as the hippocampus or cortex, two important centres of learning, memory formation, and cognition. Furthermore, the mechanisms of how FAs modulate the neuronal development and function are incompletely understood. Therefore, this study examined the effects of the saturated FA palmitic acid (PA) and the polyunsaturated FA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on primary hippocampal and cortical cultures isolated from P0/P1 Sprague Dawley rat pups. Exposure to PA, but not DHA, resulted in severe morphological changes in primary neurons such as cell body swelling, axonal and dendritic blebbing, and a reduction in synaptic innervation, compromising healthy cell function and excitability. Pharmacological assessment revealed that the PA-mediated alterations were caused by overactivation of neuronal insulin signaling, demonstrated by insulin stimulation and phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition. Remarkably, co-exposure to DHA prevented all PA-induced morphological changes. This work provides new insights into how FAs can affect the cytoskeletal rearrangements and neuronal function via modulation of insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3004814656,"The Mediterranean Basin is a biodiversity hotspot, where islands play a key role because of their high biological diversity, degree of endemicity and human pressure. One of these islands, Sardinia, is a good evolutionary laboratory, especially for the study of complex genera, such as Centaurea. In particular, endemic species of Centaurea sect. Centaurea from Sardinia provides an interesting case study of plant evolution on continental islands. We attempted to clarify the processes leading to the diversification of Centaurea species on Sardinia using bi-parentally inherited nuclear markers and maternally inherited plastid markers. Our plastid results revealed the presence of five lineages of sect. Centaurea on the island. Three of them were defined as three species: C. ferulacea, C. filiformis and C. horrida. The other two lineages highlighted the complex evolutionary history of the two polyploids C. corensis and C. magistrorum. Multiple colonization events from the mainland involving the C. deusta and C. paniculata lineages among others, have led to the diversity of sect. Centaurea on Sardinia. One colonization event likely followed a southern path via the land connection between the mainland, the Calabrian Plate and Sardinia. A second pathway likely followed a northern connection, probably through the Tuscan Archipelago. Implications of these findings on conservation efforts for Centaurea endemics on Sardinia are also discussed."

This study compared the effects of aerobic training with different intensities but equivalent volume upon microvascular reactivity in cremaster muscle and myocardial biomarkers of oxidative stress in Wistar rats. After peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) assessment, rats (n = 24) were assigned into three groups: moderate-intensity exercise training (MI); high-intensity exercise training (HI); sedentary control (SC). Treadmill training occurred during 4 weeks, with exercise bouts matched by the energy expenditure (3.0–3.5 Kcal). Microvascular reactivity was assessed in vivo by intravital microscopy in cremaster muscle arterioles, while biomarkers of oxidative stress and eNOS expression were quantified at left ventricle and at aorta, respectively. Similar increasing vs. sedentary control group (SC) occurred in moderate intensity training group (MI) and high-intensity training group (HI) for endothelium-dependent vasodilation (10-4M: MI: 168.7%, HI: 164.6% vs. SC: 146.6%, P = 0.0004). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (HI: 0.13 U/mg vs. MI: 0.09 U/mg and SC: 0.06 U/mg; P = 0.02), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (HI: 0.00038 U/mg vs. MI: 0.00034 U/mg and SC: 0.00024 U/mg; P = 0.04), and carbonyl protein content (HI: 0.04 U/mg vs. MI: 0.03 U/mg and SC: 0.01 U/mg; P = 0.003) increased only in HI. No difference across groups was detected for catalase (CAT) (P = 0.12), Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (P = 0.38) or eNOS expression in aorta (P = 0.44). In conclusion, higher exercise intensity induced greater improvements in myocardium antioxidant defenses, while gains in microvascular reactivity appeared to rely more on exercise volume than intensity."
https://openalex.org/W3004625122,"The visual photopigment protein rhodopsin (Rh) is a typical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that initiates the phototransduction cascade in retinal disk membrane of rod-photoreceptor cells. Rh molecule has a tendency to form dimer, and the dimer tends to form rows, which is suggested to heighten phototransduction efficiency in single-photon regime. In addition, the dimerization confers Rh an affinity for lipid raft, i.e. raftophilicity. However, the mechanism by which Rh-dimer raftophilicity contributes to the organization of the higher order structure remains unknown. In this study, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a disk membrane model containing unsaturated lipids, saturated lipids with cholesterol, and Rh-dimers. We described the Rh-dimers by two-dimensional particle populations where the palmitoyl moieties of each Rh exhibits raftophilicity. We simulated the structuring of Rh in a disk for two types of Rh-dimer, i.e., the most and second most stable Rh dimers, which exposes the raftophilic regions at the dimerization-interface (H1/H8 dimer) and two edges away from the interface (H4/H5 dimer), respectively. Our simulations revealed that only the H1/H8 dimer could form a row structure. A small number of raftophilic lipids recruited to and intercalated in a narrow space between H1/H8 dimers stabilize the side-by-side interaction between dimers in a row. Our results implicate that the nano-sized lipid raft domains act as a ""glue"" to organize the long row structures of Rh-dimers."
