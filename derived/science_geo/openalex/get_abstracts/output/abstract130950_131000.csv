https://openalex.org/W1995041236,"Use of amphiphilic triblock copolymers to direct the organization of polymerizing silica species has resulted in the preparation of well-ordered hexagonal mesoporous silica structures (SBA-15) with uniform pore sizes up to approximately 300 angstroms. The SBA-15 materials are synthesized in acidic media to produce highly ordered, two-dimensional hexagonal (space group p 6 mm ) silica-block copolymer mesophases. Calcination at 500°C gives porous structures with unusually large interlattice d spacings of 74.5 to 320 angstroms between the (100) planes, pore sizes from 46 to 300 angstroms, pore volume fractions up to 0.85, and silica wall thicknesses of 31 to 64 angstroms. SBA-15 can be readily prepared over a wide range of uniform pore sizes and pore wall thicknesses at low temperature (35° to 80°C), using a variety of poly(alkylene oxide) triblock copolymers and by the addition of cosolvent organic molecules. The block copolymer species can be recovered for reuse by solvent extraction with ethanol or removed by heating at 140°C for 3 hours, in both cases, yielding a product that is thermally stable in boiling water."
https://openalex.org/W2171620774,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors in the human digestive tract, but their molecular etiology and cellular origin are unknown. Sequencing of c- kit complementary DNA, which encodes a proto-oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT), from five GISTs revealed mutations in the region between the transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains. All of the corresponding mutant KIT proteins were constitutively activated without the KIT ligand, stem cell factor (SCF). Stable transfection of the mutant c- kit complementary DNAs induced malignant transformation of Ba/F3 murine lymphoid cells, suggesting that the mutations contribute to tumor development. GISTs may originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) because the development of ICCs is dependent on the SCF-KIT interaction and because, like GISTs, these cells express both KIT and CD34."

To investigate associations between plasma IGF levels and prostate cancer risk, a nested case-control study within the Physicians' Health Study was conducted on prospectively collected plasma from 152 cases and 152 controls. A strong positive association was observed between IGF-I levels and prostate cancer risk. Men in the highest quartile of IGF-I levels had a relative risk of 4.3 (95 percent confidence interval 1.8 to 10.6) compared with men in the lowest quartile. This association was independent of baseline prostate-specific antigen levels. Identification of plasma IGF-I as a predictor of prostate cancer risk may have implications for risk reduction and treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1851722589,"Mechanically challenged tissue-engineered organs, such as blood vessels, traditionally relied on synthetic or modified biological materials for structural support. In this report, we present a novel approach to tissue-engineered blood vessel (TEBV) production that is based exclusively on the use of cultured human cells, i.e., without any synthetic or exogenous biomaterials. Human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) cultured with ascorbic acid produced a cohesive cellular sheet. This sheet was placed around a tubular support to produce the media of the vessel. A similar sheet of human fibroblasts was wrapped around the media to provide the adventitia. After maturation, the tubular support was removed and endothelial cells were seeded in the lumen. This TEBV featured a well-defined, three-layered organization and numerous extracellular matrix proteins, including elastin. In this environment, SMC reexpressed desmin, a differentiation marker known to be lost under standard culture conditions. The endothelium expressed von Willebrand factor, incorporated acetylated LDL, produced PGI2, and strongly inhibited platelet adhesion in vitro. The complete vessel had a burst strength over 2000 mmHg. This is the first completely biological TEBV to display a burst strength comparable to that of human vessels. Short-term grafting experiment in a canine model demonstrated good handling and suturability characteristics. Taken together, these results suggest that this novel technique can produce completely biological vessels fulfilling the fundamental requirements for grafting: high burst strength, positive surgical handling, and a functional endothelium."

Analysis of the San Francisco Bay and Delta ecosystem revealed a large number of exotic species that dominate many habitats in terms of number of species, number of individuals and biomass, and a high and accelerating rate of invasion. These factors suggest that this may be the most invaded estuary in the world. Possible causes include a large number and variety of transport vectors, a depauperate native biota, and extensive natural and anthropogenic disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2142431039,"Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of infection, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which together account for most obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Decreased expression of leptin or of functional leptin receptors results in hyperphagia, decreased energy expenditure, and obesity. It is unclear, however, whether defective leptin-dependent signal transduction directly promotes any of the conditions that frequently complicate obesity. Abnormalities in tumor necrosis factor alpha expression have been noted in each of the above comorbid conditions, so leptin deficiency could promote these complications if leptin had immunoregulatory activity. Studies of rodents with genetic abnormalities in leptin or leptin receptors revealed obesity-related deficits in macrophage phagocytosis and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines both in vivo and in vitro. Exogenous leptin up-regulated both phagocytosis and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. These results identify an important and novel function for leptin: up-regulation of inflammatory immune responses, which may provide a common pathogenetic mechanism that contributes to several of the major complications of obesity."

Vav, a guanosine diphosphate (GDP)–guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange factor for Rac that stimulates the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, bound to and was directly controlled by substrates and products of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase. The PI 3-kinase substrate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate inhibited activation of Vav by the tyrosine kinase Lck, whereas the product phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate enhanced phosphorylation and activation of Vav by Lck. Control of Vav in response to mitogens by the products of PI 3-kinase suggests a mechanism for Ras-dependent activation of Rac."
https://openalex.org/W2082666632,"The role of experience in the development of the cerebral cortex has long been controversial. Patterned visual experience in the cat begins when the eyes open about a week after birth. Cortical maps for orientation and ocular dominance in the primary visual cortex of cats were found to be present by 2 weeks. Early pattern vision appeared unimportant because these cortical maps developed identically until nearly 3 weeks of age, whether or not the eyes were open. The naı̈ve maps were powerfully dominated by the contralateral eye, and experience was needed for responses to the other eye to become strong, a process unlikely to be strictly Hebbian. With continued visual deprivation, responses to both eyes deteriorated, with a time course parallel to the well-known critical period of cortical plasticity. The basic structure of cortical maps is therefore innate, but experience is essential for specific features of these maps, as well as for maintaining the responsiveness and selectivity of cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1574601702,"Transportan is a 27 amino acid-long peptide containing 12 functional amino acids from the amino terminus of the neuropeptide galanin and mastoparan in the carboxyl terminus, connected via a lysine. Transportan is a cell-penetrating peptide as judged by indirect immunofluorescence using N epsilon13-biotinyl-transportan. The internalization of biotinyl-transportan is energy independent and takes place efficiently at 37 degrees, 4 degrees, and 0 degrees C. Cellular uptake of transportan is probably not mediated by endocytosis, since it cannot be blocked by treating the cells with phenylarsine oxide or hyperosmolar sucrose solution and is nonsaturable. The kinetics of internalization was studied with the aid of the 125I-labeled peptide. At 37 degrees C, the maximal intracellular concentration is reached in about 20 min. The internalized transportan is protected from trypsin. The cell-penetrating ability of transportan is not restricted by cell type, but seems to be a general feature of this peptide. In Bowes' melanoma cells, transportan first localizes in the outer membrane and cytoplasmatic membrane structures. This is followed by a redistribution into the nuclear membrane and uptake into the nuclei where transportan concentrates in distinct substructures, probably the nucleoli."

https://openalex.org/W2100096634,"Rab guanosine triphosphatases regulate vesicular transport and membrane traffic within eukaryotic cells. Here, a kinesin-like protein that interacts with guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–bound forms of Rab6 was identified. This protein, termed Rabkinesin-6, was localized to the Golgi apparatus and shown to play a role in the dynamics of this organelle. The carboxyl-terminal domain of Rabkinesin-6, which contains the Rab6-interacting domain, inhibited the effects of Rab6-GTP on intracellular transport. Thus, a molecular motor is a potential effector of a Rab protein, and coordinated action between members of these two families of proteins could control membrane dynamics and directional vesicular traffic."
https://openalex.org/W2058778918,"The Son of Sevenless (Sos) proteins control receptor-mediated activation of Ras by catalyzing the exchange of guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate on Ras. The NH2-terminal region of Sos contains a Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. In COS-1 cells, the DH domain of Sos stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on Rac but not Cdc42 in vitro and in vivo. The tandem DH-PH domain of Sos (DH-PH-Sos) was defective in Rac activation but regained Rac stimulating activity when it was coexpressed with activated Ras. Ras-mediated activation of DH-PH-Sos did not require activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase but it was dependent on activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. These results reveal a potential mechanism for coupling of Ras and Rac signaling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1986991315,"Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) is a recently identified member of the CC chemokine family. MDC is not closely related to other chemokines, sharing most similarity with thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), which contains 37% identical amino acids. Both chemokines are highly expressed in the thymus, with little expression seen in other tissues. In addition, the genes for MDC and TARC are encoded by human chromosome 16. To explore this relationship in greater detail, we have more precisely localized the MDC gene to chromosome 16q13, the same position reported for the TARC gene. We have also examined the interaction of MDC with CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), recently shown to be a receptor for TARC. Using a fusion protein of MDC with secreted alkaline phosphatase, we observed high affinity binding of MDC-secreted alkaline phosphatase to CCR4-transfected L1.2 cells (K d = 0.18 nm). MDC and TARC competed for binding to CCR4, while no binding competition was observed for six other chemokines (MCP-1, MCP-3, MCP-4, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β). MDC was tested for calcium mobilization in L1.2 cells tranfected with seven different CC chemokine receptors. MDC induced a calcium flux in CCR4-transfected cells, but other receptors did not respond to MDC. TARC, which also induced calcium mobilization in CCR4 transfectants, was unable to desensitize the response to MDC. In contrast, MDC fully desensitized a subsequent response to TARC. Both MDC and TARC functioned as chemoattractants for CCR4 transfectants, confirming that MDC is also a functional ligand for CCR4. Since MDC and TARC are both expressed in the thymus, one role for these chemokines may be to attract CCR4-bearing thymocytes in the process of T cell education and differentiation.

The complexity and functions of the chemokine family have become increasingly diverse as more members have been identified and characterized. There are four subfamilies of chemokines based on the relative position of conserved cysteine residues (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev.

The largest subfamily consists of the CC chemokines, which generally induce migration of monocytes, T lymphocytes, and in some cases eosinophils, basophils, or mast cells. All chemokines mediate their activities through G protein-coupled receptors, which have a characteristic seven-transmembrane structure. These receptors are very selective and bind specific ligands with high affinity. Eight different CC chemokine receptors have been characterized to date.

Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) is a novel CC chemokine synthesized by macrophages and dendritic cells (18Godiska R. Chantry D. Raport C.J. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Leviten D. Mantovani A. Gray P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). MDC shares only limited homology with other chemokines. It is most similar to thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) (19Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), with 37% identity. As shown by tissue Northern blots, MDC also shares a very similar expression pattern with TARC, showing high levels in thymus and very low expression in other tissues. Most surprisingly, MDC and TARC are encoded by human chromosome 16 (18Godiska R. Chantry D. Raport C.J. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Leviten D. Mantovani A. Gray P.W. J. Exp.

TARC is likely to be made by dendritic cells and may aid the recruitment, activation, and development of T cells that express CCR4. Because of the similarities between MDC and TARC, a study was undertaken to determine if MDC interacts with CCR4, the receptor for TARC. We show here that MDC is a ligand for CCR4 and in fact binds with a higher affinity than TARC. A 20-kilobase pair genomic fragment containing the human MDC gene was labeled with digoxigenin by nick translation and used as a probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization of human chromosomes (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO). The labeled probe was hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Reactions were carried out in the presence of sheared human DNA in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 30 mmsodium chloride, 3 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Hybridization signals were detected by treating slides with fluoresceinated antidigoxigenin antibodies followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Initial labeling implicated a group E chromosome. A genomic probe that specifically hybridizes to the short arm of chromosome 16 was used to demonstrate cohybridization of chromosome 16 with the MDC probe. A total of 80 metaphase cells were analyzed, with 61 exhibiting specific labeling. The murine pre-B cell line L1.2 was kindly provided by Dr. Craig Gerard (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. L1.2 cells were stably transfected as described previously (13Imai T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15036-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) by electroporation with 10 μg of linearized plasmid at 260 V, 960 microfarads using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). HUT78 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 15% fetal bovine serum. The mature sequences of both MDC and TARC were chemically synthesized by Gryphon Sciences (South San Francisco, CA) using t-butyl-oxycarbonyl chemistries on a peptide synthesizer (model 430A; Applied Biosystems). Lyophilized protein was dissolved at 10 mg/ml in 4 mm HCl and immediately diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for storage at −80 °C. Recombinant MDC was expressed as a fusion protein with the secreted form of placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as described (13Imai T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15036-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), in the expression vector pcDNA3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto CA). Briefly, the coding region of MDC followed by the coding sequence for a five-amino acid linker sequence (Ser-Arg-Ser-Ser-Gly) was fused in frame to the mature coding region of SEAP. The MDC-SEAP expression plasmid was transfected into COS cells by the DEAE-dextran method (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours following transfection, the serum levels were reduced from 10 to 1%. After 3–4 days, the culture supernatants were collected, centrifuged, filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane, and stored at 4 °C. The concentration of MDC-SEAP was determined by comparison with the reported specific activity of secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (24Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and confirmed using known concentrations of TARC-SEAP (13Imai T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15036-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) as an internal reference standard. For displacement and saturation experiments, 3 × 105 cells (or 4 × 105 cells for HUT78) were incubated for 1 h at 16 °C in the presence of 0.5 nm MDC-SEAP in the presence or absence of various concentrations of chemokines in 200 μl of binding buffer (RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% BSA, and 0.02% sodium azide). Following incubation, cells were washed four times in binding buffer and lysed in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1% Triton X-100. Samples were heated at 65 °C for 15 min to inactivate cellular phosphatases, centrifuged, and stored at −20 °C until assayed. Alkaline phosphatase activity in 10 μl of sample was determined by a chemiluminescence assay using the Great Escape Detection kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The saturation binding curve was fitted (table curve 228) using the Hill equation y =a(x c)/(x c +b c ), where y is the amount of ligand bound, a is the maximum amount of ligand bound,x is the concentration of ligand, b is the concentration of ligand at which 50% of receptor sites are occupied (K D ), and c is the Hill coefficient. Binding competition curves were fitted (table curve 228) using a three-parameter logistic model described by the equationy = a/(1 + (x/b)c), where y is the amount of labeled ligand bound, a is the maximum amount of labeled ligand bound, x is the concentration of the competitive chemokine, b is the IC50, andc is a parameter that determines the slope of the curve at the IC50. Cells were suspended at 3 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were incubated with 1 μm fura-PE3-AM (Texas Fluorescence Labs) at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. After washing twice, cells were resuspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. To measure intracellular calcium, cells in 2 ml were placed in a quartz cuvette in a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B spectrofluorimeter. Fluorescence was monitored at 340 nm (excitation wavelength 1), 380 nm (excitation wavelength 2), and 510 nm (emission wavelength) every 200 ms. Cell migration was assayed using L1.2 cells transfected with CCR4 cDNA (13Imai T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Yoshie O. J. Biol.

Approximately 106 cells resuspended in 0.1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 0.5% BSA were loaded in the upper wells of a transwell chamber (3-μm pore size, Costar). Test chemokines were added to the lower wells in a volume of 0.6 ml. After 4 h at 37 °C, cells in the lower chamber were collected and counted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Values are expressed as the percentage of input cells that migrate through the filter. Untransfected L1.2 cells were used as a control. The expression of CCR4 mRNA in T cells was examined by Northern analysis. Total RNA was extracted from the T cell line HUT78 using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test “B”, Friendswood, TX). Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were obtained from human blood separated over Histopaque gradients. After separation, monocytes were removed by plastic adherence. Half of the cells were used immediately to obtain RNA (“unstimulated”) and the other half were treated with IL-2 (50 units/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) for 10 days before extracting RNA. Ten μg of total RNA was loaded per lane, fractionated on 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose as described (12Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F.

The blot was probed with a gel-purified polymerase chain reaction fragment containing the entire coding region of CCR4 (22Power C.A. Meyer A. Nemeth K. Bacon K.B. Hoogewerf A.J. Proudfoot A.E.I.

To more precisely establish the chromosomal location of the human MDC gene, fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis was performed using a 20-kilobase pair human genomic clone as a probe. An initial hybridization experiment localized the gene to the q terminus of a group E chromosome. Subsequent co-hybridization experiments with a genomic probe specific for chromosome 16 implicated the q terminus of chromosome 16. The MDC probe hybridized to a region immediately adjacent to the heterochromatic/euchromatic boundary, corresponding to band 16q13. This localization is depicted in Fig. 1. Because the TARC gene is localized in this region (20Nomiyama H. Imai T. Kusuda J. Miura R. Callen D.F. Yoshie O. Genomics. 1997; 40: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we next compared the receptor usage of MDC with TARC. Chemokines have previously been fused to SEAP to generate probes for receptor binding studies (20Nomiyama H. Imai T. Kusuda J. Miura R. Callen D.F. Yoshie O. Genomics. 1997; 40: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Luster A.D. Greenberg S.M. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). We utilized this strategy to prepare MDC as a fusion protein with SEAP. A plasmid was prepared that directed the expression of a secreted fusion protein with MDC at the amino terminus followed by the alkaline phosphatase with His6 tag. The MDC-SEAP was used as a probe to examine binding to CCR4-transfected L1.2 cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, the MDC-SEAP bound to CCR4-expressing cells in a saturable manner. This binding was to a single high affinity site with a K d of 0.18 nm, as demonstrated by Scatchard analysis (Fig.2 B). Binding of MDC-SEAP was competitively inhibited with increasing concentrations of unlabeled MDC or TARC (Fig.2 C). The IC50 for MDC was 0.65 nm, while the IC50 for TARC was 2.1 nm. This suggests that both ligands recognize a common binding site on CCR4 and that MDC has more than 3-fold higher affinity for CCR4. To examine specificity of binding to CCR4, six additional chemokines were tested for competition of MDC-SEAP binding. A 200-fold molar excess of each chemokine was tested for competition with a constant quantity of MDC-SEAP (0.5 nm), presented in Fig. 2 D. The chemokines MCP-1, MCP-3, MCP-4, RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β did not compete for binding of MDC-SEAP to CCR4. In contrast, both MDC and TARC blocked binding to CCR4 transfectants. TARC has previously been shown to signal through CCR4 by inducing calcium mobilization (13Imai T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15036-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). To determine the ability of MDC to cause signaling through chemokine receptors, we examined calcium mobilization in L1.2 cells expressing CCR1, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, or CCR7 (Fig.3). MDC did not cause calcium flux in L1.2 cells transfected with CCR1, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR5, CCR6, or CCR7, whereas each responded to its known cognate ligand. In contrast, L1.2 cells transfected with CCR4 produced a strong calcium flux when stimulated with 10 nm MDC. Similar to other G protein-coupled receptors, CCR4 was refractory to subsequent stimulation with the same concentration of MDC. MDC also completely desensitized CCR4 transfectants to subsequent TARC treatment when both were added at 10 nm. However, pretreatment with TARC did not desensitize the receptor to subsequent stimulation with MDC. The signal produced by initial TARC stimulation was of lower intensity than the primary MDC signal and the MDC signal secondary to TARC stimulation. These results further confirm that MDC is a ligand for CCR4. We next examined the ability of MDC to induce migration of CCR4-transfected L1.2 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, both MDC and TARC induced migration of CCR4-transfected L1.2 cells. Both chemokines produced classic bell-shaped migration responses with maximal migration between 1 and 10 nm. The migration for MDC was significantly higher than that for TARC. Untransfected L1.2 cells failed to migrate when treated with MDC. These chemotaxis results confirm that both MDC and TARC are functional ligands for CCR4. The human T cell line HUT78 has previously been shown to express CCR4 mRNA and to respond to TARC (13Imai T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15036-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, both MDC and TARC induced migration of this T cell line. Binding of MDC was also examined on HUT78 cells. The MDC-SEAP fusion bound to the HUT78 T cell line with high affinity and could be competed with a 200-fold molar excess of MDC, as presented in Fig.5 A. A Northern blot analysis, Fig. 5 B, confirms the expression of CCR4 in HUT78 cells and PBL. The expression of CCR4 is greatly increased when PBL are stimulated with IL-2. These experiments suggest that the MDC activation of CCR4 seen on transfectants and the HUT78 T cell line are likely to also occur on natural T cells. As demonstrated by binding studies, calcium mobilization, and chemotaxis, MDC is a potent agonist for CCR4. The high affinity binding and concentrations of MDC required for signaling are similar to other chemokine receptor-ligand interactions. MDC and TARC both bind and signal through CCR4. In addition to this similar activity, both chemokines share similar in vivo expression patterns and are closely linked on human chromosome 16. MDC and TARC share these functional similarities despite sharing only 37% amino acid identity. Consequently, MDC and TARC can be considered to comprise a distinct class of CC chemokines with unique genetic localization, receptor utilization, expression pattern, and function. Our experiments suggest that MDC is likely to act as a chemoattractant for CCR4-expressing cells including mature T lymphocytes. This prediction has been confirmed recently by other investigators. Chang and colleagues (26Chang M. McNinch J. Elias III, C. Manthey C.L. Grosshans D. Meng T. Boone T. Andrew D.P. J. Biol.

Garzino-Demo A. Markham P.D. Burns J. Brown M. Gallo R.C. DeVico A.L. Science. 1997; 278: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that MDC induces calcium mobilization in activated T cells and also acts as an human immunodeficiency virus-suppressive factor. During T cell development, immature progenitor cells undergo differentiation and expansion leading to the establishment of the major T cell lineages and the elimination of potentially autoreactive T cells (28von Boehmer H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These processes occur within the highly specialized microenvironment of the thymus. The signals regulating the directed movement of immature T cells within the thymus have yet to be determined. The abundant expression of MDC, TARC, and CCR4 in the thymus (with very little expression seen in other tissues (18Godiska R. Chantry D. Raport C.J. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Leviten D. Mantovani A.

MDC and TARC may function to attract or retain T cells in the thymus and thereby mediate their trafficking and education. To further elucidate the physiologic role of these molecules, responses on T cell subsets should be determined. The complexity of the cellular movements that need to occur during T cell development may explain the diversity of chemokine and chemokine receptor expression within the thymus.

Determining the relationships and functions of these molecules may greatly help to understand the mechanisms of T cell development and regulation. MDC may also play a role outside of the thymus in certain disease states. We have previously shown that MDC is expressed at high levels by cultured macrophages and dendritic cells (18Godiska R. Chantry D. Raport C.J. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Leviten D. Mantovani A. Gray P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). CCR4 is also expressed at high levels by activated T lymphocytes, principally of the CD4 subset (13Imai T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15036-15042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Thus, MDC may also play a role in the initiation and or triggering of the immune response by facilitating the interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells at sites of inflammation. MDC was previously shown to stimulate migration of dendritic cells and IL-2 activated natural killer cells (18Godiska R. Chantry D. Raport C.J. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Leviten D. Mantovani A. Gray P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It is not clear if this migration is mediated by CCR4, since it appears to be expressed primarily on T cells. MDC may be recognized by other chemokine receptors that are yet to be characterized. Further experiments are required to determine if TARC is also able to stimulate dendritic cell migration. By virtue of its ability to attract both T lymphocytes and dendritic cells, MDC may play a unique role in the initiation or amplification of antigen-specific immune responses.

Addition of peptide-specific anti-dynamin antibodies to the assay mixture inhibited both constitutive exocytic and clathrin-coated vesicle formation. Immunodepletion of dynamin proteins also inhibited vesicle formation, and budding efficiency was restored upon readdition of purified dynamin.

The sustained JNK activation caused by isothiocyanates was associated with apoptosis induction in various cell types. An inhibitor of the caspase/interleukin-1β-converting enzyme blocked isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis without inhibiting the JNK activation, which suggests that JNK activation by isothiocyanates is an event that is independent or upstream of the activation of caspase/interleukin-1β-converting enzyme proteases.

Many isothiocyanates are effective chemopreventive agents against carcinogen-induced cancers in experimental animals. Isothiocyanates inhibit cancer formation in various tissues such as rat lung, esophagus, mammary gland, liver, small intestine, colon, and bladder cancers (29Wattenberg L.W.

Suppl. 1995; 22: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that isothiocyanates may inhibit enzymes (e.g. cytochrome P-450 isoforms) that are required for the bioactivation of carcinogens (34Smith T.J. Guo Z. Thomas P.E.

In addition, isothiocyanates may increase the carcinogen excretion or detoxification by inducing the phase II detoxifying enzymes, including glutathioneS-transferase (GST), quinone reductase, epoxide hydrolase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (35Guo Z.

Here, we report that phenylmethyl isothiocyanate (PMITC; benzyl isothiocyanate) and phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) are capable of inducing persistent JNK activation in a dose-dependent manner. Our study indicates the involvement of JNK-mediated apoptosis in the anticarcinogenic functions of isothiocyanates. Human Jurkat T-cells (clone J.LEI) were cultured as described (28Chen Y.-R.

HeLa cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle' medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and streptomycin/penicillin. Rabbit anti-JNK1 antiserum (Ab101) was described previously (28Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar).

The caspase/interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitorZ-VAD-FK and anti-Fas antibody (CH-11) were purchased from Kamiya Biomedical Co. Phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC), PMITC, and PEITC were purchased from Fluka. Phenylpropyl isothiocyanate (PPITC), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, ionomycin, and anisomycin were purchased from Sigma. 106 cells were lysed in 50 μl of 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), and 20 mm EDTA containing 0.5% SDS. The lysate was heated at 65 °C for 10 min for inactivation of nucleases and digested with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 50 °C for 2 h. The lysate was then incubated with 0.2 mg/ml RNase A at 50 °C for 2 h. The DNA fragmentation was analyzed on a 1.8% agarose gel in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The protection assay was performed as described (40Memon S.A. Petrak D. Moreno M. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 293 cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 1.5 × 105/35-mm well. Cells were cotransfected with the pCMV-βgal plasmid encoding β-galactosidase and plasmids for control vector, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, or mutant kinases by a calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (Specialty Media), with duplicates in each transfection. After removing the transfection mixture, the cells were incubated in complete medium for 12 h for recovery and then treated with or without drugs. Cells were harvested 24 h post-treatment, washed, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffer saline (PBS). The fixed cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in staining solution (PBS (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmK4(Fe(CN)4), 10 mmK3(Fe(CN)4), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm X-gal) for 2–6 h, and then washed twice with PBS. The ratio of β-galactosidase-expressing cells (blue color) was examined with a hemocytometer. Cell survival was determined as follows: (% of blue cells in treated group/% of blue cells in untreated group) × 100%. To perform transient transfection/cell death assays, 293 cells were transfected with empty vectors or JNK1- plus ΔMEKK1-expressing plasmids (in the absence or presence of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL). Cells were collected 48 h after transfection, fixed, and stained as described above. Cell survival was determined as follows: (% of blue cells in the experimental group/% of blue cells in the control) × 100%. Whole cell lysate was prepared by suspending 5 × 106 cells in 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The cell lysates were kept on ice and vigorously vortexed every 5 min for 20 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 3 min, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Kinase assays were carried out as described (41Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.-f. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) with modifications. Endogenous JNK was precipitated by incubation with anti-JNK antiserum (Ab101) and protein A-agarose beads (Bio-Rad) in incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 50 mmglycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmNa3VO4). The precipitates were washed twice with incubation buffer, twice with LiCl buffer (500 mmLiCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), and 0.1% Triton X-100), and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.6), 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mmNa3VO4) and then mixed with 5 μg of GST-Jun-(1–79), 15 μm of ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer. The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min and then terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. The reaction mixtures were boiled and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 50 mmglycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmNa3VO4). The lysate was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody (anti-CPP32, 1:200 dilution; anti-Bcl-2, 1:500; and anti-Bcl-xL, 1:1000), washed, and blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution). The membrane was then developed in ECL reagent (Amersham Corp.) and exposed to x-ray film. Human leukemia Jurkat T-cells were treated with different concentrations of PITC, PMITC, PEITC, and PPITC. Cells were collected 2 h after treatment, and endogenous JNK activity was determined by immunocomplex kinase assays. Among the tested isothiocyanates, PMITC and PEITC induced strong JNK activation at a concentration of 5 μm, and PITC induced mild JNK induction at higher concentrations (50–100 μm). No apparent JNK activation was observed with PPITC treatment at all concentrations tested (Fig.1 A). In contrast to the JNK activation, decreases in JNK activity (in comparison with the basal levels in the untreated group) were observed in treatments with high concentrations (>50 μm) of PMITC, PEITC, and PPITC (Fig.1 A). The decreases in JNK activity in treatments with high doses of isothiocyanates may be due to the acute cytotoxicity of these drugs. Jurkat cells swelled and lost the ability to exclude trypan blue (Fig. 1 B), and the protein recovery in the treated cell lysate was significantly decreased after treatments with high doses of PMITC, PEITC, and PPITC. These phenomena indicated that the integrity of the cell membrane was lost and that the cells died by membrane disintegration and cytolysis, which is reminiscent of necrosis. However, >80% of the cells retained the ability to exclude trypan blue 24 h post-treatment with different isothiocyanates at 5 μm (Fig. 1 B). To exclude the possibility that the differential regulation of JNK by isothiocyanates is due to the selected observation at the 2-h time point, we did a time course study of JNK activation with various isothiocyanates at either 5 μm (Fig.2 A) or 50 μm(Fig. 2 B) in Jurkat T-cells. At a concentration of 5 μm, both PMITC and PEITC induced persistent JNK activation. JNK activity increased at the 1-h time point, peaked around 2–4 h post-treatment, and gradually decreased, but remained higher than basal levels even 12 h after treatment. In contrast, 5 μm PITC or PPITC failed to induce any JNK activation. At 50 μm, only PITC induced a slight JNK induction, whereas PMITC, PEITC, and PPITC decreased the basal levels of JNK activity. These results were consistent with the data in the dose-response experiment (Fig. 1 A), showing that isothiocyanates induced JNK activation in a dose-dependent manner and also revealing that PMITC and PEITC were strong JNK activators, inducing sustained JNK activation at certain concentrations. In our previous study, persistent JNK activation was associated with apoptosis induced by γ-radiation and UV-C (26Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Since most of the early apoptotic cells maintain an intact cytoplasmic membrane, trypan blue staining is not an appropriate criterion for apoptosis. Hence, a DNA fragmentation assay was used to examine if the persistent JNK activation induced by PMITC and PEITC was associated with apoptotic cell death. Cellular DNA was extracted from Jurkat cells treated with different isothiocyanates (5 μm) and analyzed for DNA fragmentation. We found that only PMITC and PEITC, which induced persistent JNK activation at 5 μm, caused chromosomal DNA laddering at 12–24 h after treatment (Fig. 2 C). This result shows the correlation between persistent activation of JNK and apoptosis induction by isothiocyanate treatments and the precedence of JNK activation to DNA fragmentation. The caspase/ICE family of proteases are known to be important apoptosis mediators (42Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar); hence, we determined if caspases/ICE-like proteases are involved in JNK-mediated apoptosis induced by isothiocyanates. PMITC- and PEITC-induced DNA fragmentation was completely inhibited by cotreatment with a caspase/ICE protease inhibitor, Z-VAD-FK (Fig.3 A). Z-VAD-FK blocked the cleavage of CPP32 (caspase 3) caused by anti-Fas treatment (Fig. 3 B), indicating that it is an effective caspase inhibitor. In contrast to the inhibition of DNA fragmentation,Z-VAD-FK did not abolish JNK activation induced by PMITC (Fig. 3 C) or PEITC (data not shown). The slight enhancement of JNK activation by Z-VAD-FK was not reproducible in repeated experiments, and therefore, was fluctuation of kinase assays. These data indicate the requirement of caspases/ICE-like proteases in isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis; however, JNK activation can occur in the absence of caspase activity. Also, in light of the fact that JNK activation occurred hours before the onset of DNA fragmentation during the isothiocyanate treatments (Fig. 2), JNK activation is unlikely to be a secondary effect of the cellular damage during apoptosis. These data suggest that JNK activation initiates apoptotic signaling. We next examined if the isothiocyanate induces persistent JNK activation and apoptosis in different cell types. We found that different concentrations of PEITC were needed to induce JNK activation in distinct cell types; the effective concentration varied from 5 to 50 μm (data not shown). 20 μm PEITC induced persistent JNK activation in HeLa and 293 cells (Fig.4 A). At the concentration that induced sustained JNK induction, PEITC also caused apoptosis (Fig.4 B). On examination after Hoechst 33258 staining, the cell nuclei were condensed and fragmented after the PEITC treatment, in comparison with the homogeneous nuclear staining of the untreated cells (Fig. 4 B). These data demonstrate that the induction of JNK activation and apoptosis by PEITC can occur in various cell types. Previously, we have shown that the JNK pathway is involved in and required for radiation-induced apoptosis (26Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Other investigators also showed that the JNK cascade is required for apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal or ceramide treatment (24Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 27Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). We then tested if interfering with the JNK pathway had a suppressive effect on isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis. 293 cells were transfected with pCMV-βgal with or without plasmids encoding a dominant-negative kinase mutant, and each transfection was duplicated for treatments with or without PEITC (20 μm). The cells were harvested 24 h after treatment and stained with X-gal to examine the β-galactosidase-expressing cells (blue in color). The survival rate of transfected cells after the drug treatment was determined as the percentage of blue cells in the treated group divided by the percentage of blue cells in the untreated group. The dominant-negative mutants of MEKK1 and JNK1 (MEKK1(KR) and JNK1(APF), respectively) blocked PEITC-induced cell death in transfected 293 cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, transfection of wild-type JNK1, a dominant-negative Raf1 mutant (Raf-BXB301), or dominant-negative p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38(AGF)) did not significantly affect apoptosis induced by PEITC. This result indicates that interfering with the JNK pathway prevents the PEITC-induced apoptosis, thereby suggesting that the JNK pathway is required for isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis. JNK activity is regulated by the upstream kinase cascade (MEKK1 → MKK4 → JNK, 3); however, it is not clear which upstream signals regulate the JNK module after cells receive apoptotic stimuli. Isothiocyanates react with GSH and form dithiocarbamates (R–NH–C(=S)–SG) in the presence or absence of GST (43Kolm R.H. Danielson U.H. Zhang Y. Talalay P. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1995; 331: 453-459Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Since apoptosis is activated by many oxidative agents (44Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 20: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (728) Google Scholar), the isothiocyanates may induce oxidative stress by reacting with and depleting the intracellular GSH pool, which may then induce JNK activation and apoptosis. We decided to test the roles of oxidation in isothiocyanate-induced JNK activation using antioxidants. JNK activation by PMITC and PEITC was inhibited by preincubation of the Jurkat cells with antioxidants, 2-mercaptoethanol (10 mm, 1 h) or N-acetylcysteine (20 mm, 2 h) (Fig. 6). The antioxidant treatments also blocked γ-radiation-induced JNK activation, but had no effect on JNK induction by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin or by anisomycin (Fig. 6). The inhibition of JNK activation is not due to the loss of viability of Jurkat cells after antioxidant treatment because >95% of the cells retained the ability to exclude trypan blue 6 h after antioxidant treatment (data not shown). These data indicate that the JNK activation in cells exposed to PMITC, PEITC, or γ-radiation may be due to the induction of oxidative stresses. In contrast, the induction of JNK by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin or by anisomycin may not be mediated through the intracellular oxidative changes. Bcl-2 family members are known to be important apoptosis regulators (45White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). We used a transient transfection/cell death protection assay to test if Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL can block apoptosis induced by isothiocyanates. The levels of the Bcl-2 (Bcl-xL) protein were examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7 A), revealing the production of transfected genes. The empty vector control group lost 40% of cells after the drug treatment. In comparison, transfection of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL prevented PEITC-induced apoptosis in most of the transfected cells (Fig. 7 A), indicating that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were capable of protecting cells from PEITC-induced apoptosis. We also examined the PEITC-induced JNK activation in 293 cells transfected with empty vector or Bcl-2-encoding plasmids. Although only 40–50% of the cells were transfected, the endogenous JNK activity induced by PEITC was evidently decreased in Bcl-2-transfected cells (Fig. 7 B). This result implicates Bcl-2 as an upstream suppressor for JNK activation by apoptotic stimuli. To further examine the molecular ordering between Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL and the JNK pathway, we cotransfected Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL with JNK1 plus constitutively active MEKK1 (ΔMEKK1) into 293 cells. The transfection of JNK1 plus ΔMEKK1 led to persistent JNK activation and caused apoptosis independent of the upstream signals (Fig. 7 C). Neither Bcl-2 nor Bcl-xL significantly affected the cell death caused by JNK1 plus ΔMEKK1, although the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were increased in the transfected cells (Fig. 7 C). In comparison to the Bcl-2- or Bcl-xL-transfected cells, the lower levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL detected in the cells cotransfected with JNK1 plus ΔMEKK may be due to the loss of transfected cells caused by apoptosis (Fig. 7 C). This result indicates that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL failed to prevent cell death induced by JNK activation; therefore, they may not be downstream of JNK in the apoptotic signaling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are upstream, but not downstream, of JNK in apoptotic signaling induced by isothiocyanates (Fig. 8). Activation of the JNK pathway has been shown to be a common phenomenon in apoptotic cell death (24Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); however, the importance of this activation seems to vary in apoptosis caused by different agents. The JNK pathway is required for apoptosis induction by growth factor withdrawal, heat shock, radiation, and ceramide (24Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 25Zanke B.W. Boudreau K. Rubie E. Winnett E. Tibbles L.A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Liu F.-F. Woodgett J.R. Curr.

Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). In contrast, JNK may not be essential for receptor-mediated apoptosis (e.g. Fas- and tumor necrosis factor-mediated apoptosis) (47Liu Z.-g. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar, 48Lenczowski J.M. Lourdes D. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate the involvement of JNK in isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis by proving that interfering with the JNK pathway suppressed isothiocyanate-induced cell death. We observed that high doses of PMITC, PEITC, and PPITC (>50 μm) caused acute cell death in the absence of JNK activation; however, the cell death resembled necrosis rather than apoptosis. This result indicates that induction of JNK activity is not a general event caused by stress during cell death, but rather it is a specific phenomenon associated with apoptotic cell death. In addition, the failure of a caspase/ICE inhibitor to block JNK activation caused by isothiocyanates indicates that JNK activation may initiate apoptotic signaling and that it is not a secondary effect of cellular damage from apoptotic cell death. However, we (26Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) and others (48Lenczowski J.M. Lourdes D. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) have shown that JNK activation in Fas-mediated apoptosis can be suppressed by a caspase/ICE inhibitor, which suggests that JNK induction could be augmented by activation of caspases/ICE-like proteases. A recent report indicates that CPP32, a caspase/ICE-like protease, is capable of cleaving D4-GDI, a GDP dissociation inhibitor of the Ras-related Rho family GTPase (49Na S. Chuang T.-H. Cunningham A. Turi T.G. Hanke J.H. Bokoch G.M. Danley D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11209-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The process of D4-GDI may irreversibly activate the Rho family G proteins, which are activators of the JNK pathway (50Teramoto H. Crepo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,51Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activation of CPP32 may lead to the enhancement of JNK activation. If this regulatory mechanism exists, it may work as a signaling circuit to amplify the apoptotic signal, but it may not be essential for Fas-mediated apoptosis. Our result indicates that oxidative stress may initiate JNK activation (Fig. 6). The anti-apoptotic regulator Bcl-2 may inhibit apoptosis by suppressing the formation or the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (52Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M. Milliman C.L.

Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL blocked apoptosis caused by PEITC, but failed to suppress apoptosis caused by overexpression of activated JNK1. In addition, a recent report showed that Bcl-2 blocks JNK activation induced by serum depletion or nerve growth factor withdrawal in PC-12 cells (54Park D.S. Stefanis L. Yan C.Y.I. Farinelli S.E.

Taken together, Bcl-2 may be an upstream suppressor of the JNK pathway acting to relieve the oxidative stress and to prevent JNK induction and the initiation of apoptotic signals (Fig. 8). The failure of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL to block cell death induced by JNK1 plus ΔMEKK1 suggests that Bcl-2 may not be downstream of JNK. However, these data do not exclude the possibility that JNK may directly or indirectly down-regulate the function of Bcl-2, therefore causing cell death. The tumor suppressor p53, which is essential for ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis (55Lowe S.W. Schmitt S.W. Smith B.A. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2760) Google Scholar), has been shown to be a substrate of JNK (56Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. Campbell D.G. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5511-5518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). p53 is a positive regulator for the expression of Bax (57Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), a counteracting molecule of Bcl-2 and a potent apoptosis inducer (58Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5851) Google Scholar). Although the exact physiological function of this p53 phosphorylation is still unclear, p53 may be a mediator for JNK-induced apoptosis. Isothiocyanates are well known for their chemopreventive effects on various carcinogens (29Wattenberg L.W. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2991-2994PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wattenberg L.W.

Previous studies attributed this anticarcinogenic property to their ability to affect the bioactivation, detoxification, and excretion of carcinogens (34Smith T.J. Guo Z. Thomas P.E. Chung F.-L. Morse M.A. Eklind K. Yang C.S. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6817-6822PubMed Google Scholar, 35Guo Z. Smith T.J. Wang E. Eklind K. Chung F.-L. Yang C.S.

Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 28: 273-280Google Scholar). Here, we show that isothiocyanates induced apoptosis by activation of the JNK pathway. We propose that isothiocyanate-mediated apoptosis may be one possible mechanism to achieve the anticarcinogenic function. Carcinogens usually cause genomic damages in the exposed cells. If the damages are limited, the cells can repair those damages and maintain normal functions. The cells that fail to repair the damages are normally eliminated by apoptosis, which prevents the propagation of genomic damages to progenitor cells. The cells with genomic damages that escape cell death are prone to develop into cancerous cells. In the presence of isothiocyanates, the cells will start the apoptosis process because of an increase in oxidative stress and JNK activity. The simultaneous or subsequent exposure to a carcinogen will trigger the cell death progression, and the damaged cells will be eliminated by apoptosis; therefore, fewer cells can survive and become cancer cells. In addition, cancer cells usually have a higher metabolic rate and generate higher levels of intracellular oxidants than normal cells. The ability of isothiocyanates alone to generate oxidative stress, activate the JNK pathway, and induce apoptosis suggests that they may have a therapeutic function in addition to their chemopreventive functions.

The eyeblink conditioning paradigm is used to describe a neural mechanism that mediates blocking. Disrupting inhibition of the inferior olive, a structure that conveys unconditioned stimulus information (airpuff) to the cerebellum prevented blocking in rabbits. Recordings of cerebellar neuronal activity show that the inferior olive input to the cerebellum becomes suppressed as learning occurs. These results suggest that the inferior olive becomes functionally inhibited by the cerebellum during conditioning, and that this negative feedback process might be the neural mechanism mediating blocking."

Optically pumped OVCSELs with an active layer composed of a thin-film organic semiconductor tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) doped with DCM laser dye produced very narrow linewidth (0.2 +/- 0.1 angstrom), high-power (3 watts) emission that could be varied in different devices from orange to red. The efficient energy transfer from Alq3 to DCM results in a threshold input energy of 300 microjoules per square centimeter.

https://openalex.org/W2065509427,"In renal cells, hypertonicity induces genes for heat shock proteins (HSP70, αB-crystallin), as well as enzymes and transporters directly involved in the metabolism and transport of protective organic osmolytes. While heat shock proteins are induced by many stresses including osmotic stress, the induction of the osmolytes genes appears to be specific to osmotic stress. These two adaptive mechanisms allow kidney cells to survive and function in the hypertonic environment that exists on routine basis in kidney medulla. In mammalian cells, hypertonicity induces three mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways: ERK (extracellular regulated kinase), JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase), and p38. ERK activation by osmotic stress is a consistent finding in many cells, but it is not essential for transcriptional regulation of mRNA for transporter of organic osmolyte betaine. While the growth of yeast cells on NaCl-supplemented medium is dependent on HOG1 pathway, it is still unclear which pathway mediates the adaptation to osmotic stress in mammalian cells. Here, we show that inhibition of p38 kinase activity, using the specific inhibitor SB203580 (4-(fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) imidazole), abolishes the hypertonicity-mediated induction of mRNAs for HSP70 and betaine transporter in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The inhibition is dose-dependent and correlates with thein situ activity of native p38 kinase, determined as MAPKAPK-2 activity in cell extracts. As reported previously, the activities of ERK-1 and -2 were not affected by SB203580, but surprisingly, inhibition of native p38 kinase activity correlates with up-regulation of native JNK-1 activity in osmotically stressed cells. p38 mRNA is induced by hypertonic stress and is attenuated with p38 kinase inhibition. We also find that thermal induction of HSP70 mRNA is not affected by p38 kinase inhibition. Such findings suggest that p38 kinase activity is essential for the induction of genes involved in the adaptation of mammalian cells to osmotic stress and that the increased activity of JNK-1 during p38 kinase inhibition is consistent with regulation of JNK-1 by p38 kinase in osmotically stressed cells. In addition, the transduction pathways mediating HSP70 mRNA induction by different stresses appear to be divergent; osmotic induction of HSP70 is p38 kinase-dependent, while thermal induction is not.

During water deprivation, the extracellular osmolality in the mammalian renal medulla can exceed 3000 mosmol/kg of H2O. While such an osmolality is incompatible with the survival of cells from other organs, kidney cells tolerate it well. The survival of kidney medullary cells in hypertonic environment is essential for the generation of the concentrating gradient, which is key for maintenance of body solute and water homeostasis. Many organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals, adapt to sustained hyperosmotic stress by accumulating osmotically active organic solutes (compatible organic osmolytes) (1Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). These compounds do not perturb cellular macromolecules and are preferentially accumulated over inorganic salts (1Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). Extracellular hyperosmolality exerted by a non-permeable solute (e.g. NaCl or raffinose, but not urea) has a hypertonic effect, i.e. it shrinks cells and increases intracellular potassium and sodium concentrations (ionic strength). There is evidence that increased intracellular ionic strength is among the initial signals for the induction of genes responsible for organic osmolytes accumulation (osmoprotective genes) (2Smardo F. Burg M.B. Garcı́a-Pérez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C776-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Uchida S. Garcı́a-Pérez A. Murphy H. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C614-C620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How the increased intracellular ionic strength ultimately induces transcription of these genes remains to be determined. The molecular mechanisms involved in this adaptive process in mammalian cells have been extensively studied in two renal epithelial cell lines, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 1The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; SB203580, 4-(fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) imidazole; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular regulated kinase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; p38 kinase, a MAPK isoform (HOG1 homologue); MAPKAPK-2, MAPK-activated protein kinase-2; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase (JNK equivalent); HOG1, high osmolarity glycerol response gene; BGT1, glycine betaine transporter 1; HSP70, heat shock protein 70; HSP25/27, heat shock protein 25/27; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MKK, MAPK kinase; kb, kilobase pair(s); PBST, phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. 1The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; SB203580, 4-(fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) imidazole; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular regulated kinase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; p38 kinase, a MAPK isoform (HOG1 homologue); MAPKAPK-2, MAPK-activated protein kinase-2; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase (JNK equivalent); HOG1, high osmolarity glycerol response gene; BGT1, glycine betaine transporter 1; HSP70, heat shock protein 70; HSP25/27, heat shock protein 25/27; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MKK, MAPK kinase; kb, kilobase pair(s); PBST, phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. and PAP-HT25 (rabbit renal papillary epithelium) (4Garcı́a-Pérez A.

In these cells, hypertonicity induces the transcription of genes that encode proteins (specific enzymes and transporters) directly involved in the metabolism and transport of organic osmolytes such as sorbitol (2Smardo F.

The induction of these genes by hypertonic stress appears to be relatively specific, since it is not produced by other stresses such as heat shock (9Sheikh-Hamad D. Garcı́a-Pérez A. Ferraris J.D. Peters E.M. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F28-F34PubMed Google Scholar). Hypertonicity also induces mRNA for heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and it is proposed that the induction of heat shock proteins during osmotic stress protects intracellular macromolecules from the harmful effects of elevated intracellular ionic strength until the cell accumulates the appropriate level of organic osmolytes (9Sheikh-Hamad D. Garcı́a-Pérez A. Ferraris J.D. Peters E.M. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F28-F34PubMed Google Scholar,10Cohen D.M. Wasserman J.C. Gullans S.R. Am. J.

Recently, it was reported that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) HOG1 and its activator (MAPK kinase), PBS2, are involved in osmosensing signal transduction pathway in yeast, and that cells that carry mutations in these genes fail to grow in medium supplemented with NaCl (11Brewster J.L. de Valoir T.

Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar). While demonstration of MAPKK and ERK activation by osmotic stress in MDCK cells has been shown (14Itoh T. Yamauchi A. Miyai A. Yokoyama K. Kamada T. Ueda N. Fujiwara Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), ERK activity does not appear to be essential for either transcriptional regulation of the betaine transporter gene (16Kwon M. Itoh T. Rim J.S. Handler J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or the stimulation of inositol uptake (17Berl T. Siriwardana G. Ao L. Butterfield L.M. Heasley L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F305-F311PubMed Google Scholar) during osmotic stress. Furthermore, despite evidence linking N-terminal Jun phosphorylation to osmosensing transduction pathway proximal to gene activation (12Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), it is unclear which MAPK transduction pathway is essential for osmotically driven gene transcription in mammalian cells. Here we show that the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 blocks the osmotically driven induction of mRNAs for HSP70 and BGT1, the betaine transporter. The effect is dose-dependent and correlates with in situ p38 kinase activity. Consistent with previous reports (18Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Genger J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol.

In addition, we find that the thermal induction of HSP70 mRNA is not dependent on the activity of p38 kinase, suggesting divergent pathways for induction of HSP70 gene by different stresses. Confluent MDCK cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), grown on polystyrene (Corning, NY) dishes were used at passages 65–78.

In some experiments, the media were made hyperosmotic by the addition of 200 mosmol of NaCl/kg of H2O (final osmolality of 515–525 mosmol/kg of H2O). All cultures were maintained in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Heat shock was induced by placing cells in 42 °C incubator for predetermined periods of time. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

Human HSP70 insert (2.3 kb) was obtained byBamHI, HindIII digestion of pAT153 (American Type Culture Collection). Human (2 kb) full-length β-actin cDNA was purchased from CLONTECH. Inserts were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Random Primed DNA labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim) for use as probes. Probes are hybridized to the blots overnight at 42 °C in a solution containing 40% formamide, 5 × SSC (0.75 m NaCl, 75 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7), 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.5% (w/v) Ficoll 400), 0.5% SDS, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10% dextran sulfate. The blots were then washed under high stringency at 65 °C as follows: for 30 min twice in 3 × SSC, 0.5% SDS; 1 h in 3 × SSC, 0.5% SDS; 30 min twice in 0.3 × SSC, 0.5% SDS. A 35-nucleotide p38-specific antisense oligonucleotide probe was designed, based on published data and used as probe. The sequence of the p38-specific probe is 5′-TGG TCT GTA CCA GGA AAC AAT GTT CTT CCA GTC AA-3′ and corresponds to bases 857–891 of human p38 kinase (19Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar) (GenBank accession no. L35264). Sequence specificity of the probe was determined using BLAST search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data bases, aided by Baylor College of Medicine Molecular Biology Computational Resource Center (MBCR) services. End-labeled oligonucleotide was hybridized to blots overnight at 42 °C in a solution as above but containing 100 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA and no formamide. These blots were then washed under high stringency at 42 °C as follows: for 30 min in 5 × SSC, 0.5% SDS; 1 h in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS; 30 min in 0.5 × SSC, 0.5% SDS; and 30 min in 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS. The BGT1 probe hybridizes in MDCK cells to 2.8- and 3.4-kb bands that behave similarly under hypertonic conditions. HSP70 and β-actin probes hybridize to 2.8- and 2.2-kb bands, respectively. Autoradiographs were prepared using X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen. Relative band intensities were determined by scanning laser densitometry (Ultroscan, LKB Biotechnology). mRNA abundance was determined relative to that of cells maintained in isotonic medium, after normalization of band intensities to β-actin bands for each respective time point. For consistency of BGT1 data analysis, the 2.8-kb bands were compared. mRNA abundance for HSP70 was determined relative to that of non-heat-stressed cells. p38 kinase activity was determined as per Pombo et al. (24Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26546-26551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Moriguchi et al. (12Moriguchi T.

Briefly, experimental medium was removed and cells were washed using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline of equal osmolality. Dishes were kept on ice, and cells were lysed in buffer containing: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin.Cell lysate was cleared of large particles by 10-min centrifugation at 15,000 ×g. After immobilizing anti-p38 kinase antibody (p38 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; p38b antibodies were a generous gift from J. Han, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) with Pansorbin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), cell lysate (100 μg of protein) was added, and p38 kinase was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitate was washed five times in lysis buffer, followed by five additional washes in kinase buffer. p38 kinase activity was determined by in vitro labeling of activating transcription factor 2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with 32P, in a buffer containing: 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 μm ATP. Following 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, kinase reaction was stopped by 2-min centrifugation at 12,000 ×g. Supernatant was suspended in Laemmli sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Gels were dried and autoradiographs taken. JNK-1 activity was determined using 1–79 N-terminal amino acids of c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as substrate and anti-JNK-1 antibodies (26Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for immunoprecipitation. For ERK-1 and -2 assay, the above procedure was used except for the following. Anti-ERK antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; the antibody cross-reacts with ERK-1 and ERK-2) were used for immunoprecipitation, protein A/G-agarose was used to immobilize the antibodies, myelin basic protein (Sigma) was used as substrate, and the reaction supernatant was resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE. MAPKAP kinase-2 activity was determined as per Krump et al.(27Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) with slight modification; cell lysate was obtained as described above. MAPKAP kinase-2 was immunoprecipitated using anti-MAPKAP kinase 2 antibodies (Stress Gen. Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to immobilize the antibody. Immunoprecipitate was suspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 μg of HSP27 substrate (Stress Gen.). Following 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by 2-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g. Supernatant was suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, and analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE. The pellet was processed for Western blotting as described below. p38 protein was quantified using a modification of the method of Laemmli et al. (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of protein were loaded and run on 12% reducing SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred at room temperature, 250 mA, onto Hybond™-ECL membrane (Amersham Life Sciences) in a buffer containing 10% methanol, 0.03% SDS, 25 mm Tris, 52 mmglycine, pH 8.3. Blots were blocked for 15 min with 5% dried milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated for 45 min at room temperature, with 1:100 (1 μg/ml) dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-p38 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), in TBST containing 5% milk. After a 15-min wash in TBST, blots were incubated with 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST buffer containing 5% milk. Protein was visualized using ECL detection system (Amersham Life Sciences) and quantified by densitometric analysis of the resultant bands. For quantitation of MAPKAPK-2, the pelete from the kinase assay (as described above) was suspended in Laemmli sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), boiled for 2 min, and run on 12% reducing SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred at room temperature, 250 mA for 1 h, onto Hybond™-ECL membrane (Amersham Life Sciences) in a buffer containing, 10% methanol, 0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris, 52 mm glycine, pH 8.3. Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% dried milk in PBST (100 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated overnight at 4 °C, with 2 μg/ml polyclonal anti-rabbit MAPKAPK-2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), in PBST containing 5% milk. After a 15-min wash in PBST, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, with 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in PBST buffer containing 5% milk. Protein was visualized using an ECL detection system (Amersham Life Sciences) and quantified by densitometric analysis of the resultant bands. As mentioned above, hypertonicity shrinks cells and increases intracellular ionic strength. The rise in intracellular ionic strength is believed to be among the initial signals for induction of osmoprotective genes (2Smardo F. Burg M.B. Garcı́a-Pérez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C776-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Uchida S. Garcı́a-Pérez A. Murphy H. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C614-C620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of p38 kinase in mediating osmotically driven transcription of these genes, MDCK cells were exposed for 16 h to hypertonic medium, in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of SB203580, a potent inhibitor of p38 kinase, and the abundance of BGT1 mRNA was measured. NaCl increases the abundance of BGT1 mRNA 8-fold above that of cells in isotonic medium (Fig.1). SB203580 attenuates the hypertonic induction of the mRNA in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 35–40 μm and complete inhibition at 100 μm. In addition to induction of osmoprotective genes, hypertonicity was shown to induce heat shock proteins αB-crystallin and HSP70 (10Cohen D.M. Wasserman J.C. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C594-C601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dasgupta S. Hohman T. Carper D. Exp. Eye. Res. 1992; 54: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether p38 kinase is involved in hypertonic induction of HSP70. Hypertonicity increases the abundance of HSP70 mRNA 6-fold above that of cells in isotonic medium (Fig.2). As seen with BGT1, hypertonic induction of HSP70 mRNA is inhibited by SB203580 with similar IC50. We conclude that p38 kinase activity is essential for hypertonic induction of BGT1 mRNA, a representative gene involved in the accumulation of compatible organic solute betaine in MDCK cells. In addition, p38 kinase activity appears to be essential for hypertonic induction of HSP70 mRNA as well. These findings suggest that p38 kinase is essential for the adaptation of kidney cells to osmotic stress, either by induction of heat shock proteins or of osmoprotective genes. This inhibition correlates with up-regulation of native JNK-1 activity. The pyridinyl imidazole compounds to which SB203580 belongs demonstrate a highly specific and potent inhibitory activity against p38 kinase. In earlier studies, these compounds showed no inhibitory activity against ERK-1 and -2, JNK, MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2), MAPKK, protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (18Jiang Y.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). In fact, the binding specificity of these compounds was utilized to identify and affinity-purify p38 kinase (19Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). Recently, a second p38 kinase, p38b, was identified (18Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Genger J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Both kinases are equally inhibited by pyridinyl imidazole and display near identical response to tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, epidermal growth factor, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, and extracellular stresses such as UV irradiation, H2O2, osmotic stress, and arsenate. Since the inhibitory effect of the emidazol compounds on p38 kinase is reversible (29Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), in vitro examination of p38 kinase activity may not reflect its in situ activity. To examine the specificity of SB203580 on the activity of p38 kinase in our system, MDCK cells were placed for 16 h in hypertonic medium in the presence of 0, 10, 25, 50, or 100 μm SB203580, and cell lysates were prepared for determination of native MAPKAPK-2 activity. p38 kinase is the only known activator of MAPKAPK-2, and the activity of MAPKAPK-2 is dependent on its phosphorylation by p38 kinase (27Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, the in vitro activity of immunoprecipitated MAPKAPK-2 reflects the in situ activity of p38 kinase. MAPKAPK-2 activity declines with increasing medium concentrations of SB203580, with an IC50 of 35–40 μm (Fig.3, A and B). The kinetics of MAPKAPK-2 activity is similar to the kinetics of hypertonic induction of HSP70 and BGT1 mRNAs in the presence of SB203580 (see Figs. 1 and 2). To exclude the possibility of change in MAPKAPK-2 or p38 kinase protein abundance, as a potential cause for the change in p38 kinase activity, Western blot analysis was performed on cell lysates. Cell treatment with SB203580 for 16 h does not affect the abundance of MAPKAPK-2 or p38 kinase pr"

To date its role in these processes is unknown. Here, we describe biochemical characteristics of the murine XRCC4 protein. XRCC4 expressed in insect cells exists primarily as a disulfide-linked homodimer, although it can also form large multimers. Recombinant XRCC4 is phosphorylated during expression in insect cells. XRCC4 phosphorylation in Sf9 cells occurs on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues.We also investigated whether XRCC4 interacts with the other factor known to be requisite for both V(D)J recombination and DSBR, the DNA-dependent protein kinase. We report that XRCC4 is an efficient in vitro substrate of DNA-PK and another unidentified serine/threonine protein kinase(s). Both DNA-PK dependent and independent phosphorylation of XRCC4 in vitro occurs only on serine and threonine residues within the COOH-terminal 130 amino acids, a region of the molecule that is not absolutely required for XRCC4's DSBR function. Finally, recombinant XRCC4 facilitates Ku binding to DNA, promoting assembly of DNA-PK and complexing with DNA-PK bound to DNA. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that XRCC4 functions as an alignment factor in the DNA-PK complex.

V(D)J recombination is the process of assembling the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments of the immunoglobulin and T cell receptor variable region genes during development of B and T lymphocytes (1Lewis S.M.

Evidence linking DNA repair activities with V(D)J recombination arose from the characterization of cells from homozygous severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice (9Bosma G.C. Custer R.P.

C.B-17 SCID mice which are immunodeficient because of defective V(D)J recombination, were shown to also be defective in repairing DSBs in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells (12Fulop G.M. Phillips R.A.

Further evidence for an overlap in the activities of V(D)J recombination and DSB repair came from the observation that radiosensitive rodent cell lines which were defective in DSB repair could not support V(D)J recombination induced by co-transfecting RAG 1 and RAG 2; whereas, radiosensitive mutants proficient in DSB rejoining were normal in this capacity (14Taccioli G.E.

DNA-PK is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase whose catalytic activity is dependent upon its association with DNA discontinuities such as DSBs (26Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 27Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of DNA-PK is an ∼460-kDa protein termed DNA-PKCS and the DNA-binding component is a heterodimer, Ku which is comprised of two polypeptides (Ku70 and Ku86). Because of its unique dependence on DNA ends and other DNA discontinuities for activation, it has been proposed that the role of DNA-PK in DNA repair is to modulate, via phosphorylation, the function and/or expression of other factors in response to DNA damage (18Hartley K.O.

This hypothesis has not been tested. The fourth factor required for both V(D)J recombination and DSBR is the product of the XRCC4 gene. This factor has no homology to known proteins and its function is unknown (28Li Z. Otevrel T. Gao Y. Cheng H.L. Seed B. Stamato T.D. Taccioli G.E. Alt F.W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) although it has recently been reported that XRCC4 interacts with DNA ligase IV (29Critchlow S.E. Bowater R.P. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 588-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,30Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X.T. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Although the functions of DNA-PK and XRCC4 in V(D)J recombination have not been elucidated, it is intuitive that their role is in the resolution of coding and signal ends generated by RAG-mediated cleavage.In both DNA-PK- and XRCC4-defective cells, low levels of rearrangements (both coding and signal joints) can be isolated (i.e.“leaky” SCID phenotype) (31Schuler W. Ruetsch N.R. Amsler M. Bosma M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Kienker L.J. Kuziel W.A. Tucker P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fine structure of these joints has provided insight into mechanistic details of V(D)J recombination. In SCID mice, rare coding joints often have large deletions and/or long P elements (palindromic sequences at the point of ligation which apparently result from internal nicking of the hairpinned coding intermediate) (31Schuler W. Ruetsch N.R. Amsler M. Bosma M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Kienker L.J. Kuziel W.A. Tucker P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that these long P elements reflect a diminution of hairpin resolution consistent with the observation that coding ends with hairpinned termini accumulate in SCID lymphocytes (33Roth D.B. Menetski J.P. Nakajima P.B. Bosma M.J. Gellert M. Cell. 1992; 70: 983-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 34Zhu C. Roth D.B. Immunity. 1995; 2: 101-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Rare coding joints isolated from XRCC4 defective cells are distinct from those found in SCID mice in that there is no evidence of extensive P nucleotides. Instead, it appears that short sequence homologies at the DNA termini contribute to the resolution of both coding and signal ends in XRCC4-deficient cells (28Li Z. Otevrel T. Gao Y. Cheng H.L. Seed B. Stamato T.D. Taccioli G.E. Alt F.W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Although homology mediated joining is often observed in coding joints, it is not observed in signal ligations (35Gu H. Forster I. Rajewsky K.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) have postulated that one function of XRCC4 may be to align free DNA ends, and in the absence of XRCC4 short sequence homologies might serve to facilitate DNA end joining.Here we report that recombinant XRCC4 and DNA-PK interact in vitro. The multimeric nature of XRCC4 suggests a model where XRCC4 functions as an alignment factor of DNA-PK bound to DNA serving to align DNA ends during DNA repair and V(D)J recombination. These data, in conjunction with the recent reports of XRCC4's interaction with DNA ligase IV (29Critchlow S.E. Bowater R.P. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 588-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 30Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X.T. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R.

We have observed, however, that recombinant proteins expressed from this vector are usually not secreted and proteins must be purified from cell lysates using Ni-NTA resin (see “Protein Purification”). Still, this vector was used as it results in consistently higher levels of recombinant protein than can be obtained with other transfer vectors. 2K. Meek, unpublished data. An additional recombinant virus encoding full-length XRCC4 but without the gP67 leader sequence was generated using the pHγ1360x transfer vector (38Hasemann C.A. Capra J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were co-transfected with linearized AcMNPV viral DNA via liposomes (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) into Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant viruses were then isolated using standard techniques. Baculovirus expression resulted in a fusion protein consisting of 10 amino acids from the gp67 leader peptide, nine histidine residues, and the murine XRCC4 polypeptide. The Ku86 and Ku70 baculoviruses were the generous gifts of Dr. J. Donald Capra (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and have been described previously (39Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Expression of XRCC4 in XR-1 CellsEcoRV/NotI fragments from the baculovirus transfer vectors encoding XRCC4 fusion proteins were subcloned into theNotI and SmaI sites in the cloning cassette of plasmid pcDNAI. Resulting plasmids were co-transfected with the pNeo plasmid into the XR-1 Chinese hamster ovary mutant cell line which is defective in XRCC4 with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's conditions (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Stable lines were established by G418 selection.Assessment of Irradiation Sensitivity2 × 103 cells suspended in 2 ml of complete media were exposed to various amounts of ionizing radiation using a137Ce source calibrated at 558.8 R/min. Immediately after irradiation, cells were seeded in 20 ml of complete media containing 10% fetal calf serum in 150-mm2 tissue culture dishes. After 7 days, cell colonies were fixed with 2% formaldehyde followed by 100% methanol. Subsequently, the colonies were stained with trypan blue and colony numbers were assessed. Irradiation sensitivities were assessed in triplicate and are presented as percent surviving fraction based on plating efficiencies of non-irradiated controls.Protein PurificationFor protein purification, Sf9 cells which had been infected ∼60 h earlier were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Typically, 2 × 108infected cells were prepared at a time. Cell pellets were frozen and thawed three times in liquid nitrogen in 10 ml of the following buffer: 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 8,000 ×g. Lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and the resin washed 3 times in the same buffer with the addition of 50 mmimidazole. Soluble recombinant XRCC4 protein was eluted from the resin in 0.5 ml of the same buffer with 500 mm imidazole three times. The three eluted fractions were pooled and then dialyzed against 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol at 4 °C. Dialyzed material was aliquotted and stored at −70 °C. 10 μl of lysates, beads, and eluate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The results depicted were typical for virus XRCC4HIS and for ΔC2. Purification of the other recombinant proteins described here consistently resulted in much lower protein yields. Because of the low yields from viruses ΔN, ΔC1, and ΔNΔC1, contaminating Sf9 proteins comprised a larger percentage of the total protein than with viruses XRCC4HIS or ΔC2. For this reason, control Ni+preparations of wild type-infected Sf9 cells were also prepared and used as controls in kinase assays (Fig. 5) and EMSA assays (not shown).Figure 5Localization of XRCC4HISphosphorylation sites. 400 ng of truncated (indicated ΔN (lanes 5 and 6), ΔC1 (lanes 7 and 8), ΔC2 (lanes 9 and 10), and ΔNΔC1, (lanes 11 and 12)) and full-length versions (indicated XRCC4HIS (lanes 3 and4)) of purified XRCC4HIS were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and 300 ng of purified DNA-PK with (+) and without (−) linearized plasmid DNA as described under “Materials and Methods.” A Ni+ fractionation of wild type-infected Sf9 cells (indicated WT (lanes 1 and 2)) is included as a control for proteins contaminating the recombinant XRCC4HIS preparations. Samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE (lanes 1–6) or 12% SDS-PAGE (lanes 7–12).

Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The mixtures were incubated with 37.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at room temperature, then mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol. In assays utilizing truncated forms of XRCC4, 400 ng of each recombinant protein was incubated with 300 ng of DNA-PK. Samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels and run at 200 volts for 45 min. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. In some assays, wortmannin was included at a final concentration of 500 nm.c-Jun assayApproximately 300 ng of purified DNA-PK (Promega, Madison, WI) was incubated in the presence of 10 μg of bovine serum albumin and 2 μl of DNA-PK reaction premix (13 mm spermidine and 4 mm MgCl2dissolved in 0.05 × phosphate-buffered saline) with 1 μg of purified rhAP1 (c-Jun, Promega, Madison, WI), 2 μl of 2.5 mm ATP, 0.5 μl (6000 Ci/mmol; DuPont) [γ-32P]ATP, with or without 1 μg of purified XRCC4 and with or without 100 ng of linearized plasmid DNA. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, then mixed with equal volumes of 2 × SDS-PAGE buffer. Samples were loaded onto an SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel and run at 200 volts for 45 min. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film.DNA-PK Pulldown AssayThe “DNA-PK pulldown assay” was performed essentially as described by Finnie et al. (24Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) using the 0176 normal equine fibroblast and 1863 SCID equine fibroblast cell lines (40Wiler R. Leber R. Moore B.B. VanDyk L.F.

Briefly, cell pellets (1 × 107) were resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer and then frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 37 °C three times. The extract was microcentrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 7 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was frozen at −70 °C. Extracts containing ∼7 mg of protein were absorbed onto DNA-cellulose beads and washed. 400 ng of XRCC4 was added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation, an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and the phosphorylated proteins were analyzed on SDS-8% polyacrylamide gels.Phosphoamino Acid AnalysisKinase assays were performed as above. Following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper and exposed to film. Small strips of polyvinylidene difluoride paper which corresponded to bands of interest on the autoradiograph were excised and wet in methanol for 30 s and 1 min in water. The samples were incubated in 200 μl of 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1–2 h and dried overnight. Pellets were counted in a scintillation counter and resuspended in acid (2.2% formic acid, 7.8% acetic acid) to a concentration of 2000 cpm/μl. 2 μl each of phosphoserine, threonine, and tyrosine standards (1 mg/ml) were mixed with 1 μl of sample and spotted onto a thin layer chromatography plate. The plate was then electrophoresed at 1200 volts constant voltage at 4 °C for 65 min. The plate was dried, sprayed with 0.3% ninhydrin in acetone, and exposed to film.Metabolic Labeling of Baculovirus-infected CellsSf9 cells were infected with either wild type baculovirus or recombinant baculoviruses in SF900 serum-free media (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After 24 h, the media was replaced with Grace's insect media containing [32P]orthophosphate (200 mCi/ml). Cells were harvested 24 h later. Metabolically labeled XRCC4 was affinity purified by Ni+ chromatography as described above.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)EMSAs were done by the method of Landolfi et al. (41Landolfi N.F. Capra J.D. Tucker P.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Binding reactions were done in 0.5 × buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) instead of buffer D, no nonspecific competitor was added, and bovine serum albumin was included at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. The probe was a double strand oligonucleotide that included a 12-base pair spacer V(D)J recombination signal sequence and had the following sequence: 5′-GATCTGGCCTGTCTTACACAGTGCTACAGACTGGAACAAAAACCCTGCAG-3′ (8McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C.

Completely analogous results were obtained with a second unrelated oligonucleotide probe derived from a T cell receptor Vγ promoter. Binding reactions were assembled on ice and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For EMSAs examining the ability of XRCC4 to bind DNA directly or to affect Ku binding to DNA, 5 μg of purified XRCC4 was used without or with 1, 5, or 10 μg of baculovirus-expressed Ku purified by absorption to DNA-cellulose (39Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Ku antisera was the generous gift of Dr. J. Donald Capra (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). For EMSAs examining DNA-PK assembly, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, or 0.25 μg of purified full-length XRCC4 fusion protein or purified ΔC2 were incubated with 60 ng of DNA-PK (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 4% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have biochemically characterized the murine XRCC4 gene product. XRCC4 produced in insect cells is extensively post-translationally modified both by phosphorylation and cross-linking. The protein is not glycosylated via asparagine linkages and preliminary evidence suggests that XRCC4 lacks O-linked sugar modifications as well. XRCC4 exists primarily as homodimers, but it can also multimerize into multimers via disulfide linkages. Examination of XRCC4 in native polyacrylamide gels suggests that the protein exists primarily as dimers and tetramers. XRCC4 expressed in insect cells is constitutively phosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues.XRCC4 is an efficient in vitro substrate for the DNA-dependent kinase. However, extracts from several cell lines which are completely deficient in the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK are also capable of phosphorylating XRCC4 in vitro. Thus,in vitro, XRCC4 can be modified via phosphorylation on serine and threonine by at least two different kinases. Phosphorylation by DNA-PK does not occur on a SQ consensus DNA-PK site, and is most likely located within the carboxyl-terminal 130 amino acids. Finally, it is unlikely that phosphorylation is requisite for the DSBR activity of XRCC4 in that the XRCC4 truncation spanning amino acids 1–204, which is not phosphorylated in vitro or in Sf9 cells, significantly reverses the XR-1 DSBR defect.XRCC4 facilitates binding of Ku to free DNA ends without altering mobility of Ku·DNA complexes. This is reminiscent of the recently defined JAB1 factor which increases c-jun's avidity for AP1 sites without forming a stable complex with c-jun and its target sequence (45Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). More interestingly, the association of DNA-PKCS with DNA-bound Ku is facilitated by XRCC4. This may be because of enhanced binding of Ku to DNA but could also be a direct effect of XRCC4 on DNA-PKCS. Additionally, XRCC4 can apparently form stable complexes with DNA-PK bound to DNA in vitro. Finally, a truncated form of XRCC4 which cannot functionally complement the XRCC4 defect in XR-1 cells, essentially lacks the capacity to enhance DNA-PK assembly and to form complexes with DNA-PK and DNA in vitro. Thus, the ability of XRCC4 to directly interact with DNA-PK may be functionally germane.It has been demonstrated that maximal DNA-PK activity requires approximately equal ratios of Ku and DNA-PKCS (46Morozov V.E. Falzon M. Anderson C.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16684-16688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Albeit it is speculation at this point, the dimeric nature of XRCC4 might suggest that XRCC4 could interact with two separate DNA-PK complexes, possibly stabilizing or aligning the two DNA strands by bridging two DNA-PK complexes prior to ligation. Another possibility is that tetramers of XRCC4 might stabilize 4 units of DNA-PK in the V(D)J recombination complex. The fact that rare coding and signal joints in XR-1 cells likely utilize (and possibly require) short sequence homologies to facilitate ligation, may reflect an inability in these cells to stabilize the two strands. This would also agree with a model invoking XRCC4 as a stabilizing factor for DNA-PK complexes.The evidence that XRCC4 interacts with DNA-PK in vitro is 2-fold: 1) XRCC4 is phosphorylated by DNA-PK; and 2) XRCC4 facilitates Ku binding to DNA and DNA-PK assembly and alters the electrophoretic mobility of DNA-PK bou"
https://openalex.org/W1986642316,"Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by the excessive accumulation of copper in the liver. <i>WND</i> (<i>ATP7B</i>) gene, which encodes a putative copper transporting P-type ATPase, is defective in the patients. To investigate the <i>in vivo</i> function of WND protein as well as its intracellular localization, <i>WND</i>cDNA was introduced to the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat, known as a rodent model for Wilson's disease, by recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. An immunofluorescent study and a subcellular fractionation study revealed the transgene expression in liver and its localization to the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, since the synthesis of holoceruloplasmin is disturbed in the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat, the plasma level of holoceruloplasmin, oxidase-active and copper-bound form, was examined to evaluate the function of WND protein with respect to the copper transport. Consequently, the appearance of holoceruloplasmin in plasma was confirmed by Western blot analysis and plasma measurements for the oxidase activity and the copper content. These findings indicate that introduced WND protein may function in the copper transport coupled with the synthesis of ceruloplasmin and that the Golgi apparatus is the likely site for WND protein to manifest its function."
https://openalex.org/W1935159686,"Besides their role in hemostasis, platelets are involved in inflammatory and immunological processes, and we hypothesize that platelet activation may play an immunopathogenetic role in HIV-1 infection. Blood was drawn from 15 controls and 20 HIV-1-infected patients with normal platelet counts, classified into groups of non-AIDS and AIDS. Platelet activation was detected using flow cytometry with mAbs against the release markers P-selectin and CD63, mAb against GPIb, and the probe annexin V detecting surface exposure of aminophospholipids. The amount of microvesicles was measured using mAb against GPIIIa. Compared to controls, blood samples from HIV-1-infected patients showed significantly enhanced levels of microvesicles and activated platelets as detected by their exposure of P-selectin, CD63, and aminophospholipids, as well as reduction in GPIb expression. Increased expression of P-selectin and amounts of microvesicles were most pronounced in advanced clinical and immunological disease. When studying the effect of HIV-1 protease inhibitor therapy (indinavir) on platelet activation, we found that concomitant with a profound decrease in plasma viral load, there was a near normalization of several of the parameters reflecting enhanced platelet activation. Finally, we demonstrated that platelets may be an important source of the chemokine RANTES in HIV-1-infected patients. Although both unstimulated and SFLLRN-stimulated platelets from asymptomatic patients had enhanced release of RANTES, platelets from AIDS patients were characterized by markedly enhanced spontaneous, but decreased SFLLRN-stimulated release of this chemokine. Taken together, these results, which demonstrate for the first time increased platelet activation in HIV-1-infected patients with normal platelet counts, may represent a previously unrecognized immunopathogenic factor in HIV-1 infection."

https://openalex.org/W2020207491,"Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) catalyzes a Ca(2+)-dependent transglutaminase (TGase) activity that stabilizes tissues and a GTP hydrolysis activity that regulates cell receptor signaling. The purpose of this study was to examine the true substrates for nucleotide hydrolysis and the effects of these substrates on modulating the dual enzymatic activities of tTG. We found that Mg-GTP and Mg-ATP are the true substrates of the hydrolysis reaction. tTG hydrolyzed Mg-GTP and Mg-ATP at similar rates and interacted with Mg-ATP (Km = 38 +/- 10 microM) at a 3-fold greater steady-state affinity than with Mg-GTP (Km = 130 +/- 35 microM). In addition, Mg-ATP inhibited GTP hydrolysis (IC50 = 24 microM), whereas 1 mM Mg-GTP reduced ATP hydrolysis by only 20%. Furthermore, the TGase activity of tTG was inhibited by Mg-GTP, Mg-GDP, and Mg-GMP, with IC50 values of 9, 9, and 400 microM, respectively, whereas the Mg-adenine nucleotides were ineffective. Kinetic analysis of the hydrolysis reaction demonstrates the presence of separate binding sites for Mg-GTP and Mg-ATP. Finally, we found that Mg-GTP protected tTG from proteolytic degradation by trypsin, whereas Mg-ATP was ineffective. In conclusion, we report that Mg-GTP and Mg-ATP can bind to distinct sites and serve as substrates for nucleotide hydrolysis. Furthermore, binding of Mg-GTP causes a conformational change and the inhibition of TGase activity, whereas Mg-ATP is ineffective. The implication of these findings in regulating the intracellular and extracellular function of tTG is discussed."

Moreover, our results suggested that residues within the C-terminal hypervariable domains of Ras proteins may dictate, at least in part, the specificity of Ras-GRF/CDC25Mm for Ha-Ras protein.

Selective activation of a single Ras homologue by Ras-GRF/Cdc25Mm or other Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors could potentially enable each of the Ras homologues to participate in different signal transduction pathways. Ras proteins lie at the heart of signal transduction pathways, which link cell surface receptors to the nucleus. Ras proteins are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; CD, charged domain; KD, polylysine domain; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MBP, myelin basic substrate protein; GAP, GTPase-activating protein. which catalyze the exchange of free GTP for bound GDP, and they are inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which accelerate the intrinsic rate that Ras proteins hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP (1Downward J. Nature. 1992; 358: 282-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). By cycling between their active, GTP-bound state and inactive, GDP-bound state, Ras proteins function as molecular switches in signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation (2Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar, 3Bourne H.A. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Although many of the components involved in Ras-mediated signal transduction have been elucidated, many critical questions remain. For instance, human cells contain four homologous Ras proteins (Ha-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras 4A, and K-Ras 4B), but despite years of intensive study, it is still not known whether these four homologues have different biological functions or participate in distinct signal transduction cascades. Several different GEFs that activate mammalian Ras proteins have been identified. These include p140 Ras-GRF (also called Cdc25Mm) (4Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A.

It is currently unknown whether each of these GEFs activates all four Ras proteins or whether a given GEF selectively activates a single Ras protein in vivo. The question of GEF specificity is critical, however, because recent studies have shown that a given type of ligand-stimulated receptor can selectively trigger a specific GEF to activate Ras proteins. For instance, stimulated tyrosine kinase receptors or receptors associated with tyrosine kinases (such as epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin, T cell, and cytokine receptors), induce mSOS to activate Ras proteins (12McCormick F.

If, therefore, a given GEF selectively activates a single Ras homologue, this specificity could potentially enable a given extracellular ligand to selectively activate a single Ras homologue and thereby enable each of the Ras homologues to participate in distinct, parallel signal transduction pathways. Accordingly, the purpose of the studies reported herein was to determine if a given GEF could selectively activate a single Ras homologue in vivo. To distinguish exogenous from endogenous Ras proteins, a Glu-Glu (EE) epitope tag (EEEEYMPME) (25Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was added to the N termini of wild type human Ha-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras 4B cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction. cDNA clones encoding mutant Ha-Ras protein, containing Ser residues substituted for the two palmitylated Cys residues of Ha-Ras (Cys-181 and -184), and mutant K-Ras 4B protein, containing 12 neutral Glns substituted for the 6 charged amino acids of the charged domain (CD) and the 6 basic amino acids of the polylysine domain (KD) of K-Ras 4B (CD and KD are amino acids 164–169 and 175–180, respectively; see Fig. 5), were generated from wild type EE-tagged Ha-Ras and K-Ras 4B cDNA, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (26Jackson J.H.

EE-tagged wild type and mutant Ras cDNAs were cloned into the pZIP-Neo-SV(x)1 retroviral vector (27Cepko C.L. Roberts B.E. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1984; 37: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). To immunologically identify Ras-GRF, a Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) was added to the N terminus of murine p140 Ras-GRF (28Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7718-7724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by cloning Ras-GRF cDNA in frame into a modified pBabe puro retroviral vector (29Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar), containing a Kozak and Myc epitope sequence immediately 5′ of its cloning site. Ras constructs (10 μg) were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, and Ras-GRF constructs (or the empty pBabe puro vector, as control) (10 μg) were transiently transfected into the viral packaging cell line, BOSC 23 (30Pear W.S.

Ras-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were selected with G418 (400 μg/ml), selected cells were infected with BOSC cell supernatants containing recombinant Ras-GRF or control retrovirus, and infected cells were selected with puromycin B (2.5 μg/ml). Selected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys; Ras or Ras-GRF protein contained in these cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-EE (25Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H.

Cell lines expressing comparable amounts of Ras-GRF and/or each of the Ras homologues were utilized for all studies. Subconfluent (60–75%) cells expressing comparable amounts of Ha-Ras, N-Ras, or K-Ras 4B protein and comparable amounts of Ras-GRF (or the pBabe puro vector, as control) were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml) in phosphate-free, serum-free medium for 16 h and lysed. Ras proteins contained in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EE antibody, and guanine nucleotides bound to Ras proteins were eluted and fractionated by thin layer chromotography. The cpm in GTP and GDP were quantitated on an Ambis β scanner, as described previously (32Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), except the NaCl concentration in the lysis buffer was reduced to 150 mm. The percentage of total exogenous Ras protein bound to GTP was calculated according to the following formula: % GTP = cpm in GTP/(cpm in GTP + cpm in GDP), using cpm normalized for moles of phosphate. Cell lines expressing Ras-GRF and/or Ras proteins were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/60-mm dish in normal growth medium, and 16 h following plating, cells were changed to and maintained in growth medium containing 0.5% calf serum. 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 days following plating, cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer. Cell lines expressing Ras-GRF and/or Ras proteins were transiently transfected with an ERK2/pSRα plasmid construct (2 μg). 32 h following transfection, cells were serum-starved for 16 h, and ERK2 protein was subsequently immunoprecipitated from these cells with ERK2/C-14 antibody (Santa Cruz). The expression of ERK2 was evaluated by immunoblot, and the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated ERK2 was evaluated by assessing its ability to phosphorylate myelin basic substrate protein (MBP; Sigma) in vitro (33Han J. Lee J.-D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MBP was quantitated on an Ambis β scanner. To determine whether a given GEF might selectively activate a specific Ras homologue in vivo, we expressed exogenous Ras-GRF protein and/or wild type Ha-Ras, N-Ras, or K-Ras 4B protein in NIH 3T3 cells and determined the percentage of each exogenous Ras protein bound to GTP (versus GDP) in the absence or presence of Ras-GRF. As can be seen in Fig. 1, approximately 2.2-fold more (p < 0.001; t test) exogenous Ha-Ras protein was bound to GTP in cells co-expressing Ras-GRFversus cells expressing Ha-Ras alone (6.0 ± 0.05versus 2.7 ± 0.4% GTP-bound Ha-Ras, respectively). In contrast, no significant (p > 0.05) increase in the percentage of N-Ras (3.3 ± 0.3 versus 3.3 ± 0.4%) or K-Ras 4B (4.0 ± 0.3 versus 3.3 ± 0.1) protein bound to GTP was detected in cells co-expressing Ras-GRFversus cells expressing N-Ras or K-Ras 4B protein alone, respectively. To confirm that the observed 2.2-fold increase in the amount of GTP bound to Ha-Ras in the presence of Ras-GRF was biologically significant, we examined the effect of Ras-GRF on two downstream indicators of Ras activation. Specifically, we assessed the effect of exogenous Ras-GRF on MAP kinase activation and cell proliferation in serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells co-expressing Ha-Ras, N-Ras, or K-Ras 4B protein. As demonstrated in Fig.2, the kinase activity of p42 MAP kinase (ERK2) was 4-fold higher (p < 0.001; ttest) in cells co-expressing Ras-GRF and Ha-Ras versus cells expressing Ha-Ras protein alone (323,082 ± 67,209versus 79,675 ± 14,484 cpm of MBP phosphorylation, respectively). However, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in MAP kinase activity in cells co-expressing Ras-GRF and N-Ras or K-Ras 4B versus cells expressing N-Ras or K-Ras 4B protein alone (175,952 ± 49,540versus 155,972 ± 28,208 and 118,948 ± 17,911versus 134,231 ± 20,525, respectively). (As indicated in Fig. 2, the expression of ERK2 was comparable in each of the cell lines tested.) In addition, as shown in Fig.3, Ras-GRF increased the growth rate of serum-starved Ha-Ras-expressing cells approximately 2-fold but had no effect on the growth rate of N-Ras- or K-Ras 4B-expressing cells. Importantly, each of the experiments described in Figs. 1, 2, and 3utilized cells that expressed comparable amounts of Ras-GRF and/or Ha-Ras, N-Ras, or K-Ras 4B proteins (see Fig.4). Our combined results indicate, therefore, that Ras-GRF selectively activates Ha-Ras but does not activate N-Ras or K-Ras 4B, protein in vivo.Figure 2Ras-GRF increases the kinase activity of ERK2 in serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells expressing exogenous Ha-Ras, but not N-Ras or K-Ras 4B, protein. The kinase assay shows the level of ERK2-mediated MBP phosphorylation; and the immunoblot shows the relative amount of ERK2 protein expression. The cell lines described in the legend to Fig. 1 were transiently transfected with an ERK2/pSRα plasmid construct and serum-starved. 48 h following transfection, ERK2 proteins contained in these cells were immunoprecipitated with ERK2 antibody; the expression of ERK2 was evaluated by immunoblot; and the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated ERK2 was evaluated by assessing its ability to phosphorylate myelin basic substrate protein (MBP) in vitro.

We wondered, therefore, whether residues within the hypervariable domain of Ha-Ras might be required for Ras-GRF activation or whether residues within the hypervariable domain of N-Ras or K-Ras 4B might prevent Ras-GRF activation. Accordingly, as a first step in determining what factors might account for Ras-GRF specificity for Ha-Ras, we determined if Ras-GRF could activate a mutant Ha-Ras protein (2S) containing 2 nonpalmitylated Ser residues substituted for its 2 normally palmitylated Cys residues or a mutant K-Ras 4B protein (12Q) containing 12 neutral Gln residues substituted for the 12 charged amino acids of its CD and KD. We also determined if Ras-GRF could activate a nonposttranslationally modified mutant Ha-Ras protein (SAAX) containing a Ser substituted for the Cys of its CAAX motif (where C is a Cys, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is a Ser or Met) (see Fig. 5). As demonstrated in Fig.6 A, there was a significant (p < 0.001; t test) increase in the percentage of nonpalmitylated Ha-Ras protein bound to GTP in cells co-expressing Ras-GRF versus cells expressing 2S alone (4.7 ± 0.4 versus 2.4 ± 0.2%, respectively), although the magnitude of increase of Ras-GRF-induced 2S GTP binding was slightly lower than that observed with wild type Ha-Ras protein (6.6 ± 0.6 versus 2.1 ± 0.1). In addition, there was a small, but significant (p < 0.05; ttest) increase in the percentage of nonposttranslationally modified Ha-Ras protein bound to GTP in cells co-expressing Ras-GRFversus cells expressing SAAX alone (3.65 ± 0.3versus 2.48 ± 0.18%, respectively). Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 6 B, unlike its wild type counterpart, the neutralized K-Ras 4B mutant, 12Q, was efficiently (p < 0.05; t test) activated by Ras-GRF (13.7 ± 1.2versus 7.9 ± 0.7% GTP binding in the presence or absence of Ras-GRF, respectively). Indeed, the -fold increase in the amount of GTP bound to 12Q in the presence of Ras-GRF was comparable to that seen with Ras-GRF and wild type Ha-Ras. Moreover, in addition to being activated by Ras-GRF, 12Q was also constitutively active. Specifically, as indicated in Fig. 6 B, the amount of GTP bound to 12Q, in the absence of Ras-GRF or serum (7.9 ± 0.7), was more than 2-fold higher than that bound to wild type K-Ras 4B (3.3 ± 0.1) under similar conditions (p < 0.01;t test). Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig.7, the growth rate of serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells expressing 12Q alone was significantly higher than that of cells expressing wild type K-Ras 4B alone.Figure 7Serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells expressing mutant 12Q K-Ras 4B protein grow at a significantly faster rate than cells expressing wild type K-Ras 4B protein. The cell lines described in the legend to Fig. 6 B were plated, maintained, and evaluated for growth rates, according to the methods outlined in Fig. 3. Data shown represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Where no error bars are shown, the S.E. is less than 2% of they axis coordinate scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our combined results indicate that Ras-GRF selectively activates Ha-Ras, but does not activate N-Ras or K-Ras 4B, protein in vivo. As far as we know, our studies represent the first biochemical evidence that a Ras GEF can selectively activate a single Ras homologue in vivo. Our results in intact cells distinctly differ from previously reported in vitro studies, which showed that purified Ras-GRF protein can stimulate the GTP/GDP exchange of purified Ha-Ras (4Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 34Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and K-Ras 4B (34Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25542-25546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proteins. Indeed, one of these studies (34Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25542-25546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that Ras-GRF was more effective on K-Ras 4B than Ha-Ras protein. It should be noted, however, that these in vitro studies utilized the C-terminal catalytic domain of Ras-GRF rather than full-length Ras-GRF. Moreover, the catalytic domain was fused to glutathione S-transferase or oligohistidine. It is possible, therefore, that these in vitro studies failed to detect Ha-Ras specificity because residues/domains outside of the catalytic domain of Ras-GRF dictate Ha-Ras specificity, and/or fusion to glutathioneS-transferase or oligohistidine ablates Ras-GRF specificity. In addition, it is also possible that spatial determinants (such as contiguous membrane co-localization, scaffolding proteins, etc.) and/or other cellular factors mediate Ras-GRF specificity in intact cells. Our studies underscore the importance, therefore, of utilizing intact cells and full-length proteins in studies aimed at determining GEF specificity. Although numerous investigators have added EE, Myc, or other epitope tags to the N termini of Ras and Ras-GRF proteins without any known adverse effects, we cannot definitively exclude the possibility that the EE or Myc epitope tags might have affected the intrinsic biochemical properties of these proteins. Since, however, one would not expect an epitope tag-induced effect to be Ras homologue-specific, it is highly unlikely that EE or Myc epitope tags account for the disparate ability of Ras-GRF to activate Ha-Ras, but not N-Ras or K-Ras 4B, protein. Our observed approximately 2.2-fold increase in the amount of GTP bound to exogenous Ha-Ras in Ras-GRF-expressing NIH 3T3 cells is similar in magnitude to the increase previously observed in 293T cells transiently co-expressing exogenous Ha-Ras and Ras-GRF (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, the percentage of GTP bound to exogenous Ha-Ras in our control and Ras-GRF-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells (2.7 and 6%, respectively) was significantly lower than that reported in 293T cells (19 and 32%, respectively) (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To confirm, therefore, that our observed increase in Ha-Ras GTP binding was biologically significant, we determined whether this increase was associated with increases in downstream indicators of Ras activation. In direct correlation with their 2.2-fold increase in Ha-Ras GTP-binding, cells co-expressing Ras-GRF and Ha-Ras proteins demonstrated a ∼4- and ∼2-fold increase in MAP kinase activation and growth rates, respectively. Likewise, in direct correlation with their lack of increase in N-Ras or K-Ras 4B GTP binding, cells co-expressing Ras-GRF and N-Ras or K-Ras 4B proteins demonstrated no increase in MAP kinase activation or growth rates. Our results indicate, therefore, that although Ras-GRF only increased Ha-Ras GTP binding from 2.7 to 6.0% in our cells, this increase was sufficient to activate downstream Ras signaling pathways and stimulate cell proliferation. We did not observe a significant difference in the percentage of Ha-Ras protein bound to GTP when we utilized Y13–259, rather than anti-EE, antibody (data not shown). We do not believe, therefore, that our low percentage of GTP binding was due to the inability of anti-EE antibody to prevent GAP activity. Although we do not have a definitive explanation for the low percentage of GTP binding to Ras proteins in our cells, one possibility is that it is simply a consequence of the high levels of expression of exogenous Ras proteins in our cells. Thus, although the relative percentage of Ha-Ras protein bound to GTP (versus total Ha-Ras protein expressed) may be low, the absolute number of moles of Ha-Ras protein bound to GTP in our cells could nonetheless be substantial. Several regions within the Ha-Ras protein that appear to be important for binding to and/or activation by Ras-GRF have been identified in studies that utilized the catalytic domain of Ras-GRF or its yeast homologue, Cdc25. These regions include amino acids 62–78 (35Verrotti A.C. Crechet J.B. Di Blasi F. Seidita G. Mirisola M.G. Kavounis C. Nastopoulos V. Burderi E. De Vendittis E. Parmeggiani A. Fasano O.

Biochem. 1995; 228: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, amino acids 32–38 of Ras have been shown to be important for functional interaction of Ras with another yeast GEF, Sdc25 (41Mistou M.-Y. Jacquet E. Poullet P. Rensland H. Gideon P. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Parmeggiani A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 42Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9157-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since Ha-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras 4B proteins are completely identical in all three of these regions, it is unlikely that these regions account for our observed specificity of Ras-GRF for Ha-Ras. The only area where the highly homologous Ha-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras 4B proteins substantially differ from each other is in their 25 C-terminal amino acids, termed the hypervariable domain (see Fig. 5). This domain contains a CAAX motif, which signals the Ras proteins to undergo a series of posttranslational modifications. Each of the Ras proteins becomes farnesylated, truncated, and carboxylmethylated at its CAAX residues (43Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 44Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J.

Science. 1989; 245: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). However, in addition to these modifications, the Ha-Ras and N-Ras proteins also become palmitylated on 2 or 1, respectively, non-CAAX Cys residues within their hypervariable domain (43Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar,44Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). K-Ras 4B lacks these Cys residues and does not become palmitylated. Instead, K-Ras 4B contains two charged domains, consisting of 6 contiguous basic Lys (KD) and 6 contiguous charged amino acids (CD; 5 basic and 1 acidic amino acids) within its hypervariable domain. Given these C-terminal differences between Ha-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras 4B proteins, we wondered whether the 2 palmitylated Cys residues of Ha-Ras might be required for activation by Ras-GRF or the 2 charged domains of K-Ras 4B (or undefined residues within the C terminus of N-Ras) might prevent activation by Ras-GRF. Accordingly, as a first step in determining what factors might account for Ras-GRF specificity for Ha-Ras, we assessed the ability of Ras-GRF to activate a nonpalmitylated Ha-Ras mutant or a K-Ras 4B mutant whose two charged domains had been neutralized. As detailed under “Results,” the nonpalmitylated Ha-Ras mutant, 2S, was activated by Ras-GRF, although the degree of activation was slightly lower than that observed with wild type Ha-Ras protein. Thus, although Ras-GRF may activate palmitylated Ha-Ras protein more efficiently than nonpalmitylated Ha-Ras, palmitylation is clearly not absolutely required for activation by Ras-GRF, nor is it likely to contribute to Ras-GRF specificity. Surprisingly, unlike wild type K-Ras 4B, the neutralized K-Ras 4B mutant, 12Q, was efficiently activated by Ras-GRF. Our studies suggest, therefore, that the CD and KD of K-Ras 4B may prevent K-Ras 4B activation by Ras-GRF. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that the 12Q mutant, despite normal levels of posttranslational modifications, is ∼50% membrane-bound and ∼50% cytosolic. 2J. H. Jackson and S. Wong, manuscript in preparation. It could be argued, therefore, that the cytosolic location of 12Q facilitates its activation by Ras-GRF. This premise is unlikely for several reasons. First, Ras-GRF is predominantly membrane-bound (48Shou C. Wurmser A. Ling K. Barbacid M. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1887-1893PubMed Google Scholar). Second, as indicated under “Results,” a completely cytosolic, nonposttranslationally modified mutant Ha-Ras protein, SAAX (containing a Ser substituted for the Cys of its CAAX motif), is approximately 2-fold less responsive to Ras-GRF than wild type Ha-Ras protein. It is not yet clear why 12Q is constitutively more active than wild type K-Ras 4B protein. Since the NIH 3T3 cells employed in our studies do not express endogenous Ras-GRF, one possibility is that CD and KD prevent endogenous GEFs, as well as exogenous Ras-GRF, from activating K-Ras 4B. Therefore, in the absence of CD and KD, these GEFs may promiscuously activate 12Q. Alternatively, the intrinsic and/or GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of the 12Q mutant could be decreased in comparison with wild type K-Ras 4B. This possibility is less likely, however, because decreased GTPase activity would not readily explain the ability of Ras-GRF to activate 12Q. Finally, the intrinsic GTP/GDP exchange rate of the 12Q mutant could be increased in comparison with wild type K-Ras 4B. Again, however, an increased intrinsic GTP/GDP exchange rate would not necessarily affect Ras-GRF-induced GTP/GDP exchange. Additional studies, utilizing purified 12Q protein, will be required to definitively assess what, if any, role decreased GTPase activity and/or increased exchange rates may play in constitutive and/or Ras-GRF-induced activation of 12Q. In summary, our results demonstrate that Ras-GRF activates Ha-Ras, but does not activate N-Ras or K-Ras 4B, protein in vivo. Our studies represent the first biochemical evidence that a Ras GEF can selectively activate a single Ras homologue in vivo. It will be important, in future studies, to determine if other Ras GEFs or extracellular ligands selectively activate a single Ras homologuein vivo. In addition, it will be important to determine whether the four Ras homologues selectively activate distinct effectorsin vivo. These studies are currently under way and may ultimately enable us to determine whether the four Ras homologues participate in different signaling cascades and have different biological functions.

https://openalex.org/W1570625443,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine with antitumor activity against several cellular models. TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis seems to be mediated by a signaling pathway termed 'sphingomyelin-ceramide' pathway, which consists of the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and the production of its breakdown product ceramide. Our study shows that KG1a cells, which are inherently resistant to TNF-alpha and do not produce ceramide upon cytokine stimulation, can be sensitized by the use of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor PSC833. Coincubation with 1 microM of this cyclosporin derivative restored the apoptotic potential of 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha. This effect was associated with the restoration of ceramide generation (315%) and activation of neutral, but not acid sphingomyelinase activity (143%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that treatment of KG1a cells with 1 microM PSC833 led to a threefold increase in inner plasma membrane sphingomyelin content and basal neutral sphingomyelinase activity. These results support the hypothesis whereby resistance to TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis of certain leukemic cells is linked to the disposability of the sphingomyelin pool. These data also suggest a role for P-glycoprotein in sphingomyelin transverse plasma membrane asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W1600700021,"Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (GNPDA) catalyzes the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, a reaction that under physiological conditions proceeds to the formation of fructose-6-phosphate. Though first identified in mammalian tissues in 1956, the enzyme has not previously been molecularly characterized in mammalian tissues, although a bacterial GNPDA has been cloned. Recently, a protein displaying similarity to bacterial GNPDA was purified and cloned from sperm extract. It was proposed that this protein was the factor, found in sperm extracts, that causes calcium oscillations in cells; thus, the protein was named 'oscillin.' We demonstrate that oscillin is the mammalian form of glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase by showing that cloned oscillin has a robust GNPDA activity and can account for all such activity in mammalian tissues extracts. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry localize GNPDA selectively to tissues with high energy requirements such as the apical zone of transporting epithelia in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney and the small intestine; to neurons (but not glia) and especially to nerve terminals in the brain; and to motile sperm. Recombinant GNPDA and GNPDA purified to homogeneity from hamster sperm fail to elevate intracellular calcium when injected into mouse eggs over a wide range of concentrations under conditions in which sperm extracts elicit pronounced calcium oscillations. Thus, the calcium-releasing or oscillin activity of sperm extracts is due to a substance other than GNPDA. Since GNPDA is the sole enzyme linking hexosamine systems with glycolytic pathways, we propose that it provides a source of energy in the form of phosphosugar derived from the catabolism of hexosamines found in glycoproteins, glycolipids, and sialic acid-containing macromolecules. Evidence that GNPDA can regulate hexosamine stores comes from our observation that transfection of GNPDA into HEK-293 cells reduces cellular levels of sialic acid."

We and others recently identified transcription factor Hac1p/Ern4p responsible for the response in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand found that Hac1p expression is controlled by the regulated splicing of HAC1 mRNA. Walter and co-workers (Sidrauski, C., Cox, J. S., and Walter, P. (1996) Cell, 87, 405–413) further showed that the splicing requires tRNA ligase but not spliceosome. In this report, we carried out mutational analysis ofHAC1 mRNA and revealed several unique features of the splicing. First, a mutation or deletion of the branchpoint-like sequence present in HAC1 intron did not affect the splicing. Second, cleavage of the splice sites was sequence-specific and thus completely blocked by some point mutations introduced at the 5′ or 3′ splice site. Third, cleavage of the 5′ and 3′ splice sites could occur independently as judged by the nature of splicing intermediates accumulated. Fourth, swapping the nucleotide sequences of the 5′ and 3′ splice sites inhibited the ligation but not the cleavage step. We conclude that signaling from the ER activates putative endonucleases that can carry out sequence-specific cleavage of the splice sites in a random order.

We and others recently demonstrated that a basic leucine zipper protein Hac1p/Ern4p functions as the transcription factor responsible for the UPR in S. cerevisiae; haploid cells lacking Hac1p (hac1Δ) are unable to induce transcription of any of the target genes of the UPR and exhibit sensitivity to ER stress (7Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Nikawa J. Akiyoshi M. Hirata S. Fukuda T.

Furthermore, Hac1p expression was found to be regulated posttranscriptionally in a completely unexpected manner;HAC1 mRNA is constitutively expressed but becomes spliced in response to ER stress (13Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, an intron of 252 nt is removed from 1.4-kb precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) to produce 1.2-kb mature mRNA (see Fig. 1 A). The splicing event entirely depends on the signaling from the ER, and expression of mature mRNA activates the UPR. Since the 5′ splice site is located within the coding region, this splicing replaces the C-terminal portion of Hac1p. Pre- and mature mRNAs encode a protein of 230 and 238 aa, respectively, although these two types of Hac1p are supposed to share identical N-terminal 220 aa. Interestingly, only ER-stressed cells produce detectable amounts of Hac1p of 238 aa, which is thus translated from mature mRNA. Although Cox and Walter (13Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) ascribed the absence of 230-aa-Hac1p potentially synthesized from pre-mRNA to its extreme instability, we showed that there is essentially no difference in stability between 230-aa- and 238-aa-Hac1p and that the absence of 230-aa-Hac1p is due to the lack of translation of pre-mRNA. Namely, Hac1p is synthesized only after the mRNA splicing takes place, leading to activation of the UPR (14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This splicing is also quite unique in that sequences around the 5′ and 3′ splice sites do not match the consensus found in S. cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes (GT-AG or AT-AC; Refs. 15Kreivi J.-P. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 802-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and16Tarn W.-Y. Steitz J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 132-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Walter and co-workers (17Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) further showed that splicing ofHAC1 pre-mRNA is not mediated by the conventional pre-mRNA processing system. The splicing was not affected by conditional mutation of two components of the spliceosome (prp2 ts and prp8 ts), and tRNA ligase was found to be directly involved in the final step of the splicing, joining the two exons after ER stress-induced cleavage ofHAC1 pre-mRNA. In this report, we took a different approach to gain insight into the mechanism of this unconventional type of mRNA splicing. The results obtained by mutational analysis ofHAC1 mRNA will be discussed in relation to the features known for conventional pre-mRNA splicing as well as tRNA splicing. The yeast strain used in this study was KMY1145 (MATα leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 hac1Δ::TRP1 ura3–52::URA3-UPRE-CYC1-lacZ) (14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The composition of synthetic complete medium used for selection of transformants such as SC(-Ura, Leu) has been described (18Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Tunicamycin was obtained from Sigma (T-7765) and used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml throughout the experiments. Transformation of yeast cells was performed by the lithium acetate method (19Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The parental single-copy plasmids carrying the HAC1 gene, YCp-HAC1WT, and YCp-HAC1WT(XbaI), were described previously (14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Plasmids with some mutated HAC1, YCp-HAC1-mBp and YCp-HAC1-ΔSL3 (Fig. 1), were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (21Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Other mutations were introduced into YCp-HAC1WT(XbaI) by replacing the 0.18-kb XbaI640-HindIII818 or 0.11-kbHindIII818-EcoRI930 fragment with the corresponding fragment of the product obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated mutagenesis after its sequence had been confirmed. Northern blot hybridization analysis was carried out as described previously (6Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 7Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T.

The positions of probes specific for the first or second exon ofHAC1 are illustrated in Fig. 1 A. Cellular UPR activity was monitored by measuring the level of β-galactosidase expressed from the UPRE-CYC1-lacZ reporter gene that had been integrated into the chromosome of KMY1145. Induction of β-galactosidase by tunicamycin entirely depends on both the splicing of HAC1pre-mRNA induced by the signaling from the ER and the direct interaction between Hac1p thus produced and cis-acting unfolded protein-response element (UPRE) (7Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Assays for β-galactosidase activity in yeast were carried out as described previously (6Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). We utilized the mfold server by Zuker and Turner on the internet 2http://www.ibc.wustl.edu/~zuker/rna. to obtain a possible secondary structure of HAC1pre-mRNA at 30 °C. All of the nine structures obtained with minimum energy lower than −421.6 kcal/mol gave rise to an identical secondary structure for the intron-containing region which, as shown in Fig. 1 B, contained four stem-loop structures (designated SL1 to SL4 from the 5′ side). Interestingly, the 5′ or 3′ splice site was predicted to be localized in the loop of SL1 or SL4, respectively, each loop consisting of seven nucleotides (Fig. 2). A branchpoint (Bp)-like sequence (UACUAAG) present in HAC1intron (17Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) was found around the loop of SL3. The Bp sequence known to be almost invariant in S. cerevisiae (UACUAAC) is utilized to form the lariat intermediate during the first step in conventional pre-mRNA splicing and is also important for formation of splicing complex as well as commitment complex (Ref. 22Berglund J.A. Chua K. Abovich N. Reed R. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar and references therein). The Bp-like sequence in HAC1 intron is found 28 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ splice sites, which matches well with Bp sequences usually located 20–40 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ splice sites (15Kreivi J.-P. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 802-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We thus mutated the Bp-like sequence and examined its effect on splicing of HAC1 mRNA induced by tunicamycin, which is known to elicit ER stress by inhibiting N-glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins, leading to activation of the UPR (2Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 23Elbein A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1981; 6: 219-221Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the hac1Δ strain carrying the wild-type HAC1gene on a single-copy expression plasmid (referred to asYCp-HAC1WT in Fig. 1 C) as well as wild-type strain, splicing of constitutively expressed 1.4-kb HAC1pre-mRNA was induced within 1 h after addition of tunicamycin to produce 1.2-kb mature mRNA as reported previously (13Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, β-galactosidase expressed from the UPRE-CYC1-lacZ reporter gene was induced approximately 10-fold (Fig. 1 C). When the Bp-like sequence inHAC1 intron was mutated from UACUAAG to AUGAUUG without altering the GC content and the resulting mutant HAC1 gene designated mBp was introduced into the hac1Δ strain, the splicing occurred normally, and β-galactosidase was well induced. We further deleted the entire SL3 from HAC1 (designated ΔSL3); however, the deletion did not affect either the splicing ofHAC1 pre-mRNA or induction of β-galactosidase significantly. These results clearly indicated that the Bp-like sequence in HAC1 intron is not required for the regulated splicing of HAC1 pre-mRNA. Next we examined whether nucleotide sequences around the splice sites were specifically recognized by putative endonucleases during the splicing reaction. To introduce various point mutations at the 5′ or 3′ splice site, we carried out PCR-mediated mutagenesis using a mutant version ofHAC1 designated YCp-HAC1WT(XbaI) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although YCp-HAC1WT(XbaI) contained an XbaI site at nucleotide 640 that changed Leu214-Asp215 to Ser-Arg, the two amino acid changes did not affect the level of eitherHAC1 mRNA or Hac1p but only slightly reduced the transcriptional activator activity of Hac1p (14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A point mutation was introduced into each of the seven nucleotides predicted to form a loop structure of SL1 (5′ splice site) or SL4 (3′ splice site) and one flanking nucleotide each at both sides, where G was changed to C, A was changed to T, and vice versa so that the GC content was not altered (Fig. 2). For convenience, nucleotides at the 5′ side or 3′ side of the cleavage site were minus- or plus-numbered. After introduction of each point mutant into the hac1Δ strain and after 3 h of incubation in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, β-galactosidase activity expressed from the reporter gene was determined, and the extent of induction was compared with that of the wild-type (Fig. 2,A and B). Some of the point mutations were found to strongly inhibit the induction, whereas others were not. Interestingly, four out of the nine nucleotides (−3, −1, +3, and +5, boxed in Fig. 2) conserved between the 5′ and 3′ splice sites were most critical for the UPR; a point mutation of any of these nucleotides abolished induction of β-galactosidase almost completely, with one exception that affected the +5 nucleotide of the 3′ splice site. On the other hand, the nucleotide at +2 of either splice site seemed not to be important, and the effects of point mutations at −4, −2, +1, and +4 varied considerably between the 5′ and 3′ splice sites. These results indicated that sequence integrity of the splice sites is highly important for the UPR and suggested that putative endonucleases specifically recognize nucleotide sequences at both of the splice sites. Northern blot hybridization analysis was carried out to determine which step of the splicing was blocked by point mutations introduced at the 5′ or 3′ splice site (Fig.3). Total RNAs isolated from transformants cultured for 1 h in the presence or absence of tunicamycin were analyzed using a probe specific for either the first exon or the second exon of HAC1. In hac1Δ cells carrying YCp-HAC1WT(XbaI), constitutively expressed 1.4-kb pre-mRNA (lanes 1 and 13) was spliced by tunicamycin treatment to produce 1.2-kb mature mRNA (lanes 2 and 14). In this experiment, a significantly increased amount of 0.7-kb band was detected with probe specific for the first exon (lane 2) as compared with the previous experiment using YCp-HAC1WT (a band marked by an asterisk in Fig. 1 C). Because this band was not detected using probe specific for the second exon (Fig. 3, lane 14) or intron (data not shown), it must consist only of the first exon. Similarly, a band of 0.4 kb detected with probe specific for the second exon (lane 14) must consist only of the second exon, whose amount was significantly higher than that obtained with YCp-HAC1WT (data not shown). Therefore, the increased amounts of these intermediates are likely to result from slightly inefficient ligation of the two exons due to the nucleotide alteration introduced to create anXbaI site at nucleotide 640, 16 nucleotides upstream of the 5′ splice site. Alternatively, the alteration introduced might have affected RNA stability. The amounts of mature mRNA detected in tunicamycin-treated cells carrying various mutant versions of HAC1 (Fig. 3) were generally well correlated with cellular UPR activities determined by β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 2). Especially, virtually no mature mRNA was detected when a point mutation was introduced either at −1 of the 5′ splice site (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and18) or at −1 of the 3′ splice site (lanes 10 and22). Instead, certain novel bands were detected under these conditions. In tunicamycin-treated cells carrying a point mutation at −1 of the 5′ splice site, probe specific for the first exon detected a band of 1.0 kb (lane 6) that was not detected with probe for the second exon (lane 18) but was detected with probe specific for intron (data not shown). Thus, the 1.0-kb band must represent a splicing intermediate consisting of the first exon and intron. In addition, the 0.7-kb band consisting of only the first exon was missing (lane 6), but the 0.4-kb band consisting of only the second exon was still detected (lane 18). These results strongly indicated that the point mutation at −1 of the 5′ splice site completely blocked the cleavage at the 5′ splice site without affecting the cleavage at the 3′ splice site. An almost identical pattern was obtained when a point mutation was introduced at +5 of the 5′ splice site (data not shown). On the other hand, a point mutation at +1 of the 5′ splice site showed milder effects on the splicing than the −1 mutation. β-Galactosidase was slightly induced (Fig. 2 A) and a correspondingly small amount of mature mRNA was detected (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and20). In this case, two intermediates were detected simultaneously (lane 8), which were assigned to consist of the first exon and intron or only the first exon by differential hybridization to the probes used, indicating that the cleavage at the 5′ splice site was hampered but not blocked completely by the +1 mutation. Point mutations at −4, −3, and +3 of the 5′ splice site produced similar patterns (data not shown). In contrast, in tunicamycin-treated cells carrying a point mutation at −1 of the 3′ splice site, two bands migrating at around the 0.7-kb fragment were detected with probe specific for the second exon (lane 22) or with probe specific for intron (data not shown), but not with probe for the first exon (lane 10). Hybridization with a pair of probes specific to either 5′ side or 3′ side of the intron indicated that the faster migrating band lacked the 5′ side of intron (data not shown). Thus, these bands must represent splicing intermediates consisting of the second exon and intron of different lengths. Furthermore, the 0.4-kb band consisting of only the second exon was absent (lane 22), and normal level of the 0.7-kb band consisting of only the first exon was detected (lane 10). These results strongly indicated that the point mutation at −1 of the 3′ splice site completely blocked the cleavage at the 3′ splice site without affecting the cleavage at the 5′ splice site. Point mutations at −3, +3, +4 of the 3′ splice site showed almost identical patterns (data not shown). From these results, we concluded that cleavages at the 5′ or 3′ splice site can occur not only independently from each other but in a random order. Finally, we made three additional mutant versions of HAC1 by swapping the nucleotides around the 5′ splice site and those around the 3′ splice site, and examined their effects on the UPR (Fig. 4). As already shown in Fig. 2, not only seven nucleotides predicted to be localized in the respective loop structure, but also two flanking nucleotides at the position of −4 and +5 seemed to be important for the cleavage. Especially, the G to C mutation at +5 of the 5′ splice site completely blocked the cleavage at the 5′ splice site, whereas the same mutation at +5 of the 3′ splice site affected the splicing only weakly. Therefore, we swapped a total of nine nucleotides to see whether these differential effects are indicative of the involvement of two different endonucleases in cleaving two splice sites or not. M1(3′-3′) contained 3′-type nine nucleotides at the 5′ splice site with those at the 3′ splice site unchanged. M2(5′-5′) contained 5′-type nine nucleotides at the 3′ splice site with those at the 5′ splice site unchanged. In M3(3′-5′), the nine nucleotides at the splice sites were entirely swapped. When induction of β-galactosidase from the reporter gene was compared (Fig. 4, bottom), M1, M2, and M3 retained 81, 18, and 6% activity of WT(5′-3′), respectively, indicating that the replacement of the nucleotides at the 3′ splice site by those at the 5′ splice site showed more profound effects on the splicing. Correspondingly decreased amounts of mature mRNA were detected by Northern blot hybridization in tunicamycin-treated cells carrying each of the mutant versions as compared with those carrying the wild-typeHAC1 (Fig. 4). Sequencing of reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR products showed that each mature mRNA produced contained an exact exon-exon junction predicted from the altered sequences of the splice sites (data not shown). Contrary to the results shown in Fig. 3, however, the splicing intermediate consisting of the first exon and intron (1.0 kb) or the second exon and intron (0.7 kb) was not detected with probe specific for the first or the second exon, respectively, in tunicamycin-treated cells carrying M2 (lanes 6 and14) or M3 (lanes 8 and 16) although the extent of induction was less than 20% of WT in these cells. Instead, evidently increased amounts of the splicing intermediate consisting of only the first exon (0.7 kb, lanes 6 and8) or only the second exon (0.4 kb, lanes 14 and16) were detected. It seemed very likely that swapping the nine nucleotides inhibited the ligation but not the cleavage step, raising the possibility that the cleavage at the 5′ and 3′ splice sites is achieved by the same endonuclease. In addition to autocatalytic self-splicing of group I and group II introns, two types of protein-mediated RNA splicing, namely spliceosome-dependent pre-mRNA splicing and tRNA splicing, have gained much attention and which have revealed completely different mechanisms. In conventional pre-mRNA splicing, sequences at the 5′ and 3′ splice sites are strictly conserved (GT-AG or AT-AC) and sequence-specific cleavage at the splice sites is achieved by involvement of various small nuclear RNAs and numerous proteins complexed in a spliceosome. In addition, cleavage occurs in two sequential steps. First, cleavage of the 5′ splice site occurs in concert with the formation of 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond between the 5′-end of the intron and the adenosine in the Bp sequence located upstream of the 3′ splice site, thus producing a lariat structure. Second, cleavage of the 3′ splice site occurs, leading to release of the lariat intron and simultaneous ligation of the two exons (15Kreivi J.-P. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 802-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Tarn W.-Y. Steitz J.A. Trends Biochem.

On the other hand, tRNA splicing is catalyzed by the sequential action of three protein enzymes: a site-specific endonuclease, a tRNA ligase, and a phosphotransferase. In contrast to conventional pre-mRNA splicing, nucleotide sequences at the splice sites in tRNAs are not conserved, and the precise cleavage at the two splice sites is explained by a “ruler mechanism” in which a fixed distance to the splice sites is measured from a certain position in the mature domains of the tRNAs. Furthermore, the two splice sites are cleaved independently (25Belfort M. Weiner A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1003-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Trotta C.R. Miao F.

Recent work conducted in two laboratories established that the regulated splicing of mRNA encoding transcription factor Hac1p/Ern4p is required for the UPR (13Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Walter and co-workers (17Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the splicing of HAC1 pre-mRNA is not mediated by spliceosome-dependent pre-mRNA processing as mentioned earlier. The results reported in this paper further substantiate this notion by demonstrating that the Bp-like sequence present in HAC1 intron is not required for the splicing (Fig. 1) and that cleavage of the two splice sites appeared to occur in a random order (Fig. 3). Direct involvement of tRNA ligase in the splicing of HAC1pre-mRNA (17Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) has evoked the possibility that cleavage ofHAC1 pre-mRNA is also catalyzed by tRNA endonuclease. This hypothesis can now be pursued as a result of recent success in cloning genes that encode subunits of tRNA endonuclease (26Trotta C.R. Miao F. Arn E.A. Stevens S.W. Ho C.K. Rauhut R. Abelson J.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, our results revealed some important differences in the mode of recognition of the splice sites between the tRNA endonuclease and putative endonucleases responsible for the UPR. In contrast to tRNA splicing, sequence integrity at the splice sites of HAC1pre-mRNA appeared to be very important for cleavage (Fig. 2). In addition, we previously showed that insertion of two nucleotides into a position between −2 and −1 of the 5′ splice site completely blocked the splicing (14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), whereas a similar insertion should result in a predictable shift of the cleavage site in the case of tRNA splicing (27Reyes V.M. Abelson J. Cell. 1988; 55: 719-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER is considered to be sensed by Ire1p/Ern1p, a transmembrane protein kinase localized in the ER, and the signal is transmitted across the lipid bilayer through oligomerization and autophosphorylation of Ire1p (5Cox J.S.

While this paper was in review, Sidrauski and Walter (29Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) reported that the purified C-terminal portion of Ire1p containing the kinase domain and the tail domain similar in sequence to mammalian RNase L has endonuclease activity that successfully cleaves HAC1pre-mRNA in vitro. The effects on the splicing of a point mutation they introduced at −1 of the 5′ or 3′ splice site are consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3. In addition, our results of the swapping experiment (Fig. 4) may support the involvement of the Ire1p homodimer in the cleavage of the two splice sites. However, their primer extension analysis in vitro shifted the actual cleavage sites toward the 5′ side by one nucleotide from those we determined by mutational analysis in vivo (14Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1845-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) for both 5′ and 3′ splice sites; namely, they claim that the cleavage occurs between −2 and −1 (see Fig. 2). The reason for this apparent discrepancy remains to be clarified. In conclusion, our results reported here unraveled a novel mechanism for protein-mediated RNA splicing: sequence-specific and non-sequential cleavage of the splice sites.

In this study, we examined the effect of MKP-1 on signaling components upstream of ERK1 and ERK2. Coexpression of MKK1 or MKK2 with MKP-1 resulted in 7–10-fold activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK), which required the presence of regulatory serine phosphorylation sites. Endogenous MKK1 and MKK2 were also activated upon MKP-1 expression. Raf-1, a direct regulator of MKK1 and MKK2, was activated under these conditions, and a synergistic activation of MKK was observed upon coexpression of Raf-1 and MKP-1. This effect did not appear to involve synthesis of autocrine growth factors or the inhibition of basal extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity but was inhibited by a dominant negative Ras mutant, indicating that MKP-1 enhances Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1 in a cell autonomous manner. This study demonstrates positive feedback regulation of Raf-1 and MKK by the MKP-1 immediate early gene and a potential mechanism for activating Raf-1/MKK signaling pathways alternative to those involving ERK.

MKKs 1 and 2, in turn, can be activated through phosphorylation by members of the Raf protein kinase family, including Raf-1, which is ubiquitously expressed (8Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.

The product of the immediate early gene, MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP-1), is able to dephosphorylate phosphoserine/threonine as well as phosphotyrosine residues, and shows selectivity for ERKs 1 and 2in vitro, with lower activity toward other MAP kinases such as JNK and p38 MAP kinase (14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2365-2374PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). MKP-1 inactivates ERK following growth factor stimulation in intact cells and also suppresses signaling downstream of ERK at the level of gene transcription and proliferation (15Sun H. Charles C.H.

Interestingly, MKP-1 is transcriptionally induced by stress-regulated pathways such as those occurring in response to UV treatment or activation of stress-regulated protein kinases (18Bokemeyer D.

A similar cross-regulation is observed between osmotic stress- and pheromone-activated protein kinase cascades in yeast involving transcriptional induction of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (20Millar J.B.A. Buck V.

To obtain a more complete understanding of how MKP-1 regulates cell signaling, we examined the effects of this enzyme on other components in the MAP kinase pathway in NIH 3T3 cells. Our studies demonstrate the novel finding that MKP-1 positively regulates Raf-1 and MKK components upstream of ERK in an ERK-independent manner, providing a means by which different pathways downstream of Raf-1 might be differentially controlled. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well into six-well plates (35 mm diameter) and transfected at 50–80% confluence using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions and 1 μg of cDNA unless otherwise noted. Transfection efficiency was estimated as 20–30%, based on fluorescence of cells transfected in parallel with a construct (pK7-GFP) expressing green fluorescent protein (a gift of Dr. Ian Macara). The cDNA constructs for expression of wild type and mutant hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MKKs 1 and 2 in pMCL have been described previously (24Mansour S. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M.

Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dominant negative H-Ras (S17N) construct was a gift of Dr. Melanie Cobb. Cells were harvested 40–48 h following transfection by washing twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and extraction in 350 μl of tissue lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine) followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min to clarify lysates. Antibodies (0.3 μg) recognizing ERK2 (C-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MKK1 (17020, Transduction Laboratories), MKK2 (N-20, Santa Cruz), hemagglutinin tag (12CA5, BabCo), or Raf-1 (C-12, Santa Cruz) were added to separate aliquots of lysates, which were allowed to incubate on ice for 1 h. Immune complexes were then incubated end-over-end at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h. The immune complexes were washed twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate) and incubated with 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 30 μm cold ATP, and substrate for 10 min at 30 °C. Substrates used were 5 μg of myelin basic protein for measurement of ERK activity, 1 μg of catalytically inactive ERK2 (K52R) for MKK activity, or 1 μg of catalytically inactive MKK1 (K97 m) for Raf-1 activity. Reactions were quenched with Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. 32P incorporation was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. To confirm MKP-1 expression, cells were transfected with MKP-1 cDNA and incubated for 40 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were removed to methionine-free DMEM containing 4% FBS for 1 h, then incubated with the same medium containing 75 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 4 h. Extracts were prepared, and MKP-1 was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody 9E10 and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. AP-1 promoter-dependent transcription was assayed by transfecting cells with a TRE-CAT reporter construct (pTE3ΔS-N) (a gift of Drs. Ami Aronhein and Michael Karin) and v-Raf-3611-MSV (a gift of Dr. Peter Shaw), constitutively active “MKK1-G1C” (ΔN4/S218E/S222D) (26Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuda J. Manning M. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), or constitutively active “MKK2-KW+71” (ΔN4/S222D/S226D) (25Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Gloor K.K. Ahn N.G. Cell Growth Diff. 1996; 7: 243-250PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of MKP-1 cDNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was measured in 20 μg of protein extract by incorporation of tritium from [3H]acetyl coenzyme A into chloramphenicol in 30 min. ERK, MKK, Raf-1, or Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SOS) were detected by resolving proteins using SDS-PAGE followed by semidry transfer (Ellard Instruments) onto Immobilon P (Millipore). Blots were blocked for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.15m NaCl), Tween 20 (0.1%), nonfat dry milk (5%), followed by incubation with antibodies (listed above, IM2 for the Flag epitope on Raf-1 (Kodak), C-23 for SOS (Santa Cruz)) in TBS/Tween 20 (1:1000 dilution in all cases). The blots were washed four times with TBS/Tween 20, then incubated with horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase secondary antibodies (1:5000). Protein detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies or nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate with alkaline phosphatase secondary antibodies. In some cases, anti-HA and anti-ERK primary antibodies were incubated together to detect HA-MKK and ERK proteins simultaneously. Cells were transiently transfected with wild type MKK1 or MKK2 and MKP-1, and the activity of expressed MKK was measured. As shown in Fig.1 A, coexpression with wild type MKP-1 resulted in 7–10-fold enhancement of the activity of expressed MKK1 or MKK2. Controls from one experiment showed comparable MKK protein levels present in immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B), demonstrating enhanced specific activity of wild type MKK. This effect was not observed with MKP-1 (C258S), indicating that the effect requires MKP-1 activity. Under conditions where MKK was activated by MKP-1, endogenous ERK2 activity was low (Fig. 1, C andD), as was coexpressed wild type ERK2 (data not shown). In parallel experiments, endogenous MKK1 and MKK2 activities were enhanced 2-fold upon expression of MKP-1, demonstrating that these effects were not limited to overexpressed MKK (data not shown). This activation is submaximal, since the transfection efficiency of these cells was approximately 20–30%. In comparison, PDGF (25 ng/ml) treatment of cells resulted in 8–10-fold activation of endogenous MKK1 (data not shown). The activation of expressed MKK by MKP-1 was also observed in cells that were serum-depleted for 18 h prior to cell lysis (Fig. 2 A). Under serum-starved conditions, ERK activation was not detected in the absence of growth factor stimulation (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the effect of MKP-1 on MKK was not due to removal of ERK activity. In three separate serum starvation experiments, the average MKK1 activation by MKP-1 was approximately 10-fold (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, these effects of MKP-1 were observed with expressed as well as endogenous MKK under serum-starved and serum-fed conditions. Expression of MKP-1 was confirmed by metabolically labeling cells with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitating the Myc-tagged MKP-1. A 40-kDa protein corresponding to the reported size of MKP-1 or the MKP1 (C258S) mutant was present in transfected cells (Fig.3 A). As expected, MKP-1 suppressed ERK activation in response to constitutively active MKK2-KW+71, evident by the disappearance of the gel-retarded form of ERK2 (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, MKP-1 suppressed ERK2 activation by constitutively active MKK1-G1C, PDGF, or serum (data not shown). Inhibition of signaling downstream of ERK was tested by coexpressing an AP1 promoter-driven CAT reporter construct with constitutively active MKK1, MKK2, or v-Raf in the presence versus absence of MKP-1. As shown in Fig. 3 C, transcription from the AP-1 promoter was inhibited in the presence of MKP-1. MKK1 is activated by phosphorylation at Ser-218 and Ser-222 (29Zheng C. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 30Resing K.A. Mansour S.J. Hermann A.J. Johnson R.S. Candia J.M. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The dependence of MKK1 activation by MKP-1 on these phosphorylation sites was examined by coexpressing MKP-1 with a series of MKK1 mutants with varying specific activities. MKK1(S218E/S222D), which substitutes regulatory phosphorylation sites with acidic amino acids, MKK1(ΔN4), which deletes amino acid residues 44–51 but leaves Ser-218 and Ser-222 intact, and MKK1(ΔN4/S218A/S222A), which substitutes regulatory phosphorylation sites with Ala in the ΔN4 background, are constitutively active mutants with 65-fold, 80-fold, and 40-fold greater activity than basal wild type MKK1, respectively (26Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuda J. Manning M. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). MKK1(S218A/S222A) has activity comparable to basal wild type MKK1 (24Mansour S. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. VandeWoude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). MKP-1 expression resulted in activation of wild type MKK1 as well as MKK1(ΔN4) (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, MKP-1 had no effect on any of the MKK1 mutants containing Ser-218 or Ser-222 substitutions. Controls demonstrated comparable protein levels of each MKK1 in the immune complex assays (Fig.4 B). These data suggest that an upstream activator that targets Ser-218 and Ser-222 is required for MKP-1-dependent activation of MKK. Raf-1 has been shown to be a major upstream activator of MKK1 and MKK2 (8Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 9Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A.J. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1992; 257: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The dependence of Raf-1 activity on MKP-1 was explored by transfecting cells with HA-tagged MKK1 and varying amounts of Raf-1 cDNA in the presence or absence of MKP-1. A small amount of Raf-1 expression significantly enhanced the MKK activation by MKP-1 (Fig. 5 A). Increasing the amount of overexpressed Raf-1 did not further augment MKK1 activation by MKP-1 (Fig. 5 A). Western blots probing the Flag epitope showed increased expressed Raf-1 levels in transfected cells, but no variation due to MKP-1 (data not shown). Endogenous MKK activity was also elevated with increasing Raf-1 levels in the presence of MKP-1 compared with MKK activity observed in the absence of MKP-1 (data not shown). Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from the same cell extracts showed corresponding activation by MKP-1 (Fig. 5 B). In the absence of expressed Raf-1, MKP-1 caused a 7-fold activation of endogenous Raf-1. Expression of Raf-1 resulted in up to 50-fold greater Raf activity in immunoprecipitates, which was further augmented by 3–5-fold by coexpression of MKP-1. When the same cells were treated with PDGF, Raf-1 activity was elevated by 10–20-fold, comparable to the activities seen in the presence of MKP-1. Thus, MKP-1 activates Raf-1 in unstimulated cells to levels comparable to PDGF-treated conditions. Raf-1 protein from PDGF-treated cells showed a characteristic gel mobility retardation due to phosphorylation, whereas Raf-1 from MKP-1-expressing cells showed a migration similar to Raf-1 from unstimulated cells (data not shown). This suggests that Raf-1 regulation by MKP-1 may occur by a mechanism distinct from PDGF-induced Raf-1 stimulation. Furthermore, MKP-1 failed to activate the mutant, Raf-1 (S621A) (data not shown). Although expression of Raf-1 (S621A) did not inhibit the activation of expressed MKK by MKP-1, mutant Raf-1 led to no further enhancement of MKK-1 activation by MKP-1 (data not shown). Taken together, these data provide evidence that the activation of MKK by MKP-1 occurs through elevation of Raf-1 catalytic activity. Involvement of Ras was further investigated using a dominant negative H-Ras mutant (S17N), which inhibits growth factor-dependent activation of ERK. Coexpression of Ras (S17N) with MKP-1 and wild type MKK1 showed partial inhibition of MKK activation by MKP-1 (Fig. 6 A) under conditions of comparable loading of MKK immunoprecipitates. Parallel controls confirmed the dominant interfering effect of Ras (S17N) on Ras signaling by showing a complete inhibition of PDGF-stimulated ERK activity (Fig. 6 B). The data strongly suggest that Raf-1 activation by MKP-1 occurs through a Ras-dependent mechanism. A key mechanism for Raf-1 activation involves interaction of Raf-1 with Ras·GTP following GDP/GTP exchange catalyzed by the SOS exchange factor (10Avruch J. Zhang Z.F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biol.

Phosphorylation of SOS by ERK- and MKK-dependent pathways reportedly prevents Ras/Raf-1 association and Raf-1 activation under conditions correlating with a reduced mobility of SOS on SDS-PAGE (33Cherniak A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We examined SOS phosphorylation under conditions where MKK was activated by MKP-1 and endogenous ERK phosphorylation was inhibited by MKP-1. Under basal conditions, no gel mobility shift of SOS was observed (data not shown). Growth factor treatment of cells results in retardation of SOS gel mobility previously attributed to Ser/Thr phosphorylation and correlated with SOS inactivation (33Cherniak A. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Waters S. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, no discernible difference in the gel retardation was observed in cells transfected with MKP-1, suggesting that SOS phosphorylation response to PDGF is not altered by MKP-1 (data not shown). To test whether the activation of Raf-1 and MKK by MKP-1 occurred through MKP-1 induction of secreted growth factors, conditioned medium was removed from cells transfected with MKP-1 and added onto cells transfected only with HA-MKK1. Under these conditions, no activation of expressed MKK1 was observed (data not shown). Furthermore, cells were transfected with MKK1 in the presence or absence of MKP-1 and treated 24 h later with the translation inhibitors, cycloheximide and puromycin. After 48 h, no inhibition of MKK activation by MKP-1 was observed (data not shown). These data indicate that the activation of MKK by MKP-1 occurs through a cell autonomous mechanism. The growth factor-stimulated MAP kinase cascade has been shown to be inactivated at the level of ERK1 and ERK2 by the dual specificity phosphatase, MKP1 (14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S.

Previous studies proposed that MKP-1 might function as a feedback regulator of ERK signaling. Originally, MKP-1 was identified through its transcriptional induction following growth factor stimulation of cells and was described as an immediate early gene whose message is rapidly induced in a manner independent of protein synthesis (39Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The kinetics of MKP-1 induction are thus consistent with its potential role in catalyzing ERK dephosphorylation, which occurs during a phase of inactivation observed in response to many types of stimuli. However, the induction of MKP-1 and dephosphorylation of ERK are uncorrelated in some studies, suggesting that this may not occur in all cells. For example, the inactivation of ERK in PC12 cells that occurs several minutes following epidermal growth factor-dependent activation is unaffected by cycloheximide, conditions that suppress MKP-1 induction (40Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 41Wu J. Lau L.F. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that alternative functions of MKP-1 exist that have yet to be described. In this study, we show for the first time that MKP-1 positively regulates enzymes upstream of ERK, namely MKK1, MKK2, and Raf-1, thus providing an additional pathway for feedback regulation of Raf-1 by immediate early gene expression. This effect appears to occur through a cell autonomous mechanism and is partially blocked by dominant negative Ras, indicating that Ras-mediated activation of Raf-1 is most likely involved. Several mechanisms for negative feedback regulation of upstream signaling targets by ERK, including cell surface receptors (epidermal growth factor receptor), Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SOS), or Raf-1 have been proposed (33Cherniak A. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Waters S. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Waters S. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5674-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, others have reported Raf-1 activation in unstimulated cells treated with the MKK1 inhibitor, PD98059 (60Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). It is possible that part of the stimulatory effect we observe with MKP-1 can be accounted for by relief of signal repression by ERK. However, it is unlikely that ERK inhibition accounts for all of the effects because our data were taken in cells treated under basal conditions and reproduced under serum-starved conditions where ERK activity is low or undetectable. Consistent with this, under basal or serum-starved conditions, we found no evidence for retardation in SOS gel mobility, which has been attributed to feedback phosphorylation by ERK- or MKK-dependent kinases (33Cherniak A. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Waters S. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

In addition, PDGF-induced SOS phosphorylation and gel mobility retardation were unaffected by MKP-1 expression, suggesting that altered SOS activity due to phosphorylation is not involved. The available data suggest the possibility that MKP-1 activates Raf-1 through Ras, involving a mechanism that may not involve inactivation of ERK. The incomplete effect of Ras (S17N) on MKP-1 activation of MKK suggests that Ras-independent mechanisms for Raf-1 activation might also be regulated by MKP-1. Ras-independent means of Raf-1 activation might occur through Raf dimerization or through direct phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C, ceramide-activated protein kinase, or kinase suppressor of ras, KSR (11Marais R.

Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Raf-1 may be regulated by interactions with other signaling components such as 14-3-3 proteins (57Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R. Science. 1994; 265: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 58Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. McNichol M.A. Gross R.W. Williams L.T.

It is conceivable that alternative mechanisms for Raf-1 activation may be regulated indirectly through dephosphorylation of cellular targets by MKP-1. A significant implication of our study is that MKP-1 may alter the flux through different Raf-1-dependent pathways, thus providing a means of uncoupling different regulatory pathways downstream of Ras. For example, Raf-1 has been shown to phosphorylate other proteins, including IkB and the proapoptotic Bad protein (61Wang H.-G. Rapp U.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 62Li S. Sedivy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), suggesting that it targets other substrates and downstream pathways in addition to MKK1 and MKK2 and the ERK pathway. Under some conditions, signaling through Raf-1 may also activate p70 S6 kinase through an ERK-independent mechanism (64Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our results would predict that induction of MKP-1 (e.g. through immediate early gene expression or activation of stress-activated protein kinase pathways) might enhance signaling through alternative Raf-1 targets under conditions where ERK signaling is suppressed. Another possibility that has yet to be demonstrated is that MKK targets other cellular substrates in addition to ERK, in which case phosphorylation of these substrates might also be enhanced by MKP-1. In summary, this study reveals the ability of MKP-1 to serve as a positive regulator of Raf-1 signaling and presents an important consideration for studies utilizing MKP-1 as an inhibitor of ERK signaling. The results suggest a novel approach to address Raf-1 regulation by both Ras-independent and dependent mechanisms, and provide the groundwork for future studies examining the control of multiple signaling pathways downstream of Raf-1.

Localization of GCN2 protein kinase to ribosomes appears to be a critical step leading to phosphorylation of eIF-2 in response to cellular stress.Phosphorylation of eIF-2 is a well characterized mechanism regulating eukaryotic protein synthesis. The eIF-2 is a three-subunit protein that couples with Met-tRNA i Met and participates in ribosomal selection of the start codon (5Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-70Google Scholar). During this initiation process, GTP bound to eIF-2 is hydrolyzed to GDP. Phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF-2 at serine 51 impedes recycling of eIF-2-GDP to the active form, eIF-2-GTP. Currently, three protein kinases that phosphorylate this regulated site of eIF-2 have been characterized and their cDNAs cloned (1Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N.

GCN2 co-migrated with free 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits, 80 S particles, and polysomes separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. When ribosomes were dissociated into 40 S and 60 S subunits by omitting MgCl2 from the extract preparation, GCN2 remained associated with 60 S ribosomal subunits (17Ramirez M. Wek R.C.

GCN2 was also complexed with ribosomal subunits after electrophoresis in a composite agarose-acrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions.

Two regions in the amino terminus of PKR, designated dsRNA-binding domains (DRBDs), contain several basic amino acids in a predicted α-helical structure that are related to a family of RNA-binding proteins (22St Johnston D.

In addition to regulating kinase activity by dsRNA, the DRBD sequences facilitate PKR association with ribosomes (20Zhu S. Romano P.R. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14434-14441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PKR targeting to ribosomes is proposed to enhance in vivo phosphorylation of eIF-2 by providing the kinase access to this substrate.In this report, we describe the finding that GCN2 residues 1467–1590 can bind independently to ribosomes. This GCN2 domain contains a lysine-rich sequence with features similar to the core of the DRBDs. Alteration of these conserved lysine residues blocked both GCN2 interaction with ribosomes and stimulation of GCN4expression in response to starvation for amino acids. As previously observed for the DRBDs, the lysine residues are essential for binding to dsRNA in vitro, suggesting that interaction with rRNA mediates ribosome targeting. This cellular localization may provide GCN2 access to its eIF-2 substrate or to regulatory ligands. Furthermore, these findings indicate that related RNA-binding sequences facilitates the in vivo activities of both GCN2 and PKR in response to cellular stresses.DISCUSSIONGCN2 is a multidomain protein kinase that regulatesGCN4 translation initiation in response to amino acid starvation. In this report, we observed that the carboxyl terminus of GCN2 from residues 1467 to 1590 directly facilitate targeting of the kinase to the translation machinery. Interestingly, comparison of this region of GCN2 with DRBD sequences that facilitate ribosome interaction of a related eIF-2 kinase, PKR, revealed a lysine-rich sequence in GCN2 with features similar to the core of this RNA-binding domain. Substitutions of lysine residues conserved among DRBDs block association of GCN2 with ribosomes and impaired the ability of the kinase to stimulate the general control pathway in response to amino acid limitation. These results suggest that appropriate localization of GCN2 to the translational machinery is an obligate step in the mechanism leading to kinase phosphorylation of eIF-2.Role of Ribosome Binding in Stimulating GCN2 Phosphorylation of eIF-2α in Response to Amino Acid Starvation ConditionsThree mutant alleles of GCN2 were examined for their effects on association of the kinase to ribosomes. While the gcn2-605 protein, containing substitutions in the DRBD-related sequence, was not associated with ribosomes, the kinase-defective gcn2-K559R protein showed a pattern of ribosome interaction similar to wild-type GCN2 (Fig. 4). GCN2 interaction with uncharged tRNA also does not appear to be a prerequisite step leading to ribosome association, since the gcn2-m2 mutant protein, containing substitutions in the HisRS-related domain that greatly reduce binding of uncharged tRNA in vitro (12Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), co-fractionates with ribosomes in the sucrose gradient (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the DRBD-related sequence of GCN2 interacts with ribosomes independent of autophosphorylation of GCN2 or stimulation of kinase activity by uncharged tRNA that accumulates during amino acid starvation conditions.What role does association with ribosomes play in the process leading to GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF-2α? Targeting to ribosomes could provide GCN2 access to its substrate eIF-2. During initiation of translation, eIF-2 is associated with ribosomal subunits, providing ribosome-associated GCN2 proximity to its substrate (5Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-70Google Scholar, 17Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A second possible role of ribosome association in the regulation of GCN2 kinase is that it provides a vehicle for GCN2 to monitor the levels of uncharged tRNA in the cell. GCN2 interaction with ribosomes may be adjacent to the aminoacyl (A) site, with the HisRS-related domain monitoring uncharged tRNA that enters and is released from this site during the elongation of step in protein synthesis. The proximity of GCN2 in the ribosome would be similar to that of the RelA protein ofE. coli. In this example, the ppGpp synthetase activity of RelA is thought to be stimulated by uncharged tRNA that binds the A site during amino acid starvation conditions (36Cashel M. Rudd K.E. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Magasanik B. Low K.B. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 1410-1438Google Scholar). This model implies that the uncharged tRNA levels in the cell can be more efficiently monitored by GCN2 when the kinase is associated with ribosomes compared with the kinase being dispersed throughout the cytoplasmic solution.In support of the idea that a ribosomal context facilitates monitoring of uncharged tRNA levels, Deutscher and colleagues (37Negrutskii B.S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3601-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) proposed that there is cellular channeling process for delivery and release of tRNA to the translation apparatus. During this channeling, tRNAs are directly transferred from aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to the elongation factors to the ribosomes without being freely soluble in the cytoplasmic fluid. After deacylation during the translation process, tRNAs reassociate with their cognate aminoacyl tRNA synthetases to repeat the cycle. Perhaps, during conditions of amino acid limitation, uncharged tRNAs whose levels are elevated, enter and are released from the A site with increased frequency by this channeling process. The ribosome localization of GCN2 would provide the kinase access to one of the channeling steps, allowing the synthetase-related domain of GCN2 to monitor the levels of uncharged tRNAs. Ancillary factors such as GCN1 and GCN20 (40Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 41Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3184-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), that form a heterocomplex associated with ribosomes and are required for high levels of GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF-2 during histidine limitation, may function to direct uncharged tRNAs from the A site to the HisRS-related domain of GCN2 (42Marton M.J. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).General Role of DRBD Sequences in Targeting Proteins to RibosomesOver 20 different proteins have been identified that contain DRBD sequences (24Kharrat A. Macias M.J. Gibson T.J. Nilges M. Pastore A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3572-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins have been characterized only by genomic sequencing projects and the role of DRBDs in facilitating their physiological functions are currently unclear. We have shown that DRBD-related sequences mediate association of the eIF-2 kinases, GCN2 and PKR, with ribosomes. Recently, another DRBD-containing protein, X1rbpa, that is the Xenopus homolog of TAR-RNA-binding protein, was also found to associate with ribosomes (43Eckmann C.R. Jantsch M.F. J. Cell. Biol. 1997; 138: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another likely example is the protein encoded by theYML3 gene from S. cerevisiae (44Graack H.R. Grohmann L. Choli T. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 45Graack H.R. Grohmann L. Kitakawa M. Schafer K.L. Kruft V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that contains a single DRBD and is associated with the large ribosomal subunit in mitochondria. The specific ribosomal locations that can accommodate by different DRBD sequences appear to be variable, with ribosomal dissociation experiments indicating that GCN2 and PKR are localized to 60 S and 40 S ribosomal subunits, respectively. These different ribosomal binding sites suggest that DRBD sequences bind to unique double-stranded regions in rRNA. Amino acid residue differences between the DRBDs would be expected to mediate this specificity for different RNA sequences and structures. Additionally, the fact that many proteins contain multiple DRBD sequences suggests that multiple RNA-binding elements may contribute to the affinity for unique ribosomal sites. Targeting of proteins to different compartments in the cell is an important mechanism regulating protein function. Proteins can associate with organelles, membranes, or components in the soluble fraction of the cell, providing proteins access to substrates or regulatory ligands. GCN2 is a member of a family of protein kinases that regulate translation by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF-2, eukaryotic initiation factor-2; ds, double-stranded; DRBD, double-stranded RNA-binding domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: eIF-2, eukaryotic initiation factor-2; ds, double-stranded; DRBD, double-stranded RNA-binding domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Localization of GCN2 protein kinase to ribosomes appears to be a critical step leading to phosphorylation of eIF-2 in response to cellular stress. Phosphorylation of eIF-2 is a well characterized mechanism regulating eukaryotic protein synthesis. The eIF-2 is a three-subunit protein that couples with Met-tRNA i Met and participates in ribosomal selection of the start codon (5Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-70Google Scholar). During this initiation process, GTP bound to eIF-2 is hydrolyzed to GDP. Phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF-2 at serine 51 impedes recycling of eIF-2-GDP to the active form, eIF-2-GTP. Currently, three protein kinases that phosphorylate this regulated site of eIF-2 have been characterized and their cDNAs cloned (1Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N.

Two of the proteins regulate protein synthesis in mammalian cells. The RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, participates in the antiviral defense mechanism mediated by interferon (6Proud C.G.

The third eIF-2 kinase, GCN2, functions in the general amino acid control pathway of yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. In response to starvation for any one of several different amino acids, GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF-2 stimulates the translation of GCN4 (2Wek R.C. Trends Biochem.

The GCN4 protein is a transcriptional activator of more than 30 genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis. This report centers on the regulation of the GCN2 protein kinase. The kinase catalytic domain of GCN2 shares sequence and structural similarities with the PKR and HRI that are distinguishable from other eukaryotic protein kinases (2Wek R.C. Trends Biochem.

It is proposed that different uncharged tRNAs, which accumulate during amino acid starvation conditions, can interact with the synthetase-related domain of GCN2, resulting in activation of the kinase and phosphorylation of eIF-2 (2Wek R.C.

Ramirez et al. (17Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) showed by several criteria that GCN2 was associated with ribosomes. GCN2 co-migrated with free 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits, 80 S particles, and polysomes separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. When ribosomes were dissociated into 40 S and 60 S subunits by omitting MgCl2 from the extract preparation, GCN2 remained associated with 60 S ribosomal subunits (17Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). GCN2 was also complexed with ribosomal subunits after electrophoresis in a composite agarose-acrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions. The related eIF-2 kinase, PKR, was also found to interact with the ribosomal machinery based on biochemical fractionation (3Samuel C.E. J. Biol.

At higher temperatures, unpaired DBs executed one-dimensional walks along the dimer rows, and recombination was observed with the same partner after walks lasting many minutes. The frequency and extent of these excursions increased with temperature. Above 660 kelvin, complete dissociation was observed and was sometimes followed by recombination by means of partner exchange.

However, IRP-2 is less abundant than IRP-1 in most tissues (32Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27327-27334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Guo B.

No associated aconitase activity could be found, and it remains uncertain whether IRP-2 incorporates an iron-sulfur cluster (33Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

A unique 73 amino acid-region, absent in IRP-1, is thought to target IRP-2 for protein degradation by the proteasome complex (37Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

In the present study, we analyzed whether IRP-2 can also function as atrans-acting repressor of translation in cells. In vitro mutagenesis has revealed alternative IRE stem-loop sequences with specificity for either IRP-1 (39Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Bonnard C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol.

Here, we inserted several specific IRE variants into the 5′-UTR of a human growth hormone (hGH) expression vector and analyzed the translational repression in stably transfected L cells. Translational inhibition through both IRP-1- and IRP-2-specific IREs was observed, thus providing evidence for a regulatory role of IRP-2 in cells. Mouse thymidine kinase-deficient L cells (Ltk−) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum. Stably transfected Ltk+ cells were selected in α-minimal essential medium containing 100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μmaminopterin, and 16 μm thymidine (42Müllner E.W. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Iron was modulated by culturing cells for 20 h in medium with 100 μmdesferrioxamine (Desferal; a gift from Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland) or for an additional 4 h with 60 μg/ml of ferric ammonium citrate (Sigma). In some experiments, L cells were incubated for 45 min in medium with 100 μm H2O2(Fluka, Switzerland) without fetal calf serum (essentially iron-free) to prevent the toxic effect of iron combined with H2O2. Where indicated, 1 h before the addition of iron-rich medium, 100 μm MG132 (peptide aldehyde) (ProScript, Cambridge, MA) was added and maintained for 4 h. IRE mutants with different loop sequences were inserted as oligonucleotides into the 5′-UTR of the vector pL5-GH containing a ferritin promoter and the hGH gene (43Hentze M.W. Caughman S.W.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides with the sequence GATCCTGCTTCAANNNNNNTTGGACGGACGGATCTT (where N represents different loop sequences) were inserted between the BamHI andXbaI sites of pL5-GH, nine nucleotides downstream of the RNA cap site.

Hentze, EMBL, Heidelberg. Sub-confluent Ltk− cells were co-transfected with a plasmid containing the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene using the calcium phosphate method (44Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in methionine-free medium for 90 min, and then labeled with 40 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) for 2–4 h. hGH was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of secreted35S-labeled protein (105 cpm, determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation) with a specific rabbit polyclonal antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), followed by protein A-Sepharose. Samples were analyzed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and35S-labeled hGH was quantitated with a Compaq PhosphorImager equipped with Molecular Dynamics Image software. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by cell lysis of 35S-labeled cell populations with 0.3% Nonidet P-40 (8Müllner E.W. Neupert B. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Extracts were mixed with specific IRE probes to detect IRP-1 and/or IRP-2. Cytoplasmic protein (2 μg) was incubated for 10 min in lysis buffer with 2 × 104 cpm of gel-purified 32P-labeled IRE (specific activity: 1.3 × 109 dpm/μg). The 32P-labeled IRE probes were prepared by in vitro transcription of linearized plasmids pGEM-3zf containing IRE inserts in the presence of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) (39Henderson B.R.

Where specified, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol was added to activate IRP-1 in vitro. RNA-protein complexes were analyzed in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (8Müllner E.W. Neupert B. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from 3 × 107 cells using the RNeasy Kit of Qiagen Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). Equal amounts of RNA (8 μg) were separated in 1.2% agarose gels in the presence of formaldehyde, transferred to GeneScreen Plus nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products), and cross-linked with ultraviolet light. Equal loading was assessed from the ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNA prior to the transfer. Filters were hybridized with a random-primed32P-labeled probe comprising the 600-bp SmaI fragment of the hGH gene (45Goossen B. Caughman S.W. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4127-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The iron-responsive element, first identified by phylogenetic comparison in the 5′-UTR of ferritin mRNA (5Aziz N. Munro H.N.

Chem. 1987; 262: 7335-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is highly conserved in evolution. The “consensus” IRE has a loop sequence CAGUGN and an unpaired cytosine immediately 5′ of 5 paired nucleotides forming the “upper stem” (reviewed in Refs. 3Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar and 47Kühn L.C. Hentze M.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By employing in vitro screening procedures, we have recently identified alternative IRE loop sequences that preferentially bind to IRP-1 (39Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Bonnard C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17481-17489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or IRP-2 (40Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed different IRE mutants for their ability to control translation when placed in the 5′-UTR of a hGH reporter construct (Fig.1). The mutant IRE with the loop sequenceG 1AGUC 5G (mutant GC6) was chosen as it binds to both IRP-1 and IRP-2 in vitro (40Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, the loop sequencesU 1AGUA 5C (mutant UA34) and CC 2GA 4GC (mutant CG125) were tested because of their exclusive interaction with IRP-1 or IRP-2, respectively (39Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Bonnard C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17481-17489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As a positive control for translation regulation, we analyzed pFer-GH, a construct which carries the ferritin H-chain wild-type IRE (15Dandekar T. Stripecke R. Gray N.K. Goossen B. Constable A. Johansson H.E. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1903-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A mutant IRE containing the loop sequenceGCUCCG (mutant GC1) served as a negative control since it binds to neither IRP-1 nor IRP-2 in vitro (40Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The hGH constructs were stably transfected into mouse L cells and proteins labeled with [35S]methionine in iron-deprived (Des) or iron-rich (Fe) cell cultures. Following35S-labeling, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared to confirm the activation and specificity of IRP-1 and IRP-2 by gel retardation analysis (Fig. 1 A). Both proteins were activated in iron-deficient cells and bound strongly to the 32P-labeled wild-type ferritin IRE (probe CG42 of Ref. 39Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Bonnard C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17481-17489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as to the mutant IRE GC6, as expected (40Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the IRE UA34 detected only IRP-1, while the CG125 probe identified IRP-2 specifically, as previously observed (40Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The negative control, GC1, revealed no binding to either protein. In cell extracts of iron-replete cells, inactive IRP-1 was fully activated by pre-incubation with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) (Fig. 1 A, lower panel), whereas RNA-binding activity of IRP-2 could be re-activated 3–4-fold by 2-ME only in extracts of iron-deprived, but not iron-replete cells. This finding is consistent with the degradation of IRP-2 in iron-replete cells (33Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and suggests that some IRP-2 molecules are inactivated by oxidation in the iron-deprived cell extract, as previously observed (36Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20509-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Translation assays were performed by immunoprecipitation of secreted 35S-labeled hGH (Fig. 1 B). In iron-deprived cells, diminished translation was observed for all IRE mutants, except for GC1, without a concomitant change in hGH mRNA levels (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that IRP-1 and/or IRP-2 activated by desferrioxamine bind to the IRE mutants and thereby diminish hGH translation as compared with the situation in iron-replete cells. In agreement with previous data (48Goossen B. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1959-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the control ferritin IRE-hGH construct was 10-fold repressed in translation after desferrioxamine treatment (Table I). Translational inhibition mediated by the IRE mutants GC6, UA34, and CG125 was somewhat weaker (Table I) and seemed to correlate with lowerin vitro binding affinities of mutant IREs in competition assays (39Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Bonnard C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17481-17489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The GC6 mutant, which binds both IRPs 2.5 times less efficiently than a wild-type IRE, mediated a translation inhibition of only 40%. The mutants UA34 and CG125, despite being almost equivalent to the wild-type IRE as competitors, but very specific only for one or the other IRP, mediated only a 4- or 2.5-fold reduction of hGH translation, respectively. Thus, one has to be cautious in predicting the precise effect of a given mutant on the basis of in vitro measurements. Differences in the absolute mRNA levels in different cell populations probably did not affect the extent of translational regulation. In all cell populations, an excess of unbound IRP could be measured in gel retardation assays (Fig. 1 A). This excess was not strongly affected in cells with higher mRNA levels. One cannot argue, therefore, that the trans-acting IRPs were titrated out by the transfected mRNA.Table ICorrelation between relative binding affinities and translation inhibitionIREKrelin vitro1-aRelative affinities were previously published (39,40).

Open table in a new tab Another study has reported iron-independent enhancement of translation by a 5′-IRE but showed that this effect was insensitive to a mutation in the IRE loop (49Dix D.J. Lin P.-N. Kimata Y. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2818-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our present results are in agreement since translation efficiencies in iron-rich medium varied less than 1.4-fold between different cell populations excluding a positive effect on translation due to mutations in the loop. Most importantly, the present data show that alternative IRE loop sequences with a sub-optimal binding to IRP-1 or IRP-2 are effective ascis-acting regulatory elements in cells. Moreover, an IRE that binds exclusively to IRP-2 in vitro (CG125) appears to be sufficient to confer iron-dependent translational regulation, indicating that IRP-2 itself acts as a genuine translation regulator. The results of Fig. 1 do not exclude the possibility that activated IRP-1 in cells may cross-react with the IRP-2-specific IRE. Therefore, experiments were performed under conditions in which only IRP-1 was activated. Transfected L cells were pre-treated for 2 h with ferric ammonium citrate to reduce IRP RNA-binding activities and then incubated for 45 min with 100 μm H2O2, which is known to specifically and rapidly induce IRP-1 (28Martins E.A.L. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Indeed, in gel retardation assays with extracts from H2O2-treated cells, we detected only complexes of IRP-1 with the wild-type ferritin and the UA34 IRE probes (Fig.2 A). No complexes were visible for IRP-2, either with the wild-type IRE or with the IRP-2-specific probe CG125 (Fig. 2 A, lane 6), indicating that IRP-2 was not activated by H2O2. Immunoprecipitation of the secreted 35S-labeled hGH revealed that H2O2-activated IRP-1 prevents translation when bound to the ferritin IRE (Fig. 2 B). This agrees with findings by others (30Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A clear inhibition was also observed with the IRP-1-specific UA34 construct (Fig. 2 B), indicating that IRP-1 activation alone is sufficient to repress translation. However, despite a strongly induced IRP-1 activity, no regulation was observed with the IRP-2-specific IRE CG125 and the negative mutant IRE GC1. These findings indicate that IRP-1 does not bind to the IRP-2-specific IRE in cells, and confirms that the regulation mediated by CG125 in iron-deficient cells (Fig. 1) cannot be attributed to IRP-1, but depends only on IRP-2. Attempts were also made to study the question by selectively inactivating cellular IRP-1 but not IRP-2. Ltk− cells were pre-incubated with 100 μm MG132, a proteasome inhibitor thought to prevent IRP-2 degradation specifically (37Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 38Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5357-5360Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and then exposed to 60 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate to fully inactivate IRP-1. We found that not only was IRP-2 degradation inhibited, but the inactivation of IRP-1 was also partly prevented. Its RNA-binding activity in the presence of MG132 for 4 h remained 1.6-fold higher than without MG132 (data not shown). It was not possible, therefore, to obtain cells with active IRP-2 alone. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that both endogenous IRP-1 and IRP-2 function as translation repressors in mammalian cells. This finding extends those of previous studies demonstrating that exogenously expressed IRP-1 acts as a translational repressor (50Stripecke R. Oliveira C.C. McCarthy J.E.G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5898-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 51DeRusso P.A. Philpott C.C. Iwai K. Mostowski H.S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15451-15454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that recombinant IRP-1 and IRP-2 repress ferritin mRNA translation in reticulocyte lysates (52Kim H.Y. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4983-4986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and wheat germ extracts (33Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in vitro. We can conclude, therefore, that both IRPs, when simultaneously activated by iron-deprivation or NO-synthase induction, exert a combined effect in cells. As the two proteins have a relatively early evolutionary origin and were detected both in insects and mammals (53Rothenberger S. Müllner E.W. Kühn L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1175-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it remains to be explained why, during evolution, organisms have acquired and maintained such a duplication of function. One possible reason could relate to a potentially broader and more differentiated response to distinct signals. Hydrogen peroxide was reported to induce only IRP-1 activity, whereas IRP-2 could be detected with preference in certain cells or tissues (32Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27327-27334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Guo B. Brown F.M. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16529-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and under certain inductive conditions in erythroid cells (54Chan R.Y.Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Kühn L.C. Ponka P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and rat liver (55Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6405-6409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another reason for the maintenance of two IRE-binding proteins may relate to the potential of specific targets. Although no naturally occurring IRP-1- or IRP-2-specific IRE sequences have yet been identified, there is a clear potential for the existence of mRNAs with such sequences. The results of the present study, which show that sub-optimal affinities of IRE-IRP interactions are sufficient for translational control, therefore suggest these RNA-binding proteins may mediate other novel functions within cells."

https://openalex.org/W1548770619,"The prominence of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in rodent thymic neurons suggested that this potent mediator of T cell functions may alter developmental responses of thymocytes to T cell receptor (TCR) -dependent stimulation. CD4+8+ DPK cells derived from a thymic lymphoma of a TCR transgenic mouse respond to pigeon cytochrome C (PCC) antigen in association with distinct I-E MHC II haplotypes on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by differentiating into CD4+8- T cells. The specific recognition of VIP by two types of homologous G-protein-coupled receptors (VIPR1 and VIPR2) on DPK cells was attributable predominantly to VIPR1 before and to VIPR2 after exposure to APCs and PCC, as assessed by quantification of the respective mRNAs. PCC-evoked differentiation of DPK cells was enhanced significantly by 1 to 100 nM VIP after 3 to 4 days. The effects of VIP analogs with VIPR type selectivity implied that VIP enhancement of differentiation of DPK cells was mediated principally by VIPR2. Differential reduction in the expression of each type of VIPR by transfection of DPK cells with plasmids encoding the respective antisense mRNAs confirmed the central role of VIPR2 in VIP-enhanced conversion to CD4+8- T cells. The suppression of DPK cell differentiation by inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A suggested a transductional role for VIP-elicited increases in [cAMP]i. That the changes in frequency of CD4+8+ and CD4+8- DPK cells reflected principally differentiation was supported by the lack of consistent differences between the two subsets in the effects of VIP and VIPR2 agonist on cell number, viability, apoptosis, and proliferation. VIP may be one endogenous mediator that explains the unique thymic microenvironment for topographically specific development of T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1909847438,"The immediate effects of oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) on the metabolic activity of cultured macrophages (RAW 264.7) were studied using a microphysiometer. Administration of OxLDL acutely induced a concentration-dependent increase in metabolic activity, with an EC50 of 16 +/- 3 microg/ml OxLDL and a maximal effect of 35% +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM; n=5). A biphasic response was measured after administration of 75 or 100 microg/ml OxLDL consisting of an initial sharp increase, followed by the induction of a long-lasting hypoactivity of 80% of the control value. Incubation of cells with polyinosinic acid (polyI; 100 microg/ml) for 30 min prior to OxLDL administration could completely block the effect of 25 microg/ml OxLDL. In addition, polyI acted as a full antagonist on the decrease of the biphasic response of cells generated by 75 and 100 microg/ml OxLDL. Macrophages used in this study possessed a specific binding site for OxLDL, with a dissociation constant (KD) of 9 +/- 2 microg/ml and a maximal binding of 610 +/- 32 ng 125I-OxLDL/mg cell protein. Binding of 125I-OxLDL to macrophages could be completely competed for by unlabeled OxLDL, by polyI for 58%, and by AcLDL for 46%. In conclusion, OxLDL can acutely activate the metabolic state of macrophages by a receptor-mediated process in a concentration-dependent fashion, which could be antagonized by polyI. Metabolic responses to OxLDL may underlie the changes observed in macrophages in the early atherosclerotic plaque."

Inhibition of proteinases by human α2-macroglobulin (α2M) 1The abbreviations used are: α2M, α2-macroglobulin; TNS, 6-(p-toluidino)-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. results from a series of conformational changes that are initiated by the proteinase and that result in the physical sequestration of the proteinase within the closed cage-like structure of the conformationally altered α2M (1Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Wagenknecht T. Bretaudiere J.-P. Tapon-Bretaudiere J. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1992; 109: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Stoops J.K. Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Strickland D.K. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 212-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The initiating event is a proteolytic cleavage by the attacking proteinase near the center of the α2M polypeptide in a region termed the bait region (3Sottrup-Jensen L. Lønblad P.B. Stepanik T.M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Jörnvall H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 127: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Sottrup-Jensen L. Sand O. Kristensen L. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15781-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage anywhere within the bait region also results in activation of an internal thiol ester toward cleavage by nucleophiles. From studies on the kinetics of cleavage of the thiol ester by nucleophiles and of the subsequent conformational change within the α2M, it has been shown that the conformational change occurs cooperatively after both thiol esters within one half of the α2M tetramer have been cleaved (5Strickland D.K. Bhattacharya P. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3115-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Larsson L.-J. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1585-1593Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the structural relationship between the thiol ester and the bait region and hence of the details of the activation mechanism is limited by the absence of a high resolution x-ray structure of either native or conformationally altered human α2M. From fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements, it was shown that the four cysteines that form the four thiol esters of the human α2M tetramer are centrally located and are about 35 Å apart (7Gettins P. Beechem J.M. Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7747-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This was subsequently confirmed by a low resolution (∼10 Å) x-ray structure of conformationally altered α2M (8Andersen G.R. Koch T.J. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Nyborg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25133-25141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NMR measurements on α2M showed that the bait region of each monomer was unusually flexible (9Gettins P. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Arakawa H. Muto Y. Arata Y. Ikai A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and that it lies close (10–17 Å) to the cysteine of the thiol ester in the transformed protein (11Gettins P. Beth A.H. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the location of the four bait regions is still not known. Studies from this laboratory on α2M variants in which large portions of the bait region had been removed showed that bait region truncation prevented the disulfide-linked α2M dimers from associating noncovalently to give the functional tetramer (12Gettins P.G.W. Hahn K. Crews B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14160-14167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and that, despite normal reactivity of the thiol esters toward nucleophiles, there was no cooperativity of conformational change between subunits. This implicated the bait region in formation of the α2M tetramer and raised the possibility that the bait regions may lie in the central cavity of α2M in contact with one another. This is made more plausible by the presence of a symmetrical body of electron density in the central cavity of methylamine-treated α2M, termed the “cavity body,” that is absent from proteolytically cleaved α2M (8Andersen G.R. Koch T.J. Dolmer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Nyborg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25133-25141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the bait region is involved in the noncovalent association of α2M dimers and in the mediation of cooperative subunit-subunit interactions that are involved in the gross trapping conformational changes of α2M, we used a scanning mutagenesis approach in which four single residue substitution variants of human α2M containing a cysteine at distal, central, or proximal ends of the bait region have been prepared and characterized (G679C, M690C, V700C, and T705C) (Fig.1). The variants folded normally, as judged by several properties, including the formation of tetrameric α2M, the presence of thiol esters with normal reactivity toward nucleophiles, and the ability to undergo a proteinase-induced conformational change. However, the extent and rate of conformational change induced by methylamine cleavage of the thiol esters was compromised for all of the variants. Although all of the variants could still inhibit proteinase, the stoichiometries were reduced compared with wild-type recombinant α2M or plasma α2M. These perturbed properties correlated with the presence of new interdimer disulfide bonds formed between the new cysteine residues in two otherwise noncovalently associated disulfide-linked dimers. Such cross-linking resulted in covalent tetramers with either one or two new disulfides between the dimers. The extent of formation of such new disulfides was a function of the position of the cysteine within the bait region. This suggests that the bait regions are involved both in dimer-dimer association and in mediation of trans-dimer conformational changes and that there is a requirement for unrestrained reorientation of the bait region interface. In addition, the M690C variant showed evidence of a new intradimer disulfide, suggesting that bait regions within a dimer are also close to one another. These findings suggest that all four of the bait regions are at the center of the α2M cavity and may constitute all or part of the cavity body seen in the low resolution x-ray structure of transformed α2M. For circumstantial reasons, the four mutations were not all created by the same procedure. For the variants G679C and V700C, site-directed mutagenesis was performed in a single-stranded M13mp18 construct containing the 1690-base pair BamHI toBsiWI fragment from plasmid p1167 (13Boel E. Kristensen T. Petersen C.M. Mortensen S.B. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4081-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which covers the coding region for the bait region. Mutagenesis was carried out using the Amersham Corp. in vitro Mutagenesis System 2.1 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing, after which the mutated BamHI toBsiWI fragment was excised and ligated back into the p1167 expression vector. The M690C variant was created by mutagenesis using the Altered Sites II Mutagenesis System (Promega) on the 2669-base pairBamHI to ClaI fragment from p1167 subcloned into pAlter (Promega). The 28-base oligonucleotide 5′-T GAG TCA GAT GTATGT GGA AGA GGC CAT-3′ was used for the mutagenesis. After confirmation of the mutation in pAlter, the mutated BamHI toClaI fragment was excised and religated into p1167. The T705C variant was created in two stages. In the first step, anXmaI site was introduced at base 3572 of p1167 using the Amersham Corp. in vitro Mutagenesis System 2.1 protocol. The mutation at residue 705 was then introduced by replacing theXmaI to BsiWI fragment of p1167 with a synthetic duplex containing the desired change. This duplex was formed by annealing oligonucleotides 5′-CC GGG TGT GAG ACC-3′ and 5′-C TAC CGT CTC ACA C-3′. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing in p1167. Stably transfected BHK cell lines expressing each of the four α2M variants were established by the co-transfection and drug resistance selection procedures previously described (14Pederson L.C.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12233-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Plasma α2M was isolated from outdated human plasma obtained from Rush University Hospital Blood Bank. The α2M was precipitated in a 4–12% cut with PEG8000 and collected as a pellet by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.8 m sodium chloride and chromatographed on a zinc chelate matrix, as described previously (16Dangott L.J. Cunningham L.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recombinant α2Ms were obtained from the growth medium of the stably transfected BHK cells that were grown to confluence in roller bottles and cycled between serum-containing and serum-free medium, as described previously (15Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12233-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Purification was by zinc chelate chromatography, as for plasma α2M, but without the PEG8000 precipitation step. Polyacrylamide gels run under denaturing and reducing conditions (8% acrylamide) or denaturing and nonreducing conditions (3.5% acrylamide cast on Pharmacia Gel Bond film) were run according to the procedure of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing gels (5% acrylamide) were run as described previously (18Bowen M.E. Armstrong P.B. Quigley J.P. Gettins P.G.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Urea polyacrylamide gels (5% acrylamide) contained 5m urea and were run in the same way as nondenaturing gels. Both kinetic and wavelength scan fluorescence measurements were made on an SLM8000 spectrofluorometer. Kinetic measurements used excitation at 316 nm and observation of emission at 410 nm, with slits of 4 and 16 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Wavelength scans used excitation at 316 nm and emission monitored in 2-nm steps from 360 to 600 nm. Slits of 2 nm for both excitation and emission were used. Determination of both the number and kinetics of cleavage of thiol esters present in the variants were carried out by continuous monitoring of the free SH (sulfhydryl) released from the thiol ester by reaction with methylamine, by spectrophotometric measurement of the TNB− released by reaction of the free SH with DTNB. TNB− was quantitated from the change in absorbance at 412 nm using an extinction coefficient of 13,600m−1 cm−1 (19Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21471) Google Scholar). For kinetic measurements, the α2M (final concentration, 1.0 μm) was preincubated in assay buffer containing 100 μm DTNB. The reaction was initiated by addition of amine hydrochloride stock solution (5 m, pH 8.0) to give the desired final concentration. Measurements were made in a dual beam Shimadzu UV2101PC spectrophotometer; the blank contained all components except α2M. Data were fitted by nonlinear least squares analysis to a monoexponential using Scientist (MicroMath, Salt Lake City, UT). Stoichiometry of trypsin trapping was determined by measuring the soybean trypsin inhibitor-resistant trypsin activity (20Björk I. Larsson L.-J. Lindblom T. Raub E. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Björk I. Lindblom T. Lindahl P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2653-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) at different trypsin:α2M ratios. α2M (120 nm) was incubated with different molar ratios of trypsin for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was diluted 1:1 with a solution of soybean trypsin inhibitor (final concentration, 1.25 mm). After 1 min of incubation, residual trypsin activity, representing α2M-trapped trypsin, was assayed by addition of 10 μl of the reaction mixture to 190 μl of assay buffer containing 200 μm (final concentration)N-benzoyl-l-isoleucyl-l-glutamylglycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (S-2222, Chromogenix) in a microcuvette. Change in absorbance at 410 nm, relative to a reference cell containing only substrate, was monitored using a dual beam Shimadzu 2101PC spectrophotometer. Trypsin activities were determined from the slope of the resulting time courses, fitted by least squares linear fit using the program Origin 1.16 (MicroCal Inc., Amherst, MA). All reactions and assays were carried out in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m sodium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% PEG8000. Following reaction with methylamine or proteinase, human plasma α2M undergoes a major change in conformation that results in an increase in electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels run under nondenaturing conditions (22Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This “slow to fast” conversion is frequently used as a diagnostic for this major conformational change, with the result that α2M conformations are often referred to as the slow form or fast form. In addition, there is an intermediate mobility species in which conformational change has occurred in only two of the four subunits (6Larsson L.-J. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1585-1593Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar,23Gettins P. Crews B.C. Cunningham L.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5613-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of the four α2M variants to undergo this slow to intermediate or slow to fast form interconversion upon reaction with either methylamine or proteinase. All four variants had the expected slow mobility prior to reaction (Fig.2) that is characteristic of tetrameric α2M in the native state. Reaction with a small excess of proteinase (trypsin) for 10 min was sufficient to completely convert each of the variants from slow to fast conformations (Fig. 2). However, methylamine treatment overnight produced only partial conversion to a mixture of slow, intermediate, and fast forms for all of the variants, with each variant giving different extents of conversion to intermediate and fast forms (Fig. 2). The M690C variant was least converted to fast or intermediate mobility species, whereas the other three showed the presence of about one-third to one-half fast form and a smaller amount of intermediate mobility species. Recombinant wild-type α2M was completely converted to the fast form by methylamine treatment under the same conditions (Fig. 2), as was plasma α2M (not shown). The failure of the variants to be completely converted to the fast form was not due to incomplete cleavage of the thiol esters by methylamine (see below). We also followed the rate of conversion of the variants from slow to intermediate or fast conformations as a function of time of reaction with methylamine at pH 8 by nondenaturing PAGE. The appearance of the intermediate and fast mobility species was complete within 2 h, after which no further changes were observed up to the longest time examined of 24 h (data not shown). Therefore, although the variants initially have uniform slow mobility, they are heterogeneous with respect to the ability to undergo change from slow to intermediate or fast mobility species. Because of the limited quantities available for some of the variants, the number of free thiols present initially in each of the variants was estimated by reaction with 5-iodoacetamido fluorescein rather than by DTNB assay because this gave higher sensitivity and allowed fluorescence quantitation. When allowance was made for a small amount of nonspecific labeling, which was also present in recombinant wild-type α2M, there was little evidence of a significant fraction of the new cysteine residues being in unconjugated form (TableI), suggesting that the new cysteines introduced into the bait region were all involved in disulfide linkages, either to other cysteines within the tetrameric protein or to small thiols, such as glutathione.Table IProperties of control and variant α 2 Msα2-MacroglobulinFree SH1-aFree SH present after purification, quantitated by reaction with 5-iodoacetamido fluorescein.Thiol esters1-bThiol esters present quantitated by DTNB assay of free SH generated by reaction to completion with methylamine.Trypsin trapped1-cMoles of trypsin trapped by the α2-macroglobulin tetramer.Trypsin activity1-dActivity of trapped trypsin relative to that for trypsin trapped by recombinant wild-type α2M.k 11-eSecond-order rate constant for cleavage of thiol esters by methylamine.k c1-fFirst-order rate constant for rapid phase of the conformational change detected by change in TNS fluorescence.m−1s−1s−1PlasmaND2.9 ± 0.071.50.694.9 ± 0.10.022 ± 0.004Wild-type recombinant0.393.7 ± 0.21.31.003.8 ± 0.60.018 ± 0.0002G679C0.622.6 ± 0.060.50.422.4 ± 0.90.013 ± 0.001M690C0.263.0 ± 0.90.60.202.5 ± 1.00.0074 ± 0.0001V700C0.732.6 ± 0.20.40.402.8 ± 0.90.0094 ± 0.0015T705C0.572.0 ± 0.30.50.153.0 ± 0.80.010 ± 0.0041-a Free SH present after purification, quantitated by reaction with 5-iodoacetamido fluorescein.1-b Thiol esters present quantitated by DTNB assay of free SH generated by reaction to completion with methylamine.1-c Moles of trypsin trapped by the α2-macroglobulin tetramer.1-d Activity of trapped trypsin relative to that for trypsin trapped by recombinant wild-type α2M.1-e Second-order rate constant for cleavage of thiol esters by methylamine.1-f First-order rate constant for rapid phase of the conformational change detected by change in TNS fluorescence. Open table in a new tab The number of intact thiol esters present was also determined by DTNB assay, which involved reaction of the variants with methylamine and quantitation of the free SH generated (Fig.3). From analysis of the time dependence of the change in absorbance at 412 nm, both the total number of methylamine-cleavable thiol esters and the kinetics of their cleavage were determined (Table I). By both criteria, all four of the variants were similar to both plasma and recombinant wild-type α2Ms, having between two and four intact thiol esters that could be cleaved at rates that were 63–79% that of recombinant wild-type α2M. These results indicated that the mutations had not greatly altered either the ability of the α2M subunits to form thiol esters or the subsequent reactivity of the thiol esters toward small nucleophiles. The lower stoichiometry of thiol esters for the V700C and T705C variants correlated with the presence of a small amount of intermediate mobility material prior to reaction (Fig. 2). This form is likely to have only two intact thiol esters. However, the major species had slow electrophoretic mobility and probably contained three or four intact thiol esters. The conformational changes that accompany reaction with proteinase were complete within the 10 min used for the reaction, so the TNS emission spectrum was stable after this time. Comparison of the TNS emission spectra for unreacted and proteinase-reacted variants with those for plasma α2M showed significant differences for both the starting and the finishing conformations (Fig. 4). TNS in the presence of plasma α2M gave an emission spectrum with λmax at about 440 nm. Upon reaction with proteinase, the TNS fluorescence intensity increased more than 2-fold, and the wavelength maximum blue shifted from 440 to about 410 nm (Fig. 4). The same behavior was seen for wild-type recombinant α2M (Fig. 4). In contrast, TNS in the presence of any of the four variants already showed enhanced intensity, and wavelength maxima between those of native and trypsin-treated wild-type or plasma α2Ms (Fig. 4). Reaction of the variants with either chymotrypsin or trypsin produced very little additional increase for the M690C and T705C variants, and a reduction in intensity for the G679C and V700C variants. Almost no change in emission maximum was seen for the M690C and T705C variants after reaction with either trypsin or chymotrypsin. Although small blue shifts were observed upon proteinase treatment of the G679C and V700C variants, the wavelength maxima of the proteinase-treated variant was still not as much blue shifted as wild-type or plasma α2M. Methylamine treatment resulted in almost no change in wavelength maximum for any of the variants and much smaller percentages of enhancement for any of the variants, particularly T705C, than for recombinant wild-type or plasma α2Ms. The ability of each variant to inhibit trypsin by the normal bait region cleavage-induced conformational change was determined by a trapping assay in which increasing amounts of trypsin were incubated with each α2M variant, and any nontrapped trypsin was inhibited by addition of a large excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The residual trypsin activity was then determined by chromogenic assay. The stoichiometry of trapping was determined from the turnover point of a plot of residual activity against the trypsin:α2M ratio (not shown). Each variant was able to trap trypsin, but the stoichiometry was greatly reduced compared with plasma and wild-type recombinant α2Ms (Table I), despite complete and specific cleavage of all four of the bait regions (Fig.5). The activity of trypsin trapped by each of the variants was also reduced from that trapped by wild-type α2M (Table I). The largest reductions in specific activity were seen for the M690C and T705C variants. From the above characterization of the four variants, it is clear that, whereas they behave normally in forming tetramers with intact thiol esters that are cleavable by methylamine at normal rates and bait regions that are still specifically cleavable by proteinase, their ability to undergo rapid cooperative conformational changes and to efficiently trap 1–2 mol of proteinase has been compromised by the introduction of cysteine into the bait region. We therefore determined whether the aberrant properties arose from the presence of new disulfides within the tetramer. Plasma α2-macroglobulin is a tetramer, made up of two noncovalently associated disulfide-linked dimers (24Jensen P.E.H. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15863-15869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon treatment with either urea (Fig. 6 A) or SDS (Fig. 6, B and C), the noncovalent interactions can be disrupted, and the protein migrates as an ∼360-kDa dimer. We found that all of the cysteine variants showed evidence of the presence of additional disulfide bonds between the dimers, from the presence of nondissociable 720-kDa tetramers (Fig. 6). Such behavior could result from either one or two additional disulfides between the dimers. In each case, a minority of the protein lacked such additional interdimer disulfides and was still dissociable to dimer. This varied among the variants and was the greatest for the T705C variant (Fig. 6). Another difference between variants was that the M690C variant showed a different mobility for its dimer compared with the dimers of the other variants when dissociation was carried out in SDS (Fig. 6 C), but less so when carried out with urea (Fig. 6 A). This may be due to the presence of a new intradimer disulfide in a fraction of the subunits that may constrain the conformation of the SDS-unfolded protein so that it has a different mobility from the equivalently unfolded dimers that do not contain such an additional disulfide. SDS-PAGE run under reducing conditions confirmed that all of the variants were composed of the expected 180-kDa monomers and that the bait regions were all accessible to proteinase and could be cleaved upon exposure to trypsin (Fig. 5). The time-course of change in mobility of the variants on nondenaturing PAGE showed that only a fraction of each variant showed conversion at rates similar to that of wild-type or plasma α2M when reacted with methylamine (see above). To test whether there was an equivalent fraction that also showed normal kinetics of conformational change, we followed the time-dependence of the TNS fluorescence change upon reaction with methylamine (Fig. 7) and determined the rate constant for the change. For all four variants it appeared that there was a rapid phase of smaller magnitude than for wild-type α2M, that was equivalent to the normal conformational change step of recombinant wild-type and plasma α2Ms, because the fluorescence changes were well fitted to a monoexponential, as expected for the conditions of the reaction, and gave rate constants (kc) no more than about 3-fold slower than those for plasma and wild-type recombinant α2Ms (Table I). We have examined four variants of human α2M, each of which contains a single cysteine at a different location within the bait region, to test the involvement of the bait region in dimer-dimer association and in the mechanism of conformational change and proteinase inhibition by determining the tendency of these variants to form new interdimer disulfides and thereby alter the properties of the α2M. We found that a major fraction of each of the four variants formed new interdimer cross-links, suggesting a very close approach of bait regions in separate dimers to one another in the tetramer and consequently a location for the bait regions at the interface between these dimers. These new cross-links blocked the conformational change that occurs upon cleavage of the thiol esters by nucleophiles and suggests that the bait regions not only are in contact with one another across the dimer-dimer interface but also mediate the cooperative conformational changes that constitute the slow to fast form interconversion, perhaps through a rearrangement of their contact surfaces. Formation of a new disulfide cross-link between pairs of bait regions across the interface may lock the interface so that conformational changes can only occur very slowly or not at all compared with the unconstrained bait regions of wild-type recombinant or plasma α2Ms. Consistent with this is the greatly lowered ability of the variants to trap trypsin, even though trypsin completely and specifically cleaved all bait regions in each of the variants. The finding that cysteine at different positions within the bait region is able to cross-link to a bait region of the other dimer with different efficiencies suggests that the interface is more complex than a parallel alignment of bait regions. Instead, different parts of the bait region must approach the equivalent residue in the other dimer to greater or lesser extents. In addition, the possible formation of a new disulfide between monomers of the same dimer in the M690C variant suggests that the bait regions within a dimer may approach one another at this point. This suggests an organization of the four bait regions of human α2M in the central cavity of the tetramer, perhaps as the cavity body of the x-ray structure, with extensive interaction between pairs of bait regions from different dimers and less extensive contact between pairs from the same dimer (Fig.8). A possible concern in trying to deduce structural properties of plasma α2M from the properties of these variants is that formation of a new disulfide between dimers might have grossly distorted the interface that results in the normal dimer-dimer association and thus either precluded tetramer formation or driven the tetramer into a distorted structure that is not representative of native α2M. However, by several criteria, this appears not to be the case for these variants, because they possess a number of structurally dependent properties that are very similar to those of plasma α2M. Thus, all four variants form tetramer as the nearly exclusive species, with the exception of M690C and V700C, which also form a small amount of dimer. This contrasts with more drastically modified bait region variants that we have previously examined, which had large truncations within the bait region and that consequently formed exclusively dimers that could not associate to tetramer (12Gettins P.G.W. Hahn K. Crews B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14160-14167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The present variants also form close to the full complement of thiol esters that can be cleaved by nucleophiles at rates very similar to plasma or recombinant wild-type α2M (Table I). They are also capable of undergoing complete slow to fast conformational change upon reaction with proteinase. The presence of new interdimer disulfides is therefore likely to result from the juxtaposition of the new cysteines across the dimer-dimer interface as a consequence of initial dimer-dimer association in the normal manner. This then requires the bait regions to be directly involved in dimer-dimer interactions in plasma α2M. Such involvement of the bait regions of different dimers in the noncovalent interface of α2M is not surprising, given the cooperative nature of the conformational changes that result from bait region or thiol ester cleavage. Earlier studies by Roche et al. on chemical cross-linking of subunits of α2M (25Roche P.A. Jensen P.E.H. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Roche P.A. Moncino M.D. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7629-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) had already shown that covalent cross-links could lead to a rigidification of the α2M interface such that it no longer responded normally to bait region or thiol ester cleavage. However, unambiguous interpretation of these earlier studies was not possible because numerous cross-links were always present and the sites of cross-linking were unknown. In contrast, it was seen in the present study that the introduction of one or two interdimer cross-links between residues within the bait region leads to a blockage of the thiol ester cleavage-induced conformational change, as evidenced both by incomplete conversion from slow to fast forms after cleavage of the thiol esters by methylamine and by the small fraction of each variant that shows near-normal conformational change reported by changes in TNS fluorescence. Even when conformational change is brought about by proteinase cleavage of the bait region, there is evidence from the greatly lowered efficiency of proteinase trapping (Table I) that the structural rearrangements may have been slowed down. Such changes in efficiency of proteinase trapping as a function of the relative rates of cleavage and conformational change have been documented for plasma α2M and trypsin (27Larsson L.-J. Neuenschwander D.E. Strickland D.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7636-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Strickland D.K. Larsson L.-J. Neuenschwander D.E. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2797-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This suggests that when the thiol esters alone are cleaved, the conformational change that occurs cooperatively between noncovalently interacting subunits across the dimer-dimer interface involves a reorganization of the bait region-bait region contact area. By introducing a disulfide between such pairs of bait regions, as in any of the four variants considered here, this reorganization is either halted or greatly slowed down. The observation that this blockage of movement is much less when the bait region is cleaved by proteinase, such that all of the α2M is in the fast form in less than 10 min, is quite consistent with and even supportive of such a model, in that the cleavage by proteinase, which is specifically restricted to the bait region, could isolate the disulfide cross-link from the parts of the bait region that need to move relative to one another, thereby freeing them to reorient and thus abrogating the blockage of conformational change. Our proposed location of the four bait regions at the center of the α2M tetramer in the position of the cavity body found in the crystal structure of methylamine-transformed α2M is also consistent with the changes in TNS fluorescence caused by proteinase treatment of the variants and of the reduced activity of trypsin in complex with these α2M variants. The location and size of the cavity body in the crystal structure of methylamine-transformed α2M is such that it would have to be removed in whole or in part to accommodate one or two proteinase molecules in the central cavity. If the bait regions constitute all or part of the cavity body, their cleavage by proteinase and the consequent reorientation of the interface, as suggested by results presented here, could constitute such a restructuring. For the four variants, we found that TNS fluorescence spectra not only were different from either native or transformed plasma α2M but also were much less responsive to change upon reaction with proteinase than was plasma α2M. This was particularly so for the M690C and T705C variants (Fig. 4). These are the variants that also show the lowest specific activity for trypsin that is trapped (Table I), suggesting that the trypsin may be very much more constrained in these variants than in plasma α2M. The G679C and V700C variants show somewhat higher specific activity for trapped trypsin and also give TNS fluorescence spectra for the proteinase-treated forms that are more like that of proteinase-treated plasma α2M. These findings for the four variants are consistent with bait region cleavage giving less complete interface restructuring than for plasma α2M as a result of the constraints imposed by the interdimer disulfides, with the consequence that the cavity body is not cleared out of the way as completely as in plasma α2M. This could also be the explanation for the lowered trapping ability of the variants, in that there is less volume available to form the trap. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that all four of the bait regions of human α2M are in contact with or are very close to one another, probably in the central cavity of the protein, and that the major conformational change that is required for proteinase trapping involves a reorientation of the bait region-bait region contacts both to bring about the trapping conformational change and to make room in the central cavity to accommodate the proteinase. Introduction of cross-links across this interface, either by disulfide formation, as described here, or by chemical cross-linking, as suggested elsewhere (25Roche P.A. Jensen P.E.H. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Roche P.A. Moncino M.D. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7629-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), slows or prevents this reorientation with consequent reduction in rate of conformational change and in efficiency of proteinase trapping.

https://openalex.org/W2117190494,"Interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) is a retinoid and fatty acid binding glycoprotein secreted by rod and cone photoreceptors in all vertebrates. IRBP is believed to serve as a carrier for retinoids in the bleaching and regeneration cycle of rhodopsin. IRBP protein has been found to be decreased in vitamin A-deprived rats; it is rapidly recovered after retinol repletion. To understand the mechanism for this recovery, we determined whether vitamin A affects transcription and translation of the IRBP gene. Wild-type and transgenic mice harboring the IRBP promoter-CAT reporter fusion gene were maintained on a retinol-deficient diet supplemented with retinoic acid (-A) or on a control diet (+A) for up to 60 wk postweaning. Some of the -A mice were given retinol repletion for 7 days (-A+A). Electroretinography analysis revealed alterations in waveform and a 2 log unit decrease in b-wave sensitivity in the -A mice over a broad range of stimulus wavelengths. Retinol repletion effected a full recovery. Immunochemistry showed a significant decrease in the immunogold-labeled IRBP between the retinal pigment epithelium and the outer segments of the -A mice compared with +A and -A+A mice. Northern blots showed no differences in the amounts of IRBP or CAT mRNA between these three treatment groups. These results suggest that the regulation of IRBP by retinol is not transcriptional."
